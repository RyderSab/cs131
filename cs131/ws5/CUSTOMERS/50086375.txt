This memoir tells of the author's troubled relationship with his alcoholic father, his mother's suicide, and the tendency of all the family members to get caught up in criminal activities and drug addiction...and to live marginal, unsettled lives. Flynn's father spends many of his adult years living on the streets of Boston. Father and son reconnect because the son works in a homeless shelter. The father claims to be a poet and to have written a ground-breaking novel that Little Brown is prepared to offer him $2 million to publish (or $4 million, depending on the time of day and the degree of his alcoholic grandiosity).  The literary connection between father and son is something that seems to haunt and frighten the younger Flynn. In the end, he seems to recognize that he is somehow his father's scribe and that the memoir he is writing is the \\"story\\" his father never mananged to get down on paper. \\"That book somehow fell to me, the son, to write. My father's uncredited, noncompliant ghostwriter. Not enough to be stuck with his body, to be stuck with his name, but to become his secretary, his handmaid, caught up in folly, a doomed project, to write about a book that doesn't, that didn't ever, that may not even , exist\\" (p. 322).<br /><br />what is ironic, and somehow true-seeming, is that people who come from the most disengaged families turn out to be the ones who become the most enmeshed with their parents and who come most dangerously close to repeating their parents' mistakes. Flynn has insight to his family dynamics, but this doesn't seem to help him avoid the poinlessness of numbing himself out on drugs and alcohol or from forming anything but superficial, need-based relationships with women. He does seem to progress from open fear and hate of his father to an authentic, but realistic sense of compassion for the man who was never there for him.<br /><br />ANOTHER NIGHT is pretty much a chronological account of Flynn's experiences, but it is written in various styles. Some of these work nicely and bring a welcome change of pace and infusion of energy to what is otherwise a depressing storyline. In a chapter called \\"Same Again\\" he does riffs on the varioius cliches about drinking you are likely to hear in a bar on any given night. The change of genre he does in the chapter \\"Santa Lear\\" seemed less successful. Here, he depicts as drama the exchanges between a number of drunks doing seasonal work as Santa Clauses and their \\"daughters\\" (social workers?). But overall, Flynn is a keen observer with a writing style that is poetic without being florid or unnecessarily terse. I'm curious to see what he'll produce next.experiences, but it is written in various styles.

It motivated me to read Palahniuk's novel which was the film's basis. The thinking, the cleverness, was there too. And though the novel was extreme, on the verge of being sci-fi or a futurist fable, there was something quite plausible about it as well. The emotional jadedness, the fear of emasculation, the fakery by which the nameless main character lived out his life all seemed quite authentic. I was genuinely intrigued by what Palahniuk had created and made a mental note to read more by this author.<br /><br />STRANGER THAN FICTION is a collection of articles written by Palahniuk for a variety of magazines. If you're fascinated by the \\"fight club\\" phenomenon, you'll find some satisfying glimpses into that story's little sojourn into Hollywoodland and the popular consciousness scattered among these articles. But even more so, STRANGER THAN FICTION offers glimpses into the absurdities, shallowness, and violence that constitute the end-of-the-millennium, life-in-America backdrop for that novel: the world of amateur wrestling (\\"Where Meat Comes From\\"), conferences where writers have seven minutes to pitch their stories to agents, publishers, or movie producers (\\"You Are Here\\"), a demolition derby in Washington State for combine drivers (\\"Demolition\\"), people obsessed with building medieval castles in the late 20th century U.S.A. (\\"Confessions in Stone\\"), users of steroids (\\"Frontiers\\"), the homoerotic nature of life on a submarine (\\"The People Can\\"), and an amateur rocket-maker seeking to win a ten million dollar prize being offered to the first private group to put a rocket into the atmosphere (\\"Human Error\\"). My favorite pieces, however, were the longer ones gathered in the \\"Portraits\\" section: actress Juliette Lewis (\\"In Her Own Words\\"), gay editor and political observer Andrew Sullivan (\\"Why Isn't He Budging?\\"), shock-artist Marilyn Manson (\\"Reading Yourself\\"), and Michelle Keating, a handler of rescue dogs (\\"Bodhisattvas\\"). What you get from Palahniuk consistently is a vision of people coping--one way or another, but coping nonetheless. And in an end-of-the millennium sort of way, this is the closest any of us is likely to get to hope. As Palahniuk says of himself in \\"Almost California\\", a self-mocking description of his visit to 20th Century Fox when FIGHT CLUB was in development, \\"That's why I write, because life never works except in retrospect. And writing makes you look back. Because you can't control life, at least you can control your version.\\"a handler of rescue dogs (\\"Bodhisattvas\\").

US	50086375	RA843IAKFHW03	1573223026	929884077	A Long Way Down	Books	5	3	7	N	Y	A great storyteller teaches a lot about storytelling	Hornby has a great knack for creating interesting characters who are a bit flawed and amazingly ill-equipped to face the challenges life throws their way. In A LONG WAY DOWN he gathers four such flawed people at the top of an office tower on New Year's Eve, each one having come there for different reasons but all with the same purpose--to commit suicide. Martin is a vacuous and dishonored TV personality (he just finished a short prison term for having sexual relations with a minor); Maureen, the mother of a severely disabled son; Jess, a spoiled and foul-mouthed daughter of the minister of education, whose sister went missing years ago; and JJ, an unsuccessful American rock musician whose band recently split up and whose girlfriend consequently left him.<br /><br />On the surface, Hornby seems to given himself a writer's workshop challenge: take four people who have absolutely nothing in common and intertwine their destinies. What he has created, though, seems very honest-a study of arbitrariness itself. That the reader ends up liking this collection of sad-sacks, whiners, blamers, and Teflon-coated losers is a miracle (though probably not a surprise to readers of ABOUT A BOY and HOW TO BE GOOD). And along the way, these oddball characters charm us with their wit (or bowl us over with their appalling lack of it). For instance, Jess observes of men like Martin, \\"They think women are like laptops...My old one is knackered and anyway, you can get ones that are slimmer and do more stuff now.\\" As a character-driven piece of fiction, this is a great read--fast-paced, and lots of fun.<br /><br />But I enjoyed it on another level as well. While I always avoid novels about writing novels, this one succeeds because none of the characters are writers, or even want to be writers. In fact, the characters are so wrapped up in their own narcissistic mishegoss that it's amazing that they ever have time to observe one another, let alone reflect on what is going on around them. And by making them non-writers, Hornby seems to be making a comparison between living and writing (not a new comparison, but cleverly drawn nonetheless). Naturally worked into the conversations, his characters reflect on the nature and power of storytelling, as well as on writerly subjects like point of view, similes and metaphors, causality, credibility, pretense, the plausibility and predictability of endings, the role of coincidence, metacommunication, tabloid prose, and reading as anti-social behavior. When Jess bluntly observes that \\"Everyone knows how to talk, and no one knows what to say,\\" she certainly seems to be speaking directly for Horby himself.  But in the end, it is perhaps Maureen, the most desperate of the quartet who speaks for Hornby most when she reflects on the reality of her mentally disabled son, Matty, \\"I only know one person in the world who doesn't need stories to keep himself going, and that person is Matty.\\" For her, and for each of the characters in the story (and by extension, for all of us), having a story and risking sharing it is the same as having a life and living it...even though no one can never know for sure how theirs will come out in the end.And by making them non-writers, Hornby seems to be making a comparison between living and writing (not a new comparison, but cleverly drawn nonetheless).

US	50086375	R2K5WVV1HT5DH3	0312272057	433455404	Dry: A Memoir	Books	5	4	6	N	Y	Running with shotglass	The second half of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS (affectionately known to AAers as \\"The Big Book\\") consists of a collection of life stories from people in recovery. They provide a different perspective on alcoholism and recovery than one gets from the program's \\"great white fathers,\\" Bill W. and Dr. Bob, whose life stories are integrated into the first part of the Big Book. Alcoholism knows no prejudice. It's an equal opportunity destroyer. It strikes women as well as men, the young and the old, all social classes and races. The stories in the Big Book make this clear. (It even includes the story of an American Indian, quite progressive, I thought, for 1955!) But it doesn't contain the story of any openly gay men or lesbians. Augusten Burroughs's DRY fills that gap.<br /><br />DRY picks up where his earlier volume of memoirs, RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, left off. Burroughs is brutally honest about himself and his shortcomings (in fact, you could say DRY is one long written 5th step). In fact, he's so honest with himself it's hard to believe he was ever able to muster up enough denial to keep his addiction going for so many years. But he admits in RWS to being an indefatigable journal keeper, so I guess he had notes to refer to once the alcoholic haze started to lift. Other reviewers have commented on Burroughs's dry wit, and the humor is definitely there. I found myself constantly putting little checkmarks in the margins next to bonmots I wanted to revisit (or steal and use at dinner sometime). For instance, \\"Alcohol time is very different from sober time. Alcohol time is slippery whereas sober time is like cat hair. You just can't get rid of it.\\" Anyone in recovery is apt to know exactly what he means. But if you can look beyond the surface humor, there is a painfully tragic reality to these kinds of observations. The humor makes the pain palatable for the reader--as it probably did for the author himself. But I would encourage readers to let themselves linger over some of the painful passages in DRY. Recovery is slow, illogical, messy, circuitous, boring, and unattractive at times. If you're gay and think you may have a problem with drugs and alcohol, Burroughs knows what you're going through--DRY may be just the book for you. If you're a gay person in recovery, Burroughs really keeps it green!<br /><br />If you spend a lot of time in the car or on the stairmaster, Burroughs has recorded the entire text of DRY onto CDs. He's a good reader of his own work, though it's a pretty straightforward, nondramatic reading. It's just hard to believe he lived to tell the tale.painful passages in DRY.

Hornby is one of the more generous and forgiving of these people. I don't get most of what he writes about music and consequently have been postponing reading his first novel HIGH FIDELITY (though I enjoyed the movie enough). The title of this collection of book reviews is Hornby's name for the group of editors at THE BELIEVER, the magazine in which they first appeared. It is a reference to a recording group known as The Polyphonic Spree. I've stalked them on the Web, heard some clips, and they remind me of the early Beatles mixed in with the Cowsills and the cast of Godspel (kinda groovy, ya know). I can imaging Horby hating them...or loving them. That's what I mean, you have to be into contemporary music to get where Hornby is much of the time. I suspect though that his editors don't feel flattered by this comparison.<br /><br />When he's talking about books, and people, and the human condition, I find him much easier to read. The POLYSYLLABIC SPREE is worth its purchase price just for his rabid defense of book-buying. Each month's review opens with two lists: the books he BOUGHT that month, and the books he READ. And he's definitely not a tourist in the land of Buying-and-Reading. His description of how one book leads you into another (a partial explanation to friends as to why he doesn't just read everything he owns before buying more), is right on the money. His love/hate relationship with \\"the little literary novel\\" is especially gratifying to be party to. Of one literary novel he abandoned mid-month, he writes, \\"I got halfway through before its quietness and lack of truth started to get me down. I don't mind nothing happening in a book, but nothing happening in a phony way--characters saying things people never say, doing jobs that don't fit, the whole works--is simply asking too much of a reader.\\" What's great about Horby as a reviewer is that he says things you always thought, but considered a little unfair and harsh. Hornby gives these harsh opinions credibility and weight. Coming from him, these opinions sound like confident Supreme Court decisions with no room for dissenting opinions. Even when he's writing about books I never intend to sign out of the library (let alone increase the size of my own by purchasing a copy), he has shrewd things to say about genres, marketing, pop culture, and the way we read.<br /><br />Another thing I like about THE POLYSYLLABIC SPREE is that it reads a bit like someone playing the academic game \\"Humiliation\\" in which literature professors go around the room and admit which major classic of Western Literature she or he has still not read and for which they are (presumably) truly ashamed (mine's REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST). For instance, Hornby admits to getting around to reading J.D. Salinger's slight corpus a little later in life than the usual Salinger fan. I guess when it comes to reading schedules and reading lists, \\"should\\" has always been the operative word. What we read and how much time we choose to set aside to have our world views challenged or coaxed along by complete (though hopefully, well-informed) strangers is, at its foundation, a moral matter. I like that Horby makes me think about this.y--characters saying things people never say, doing jobs that don't fit, the whole works--is simply asking too much of a reader.\\" What's great about Horby as a reviewer is that he says things you always thought, but considered a little unfair and harsh.

For one thing, I learned that although the idea of the lectionary (select readings for different Sundays in the church year) has ancient roots, the current 3-year cycle as expressed in the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL) and used by liturgical Protestant churches is a relatively recent invention. It is a Protestant response to changes that began with Vatican II in the mid-1960s. Ramshaw does a lot to explain the philosophy behind the selection of Old Testament lessons (which can complement the Gospel text or stand in stark contrast to it), the role of readings from the Epistles, why we stand to hear the Gospel text read, and why the Gospel of John doesn't get its own year the way the Synoptic Gospels do.<br /><br />Ramshaw has reflected deeply and written extensively on the lectionary and other matters germane to worship. She is a very well-informed and articulate layperson. This little book should be required reading for all people who assist at worship or who serve on the church's worship committee. It should be given to recently baptized adults and new members of any congregation that employs the RCL. It answers questions clearly and concisely that would otherwise take the person in the pews years to puzzle through on their own. Each chapter ends with a set of though-provoking questions, making this a wonderful tool for small group discussions. I highly recommend it.	2005-06-20

What I like about Gladwell is his sense of personal joy at exploring human phenomena. He challenges many assumptions made by the institutions of Western capitalism, but does this out of a genuine curiosity and a hunger to move beyond the obvious. He's never just a predictable debunker. As someone who has a professional interest in understanding what makes one style of marketing work and another flop, I found his examples from sales and marketing (Hush Puppies; the marketing of Rebecca Wells's \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\") especially helpful (though I was surprised the word \\"irony\\" did not appear anywhere in the discussion of the revival of ever-frumpy Hush Puppies shoe when it was on the verge of extinction). I found Gladwell's life-and-death examples (teen suicide in Micronesia and the failure in the US to combat an epidemic of teen smoking), less convincing and somewhat disturbing. Or perhaps, I merely found these examples disturbing because Gladwell doesn't really have a practical suggestion on how to reverse these trends. As the virus metaphor demonstrates, human intervention is often fruitless. With viruses, you sometimes just have to let them run their course. The paperback edition includes an appendix in which Gladwell discusses the even more disturbing case of Columbine-style high school shootings.	2005-06-17

I like that Gladwell drew his examples from a wide variety of professions and contexts: the world of marketing and advertising (the Pepsi challenge), the buying and exhibition of antique art (the Getty's purchase of a fraudulant kouros), political campaigning (Warren G. Harding and Bill Clinton), rock music (the not-easy-to-classify artist Kenna), hospital emergency triage work (Cook County Hospital's introduction of a simple diagnotic protocol to determine which chest pain patients were most likely to succumb to a full-blown heart attack), orchestra auditions (the increasing use of \\"blind\\" auditions to force judges to base their assessments solely on what they hear), and police work (the Rodney King and Amadou Diallo fiascos). He augments these ancedotal findings with more scientific studies (such as findings from an extensive breakdown and cataloguing of facial expressions and work with an autistic man). The snap decisions we make, called \\"thin slicing,\\" can help us make urgent, life-saving decisions, or can (under certain circumstances) guide us to make the most disastrous of choices. Gladwell seems to be fair in considering the pros and cons, but in the end his project seems mainly to be to inspire in us a sense of awe for the powerful gift we all have, one which ultimately eludes logical explanation.<br /><br />Great for the beach on long train ride.	2005-05-31
US	50086375	R14KENU03QMHVK	0806651083	795257217	Why Worship Matters	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	How to become a "fourth style" church	WHY WORSHIP MATTERS by Bishop Rimbo is a key volume in the new series \\"Worship Matters\\" put out by Lutheran (ELCA) publisher Augsburg Fortress. This is a series of short (under 100 pages each) but insightful examinations of important aspects of worship and liturgy (music, baptism, Holy Communion, the Lectionary, etc.). Rimbo's volume is a good starting point, because, after all, if one doesn't reflect on WHY one worships, the hows and wherefors don't matter much.<br /><br />This series is written primarily for Lutherans, but certain titles are likely to appeal to Episcopalians, and even to Evangelicals who are finding their tradition unsatisfying and unidimensional. WHY WORSHIP MATTERS is likely to have broad appeal because it forces readers to examine what they think is going on when they \\"go to church.\\" Rimbo quotes Diana Butler Bass's description of the four kinds of congregations that experience growth: (1) those that \\"embrace evangelicalism,\\" (2) those committed to becoming \\"user friendly\\" on the Willow Creek Community Church model, (3) those that adopt a psychotherapy or 12-Step style, and (4) those that are intentional about their mission. The fourth group does not represent one denominiation or theology, is neither liberal nor conservative, but is comprised of churches that are inventive in the way they blend local vision (confessional integrity) with Christian practice (liturgy, striving for justice, etc.). And it is this \\"fourth style\\" of being a church that Rimbo is clearly advocating for Lutherans.<br /><br />What I found especially appealing about Rimbo's take on church life, is his ability to uphold high standards (for music, the liturgy, the way we pass the peace, etc.), while also being generous and accepting of the way all Christians will inevitably fall short of these standards. \\"Things are never the way they _should_ be. But if we keep waiting for what _should_ be we'll miss what is real!\\" (p. 63). Another thing I appreciated is Rimbo's constant emphasis on the importance of community (both the church as a community of people who gather together to serve God and as a group of people who are not divorced from the larger communities they find themselves among.) \\"The kind of community to which the church is committed is not determined by territory, ideology, or fantasy. It is a place where each individual stands before God's judgment and mercy and where the well-being of the least dare not be ignored\\" (p. 51).<br /><br />Each section of the book concludes with a section of 1 to 5 questions \\"For reflection and discussion.\\" These are genuinely challenging questions and worth reflecting on. There are 25 such sections of questions. I could see an individual taking a month to reflect on these as part of his or her daily devotions; or a congregation working through them in small discussion groups over the course of 4 or 5 weeks. Rimbo certainly gives us a lot to chew on.

She went to the doctor to have a pimple examined and was persuaded to immediately check herself into one of New England's pretigious mental health hospitals...her doctor helpfully calling her a taxi. Her parents, shadowy figures throughout the book, seem to have offered no protest, and even happily paid the hospital bills. There's a lot to question here. Much later, she learns that her official diagnosis is borderline personality disorder...and treats us to the DSM-III definition of this disorder.<br /><br />What fascinated me about Kaynen's story is that it is very much the story of middle-class America at mid-century. The postwar mass compulsion to mime (or invent) normalcy was beginning to ring false. The forced buoyancy of the early 1960s was moving manically toward the disorder, madness, and assasinations that would make the year 1968 a turning point in American history (and therefore the history of the world). The culture at large was going through an identity crisis, experiencing its own large-scale borderline personality disorder: instability of self-image, uncertainty about life issues (sexual orientation, long-term goals, values), affective instability, impulsiveness, and even suicidal tendencies. Kaysen seems to be little more than an articulate symptom-bearer for this highly dysfunctional nation.<br /><br />These simple memoirs make for insightful supplementary reading for anyone who enjoys the great fiction chroniclers of American mid-century madness: Bellow, Mailer, Plath, Cheever, and Updike.<br /><br />The title of the book is borrowed from a Vermeer painting at New York's Frick Museum--Girl Interrupted at Her Music. Kaysen's is a thoughtful memoir and we can be happy that her music was only interrupted, never silenced.	2005-05-13

Nyswaner is so honest about his personal tragedies, disappointments, and shortcomings, it is hard to believe this self-awareness was so hard-won. He has the humble wisdom of someone who has managed to find grace in some of life's most graceless circumstances. His success as a film writer is back-story. How he as a small-town boy from a working class western Pennsylvania family achieved this success is not really explained. This is really the story of his descent into a personal hell of alcoholism, drug addiction, depression, self-loathing, and suicidal despair...and of his eventual recovery. If his recovery is not exactly phoenix-like, it will strike readers who have been through similar experiences as authentic. Nyswaner is, after all, an accomplished writer. He is no sloganeer or New Age spiritual salesman. His story ends not with blissful optimism, but on a note of cautious but grounded hope.<br /><br />At the heart of his life's story is his journey toward love. And key to what he learns about this powerful human experience is his relationship with a prostitute he knew as Johann. BLUE DAYS, BLACK NIGHTS begins with Nyswaner's account of Johann's funeral, so it is not \\"spoiling the plot\\" to say Johann dies tragically and prematurely and that his death is a pivotal moment in Nyswaner's journey. Nyswaner does not glamorize or vilify Johann's life as a prostitute, nor does he describe it in patronizing terms. It may be hard for some readers to believe that what Nyswaner felt for Johann could accurately be described as love. And it's clear that Nyswaner himself shares in such incredulousness. The biggest question Nyswaner seems to ask (and I believe successfully answers) is, Can love exist in relationships that are not completely honest? Nyswaner seems to be saying that imperfect love perfectly accessed opens a person's heart to deeper and more authentic levels of love. It is through facing the death and loss of Johann that Nyswaner is able to find the love he needs to care for his aging and dying parents and rebuild his damaged life.<br /><br />All this is to say, BLUE DAYS, BLACK NIGHTS has much to teach not just people who've been damaged by drugs and sex addiction, but also anyone who has ever failed to be completely honest with himself.

Told from the perspective of a woman doctor whose misanthropic husband suddenly stumbles across his own personal stash of holiness, coincidentally at the time the good doctor is engaging in a half-hearted love affair. The husband's newfound spirituality and concern for the poor sends Dr. Carr and the couple's two children into a bit of a tailspin. Everyone in the family must wrestle with what it means to be good (and to be \\"good enough). Like Voltaire's great satire, the puzzled heroine-narrator is forced to confront many of society's sacred cows (New Age spirituality, conventional charity, the Church, careerism, marital fidelity, the nuclear family, art, literature, and the role of pop culture).<br /><br />Hornby's ability to draw flawed but likeable characters infused with wit and humor (even the children) keeps this somewhat uneventful novel from ever becoming dull or pointless. In the end, I very much identified with Dr. Carr and her ambiguous feelings about everything she holds dear. Her questioning helped me question all my relatiionships--with family members, friends, significant others, my church, and my job. It's very much the kind of novel I want to pass on to a friend.	2005-03-15

In MAGICAL THINKING Burroughs dropped a lot of clues about his dysfunctional childhood, drugs & alcohol problems, indifference to education, obsessions with pop culture (and especially beauty culture), inappropriate sex partners, and crazy mother. What's not to identify with? I was intrigued, and when I picked up RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, I was halfway expecting to see my own reflection. But, that wasn't my experience. Behind the humor (one person's defense mechanism is another's survival tool!), is a portrait of a lost childhood and a sense of alienation that make's Holden Caulfield's look like a bellyache. From MAGICAL THINKING I know that Burroughs's story has a reasonably happy ending. (If not a happy ending, at least that he was eventually able to make more than Tom Collinses from the lemons life gave him.) Burroughs went through a lot (including being legally relinquished by his mother to the care of her dubiously qualified psychiatrist at age 13). While living in the psychiatrist's household he becomes the underage lover of his adopted brother (twice his age) and manages with the enabling help of his \\"shrink father\\" to scam the school system into letting him quit school before the legal age of 16. Burroughs was the archetypal at-risk youth, and it says a lot about our society that children can so easily fall off the radar screen. Read RUNNING WITH SCISSORS for the laughs, or read it as biting social commentary--but read it.	2005-02-26

He has the wit. He's a clever observer of contemporary mores. Add to this an ample supply of contempt for political correctness and a love for pushing the boundaries of taste. In the \\"true stories\\" that make up MAGICAL THINKING he manages to get away with virtual murder because half the time the target of his cutting satire is himself. Arranged somewhat chronologically, these stories read like outtakes from his memoirs RUNNING WITH SCISSORS. The collection begins with a story about his effort to achieve stardom at age seven when he was selected to be in a Tang commercial (\\"Commercial Break\\") and includes one about his studying to become a Barbizon model in his teens (\\"Model Behavior\\"). It includes frank stories about his dysfunctional family of origin, alcoholism, gayness, dating woes, relations with Catholic priests, boredom and frustration as an advertising copywriter, and even his \\"hygiene issues.\\" \\"Debby's Requirements,\\" one of my favorites in the collection, is a New York story about Burroughs' battle of wills with a domineering cleaning lady. In \\"The Rat/Thing\\" he takes the New York thing to extremes when he reveals what he will do to get rid of a rodent intruder. It's so extreme you can't help thinking he might be using his little domestic tempest in a teapot to describe something much larger--the obsessive Western mind (e.g., Bush v. Saddam). He both revels in and criticizes American obsession with celebrity culture and aspirational advertising. Shallowness (especially in gay men) is both scorned and celebrated. The collection ends on a slightly more reassuring note with several stories about a still-promising sounding relationship with a man named Dennis. I think we'll have to wait for the next collection of \\"true stories\\" to see how that one turns out.	2005-02-22

The lectures were given at the New York Public Library and the authors were permitted (encouraged?) to rework them for publication. Wasserstein's SLOTH and Robert Thurman's ANGER are the latest titles to join the series (ENVY and GLUTTONY were published in 2003; LUST and GREED in 2004; PRIDE is promised for this spring and hopefully will come before the fall).<br /><br />Although I've bought all of the available titles, I chose to read SLOTH first (always having had a soft spot for this sin). It is not surprising that Wasserstein, an accomplished playwright, chose to adopt a persona to convey her message-that of a sloth guru, the author of a anti-self-help book entitled \\"Sloth: And How to Get It.\\" The guru is so slothful s/he hasn't gotten around to forming a clear or specific sexual identity (At college, \\"I played sports on both men's and women's teams, and I had also danced the young male and female lead in the New York City Ballet's Nutcracker\\"; p. 19) Anyone who has tried all the new diet books, attended a 12-step group, guiltily read PEOPLE at the supermarket check-out line, or gotten caught up in church/synagogue, school, or office politics, will enjoy the many jabs Wasserstein delivers to institutions and champions advocating perfectability. SLOTH has the potential to become a modern satirical classic like C.S. Lewis's THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS or Ambrose Bierce's THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY. However, unlike Lewis's great work, the jokes are mostly superficial, univalent, and very repetitive. It is, in the end, a one-joke book, and you could certainly accuse Wasserstein of taking enough trope to hang herself.<br /><br />My disappointment (why I only gave this very funny book only four stars), is that Wasserstein only occassionally reveals a serious concern with the nature and history of her chosen \\"sin.\\" When I got to chapter three (\\"The Concise History of Sloth\\"), I thought that Wasserstein at last was going to start taking her subject seriously. And she does--for four pages (pp. 24 to 28), where she gives a very brief description of how \\"accedia\\" (originally understood as \\"sadness\\") was usurped in the seventeenth century by \\"sloth\\" on the Church's list of the Big Seven Sins. But wisdom can be found among the book's many flippancies. For instance, in her chapter on \\"Uberslothdom\\" she asserts, \\"True sloths are not revolutionaries...Sloths are the lazy guardians at the gate of the status quo\\" (p. 104).

It is philosophy for the rest of us. While introducing arguments from the likes of Jesus Christ, Rousseau, David Hume, Adam Smith, Ruskin, and Thoreau, he persuades with examples from art (novelists Austen and Flaubert; painters Thomas Jones, Christen Kobke, Hubert Robert...and the painters of \\"vanitas\\" images) and from pop culture (Punch and New Yorker cartoons and advertising images). If there is any consolation in the philosphy he presents, it is that status anxiety is universal (even ascetics and anti-materialist bohemians suffer from it) and seems to be hardwired into the human psyche. What he eventually affirms is that the spheres of philosophy, art, politics, religion, and bohemia have all provided (to varying degrees) moderately successful strategies for coping with the anxiety that comes with not feeling good enough in the eyes of our neighbors, colleagues, friends, and peers, and that each of these spheres has a way of recasting the definition of success so that those who might otherwise feel excluded or judged can affirm their self-worth and assert their own definitions of \\"success in life.\\"<br /><br />I especially appreciated his discussion of meritocracy (page 45-71). When, as a society, we accept without question the notion that all people have equal opportunities, it is easy to be smug when we succeed (acquire wealth and fame) and to become indifferent to the struggles of those who do not acquire these societal rewards. In a meritocracy it becomes almost essential to hold such \\"under-achievers\\" in contempt (as weak, stupid, dishonest, foolish, or lazy). In short, to label them as \\"losers.\\" Once labeled, it is easy to dismiss them altogether. This sense that our own merits are responsible for our success (and that luck and social location do not factor in) is the fuel for the status anxiety that seems to be rampant in Western culture today. I think I appreciated the chapter on meritocracy so much because American culture seems to take the existence of merit-based systems as evidence that democracy works. De Botton is the first author I have read who has identified this shadow side of American democracy and optimism. Although he doesn't lay out an exit strategy, de Botton at least exposes the problem.<br /><br />My favorite anecdote in STATUS ANXIETY comes from the chapter on philosophy (p. 111): \\"As Alexander the Great was passing through Corinth, he sought out Diogenes and finally found him sitting under a tree, dressed in rags, with not a drachma to his name. When the most powerful man in the world asked the philosopher if he could do anything to help him, Diogenes replied, \\"Yes, if you could step out of the way. You are blocking the sun.\\" The people hoarding all the status will forever be the targets of philosophers, artists, the authentically pious, radical politicians, cartoonists, and people from the bohemian counter-culture.<br /><br />My modest, three-star rating is due to the fact that status anxiety seems to be such a universal human experience, yet de Botton sadly excludes any arguments from non-Western traditions.

Nowhere on the cover or copyright page of this book does the publisher classify it as a novel...or as a work of philosophy, for that matter. I can't help thinking that this playful insouciance was probably at the insistance of the author. Alain de Botton has twice previously used a loose novelistic form to help readers engage with centuries-old philosophical ideas and dilemmas. His first, ON LOVE (US title), was nicely conceived and tightly executed; the second, KISS & TELL, had a darker, smarmier aspect since it included photographs of its young female subject and I couldn't shake the sense that I was peeking into someone dirty clothes basket without her consent.<br /><br />THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT is the most loosely assembled of the three novels (if, in fact, it is a novel). It follows a young woman's unexpected and unplanned journey into a romantic relationship (not her first) with a banker a few years her senior. Her name is Alice and the author clearly intends the reader to make connections to Lewis Carroll's young \\"adventurer.\\" Secondary characters are added and dropped as needed and the novel, were it not so unique and fun, might be deemed a failure if judged by conventional standards.<br /><br />The arc of the story follows the predictable flow of the young couple's relationship--courtship, sexual consumation, mutual testing, failed communications, unexpressed expectations, outside flirtations, and eventual devolution. Nothing unusual or dramatic here. What is riveting is the way Botton is able to use philosophy to examine these very ordinary experiences. I think readers will have no trouble identifying with most of the thought processes recounted here and attributed to one of the two main characters. The novel (again, if it is a novel) is loaded with \\"Ah-ha\\" moments.<br /><br />A rundown of some of the chapter titles will give you a sense of the range of issues Botton tackles: \\"Reality,\\" \\"Art and Life,\\" \\"Story Envy,\\" \\"In Love with Love,\\" \\"Sex, Shopping, and the Novel,\\" \\"Predictability,\\" \\"Power and 007,\\" \\"Religious Relationships,\\" \\"Diving, Rousseau and Thinking Too Much,\\" \\"Provincialism,\\" \\"Passing the Guilt,\\" and \\"Who Makes the Effort?\\" My favorite of his observations is from the chapter \\"Jollyism\\": \\"Gossip is an exercise in trust: a person feels free to gossip when they feel they have someone to understand their objections. It is a colluding activity; two people leave the main group and open their parcel of gossip material\\" (p. 205). Botton is happy to be our gossip partner and has many such parcels to open with us.

This \\"zero tolerance approach to punctuation\\" is a fun ride through the messups and missteps of others. Author Lynne Truss's basic premise is that punctuation matters. Rather than compiling hard and fast rules, she provides examples of where wrong (or no) punctuation causes confusion. And she's up-to-date in taking on email conventions like the excessive use of emoticons, dashes, and ellipses.<br /><br />This is probably of most use to people who already care about commas and colons, who enjoying seeing their pet peeves peeve others as well. People really trying to master grammar and punctuation might feel a little underserved.<br /><br />My favorite anecdote is Truss's description of a woman at a book signing who complained that she always wished she new how to punctuate and that someone would write a book that would show her how. I think we've all met this woman in one sphere of our lives or another. The willfully lost person who refuses to look at the map before them. Surely, she fits some Jungian archetype. Truss's book may not provide a comprehensive treatment of the subject, but she certainly goes out of her way to make the subject interesting even to the woefully ignorant.<br /><br />PS, The title is explained on the back cover.	2004-11-08

In \\"The Things You Know\\" he presents a pair of rival widows who continue their friendship in spite of what they know and resent about each other. In \\"The Revival\\" Barnes speculates on the late-life thoughts of the accomplished novelist, but failed playwright, Ivan Turgenev. In \\"Vigilance\\" he slowly reveals the key to the deep remorse (rage?) of a curmudgeony gay man with a personal mission to suppress (or evict) coughers at concert recitals. The scenarios in these eleven stories are diverse, and the characters' dilemmas and their responses to those dilemmas are plausible. It is uncanny that Barnes (who presumably wrote these stories in his early and mid fifties) can project himself so easily forward into old age. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't find these reflections morbid. I find each of his aged characters to have some sort of enobling characteristic. Often, they seem to have an amazing ability to continue to negotiate with life, as when the wife in \\"Appetite\\" discovers that she can get some spark of life from her senile (Alzheimer stricken?) husband by reading to him from cook books, in spite of his failing mental abilities and his propensity to break out in obscene ramblings.<br /><br />Perhaps my personal favorite in the collection is \\"Knowing French,\\" which consists of putative correspondence to the author from Sylvia Winstanley, an inmate in an \\"old folkery.\\" It would be easy to enjoy this story for its surface charm, the vanity of an old woman trying to impress a published author, who tosses off French phrases while misspelling simple English words. But the fact that this is one-sided communication gives their progression an eerie quality. It makes one wonder (in an existential sort of way), if our own understanding of our life is enough. Can a life's meaning be discerned by one person's version? The story concludes with two letters to the author from the old folkery's warden, in which he twice calls her \\"the life and soul of the party,\\" a far cry from her self-perception as a misunderstood and under-appreciated trouble-maker. It is in touches and turns like this that make Barnes's stories so rich and worth reading (and re-reading).ory concludes with two letters to the author from the old folkery's warden, in which he twice calls her \\"the life and soul of the party,\\" a far cry from her self-perception as a misunderstood and under-appreciated trouble-maker.

These lectures from the late 1970s are still fresh and insightful. And they are as much an exploration of what it means to interpret a literary work as they are an examination of the Evangelist's text and methods. To do so he takes side-trips into Shakespeare, Joyce, Kafka, as well as into a little-known novel by Henry Green (&quot;Party Going&quot;). These are not idle excursions; Kermode's lectures are eloquent and tightly reasoned. In the end, his position is philosophical rather than aesthetic for he asserts that to live is to interpret. &quot;We glimpse the secrecy through the meshes of the text; this is divination, but what is divined is what is visible from our angle.... When we come to relate [the] part to the whole, the divined glimmer to the fire we suppose to be its source, we see why Hermes is the patron of so many other trades besides interpretation. There has to be trickery. And we interpret always as transients--of whom he is also patron--both in the book and in the world which resembles the book. For the world is our beloved codex.&quot; And like all good philosphical writing, Kermode's lectures are worth studying closely and reading over and over again.	2004-07-09

A few things come off very nicely in Kermode's &quot;The Age of Shakespeare.&quot; What it lacks in detailed analysis of Shakespeare's poetry and dramaturgy, it makes up for by providing a sense of Shakespeare's time, the growth of theater in the 16th and 17th centuries (thanks, in part, to Mr. Shakespeare himself), and the many ways Shakespeare adapted his craft to suit evolving sensibilities. For the first time I appreciated Shakespeare as a business-person who used everything at his disposal in order to succeed at his chosen profession (or, at least, the one he ended up practicing after failing to find reliable patronage as a professional poet).<br />It is apt that this book is part of Modern Libary's Chronicle Book series, as chronolgoy is key here. Although scholars don't always know the exact sequence in which the plays were written, there seems to be enough of a consensus that Kermode can make some useful observations and generalizations. For instance, plays that were written for the Globe, a large outdoor theater, are different in some noticeable ways from the late Romance plays produced for the more intimate setting of the Blackfriars theater (with its higher-priced tickets that necessarily excluded groundlings). Such claims, of course, need to be tested by a careful rereading of the plays--in chronilogical order, rather than by genre or broad categories.<br />One warning, there are no plot summaries here. You pretty much need to be familiar with Shakespeare's plays in order to follow Kermode's arguments.<br />The book includes a brief &quot;Bibliographical Note&quot; to direct readers to other reliable resources on various aspects of life, religion, art, and theater in Shakespeare's time.	2004-06-09

The events take place in a single afternoon at the home of an American woman in France between the First and Second World Wars. The narrator, Alwyn Tower, and his hostess, Alexandra Henry, are visited by the Cullens, a middle-aged Irish couple. Mrs. Cullen has brought along her pet hawk Lucy whose presence dominates the remainder of the story (both symbolically and as another character). With its hood on, the hawk seems to represent the blindness of a class of wealthy internationals who live for food and fun, and who have made an uneasy peace with their captivity and lack of freedom.<br />Meanwhile, a trio of servants (Jean and Eva, the cooks; and Ricketts, the Cullens' chauffeur) plays yang to the aristocats' yin. For them, flirtation, jealousy, and passion are the defining mainstays of their existence. And they don't even need to turn to alcohol to release these life forces.<br />It's hard to know how seriously we are to take the narrator, a novelist twice failed in love. He is an astute observer and chronicler of the events, but his self-acknowledged failures as a writer certainly seem to justify the uncomfortable feelings he has toward Mrs. Cullen's captive carnivore. Although we know from page one that the Americans Alexandra and Alwyn would eventually return to America when tensions increase in Europe, at the novel's end it seems somewhat doubtful that either one will ever muster the energy needed to leave their perches in Alexandra's parlor.<br />This short novel has some of the biting class insights of Saki's better stories. Other than that, I find it hard to compare this book to any other I have ever read. Interesting in spite of and because of its brevity. Worth reading and rereading.	2004-06-08

Each man reflects independently on a brief reading from the Torah which they have studied together. This is not a call-and-response presentation. On some lessons, the men make similar observations. More often, however, they seem to approach the exact same texts from wildly different perspectives. If you're the kind of person who believes the Bible is a vital, living, ever-transforming thing, this is profoundly encouraging. The Bible is as fresh as the minds that open themselves to it. They are a deep well; it is impossible to drain these sacred texts dry.<br />The cities of refuge in the book of Numbers were those cities where people suspected of violent crimes could flee to be protected from the blood vengeance of the family and clan members of one's victims. The citizens of these towns guaranteed your safety until your case could be carefully deliberated by wiser and cooler heads. According to Numbers, there were to be six of these cities within the territory of Israel. For the authors, the five &quot;cities&quot; of refuge are the five books of the Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). In these five masterworks, students can experience the patience and loving kindness of the Creator while reflecting on their blessings, mistakes, desires, and shortcomings. Safety, the authors seem to be saying, is a necessary prerequisite to exploring the fullness of God's mind and human potential. As Mamet says in his final contribution to this volume, &quot;The 'struggle with the angel,' Judaism's struggle, is this: not that we will wrest more information from him--we will not--but that we learn to live with the information we possess--to cease seeking information and to pursue wisdom.&quot;<br />Some readers may find these devotions to be too slight (most are only one page long), but I found a slow careful reading of a single biblical text and Kushner's and Mamet's reflections on that text to be a great way to start the day.

I really appreciated this (very) short introduction to the Koran. As a Christian who is fairly familiar with my own tradition's sacred book, the Bible, I found it helpful in explaining how the Koran and Bible are different. The books that make up the Bible were written over many centuries, the Koran was written and compiled in less than a century (and five centuries after the latest book in the New Testament). Most Jews and Christians read their Bibles in a translation (leaving it to their biblical scholars to learn the original languages); the Koran is read and recited exclusively in its original Arabic, even in countries where Arabic is not a native language (Iran, Malaysia). The Bible contains many types of literature--poetry, wisdom sayings, compelling narratives, prophetic utterances; the Koran refers to events and stories (including some, like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, from the Jewish and Christian Scriptures) but has no narratives of its own (not even the story of its primary prophet, Muhammad) and consists only of prophetic utterances. The Bible is quite long; the Koran is relatively short and some Muslims have memorized it in its entirety. The Bible plays a significant role in the liturgy of Jews and Christians; public reading of the Koran is not part of Islamic public worship.<br />However, like the Hebrew Bible with its Midrashim and Talmud, and New Testament with the writings of the church fathers, the Koran has gathered around itself a enormous body of commentaries to help explain its difficult and contradicory texts. Many Islamic beliefs that are attributed to the Koran are actually based on the commentaries of its interpreters.<br />I liked this book because it focused solely on the Koran itself. Most books I've picked up on Islam don't give this much attention to the Koran, or only refer to it intermittently. For a &quot;very short introduction&quot; there's a lot here to digest.<br />The photos and illustrations are interesting and instructive. The book also includes a short chapter on reading Arabic transliteration, an annotated bibliography, and an index.book also includes a short chapter on reading Arabic transliteration, an annotated bibliography, and an index.	2004-05-03

In fact, I suspect many American literary critics fail to place the necessary emphasis on European models (Strindberg, Ibsen, and Georg Kaiser). Horst Frenz helped me, for the first time, to appreciate O'Neill's love-hate relationship with the commercialism and mediocrity of American theater in the era immediately preceding the one he transformed. (Clearly his father's bitterness at being a successful actor who was unchallenged by the roles available to him created a profound wariness in his son.)<br />Also to be appreciated is the way Horst keeps biographical details to a minimum (just enough to help the reader get a handle on the wide range plays O'Neill turned out). I felt I got the overview I desired from this brief introduction to the playwright. If I was left wanting more, it was more clarification on how O'Neill related to (and influenced) his contemporary playwrights, especially Tennessee Williams. But overall, the book's brevity is its clearest asset.	2004-04-09

Even at the combined length of just over 1,000 pages, THE MANUAL is a manageable reference work, no more cumbersome than a standard collegiate dictionary.<br />Although, as an American, I will continue to use the CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE as my arbiter for editorial decisions, I find Oxford's manual an excellent way of distinguishing between British and American styles of English; Part II (the dictionary) is especially thorough in pointing out key differences. Also, beginning on page 244 in Part I is a list of about 500 everyday American words with their British equivalents (tick-tack-toe = noughts and crosses). Although it would be nice to have the same list in reverse (an American's undershirt is a &quot;vest&quot; in UK, and his vest is a &quot;waistcoat&quot;, something that is not immediately clear from the way the list is put together), the list is short enough for anyone to read through and become familiar with. (The CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE has no equivalent list.)<br />In short, a good and thorough resource.	2004-03-26

I've always been a fan of the TANAKH Translation of the Hebrew Bible (aka Old Testament), but have been unable to find a volume that had study notes for the entire translation. The Jewish Publication Society (copyright holder of the TANAKH) has nice Commentaries on the individual books of the Torah (plus Jonah and Esther), but these cover only the books mentioned and are too unwieldy for everyday use.<br />Oxford Univ. Press has produced a great single-volume work that is beautifully typeset and easy to read. Each book has an engaging introduction and helpful sidebar notes and commentary provided by reputable Jewish scholars. These notes are organized as thought units, not as random facts and definitions. Although the TANAKH does not break down the text into subunits with section heads, the scholars providing the notes do this in a non-obtrusive manner. I find this to be a very respectful way to treat the Scripture text. (Many Christian study Bibles intrude upon the text in such a willy-nilly manner it can be hard for even a serious Bible-reader to know where the Scripture ends and the &quot;commentating&quot; has begun.)<br />The volume concludes with 200-pages worth of essays: 7 on Jewish interpretation of the Bible; 8 on the Bible in Jewish life and thought; and 9 on backgrounds for reading the Bible (some of which are adaptations of essays found in Oxford's Annotated Bible). Like most study Bibles, the Jewish Study Bible has a timeline to help the reader get an approximate sense of when key biblical events occurred. What's nice about the JSB is that it also has a Chronological Table of Rulers listing rulers not directly referenced in the Bible; this helps the reader better place those that are. The 20-page glossary covers literary and theological terms (casuistic law, etiology, haplography, Oral Torah, etc.) as well as key names and terms from the biblical text.<br />As for &quot;chutzpah&quot;...this can be found in the commentator's note on Isaiah 44.9-13: &quot;God rebukes [the people] for their chutzpah in questioning the means through whom God chose to work.&quot; I offer this as evidence that the authors do not confine themselves to dry, esoteric scholarly ways of expression.ot;God rebukes [the people] for their chutzpah in questioning the means through whom God chose to work.&quot; I offer this as evidence that the authors do not confine themselves to dry, esoteric scholarly ways of expression.	2004-02-16

Butter	While some may take this to be a one-joke book (wooing an international tourist economy by recreating all of England's most famous, market-tested landmarks into a more manageable, mini-England on the Isle of Wight), I find it to be a clever lens through which the reader can observe and consider the foibles of modern Western (not just British) society. On the way it raises many interesting questions: What is the role of memory in personal and national identities? Why and how do we seek to exercise control over others? How are we shaped by the roles we assume (regardless of our motives for accepting these roles)? When is what we choose to believe about reality more powerful than reality itself? And let's not forget, What is the role of sex in history?<br />While this book by Julian Barnes does not have any of the understated poignancy that I enjoyed and expected to find after reading FLAUBERT'S PARROT, it is clever and engaging in its own way.

If you are at all intrigued by industrial architecture in general or grandiose visions of Victorian self-importance, you will enjoy this book. The photographs, technical drawings, and archival images in this &quot;English Heritage&quot; guide are exquisite and a joy to study. Manchester's first warehouses were built when the canals connected this city to the port city of Liverpool to the west; and they multiplied and morphed with the advent of the railroads. As Manchester became a key commercial center, these utilitarian buildings became a fascinating blend of functionality and ornament. Their public faces and ground floor showrooms were designed to impress and charm clients, while the upper floors, loading bays, and hydralic systems served the functional needs of moving, storing, and compressing wares (powerful compressors were used to expel excess air from bales of cloth).<br />By the late 1920s the textile industry had dispersed and many of the old warehouses fell into disuse. Manchester has done much to repurpose these solid old buildings--into hotels, office space, and residences, for instance. As the authors conclude, &quot;The challenge for Manchester, as with all cities, is to continue to [make] careful and informed decisions about these buildings, recognising and giving weight to their individual importance and the contribution they make to the wider cityscape.&quot;	2004-01-05

LeSueur is neither vindictive nor pointlessly benign. He truly understood and appreciated O'Hara's central position in the explosion of art that was happening in New York in the 50s and 60s. Unlike Ginsberg and the Beat poets, O'Hara was equally at ease among literary folk, musicians, and painters (especially the abstract expressionists). To read about O'Hara is to read about the greatness of post-war New York.<br />DIGRESSIONS is actually helpful, too. Because O'Hara often adopted a casual, off-hand, personal approach when writing his poems, it is great to have someone who was intimate with the poet to explain \\"who's who\\" and \\"what's what.\\" LeSueur, however, is equally comfortable admitting when he's baffled by an O'Hara reference, and explanations (and reminiscences) are never forced.<br />One other thing--DIGRESSIONS is an enlightening portrait of gay life in New York prior to the Stonewall riots. O'Hara and LeSueur were both openly gay, though they had quite different approaches to meeting their sexual needs. O'Hara seems to have had fewer partners, usually choosing them from his circle of friends and aquaintances. LeSueur seemed to favor one-night stands and casual sex. Perhaps this difference is one reason  their friendship continued long after their sexual intimacy ended. If only LeSueur had lived long enough to write DIGRESSIONS ON GAY LIFE BEFORE STONEWALL.	2003-12-18

It is the first (but certainly won't be the last) book I've read by Barnes. Although the story putatively deals with an aging scholar's research into (and physical search for) Loulou, a parrot mentioned in Flaubert's &quot;Un coeur simple,&quot; it covers much larger issues--the relationship of art and life, the dubious nature of literary legacies, the value and role of medicine, the status of women, the importance (or lack of: discuss) marital fidelity. Barnes certainly has a great love and deep knowledge of French literature, but the writing style he adopted for this novel reminds me more of James Joyce's Ulysses with each chapter employing a different literary genre while cleverly linking across chapters to other key thoughts and themes. Its comparative brevity (just over 200 pages), however, makes it easier for the (committed) reader to master and enjoy than Joyce's masterpiece. There's a lot here to explore and think about, and the more effort readers put into it the more they'll get out of it. On my first read through, I mostly enjoyed the Flaubert trivia; upon rereading I plan to pay closer attention to the doctor/scholar-narrator in order to discover more clues about his burdens, motives, and obsessions.<br />Although it probably helps to have read a lot of Flaubert before diving into this novel, I think the only book the reader really needs to be familiar with is &quot;Madame Bovary.&quot;	2003-11-28

I've always been turned off by the flippancy of certain popular paperbacks that purport to explain the basics of a variety of topics. By padding their discussions with low-brow humor and patronizing detail, they end up being two or three times longer than they need to be. The Oxford VSI books, however, take both the reader's interest and time constraints seriously.<br />This VSI on the Bible, for instance, approaches its subject from a variety of angles (not just how the Bible came about over thousands of years, but how it has been interpreted by both people of faith and by Western culture at large). And the brevity of the text does not prevent the author from presenting some amazing ironies--like how the same book that has been used to oppress others (as Europe colonized and missionized the world) has served to give voice to those seeking to extricate themselves from the effects of colonialization. Two of the earlier chapters, &quot;How the Bible Was Written&quot; and &quot;The Making of the Bible,&quot; do an amazing job of explaining the basics about how the Bible came about, what exactly is &quot;the canon,&quot; and how and why one biblical voice differs from others (sometimes even within the same book of the Bible). The discussion is sane, balanced, and scholarly. Even people who have no interest in reading the Bible as a document of faith will have trouble disputing any of Riches's observations about this classic of Western literature. Well done, OUP!	2003-11-09

This is a personal essay, not a Gay Lit 101 textbook. Consequently, some major gay American writers are not included: David Leavitt, Christopher Bram, Edmund White, Christopher Isherwood, Tennessee Williams, Carson McCullers, Truman Capote. Lesbian representation is slight--just Emily Dickinson (near queer, at that), Jane Bowles, and Gertrude Stein. And one slot was taken up by a writer who isn't even American (Oscar Wilde).<br />What's nice about Whitaker's writing, though, is that it is disciplined and thoughtful. He allows us glimpses of himself (it is safe to assume that part of his disdain for Gore Vidal, the man, derives from Whitaker's own experiences as a prostitute serving aloof, self-important clients as described in his memoir ASSUMING THE POSITION). But this authorial intrusiveness is occassional, is refreshingly honest and forthright, and never veers into self-indulgence.<br />While I might quibble with some of his assessments (Is Andrew Holleran's DANCER FROM THE DANCE really the generational equivalent of Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY?), quibbling is half the fun of reading literary criticism. I share his high regard for O'Hara, was glad to learn a little about Gertrude Stein as a writer (most critics usually write about her as a mentor to other writers), and am intrigued enough by his discussions of Glenway Wescott, Bowles, David Wojnarowicz, and Henri Cole to seek out copies of their works.<br />No explanation is given of the captionless photographs by Iannis Delatolas that illustrate this volume. In some cases their subject is obvious (one is of Frank O'Hara's grave, others are of living writers, such as John Ashberry), in other cases their subjects evoke the characters and settings these gay authors wrote about. Whatever their purpose, they're a nice addition.<br />Whitaker has produced another interesting book on gay culture and lifestlye.

But behind the humor, I suspect, is a deep well of pain. Sedaris is a gay author who writes about things other than being gay; and when he writes of his own homosexuality, it is always without any fanfare. In fact, the unifying theme of these stories seems to be the pain of being \\"odd\\" or an outsider. In some cases, Sedaris's outsider status can be clearly linked to his being gay (as in the opening story, \\"Go Carolina,\\" which describes the ordeal of being one of several sensitive boys in his school who is singled out for speech therapy for their lisps and effeminate speaking patterns). Elsewhere, his outsider status is due to being a northerner who moved to North Carolina, or an American who spends summers in France. On top of this, just being a member of his family seems to automatically qualify him for instant alien and mutant status. In fact, because of this many of his stories reminded me of souped up (some may say \\"vulgarized\\") versions of James Thurber's classic stories of his eccentric Ohio relatives. In fact, one story about his struggle to give up drinking, \\"The Late Show,\\" reminded me of \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.\\" As Sedaris struggles to make it through painful nights of insomnia he fashions a variety of outlandish identities for himself. While exagerated humor is a constant in Sedaris's stories, there is always something else present just below the surface that almost anyone can identify with. In flaunting his eccentricities and outsider status, Sedaris has presented himself as a universal type, a true everyman.	2003-08-13

In its place we have argued for a dual reading of those texts, a reading that reflects God's preservation of both the Jewish people and the Christian church as bearers of Israel's story into the future\\" (p. 131).<br />He builds his argument on Jewish and Christian understandings of the aqedah, the Binding of Isaac, and concludes his volume with fresh readings of the stories of Sarah's appeal to Abraham to expel Hagar and Ishmael (Genesis 21); Esau's discovery that he has been robbed of his blessing (Genesis 27); and the New Testament story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15).<br />Nowhere does van Buren argue for political correctness. In fact, as he presented his reasons for mutually respectful Jewish and Christian readings of the same texts I kept wondering why Christians hadn't taken this position earlier (and I mean centuries earlier). I suspect some Christians will be less convinced. But as for me, my reading of the Old Testament has changed forever.	2003-07-30

Although these are not brand new translations and all are readily available in other collections, the easy-to-read double column textbook format, the thematic way the texts are categorized, and the brief, helpful introductions make this anthology well worth its price. This volume and Ehrmann's other anthology THE NEW TESTAMENT AND OTHER EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITINGS are essential companions to his THE NEW TESTAMENT: A HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION TO THE EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITINGS.<br />On the frustrating side, there is much overlap between Ehrmann's two anthologies--in fact, I ended up buying them both because it was too much trouble to compare the tables of contents to see which volume included more non-New Testament works. Also somewhat disappointing was the fact that there are no bibliographic references to the supplied texts (each chapter introduction concludes with a short list of general topic books &quot;For Further Reading&quot;). I would, at least, like to know if there are other respected translations or commentaries in print on any of these texts. Another oddity: The Didache is split into three parts and presented out of sequence (with the document's brief chapter 6 being omitted altogether). This is not inappropriate, considering that Ehrmann has arranged his texts topically so readers can read significant key documents in relation to one another (such as, The Structure of Early Christianity [Did ch 11-15]; The Development of the Liturgy [Did 7-10]; Leading the Upright Life [Did 1-5]).<br />This is a nice, handy collection of key texts that I'm sure I'll return to over and over, especially as I read other books about the beginnings of the early Church.	2003-07-26

I can't overpraise this study Bible. Like its key rivals in the academic market, The Harper Collins Study Bible (HCSB) and The New Oxford Annotated Bible (NOAB), it uses the New Revised Standard Version as its text base (a good, responsible, and fairly literal translation of the full biblical canon--the 66 Old and New Testament books all Christian traditions use, plus 16 deuterocanonical/apocryphal books used in the Roman Catholic and/or Eastern Orthodox traditions). Also like its competitors, it has excellent scholarly introductions to each book, extensive explanatory notes, background articles, and maps.<br />So why, if you already own a good NRSV reference Bible, do you also need to get this one? Because the book introductions are incredibly fresh and up-to-date. Because the study notes are insightful and well-phrased. And because, unlike the HCSB and the NOAB, the New Interpreters' Study Bible has two additional kinds of notes. From time to time, the NISB inserts a &quot;Special Note&quot; among the footnotes that makes an interesting observation on the text to help the reader appreciate the larger issues at play within the Bible as a whole. For instance, at 1 Samuel 2.9 there is a special note that calls attention to two distinct points of view in the Bible about justice/theodicy. These special notes are more information than the reader needs to understand the particular passage at hand (and as such can be easily skipped over because they are slightly indented and set off from the surrounding, more text-specific notes), but they are like little windows opening onto a much wider world...and should not be overlooked. In addition, there are almost 100 brief Excurses on thought-provoking topics like &quot;Sibling Rivalry in Genesis,&quot; &quot;Interpretations of Rahab,&quot; &quot;Suicide,&quot; &quot;Anti-Semitic Interpretations of Isaiah,&quot; &quot;The Influence of the Maccabean Martyrs,&quot; and &quot;Responsibility for the Death of Jesus.&quot; And the editors had the foresight to provide an alphabetical listing of these excurses, knowing that readers were going to want to come back to them from time to time.<br />The essays included in the NISB mostly focus, as one would expect, on interpretive matters: &quot;The Reliability of Scripture,&quot; &quot;The Authority of the Bible,&quot; &quot;The Inspiration of Scripture,&quot; &quot;Guidelines for Reading and Interpretation,&quot; &quot;Varieties of Readings and Interpretations of the Biblical Text,&quot; and &quot;Culture and Religion Among the Ancient Israelities.&quot; The glossary is mostly a list of literary and theological terms (anthropomorphism, chiasm, theophany), but does include a few typical &quot;Bible terms&quot; that the reader may not find satisfying definitions for in a standard collegiate dictionary(such as, sackcloth, Gentile, Sheol).<br />If you're a reference book addict like me, the NISB promises countless hours of pleasurable reading and exploring.ors had the foresight to provide an alphabetical listing of these excurses, knowing that readers were going to want to come back to them from time to time.<br />The essays included in the NISB mostly focus, as one would expect, on interpretive matters: &quot;The Reliability of Scripture,&quot; &quot;The Authority of the Bible,&quot; &quot;The Inspiration of Scripture,&quot; &quot;Guidelines for Reading and Interpretation,&quot; &quot;Varieties of Readings and Interpretations of the Biblical Text,&quot; and &quot;Culture and Religion Among the Ancient Israelities.&quot; The glossary is mostly a list of literary and theological terms (anthropomorphism, chiasm, theophany), but does include a few typical &quot;Bible terms&quot; that the reader may not find satisfying definitions for in a standard collegiate dictionary(such as, sackcloth, Gentile, Sheol).<br />If you're a reference book addict like me, the NISB promises countless hours of pleasurable reading and exploring.	2003-07-19

The most fascinating parts of Epstein's book are his accounts of how he did something a little differently (&quot;thought outside the box,&quot; to use a current cliche) and helped create something truly innovative and worthwhile--like quality paperbacks (Anchor Books) and the Library of America (uniform editions of carefully edited American classics on acid-free paper). While this book is essentially an extended essay on where publishing is going (as publishing houses become lesser components in larger media companies, and author advances for the turner-outers of blockbuster titles sap publishers of their resources and makes them unwilling to take risks on more significant literary voices), there are some interesting portraits of key figures from publishing's past, such as Horace Liveright, Bennett Cerf, and Donald Klopfer.<br />His key thesis, that the future of publishing lay in being able to obtain printed books on demand from ATM-like kiosks, is both hopeful and scary. It means that there will be no need for any title to ever go out of print, no matter how limited its audience. (Hopeful.) But will books produced in this manner be as satisfying to read, hold, and collect as any single title in the Library of America? (Scary.)	2003-05-26

I haven't picked up a volume yet which disappointed me. But Carol Bechtel's commentary on ESTHER really goes the extra mile. It's chock full of fresh perspectives well stated. (Although she borrows many of these insights from the recently published commentaries of Adele Berlin and Jon Levenson, she is quick to credit her sources. And she is very selective about what she restates.)<br />The commentary is directed primarily to Christians, and to Protestants specifically. She raises an interesting point that Christians who \\"get their Scripture\\" solely from the lessons that are read aloud as part of Sunday services, are only exposed to a reading from Esther once every three years: Esther 7:1-6,9-10; 9:20-22. This clearly is not the best way to experience a book of the Bible that is a cleverly constructed \\"novella\\" with exciting characters, court intrigues, and dizzying plot reversals. She encourages Christians to imitate Jews by reading the book repeatedly, aloud, and in its entirety. As Bechtel points out, \\"It is a book, after all, about the struggle to be faithful in the midst of an increasingly unfaithful culture. It is a story of courage, faith, and deliverance. It is the story of men and women working together with a God who is not always obvious, but who is always gracious.\\"<br />To use this commentary most effectively, you need to have a copy of the New Revised Standard Version Bible (preferrably with the Apocrypal/Deuterocanonical books) since the biblical text is not printed in the commentary. You do not need any knowledge of Hebrew (or Greek), however. Where an understanding of the Hebrew is essential, Bechtel provides clear explanations. One example, her explanation of how the Hebrew words for \\"enslavement\\" and \\"destruction\\" are homophones, serves as a very plausible explanation of why the King could have been so easily duped into signing a death warrant for the Jewish people.<br />Although Bechtel presents the shorter, Hebrew version of Esther as the \\"best text,\\" she does examine the Additions to Esther (those passages that are found only in the Greek and Latin versions of the text) in a brief Appendix.ed into signing a death warrant for the Jewish people.<br />Although Bechtel presents the shorter, Hebrew version of Esther as the \\"best text,\\" she does examine the Additions to Esther (those passages that are found only in the Greek and Latin versions of the text) in a brief Appendix.	2003-03-02

As Freedman acknowledges in his Preface, this book is the written version of three talks given at the University of Michigan in 1988. As lectures, they are little more than a sketch of the elements that distinguish the three main sections of the Hebrew Bible: The Primary History (Torah and the Former Prophets), The Latter Prophets, and The Writings. He spends a fair amount of time looking at the symetry of the Hebrew canon and comparing the word counts of the Bible's different components. Freedman later expanded his discussion on the Decalogue found in the lecture on the Primary History into a full book called THE NINE COMMANDMENTS (I recommend it highly). I found the chapter on The Writings to be especially interesting. Freedman sees strong connections between Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah (where David, Jerusalem, and the Temple are idealized) and the Psalms and Wisdom literature (usually attributed to David's heir Solomon). It is also, only in The Writings that King Cyrus of Persia is mentioned. There's lots here to think about, whether you buy all of Freedman's arguments or not. And after so many years of scholarly efforts to parse the Bible into bits and pieces, it's nice to see someone who is willing to stand back a bit and look at the canon as a whole.	2003-03-02
US	50086375	R2S7TLLNOA265J	0312305060	785940945	The Hours	Books	3	5	5	N	Y	Benign and overly crafted	I have never struggled less reading a modern literary novel. It was virtually a page-turner. Although I didn't identify with any of the main characters--the ficitionalized Virginia Woolf who we meet at the point in her career when she is writing MRS. DALLOWAY; Laura Brown, a young mother living in post-WWII America who makes lousy birthday cakes, harbors lesbian tendencies, and wishes only to stay in bed and read MRS. DALLOWAY all day; and Clarissa Vaughn, a present-day lesbian mother and editor who is the primary caregiver to a male poet dying from AIDS and whom the poets refers to as MRS. DALLOWAY--I didn't despise them either. The patient reader will discover that it is more than the fictional Mrs. Dalloway that connects the book's three protagonists whose lives span three generations, but to say more about this would undermine one of the book's few surprises.<br />Cunningham's prose is flawless and narcotizing. Mercifully, he does not attempt to give us stream of consciousness writing. Observations and descriptions (even about things like flowers) are never decorative and gratuitous. Shifts in points of view are subtle, but always well signalled. The reader should never doubt that Cunningham is in control of his story. (If Cunningham is embodied in any one of his characters, I suspect it is the outward-oriented, ever-busy, and always in control Clarissa Vaughn.) What I find puzzling after finishing the book is how such a well-made book can be so emotionally unimpressive. Although the book culminates around a single dramatic event and the three separate strands of the narrative are drawn together, there doesn't seem to be much of a point. (The movie made from this novel seems to have stuggled with the same issue and responded by adding an improbable closing speech for an elderly Laura Brown.) Perhaps there is no point and Cunningham is making a coy play at being postmodern; or perhaps the point is that all of us--famous authors, disenchanted 50s housewives, or modern activist types--struggle with the same banal unraveling of the hours that make up our alotted time on earth. Karma is a big cosmic joke and our own pathetic lives are the punch line.<br />Amusing detail: Meryl Streep who plays Clarissa Vaughn in the movie is mentioned in passing in an early chapter of the novel.dern activist types--struggle with the same banal unraveling of the hours that make up our alotted time on earth.

The text is thin and doesn't really say anthing new. The paintings are also likely to be familiar to anyone who has studied Eakins and have been frequently reproduced in more comprehensive catalogs. Even the photographs, called \\"Naked Series\\" because they show a single nude model from multiple angles, have been reproduced previously. Dating from the 1880s these may interest the student of early photography. While author John Esten seems to consider these to be works of art in their own right, they clearly served primarily as reference material for Eakins. This is most obvious in the swimming pictures and in one painting called \\"The Wrestlers\\" which--muscle for muscle, sinew for sinew--is based on a photograph he took of fellow art students in Paris in 1899 (pages 68 and 69).<br />The book includes a 2-page chronology of Eakins's life and a bibliography. The latter is a very short list; it only cites 19 works, two of which are books of poetry (Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass\\" makes sense, but I fail to see the relevance of \\"The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake\\".) Very relevant but not cited is Helen Cooper's excellent 1996 book \\"Thomas Eakins: The Rowing Pictures\\" (ISBN 0-300-06939-1). If your primary interest is a book of beautifully reproduced images, these shortcomings will not bother you.	2003-01-13

But if Singer's portrait of Madame Pierre Gautreau (\\"Madame X\\") was considered scandalous because he painted her with a dropped shoulder strap (later repainted in its proper position), then you can understand why these male nudes (mostly charcoal sketches and quick watercolors, but also some finished oil paintings) were kept unexhibited for so long. We have Sargent's sisters to thank that they were not destroyed outright, but carefully placed with museums for safekeeping.<br />If text is the clothing of art books, then Donna Hassler has provided THE MALE NUDES with less than a loin cloth. But there's not much that needs to be said, anyway. The plates should be enjoyed in their own right. I especially enjoyed the charcoal drawings. They are contextless and their strong outlines give them extra punch and a sense of iconic completeness. Though well rounded and subtly shaded, they remind me somehow of Jean Cocteau's spirited line drawings. The watercolors reminded me of Winslow Homer's. All in all, a nice little book.	2003-01-11

McDonald and Sanders have done an excellent job of convoking the best and brightest to discuss issues around the formation and understanding of the biblical canon.(Their use of the word \\"debate\\" for the title may be a bit of an overstatement considering the respectful collegiality of the participants.) Every contributor is a highly credentialed major player in the field. The editors express disappointment that Bruce Metzger, Roger Beckwith, Earle Ellis, Brevard Childs, and Gerald Sheppard were unable for various reasons to contribute articles. While their thoughts would have been interesting, the 31 Jewish and Christian scholars who did contribute are not to be considered second string (many of whom quote and reference the five absent giants anyway).<br />My enthusiasm for the thought contained in this 662-page book is based on having read the introduction and five randomly selected articles: \\"The Notion and Definition of Canon\\" (Eugene Ulrich), \\"Jamnia Revisited\\" (Jack P. Lewis), \\"The Old Testament Apocrypha in the Early Church and Today\\" (David J. Harrington, S.J.), \\"The Codex and Canon Consciousness\\" (Robert A. Kraft), and \\"The Problem of Pseudonymity in Biblical Literature and Its Implication\\" (Kent D. Clarke). As far as I can tell, these are new papers, not reworkings of existing materials. Harrington's thoughts on the Apocrypha, for instance, go far beyond anything he expressed on this subject in his own excellent book, INTVITATION TO THE APOCRYPHA (1999). Clarke's article on Pseudonymity answered a lot of questions I've had about this issue and I felt it did a good job of showing how a person's assumptions about a biblical book's pseudonymity (whether the practice is honorable, innocent, and licit or dishonorable, deceptive, and illicit) affects how a person is likely to judge that book's status within the canon. So far I've been impressed with everything I read. I look forward to savoring the remaining 26 articles.<br />Editor McDonald provided four interesting appendices and the bibliography is worth the cost of the book (they seem to identify English translations of scholarly works created in other languages when possible, though I noticed they did not do so with Trobisch's FIRST EDITION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, Oxford, 2000; otherwise, the bibliography seems to be quite current).<br />If you're at all curious about how the Bible came to be and why different religious traditions have different Bibles, THE CANON DEBATE will give you lots to mull over.

While Lincoln Kirstein's 1992 monograph includes reproductions of all of Cadmus's major paintings, it only has a dozen or so of his figurative drawings. Justin Spring's book more than makes up for this lack (it has 67 color plates). The fact that he does so by taking on the seemingly narrow focus of male nudes is truly appropriate. While the paintings are often highly active, heavily detailed social satires with not-so-subtle homoerotic elements, the drawings are calmer, context-free, more admiring meditations on the male form. They are clearly the work of an attentive observer and a disciplined draughtsman. When the art world was going ga-ga over abstract expressionism and slap-dash gestural drawing, Cadmus was painstakingly working in virtual isolation. And though a number of sketches are included in this volume, it is the finished drawing that most interested Cadmus. Reginald Marsh, Jared French, Pierro dela Francesca, Michaelangelo, Signorelli, and Ingres were his dominent influences. Along with ballet photographer George Platt Lynes. And from writer E.M. Forster he acquired a philosophic outlook that would guide him both as an artist and as a man: \\"tolerance, good temper and sympathy--they are what matter...if the human race is not to collapse.\\"<br />Spring's five essays (Introduction, Beginnings, Development, Maturity, Conclusion) provide everything you need to know to fully appreciate the plates. He addresses Cadmus's homosexuality directly and without sensation and discusses Cadmus's well-reasoned reluctance to be associated with more blatantly sexual gay art (including his refusal to have one of his works reproduced in a biography of Tom of Finland, an admirer of Cadmus). Spring also identifies the models for many of the drawings; this is significant because Cadmus considered his drawings to be a collaboration between himself and his models. Cadmus's life partner Jon Anderson was his frequent subject from the late 60s until the artist's death, and it is fascinating to see how Anderson's body changed over time; the model clearly never lost his sense of comfort and ease modeling nude.<br />Not revisionist history, just a long overdue update on a neglected but significant American artist of the 20th century. Universe Publishing (a division of Rizzoli International Publications) is to be commended on the design and quality of this book.60s until the artist's death, and it is fascinating to see how Anderson's body changed over time; the model clearly never lost his sense of comfort and ease modeling nude.<br />Not revisionist history, just a long overdue update on a neglected but significant American artist of the 20th century.

Or at least that \\"Isabel\\" is a composite of every young woman the author ever dated and not a real individual person. Although de Botton catalogs many of \\"Isabel's\\" quirky habits (her poor sense of geography, the way she picks her nose and chews on the callouses on her fingers, etc.), he exhibits enough of his own dubious traits (for instance, he admits letting her plants die unwatered while devouring half a box of her chocolates while house-sitting for her one time) to give us a sense that in some unprovable way, he is at least playing fair.<br />But under this delicious patina of pettiness, there are a number of more serious subjects. Such as the nature of biography itself. And whether our versions of ourselves are any more reliable than those of an outside observer. The nature of memory. And a comparison of the virtues and liabilities of the fat, detail-obsessed Boswelian biographies versus the \\"toast-sized\\", summary-style biographical sketches of an Aubrey. (Anyone who has read--or tried to write--an obituary for a family member will find the chapter \\"In Search of an Ending\\" fascinating.) And anyone who is familiar with de Botton's other works will not be surprised how he manages to draw the likes of Marcel Proust, Adam Smith, Frederick Nietzsche, Tolstoy, and Hippocrates into the conversation, as well as zany bits of pop psychology like graphology, palmistry, and magazine personality questionnaires. To support the trope that KISS AND TELL is a real biography, de Botton even provides a 12-page, fully functioning index (complete with entries on \\"toenails\\" and \\"sex.\\") As a work of fiction, KISS AND TELL isn't nearly as interesting as his earlier novel, ON LOVE, but it is an amusing book...and it will make you think about your own quirks and self-delusions.	2002-12-28

De Botton seems to have given his new book, like two of his previous volumes (HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE and THE CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY), a self-satirizing title. But like those earlier works, THE ART OF TRAVEL exhibits a strong belief in the ability of art, observation, and thinking about art to make a difference on how one experiences one's own life and place in the world. His interest in \\"stay-at-home\\" artists, first evidenced in his study of Proust, continues. THE ART OF TRAVEL is comprised of nine chapters. The first (\\"On Anticipation\\") uses the disappointment of the decadent aesthete \\"hero\\" of J.K. Huysmans's novel A REBOURS as the basis of an exploration of why the experience of travel never seems to match our expectations (at least for those of us who are well-read). Huysmans's Parisian hero had a hankering to see London after reading a Dickens novel, made preparations for his trip, but got no further than an English tavern in Paris when he \\"was abruptly overcome by lassitude.\\" In the final chapter (\\"On Habit\\") de Botton identifies an author who takes Huysmans's and Proust's approach to travel to the extreme--Xavier de Maistre. The work is JOURNEY AROUND MY BEDROOM. (The man and the book exist; I checked the Internet.) De Botton, in his humorously endearing way tries to follow de Maistre's example...but his bedroom is too small (and too crowded with books, I might add...He gives us a photograph.) Instead, he uses his immediate neighborhood as a basis for seeing what there is to see when one makes up one's mind to notice the details one would notice (without prompting) in more exotic locales. Sandwiched between these two chapters are excellent essays based on an examination of the works and world views of Charles Baudelaire & Edward Hopper (\\"On Traveling Places\\"); Gustave Flaubert (\\"On the Exotic\\"); the detail obsessed Alexander von Humboldt (\\"On Curiosity\\"); the ever-peripatetic William Wordsworth (\\"On the Country and the City\\"); Edmund Burke and the anonymous author of JOB (\\"On the Sublime\\"); the late-blooming but revolutionary artist Vincent van Gogh (\\"On Eye-Opening Art\\"); and the highly articulate artist John Ruskin (\\"On Possessing Beauty\\"). As with de Botton's earlier books, there will be those who feel he has been too superficial in his examination of his sources and too quick to see their application for our lives today. But I disagree. I find that he gives the reader plenty to think about without burdening us with too much analysis. He gives us the box and opens the lid. It's the reader's job to make the connections and explore the contents.<br />If nothing else, this book left me with the desire to read van Gogh's letters (which I own) and anything by Ruskin (which I don't own but will certainly start looking for on Amazon.com; I found Ruskin's observation about the twin purposes of art to be as true today as when he noted them: to make sense of pain and to fathom the sources of beauty, p. 233.)e anonymous author of JOB (\\"On the Sublime\\"); the late-blooming but revolutionary artist Vincent van Gogh (\\"On Eye-Opening Art\\"); and the highly articulate artist John Ruskin (\\"On Possessing Beauty\\").

The bars, restaurants, public relations offices, apartment buildings (old and new), provided an exciting backdrop to the club-hopping, trend-setting characters in that movie. The combination of modern architecture and the thoughtful repurposing of nineteenth century factories and warehouses struck me as exciting and playful.<br />Although I have been unable to identify any of the buildings from the movie in David Hands and Sarah Parker's \\"little guide to [Manchester's] recent architecture,\\" the book did confirm my sense that the people of Manchester have worked hard to be neither pure preservationists nor reckless redevelopers. Each of the 65 structures covered is represented by one or two photographs and receives, at the most, a page and a half of descriptive text. The photographs are beautiful black and white images, though sometimes it is difficult to tie the image (often a detail, such as an entryway) to any particular description within the text. The writing is delicious and beautiful in its own right, even when you're not quite sure what the authors are talking about. (For instance, this of Malmaison: \\"To avoid pastiche the new facade is grey-granite aggregate and concrete block. Designed to be behind the Hoyles building, sliding into a former lightwell in its V-shaped plan. This juxtaposition has informally bonded the two volumes, creating a large hard-landscaped piazza, clearly identifying the hotel's presence and purpose.\\") There's a lot in these descriptions to unpack, but I feel the authors have made astute observations and assessments (usually positive, though they are not afraid to deliver a well-earned jab here and there as well).<br />As a guide, I felt it suffered from the lack of a good, comprehensive introduction (for instance, I would like to have learned more about Manchester's industrial past and to have gotten an analysis of how the city responded to the 1996 IRA bombing that was responsible for much of the city's recent rebuilding).

Compare, for instance, these statements from the Introduction to Job:<br />[1995 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) the date of the man Job and his historical setting, and (2) the date of the inspired writer who composed the book.&quot;<br />[2002 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) that of Job himself, and (2) the composition of the book.&quot;<br />While the editors have not gone overboard trying to turn the NIVSB into a &quot;pc/inclusive language&quot; text, they have restated a few things here and there that, to my sensibilities, seemed worth fixing. For instance:<br />[1995 ed., from Wisdom Literature Introduction] &quot;The Jews sometimes speak of the OT as the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.&quot;<br />[2002 ed., page 725] &quot;An ancient tradition among the Jews divided the collection of their holy books into three major divisions: the Law (Pentateuch), the Prophets (Former and Latter) and the Writings.&quot;<br />These are small but welcome changes. [For those who may be following the controversy about the &quot;Today's New International Version&quot; translation, an adaptation of the NIV which endeavors to use gender-inclusive language when both men and women are clearly being discussed or addressed, the NIVSB uses the &quot;unaltered&quot; NIV. This is a good choice for a Study Bible, since serious Bible students need to confront the patriarchy of the ancient world at some time or another. The notes, rather than the translation of the text, seems the best place to accomplish this.]<br />Although I see nothing in the introductions and notes that should be alarming to the book's primary audience (Evangelical Christians), the NIVSB now seems worthy to be used by Christians from other Protestant traditions, as well as by the general reader who may be curious about the Bible as one of the most important texts of Western civilization.<br />The NIVSB continues to use three &quot;icons&quot; with its introductions, charts, and notes: a &quot;seedling&quot; to suggest an item that will help the reader apply something to her/his personal life; a &quot;trowel&quot; to identify items based on archaeological discoveries; and &quot;a human head&quot; to call attention to items relating to key characters. One could read the notes carefully and dispute the way these icons have been assigned throughout the text, but the editors should be applauded for their judicious restraint. To tag more notes with icons (or to introduce more types of icons) would have created visual clutter. The publisher should also be applauded for making the icons gray instead of solid black as in the previous editon; it's easy to read around them. (I only pay close attention to the &quot;trowel&quot; icons, because I am personally curious about what in the Bible can and cannot be confirmed by external evidence; although I usually skip the &quot;seedlings&quot;--because I don't like to be told how to apply Scripture to my life--these notes often discuss key theological concepts and are equally worth reading.)<br />The typography is improved in the 2002 edition, most notably in the center column reference system. However, I still find it difficult to know where to look when I see a superscript marker in the Scripture text (To the center column or at the foot of the Scripture text?). At some points in the text, there are two superscript markers! For example, the name &quot;Immanuel&quot; in Matthew 1:23 is followed by a roman superscript &quot;d&quot; and an italic superscript &quot;w.&quot; Oddly, both identify Isaiah 7:14 as the related text. Although, I suppose, there's nothing technically wrong with stating something more than once, I think it unnecessary in a book so tightly packed with information. The unintended effect on the reader might be to erode his/her willingness to pay attention to the notes or to bother to look things up. That would be unfortunate, indeed, because there's a lot in the revised NIV Study Bible that is worth checking out.nts in the text, there are two superscript markers!

That said, I feel the introductions and notes are well-done and helpful. Unlike the Scofield Reference Bible, it does not foist an extreme dispensationalist or fundamentalist world view on its readers. It has a number of helpful in-text charts and maps (I keep the charts on the Hebrew Calendar, Old Testament Sacrifices, and Old Testament Feasts & Sacred Days permanently tagged for quick reference). It also has a helpful 150-page concordance.<br />My gripes: (1) Words of Jesus in red (I find this device silly and hard to read), (2) Center column cross references are marked with superscript alpha letters, the same as the textual footnote system...yes, one system uses italic and the other roman letters, but as small and light as these call-out markers are it's impossible to distinguish them, and (3) some of the book introductions are a little too defensive for my taste (the authors favor the earliest possible date for the apocalyptic book of Daniel in opposition to most mainstream biblical scholars).<br />I understand that a revised and updated NIV Study Bible is going to be released by the publisher later this year. I'm sure I'll buy it, but I hope it rectifies some of the weaknesses of the current edition.	2002-10-20

While I wished the authors had provided a more richly contexted introduction, it is basically a picture book, and as such, deserves to be enjoyed on its own terms. (It should be noted, however, that each picture has a generous caption.) Sure to be of interest to people interested in the history of New York City's \\"other borroughs\\" and of Long Island, Victorian architecture, and Americana in general. The chapters on \\"A Common Faith and Temples of Education\\" and \\"The Celebrated of Richmond Hill\\" were my personal favorites. Former residents include, photojournalist/reformer Jacob Riis, Phil Rizutto, composer Morton Gould, Ernest Ball (composer of \\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\\"), and the Marx Brothers (their home still exists and bears a commemorative plaque). Babe Ruth and Mae West were known to dine at the Triangle Hoffbrau restaurant (though I presume never together). The book includes the full text of Teddy Roosevelt's 1903 whistle stop campaign speech. Besides a longer introduction, I wish the book had a \\"then-and-now\\" map. When the village was first laid out streets were given names (like Elm Street, Oak Street, etc.); after the village was incorporated into Greater New York along with the rest of Queens, streets were stripped of these picturesque monikers and came to be identified by numbers (even with this innovation, any motorist without satellite navigation will tell you it's nearly impossible to find one's way around Queens...and for those of us who live here, that's just fine).<br />Overall, I would say Ballenas and Cataldi have produced a nice piece of nostalgia which serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in learning more about this part of Queens.	2002-09-18

Like his sports books (&quot;October 1964&quot; and &quot;Summer '49&quot; about the world of baseball, and &quot;The Amateurs&quot; about the unnoted world of rowing), &quot;Firehouse&quot; is about a group of men who live in an insular world (an eviable subculture, almost). These are brave men who look after one another, test and tease one another, have trouble expressing their feelings (though Halberstam assures us they feel deeply), and do it all by some sort of finely-tuned Hemingwavian code of honor. What he presents is a sort of northern male version of &quot;Steel Magnolias.&quot; If you work in an academic institution or office setting where daily sniping, political intrigue, and constant back-biting are de rigueur, it's hard not to be seduced by the comraderie revealed in these pages.<br />The stories of the thirteen firefighters from a single FDNY firehouse that lost their lives in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are carefully intertwined, a structural device that reinforces the sense of intimacy and interdependence that Halberstam so strongly evokes. Do not expect a dramatic depiction of what actually occurred on that tragic date, Halberstam is honest enough not to try and create details that can no more be recovered from the chaos of that day than most victims' bodies are likely to be found among the rubble. The story is in the simplicity of the firefighters' mission and training. We witness survivors wondering at their &quot;luck,&quot; the odd circumstances that put them somewhere else when their company was called to action. It is to Halberstam's credit that he does not presume to understand or explain these painful ironies.<br />If you read the article Halberstam wrote for Vanity Fair on the same subject, you will be hard pressed to find additional details in this &quot;expanded&quot; version. But that's not a reason to dismiss the book. Halberstam gives us a glance at a world most of us assumed disappeared years ago. A world where honest, unpretentious people care deeply for their comrades, take their responsibilties seriously, and give of themselves sacrificially.<br />The book is a &quot;keeper&quot; and is going on my shelf with other gender studies titles, like E. Anthony Rotundo's &quot;American Manhood&quot; and Clifford Putney's &quot;Muscular Christianity.&quot;lberstam gives us a glance at a world most of us assumed disappeared years ago.

You don't need to know New Testament Greek to follow Trobisch's arguments. Although an astute reader and clever interpreter of textual evidence, Trobisch spares us the usual myopia and nit picking textual critics like to heap upon their readers. He avoids discussions of authorial authenticity that so easily put many people on the defensive. Instead, he helps the reader appreciate larger redactional issues of how the different components of the New Testament relate to one another. By making comparisons to familiar modern publishing practices, Trobisch makes his arguments easily accessible to the modern reader (for example, he shows how the decisions publishers and editors make and the conventions they establish can affect the final form of the text as much, perhaps, as those of the authors.) There's much here I'll want to re-examine when I've done more reading in this area, but on my first read-through I found Trobisch's thesis exciting and refreshing. This book has certainly changed the way I'll be reading the New Testament from now on.<br />Trobisch's aim was &quot;to describe the history of the Canonial Edition by analyzing the oldest existing copies and tracing the edition back to the time and place of first publication. With this method, Greek manuscripts became more important witnesses than the lists of canonical writings, quotes from biblical literature, and debates about the authenticity of certain writings, translations, and so on.&quot; (p. 37) By doing this, Trobisch is able to draw some interesting conclusions: (1) that the editors of the New Testament took great care in naming the different sections of the Bible, and in doing so validated, rather than minimized, the place of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible, (2) that the sequence of the four Gospels as we have it today is a tradition of long-standing, and one that makes good sense even though it means separating Luke from Acts (his explanation of the role of John 21 in this regard is truly fascinating, p. 96ff), (3) that the &quot;first edition&quot; of the New Testament would have positioned the General Letters after Acts and before the Letters of Paul (the logic being, in part, that the first half of Acts introduces the reader to Peter, John and James, and it is only in the second part that Acts starts to focus on the missionary efforts of Paul), (4) that the editors used an elegant system of internal cross referencing to validate both the authority of the leaders in Jerusalem and of Paul (this seeming harmony serving as a unified barrier against Marcionite error), and (5)that the editors managed to straddle the potentially devisive issue of the date upon which Easter should be celebrated by including both the Synoptic and Johannine traditions. Just to name a few! And don't skip the fascinating discussion of the codex (&quot;bound book&quot;) v. the scroll in the establishment of the Canonical Edition of the Bible (p. 69-77).<br />I must admit the flow of Trobisch's argument was so engrossing that I never really examined the endnotes. But they're there and they're detailed. The bibliography is substantial, too (but be warned, it includes a high percentage of German works).<br />This book is truly worth the investment (both in money and in the time you'll spend digging into it).

US	50086375	R31NXHEGTTU3BF	0393020312	635446223	The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith	Books	5	17	18	N	N	The Talented Patricia Highsmith	My interest in Patricia Highsmith was sparked by the two movies based on her novel \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" (the Matt Damon picture and \\"Purple Noon\\" in which Alain Delon plays Tom Ripley). I have read a couple of the other Ripley novels, but continue to prefer the first one over any of the sequels. In researching Highsmith on the Internet, I saw a collection of stories called \\"Little Tales of Misogyny\\" listed in her bibliography. Needless to say, the title intrigued me. Though many of the stories in \\"The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith\\" have been continuously in print, I have been unable to find a copy the Misogyny Tales.<br />The Misogyny Tales take up about 60 pages of this 724-page collection, each tale being only 3 to 5 pages long. It's hard to know what to make of them. Each story features a female character who embodies a specific aspect of the feminine personality; Highsmith allows this quality to unravel to the fullest extent possible, always to the detriment of those who live with or near the protagonists. The titles of the indivdual stories will give you an idea of the range of topics covered: \\"The Invalid, or, the Bedridden,\\" \\"The Middle-Class Housewife,\\" \\"The Breeder,\\" \\"The Perfect Little Lady,\\" \\"The Prude,\\" \\"The Victim,\\" etc. As damning as these stories are of their protagonists, in most cases the reader is likely to be somewhat in awe of the misguided heroines (as we are of the amoral Tom Ripley). Highsmith draws these characters with quick bold strokes using indelible ink. The reader is not given time to warm up to any of the characters and in the end they function more as archetypes than as full-blown fictional characters. Does Highsmith have nothing but contempt for her own sex? Possibly (think of Marge Sherwood in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\"). Does she resist feminist rhetoric and politcal correctness? Certainly (you need only read \\"The Victim\\" to be convinced of this). Can she write in an honest and thought-provoking way? Absolutely! In some ways her attacks on middle-class convention and mores remind me of the stories of H.H. Munro (Saki) and Shirley Jackson--ironic and hard-hitting at the same time. Even when being her most brutal, she leaves room for pathos.<br />According to the dust jacket, Highsmith turned to writing short stories later in her life (beginning in the 70s). \\"Little Tales of Misogyny,\\" interestingly, was first published in German (1975) before being published in English (1977). My only wish is that with a book of this nature (one spanning the author's entire career) that the date of authorship was given for each story. (It helps to know, for instance, that \\"Little Tales of Misogyny\\" was written during the height of the 70s feminist movement.)<br />The book, by the way, is very handsomely typeset and bound, worthy of an author whose recognition and esteem seems to be growing since her death in 1995.

And I suspect a careful historian or a reader who cared enough to do a little investigative research could catch author Marc Eliot on a number of factual and interpretive errors. Even so, DOWN 42ND STREET was a fun read. One of Eliot's most delicious vices is his ability to draw (nearly libelous) caricatures of many of the key players in New York's history, most notably its mayors. (For instance, this about Ed Koch's repsonse to the porn, drug, and prostitution situation on 42nd Street: \\"No problem, Koch insisted. Just leave everything to him. From here on in, he told one and all, it was going to be nothing but smooth sailing. After which, the smiling, gesticulating mayor, the ever-loquacious captain of the good ship \\"New York,\\" led himself and the city straight into the worst political storm of his career.\\") The overweening journalistic style exhibits itself in  Eliot's tendency to frequently end chapters with semi-mysterious cliff-hangers designed to keep us reading. It works, but I read on with a much eroded sense of trust.<br />If you're willing to look past all that, and if you appreciate seeing large complex chunks of history telescoped into compact coctail-party-sized anecdotes, you'll enjoy this brief history of a truly fascinating piece of New York real estate. And one thing Eliot makes clear is that it IS all about real estate (i.e., money). Enormous and bizarre egos clash in scramble for profits. The history of 42nd Street is the history of corruption and neglect on the part of public officials; fear, fascination, and indifference on the part of citizens and tourists; and greed held in check by caution on the part of the private sector. In other words, there has been enough ambivalence about 42nd Street to keep Midtown in limbo (if not hell) for almost five decades. Eliot depicts this dilemma well. He also discusses what has been missing from most newspapers' accounts of the \\"resurrection\\" of 42nd Street: the fact that it was Organized Crime under the leadership of the Teflon Don, John Gotti, that almost single-handedly engineered the descent of one of the world's most amazing entertainment capitals into a truly dangerous place to be, day or night.<br />Eliot's final assessment reflects many New Yorkers' cynicism about the Disney-ification of Times Square. With the influx of Mall-of-America type stores and a Toys-R-Us Ferris Wheel, can Ed Koch's pedestrian mall be far behind? Maybe so. But one thing is sure, 42nd Street is one street that never stands still.wspapers' accounts of the \\"resurrection\\" of 42nd Street: the fact that it was Organized Crime under the leadership of the Teflon Don, John Gotti, that almost single-handedly engineered the descent of one of the world's most amazing entertainment capitals into a truly dangerous place to be, day or night.<br />Eliot's final assessment reflects many New Yorkers' cynicism about the Disney-ification of Times Square.

Published at least a year later than originally announced, this volume completes the 12-volume New Interpreter's Bible Commentary (Volume 1, Genesis-Leviticus, having been published in 1994). I've really come to enjoy and rely on the broad and balanced scholarship represented in this series (although I have to admit I haven't read any of the volumes from cover to cover). Volume X has the text and commentary for The Acts of the Apostles, Romans, and 1 Corinthians,  plus an excellent &quot;Introduction to Epistolary Literature&quot; by Robert W. Wall.<br />Although the volumes are large and you'll need to dedicate 28 inches of shelf space if you intend to acquire the entire series (and you should), you'll appreciate the large, easy-to-read typeface and the inclusion of two English translations of every passage of the Bible (NRSV and NIV for the 66 books used by both Protestants and Roman Catholics; NRSV and NAB for the Deuterocanonical Books read primarily by Catholics). Besides verse-by-verse commentary, each book has a general introduction, &quot;Overviews&quot; to large sections within the books, and periodic &quot;Reflections&quot; (intended, I presume, to help kick-start many a pastor's sermon preparation). In addition, there are occasional Excursuses on a variety of fascinating topics (although there are none in Volume X, there are 4 in Volume VIII on the Gospel of Matthew). On the off chance that these commentaries won't answer every question you may have, the detailed footnotes and thorough bibliographies will direct you to all the right sources.<br />My only gripe is that the series does not cover ALL the books of the Apocrypha as represented in the NRSV translation. There is nothing, for instance, on 1 and 2 Esdras or 3 and 4 Maccabees. My copy of Volume X came with an announcement that in Spring 2003, Abingdon Press would be coming out with the New Interpreter's Study Bible. I plan to pre-order it as soon as I can. My only hope is that this Bible will include the Apocryphal books they neglected in the Commentary. The announcment also stated that an index volume would be issued in Fall 2003.

He seems to intuitively know what is important--whether providing a theological overview of Chrisitan history or, as here, focusing in on a single subject. What I found especially refreshing in BACH AMONG THE THEOLOGIANS is Pelikan's appreciation of Bach as a highly creative man who was truly a man of his own time. He puts to rest (for me anyway) the somewhat artificial argument about the sacred and secular strains in Bach's work. This &quot;tension&quot; ultimately does not seem to have been as big a deal for Bach as it has become for modern historians, musicians, theologians, etc. Perhaps, because Bach's sense of the sacred was much more encompassing than we highly compartmentalized moderns ever allow it to be. In any case, the fact that so many highly divergent groups want to claim Bach as their own is probably sufficient proof of Bach's transcendant greatness.<br />This is a highly readable--though thoughtful and concentrated--book that deserves to be more broadly available. Perhaps some publisher will see fit to reissue it in paperback. I'd preorder a copy today if that was the case.	2002-07-21
US	50086375	R1ZQ7838MDROH	0664224091	114438458	Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism	Books	3	12	12	N	Y	Fascinating but frustrating reference work	An encylopedia of Evangelicalism--a true encyclopedia--is badly needed. This book, unfortunately, does not fill that need. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, edited by Cross and Livingstone, is a serious, carefully researched, and authoritative reference work that has always been disappointing when I've turned to it for information on American Christianity in general and Evangelical traditions in particular (for example, it contains nothing on Aimee Semple McPherson or Billy Sunday). I purchased Balmer's book hoping it would serve as a supplement to the Oxford Dictionary. While it fills some information gaps, its analysis of key issues is suprisingly superficial (when attempted at all).<br />For the most part the Encyclopedia is more an A-to-Z quick reference to the American Evangelical subculture with special attention to the last quarter of the 20th century. By comparing the lengths of articles, you can see how major issues get reduced to brief summaries and matters of minor and transient importance get inflated beyond merit. Gospel Music gets 1/3 column of text and hymn writer Fanny Crosby, 1/2 column. But Contemporary Christian Music gets 4 columns; Amy Grant, 2 columns; Michael English, 2 columns; Sandi Patty, 2 columns; Jars of Clay, 1 1/2 columns. This is not to say that the articles on Mr. English and Ms Patty weren't interesting in a dishy, People Magazine kind of way; it's just to call into question Balmer's editorial judgment. Also of note, there is a one column entry in Exodus International, a ministry founded in 1976 to rescue homosexuals and lesbians from their deviant lifestyle, but nothing on Evangelicals Concerned, a more gay-affirming national evangelical ministry founded one year earlier. The absurdity of what gets emphasized and what doesn't is thrown into high relief by the frequently cross-referenced half column article on Ronald Wilson Reagan. While it gives the date he became governor of California, it does not say when he was elected president of the United States; nor does it cite even one book or article we can turn to for a deeper analysis of Reagan's political and religious views.<br />By way of comparison, the longest article I was able to locate in the Encyclopedia is the one on Methodism (8 columns of text). The one on Evangelicalism runs one column shorter. Considering its brevity it does a reasonably good job of giving a succinct overview of the subject. I found one statement in this article especially helpful in understanding the editorial perspective behind entire Encyclopedia: \\"Evangelicalism in America has largely retained [these] characteristics: the centrality of conversion, the quest for an affective piety, and a suspicion of wealth, worldliness, and ecclesiastical pretension.\\"<br />The complaint of superficiality and noncritical presentation of topics is further evidenced in the works referenced at the ends of articles. Often the source cited is the official organ of the church body or organization under discussion, rarely a more scholarly work. Similarly, for articles on people, the editors cite those persons' autobiographies. While I'm sure I'd find Fanny Crosby's autobiography fascinating, I would also like to know if a more analytical work written by a church historian or musicologist exists.<br />Another frustrating thing about this book, which is perhaps common to all first editions of reference books, is the evidence of sloppy or rushed copy editing. For instance, there is a frequent bold-faced cross reference to an article on Modernism; when you turn to Modernism there is no article, but you are sent to the article on Liberalism; at Liberalism (not the exact equivalent of Modernism in my thinking) you get a short article and a cross reference back to Modernism. Ooops! There is also some sloppiness with dates: David Livingstone, who was born in 1813, is said to have made his first trip to Africa in 1741; Aimee Semple McPherson, who died in 1944, is said to have beenburied in October 1994.<br />Even with the aforementioned gripes, this book provides some interesting and lively reading. The articles on McPherson and Cyrus Ingersoll Scofield, for instance, were actually quite touching. And there is the occasional useful fact (Did you know that Goshen College has the largest collection of information on Anabaptism and the Reformation in America?). This books is perhaps best appreciated as self-directed casual reading. So if you find yourself one night unable to fall asleep for fear that the Rapture will occur before you have a chance to repent of your latest sins, this is the book you'll want to have on your bedside table.buried in October 1994.<br />Even with the aforementioned gripes, this book provides some interesting and lively reading.

But there is still evidence that Leavitt is a keen observer of human behavior and modern life. (Although he sometimes sets his stories in another time period, I find it easiest to surrender to the ones that are firmly set in the present--even if that \\"present\\" spans a couple of decades, as in the title story of this collection.) He continues to reference the detritus of modern life (Filofax datebooks, email, automatic pool cleaners), but he does this selectively and, unlike Bret Easton Ellis and others of their generation, he does not overwhelm his readers with brand names and expect us to understand the relative prestige of every product named. His focus is on the workings of the human heart and will, though the social context of his characters is never out of sight. For me, his approach to story telling falls somewhere between that of de Maupassant and Checkhov.<br />Leavitt experiments in post-modern story telling in \\"Route 80,\\" a two-part self-reflexive story about a pair of lovers who have broken up; \\"Speonk,\\" a story with three possible endings about a recently retired soap opera star's efforts to reach the small town of Speonk on eastern Long Island one night and the way his daytime drama personality does (or does not) draw reactions from the people he encounters on the way; and \\"The List,\\" a modern epistolary story told entirely through the emails exchanged by gay academics, some of whom have never met.<br />By far the most post-modern story in this collection is \\"The Infection Scene,\\" the story of two young gay men who make a pact to have unprotected sex so that the uninfected partner can share in his lover's impending doom from AIDS, interwoven with a fictionalized historical account of Alfred Lord Douglas's equally destructive relationship with Oscar Wilde. The contemporary story has the ghoulishness of an urban legend while the historical story seems too confident of its own grasp of the facts to be believable. The ultimate effect (which I suspect is intentional) is to leave the reader questioning the validity and plausibility of any story. As cynical as it may seem, stories, Leavitt seems to be saying, can ultimately do little more than amuse. They cannot teach anything, reveal anything, or guide us through life. You, gentle reader, are what you choose to believe.<br />This theme also dominates the best story in the collection, \\"Black Box.\\" Here, using very traditional story-telling techniques, Leavitt chooses one metaphor (the search for fallen commercial jet's black box) to hover in the background of his story. Although certainly written before 9/11/01, it addresses the Grand Guignol aspects of human behavior that have come to the fore since the terrorist attacks of that tragic day. One senses that the lives of people caught up in the numbing banality of modern life are so devoid of meaning that there is an almost romantic surrendering to tragedy and horror. As one character observes, \\"It's curious how hungry, almost lustful, people get for details. Especially if there's some horrible irony, like the person had just missed another plane\\" (p. 101). The question seems to be, where do people turn to find meaning and from what do we manufacture it?<br />Overall, a decent and thoughtful collection of stories, though not as unified and stunning as FAMILY DANCING.with Oscar Wilde.

There are few characters in this tale. And the two main characters seem to represent so much. These two characters are the narrator, Michael Berg, who begins his account with the story of how he lost his virginity at age 15 to a 36 year old streetcar conductor named Hanna Schmitz, and the streetcar conductor herself, whose life continues to interlace with Berg's. Their story spans a period of about thiry years, a period long enough for Michael to learn much about pride, guilt, shame, disappointment, and the ability of human beings to numbly accept just about any degree of indignity. At first I was taken aback by the affair between the schoolboy and the conductor (were the sexes reversed, I wondered whether most readers would have been either outraged or guiltily titilated). But, in the end, the narrator seems to come to a point where he has a perspective on how he had been exploited. Indeed, this experience of exploitation seems to parallel even greater forms of human exploitation and becomes key to understanding many of the other things that unfold in this tale. The way the story progresses is truly masterful and to describe the plot would deprive readers of their own first impressions. Schlink seems to have William Faulkner's gift to force readers to reconsider each character's merits chapter after chapter. If you can, stay away from any review that reveals too much about the storyline. Surrender to the experience of discovery and reflection.<br />This brief novel seems grounded in major philosophical and theological issues--like the roles of conscience and the will. In fact, the stunning paragraph on pp. 19-20 about conscience (\\"Often enough in my life I have done things I had not decided to do.\\") seems to come right out of St. Paul (\\"I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.\\" Romans 7:18,19). The nature of evil and moral lassitude is at the very heart of this book. Another association: The narrator's description of his desire to achieve numbness on a skiing trip called to mind the conversation between the man and the woman about indifference in Marguerite Duras's screenplay for \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\" (ISBN 0802131042). This association may be especially apt considering that Renais's film involves painful recollections of the World War II experiences of a French woman who was ostracized for her love affair with a German soldier and of a Japanese man's experience of the Hiroshima bombing.<br />The \\"tale-like\\" quality of the story also made me wonder if the reader wasn't being asked to make something of the main characters' names. \\"Berg\\" is somewhat ethnically ambiguous; \\"Michael\\" is the name of one of the militant angels; \\"Hanna\\" means \\"grace\\" and was the name of a pious Jew in the Hebrew Bible.<br />\\"The Reader\\" is a powerful story.

The letters of thanks sent to Hanff and the enthusiasm with which the booksellers greeted friends of the author who happened to visit the shop when taking their vacations in England shows that their affection for their American friend was sincere and deep.<br />Don't read this collection with the expectation that you will get an in-depth view of the characters' lives.

Readers who see it as a novel usually have complaints about it's structure and seeming lack of plot (if this is what you desire, you can always rent the movie).

When a composer does not provide the words to his own music, what are we to judge him by? And when the words are drawn from a sacred text or determined by a liturgical context? With a composer like Wagner who vehemently embraced a nationalistic gestalt, it is easy to understand the accusations of anti-Semitism. With Bach, it is less so.<br />Consequently the brevity of Michael Marissen's 36-page essay on the subject of anti-Judaism in Bach's St. John Passion. Marissen's methodology is to briefly examine the parts of John's Gospel that have caused scholars to deem it the most anti-Judaic of the four canonical Gospels, to review the choral responses to the biblical texts in light of Lutheran theology as it would have been understood a century after the Reformer's death (Bach owned many volumes of Luther's writings as well as the Calov and Olearius Bible Commentaries), and to compare what Bach actually did with what he could have done (as evidenced by what other musicians did and by the approaches taken in such popular culture forms as the passion plays). Only rarely does Marissen turn to an analysis of the music to make his points. He does this in his discussion of cadence in relation to Jesus' sense of his own identity (p. 12-14) and in his discussion as to whether Bach used fugue to express the obstinacy of Jesus' Jewish adversaries (p.30 ff). Musical discussion within the text is keyed to the recording of Sigiswald Kuijken (editio classica 77041-2-RG, BMG Music), though an Appendix of Musical Examples lists seven other recordings of the work as well.<br />The central essay is well argued and easy to follow. The footnotes are extensive and helpful, as is the list of Works Cited. The Annotated Literal Translation of the Libretto, which makes up the second half of the book, uses different type treatments to help the reader distinguish between Gospel text, chorale responses to the biblical narrative, and aria/arioso responses. The book also includes a 5-page Appendix on Anti-Judaism and Bach's Other Works (namely, the Cantatas for the 10th Sunday after Trinity and the St. Matthew Passion).aria/arioso responses.

This pamphlet is directed primarily to music directors and singers. I am neither, have no musical training, and cannot read music (so subtract 11 pages of coloratura exercises...which reduces it to only 55 pages of actual text).<br />Since my church performs Bach cantatas frequently, I was looking for something that could give me a little background information on Bach and the musical forms he chose to work in. This book doesn't really provide that, but the carefully compiled Annotated Bibliography (of mostly English works) lists a number of titles that seem quite promising. Since I am primarily interested in Bach's choral works from the perspective of how they fit into the liturgy, I found Father Martin Shannon's chapter &quot;Soli Deo Gloria&quot; to be the most rewarding. That chapter alone was worth the price of the book.	2002-04-02

I bought KEY WEST TALES because (a) I had recently been to Key West, and (b) being a collection of short stories, I knew I could jump to another story if I didn't like the one I was reading.<br />This collection of stories, more than anything, reminded me of Sherwood Anderson's WINESBURG, OHIO. I have become distrustful of fiction writers who load up their characters with endearing (or annoying) idiosyncrasies in order to make them more memorable (as much as I enjoyed Berendt's MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, I suspect he indulged in this vice a bit). Like the citizens of Winesburg, Ohio, Hersey's Key West natives are believable people experiencing a plausible share of dissonance with the world they seem trapped in. The result is often poignant, as in \\"The Two Lives of Consuela Castanon,\\" the story of an obese young receptionist who resists, then acquiesces to the advances of a handsome young man not from Key West. In fact, Hersey comes close to replicating the eeriness and desperation of Shirley Jackson's \\"The Daemon Lover.\\" The best crafted story in the collection is \\"Fantasy Fest,\\" a story about a woman who has been contacted by the son she had put up for adoption when he was an infant. In his letter to her he suggests that they each dress up as \\"their own particular fantasy\\" about themselves and join in Key West's Halloween parade. He is confident that using this ploy they will both be naturally drawn to one another. Does it work? Do they meet? I wouldn't dream of spoiling the story for you. The longest story in the collection, \\"Get Up, Sweet Slug-a-bed,\\" is the story of a gay man dying of AIDS and of the people in his life. This is no TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. The relationships are complex and unsentimental. Like Anderson, Hersey does not people his world with saintly or purely wicked folk. It's a fallen world, for sure, one peopled with sinners, many of whom act with the best intentions.<br />Intercut with the short stories are fictionalized glimpses of Key West's history and legends. Neither Hersey, his widow, nor his editor reveals the publication history of the pieces that make up this collection, but I suspect the \\"historical\\" pieces were items Hersey wrote for the local newspaper. Taken together, they give the reader a sense of place. Key West is more that the southernmost town in the United States, a tourist destination, or a gay haven. It's a place with a history, a place that has always honored independent thinking. The historical vignettes bring more than color to this collection, they provide its spine.<br />This collection is Hersey's swan song...and he sings it well.a fallen world, for sure, one peopled with sinners, many of whom act with the best intentions.<br />Intercut with the short stories are fictionalized glimpses of Key West's history and legends.

He assures us that the influence of the BCP will continue to mold that tradition, but that the tradition will continue to expand, embracing multicultural influences, new views on sexuality, and the evolving dominance of nonprint media. Lee refutes charges that Epicopalians' reliance on their Book limits their expression of faith and spends several chapters helpfully explicating its various liturgies. Along the way, he provides a brief (too brief, by my accounting) history of how the BCP/1979 came to be, including discussion of the influence of the Scottish prayer books of 1637 and 1764, early efforts to reintroduce ancient forms of worship based on scholarly research on the liturgy. In the end, Lee eloquently affirms, \\"We ask the liturgy to bear an enormous weight of meaning. Good ritual that is capable of bearing such weight depends on a certain familiarity so that the forms, actions, and texts can become vehicles for the meaning they embody. If members of the assembly have to wonder what is going to happen THIS Sunday morning, it can lessen their ability to worship. If they have to worry about getting the words right...they may be less free to encounter the Mystery of Christ in those words\\" (p. 164).<br />This book is just one of thirteen titles in The New Church's Teaching Series, a series that sets out to explain key Episcopalian positions on the practices, beliefs, and role of the church. Intended primarily for Episcopalians, I think Lutherans and Catholics will relate to many of the opinions expressed in these books. I strongly recommend the ones on the Bible: Opening the Bible by Roger Ferlo and Engaging the Word by Michael Johnston.	2002-03-10

Barnard professor Balmer gives an historian's perspective on different aspects of the Evangelical movement in our national life without placing undue emphasis on the personalities behind the scenes. At the heart of his discussion is the exploration of several key ironies. First, he marvels at the fact that Americans take their religion so seriously (compared to people from other industrialized societies). It is ironic that it is in the United States, with its Constitutional imperative to keep church and state separate, that religious expression is so vibrant, various, and abiding. He attributes the freedom of religion (and the absence of direct governmental support though taxation) as being key to the ability of native-born religions to prosper and grow exponentially. He also finds it ironic that the Fundamentalists who decry scientific modernism in every form have so willingly embraced the new technologies: radio, technology, and the Internet. Another irony he looks at is the current-day Evangelical rejection of feminism. Women are sidelined within Evangelicalism and assigned the sentimentalized role of guardians of morality. This is ironic in light of the important leadership roles women held in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century church-based reform movements.<br />This book is more handy than it is comprehensive (the endnotes direct the reader to some promising articles and books, but Balmer does not provide even a short bibliography). This book probably won't be very satisfying to serious students of American religion looking for a good introduction to the subject; but the average reader who is curious about religion and public life will find it informative. Don't skip the last chapter, \\"Vocabulary of Evangelicalism\\", in which Balmer defines the Evangelical subcategories: Fundamentalism, the Holiness Movement, Pentecostalism, and the Charismatic Movement.d the Charismatic Movement.	2002-02-23

I especially appreciated the distinction he draws between reading the Bible literally, historically, and prophetically. And anyone who considers the Bible to be a sacred text needs to read it in all three senses. Reading the Bible literally means to read exactly what's on the page (not to read into it things you remember for Sunday School or Christmas pageants)--to see it with fresh eyes. To read it historically means to be reasonably curious about the story behind the scene and to be willing to do a little background research to better understand the context of these ancient texts. And to explore the Bible in its prophetic sense is to be willing to understand what the text has to say about the way we apply the lessons of the Bible and live out our own lives today. One statement Johnston makes that I will continue to ponder for some time is, &quot;Bible readers in Christian communities do not so much need experts as they do adepts, skilled readers who can both instruct and inspire with their own passion for the Bible&quot; (p. 40).<br />The last three chapters (&quot;Who is the God of the Bible?&quot;, &quot;Who is the Jesus of the Bible?&quot;, and &quot;The Word as Sacrament&quot;) are especially thought-provoking. ENGAGING THE WORD is volume three in a twelve-part series called &quot;The New Church's Teaching Series.&quot; Volume 2, OPENING THE BIBLE by Robert Ferlo, is also worth reading and deals with more practical issues about what Christians should know in order to begin a meaningful and satisfying practice of reading the Bible.ng the Bible.	2002-02-18

This is not as specialized a reference work as you would suspect from the title. The six introductory articles are among the best I have read on the development of the canon, hermeneutics, and the status of biblical scholarship. These run a mere ten or sixteen columns each, yet feel comprehensive. They reveal the editors' infatutuation with statistical information (numbers of male named in the Bible vs. the number of females; the number of named women vs. the number of unnamed women; names that recur most frequently, etc.), and their interest in exploring what these statistics hint at. Clearly the editors and authors enjoyed creating this landmark publication. While the authors are not timid scholars, they seem to know when they have reached a dead end or hit an informational barrier. When the Bible is silent on an issue, they are comfortable acknowledging it.<br />Also worth praising is the organization of the book. Part I consists of all the women named in the Bible (including the Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal books) in alphabetical order; Part II lists all the unnamed women (or groups of women, such as, &quot;Daughters of Lot&quot; and &quot;Women at Vashti's Banquet&quot;) in Bible book order (following the NRSV sequencing) by their earliest significant Scripture reference; Part III, perhaps the most fascinating section, is a compilation of female deities and personifications (such as, &quot;Asherah/Asherim,&quot; &quot;Female Images of God in the Hebrew Bible,&quot; &quot;Woman Wisdom,&quot; and &quot;No 'Male and Female' in Christ Jesus&quot;). While great care has been made in providing cross-referencing, there is no general index to the volume. Readers will need to be very intuitive (and perhaps keep a concordance handy) if they want to find entries in Part II (the largest section of the book) by any method other than Bible book order. The volume is completed by an annotated listing of &quot;Additional Ancient Sources,&quot; which directs the reader to some important texts that never made it successfully through the maze known as canonization, but which are sure to provide some interesting information on the status and role of women at different points in the ancient world.portant texts that never made it successfully through the maze known as canonization, but which are sure to provide some interesting information on the status and role of women at different points in the ancient world.	2001-12-17

I liked that Tripolitis reduced matters to the mere essentials. I've struggled with the articles in the Anchor Bible Dictionary on many of these religions and have found them difficult to follow and perplexing...and they never seem to give one a sense of how dominant any of them were during their time. Tripolitis provides ample footnotes and a bibliography for the skeptics who want to challenge her generalizations (of which there are many) if they find them too sweeping. One I might want to follow up on myself is her statement that the concept of the individual began in the era she covers (roughly from 331 B.C.E. to the 4th century C.E.). She attributes the success of mystery religions and religions promising personal salvation to this rise of individualism.<br />Tripolitis covers the great mystery cults (Demeter, Dionysus, Isis, and Cybele), religious philosophies (Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Middle Platonism), Mithraism, Hellenistic Judaism, Christianity, and Gnosticism (both the Christian and non-Christian forms). I appreciated that Tripolitis acknowledges when information is lacking (as with the mystery cults) and that she resists the temptation to fill in the gaps with speculative psychology. Similarly, she is careful not to try to identify clear relationships between the many different Gnostic sects that emerged in the 2nd century C.E. The ultimate and lasting  success of Christianity she attributes to more than just Constantine's favor. It succeeded, she asserts, because of its universalism, ecclesiastical organization, standardized canon of Scripture, and credal formulas. In sum, this is a handy book that you'll want to keep near by as you wrestle with weightier and more opinionated tomes.	2001-12-09

Although this book may for some readers dim the halo on the Sacred Text, Malchow is not on a debunking crusade. He simply points out how much of what is found in the Bible is remarkably similar to what can be found in many different kinds of texts (legal, liturgical, sapiential) common to the Ancient Near East. Nor does he waste much ink trying to prove direct dependencies. In fact, wasting ink and killing trees is the last thing you could accuse him of doing. At 88 pages (counting the introduction and bibliography), this is a lean volume that gets right to the point. It has helpful chapters on &quot;Law Codes&quot;, &quot;The Prophetic Books,&quot; &quot;The Psalms,&quot; &quot;Late Narrative Works,&quot; and &quot;The Wisdom Literature.&quot; If Malchow's statement that much of the biblical literature was written by a privileged elite (including many of the prophets) is true, it is both astonishing and gratifying that these people so often spoke out against their own class and on behalf of the poor and marginalized. This is a book I plan to hold on to and read again and again.	2001-10-27

I found myself at times wishing that she would get on a soap box and spew alarmist Vance-Packard-like jeremiads. I wanted her to denounce the predatory industries--medical, pharmaceutical, fitness, clothing, advertising--that seem to conspire to make people (in this case, men) so discontent (and preoccupied) with themselves. But Luciano is careful not to do this. The responsibility for this mad obsession with looking good (read &quot;young&quot;) must be shared. Beginning with the 50s Organizational Man, Luciano traces how men's attitudes about themselves, their place in the economy, and their relationship with women has evolved in the last half-century. Though she presents more than adequate data (statistical and anecdotal) to make her points (her descriptions of hair-replacement and penile enlargement surgeries are not for the squeamish), it is her ability to interpret the broader economic, societal, and psychological issues that make &quot;Looking Good&quot; such a fascinating read.<br />If you read and enjoy this book, you'll probably also enjoy &quot;The Male Body: A New Look at Men in Public and in Private&quot; by Susan Bordo.

The interplay of personalities--the supersized egos of Bob Dylan, Richard Farina, and Joan Baez as well as the more humanly-proportioned ego of Mimi Baez Farina--is fascinating. Author David Hajdu is thorough in his research (extensive interviews with many people, some now deceased), unbiased in his assessments, and reasonably skeptical when quoting the subjects as they reflect on themselves and on one another. Hajdu seems well-informed on music in general and presents the phenomenon of the 60s folk revival in a way that seems true and fair (I speak as someone who has owned and still owns most of the vinyl ablumns mentioned in the book). Long before Madonna became the daring of academics for her ability to shed skins and transform herself annually, Dylan, Farina, and the elder Baez were conciously and single-mindedly crafting their personae to meet audience expectations and assure their own success. The competition among the four is extreme. But so is the affection and loyalty (distorted and self-serving though it may have been at times). One finishes the book with a sense that the key to success is wanting it deperately; talent and good luck, though nice in their own way, are less essential. Overall, the Baez women come off better than the men. The pacifist Joan was capable of incredible cattiness in her personal relationships, but could be generous professionally (for instance, she continued to promote Bob Dylan even after he dumped her as his lover and publicly mocked her, sometimes in song). Aside from Mimi's somewhat saintly aura, there are no villains or heroes here. Unlike the writers of the protest songs of the folk revival, Hajdu does not see things in black and white. His subjects live quite colorfully on these pages--and without apology for their shortcomings and inconsistancies.

It weighs in at less than seven pages per year, though it does not pretend to be a thorough or chronological unraveling of this off-again-on-again investigation. There is no attempt to get inside the killer's brain. The killer, Frankie Koehler, was in fact known from the outset. And when all is said and done, this cold blooded killer from Hell's Kitchen comes across as the stable fulcrum between the plodding obsessiveness of the soon-to-retire detective Andy Rosenzweig and the killer's cynically manic defense attorney, &quot;Don't Worry Murray&quot; Richman. The disparity between these two men's personalities is surreal. If there was a story in how the detective and the lawyer interacted, Gourevitch doesn't tell it. The author gives his readers glimpses of the lives of many of the key players and victims, but does not provide us with any of the texture and depth of portraiture that a truly gifted storyteller might. If John Berendt (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) is Rubens, Gourevitch is a cartoonist or quick sketch artist. He expects each gesture to speak volumes; few do. Where his brevity and superficiality pay off is in the creation of a sense of how given to chance and circumstance anyone's life is. However, to call this book an existential look at a criminal act would be more than generous. Even so, it makes you wonder how many crimes go unresolved due to lethargy, human indifference, and careerism that favors closing a case over admitting the inability to resolve it. Worth a read if you like the true crime genre and have an hour to kill.	2001-08-25

Freedman looks at the Ten Commandments (yes, he addresses ALL ten of them) in relationship to the Primary History in the Bible (the nine books from Genesis through Kings, minus Ruth). Along the way he disburses some very interesting information that will enhance Bible readers' future experience with the Bible texts: he explains the practice of &quot;the pairing of texts&quot; in the Hebrew Bible, makes compelling points about Jeremiah's relationship to the Primary History, contrasts monotheism with henotheism and monolatry, and gives a fascinating explanation of how the Hebrew divining stones, the Urim and Thummim, probably worked.<br />I've always felt Bible readers have made the mistake of elevating the Torah/Pentateuch at the expense of the rest of the Old Testament. Freedman's thesis seems to defend the integrity of the Hebrew Scriptures as a whole. He shows how the Israelites broke each of the Commandments they received in the wilderness. Not only broke them, but with minimal adjustments to sequencing, Freedman shows that they broke them in order. This breaking of the Commandments constitutes a &quot;scarlet thread&quot; that runs through the Primary History and that ultimately explains why the Israelites suffered defeat and exile at the hands of God's enemies. But there are ten commandments and only nine books in the Primary History. Which commandment does not get represented by a specfic sinful act in a book of its own is a mystery Freedman does not answer until the last chapter. The suspense makes this highly accessible scholarly work, a bit of a page-turner.<br />If you read this book and enjoy it, you might also like the equally fascinating but more ambitious &quot;Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds,&quot; by Donald Harman Akenson.	2001-08-04

I screen for two things--books that are too &quot;spiritual&quot; and books that are too &quot;Christian&quot; (&quot;Christological,&quot; to be more precise). As far as spirituality goes, I feel fully cabable of having my own spiritual or devotional response to the Psalms. I don't need books to tell me how to feel. (One of the truly amazing things about the Psalms is that they evoke different responses every time one reads them.) Nor do I need books that explain away the uglier aspects of the psalms, such as the powerful vengeance motif found in Psalm 137:8,9 (&quot;Happy are those who pay you [Babylon] back for what you have done to us--who take your babies and smash them against a rock.&quot;) Similarly, while I enjoy hearing psalms read in church and understand that part of what Christians know and believe about Jesus Christ is based on the way the first Christians read and understood the Psalms, I do not have a compelling need to see every verse of every psalm as a one-way vector pointing to Christ.<br />Sarna's book consists of a short introduction (20 pages) and commentary on a mere ten psalms (1, 8, 19, 15, 24, 30, 48, 82, 93, and 94). But as limited as this selection is, Sarna is able to introduce us to a good range of biblical themes and to equip us to continue our exploration of the Psalms on our own. Sarna is an excellent biblical scholar and the author of the Genesis and Exodus volumes in the Jewish Publication Society's Torah Commentary Series. He appreciates the psalms as ancient texts that share traits with other writings from the ancient Near East.

Autobiographies seem to fall into three categories: (1) &quot;tell it all before someone else tells on you&quot; (Billie Holiday's LADY SINGS THE BLUES), (2) &quot;getting even with one's enemies&quot; (Nancy Reagan's MY TURN), and (3) &quot;Gee, I can't believe people pay me to do what I love&quot; (Xaviera Hollander's THE HAPPY HOOKER).<br />Cynically, you could say there's a fourth category--the market-driven, &quot;strike while the iron is hot&quot; autobiography. Sosa's book probably falls into this last category, though it is presented as a &quot;Gee, I can't believe it&quot; type (but with touches of the defensiveness found in &quot;getting even&quot; types of autobiographies). Hispanic journalist Breton had done a good job of interviewing people in Sosa's life and arranging testimonials in a way that keeps Sosa's story moving. Baseball fans will probably enjoy reading what Sosa has to say about how he improved his batting technique, how he handled the disappointment of being sent back to the minor league, how he viewed his home-run competition with Mark McGwire in 1998. Young people looking for a sports hero will benefit from what Sosa (&quot;Mikey&quot; to his friends and family) has to say about loyalty to family, remembering where one comes from, learning from ones mistakes, handling gossipers and nay-sayers, believing in oneself, and giving back to one's community. People looking for a profound psychological portrait of the author or an insightful take on the business and game of baseball will be disappointed. While no-one would expect someone as guileless as Sosa to trash his teammates and fellow ballplayers, the book could have used a few more clubhouse anecdotes.	2000-11-17

In many ways it has been a community ahead of its time.<br />Author Barry Lewis is a New York native who has lived in Kew Gardens for thirty years. He teaches architecture and interior design in New York City and has contributed to a number of guide books. As a resident of the neighborhood, I was happy to come upon this nicely researched, amply illustrated, and intelligently written book on one of New York's more successful and resilient residential communities. Lewis does a good job of giving the history of the Kew Gardens and of explaining how it differed from other experiments to create residential garden communities within large cities in the early part of the twentieth century. He explains how the tone was set at the very beginning by the community's developers, Albon Man and his offspring. They sought to create a workable diversity within a harmonious whole: both commercial and residential, with both private homes and apartment buildings, and which allowed a number of architectural styles. The flavor of the community was also one of diversity (unlike its neighbor, Forest Hills, Jews and people in the performing arts were welcome from the beginning). Residents of the community will certainly enjoy reading this book. But so will students of urban planning and architecture.<br />The book includes a bibliography consisting mostly of articles cited in the text; it would have been more helpful if it also listed a few more comprehensive works on urban development and architecture. The book could also have benefited from a glossary of architectural terms, an index, and a walking tour that would take people past significant landmarks discussed in the text.	2000-11-01

If readers don't want to think about love (or wince from personal recognition), they have no one to blame but themselves. De Botton's title  serves as sufficient warning as to what this book is about. Young or old,  straight or gay, anyone who has ever submitted to the experience of falling  in love is bound to identify with either the narrator (who sounds  remarkably like the de Botton of HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE) or his  beloved, Chloe.<br />As I read this book--which includes chapters entitled  &quot;The Subtext of Seduction,&quot; &quot;Marxism,&quot; &quot;The Fear  of Happiness,&quot; &quot;Romantic Terrorism,&quot; and &quot;The Jesus  Complex&quot;--I kept puzzling over de Botton's subtitle, &quot;a  novel.&quot; Was this tack something he chose as a way of preventing  friends and family from offering advice and consolation (which are usually  self-serving and misplaced), or as a way of preventing ex-girlfriends from  seeing themselves in the relatively pleasing portrait he paints of Chloe?  Whatever his intention, he has stetched the definition of the novel in an  interesting way. The basic love story between the narrator and Chloe  travels its predictable path in an uneventful, but quirky, way. Neither  comes off as a villain or victim, though both can be quite nauseatingly  cute or petty at times. Through it all they remain convincingly human and  we are drawn into their foibles, insecurities, squabbles, and desires. In  short, they &quot;live&quot; as fictional characters. Even the narrator's  hyper-reflective attitude is not bothersome. These analytical reflections  read like diary entries; but the reader has evidence that the narrator has  the good sense not to let Chloe know how much time he spends THINKING about  his feelings for her. And it is these reflections, after all, that make the  novel such a fun and thought-provoking experience for the reader.	2000-08-17

First of all,  the &quot;Introduction,&quot; only six pages long, should have been called  a &quot;Foreword.&quot; It was clearly something de Botton had written on  another occasion or without reference to the work it was going to be  attached to. While it is interesting in its own right, it's the sort of  thing a person could read very easily while standing in the aisle of a  bookstore.<br />THE ESSENTIAL PLATO is essentially a repackaging of a public  domain work (The Quality Paperback Book Club seems to do a lot of this sort  of thing). In fairness, it presents hefty chunks of Plato's works (The  Republic and The Trial and Death of Socrates in full, plus selections from  sixteen other works). The translation is by Benjamin Jowett, first  published in 1871. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature  this was a popular translation in its day, though one that was criticized  by scholars. It's surprisingly modern and very readable. De Botton's  introduction is followed by short introductions on Plato's Life, Writings,  and Philosophy. They are uncredited, but I suspect they were authored  either by Jowett or by the editorial staff of the original publisher. Each  work has an extensive introduction of its own (also uncredited). While the  introductions seem thorough and the information they give plausible, I kept  finding myself wondering if they didn't represent &quot;old  scholarship.&quot; There are no annotations, cross-references, or any other  helps.<br />Not a rip-off exactly, but I'm sure I'm going to have to look  elsewhere for definitive editions of Plato's works.	2000-08-14

It does something I've  never been able to do when talking to friends: it articulates the value of  reading and studying literature. You don't have to have read IN SEARCH OF  LOST TIME to enjoy this book. In fact, de Botton could probably have  subsituted Joyce, Faulkner, or Woolf for Proust and produced a similar  study. The self-help format seems appropriate (even if sardonically  intended). De Botton seems to be directly addressing (and at times  challenging) the earnestness of people who turn to books to improve  themselves (and who expect books to show them the best way to improve those  around them). My favorite chapters were &quot;How to Suffer  Successfully&quot; and &quot;How to Be a Good Friend.&quot; The final  chapter, &quot;How to Put Down Books,&quot; should probably be photocopied  and stapled to the door of every library and bookstore. I cautions us  against bibliolatry.<br />One tiny gripe. De Botton does not always identify  the works he is quoting from. We don't need to know specific page numbers,  but it would be nice to know if a quotation is from one of the volumes of  IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, or from an essay or letter. In one case, I wasn't  sure if the quote was Proust's or Ruskin's.	2000-08-14

This new work put out under the auspices of the British Museum has what it takes to become THE standard desk reference on the Ancient Near East.  Entries are clear and concise (the longest run to two and a half columns).  Also, they are good about letting the reader know which archaeological and  historical issues are still matters of dispute (in other words, there seems  to be no faking of certainty). Although there are no color plates, almost  every page has a well-chosen and informative photograph or illustration.  Maps and charts are simple and easy to absorb. The editors and their staff  get major points for the quality and extent of their cross-referencing and  indexing. It's very easy to spend hours following all the interesting leads  and connections from one article to another. Many alphabatized reference  works don't even bother with an index (&quot;The Oxford Companion to  Classical Civilization&quot; is an example of a work that desperately needs  one); but, as anyone who has to do quick look-ups on the fly knows, an  index is a great asset in any single-volume desk reference  work.<br />Information the publisher should have given to Amazon.com: (1) The  definition of the Ancient Near East the editors follow is the one used by  the British Museum: Mesopotamia, Iran, Anatola, the Caucasus, the Levant  and Arabia; (2) The chronological range covered by the entries stretches  from 1.5 million years ago to the fall of Babylon to the Persian Cyrus the  Great in 539 B.C. [Yes, dates are identified as &quot;B.C.&quot;, not  &quot;B.C.E.&quot;]; (3) Besides information about the ANE that you'd  expect to find, this dictionary includes information on the discoverers as  well--the people and institutions who made significant contributions to ANE  studies. (Although I'm not qualified to judge, I suspect the Brits are  over-represented.)<br />Things I would like to see added in subsequent  editions: (1) A general introduction that give the reader some context and  background; (2) A timeline that relates what was happening in the ANE to  the growth of civilization in Egypt. (I accept the need to limit discussion  of Egypt in the individual entries, but would have appreciated a schematic  that gave me a workable overview.

I remember being startled and awakened  because I had never read a novel where the main character (Gene Forrester)  was someone who was as torn by self-doubt and envy as I knew myself to be.  Although I first read the book during the Vietnam War and the events it  describes took place during World War II, the book seemed to speak directly  to my soul. So much so, that the first diary I ever kept was in the form of  letters to Gene...because I was sure he was the only person who could  understand what I felt. I reread the novel every few years and it never  loses its power and honesty for me.<br />For years I looked in used bookstores  for a good hardcover edition to replace my tattered paperback. Thank you  Scribners for including A SEPARATE PEACE in you Scribner Classics series of  great, affordable hardcover modern classics. This is not a shoddily run off  photo-reproduction of an earlier edition. It is a beautifully typeset (and  carefully proofread) new setting.

Rick Whitaker's account of his brief stint as a sex professional servicing male clientele is an honest, if  slight (a mere 179 pages, with lots of white space) addition to this  ever-expanding body of literature. I say &quot;honest&quot; provisionally  because I believe it was Whitaker's intention to be as frank as possible.  However, as a reader, I felt I was being cast into the role of Whitaker's  therapist who was only being granted access to what Whitaker was ready to  see and reveal about himself. Although this is not exactly a sanitized  story, I couldn't help feeling that he was gingerly stepping through his  story, picking episodes that weren't too grim (he wants our approval, not  our pity) and speaking of his ex-profession in a way that is not judgmental  (like a former alcoholic, he is &quot;recovering,&quot; not  &quot;reformed&quot;). Written (&quot;collated&quot; may be the better word  here, considering the number of verbatim diary entries he includes) after  only one year away from Whitaker's last act of prostitution, the reader  senses Whitaker's lingering vulnerability--the kind of tenderness one feels  when poking a healing wound. There seems to be a plea for acceptance. I  felt--again, like a therapist might--that I wa being asked to offer him my  bottomless patience and unconditional good will. There is something a  little sad about the way Whitaker peppers his story with quotes from the  likes of Oscar Wilde and Andrew Marvell and with reminders of his love for  classical music. It feels like an appeal for us to see him as a person  who--though handsome and dionysiac--still has a mind, good taste, and  resonant soul. And in the end, it may be these touches that make his story  convincing and interesting.<br />What you won't get from ASSUMING THE POSITION  is a gleeful romp through the world of prostitution (read Hollander's THE  HAPPY HOOKER for that), a gritty sense of time and place (turn to Rechy's  CITY OF NIGHT), an insightful analysis of our society's ambivalent  attitudes toward sex and the varieties of sexuality (if this has been  written, I'd like to know about it), or a literary masterpiece (try Crane's  MAGGIE: A GIRL OF THE STREETS). What you will get is a touching portrait of  a life in transition. That we, as readers, have no clear picture of where  this life will ultimately wind up may be somewhat disconcerting.

First, let me say that I bought this book because I was frustrated with the Bible dictionaries I own when it comes to finding information on ancient rulers who are not directly mentioned in the Bible. They do a good  job, as one would expect, of putting forth as much as can be known about  kings, queens, and the queen mothers of Israel and Judah, but are weak in  giving a good overview of the neighboring kingdoms and the genealogy of  their rulers.<br />This WHO'S WHO is written by a scholar who acknowledges  that as an Assyriologist she has favored the history of Mesopotamia over  other parts of the Ancient Near East. (The few entries there are on Egypt  seem to be from the latter part of the first millennium. Routledge must  want us to buy their WHO'S WHO IN ANCIENT EGYPT.) Entries are brief (the  longest is three columns); most seem to be drawn from one or two sources,  the CAMBRIDGE ANCIENT HISTORY being the dominant English language source.  Leick chose not to provide translations of the names, probably because the  etymology of too many of them remains uncertain. She does not reveal the  basis for her English spellings which I would like to have known in case I  need to do further exploring; but I assume she follows what's used in the  CAH.<br />Where my trust in the author's expertise breaks down is with the  biblical persons she writes about. After acknowledging that the only source  for David's biography is the Bible, she writes &quot;Saul's hostility never  ceased, but his son Abner made overtures to David by marrying his sister  Micah to him.&quot; Apart from the pronominal confusion of that sentence (I  had to read it three times), there are some factual errors. According to  the biblical record, Abner was Saul's cousin, not his son (1 Sam 14:50),  and Saul's daughter who was given to David in marriage was named Michal  (I've never encountered a different spelling). Leick goes on to say that  David captured Jerusalem from the Canaanites (technically not wrong, but  &quot;from a Canaanite people called the Jebusites&quot; would have been  more precise and would have kept uninformed readers from assuming that the  Canaanites existed as a unified nation); and describes Ammon, Moab, and  Edom as Israel's &quot;western&quot; neighbors (all are east of the  Jordan/Dead Sea). It should also probably be noted that precise biblical  citations are rare in this book.<br />Things I would like to see changed or  added in a revised edition of this book: (1) include more detail in the  Chronology; (2) add dynasty or succession charts for important kingdoms;  and (3) reorient the maps (if they were turned sideways they could be  larger and easier to read). And why are the maps in the front of the book  and the Chronology in the back?

Arguably, the three great stories of the Bible are the stories of Moses, King David, and Jesus. While some of the stories in Genesis may be easier for the average person to recount (loosely) from memory, the story of King  David gets more ink from the biblical authors. With the publication of KING  DAVID: A BIOGRAPHY by Steven McKenzie and THE DAVID STORY by Robert Alter,  it looks like Israel's great king might finally be getting his due  recognition (vis-a-vis Moses and Jesus, anyway). &quot;Part of the appeal  of the David story,&quot; says McKenzie, &quot;has been the earthiness of  its plot. It reads like a modern soap opera with plenty of sex, violence,  and struggles for power. The relationships are intricate.&quot; David's  story (found primarily in 1 &amp; 2 Samuel) reads like a season of  &quot;Dallas&quot; and has inspired modern classics by the likes of William  Faulkner and Joseph Heller. Anyone who works in an office, a government  agency, or university is more likely to identify with David--or one of the  secondary characters in his narrative--than they would with Jesus. David is  as guileful as Jesus was guileless.<br />In spite of his modest claim to be  offering nothing new, McKenzie has accomplished an amazing feat. He has  organized, presented, evaluated, and summarized recent biblical scholarship  on the David story. He also discusses the scant, but intriguing,  archaeological evidence of David's reign. He is not dismissive of the  biblical record, but he deftly helps the average reader to understand the  kind of reasonable skepticism that scholars have had to adopt in order to  extract a plausible portrait of David from all the spin-doctoring the  biblical authors and editors have put on the events they describe. The  economy and clarity of McKenzie's prose and the relentless rationality of  his argumentation is gripping and persuasive. He explains why scholars find  certain texts &quot;apologetic&quot; and others more likely to reflect  events as they might actually have occurred. McKenzie takes each major  phase of David's career and methodically creates a portrait of the man.  Each chapter ends with a short summary, so the reader has a second chance  to decide for him or herself if the emerging portrait is credible. I found  McKenzie's discussion of David's confrontation with Goliath and his brief,  revisionist portrait of Bathsheba especially fascinating. The extensive  bibliography directs the ambitious reader to works of primary scholarship  (mostly in English) and to other literary treatments of the David story. To  get the most out of this book, take McKenzie's suggestion and read or  re-read the biblical texts first.as they might actually have occurred.

Roger Shattuck has provided a book that truly lives up to its subtitle: A Field Guide to In Search of Lost Time. The highly credentialed and astutely discerning author gives both the first-time reader of Proust and the  Proustian scholar useful information that will help them read, enjoy, and  plumb the depths of Proust's massive oeuvre. I count myself among the  former group, having made a number of attempts at reading In Search of Lost  Time, but always managing to stall out somewhere in the middle of Swann's  Way and then jumping around the other volumes looking for amusing  sections.<br />Although certain chapters have been previously published,  Shattuck has taken care to fully integrate them into this Field Guide, and  readers will probably be best served by reading the book from cover to  cover. Some chapters, I suspect, will be more meaningful to me after I've  read more of the novel, but the ones I found most useful as a novice  Proustian were &quot;Proust's Complaint&quot; (the &quot;clouding of the  mind at the moment of achieving what it most desires&quot;) and &quot;How  to Read a Roman-Fleuve&quot; (Check out the footnote on p. 25: it gives an  abbreviated reading plan for those who aren't ready to read the entire  3,000 page novel from beginning to end). I also found the discussions about  the English translations in the chapter on &quot;Continuing Disputes&quot;  especially fascinating.<br />Owners of the Random House/Vintage 3-volume  Rembrance of Things Past should be warned that all citations are keyed to  the 6-volume Modern Library edition of In Search of Lost Time. This is  frustrating if you want to read a passage in context, but, on the whole, is  not especially problematic since Shattuck quotes the passages that are most  germane to his arguments. The Selected Bibliography is extremely short, but  I suspect every work that made it to the list has earned Shattuck's high  regard and is worth looking into.<br />Proust's Way is a thoughtful work that  any serious reader of Proust will want to keep at his or her elbow when  reading In Search of Lost Time.that  any serious reader of Proust will want to keep at his or her elbow when  reading In Search of Lost Time.	2000-07-13

The Penguin Lives series seems to takes its inspiration from seventeenth century writers like Izaak Walton and John Aubrey who churned out brief, engaging  prose portraits of their contemporaries and other worthies. Readers know  from the moment they pick up one of the Penguin Lives that they are not  going to get a thorough-going, heavily annotated exploration of the person  under scrutiny. They also know, when they check the page count, that they  will not stall out midway and that they can easily finish it on a long  weekend at the beach. The choice of &quot;celebrity authors&quot; to do the  story-telling is also intriguing. Edmund White, for instance, may not have  the final say on all things Proustian, but as a gay novelist and biographer  of Jean Genet, we can be pretty confident that he will be forthright and  honest when discussing Proust's sexuality and careful, appreciative, and  insightful when discussing In Search of Lost Time. In fact, the balance  White strikes in his discussion of the man and the novel is quite  impressive. In contrast to many modern biographies that wallow in  unflattering detail and leave the reader wondering how the subject ever  managed to become a person worthy of being written about, White gives us a  sense of what Proust was up against (personally and emotionally) without  diminishing what he achieved. One piece of advice, if you do decide to buy  this great little volume: Don't skip the bibliography. It's only nine pages  long and White's descriptions of the books listed will point you toward  some good reading (and away from some duds).	2000-07-04

Somehow, I managed to get through high school and college without ever seriously reading any of the great Western philosophers. The Consolations of Philosophy is an excellent introduction and quick (I mean,QUICK)  overview of six of these men. The deadwhitemales discussed are Socrates,  Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. The discussion is  lively and thought-provoking--and amusingly illustrated. This book would  serve as an excellent secondary text for an introduction to philosophy  course. Even the most jaded undergraduate will want to learn more about the  teachings of the philosophers covered. I found the chapters on Seneca  (&quot;Consolation for Frustration&quot;), Montaigne (&quot;Consolation for  Inadequacy&quot;), and Nietzsche (&quot;Consolation for Difficulties&quot;)  the most engaging and challenging. De Botton's writing and thinking are  fresh and remind me, for some reason, of the cultural essays of Susan Bordo  (and Camille Paglia in her more reasonable moments).	2000-06-22

On the surface, A Disgraceful Affair is Bianca Lamblin's account of her brief triangular relationship with Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre and how that affair affected her life long after Sartre's, then Beauvoir's,  romantic interest waned. Its carefully guarded sentences reveal a woman who  has been deepley hurt by her mentors but who is being painstakingly careful  in her effort to be fair as she sets the record straight. Readers looking  for juicy tidbits will need to look elsewhere (Lamblin describes Sartre as  a charming wooer but an unskilled lover, and does not waste ink  elaborating).<br />If the reader takes the facts as the author presents  them--and there is nothing implausible or erractic in what Lamblin  relates--what unfolds is a brief, startlingly clear reflection on what it  means to evolve one's own workable philosophy of life based on the cards  one is dealt and the living examples one has to choose from. After her  rejection by her existentalist mentors, Lamblin consciously chose a  conventional, slightly leftist, life. Her mentors' narcissism seems to have  turned her away from a life focused on pursuing celebrity and getting  published (aside from a few academic philosophy articles, A Disgraceful  Affair is Lamblin's only published work, one she didn't begin writing until  she was in her seventies and all the key figures in the story had died).  Unlike her mentors, she chose to marry and have children, decisions that  disturbed and disgusted Beauvoir.<br />Those looking for portraits of Sartre  and Beauvoir should know that Beauvoir (unfortunately called &quot;the  Beaver&quot; throughout the book, a nickname that might have been better  left untranslated) is the more fully realized. Lamblin renewed her  relationship with Beauvoir after the War and continued to have platonic  meetings with her for the rest of Beauvoir's life. Lamblin's depiction of  Beauvoir's life after Sartre's death is one of profound pathos and  emotional disenfranchisement. By that point, Beauvoir's alcoholism was  quite advanced and the reader senses that the great thinker and prolific  writer's death must have been a lonely, troubled, and confusing end  indeed.<br />The reader should be warned that there is a sort of craftlessness  to Lamblin's writing. For me, this added to the sense of authenticity of  what she was attempting to communicate. She often tells the reader what she  is going to say--or why she is relating a particular incident--before  launching into her account of an event. This tends to pull the reader up  short. As off-putting as this might be, for me it further convinced me of  the author's essential guilelessness and I ultimately judged this practice  as awkward but not offensive. In addition, I suspect that Julie Plovnick's  translation of the French original is a little wooden and literal-minded  (for instance, she translates &quot;lucide&quot; as &quot;lucid&quot; in a  context where I suspect &quot;perceptive&quot; might have been the intended  meaning).<br />Readers interested in the way people, and especially women,  make meaning of the troubles life throws their way will enjoy this book.  Other books along this line that I have enjoyed are Girl Interrupted by  Susanna Kaysen, The Liar's Club by Mary Karr, and A Loving Gentleman: The  Love Story of William Faulkner and Meta Carpenter by Meta Carpenter Wilde  and Orin Borsten.isement.

US	50086375	RCQZV8WVW3H53	0486404382	504200942	Tartuffe and the Bourgeois Gentleman (Dual-Language) (English and French Edition)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Excellent resource for people learning French	Translator Stanley Appelbaum has done an excellent job of preparing a readable, but reasonably literal translation of two very different but often-performed plays by Moliere. And his brief introduction gives  sufficient background to help the reader jump into the reading of the  plays. I chose this edition as a way to brush up on my college French prior  to my trip to Paris, so I especially appreciated having the French and  English on facing pages with each line perfectly lined up. The generous  white space around the text was great for taking notes. Sometimes the  simplest book designs are the best! Kudos to Dover Press.	2000-05-22
