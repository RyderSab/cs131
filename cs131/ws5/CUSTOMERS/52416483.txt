US	52416483	R1I8L21J8NHTHF	1590593561	267967323	Dive Into Python	Books	5	61	64	N	Y	Great Book for Experienced Programmers	If you've never programmed before, Python is an excellent language to learn modern programming techniques. But this book should not be your starting point. Get \\"How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python\\" by Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner, Chris Meyers and learn the basics. Then dive into this book.    Mark Pilgrim is an extremely accessible author. He teaches by example. Each chapter teaches powerful techniques and Python idioms by creating a useful program. Anybody with programming experience should be able to follow the examples and learn the language - although a few visits to the Python website docs may help along the way.    Each example is brief and annotated. The annotations combine with explanatory text to reveal the power of this incredible programming language. Python runs on virtually any popular platform and can be downloaded for free. Mark's excellent work will help empower the reader to do useful things almost immediately.     One of the early example programs reads through a directory of MP3 files and lists the header information, such as artist, album, etc. This is accomplished with just a few lines of code.     Mark makes the point that everything in Python is an object. While this is not a text on hard-core object oriented programming, it is an excellent opportunity for the OOP beginner to get a handle on it.    Pilgrim also emphasizes good programming techniques, such as documentation and unit testing. In one of the later chapters he even creates a Python unit testing framework that works for testing Python code to see if it performs as expected. Again, this example is annotated, used to develop both the software engineering skill of unit testing AND properties of the Python language.    He also covers accessing websites and parsing HTML and XML code. This is just an introduction to these subjects. Those interested in learning this in depth will want to continue their reading with other books and web pages focused on these topics.The book is not dry or boring. It is not a manual. It is an excellent example of how to use the language AND how to think like a master programmer. The latter is reason enough to buy the book even if you're familiar with Python and have been coding for years.    It's a fun read. It's a great second book for somebody learning to program. It's a powerful example for those wishing to improve their programming style and/or learn object programming. I cannot say enough good things about it.     Furthermore, Mark maintains a website and blog. His articles vary from technically dense to enticingly interesting. He's even responded to email I sent him. How many authors do that?    If you found your way to this page, GET THE BOOK! Being here is proof that it's a good match for you. And if you just want to learn to program and have no experience - get the book anyway, then get a more basic book to go with it. DIVE INTO PYTHON will make you a quality programmer if you work your way through it.	2005-05-19

We protect our little darlings from anything that might be frightening. But children know better. They know about the monster under the bed and the reasons not to be alone in the dark. They KNOW, and when we adults tell them that \\"there's nothing to be worried about\\" they KNOW that we're no help.<br />Neil Gaiman and David McKean have offered children of all ages the gift of knowledge--in this wonderful volume comes the knowledge that at least SOME adults KNOW what can lurk in the unknown.<br />In this story, the adults (and even the kid brother) are SO wrong about what lurks within the walls, but Lucy, the hero, KNOWS. She plays the part of a child in a fairy tale, leading the \\"knowing\\" adults to KNOWLEDGE, and finally to overcoming their fears and setting things right.<br />The illustrations buttress the message of this neo-fairy tale and increase the delight of reading it or having it read to you. Impactful, but not so dark as stories where witches want to pop plump children into their ovens.<br />All my kids, their friends, and my friends who are children at heart LOVE this book. Buy it already!!!	2004-01-10

If you haven't got the faintest clue about middleware when you start reading, you'll find yourself half-drowned, bedraggled, and nearly as clueless when you finish. A truly \\"Complete Book of Middleware\\" ought to at least have a chapter that orients the reader to middleware--that way we know which acronyms to duck and which to glom on to!<br />This seems to be quite the shotgun approach to middleware. Make that a fully automatic shotgun with a large magazine. From Java to CORBA to specific vendors and program scripts, Ms. Myerson manages to cover a lot of ground, sometimes deeply, sometimes shallowly, and mostly with acronyms. I useful (?) overview, but one that will leave the reader wanting to buy more focused books to solve real life problems--or run out to hire a consultant who knows it all anyway.<br />I found several chapters quite relevant to a project I'm currently working on--although they mostly describe why current business solutions are inadequate to solve our particular problem. I also found that the relevant chapters demanded that I purchase more books so that I could leverage what I had read into real information.<br />So, know a bit about middleware _before_ you get this book. Then, if you need a description of (nearly) current systems and approaches that covers vast amounts of acreage, give this one a shot to see where you need to focus your reading--but plan on buying other books.<br />This is not \\"The Complete Book of Middleware,\\" it's a modestly broad-based and exhausting introduction to what's out there and what it does.	2003-03-11

The author presents enough safety information to be reasonable, and mixes in scientific explanations, a bit of math, and interesting anectdotes that take us back into the history of ballistics. But most of all, he presents details plans and parts lists (including sources for hard to find parts) to build things that shoot up into the air, things that go \\"BOOM,\\" and other cool stuff like fire kites.<br />Many of the projects described here are also well documented on the internet. But most internet postings have little to say about safety, science, or history. Using this book as a starting point, and the internet as a resource to expand the ideas, could lead one to develop a truly interesting ballistic arsenal indeed!!<br />Before we had homeland security to worry about, this might have been a good source book for a science fair. Now, it just might be a great way to spend a lifetime behind bars. But, if you're in touch with your inner Goddard, von Braun, or just love the idea of a tennis ball mortar ... then this is the book for you!	2003-03-05

This story enthralls almost immediately, about a father and his two children taking refuge from The Big City in a safe, rural setting. Anthony builds empathy for the plight of the family, who have just lost their mother to NY crime. But as he does this, he begins to insert elements into the rural Florida setting that don't quite fit, that can be explained away at first, but then ...<br />I won't give anything away, but this could have made a great X-Files episode. Anthony demonstrates that he can run with King or Straub with this story. His characterization is much deeper than usual, but he doesn't neglect his perversely creative ability to plot beyond the lines.<br />Great bedtime reading for city dwellers. Not certain I'd read it at all if I lived in an old house under an old tree, miles from anywhere ...	2003-02-22

Others provide unsupervised children with recipes for disaster. The book should come with a child-proof cover or a trigger-lock. Not that it contains plans for thermonuclear devices, but several of the projects can damage property or cause injury if not properly carried out.<br />While each project has a set of fascinating \\"scientific\\" tidbits & trivia to go with it, the book is almost entirely lacking in helping children understand or use the scientific method or understand much of the basis for what they are doing. This is a \\"Mad Scientists' Club\\" handbook, just a several steps short of the Anarchists' Cookbook, but headed in that general direction. <br />On the other hand, parents may find themselves reliving their own nerdy & awkward years helping their children be \\"mad scientists.\\" It could be great fun. But keep the book locked up. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing!	2002-12-29

It's not bad, as far as it goes, but at [$$$]/page it's grossly overpriced! The 20 pages include a \\"poster\\" (8 1/2 x 11, which copyright forbids blowing up to a larger size) and a number of worksheets. Mighty slim pickings.<br />As an experienced teacher of anger management, I've developed a strong curriculum for a 10 week class series (well over 100 pages of class notes, nearly 20 pages of handouts and exercises). I found some ideas in this book I could incorporate into my work--but I was extremely disappointed at how little material it includes.<br />On the positive side, there is enough material here to teach children and teens about how to manage their anger. The authors have worked hard to incorporate learning activities that instruct different modalities (visual, verbal, aural, kinesthetic, etc.). A creative teacher could use this material effectively. I'm not overly impressed, but if you have to teach an anger management class to children or teens, it's better than having nothing.	2002-12-29

It was a day I expected to spend six hours in the air and several standing in lines. I had had no sleep the previous night. I felt like my only cerebral activity was sustained by caffeine.<br />Seven Up was the perfect book at the perfect time. Quirky characters, unusual situations, a streak of self-conscious &quot;naughtiness&quot; (without being offensive), made it funny and kept it interesting. None of the characters seemed particularly deep, and I wasn't left at the end trying to demythologize the text in order to garner meaning. By the time I reached my destination, I had turned all the pages and was wearing a contented smile.<br />I just gave it to my wife, the day after she had completed a huge research project and paper. As she started to read, she said &quot;Oh, yeah, this is like Sue Grafton.&quot; Sure it was. Thirty minutes later I commented that I had never heard her laughing so much at Grafton. She agreed. <br />Other reviewers have complained about how formulaic this book is. I don't know, I haven't read the previous six, or the following one. I do know, that on its own it was delightful and entertaining. I think I'll start tracking down the other books in the series and play catch-up.<br />This isn't a thriller, it isn't a farce. It parodies the &quot;expected&quot; role of women in society without pedanticism. It treads on the teats of many a sacred cow, gleefully. It's a yarn, told through the eyes of a character I wish I could number in my circle of friends.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue further about this book or review, please click the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

The last coin lies somewhere in Southern California, and Andrew Bergen, a foolish, but likeable loser is its unwitting caretaker. <br />In this unlikely setting, Blaylock unfolds a realist-fantasy of subtle humor and adventures that don't quite cross over the border into farce. Populated with such delightful obscurities of American culture as Wheetabix (used to be Ruskets, no sugar added, got mushy real fast) cereal and a Nash Metropolitan, the novel delights as much with trivial backdrops as with plot and character.<br />The plot unfolds as a competition between the court jester (Bergen) and the evil magus (Pennyman). Thinking himself a great schemer, Bergen's innocence keeps getting him into misadventures that slowly advance and unfold the plot. Pennyman, meanwhile, acts directly, and with Knowledge. Although he sees through Bergen, cannot fathom his behavior, and therein lies the possibility of saving the world.<br />Quirky. Adventurous. More fun than a barrel full of hobbits. A must read unless your fantasy just =HAS= to be populated with dragons, orcs, and the like. ...	2002-06-17

Greater minds than mine awarded it a Pulitzer Prize, so I won't blabber on about its quality. Wilder wastes few words, inserts no extra padding, to tell his story. This lacks the action sequences and suspense of Tom Clancyish pulp, but does sneak up on the intellect, leaving the reader expectantly looking for the subtle connections that weave the characters together. <br />The manifest story is simple. Five people have fallen to their death in Peru, and Brother Juniper seeks to prove the goodness of God by evaluating their lives to demonstrate exactly why bad things happen. Gently satirical, Wilder consigns poor Brother Juniper to a fitting end, for the chutzpah of attempting to decipher the mind of God with a moral calculus. Juniper has forgotten his Master's admonition, to \\"judge not.\\" Hidden from Juniper's attempt to make sense of tragedy lay connections that he could never imagine, longings, love unrequited, and loneliness unimaginable. In the end, we learn, not WHY bad things happen, but the power and beauty that can rise from the ashes of tragedy.<br />Wilder tells snippets of stories, weaving lives together, in a way that goes unnoticed at first, then becomes subliminal, and finally explodes into consciousness at the end. While these lives and their interconnections are somewhat contrived, they effect a transformation, both of the story-line and the reader by the end of the book. Well worth reading a second time.<P...	2002-06-09

This period of history ignored by most Americans, was a crucial moment in the history of Western Civilization. Fisher, recognizing the battle between Democracy and the Fascist powers, ignored the wishes of his family and volunteered to fight in Spain, supporting the democratically elected government there against the Nazi supported military rebellion of Franco.<br />War is hell, but getting to the battlefield was no easy matter. Not only did the United States refuse to aid the Spanish government, it actively sought to block American citizens from opposing the fascists and Hitler's nascent military machine. (this at a time when Henry Ford and Prescott Bush (our \\"president's\\" grandpa) were raking money in supplying the Nazis). Fisher finally made it to Spain.<br />The book relates comradeship, sudden death, misery, deprivation, and the courage that can only come from putting your life on the line for a cause you desperately believe in. Fisher relates anecdotes in a soft, gentle, personable manner. <br />This book can be compared with Orwell's Homage to Catalonia. Orwell spends more time with political analysis and historical background. His style is less personal, and somewhat harsher. Fisher brings in his family, his hopes, his fears, but leaves the greater political context largely unexplored. Both books are five-star-must-reads. <br />After reading Comrades, I again had to wonder, \\"What might have happened if America had acted as a Democracy instead of a Capitalist Oligarchy and officially backed the legitimate Spanish government? Even weapons sales might have enabled the forces of Democracy to prevail ... and taught Hitler and Mussolini that the Democracies would not stand idly by while they attempted to subdue the world.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review in more detail, click on the \\"about me\\" link above and drop me an email.

At 86 pages, it looks to be a short, fast read. It isn't. (I started reading in Anchorage, continued reading during an hour layover in Seattle, and finished about 20 minutes before arriving in LA!) Bookchin stakes out his reasons for writing the first essay in a &quot;note to the reader&quot; that begins with:<br />&quot;Anarchists have formed neither a coherent program nor a revolutionary organization to provide a direction for the mass discontent that contemporary society is creating. Instead, this discontent is being abosrbed by political reactionaries and channeled into hostility toward ethnic minorities, immigrants, and the poor and marinal, such as single mothers, the homeless, the elderly, and even environmentalists, who are being depicted as the principal sources of contemporary social problems ... Thousands of self-styled anarchists have slowly surrendered the social core of anarchist ideas to the all-pervasive Yuppie and New Age personalism that marks this decadent, bourgeosified era.&quot; (p. 1)<br />He goes on to point out that:<br />&quot;The various oppressions that [capitalism] inflicts upon society have been grossly imputed to the impact of 'technology,' not the underlying social relationships between capital and labor, structured around an all-pervasive marketplace economy that has penetrated into every sphere of life, from culture to friendships and family.&quot; (p. 2)<br />Looking back to the roots of anarchism (Emma Goldman, the Wobblies), he decries:<br />&quot;They demanded a revolution -- a _social_ revolution --  without which these aesthetic and psychological goals could not be achieved for humanity as a whole ... regrettably, this revolutionary endeavor, indeed the high-minded idealism and class consciousness on which it rests, is central to fewer and fewer of the self-styled anarchists I encounter today.&quot; (p 3)<br />Bookchin then launches into his first essay,dedicating 52 pages to attacking what he calls Lifestyle Anarchism and then five pages to Social Anarchism. This annoys me more than anything else. I would much rather have seen a balanced treatment, spending another 50 some pages to outline his vision of Social Anarchism. The heart of his polemics seems to be attacking the substitution of an egoistic, undisciplined, do-your-own-thing mentality for solidarity and revolutionary commitment. He takes issue with those who promote an &quot;individualism&quot; unconnected with community, noting that the individual arises out of, is nurtured by, and co-creates with community. He assails those who promote anarchism as mere chaos. Similarly, he goes after those who would take refuge in mysticism at the expense of social analysis and concrete revolutionary commitment. He refutes those who see &quot;technology&quot; as THE problem, demonstrating that neo-ludditism is no substitute for a rational anarchy. (Had he read Rianne Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade, he might have picked up some even more powerful arguments here.) <BR>He concludes that:<br />&quot;A bourgeois reality whose economic harshness grows starker and crasser with every passing day is shrewdly mutated by lifestyle anarchism into constellations of self-indulgence, inchoateness, indiscipline, and incoherence.&quot; (p. 51)<br />&quot;To malign civilization without due recognition of its enormous potentialities for _self-conscious_ freedom -- a freedom conferred by reason as well as emotion, by insight as well as desire, by prose as well as poetry -- is to retreat back into the shadowy world of brutishness, when thought was dim and intellecuation was only an evolutionary promise.&quot; (p. 56)<br />In the next five pages he briefly sketches out his ideas of a Democratic Communalism. He yearns for a sharing of power in face-to-face collective meetings, for an anarchism that stays connected to its Enlightenment roots. He wants an anarchism that: &quot;is committedto rationality, while opposing the rationalization of experience; to technology, while opposing the 'megamachine;' to social institutionalization, while opposing class rule and hierarchy; to a genuine politics based on the confederal coordination of municipalities or communes&quot; (p. 57)  and warns that &quot;if a left-libertarian vision is not to disappear ... it must offer a resolution to social problems, not flit arrogantly from slogan to slogan, shielding itself from rationality with bad poetry and vulgar graphics.&quot; (p. 57)<br />His second essay (about 20 pages), The Left that Was, offers a nice primer on the &quot;traditional&quot; Left from an anarchist perspective. This essay alone was worth the price of the book. He makes a final appeal: &quot;What this society usually does should not deter leftists from probing the logic of events from a rational standpoint or from calling for what society _should_ do. Any attempt to adapt the rational 'should' to the irrational 'is' vacates that space on the political spectrum that should be occupied by a Left premised on reason, freedom, and ecological humanism.&quot; (p. 86)<br />(If you'd like to further discuss this review or book, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

Books	5	24	41	N	Y	Lighting the Darkness with Laughter - Comedic Propaganda	Michael Moore is back, and this piece of comedic propaganda is at least as enjoyable as anything else he's ever done. Don't confuse Stupid White Men with solid, \\"neutral\\" journalism (which the corporate media hasn't given us for years, if ever). While he provides references at the end of the book to support his outlandish claims, he never lets the facts interfere with telling a good story. And this one is a whopper-unfortunately, it's not fiction. It's just a way of laughing at a grim reality that most Americans live with and never notice. <br />This is just plain fun for dissidents and malcontents, but it shouldn't be confused with Noam Chomsky. Moore makes us laugh at the nonsense we have tolerated, even as we cinch our yokes tighter to shoulder the increasing burdens being placed on our backs. This rabble rousing is a necessary function when the number of American flags on bumpers and antennae exceeds the number of vehicles on the American roads. It is a necessary function when voter turn-out is setting record lows. Moore reminds us not to get so caught up in \\"patriotic\\" flag waving that we forget to mind the chicken coop-our \\"elected\\" foxes are robbing us blind.<br />Moore tackles a wide range of issues. The first chapter details The Bush Coup of 2000 and what we, the defrauded electorate can do about it. In the second chapter he lists damage that the unelected Bush has already done to the nation. Chapter three exposes the disparity between corporate wealth and individual poverty (it's enough to make Adam Smith hang his head in shame). Chapter four raises the issues of racism, using humor (\\"Kill Whitey\\") and suggests what both white and black people can do to really improve things. The next chapter goes on to examine why Americans know so much about \\"meaningless\\" statistics (batting averages and football scores) while being clueless about how they are being oppressed and ripped off-it also honors teachers, points out the stupidity of some school regulations andhas an action list on \\"How to be a Student Subversive instead of a Student Subservient.\\" <br />Chapter six is entitled, \\"Nice Planet, Nobody Home,\\" and is about the social and political hypocrisy towards environmental issues. The seventh chapter examines gender issues by pondering \\"The End of Men.\\" Chapter eight presents America as \\"Number One,\\" but this is a shameful thing, as it includes being first in per capita energy consumption, in imprisonment, in hazardous waste production, and in the likelihood of children under the age of fifteen to die from gunfire! Chapter nine pokes fun at the prison-industrial complex, noting that 1 American in 140 is currently in prison, a higher rate than any other nation! Ten examines what's gone wrong with the Democratic Party, and includes a \\"hit list\\" of Democrats to remove from office as well as a list of vulnerable Republicans. Eleven, the final chapter, is a \\"People's Prayer,\\" a humorous request to the Almighty to \\"Afflict the Comfortable,\\" which includes praying for Jesse Helms to be kissed on the lips by a man, that Roman Catholic Bishops get pregnant, and that racists awaken as black people. <br />He wraps up with an Epilogue about meeting Jeb Bush and the closing days of the Florida campaign. Notes and sources get their own section. Although the book is not footnoted, the sources for his information are traceable. His acknowledgements section begins with:<br />\\"I hope you had a few good laughs. I hope it has inspired you to go and raise a ruckus. Your are the only ones who are going to change things. Promise me that you won't just put this book down and go back to playing solitaire on your computer or checking your E-mail for the tenth time today.\\" (p. 275)<br />And he's right. There's no sense crying about the way things are, no sense burying our heads in the sand, no sense getting lost in despair or getting too caught up in making a living to change things. Mike's reminder to laugh at the quirks, inconsistencies, hypocrisies, and stupidities is an act of liberation. Laughing, snickering, or guffawing and passing the humor on is powerfully subversive to those who take seriously the job of fleecing the public.<br />Highly recommended, regardless of your political ideology. If you lean left, perhaps this will push you a bit further. If you lean right, this will annoy you, but you owe yourself the favor of trying to refute it ... seriously! Five stars for Moore's ability to bring scorn to bear on unjust social structures and dishonest politicians. <br />...	2002-05-04

It's chock full of inspiring stories illustrating how environmental action can succeed. It's weak on establishing either a philosophy or political theory for environmental action, and has little concrete advice for organizing. The writing style flows nicely and is not difficult. This would be a great book for a Jr. High/High School level environmental club to read and discuss.<br />Although not systematically organized, most of his stories illustrate useful strategies for environmental action, such as:<br />&quot;We only need to provide people with the facts that enable them to make up their own minds and empower them to act on their decisions. We need to be savvy, but we don't need to employ scare tactics and misleading information to communicate our message.&quot; (p. 218)<br />He provides a number of examples of corporate greed gone haywire, such as the Pacific Lumber story (p. 118), the cost of timber roads in our National Forests (p. 208), and the impact of Wallmart (p. 247+). <br />His stories are entertaining and informative, even at his own expense. It's a great book to read between something by Ruether and something by Bookchin--a light break between heavies.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review in more depth, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email.

He never allows the orthodoxy of his experience to cement. As dissatisfaction creeps in, he pays attention. New wine bursts his old wineskins and he repeatedly walks away from everything he has \\"achieved\\" into the void.<br />Siddhartha braves emptiness, daring asceticism, pleasure, nature; he wonders, he denies, he accepts. In the end ... well, if the secret could be distilled in 1000 words or less, Hesse wouldn't have needed 152 pages ... but in the end, Siddhartha has journeyed yet gone nowhere, he has abandoned everything and discovered the illusion that is the secret ... or has he?<br />This translation by Rosner flows smoothly enough that I didn't even stop to think that Hesse didn't write in English. Hesse's language is concise. This is a tight novel without a lot of scene description. Hesse wrote from the third person without stream-of-consciousness; even from this detached perspective, he draws us into Siddhartha's mind.<br />An excellent and classic work. If you already know just what spirituality is all about, if you have all the answers, then don't waste your time on this book. If you still have room for questions and growth, then I'll bet you'll revel in Siddhartha.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review further, please click on the \\"about me\\" link above & drop me an email.

I found in Full Exposure a wonderful, sex-positive volume, melding philosophy, apologetics, and personal anecdotes. I enjoy Susie Bright's casting the burden of proof onto the naysayers, requiring that the repressed and the frightened justify their censorious dogma. And when they try, she shoots them down, like beer cans lined up on the back fence.<br />She does, after all, write about (a fantasy of) making love to Dan Quayle ... reading that was the most I'd ever appreciated the man--and this leads to one of her _dogmas_: &quot;Assume everybody is sexual.&quot;<br />This is not a heavyweight philosophical deconstruction of the sexual attitudes of western society, but it is a nice guerilla attack on the sexual terrorism embedded in our culture. Susie encourages the readers to roll their own sexual manifestos, to question the manipulative &amp; schizophrenic messages that we receive about sexuality, sensuality, and our bodies from the culture around us.<br />A wonderful book to read if you're engaged in sexual liberation, whether from a sex-hating religion or from the commercial cooption of sexuality that constantly bombards us. A great starting point for your own sexual revolution!<br />(If you'd like to discuss this review or book in more depth, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; send me an email.

Photographs cannot capture their essence. Science wrestled with an adequate explanation. At the turn of the century, Kristian Birkeland used the latest technology to observe and measure auroral phenomena. His theories so astonished the scientific community that they were rejected outright. Not until fifty years later did satellite data confirm that Birkeland had gotten it mostly right.<br />Kristian Birkeland was a bright and driven man, not afraid to implement his ideas, and persuasive enough to gather backing for them. He developed a number of industrial processes. Members of his team died &amp; became disabled, battling the elements to extract knowledge.<br />Lucy Jago tells his story well. She puts the reader into blizzards and hardship. She amazes us with the bull-headed denial of the British scientists who refused to consider Birkeland's theories, in spite of the evidence he provided. She helps us feel the growing isolation of this driven man.<br />The book is based on primary historical sources, as well as secondary works. Jago opted not to clutter the text with footnotes, but provided a solid bibliography.<br />Jago's book reminds us of an era when science was dangerous and uncertain. Research didn't take place in multi-billion dollar government laboratories. Funding was even more uncertain then than now. Kristian Birkeland had tremendous drive, courage and charisma--and Jago makes this available to us.<br />At a deeper level, Birkeland's story challenges readers to examine their own lives. Birkeland's theory, one paid for in blood, was rejected by scientific peers because they could not open their minds wide enough to accept surprising information. Today we call this denial. We are left to ponder which truths we deny because they would disrupt our comfortable status quo.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review further, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email.

Understanding this connection is crucial if we're to be able to live together and to live with ourselves. We must learn to feel how other people connect to one another and to the universe.&quot; (Preface)<br />After completing his internship, Hammerschlag joined the Indian Health Service and began a personal and professional journey in the Southwest. Although he thought he was bringing his healing skills to impoverished people who would be grateful for his gifts, he had no conscious clue that he had chosen a place for his own healing. <br />Weaving together stories of the brutal destruction of Native American culture by the &quot;White Man&quot; with vignettes and reflections, Hammerschlag suggests a paradigm that goes beyond Western medicine, pronouncing that true healing is impossible without a connection to community, to spirit, and to the land. He compares the work of his mentors, Milton Erickson and Eric Fromm, with Native American healing and spiritual traditions. His journey led him to discover that the keys to healing are to be found, not in some magical external repository, but within the patient her/himself: <br />&quot;Patients are the principal agents in their lives, and as much as they want to be well, they want peace and understanding.&quot; (p. 137)<br />&quot;All of us have the keys to our own enlightenment. The therapist uses whatever symbols mean something to that patient. Patients already have the answers to their questions. As the therapist listens to the problem, the patient will also tell the solution.&quot; (p. 140)<br />An excellent book, full of powerful stories and brilliant reflections. A must read for anybody interested in personal growth, in helping others, or in the healing process. Details about the abuse of Native Americans may prompt even the most detached narcissists into caring action.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review in more detail, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

The line which gets drawn between pornography and erotica seems to be a line between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" culture, between bourgeois expressions of sexuality and proletarian. <br />I draw a line between writing, no matter how sexual or explicit, that tells a good story, that challenges my mind and emotions, that reveals character and gives me a new window on human nature (and thus myself); and writing that falls short of this standard. For me, most stories in this collection fall into the first category. Some had me turning pages, wondering what might happen next, others, like trying to catch on to a folk-tune, offered little challenge to the imagination. <br />The story settings ranged from \\"normal\\" twentieth century western culture to cyber-punk, swords-and-sorcery, and mythic. I found most characters interesting and compelling, even when involved in sexual activities that seemed to hold no appeal to me at all. But that, perhaps, is a misstatement--the erotic intensity of the stories, was always appealing, even when it lay significantly outside the bounds of what I think I would like to experience. One story actually turned my stomach a bit, but it was so compelling, I had to finish it. Once I did, I was glad to _HAVE_ read it. <br />This is the second book in the series I have read. Compared with THE BEST AMERICAN EROTICA OF 2001, this book is harder core, farther out, more cutting edge. The 2001 book is softer, gentler, more \\"normal.\\" I loved both of them, but wonder if the nature of erotica has (d)evolved so much over four years, or if Susie Bright has shifted that much.<br />Highly recommended, especially for those who would like to expand their erotic horizons from the safety of their own homes. Daring. Stimulating. Powerful. Earns every one of five stars.<br />...	2001-12-13

(For Dummies (Computers))	Books	4	38	41	N	N	Excellent Starting Point	The last time I worked with databases, my entire computer (RAM + mass storage) had less than one MEGAbyte of memory. No hard disk, just two 360 kB floppy disk drives and 128K of RAM. I just got saddled with a data-mining project that will process tens of gigabytes of data in a networked environment. My analysis tools can use SQL to access the data. This book was the first thing I insisted on. (Kind of embarassing for a senior person to be seen carrying a thick yellow and black book with the word &quot;DUMMIES&quot; on it ...)<br />This has proven to be an excellent starting point. I know plenty about computers and programming. I vaguely remember the essentials of relational databases (for those who don't, basic information is in the book, it should be enough to get started, even if you are absolutely ignorant!) Taylor packaged enough of the right information that I could read his book over the weekend and dive into the planning stages of our project on Monday sounding like I knew a thing or two. <br />The book charts a course from the most basic elements of databases to modestly complicated database and query materials. The author discusses common pitfalls and useful strategies. This book isn't enough, by itself, to turn somebody into a database wonk, but it's a great starting point.<br />I got a bit annoyed by some of the &quot;cute&quot; material used to make the subject seem less threatening, but that filler doesn't take up too much space and is easily skipped. Also, the book is overly Microsoft centered--the author uses Windows applications as examples and champions Microsofts ODBC. A section about using SQL in a Unix/Linux environment should have been included (access from shell scripts, PERL, etc?). A solid four-star introduction to SQL and database technology in a Microsoft world.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review in more detail, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me some email.

Short stories such as these, with no erotic content, would qualify for inclusion in a literary volume of quality short stories. This book explores human nature from many different perspectives, and on that single basis, is an interesting book.<br />The erotic content only serves to allow readers to explore a part of human nature that is rarely discussed, except in clinical terms, demonized with a broad brush by those who fear it, caricatured by pornographers, or lampooned by comedians. Each author does a masterful job of illuminating feelings, experiences, and desires that generally remain hidden in Society's shadow.<br />Some of the works are quite tittilating, others, shocking. Of course, that's a statement which tells more about me than about the book. Those seeking a blow by blow description of sex acts would do better with the latest issue of Penthouse. But if you'd like to explore human sexuality, to be teased, to push the envelope of the bourgeouis boudoir, then give this book a chance.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review further, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

Gabrielle Roth's book serves as a useful adjunct to those paths that honor the body, rather than ignoring or minimizing it. For the atheists and agnostics out there, this book can also be used at a psychological level, and does not necessitate belief in &quot;prayer&quot; as a sacrament. In the book Roth presents five archetypal rhythms that help break some of the self-destructive patterns of Western culture and re-unite the practitioner with his or her spirit.<br />Roth begins the book with a brief autobiography, which also serves to establish her bona fides for writing a work on the spiritual/psychological use of dance and movement. She challenges the Western dismemberment of flesh from soul, body from spirit, she reclaims the chthonic and carnal. &quot;The soul can only be present when body and spirit are one; it cannot breathe, exist, or move disconnected from the body.&quot; (p. 4) This book is her testimony to how we can retrieve our souls through our bodies.<br />Roth introduces the idea of the dance as a spiritual practice. She gives examples from her own life, challenges a list of excuses (I hate my body ... I'm too old ... I'm too shy). Then she offers &quot;the only dance lesson you'll ever need:&quot; Everybody has to find their own way, in their own time/space constraints to practice. She reminds us that &quot;life is rhythm&quot; and we need only participate in that rhythm consciously to be dancing, to be re-weaving body and soul. She then offers five concepts to help prepare for doing the rhythms: 1) That the goal is to move, to experience, not to complete something; 2) Dance happens in space, between things, between people, between worlds; 3) Awareness is the key element of dance, by paying attention to the body in rhythm, we alter consciousness and manifest our souls; 4) Follow your breath, let your breath move you; 5) Choose music that speaks to you and makes you aware of the five rhythms that make up Roth's &quot;Wave&quot;.<br />She presents the five basic rhythms (flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical, and stillness) and links them to primal archetypes. She has created glyphs/symbols for these links, and invites the reader to create their own. Each of the five rhythms gets its own chapter, detailing ideas linking the rhythm to archetypes, body, soul, and heart. Roth explains well, providing compelling examples to illustrate her points. Each chapter has exercises (&quot;To Do/Not Do&quot;) as well as a list of words that elicit the archetypes for Roth. Poetry and quotations sprinkle through each chapter.<br />Roth concludes with a chapter called &quot;Waves&quot; where she presents examples of the five rhythms that go beyond dance, examining among others experiences of the subway, relationships, and architecture. Some examples are hers, others come from friends and students. The book provides contact information for the author, as well as video and CD resources.<br />Roth does an entertaining job of describing a spiritual/psychological physical practice as well as a state of being that has tremendous potential to enhance life. I have worked with her rhythms at times in my life, and found this approach to be empowering. Other times I avoid the movement, the dance-and I'm not certain why. I have found this work quite helpful and recommend it to anybody who feels the need to better connect body and soul.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue further about this book, click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email.

Artemis Fowl is a weak anti-Potter, a villain I wanted to like, but found myself delighted in his failures. This book is light reading. The characters and plotlines do not have anywhere near the complexity of the Harry Potter books. Although the &quot;hero&quot; of the book is quite a villain, Artemis Fowl is not as dark as the last book or two of the Potter series and may be less nightmare provoking for precocious readers.<br />I enjoyed reading Artemis Fowl. A worthwhile dalliance while we await Rowland's next masterpiece. 100 years from now, when the Harry Potter books are considered classical literature, Artemis Fowl will likely go unremembered by all but the most avid literary trivia wonks.<br />Conclusion? If you enjoyed Harry Potter, and want more, you will likely enjoy this book if you can read it for itself, and not hope for the power and depth of the Potter series, on whose coattails it attempts to ride. A solid three stars. <br />(If you'd like to discuss this review or the book with me, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email. Thanks!)	2001-11-03

The first, and most familiar, is what she terms the &quot;dominator model.&quot; In the dominator model, diversity requires ranking and hierarchy, giving some power over others. The more unfamiliar model, the &quot;partnership model,&quot; does not equate diversity with either superiority or inferiority, but rather with community. &quot;There are two critical ways of structuring the relations between the female and male halves of humanity that profoundly affect the totality of a social system.&quot; (p. 105) . She coins two terms to represent these models: 1) &quot;Gylany,&quot; drawn from the Greek words for woman and man, she uses to describe partnership modes, and 2) &quot;Androcracy,&quot; literally &quot;rule by men,&quot; she frequently uses as a substitute for &quot;patriarchy.&quot; <br />Her title derives from symbols for these two paradigms: the chalice, symbolizing life begetting, community and sharing; and the blade, symbolizing the power to take rather than give lifethis is the ultimate power to establish and enforce domination. She points out that for millennia the blade has been a masculine symbol, this is not the problem.<br />&quot;The root of the problem lies in a social system in which the power of the Blade is idealizedin which both men and women are taught to equate true masculinity with violence and dominance and to see men who do not conform to this ideal as 'too soft' or 'effeminate.'&quot; (p. xviii)<br />She further points out that the directions of partnership cultures and dominator cultures will be quite different. Partnership cultures emphasize technologies to sustain and enhance life while dominator cultures develop technology to destroy and dominate. Consider our own culture, where schools resort to nearly every fund-raising dodge imaginable, even relying on the proceeds of gambling, while the military/industrial complex consumes the lion's share of our resources. The average teacher in California makes less than a wet-behind-the-ears college graduate who goes to work programming computers for a defense contractor! What would it be like if schools got all the money they needed and the Army had to hold bake sales to buy new hardware?<br />This book is an origin myth. It attempts to explain where we came from, how we evolved from an age of partnership to an age of domination. It also explores how we might begin to reverse the process. Numerous scholars have challenged Eisler's ideas and her use of archaeological evidence. I have noticed her sifting through Hebrew history and using only those aspects which support her theories, while ignoring important writings and events which tend to support a partnership paradigm while she is exposing the dominator model. Regardless of how well the evidence fits the history she lays out, this is a masterful piece of social deconstruction. Whether a golden partnership age existed or not, we do not live in one now, and we never will unless we learn to live differently together.<br />Eisler starts her chronicle with old Europe. She spends three chapters exploring the stone age, neolithic art, Goddess worship, and the equalitarian nature of partnership culture evinced through archaeological exploration Crete and the work of Marija Gimbutas. Then she begins to describe the Indo/Aryan/Kurgan invasions of Europe. She examines the role of metallurgy and male supremacy. She notes growing evidence of warfare, human sacrifice, and slavery. <br />She decries the truncation of civilization as partnership gives way to male domination of societies. She shows how memories of the partnership age lingered on in myths and religious practices for thousands of years until myths morphed, giving solar/warrior Gods supremacy over fertility/mother Goddesses. Women and sexuality were marginalized, securing the male domination of culture. She traces the effects of patriarchy through classic culture and the Christian mythos into the very heart of our modern civilization. <br />Although she does a masterful job of tracing the history of the problem, she offers little in this book for solving the problem. She spends 180 pages telling us how and where we went wrong, only to offer a paltry 18 pages generalizing about what we need to do now. I found this disappointing, but there's only so much that can be crammed into the pages of a single book. Her book, The Partnership Way, acts as a guide through this book for a group wishing to work within the partnership paradigm.<br />The Chalice and the Blade presents a powerful deconstruction of our society. It offers an &quot;origins myth&quot; to us and gives us a prophetic challenge to live differently. Although her use of scholarship has been attacked, this book is still worth reading. You don't have to run out and buy an Apple  Computer to &quot;think different,&quot; you can read this book!

When a man takes the plain words of Jesus to heart, when he preaches them and practices them, the poor flock to him, and the powerful fear, despise, and execute him. <br />&quot;The poor are a sacrament who can transform our lives if we are willing to open ourselves to them, to accompany them.&quot; (p. 14)<br />This book briefly outlines the story of Oscar Romero, his message, and his death. It touches on the violence and injustice taking place in El Salvador. It contrasts the Christian commitmen to life with the Capitalist/materialist commitment to death. The book cites his writings and journals on nearly every page. These passages touched my heart deeply.<br />But, this book was week on discussion about =HOW= Romero converted to the poor. I would have liked to know more about that--this was the primary reason I purchased the book, and I felt disappointed that it seemed to take a back seat to Romero's teachings and praxis. <br />&quot;There is nothing pretty about Christian hope. Whatever Chiristian hope is, it begins in terror and utter disorientation in the face of the collapse in all that is familiar ... It is no longer the hope of a rescue, but a fixed surety of that which is not seen, where there seems to be no way out, and where death and its system seem absolutely dominant; and it is this fixed surety of that which is not seen which empowers us to the forging of a counterhistory to that of the domination of death.&quot; (p. 84)<br />As Romero's story is told, he is held up as a christ figure, walking in the steps of his Master, proclaiming the gospel of the poor, to the poor, rebuking the powerful, and finally, executed at the altar during mass. <br />If only this book sold like &quot;The Jabez Prayer&quot; or some of the other, shallow, Christian best-sellers. That would reflect a transformation of mind and heart, one that is sorely needed in a land that condemned Clinton's sexual escapades, but not his policies of economic and structural injustice.<br />Five stars for broad coverage of Romero's thought. Four stars for telling the man's story--I wanted to feel how he wrestled through the issue of conversion to the poor, how he wrestled through his inevitable martyrdom.<br />(If you'd like to comment on this review or discuss the book more, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

If you need more gender inclusive language, be a person of excellence, read the book, and write a better review  ;-)]<br />Jose Ortega y Gasset, once a &quot;Liberal&quot; legislator in the doomed Spanish Republic, wrote Revolt of the Masses 70 years too soon. This elitist book, although seriously flawed, makes numerous excellent points, demands to be read in these opening years of the 21st Century, and should be quoted, frequently, publicly, and with great fervor. His elitism echoes through the writings of authors such as Robert Heinlein. This is exemplified in Starship Troopers, where men of excellence are chosen via military service; as does The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, where men of excellence outwait the yammering groups of &quot;Mass Man&quot; and then create a constitution, perceived as being democratically created.<br />Ortega y Gasset postulates that &quot;mass man&quot; has come to demand privilege without responsibility. With no idea of the workings of modern life, mass man expects it served up to him on a silver platter. Mass man pays no homage to the &quot;men of excellence&quot; who create, who move society forward, who shoulder responsibility. Ortega y Gasset's fatal flaw is his inability to separate the passivism and immaturity in &quot;mass man,&quot; which is a response to the infantilizing power of a hierarchical paradigm of domination, from the inherent state of mankind, which is excellence. While only a small vanguard may rise out of that passivity while dominated and enslaved, numerous historical examples clearly demonstrate the fallacy of Ortega y Gasset's argument. <br />Two brief counter-examples: the Spanish anarchists (see The Spanish Anarchists: TheHeroic Years 1868-1936, by Murray Bookchin; Homage to Catalonia, by George Orwell, and the movie Land and Freedom) and the open source community. In the areas of Spain where anarchists took control, people worked together efficiently to oppose the Fascist insurgency. Franco's forces were held back by anarchists militias, working democratically, with little hierarchical structure. Anarchists organized the labor forces and ran factories by worker control, producing weapons and supplies. Bookchin tells us that these anarchists were a disciplined lot:<br />The more dedicated men, once having decided to embrace the &quot;Idea [anarchism],&quot; abjured smoking and drinking, avoided brothels, and purged their talk of &quot;foul&quot; language. They believed these traits to be &quot;vices&quot;--demeaning to free people and fostered deliberately by ruling classes to corrupt and enslave the workers spiritually.&quot; (p. 48) <br />&quot;Anarchist-influenced unions gave higher priority to leisure and free time for self-development than to high wages and economic gains.&quot; (p. 50)<br />This is not the behavior which Ortega y Gasset attributes to mass man. This is the behavior of his &quot;men of excellence.&quot; Examining this evidence we find that when people are free, they are also free to be excellent. In the &quot;open source&quot; community (those who brought us Linux, Gnu, etc.), we also find &quot;men of excellence.&quot; We find people, free from corporate domination, who, without remuneration, have created one of the most sophisticated and reliable software systems for the mass market today. (Linux has been described as far more stable, efficient, and powerful than any Microsoft Windows product.) Again, freedom breeds excellence. The paradigm of domination and power-over does not exist in the open source community the way it does in a commercial environment. <br />Nevertheless, Ortega y Gasset has served up an apt description of the &quot;typical&quot; American,who watches 35 hours of TV each week and feels the ideas he absorbs from Rush Limbaugh, Jerry Falwell, Matt Drudge, and the late news equal the work of serious scholars and intellectuals. Most of us Americans have long since abdicated our power and responsibility to &quot;somebody else.&quot; We dont really trust our government, but we expect somebody else to fix it. We are the &quot;mass man&quot; who demands more government services, fewer taxes, and a higher quality of living, while refusing to volunteer our time in our communities. I conducted an informal poll in the weeks following the 9/11/01 tragedies. The more American flags a person displayed, the less likely he was to have voted in the 2000 presidential elections! While tens of millions of Americans fought terrorism by putting cheap flag stickers on their windows and automobile antennas, only a small minority of the citizenry took action: from donating blood to working for peace.<br />Ortega y Gasset's contempt for mass man echoes the fear of the Spanish Liberals. They feared both fascism and proletarian liberation movements. They wished to hang on to their middle class privilege without being dominated from above, or being equalized from below. A social and political hierarchy helped them to maintain their privilege. Contrasting this stance with more equalitarian writings is an interesting experience. I recommend that Reane Eisler's Chalice and the Blade also be read, to lend insight on how societies of people of excellence were compelled to become mass man. Daniel Quinn, in his Ishmael books, also deconstructs how societies produce mass man to maintain power hierarchies.<br />One of the most prophetic parts of the book was Ortega y Gasset's exposition on the union of Europe. He saw that the creation of a single European state was an inevitable part of the historical process. Watching the European nations struggle to come together as an economic unit it is easy to see his &quot;prophecy&quot; being fulfilled. He also made a profound statement about the democratic process; one that every flag-waving American ought to consider deeply: <br />&quot;The health of democracies, of whatever type and range, depends on a wretched technical detailelectoral procedure. All the rest is secondary. If the regime of the elections is successful, if it is in accordance with reality, all goes well; if not, though the rest progresses beautifully, all goes wrong.&quot; (p. 158) <br />Regardless of how many flags get waved, regardless of how many red-white-and-blue ribons get pinned on clothes, the 2000 election went terribly wrong. The Supreme Court prevented a full and accurate count from being conducted.  The man in the White House was not put there by the vote of the American people, but by the vote of the United States Supreme Court. &quot;All [has] gone wrong.&quot;<br />The book is full of concise, brilliant, quotables. Here are a few of my favorite:<br />&quot;All of life is the struggle, the effort to be itself. The difficulties which I meet with in order to realise my existence are precisely what awaken and mobilise my activities, my capacities.&quot; (p. 99)<br />&quot;Human life has arisen and progressed only when the resources it could count on were balanced by the problems it met with.&quot; (p. 101)<br />&quot;If that life of mine, which only concerns myself, is not directed by me towards something, it will be disjointed, lacking in tension and in form. In these years we are witnessing the gigantic spectacle of innumerable human lives wandering about lost in their own labyrinths, through not having anything to which to give themselves.&quot; (p. 141)<br />&quot;There is truth only in an existence which feels its acts as irrevocably necessary.&quot; (p. 182)<br />Who should read The Revolt of the Masses? Everybody. This book throws down a gauntlet challenging us all to become people of excellence, to participate in shaping our own destinies, rather than handing that over to a few rich men in suits in corporate boardrooms and congressional offices. Ortega y Gasset writes well, better than the average philosopher. The translation from Spanish sacrifices no readability. Although I disagree with him on a major premise, I still must find this book to be a solid, five-star read.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue about this book or review, please click on the &quot;About Me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email.

Frick survived. Berkman went to jail. Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist is Berkman's account, not only of the revolutionary ardor which drove him to assault Frick, but also of the horrors of incarceration and the transformation of his own thinking while behind bars.<br />We get plenty of revolutionary and anarchist theory from Berkman. He opens a door into the thoughts and feelings of people struggling for economic and social justice 100 years ago. More than that, he opens a door into the mindset of a fanatic, one which may help us understand the motivations of those who flew their planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11/2001:<br />&quot;Could anything be nobler than to die for a grand, a sublime Cause? Why, the very life of a true revolutionist has no other purpose, no significance whatever, save to sacrifice it on the altar of the beloved People.&quot; (p. 12)<br />&quot;My own individuality is entirely in the background; aye, I am not conscious of any personality in matters pertaining to the Cause. I am simply a revolutionist; a terrorist by conviction, an instrument for furthering the cause of humanity.&quot; (p. 13)<br />&quot;True, the Cause often calls upon the revolutionist to commit an unpleasant act; but it is the test of a true revolutionist-nay, more, his pride-to sacrifice all merely human feeling at the call of the People's Cause.&quot; (p. 12)<br />Berkman, the purist, disdains his fellow prisoners. He sees himself as better than they are, a Servant of Humanity, not a petty criminal, a predator on the poor. But, life in prison, although it does not shake his revolutionary and anarchist convictions, does bring him down from his ivory tower. Berkman begins to see that:<br />&quot;The individual, in certain cases, is of more direct and immediate consequence than humanity.What is the latter but the aggregate of individual existences-and shall these, the best of them, forever be sacrificed for the metaphysical collectivity?&quot; (p. 403)<br />His revolutionary understanding also shifts. He begins to differentiate between the autocratic despotism of Europe and the despotism of republican institutions:<br />&quot;The despotism of republican institutions is far deeper, more insidious, because it rests on the popular delusion of self-government and independence. That is the subtle source of democratic tyranny, and, as such, it cannot be reached with a bullet. In modern capitalism, exploitation rather than oppression is the real enemy of the people ... the battle is to be waged in the economic rather than the political field.&quot; (p. 424)<br />This is not, however, a political manifesto (for that, one can read Berkman's ABCs of Anarchism). Berkman reveals his inner processes during fourteen years of incarceration. We discover, not only the horrors and corruption of the prison system, but also wander intimately through Berkman's mind. We visit his childhood, soften at unexpected gentlenesses behind bars, and begin to appreciate something as simple as the sunrise. <br />Although Berkman did not write the memoir until after he left prison, it has a sense of surreal immediacy. He wrote in the present tense, but that alone does not account for the way his text grips, and drags the reader into the maelstrom of his experience. We run with him through childhood memories, daily brutality, fantasies of escape and suicide, and the ideals that keep him sane. His longing for Emma Goldman shines through the text. He enthrones her almost as the guardian of his sanity through the years. Little can compare with the poignancy of his fantasy of mailing himself to his beloved Emma, escaping prison and finding himself with her again. (p. 135-137)<br />Five stars. Absolutely brilliant work, as relevant today as it was nearly 100 years ago. In her autobiography, Living my Life, Emma Goldman recounted how Berkman saved his sanity and his life by writing this memoir. The deep introspection, the flights of fancy, the accounting of prison life-all deeply illumine the best and the worst of human nature. This book is required reading for anybody who wishes to understand the fanatical, terrorist mindset, for Berkman describes that aptly. Far more importantly, he shares the experience of survival and transformation. He, who entered prison a fanatic, left those iron gates more committed than ever to his cause, but no longer a fanatic. His story tells of graduating from terrorist to humanist, from monomaniacal fanatic to a deeply committed human being. If you read nothing else this year, read this book.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue with me about this book or review, please click the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

James Morrow wrestles with the age-old challenge of theodicy--how can an all-Good and all-Powerful Deity allow a world with suffering? His vehicle in this excursion is God's daughter, a fertilized ovum found in a male sperm donation, and brought to term in an artificial uterus. <br />The world is indeed a dark place, and Julie Katz, (That's &quot;Miss God&quot; to you!) seems to find herself in some of the darkest corners. Why is God so distant? Why are miracles so useless? <br />Religious fanatics and Devout Believers in Scientism both show up in bad form in this book. If you're an existentialist with a dark sense of humor, you'll love reading this. If you're a devout, evangelical Christian, I suspect you won't have as much fun.<br />Morrow writes well, he dares to tread on the teats of many a sacred cow, and he does so exquisitely well. For those who find their understanding of God and religion offended, I offer you this quote from Julie Katz &quot;If somebody kick your right buttock, turn the other cheek.&quot; (p. 260)<br />Although the characters are somewhat charicaturish, they each have their own depth, motivation, and occasionally act to surprise the reader. The leading characters are more archetypal than human, and that is part of the book's power.<br />Morrow gets five stars for a solid, well engineered plot. Five stars for characters who live beyond the pages of the books &amp; occasionally drift into our dreams. Five more stars for telling it well, with tongue firmly planted in cheek. Courage. Morrow gets about five billion stars for courage--after all, he's insulted every fundamentalist this side of Venus. Once Jerry Falwell gets done blaming the gays, pagans, ACLU &amp; secular humanists for the World Trade Center disaster, he's likely to call for a Jihad against Morrow!<br />(If you'd like to respond to this review or discuss the book, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

Anarchism is a great libidinal movement of humanity to shake off the repressive apparatus created by hierarchical society. It originates in the age-old drive of the oppressed to assert the spirit of freedom, equality, and spontaneity over values and institutions based on authority.&quot; (p. 16) Nineteenth Century Spain was rife with oppressive and authoritarian institutions-a culture medium, as it were, for Anarchism. <br />Bookchin traces the growth of the movement, explaining the various forms through which the anarchistic &quot;Idea&quot; developed. He briefly explores the influences of Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Bakunin, and contrasts them with the bleak realities of the Spanish political situation. The Spanish anarchists were not an unruly mob of bomb hurling terrorists, they were &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in the best sense of the term. Many exemplified self-discipline: <br />&quot;The more dedicated men, once having decided to embrace the &quot;Idea,&quot; abjured smoking and drinking, avoided brothels, and purged their talk of &quot;foul&quot; language. They believed these traits to be &quot;vices&quot;--demeaning to free people and fostered deliberately by ruling classes to corrupt and enslave the workers spiritually.&quot; (p. 48)<br />&quot;Anarchist-influenced unions gave higher priority to leisure and free time for self-development than to high wages and economic gains.&quot; (p. 50)<br />&quot;A very compelling case, in fact, can be made for the argument that Spanish Anarchism refracted the spirit of Enlightenment Europe through an Iberian prism, breaking up its components and then reorganizing them to suit Spain's distinctive needs.&quot; (p. 51)<br />Bookchin threads his way through the maze of Spanish politics, explaining the labyrinthine changes of government and policy. At each step, whether liberal or more totalitarian, the poor kept on getting poorer and the rich kept on getting richer. At one point, a system known as Turnismo existed. &quot;Liberal&quot;and repressive regimes would regularly share the power back and forth. When capitalists and land-owners needed to reduce the power of unions, a &quot;liberal&quot; regime took power, and while promising land reform and better working conditions, repressed the unions. At other times the more totalitarian regimes ran things, at times easing a few restrictions to keep the populace content. (One can perhaps imagine a bit of &quot;turnismo&quot; in the Bush/Clinton/Bush administrations!)<br />Anarchism flourished in both the countryside and in the cities. Many pueblos had traditionally run themselves by ideals approaching anarchism. These folks accepted the &quot;Idea&quot; readily. syndicalist unions also found themselves attracted to anarchism.<br />Anarchists formed their own schools. Francisco Ferrer founded the Escuela Moderna, with &quot;a curriculum based on the natural sciences and moral rationalism, freed of all religious dogma and political bias ... [there was to be] no atmosphere of competition, coercion, or humiliation. The classes were, in Ferrer's words, to be guided by the &quot;principle of solidarity and equality ... Instruction was to rely exclusively on the spontaneous desire of students to acquire knowledge and permit them to learn at their own pace. The purpose of the school was ... to create solid minds, capable of forming their own rational convictions on every subject.&quot; (p. 117) This system was so successful that within a decade over 50 such schools existed in Spain. Eventually, however, Ferrer paid for his &quot;radical&quot; educational ideas with his life; the government executed him on October 13, 1909.<br />Bookchin traces the encounters between socialists and anarchists. He takes the time to establish the difference between the two groups (To oversimplify: socialists depended on central organization, while anarchists looked to the local &quot;grupos de affinidad&quot; (affinity groups) for decision making). These differences became crucial during the Spanish Civil War, when communists fought anarchists in the streets, rather than working with them to defeat Franco and his Fascist minions.<br />The book does a great job of explaining the world into which the Spanish Civil War burst in 1936. Bookchin, however, does not enter that conflict. He leaves that to other writers, and perhaps with good reason. The Civil War led to the total repression of Spanish Anarchism. Having the book stop while the Anarchism was still in the ascendancy and not yet being systematically destroyed, first by its &quot;revolutionary&quot; allies, and then by Fascism.<br />In his concluding remarks, Bookchin makes a bold claim: &quot;Although Spanish Anarchism was virtually unknown to radicals abroad during the &quot;heroic years&quot; of its development, it could be argued in all earnestness that it marked the most magnificent flowering and , in the curious dialectic of such processes, the definitive end of the century-long history of proletarian Socialism.&quot; (p. 278)<br />&quot;The genius of Spanish Anarchism stems from its ability to fuse the concerns of traditional proletarian socialism with broader, more contemporary aspirations.&quot; (p. 286) Bookchin concludes by showing how &quot;The larger problems of abolishing hierarchy and domination, of achieving a spiritually nourishing daily life, of replacing mindless toil by meaningful work, of attaining the free time for the self-management of a truly solidarizing human community ... [all this can be sensed in] sectors of society that were never accorded serious consideration as forces for revolution  within the economic framework of proletarian socialism.&quot;<br />This book is required reading for anybody who wishes to understand the causes of the Spanish Civil War. It also presents some of the greatest Anarchist accomplishments in recent history. Bookchin related the history well and held my attention. I strongly recommend this book to anybody interested in Anarchism, in the Spanish Civil War, or who has ever read Garcia y Vega's REVOLT OF THE MASSES. It also makes understanding Orwell's HOMAGE TO CATALONIA much easier.<br />Five stars for scholarship, five stars for making history accessible, five stars for explaining difficult situations and concepts. <br />(If you'd like to dialogue about this book or review, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

US	52416483	R38WR0Q9YV33BA	0156421178	802050474	Homage to Catalonia	Books	5	8	10	N	Y	From Journalist to Combatant to Commentator	In late 1936 George Orwell went to Spain to write newspaper articles about the civil war, but joined the POUM militia almost immediately &quot;because at that time and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do ... it was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle.&quot; Seven month later, he escaped from Spain, a wanted man, sought out by the Stalinist forces because of his membership in the communist POUM militia! Although an eye-witness, Orwell recognizes the subjectivity of his account:<br />&quot;I hope the account I have given is not too misleading. I believe that on such an issue as this no one is or can be completely truthful. It is difficult to be certain about anything except what you have seen with your own eyes, and consciously or unconsciously everyone writes as a partisan. In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now: beware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events.&quot;<br />Orwell describes the misery of life in the trenches well. Prior to reading this book I had viewed (and reviewed) the video LAND AND FREEDOM, which is loosely spun off of Orwell's experiences. This book manages to capture the misery and discomfort that most war movies gloss over: lice, cold, damp, chill, sleeplessness, etc. Although he has much positive to say about the equalitarian nature of the militias (the same pay, food, &amp; clothing for officers &amp; men, mingling on terms of equality, voting on decisions), he repeatedly points out &quot;uncivilized&quot; and unsanitary conditions and behavior. For example:<br />&quot;Sometimes it gave you a sneaking sympathy with the Fascist ex-owners to see the way the militia treated the buildings they had seized. In La Granja every room that was not in use had been turned into a latrine-a frightful shambles of smashed furniture and excrement.&quot;<br />Besideslife in the trenches, he tells of the street fighting in Barcelona between anti-Fascist forces, tells of being wounded, of treatment, the ban on the POUM, and living as a wanted man until his escape. <br />The politics of the Spanish civil war are Byzantine at best. Orwell separates the political struggles of Republican Spain into two separate chapters, allowing readers who wish to ignore them to focus on his account of life during the struggle. He characterizes the Spanish struggle as the collision  of three forces: 1) The workers (the anarchist FAI &amp; CNT, the communist POUM, and liberal socialists), 2) the Fascists (led by Franco's rebellious forces), and 3) the &quot;republican&quot; Liberals, Communists (Stalinists), and &quot;right-wing&quot; socialists. The workers seized the opportunity of opposing Franco's Fascism to promote social revolution. The Liberals and Communists worked to oppose social revolution and championed their struggle as one of liberal democracy against totalitarian Fascism. This led to the suppression of the workers' parties and militias.<br />Orwell returned to England, still hoping that Franco with his Nazi and Fascist mercenaries could be turned back. Ultimately, the social revolution in Spain was suppressed, first by &quot;liberal&quot; forces, and then, they, too, were suppressed by the Fascists. <br />This tale paints a human picture of life during the Spanish civil war. Orwell was able to leave the conflict. Most were not. Although the terrorism of smashing jumbo jets into skyscrapers shocks our consciousness, the systematic terror of Franco's government had a far higher toll in human life and liberty. As we face the challenge of responding to terrorism, let us remember that governmental suppression is far more dangerous in the long run than a few determined fanatics. <br />Five stars for literary ability. Five stars for being able to present the Spanish political situation comprehensibly. Five stars for an enjoyable and powerfulstory. While less well known than Orwell's ANIMAL FARM and 1984, this book intensifies the meaning of his more popular writings.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue about this review, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

My copy call it &quot;A novel about man's place in the Universe.&quot; This trilogy weaves a multi-dimensional tapestry to point out the absurdities and dangers of a warrior/dominator culture. <br />The story introduces itself with the discovery of &quot;Charlie,&quot; a 50,000 year-old human corpse on the moon. How did he get there when Neanderthals still walked the Earth? The first book answers this question, but opens up to deeper mystery. In the process it introduces the reader to one of the processes in the scientific community. <br />New scientific theories begin when attempts to explain a discovery challenge the assumptions of the current paradigm. Complicated theories develop more and more unsupportable  mechanisms until somebody has the courage to challenge a  fundamental tenet of the old paradigm: &quot;the earth is not the  center of the universe&quot; or &quot;the continents drift.&quot; Hogan  makes this process seem relatively quick and painless. In  the real world, it may take decades--once people were even  burned at the stake for this kind of breakthrough.<br />The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, the second book in the trilogy, avoids the abyss many authors fall into between the hook of the first book and the climax of the third. An interesting book in its own right, it tells a story about humankind's first extraterrestrial contact. It explains more pieces of the mystery of &quot;Charlie,&quot; but it also raises more questions--questions  the aliens cannot answer. <br />Philosophically, this book allows Hogan to describe a non-violent, non-coercive society, and how it might have evolved naturally. Frequent contrasts between the aliens and humans continuously demonstrate two points: how aggressive behavior, of both individuals and governments, threatens the human race and impedes social and personal development;and how our<br />aggressiveness also gifts us with creativity and the ability to make rapid &quot;progress.&quot; It proffers the challenge of aggressively pursuing knowledge while pursuing peace and the ability to live together in community.<br />Finishing up the trilogy with Giant's Star, Hogan answers the  questions that have haunted us for two books. Only one mystery  remains, and that is a blatant irony that points out the absurdity of dominator behavior (This trilogy makes interesting reading after Rianne Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade). <br />On these pages we discover the splendors of the Giants' home planet, a &quot;final&quot; explanation of human evolution, the vast conspiracy to use superstition and religion to prevent human development, and some conspirators with a nefarious scheme to deal the human race out of galactic history. Resolving these issues leads to a satisfying conclusion to a complex trilogy.<br />It's interesting to look back with a quarter-century's perspective and see the world Hogan projected. While the Cold War is over, the United States and Soviet Union still compete economically in Hogan's universe--in ours, the remnants of the Soviet Union struggle on as Third World nations. In both universes there is a European Union. Hogan describes internet communication between laptops, but conceptualizes it as portable videophones. Does anybody remember Digital Equipment Corporation (now folded into Compaq)? Hogan anticipates DEC minicomputers onboard sub-orbital transports. Of course, he worked for DEC when he wrote these stories!<br />Hogan has woven a compelling universe, one that is a pleasure to explore. His characters lack depth, but his story telling ability brings them alive. Five stars for an exciting,  consistent, and complex universe. Four stars for writing style.  Three for character development. A great deal of fun to read--and even more fun to think about.

Carl Hiaasen targets politicians, lobbyists, and developers who seek to line their own pockets at the expense of the common welfare. Not a dull, moralistic diatribe, Hiaasen dances with the absurd and exhibits a truly warped sense of humor that deeply satisfies the reader's sense of justice.<br />Twilly Spree, the &quot;hero&quot; of this novel, makes an entrance into the tale by tailgating Palmer Stoat, a lobbyist and litterbug (among other, unredeemable personality traits). Twilly is out to teach Stoat a lesson--trying to change his sociopathic behavior. Stoat, however, seems not to have learned, not even in kindergarten, how to behave in society. No matter how extreme Twilly gets (and he does get extreme), Stoat remains clueless.<br />Hiaasen demonstrates a truly enjoyable sense of the outrageous and improbable. In order to explain a forest bulldozing engineer's bent towards destruction, he spins the following: &quot;Krimmler's antipathy toward nature was traceable to one seminal event: At age six, while attending a Lutheran church picnic, he'd been bitten on the scrotum by a wild chipmunk&quot; (p. 292). Yet another character, Mr. Gash, enjoys layering audio tapes of 911 calls over classical music. Then there's Mr. Clapley, who carries Barbie dolls with him, and the hooker who only prostitutes herself for registered Republicans. All these characters pale, however, against Skink, the ex-governor who lives in the wild, dining on road-kill and preying on Florida's despoilers.<br />If there is any redeeming value, beyond twisted humor (isn't that in and of itself redeeming?), in this book, we find it in a short speech by Skink to Twilly, who he has begun to mentor:<br />&quot;Son, I can't tell you what to do with your life--hell, you've seen what I've done with mine. But Iwill tell you there's probably no peace for people like you and me in this world. Somebody's got to be angry or nothing gets fixed. That's what we were put here for, to stay p_ss_d off&quot; (p. 457).<br />It's easy to finish the book, and go on to the next. After all, it's only fiction, right? I grew up in the San Bernardino Valley. Back then, orange groves ruled the land. Now, only a few remain. Developers are planting survey stakes in the hills where my friends and I used to build our fortresses and catch poison oak. It's not just Hiaasen villains who despoil the land, it's real life developers and politicians--destroying farmland and wilderness to make a fast buck, leaving the rest of us trapped in ever more gridlocked rush hour traffic.<br />Maybe, between books (or even book reviews), you can find the time to check out your local conservation groups, and do a little something to throw a monkey wrench at the Stoats, Artemuses and Clapleys of this world.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review further, please click on the &quot;About Me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

It is the story of learning and overcoming, not just external challenges, but also internal threats. <br />During much of the book, Bean, the protagonist, kept reminding me of Okonkwo, the hero of Achebe's THINGS FALL APART (also a very worthy read), trying to use personal achievement to weave himself into community. But, Card moves Bean beyond this, and develops his character in unexpected ways. <br />I devoured this book in two days. My thireen-year-old son beat me to it by months. He had already read ENDER'S GAME and kept hounding me to read ENDER'S SHADOW. He was right--I very much enjoyed reading it. It's one of those books that is not only fascinating to read, but somehow leaves one fealing a little more whole, a little more healed for having read it....<br />Five more stars for Orson Scott Card. Just read the book. None of these reviews will do it justice.	2001-07-05

I know the name of the woman who serves my friend and me breakfast each Friday morning at a chain restaurant. I've bought charity lotto tickets from her sons and know the story of her daughter who died when the insurance company insisted on using a cheaper lab. I know that when minimum wage increased,  management cut her hours so her paycheck remained the same, but the workload increased. But I don't know anybody at the copy shop, the fast-food joints, or even the grocery store. They all merge with the background, human servants of the commercial machine upon which my life depends. <br />NICKEL AND DIMED: ON (NOT) GETTING BY IN AMERICA tells the story of what a privileged and articulate writer experienced when she attempted to live as an &quot;unskilled&quot; working class person. Barbara Ehrenreich spent time in Key West, Maine, and Minnesota holding down jobs as a waitress, nursing home aide, cleaning woman, and Wall-Mart &quot;associate.&quot; She attempted to live on the wages these jobs paid--without drawing on her skills as a PhD, author, or lecturer. <br />Ehrenreich writes well. Her story engages the reader from the first page of the introduction to the final page of her &quot;Evaluation&quot; chapter. Her frustration leaked through the page and into me. I became enraged at the humiliating bosses and the abusive working conditions--and then I'd close the book and reflect that millions of people endure worse with no hope of writing up their notes and producing a best-seller from their experiences. <br />While the anecdotes of Ehrenreich's experience were at least entertaining, her evaluation of the experience became the most interesting part of the book to me. She evaluated her experience through the Liberal lense of class conflict and power dynamics. It would be interesting to read a companion volume written by a &quot;Conservative&quot; journalist who ventured the same experiment. <br />She discovered that while no job is truly &quot;unskilled,&quot; the low wage jobs that she got made physical demands, some of which could be damaging if performed month after month--even for a physically fit person. She found few no rewards for heroic performance, that &quot;the trick lies in figuring out how to budget your energy so there'll be some left over for the next day&quot; (p. 195). She found that it is nearly impossible to earn enough money to survive on with just a single job, even during the tight labor market of 1999:<br />&quot;Something is wrong, very wrong, when a single person in good health, a person who in addition possesses a working car, can barely support herself by the sweat of her brow. You don't need a degree in economics to see that wages are too low and rents too high&quot; (p. 199).<br />She examines the pressures exerted on workers to keep them subservient and from asserting their power. She challenges the idea that we are a democracy if large numbers of citizens spend half their waking hours in what amounts to a &quot;dictatorship&quot; in the workplace. She also speculates on the depressive effects of the disempowerment to which the &quot;working poor&quot; must submit.<br />Ehrenreich challenges the myth of the American Dream. Even her co-workers subscribed to this myth, working hard so that someday they, too, could live affluent lifestyles, failing to evaluate the extreme unlikelihood that they would ever leave the ranks of the working poor. Our last elected president came up from poverty--so did his opponent, Ross Perot. &quot;This is America, anybody can become a millionaire!&quot; That is the myth--one which keeps the workers docile. Ehrenreich believes that eventually that myth will be rejected:<br />&quot;Someday ... they are bound to tire of getting so little in return and to demand to be paid what they're worth. There'll be a lot of anger when that day comes, and strikes and disruption&quot; (p. 221). Although she never actually uses the word &quot;revolution,&quot; her book demand that it's time for the &quot;Compassionate&quot; Conservatives to stop telling the workers to eat cake and to pay attention to the growing inequalities in our society.<br />Five stars for the courage to do the research and five for writing style. I only give her conclusion four stars because I believe her experiment deserved a better epilogue, more forcefully dispelling the post-Reagan myths about poverty and upward mobility. Regardless of your political/economic beliefs, this book demands to be read. Perhaps you'll evaluate Barbara's experiences and come to different conclusions ... or perhaps you'll find that you start seeing people who had been an invisible part of your life all along. Don't avoid this book, you owe it to yourself and to the people who stock your shelves, run the cash registers, deliver food to your table &amp; clean your hotel rooms. <br />(If you'd like to dialogue about this book or review, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

Depending on the reader's political expectations, Emma's life is either inspiring or downright terrifying. Those who believe in social conformity would probably be more comfortable moving on to other fodder. <br />Nevertheless, this eyewitness account of American and Russian history, ought not to be trivially dismissed. Emma fought for things we have taken for granted in modern life, such as birth-control and the eight-hour work day; she went to jail in the struggle to obtain these for us. This book explains how she lived her commitment to individual liberty, choosing who she would love, advocating revolution, and harrassing those of her &quot;allies&quot; who compromised on these principles. <br />Perhaps the most interesting portion of the book is her years in Russia. Here she describes arriving at the &quot;Promised Land&quot; of the peoples' revolution and how that mutated into a sense of disillusionment and horror at what she saw as the betrayal of that revolution by the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;<br />Her writing style is nothing exceptional, but the story she weaves from the material of her life is nothing short of fascinating.  Another reviewer suggested taking a break between volumes--I couldn't! I had to know what happened next. <br />Although there are a lot of pages to wade through, I will give this book as a gift to the young women in my life. I believe that Emma can serve as a role model for living one's own life, not living out the expectations of friends, family, or society. In a dysfunctional world, we have too few people who model this.<br />Emma gets three stars for writing style, but the powerful and plentiful content bring the rating up to five stars. Not to be missed.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review, click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email. Thanks!)	2001-06-27

She draws on early literature, legend, folk traditions (and records of now extinct folk traditions), and archaelogy to construct several categories of functioning for the Goddesses. She discovers Goddesses who are both nurturing and demanding, healing and destructive, revered and feared. Davidson includes Celtic, Norse, Finnish, and Latvian Goddesses, and frequently compares them to Mediterranean and Near Eastern Goddess roles. <br />She first considers the Goddess as Mistress of the animals, examining her roles as Hunting Goddess, Ruler of the Wild, Guardian of the diary [sic] herds, as Dog and Horse Goddess. <br />Next, she examines the Goddess as Mistress of the Grain, considering the most ancient roots associating Goddesses with fertility of the earth, the connection between Goddess and plough, the possibility of Goddess as Corn Spirit, and how the Grain Goddess of the North differed from Grain Goddesses of more temperate regions.<br />Davidson then takes up the Goddess as Mistress of the Distaff and Loom, looking both the context of Goddess and weaving in the ancient world as well as the differences in Northern Europe. She considers the Oseberg wall-hagnings, retrieved from a burial site, and illuminates Goddess figures found there. She also examines the interplay between weaving and destiny, the Goddess as Weaver of Fate.<br />In addition, she considers the domestic role of the Goddess as Mistress of the Household. She discusses Guardians of the home, the association between Goddess and fire and water, and the role of the Goddes in the birth and nurturing of children. <br />Finally, she examines the Goddess as Mistress of Life and Death, writing of her role as healer and in the realm of death. She also considers Northern European funeral rites and how they help us understand the roles of the Goddess.<br />Davidson points out that when we sentimentalize the Goddess, as so many white-light-bunny-fluff-goddess-of-the-week books do, we lose a great deal. She draws on Jung in her synthesis that the Goddess is both attractive and nurturing as well as repulsive and frightening. In her conclusion she points out that the Goddess was much more than simply the &quot;Great Mother.&quot; <br />The book has a useful index and an excellent bibliography. It was poorly copy edited, however, with several typos. I also wish that Davidson had done a better job of separating out the layers of history through which she excavates. The meaning of stone-age evidence is poorly differentiated from the meanings of myths recorded in the middle ages or folk practices recorded in the 17th century. This is a significant problem which the book poorly addresses.<br />Five stars for depth and breadth, but knocked down to four stars for the failure to explicitly consider the impact of various historical contexts on the available evidence and on her interpetation of it.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review, click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

Irvin Yalom uses his experience with ten clients to illustrate how people change in therapy. Sometimes the change comes out of brilliant insights, sometimes it comes from the therapist's mistakes. Either way, Yalom's integrity in relating these vignettes helps the reader understand the process better. <br />If you're not in therapy, perhaps this book will help you understand yourself and your internal processes a bit better. Which of Yalom's patients do you identify with? Which to you totally reject? Either of those patients, and Yalom's treatment of them, has something to teach you. <br />If you are in therapy, notice how Yalom treats his patients, how he thinks about them. How does this compare to your relationship with your therapist? Do you experience the same challenges, the same caring, the same dynamic? Or do you just show up and whine for an hour? <br />As a therapist, I found Yalom's work particularly brave. Who would write a book about their mistakes? Yet, from his mistakes, I find myself learning--and also better enabled to learn from my mistakes. Reading Love's Executioner helped to keep me from sitting on that God-like Throne and remember to be a human being with my clients; a fellow sufferer, an ally in the healing process. <br />And if the idea of therapy seems not to apply to you, then you may simply find this book a fascinating story about how a thoughtful and insightful man deals with the sorrows, wounds, and needs of other human beings.

I found this last one a bit more fantastic than what had come before. It almost moved into Piers Anthony territory, but without the puns. Yes, we encounter &quot;realities&quot; (Everything you think you know is wrong) where not just politics and technological evolution are different, but the &quot;human&quot; species has evolved differently, too. Fun to play with these speculative worlds, but not as entrancing (for me) as the ones that more nearly paralleled _this_ world. <br />And yes, the reader finally gets the Holy Grail in this novel, but is it really anything more than just another cup? It doesn't matter, the quest was a lot of fun. We even got a bit of character development in the process. The worst thing about this book is how hard it is to get ahold of. It took me three months to track one down. If you're contemplating reading the trilogy (a worthwhile endeavor), then make certain you have a copy of this book in your hands before you begin!	2001-05-29

It took me a few more years to discover this absolute gem of a book, itself both bread for the soul and leaven for the mind. <br />The first half of this book consists of Frankl's reflection on his time in a Nazi concentration camp. &quot;An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior,&quot; (p. 18) he notices, &quot;Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent.&quot; (p. 43) Distilling the essence of his experience at the hands of the Nazis and the resilience of his soul, he states, &quot;If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.&quot; (p. 67) Finally, he notes that &quot;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.&quot; (p. 65) <br />He segues into the second part of the book, a description of &quot;logotherapy,&quot; based on the challenge learned behind barbed wire, downwind from the ovens &quot;Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why--an aim--for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible _how_ of their existence.&quot; (p. 76) <br />Frankl states that &quot;Man's search for meaning is a primary force in his life and not a 'secondary rationalization' of instinctual drives.&quot; (p. 99) He finds this meaning specific &amp; unique to each individual. Logotherapy focuses on the future, the assignments and meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in _his_ future, breaking up the self-centeredness of the neurotic instead of fostering and reinforcing it. <br />He believes that &quot;the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves, but rather detected,&quot; (p. 101) that &quot;_logos_, or 'meaning', is not only an emerging from existence itself but rather something confronting existence.&quot; (p. 100) This _logos_ frustrates by not being available to finite minds, but nevertheless continues to confront man. In wrestling with this confrontation, each individual enacts their &quot;will to meaning,&quot; defining a &quot;meaning of life [that] differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.&quot; (p. 110)   Logotherapy sees responsibility as the very essence of human existence: &quot;each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by _answering_ _for_ his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.&quot; (p. 111) Thus, the &quot;categorical imperative&quot; of logotherapy is &quot;Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&quot; (p. 111) <br />Beyond the philosophy of logotherapy, Frankl discusses technique briefly, addressing anticipatory anxiety, &quot;it characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid.&quot; (p. 123) The mechanism for this is &quot;hyper-intention,&quot; which, by focusing on the problem, magnifies the problem. He confronts this with &quot;paradoxical intention,&quot; suggesting that the insomniac try to stay awake and that the phobic patient &quot;intend, if only for a moment, precisely that which he fears.&quot; (p. 125) <br />He concludes the book with &quot;Our generation is realistic for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who has invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who has entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.&quot; (p. 136)<br />I find this short book incredibly full of life and meaning; it's one of the most powerful I've ever read. The act of creating a philosophy and psychology of life out of the horrors of Auschwitz confronts my own whinings about the discomforts I find in life. I find courage here, not just Dr. Frankl's courage, but an inspiration to my own courage, and a challenge to live more fully, to create more meaning, instead of simply accepting the meanings thrust upon me by TV sitcoms, billboards, and internet banality. <br />The epitome of a five star book. Worthy of more if Amazon would allow it. <br />(If you'd like to dialogue about this book, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link &amp; drop me an email. Thanks!)	2001-05-24

Thirteenth Floor wasn't based on this novel (or the series, either), but that movie kept coming to mind as I read the first part of Cybernetic Walrus. Chalker is original and creative in this book, though, and it's much more satisfying than the &quot;What Is Real?&quot; movies out there. A thoroughly enjoyable book, stands as an adventure in its own right, but also beckons the reader on to the rest of the trilogy. <br />The protagonist, Cory Maddox undergoes plenty of transformation in this story, running through several life &quot;phases&quot; while trying to sort out who to trust. One of the enjoyable features of this series is that the reader is never quite certain who he should trust, either. Often, I found myself wanting to urge Cory &amp; Riki to trust the wrong (in hindsight) characters.<br />Plenty here for either the SF or fantasy fan. Thoroughly enjoyable--Chalker knows how to entertain while stretching the mind and imagination. Perhaps the worst feature of this book is that the 3rd book of the trilogy is so difficult to obtain.<br />A solid four-star rating: great fun, but not absolute genius.	2001-05-12

He uses Ernesto Blanco, a returned Che Guevara, to proclaim the principles of deep democracy and &quot;The True Republic.&quot; In a contrived situation where Fidel has stepped down from power and the power-mongers of the Left and Right are scrapping over the spoils, Ernesto travels from village to village, speaking with people about taking the power back. Rather than an armed revolutionary struggle, Blanco proclaims a gospel of democratic ideals.<br />As far as suspense &amp; thrill, this book is no Ludlum. But the simple, deep Democracy for which Blanco evangelizes is strangely compelling. Power belongs to the people. The local people can make better decisions about their needs than either centralized corporate power or centralized big government. Blackthorn has written the easy part of the story, a tale of an idea, spreading like wildfire through a fictional Cuba. Far more impressive would be a tale of this True Republic movement being implemented in these United States. <br />I began to feel that this wasn't a novel about Cuba or about Che Guevara, but rather that it was an attempt to stimulate political thought and dialogue. What have we, the American people done with our political power? We have become so absorbed in the trivialities of our daily lives that we have abandoned our power to whomever will take it-and those who have accepted political power have been no more trustworthy than Blackthorn's mafiosi or apparatchik. Blackthorn continuously reminds the reader that power belongs to &quot;the people.&quot; It is only upon further consideration that the reader realizes that power does not belong to some other &quot;people,&quot; political power belongs to the reader, but it has been abdicated for so long that now it must be struggled for. <br />The Cuban setting is well researched as are the statements of Ernesto Blanco (based on Che Guevarra's diaries).I give this book five stars for a being a great fable, four stars for entertainment value. Get it. Read it. Pass it on. And then, maybe, we'll get to see an Authentic Republic in these United States.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue further about this book, click the &quot;about me&quot; link above to drop me an email.

It does, however, throw down the gauntlet to those who claim to be Christians, yet expect their &quot;god&quot; to be reasonable &amp; practical. The Reverend Doctor Wilkinson springboards off an obscure text in the &quot;begats&quot; to challenge believers to actually =BELIEVE= instead of settling for their own limitations:<br />LITTLE PRAYER, GIANT PRIZE<br />&quot;Jabez was more honorable than his brothers, and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, 'Because I bore him in pain.' And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, 'Oh that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be  with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!' So God granted him what he requested.&quot; (I Chronicles 4:9-10)<br />As Wilkinson puts it &quot;Things started badly for a person no one had ever heard of. He prayed an unusual, one-sentence prayer. Things ended extraordinarily well.&quot;<br />SO WHY NOT ASK?<br />In chapter two, Wilkinson challenges the believer to &quot;think different&quot;. Most of us are conditioned to accept limits and never think outside the box. Why not ask God to bless us? Why not ask God to take us beyond the possible and the practical? He reminds us that God's nature is to bless and that His bounty is limited only our lack of asking--not by the constraints we imagine.<br />LIVING LARGE FOR GOD<br />Wilkinson imagines Jabez looking at his circumstances and concluding &quot;Surely I was born for more than this!&quot; He challenges Christians to stop settling for what is simple, what is convenient, what is practical, and to ask God to move the boundary lines, to enlarge their lives for Him. He presents the equation: &quot;My willingness and weakness + God's will and supernatural power = my expanded territory&quot;.<br />THE TOUCH OF GREATNESS<br />In this fourth chapter, Wilkinson challenges the feelings of inadequacy that often come after entering enlarged territory. This, he states, is =DEPENDANCY=, being forced to rely on God instead of on one's own wits and resources.<br />KEEPING THE LEGACY SAFE<br />Here Wilkinson teaches that Christians ought not to ask merely for power to overcome temptation, but should ask to avoid temptation entirely. Being delivered from evil means staying well away from sin, not testing borders. A second point he makes is that Satanic opposition is to be expected by those praying and living the Jabez prayer. When believers are oppressed and opposed, this should not be a point of fear, but an indicator that they are on the right path.<br />WELCOME TO GOD'S HONOR ROLL<br />Wilkinson examines the effect of praying the Jabez prayer in his own life. He points out how &quot;expanded territory&quot; leads to praying for even more blessings and brings an even greater territorial expansion. The only thing that can break this cycle of blessing is sin, which breaks the flow of God's power.<br />MAKING JABEZ MINE<br />He concludes the book with this little challenge: Pray this prayer each morning and keep a record on a calendar or chart; write the prayer where you can see it and be reminded of it; reread his book each week for a month (it's handy, 7 chapters of the book, 7 days of the week); tell another person of this commitment; keep a record of changes; start praying the Jabez prayer for family and church.<br />CONCLUSION &amp; CRITIQUE<br />I ran across this book when my spiritual life was being challenged to look beyond the expected and expect the abundance available to me. This is a great Promise Keeper book. It buys into the middle American mindset but challenges it with the evangelical version of Biblical piety. Most Christians that I've known need the challenges in this book. It's too easy to settle for the practical, rather than inviting Divine transformation of your world and worldview.<br />Again, this is basically a 7 part inspirational sermon on paper, it is not a scholarly piece of Biblical exegesis. Those who complain about the context of genocide miss the entire point of the book. I find one basic flaw in the book, however, it avoids important Biblical social teachings. Wilkinson singles out pornography, divorce, infidelity, the American emphases on rights and freedom as defects. While decrying these sins, he avoids the structural injustices that lead to poverty, homelessness, and oppression.

It's too easy to settle for the practical, rather than inviting Divine transformation of your world and worldview. <br />Again, this is basically a 7 part inspirational sermon on paper, it is not a scholarly piece of Biblical exegesis. Those who complain about the context of genocide miss the entire point of the book. I find one basic flaw in the book, however, it avoids important Biblical social teachings. Wilkinson singles out pornography, divorce, infidelity, the American emphases on rights and freedom as defects. While decrying these sins, he avoids the structural injustices that lead to poverty, homelessness, and oppression.

Three of her eight chapters give us an overview of the nordic cosmos and themes, the rest tell us stories of the deities. <br />Odin and Thor each get their own chapters, as well as sharing a chapter on their attributes as underworld deities. Freyr and Freya also receive a chapter dedicated (mostly) to them as fertility deities. Yet another chapter considers sea deities, and a catch-all chapter discusses the remaining gods. <br />Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of this overview is Davidson's failure to discuss the differences between the Aesir and the Vanir. Although these are pointed out, the significance is not discussed in detail. Could the warrior cult of the Aesir have edged out the fertility cult of the Vanir during the chilling of the climate that has taken place over the past 2,500 years or so? Does this competition reflect the Indo-Kurgan invasions that Gimbutas wrote about, where we see the gods of the victors gaining supremacy over the deities of the conquered? What of the giants? Do they represent deeper, primal forces and archetypes? Or are they the gods of yet an earlier culture? <br />Those who seek a &quot;Norse&quot; Wicca, will do well to read about the Vanir, Freyr &amp; Freyja. This chapter lays out a nice outline of the nordic fertility tradition (which is congruent with Wicca, unlike the battle tradition of Odin &amp; Thor). Davidson discusses the roles of the &quot;volva&quot; or witches/seers and their magic or &quot;seithr.&quot; <br />This is an excellent comprehensive overview for somebody who would like an introduction to the Norse Mythos. It should be followed by Metzner's Well of Remembrance (sorts out Aesir and Vanir issues, as well as shamanic practices) and Crossley-Holland's Norse Myths (retells the myths). Then, the serious student ought to dive into the Eddas themselves. <br />(For further discussion, click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me a line. Thanks!)	2001-04-24

This was the first &quot;meaningful&quot; short story I ever remember reading. Symbols &amp; metaphors came alive--I concluded (and I remember this over 20 years later) that &quot;society always crucifies its messiahs.&quot; I couldn't leave it alone after that. I hunted down my own copy of Welcome to the Monkey House. <br />If you're not ready to tackle one of Vonnegut's novels, take a shot at this collection of stories. Each one is a gem, faceted to challenge the spectrum of your thoughts. Not a book I recommend to &quot;staid&quot; folks, unless I want to see them shaken.	2001-04-24

Lady Doreen presents a form of the Craft true to its Wiccan roots, but does so without violating her oaths. &quot;This book is simply intended to aid those who want to worship the Old Gods and make magic in the old ways. The desire to do this has become so widespread that I feel it should no longer be denied.&quot; She offers her book as a starting point, even for those who must self-initiate.<br />The book consists of two sections, The first is divided into eleven chapters: The Old Gods (watch out for some material here that is no longer taken seriously by scholars), Witch Ethics, Witch Festivals, Witch Signs and Symbols, The Magic Circle, Witch Tools, Methods of Witch Divination, Witches' Attire, The Witches' Alphabets, The Working Site, and Witchcraft and Sex Magic. <br />The second section is Liber Umbrarum, A Book of Shadows. Herein will be found Casting the Circle; The Rite of Self-Initiation; The Full Moon Esbat Rite; The Sabbat Rite; Initiation into the Coven; The Coven Spell; The Seven Pointed Star; The Runes of Andred; The Spell of the Cord; Invocation of the Moon Goddess; Invocation of the Horned God; and Chants and Dances. <br />The book includes a broad spectrum bibliography and and a useful index. Although other authors have published material directly from traditional Books of Shadows, Lady Doreen's book presents material taht may be useufl to the solitary practitioner as well as the coven. Although this book requires more thought than a Cunningham book, I find it more solidly grounded in Wiccan tradition. Well worth the extra brain work.	2001-04-20

Personal failure gives way to blame rather than growth. A life gets ruined by resentment. The fable teaches obvious lessons about servant leadership and explores deeper themes of life in the face of dissapointment and the layers of initiation. <br />As with much of Hesse's work, no simple explanation of this book will do it justice. Sometimes obtuse, sometimes obvious, its 117 pages speak of longing and frustration, and culminate in an ending Hollywood could never accept. Rather than image-building visual descriptions, Hesse evokes arcane shadows with vague references to the heroic and the mystical. Those who know of kunalini or Golden Dawn, may feel slightly more at home here than the complete neophyte, but this story is accessible to all.<br />Five stars for a tour de force on longing, disappointment and resentment. Five stars for telling a story that flies below the ego's radar. Five stars for essential knowledge of the human condition and unveiling the naked emperor of so many modern spiritual fads.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue further about this review, please click the &quot;about me&quot; link above to get my email address.

Poetic forms and &quot;nonsense&quot; rhymes merge with adult loves. Even in these &quot;children's poems,&quot; Lorca's affair with the theme of death emerges, in poems like The Rider's Song:<br />Cordova. / Distant ... alone.<br />Black mare, big moon, / olives in my saddlebags. / Though I may know the roads / I'll never arrive in Cordova.<br />Through the plains, through the wind, / black mare, red moon. / Death is watching me / from the towers of Cordova.<br />Aii how long the road is! / Aii my valiant mare! / Aii Death that waits for me / before I get to Cordova!<br />Cordova. / Distant ... alone.<br />I don't particularly like Will Kirkland's translation. Frequently, he translates &quot;Ay&quot; as &quot;Aii,&quot; when an English &quot;Oh&quot; seems more appropriate. In the example above, &quot;Aii how long the road is&quot; would read better &quot;Oh, how long the road is.&quot; In many instances, the technically correct translation loses the poetry of the original Spanish. I wish more attention had been paid to retaining the poetics, even, perhaps at the expense of a literal translation. Maria Horvath's illustrations are quaint, reminiscent of a bygone era.<br />Five stars for content, four stars for translation &amp; illustration. Don't get it for your children, get it for yourself.

He demurred, but gave me a reading list, with this book at the top. I started reading WHAT WITCHES DO on a cross-country business trip. Within the first chapter I was hooked. This had the ring of authenticity that I was seeking. <br />Farrar's book provides a good introduction to the British Traditional Craft. It presents an overview without assuming that the reader already knows anything about Wicca. A great book to give to somebody open-minded who wants to understand the traditional craft. If reading this book leaves you salivating for more, Stewart &amp; his wife Janet have written THE WITCHES WAY and EIGHT SABBATS FOR WITCHES. These contain more than enough information to satisfy those interested in more details.	2001-04-17

Andrews pretentious, Wannabe Indian schlock. Jennifer Talldeer, Lackey's heroine, acquits herself well in this novel. Evildoers get stopped, the world is saved, and the reader has fun. Occult mind-candy fiction, but it's =GOOD= candy, not the cheap kind that comes 99 cents/pound and has a bad aftertaste.<br />While the situations in this book get favorably resolved, this novel begs the question of our &quot;real&quot; world, in which Native Americans suffer privation, discrimination, and illegal/unjust imprisonment. If you take pleasure in reading this story, you owe it to the &quot;real&quot; characters, people like Leonard Peltier, to learn their stories. Jennifer Talldeer hasn't been able to get Leonard justice--she's not &quot;real.&quot; But Leonard's cell in Leavenworth is very real. If you doubt that, get his Prison Writings, and step from Lackey's fantasy into his nightmare. <br />Have you read Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee yet? Matthiesen's In the Spirit of Crazy Horse? Or even Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States? Sure. Enjoy the mind candy. But feed your soul with something more nutritious.

Although based on characters created by the Bible, those who seek anything other than a deeper appreciation of life in Patriarchal Times (as opposed to patriarchal times--in which we still live), will be disappointed if not outraged. If you cannot set aside (at least long enough to enjoy this book) your knowledge of how the stories surrounding Jacob's family &quot;really&quot; happened, do not pick this book up, it will frustrate you.] <br />This poignant tale of community built and then unraveled, showcases solid research about life in the ancient near east. Although characters originate in the Bible, their behaviors are frequently explained far differently than in the corresponding Biblical stories. My recurrent response was &quot;that's not how I thought it happened, but it's not an impossible explanation.&quot; <br />This didn't distract for long, however. Diamante writes to connect with the heart, not just boggle the mind. We become entranced, sucked into the community of Laban's daughters. We find their experiences awakening our own longings to connect. As the novel progresses, we feel the torn fabric of our own community in Dinah's tragedy and isolation. <br />Listen, guys, you who always complain that women cannot be understood--read this book! If you don't get it, read it again. And again. Reflect on the men in this book. Reflect on how their lives impacted the women around them. CONSIDER YOUR LIFE IN THIS LIGHT. Or, continue grousing over your lite beer. Keep on complaining about women to your buddies at the sports bar. Perhaps that =IS= more satisfying, after all. <br />Five stars for a great story. Five stars for handling &quot;historical&quot; material fairly &amp; with novelty. Five stars for research (I've read a bit on the ancient near east &amp; this this novel doesn't contradict any of it).

Indices allow studying material by disorder type, or the book can be worked through from the beginning.

Normally, I would give a Clancy novel 3 to 5 stars. This one, however, doesn't deserve that many. <br />In order to showcase elite anti-terrorist training, he invents a bunch of eco-terrorists, modeled after the Red Brigades of decades past. Clancy uses this vehicle to preach the anti-environmentalist rhetoric that our current &quot;president&quot; espouses. While I have not come to expect a progressive, or even a &quot;Liberal&quot; viewpoint from Clancy, it surprises me that he stooped to illegitimate smear tactics. Had he bothered to do even a little bit of research, he would have found that eco-terrorism is a construct perpetrated only by those who wish to marginalize the environmentally concerned. Congratulations, Mr. Clancy, you have continued the smear campaign. Your Corporate Masters must be quite proud of you. <br />The novel is too long--I got the impression he was getting paid by the word. The action scenes continue to be dramatic although formulaic. This will probably be the last Clancy book I read--he isn't producing anything really new, but I can return to Patriot Games, Hunt for Red October, and Without Remorse; although perhaps Mr. Bush will make Red Storm Rising relevant again.<br />Three stars for story, none for character development, negative stars for becoming a propoganda instrument. If I could give fewer than one star, I would.

Galloway writes as an experienced runner and coach. He provides training programs for most levels of fitness and experience. If you want to run, or continue running without injury, take the time to read this book. <br />The first  section of the book, \\"Starting,\\" provides a brief history of running, then moves into five stages of running development (Beginner, Jogger, Competitor, Athlete, Runner). <br />The second section, \\"Training,\\" considers the physiology of running, planning a training program (including \\"running slow in order to run fast\\"), and keeping a log. This section concludes with an discussion about the need for rest and training programs.<br />The third section, \\"Racing,\\" talks about how to run faster, how to adjust your pace on the race day, how to handle different lengths of races (these include specific training programs), and how to prepare for a marathon. A final chapter considers issues for the advanced competititve runner.<br />Section four, \\"Tuning,\\" presents augmentations to a strong running program, including form, stretching & strengthening, running drills, will power, and a chapter on women' running, written by the author's wife.<br />The book continues with shorter sections, on injuries, nutrition and diet, shoes, and age issues. An appendix contains references, a reading list, and race pace charts. The book has an adequate index.<br />If you read Runner's World for a few years, you'll encounter much of this information.

Charles Leland set out to record as much about Strega, the Italian witchcraft tradition. As is typical of many other folk traditions in western culture, it incorporates many aspects of the Judeo-Christian tradition. This book impacted contemporary Wicca in one powerful way: it presented the basis for the first portion of \\"The Charge of the Goddess.\\" Leland also put forward the claim, echoed by Gerald Gardner, that strega, the Old Religion, had its roots in ancient, pre-Christian religions. <br />Modern Wiccans will find this view of magic and craft interesting. Some practices, such as \\"forcing\\" deities to do the bidding of mortals, seem to be radically less prevalent now. Although some Wiccan traditions (Reclaiming, for one) espouse political activism, the violent class-war material presented here also will seem out of place. <br />An interesting bit of reading, showcasing a very different view of the world than most currently Wiccans share. More important reading than the latest \\"tradition\\" of the day to hit the shelves. A more scholarly, expanded edition has recently been published. I look forward to reading it and seeing what light it casts on this material.	2001-04-13

Lackey spins a great yarn, keeping basic neo-Pagan principles straight, and is one of the few authors who realizes that modern Witches aren't a bunch of blood-licking satan-worshipping child-sacrificers. <br />Beyond belief systems, Lackey can spin a yarn that keeps the reader entertained. This book is no exception. Easy to get into, enough suspense to keep it engrossing, and a sense of satisfaction at the end. Good, occult fun!<br />If you'd like to read something a bit meatier, however, consider the occult novels of Dion Fortune, particularly the Sea Priestess and Moon Magic.

Granted, one can list features &amp; salient points, but no collection of words can pass on the joyful experience of watching a butterfly alight upon a buttercup on a warm spring afternoon. <br />No better description than the one on the cover: &quot;a tale--partly about life, partly about revolution and lots about hope for adults and others (including caterpillars who can read)&quot;. <br />Once again I find myself at a place in life where the struggle to climb to the top of the heap overwhelms me on a daily basis. Once again, I needed to take this book off the shelf (I have several copies--any time I see one at a garage sale or used book store, I buy it--ready to give away), blow away the dust, and inhale the refreshing message of liberation.<br />Hope for the Flowers does more to puncture bourgeois denial than any Marxist treatise ever could. It cuts to the radical more deeply than the Anarchists can approach.

David Schnarch has created something quite different. This book focuses on using conflict within the couple to create the growth necessary for partners to relate to each other. The book balances a well written presentation of psychological theory with anectdotal examples of how it manifests in couples. <br />The root of marital conflict is not failure to communicate. Rather, it is accurate communication between incompletely individuated people. Individuation means the ability to connect with another, even in conflict, without losing one's own sense of self. When individuation is lacking, members of a couple must find ways to keep their distance from their partners in order not to lose their sense of self. This distancing is the root of marital (or other committed couple) discord.<br />Schnarch uses the forum of the couple to challenge each individual to develop a stronger, less contingent sense of self. The very institution that produces anxiety--the relationship--becomes the mechanism of repair! He postulates that couples only form between individuals who are similarly individuated. As one member of the couple develops, it challenges the other. The two partners \\"leapfrog\\" in their development, continually challenging the other. <br />I've been married for 15 1/2 years. We spent the last three years (we're slow learners) working with a therapist who subcribes to Schnarch's ideas. After many, many wasted dollars with other therapists (we learned all the nice communication techniques, with no improvement in our couplehood), we've finally begun to develop a sense of intimacy in our relationship. This stuff WORKS!<br />For those who'd like a more theoretical background on the material, Schnarch's THE SEXUAL CRUCIBLE is an incredible reference work. It contains the theoretical material found here, but instead of anectdotes about people living the material, it pulls in reams academic material to refute other theories and buttress Schnarch's.<br />Five stars for breaking new ground. Five stars for making key psychological theories accessible. Five stars for importance. If you're in a relationship, and you think it could be better--get this book! It can be!<br />(	2001-04-12

The greatest disappointment of this book was that it ended before the weekend &amp; I had no sequel! <br />&quot;On August 23, the day before the hurricane struck, Max and Bonnie Lamb awoke early, made love twiece and rode the shuttle bus to Disney World.&quot; So begins this marvelously improbably tale which weaves together the paths of newlyweds, cons, thugs, and a living-off-the-land, scraggly haired ex-governor. Easy to pick up and slide into, difficult to put down, this romp into Hurricane Andrew's wake tosses quirky characters into chaos. Not as extreme as Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Adams), more of a down-home Good Omens (Pratchett &amp; Gaiman) without devils or angels. <br />Character development is not intense, but the contrived situations that bring those characters to light actually seem plausible. Fewer laughs in this book and more subconscious chuckles. If you want something traditional &amp; predictable, leave this one on the shelf and go buy Grisham or Clancy. But if a road-kill scavenging, toad-licking ex-governor piques your curiousity (and he's a much better guardian of the land than our current &quot;president&quot;), grant serious consideration to this book! <br />Five stars for creating an extremely improbable story and making it seem as natural as a tale about the Springfield 'burbs!

The peace-loving agrarians of Milagro find themselves oppressed by the city slickers &amp; suits who draw up water-compacts &amp; grazing regulations. Slowly, but certainly, they're being squeezed off their ancestral lands, having their buccolic lifestyle eroded by the landed, the government, and the wealthy. <br />But this is not a grim, revolutionary novel, full of dogma and bloodshed. It's a tale of a bunch of characters, who really just want to be left alone, backed against the wall and making their last stand. <br />Who couldn't cheer for Cleofas or Joe Mondragon? Who doesn't want to drop El Zopilote into the Rio Grande with cement shoes? The protagonists seduce you into their stories, and their enemies are disgusting precisely because they are so removed, because they are so ordinary, so boring. <br />Nichols demonstrates to us that authentic people work the land, work their jobs, lead their lives, and that their lives are worthy of storytelling. In our dominator culture, the wealthy are the powerful. Their lives, while pampered &amp; protected, are dull, uninteresting. We only care about them when our heroes stop bending over for them and say &quot;enough is enough.&quot; Look deeply within yourself &amp; see just how much of Joe Mondragon you carry. Now, log off the internet &amp; see if you can live a life worthy of Milagro. <br />Five stars for characterization. Five stars of making a tired plot (underdogs vs. oppressors) so much fun. Five stars for a gentle, funny read that worms its way into your heart.<br />(If you'd like to comment on this review, click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; email me. Thanks!)	2001-04-09

When I first read early manuscripts of book, on July 2, 1983, my view of the cosmos utterly shifted. I have never been the same since.

This stew of Templar magic, William Wallace, Longshanks &amp; Robert the Bruce, hold enough interest to finish the book. I'm not a Celtic scholar, but it sounds like Kurtz &amp; Harris have done their homework. They certainly don't resort to some of the wildly unbelievable fantasies that meander through the movie Braveheart.<br />It disappoints me that, yet again, this duo has chosen to demonize the religions of pre-Christian Europe. While finding bright light in their Christian/Templar/Masonic magic, they elaborate the darkest forces in the Old Religion. They neglect the fact that the equalitarianism of Celtic culture provided one of the few bright lights of a more democratic process than the totalitarianism which so characterized medieval Christianity. Celtic Christianity did, indeed, shine like a light in those dark ages, not inspite of the dark religions they had forsaken, but precisely because their pre-Christian religions were so full of light, celebration, and lie-affirming beliefs and celebrations.<br />Overall, it was an enoyable book. Plenty of action, although a bit formulaic. The magical &amp; occult material is not as rich as that found in Dion Fortune's novels, but this book is much more readable. If you're a die-hard Adept fan, you will want to read this book to experience more of the Saint Clair story.<br />Fun, longer than it is deep, perhaps even historically accurate. Doesn't quite make it to 4 stars, though. It gets 3.5 stars, rounded down because it felt a bit tired.<br />(If you would like to correspond about this review, please click the &quot;about me&quot; link above. Thanks!)	2001-04-06

He never offers a moment's peace for couch-potato complacency. &quot;Freedom is not made up principally of privileges; it is made up especially of duties.&quot;  (p. 96)<br />To read these essays is to step into the world of a man who said to Christians &quot;I share with you the same revulsion from evil. But I do not share your hope, and I continue to struggle against this universe in which children suffer and die.&quot; (p. 71) And &quot;Perhaps we cannot prevent this world from being a world in which children are tortured. But we can reduce the number of tortured children.&quot; (p. 73)<br />Camus is recalled to the podium, in a day when children are tortured and die in Chiapas while most turn a blind eye and complain that sitcoms just aren't what they used to be. These essays, possibly his most accessible work, demand an active response from the modern reader. Our struggle today, although not against Nazi minions, still must echo his &quot;There are means that cannot be excused. I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice.&quot; (p. 5) [See Jamal's Live from Death Row and Peltier's Prison Writings, elsewhere on Amazon.]<br />Camus is outspoken about capital punishment, too. &quot;It is obviously no less repulsive than the crime, and this new murder, far from making amends for the harm done to the social body, adds a new blot to the first one.&quot; (p. 176) His &quot;Reflections on the Guillotine&quot; is the longest essay in book. He views capital punishment, even in &quot;free&quot; societies, as an act of totalitarianism.<br />Camus proclaims the call to justice and the struggle for freedom found in the Old Testament, especially in the minor prophets. But he does so in a modern context, where God is silent and man is the maker of his own destiny. Although he sees no messianic age, he proclims the hope that by continuous effort evil can be diminished and freedom and justice may become more prevalent.<br />Five stars for courage, five stars for clarity, five stars for consistency.

Graft in a bit of Hitler and the Spanish Inquisition. Now you have the setting for this story. America has become a theocracy controlled by Nehemiah Scudder, a corrupt &amp; hypocritical &quot;prophet.&quot; This book showcases Heinlein's commitment to individual liberties. Writing during the shame of the McCarthy era Communist hunts, Heinlein wrote a story that damned the political repression of his own era and continues to inspire freedom loving people even now. <br />It's a simple story line. Naive boy meets forbidden girl. Boy contracts near fatal case of puppy love. Boy &amp; girl must escape intolerable situation. Boy &amp; girl join the underground (literally) resistance. Each matures &amp; moves on. A revolution ensues. During this physical journey into manhood, John Lyle (the hero) must also take a spiritual journey, one in which he disentangles himself from mental slavery and becomes a free and free-thinking man. <br />Five stars for ideology &amp; political courage.

They do this so that they know what to believe and what not to believe. This is very curious.&quot; (p. 93) This &quot;autobiographical&quot; novel challenges us with the nature of reality. Do we take seriously the naively precocious narration of young Jeanette, brought up in a social &quot;reality&quot; most readers would find suspect? Whose eyes tell us the truth? Even when the narrative breaks into the mythological, truth dances tantalizingly out of the shadows, but still evades, no matter how we try to seduce it. <br />If nothing else (and it is =MUCH= else), we encounter our own challenge of existing within social constraints that seemingly resist our attempts to alter them. In the young Jeanette we reflect on the naivete of one who does not recognize any other way to be, who only eats oranges, who cannot really imagine living outside the lines. <br />Jeanette grows up, finds love and discovers that her love receives no approbation from her family or community. Her love mobilizes all the &quot;Holy&quot; to try to fit her back into their mold for her life. As she matures, the story becomes less certain, more questioning of itself. Increasingly, we encounter interludes of mythological material, which move the story along, exposing even a deeper truth.<br />And perhaps that upsets the fruitbasket entirely. Jeanette's mother is virtually unbelievable. I would consider her two-dimensional, except I've met her. Well, not that same woman, but her spiritual twin. And in real life, she was two-dimensional, at best. Truth, so cleaned &amp; dried &amp; pressed becomes surreal, and what little bit of &quot;reality&quot; remains maps into a mere two dimensions. Flattens. And Jeanette's young life is so flattened, that only the trauma of forbidden love can give her depth. But even that cannot be told in mere words, it must be shown in yet another layer of story, lest truth escape disguising itself as language. <br />A magnificent book, and a fun read. Fast. Best read twice, in rapid succession.	2001-04-02

The useless ones I get rid of. This is one of the few I've actually read more than once. It contains quality material and makes an excellent first or second book for somebody new to the Craft. <br />Vivianne takes Wiccan tradition seriously, and doesn't cheapen it by making wild &amp; unsubstantiated claims. She introduces her own material and names it as such. This book is complete. Rituals, directions, poems &amp; liturgy. Everything you need but a coven, a calling and a connecttion to the Goddess. <br />Not only does this book describe Wiccan practice, but it describes it in sociological, historical, and psychological context, too. It is an example of applied Jungian theory. She uses the psychology of Carl Jung to explain the sense behind magic and Craft rituals.  She bats around phrases like &quot;Our Gods are the archetypal forces which inhabit the collective unconscious.&quot; To the question of &quot;Are the forms of the Gods 'real'?&quot; she answers first with a quote of Jung &quot;they are images of contents which for the most part transcend consciousness.&quot; and then adds &quot;what lies beyond the images is a divine reality ... true experessions of the nature of the divine translated into human terms.&quot;<br />This book contains a great deal of Craft practice, along with solid, original thought. Index, footnotes, a bibliography and a glossary round it out. A magnificent effort--more than earns its five stars! Every Witch ought to have read this book at least once!	2001-04-02

Much of the quality material can be traced back to Gardnerian roots. This book is a rare gem--a reliable and modern source for non-Gardnerian British Craft material. Doreen Valiente, an important figure in Wicca, wrote with Evan Jones about the practice of the Craft after Robert Cochrane's style. <br />While this book does not hold many &quot;spell recipes&quot; or &quot;ritual scripts,&quot; it provides enough information to &quot;produce&quot; rituals in this style &amp; to organize a coven. This begs the question, however, of whether or not the Craft may be handed down through books or not. <br />The Goddess knows Her own, and to Herself She will call them.

One that changes your perceptions of the world around you, loosens your inhibitions or cripples your ability to do anything? Kay Redfield Jamison pours out her experience of living with a mood disorder, using descriptive, image-evoking prose. <br />This book contains her life story, told from the point, not just of a disease sufferer, but also from the standpoint of a healer. Dr. Jamison is both. As a psychotherapist &amp; professor of psychiatry, not only did she write a definitive book on the treatment of manic-depressive illness, but she also suffers from the disease herself.<br />We read her first-person account of how the disease snuck into her life. How parts of it were seductive and alluring, how she enjoyed having the extra energy, the industry; but also how that energy would turn to mania, would be damaging. Then we learn how dark, how bleak the downs could be. She exposes her struggle with medication, how she felt it limited her, how difficult it was to find and maintain the correct dose. We learn about the impact of her disease on her relationships. <br />She examines the path of manic-depressive illness in her life and paints a picture for the reader. One cannot put this book down without being touched. If you, or somebody you know, suffers from a mood disorder, this book is =REQUIRED= reading. If you would like a deep insightful read, not only will you enjoy this book, but you'll come away from it with a new appreciation for living with a chemically balanced brain.	2001-03-30

I found this transition pleasant &amp; stimulating. Buffet knows how to drag the reader from the comfortably familiar (or the unexperienced-but-imaginable) into deeper waters, all the while providing enough support that the reader doesn't drown in weirdness. <br />Although the novel ventures into some wild &amp; uncharted territories, one of the scenes regards an area with which I'm quite familiar. Desdemona makes love with an operator of the Arecibo Observatory under their magnificent radio-telescope (&amp; radar) dish antenna (The movie Contact will give you some great visuals of this place if you need them). He nails the description of the site solidly. He's been there (and under the dish isn't part of the tour) or he's cribbing off somebody who has. I can only speculate that he knows the other off-the-beaten-path places as well. <br />5 stars for novelty, 5 stars for fun. If you want a novel that stays firmly grounded in middle-America, pass this one by, but if you have a sense of adventure, a hankering to pirate around the Carribean in an old sea plane, or just want to expand your mind a bit, relish the experience of reading this one!	2001-03-29

I have read many of the books he refers to in this novel. I have tried this novel on for size three times. Each time I bog down between 60% &amp; 80% of the way through. Each time I finish it anyways. I find this his most disappointing novel. <br />He begins to develop a great story line, valiant intellectual warriors running from an unknown menace. They demonstrate their ingenuity and adaptivity to rapidly changing situations. As the pages turn, the story departs further and further from it's beginnings and mutates into a reality hopping, story jumping house-that-Jack-built of a book. The characters become less interesting as we realize that little new about them will unfold as Heinlein indulges his fascination with hopping through the space-time axes into alternate fictons. I also find him a bit preachier than he is in most of his novels, especially about gender roles. Sigh. <br />This book is only for the die-hard Heinlein fan. There are plenty of other great reality tweaking books out there. Robert Anton Wilson's Schroedinger's Cat comes immediately to mind. Jack Chalker has written a number of them. <br />(If you enjoyed this review, please leave positive feedback. If you feel it besmirches the Master of SF, then email me.

In conjunction with Samuel Noah Kramer, a noted scholar on Sumer, she works with the subleties and ambiguities of the texts to reveal experiences long ago pressed into clay and forgotten. <br />This book is a collection of stories &amp; hymns, translated from the cuneiform by Kramer. Wolkenstein, an expert in folktales, mythology, &amp; storytelling, worked with his translations to craft an essence of the myths that reads coherently; confronting the reader with stories that are at once archaic and contemporary.<br />Numerous relief images from ancient Sumer enhance the &quot;otherness&quot; of the text. Rhythms and repetitive lineation loudly proclaim the exotic nature of this sacred poetry. And yet, at the heart of these stories, lie essential &amp; archetypal material, which underlies the lives of each of us. I like this feature of the book best--I can read these ancient hymns and find a resonance within my modern soul. Wolkenstein and Kramer have well accomplished what they set out to do. <br />One notable feature of this poetry is the erotic content. Whether veiled in metaphor:<br />&quot;At the king's lap stood the rising cedar.&quot;<br />or explicit:<br />&quot;As for me, Inanna, / Who will plow my vulva? / Who will plow my high field? / Who will plow my wet ground?&quot;<br />this erotic sacred literature of a vanished people stands in stark contrast to the purified verses of the canonical Judeo-Christian scriptures. Long before religion villified sexuality, we read--we experience in this poetry--that it was an honored sacrament, inseparable from spirituality. <br />The book concludes with chapters on Sumerian history, commentary on the material and translation, notes on the artwork, and a bibliography for further research. It contains an useful index.<br />This book is appropriate as a translated primary source for undergraduate work about the ancient Near East or mythology. It is a great source for those seeking to explore (and reclaim) the history of the Goddess, and for those who just can't get enough good Sumerian poetry! Five stars for an excellent balance of the literary with the scholarly, for breathing new life into a lost tradition. <br />(If you enjoyed this review, please leave positive feedback.

Lady Doreen was there for key moments--without her finesse, the Charge of the Goddess would likely be an obscure  and arcane document, used only by Gardnerian &amp; related Wiccan traditions. She took much of Gardner's material and transformed it from awkward, ponderous prose, to liturgical poetry. <br />She reminds us that the last witchcraft trial in England took place in 1944, at the Old Bailey. One Helen Duncan, a spiritualist medium, was found guilty under the Witchcraft Act of 1735 and sentenced to 9 months in jail. It was not until June of 1951 that this law was abolished. That July, a newspaper carried a frontpage story, CALLING ALL COVENS, describing a forthcoming witches' gathering, opened by Gerald B. Gardner. <br />She traces the forerunners of the Craft: Charles Godfrey Leland, Margaret Murray, Robert Graves, Dion Fortune, and Aleister Crowley. From this she moves on to Gerald Gardner, and how he came to publicize the Craft. This is followed by a chapter about what it was like working with Old Gerald and one regarding what the intense publicity Gerald generated was like. She writes chapters about John Brakespeare, Robert Cochrane, and Alex Sanders and their traditions. <br />She points out that during this time period, witchcraft was male dominated, certainly not feminist. Women were allowed to hold fancy titles, like Witch Queen, but stil expected to obey the high priest. Her chapter on Feminist Witchcraft tells of Starhawk meeting up with Zuzanna Budapest, considers women's moon mysteries, and the place of homosexuality in the Craft. <br />She concludes the book by observing that the emergence of the Craft in modern times must be fulfilling a deep need. <br />Lady Doreen is a good writer and the material is interesting. Many of the founders of traditions the &quot;inherited&quot; were real characters, and she sprinkles a generous number of anecdotes throughout the book. <br />The book has a reasonably good bibliography for anybody who wishes to do further research. Serious research into the history of the Craft would also include reading Aidan Kelly's Crafting the Art of Magic, a critical exploration of Gardner's Witchcraft. <br />(If you enjoyed this review, please leave positive feedback.

Much of the Craft today, in its diverse forms, owes its existence to the original work of Gerald Gardner. <br />Aidan Kelly takes a critical look at the source material for Gerald Gardner's teachings about the craft. This is an excellent textual criticism of the Gardnerian materials. I cannot fault him for his work with &quot;original&quot; documents. I doubt we will ever learn more about when things were written, and from where they were lifted, than Dr. Kelly has presented in his book.<br />One of the most interesting evolutions is that of the Charge of the Goddess. On p. 52 he presents Gardner's original, a redacted bit of Leland &amp; Crowley. It reads like a hack. This was its state between 1949 &amp; 1953. On p. 114 he presents the Charge, essentially as we know it today, after Doreen Valiente (see my review of her The Rebirth of Witchcraft) had helped him rewrite it. On p. 162 he presents a verse form of of the Charge from 1961, a quintain adaptation of Dorreen's quatrain form (not included). <br />Kelly argues that nothing in the Craft pre-existed Gardner. He attempts to explain the creation of the Craft as Gerald's way of manipulating strong women into spanking him for sexual gratification. While I find his critical analysis compelling, his theory about Gardner's sexuality seems to be a long reach. <br />This book is required reading for anybody interested in the history of the Craft. If nothing else it helps decrease the number of times Wannabe Witch utters &quot;Yes, our traditions go back for =THOUSANDS= of years...&quot; While the Goddess may have been worshipped since time immemorial, Kelly makes a good case that She has only been worshipped in this particular Wiccan way since the late 1930's at best.<br />(If you enjoyed this review please leave me positive feedback.

Isaac Bonewitz graduated from Cal Berkeley in 1970 with a BA in magic and thaumaturgy. This book is not a grimoire of arcane spells and occult symbols. No recipes calling for &quot;eye of Newt&quot; will be found within. This is a systematic attempt to study, categorize, and perhaps even explain the phenomena of magic, from ESP to Eastern ritual. <br />Bonewitz does not write a superstitious text. He claims &quot;I am not anti-scientific... What I have objected to is the modern worship of science as an infallible source of truth, endowed with 'supernatural' powers over mortal men.&quot;<br />Early on, Bonewitz describes laws of magic, gleaned from multiple cultures and magical system. These include relatively obvious ideas, such as the Law of Knowledge (Knowledge is power &amp; Know thyself) and esoteric ones, like the Law of True Falsehoods (If it's a paradox, it's probably true). <br />He considers parapsychology, doing a useful job of considering some phenomena, and a more dubious job of trying to explain them. Nevertheless, this chapter does a coherent job of postulating why &quot;mainstream&quot; science does not verify parapsychological claims. <br />One of the most important chapters considers the difference between &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; magic. &quot;The whole idea of White as Good and Black as Evil is purely the result of cultural bigotries.&quot; (p. 95) While magic, as any other tool, can be ethical or unethical, ethics are not a matter of &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark.&quot; <br />His most practical chapter is the one entitled Fundamental Patterns of Ritual. &quot;The best spells and rituals are modern ones, written by yourself and designed to affect you personally, with your twentieth-century mind.&quot; (p. 162)<br />The book has a good, but dated bibliography. <br />What use is it? It's a good introduction to contemporary magical practice, as opposed to the &quot;Do this spell this way because the ancients (or some other authority) did it this way.&quot; Bonewitz explains why things might work and what type of an approach might be useful to adopt. It's good reading for the magic practitioner. It complements the various magical system books available (How to be a Witch in 13 Easy Lessons) as well as the more scholarly anthropological texts (such as Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane, which I have also reviewed). It's a laudatory attempt to move beyond the works of Aleister Crowley, Scott Cunningham, and Janet &amp; Stewart Farrar. <br />(If you've enjoyed this review, consider reading my other reviews here on Amazon.

US	52416483	R2XQS249XH2LR2	1567231209	704507104	Pornucopia	Books	4	206	209	N	N	Be it ever so humble, there's no penis like your own	I'm not certain a wilder fantasy can be had. An incubus/succubus, magical smegma, a set of detachable, interchangable penises of various sizes &amp; functions, demons, &amp; a woman scientist who doesn't know the meaning of the word &quot;No&quot; nor how a man values his own penis. This is Piers Anthony boldly rushing in where Mrs. Grundy fears to tread.<br />I enjoy his novels, and this one was no exception. I read it long before I had discovered Xanth, Tarot, or the Incarnations of Immortality. I don't think I had yet read the first Phaze trilogy. What an introduction! This book stood alone in it's own right--one doesn't have to be an Anthony fan to enjoy it.<br />I was attracted to the taboo-violating nature of the basic plot device: Evil scientist removes man's stubby little penis &amp; gives him a wide range of accessories (with full sensate functioning) to replace it. Man goes on quest to obtain techno-magical item to exchange for his original organ. The theme of &quot;a quest to obtain something magical so the wizard will return what is rightfully yours&quot; is a tired old theme. Applying it to a man's =PENIS= returns it to novelty!<br />Once you get past the creative audacity, this reads like any other Anthony novel. The characters don't have a lot of depth (the hero seems to occupy a fractal dimension larger than two but fails to achieve a full three dimensions). Who cares? His creativity is legendary--and this book showcases it well. Lots of challenges, action &amp; even the odd pun, all played out in a sci-fi-magico-phantasy-sexual arena.  <br />Yes, there are some very interesting forms of coupling portrayed in this book. I would hesitate to label it erotica, and certainly =NOT= consider it pornography. It's not a one-handed read. Think of it more as a Xanth novel you'd hate to explain to a pre-pubescent! This is as violent as any quest novel, but the sexual arena for the quest makes the violence less palatable.<br />Three stars for characterization. Four stars for plot. Five stars for shear audacity. If you've got an open &amp; adventurous mind, don't miss this unique book. <br />(If you liked this review, please read my other reviews at Amazon.com. Thanks, Elderbear)	2001-03-22
US	52416483	R1RAKCBIQ80VVV	0938317458	563296104	The Story of Colors / La Historia de los Colores: A Bilingual Folktale from the Jungles of Chiapas (English and Spanish Edition)	Books	5	18	20	N	Y	Make Rainbows, not War	Who was that masked man?<br />Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos has crafted a different kind of revolution and with it, a different revolutionary story.  This isn't another boring tome, that competes with the author's Kalishnakov repair manual for dreary tedium. In this book, targetted at children (and those who were once children), we read of colorful birds and quarrelling gods. More powerful fare than class warfare or guerrilla strategies. <br />The book begins with a walk up a hill in Chiapas. Well, actually, we read &quot;I light my pipe, and after three ceremonial puffs, I begin to tell you--just the way old Antonio used to tell it--&quot;<br />Already we are invited to a different world, a world where stories don't appear in living color between commercials, as a means of inducing consumption. If we accept this invitation, succeeding pages take us up a hill where &quot;el viejo Antonio&quot; takes time out from a journey to share a more colorful universe with the &quot;Insurgente.&quot; <br />The masked revolutionary turns back and sits down with the old one, who ignores his concern about reaching the village before the rain falls. Rain only endangers evil witches in Oz. Here in Chiapas, something more important bursts into our constructed reality, and we are transported to a world of black and white. No real colors. Only grey, to keep the black of night and the white of day from bumping into each other too hard. This is a world where the seven gods who created all things have disappeared. In this bleak landscape, only blind people and quarelsome, sleeply gods remain. <br />In the course of the story we learn many things. We hear the story of an unfamiliar culture. It's a fun story, playful, suitable for children. And it's a fable, a morality play about many practical things--looking where you're walking, not climbing too high, just about everything except running with a machete in your hands. <br />But, beneath these relatively harmless layers, lies more substantial material. The story evokes archetypes largely ignored by our plastic Ken &amp; Barbie culture. We seek comfort and security over nearly every other goal. La Historia de los Colores insinuates that breakthroughs come only when comfort is disrupted. The theme of the story, moving from a perspective of Black and White (with a little gray buffer zone) to Full Spectrum Color, well, many a doctoral dissertation could be written about the philosophical, psychological, sociological and political implications. But let's not engage in that level of intellectual masturbation. Read the book. Hear the story. Allow the brilliant illustrations to color your day. <br />Why are you still reading this review? El viejo Antonio isn't going to sit on that hilltop forever, catching his breath. The rainbow will fade and Insurgente Marcos will reach the village. Then the only colors you'll have will plaster the screen of your TV, encouraging you to buy something to make you forget that you just missed out on an epic spiritual experience masquerading as a children's book.<br />	2001-03-21
US	52416483	RISQOC5SLZIVF	0679723951	570915461	Memories, Dreams, Reflections	Books	5	288	300	N	N	The Myth of the Man, Look elsewhere for Biography	&quot;What we are to our inward vision, and what man appears to be sub specie aeternitatis, can only be expressed by way of myth. Myth is more individual and expresses life more precisely than does science... Thus it is that I have now undertaken, in my eighty-third year, to tell my personal myth. I can only make direct statements, only &quot;tell stories.&quot; Whether or not the stories are &quot;true&quot; is not the problem. The only question is whether what I tell is _my_ fable, _my_ truth.&quot; (C. G. Jung, p. 3)<br />If you're looking for a book &quot;about&quot; the life of Carl Jung, keep on looking. This is not so much a biography as it is a window into the process of Jung's experience. Think of this as Jung's &quot;case summary&quot; of his life. We don't read many of the amusing anectdotes, or &quot;objective&quot; critical insights that other biographies offer in abundance. Instead we get to experience Jung's auto-mythos for ourselves.<br />Jung reveals much, imparts wisdom, offers us early memories, and paints the canvas of his life for us. It's an incredible gift from a wise and self-reflective man. Jung was not without his faults, as other biographers have pointed out, he had many--some quite appalling! More than one of his analysands became his lover--behavior that would cost him his license today. But again, this is material you should look elsewhere for. Here he ponders his fears, his weaknesses, the ones that he has already accepted and worked with.<br />I recommend this book for people who have never read Jung before. It teaches more about his approach than any of his other books. It finds the meaning in his own life, viewed through his approach to life. &quot;Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore the equivalent to illness. Meaning makes a great many things endurable--perhaps everything.&quot; (p. 340)	2001-03-21

This book provides an experience of the Tao like few others. First, there is the blank page. Lots of white space. The absence, the void.<br />&quot;The Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled.&quot;<br />&quot;Profit comes from what is there, / Usefulness from what is not there.&quot;<br />Emptiness is the vessel which contains the words and images of this experience. Each chapter is written in both English and Chinese. I don't even pretend read Chinese, but the characters evoke a sense of something beyond ...<br />&quot;The form of the formless / the image of the imageless / it is called indefinable and beyond imagination.&quot;<br />The English translation reads smoothly. This is not the awkward prose frequently stumbled over when a scholar attempts to reproduce the ambiguities of the original in a foreign tongue. These words play smoothly together. The text does<br />&quot;not tinkle like jade / or clatter like stone chimes.&quot;<br />The final element in this alchemy is the photographs: <br />&quot;Less and less is done / until non-action is achieved. / When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.&quot;<br />Absent in this volume are the reams of footnotes which clutter most Taos I've read. Absent, too, are chapters on historical background and the relationship to Confucianism. If you seek these things, seek elsewhere.<br />For me, this book has opened a way to the Tao. <br />	2001-03-21

Although this was Gerald Gardner's first book on the Craft (published under the pen name Scire), most ritual presented within is ceremonial magic. At this time, much of modern Wicca had not yet been developed (The Charge of the Goddess had not yet taken its current form). Gleaning useful information from this text is a great deal of work--far more complete distillations may be found in the works of the authors named above.<br />Scire was not a great novelist, either. His prose is OK and his story development is adequate. But this isn't a real page turner. If you want to read occult fiction from this time period, *anything* Dion Fortune wrote is better written than this novel. Contemporary novels, such as Katherine Kurtz' Adept series &amp; Mercedes Lackey's Diana Tregarde tales seem much more palatable for anybody who just wants to entertain themselves with &quot;Witch Novels.&quot;<br />I am, however, deeply grateful for having taken the time and effort to read this book. It is a piece of History. Without Gerald B. Gardner and his antics, it is unlikely that the Craft would be available to the general public today. This book was the prodrome to the popular revival of the Craft. To read it is to partake of History. Because of this--not for its instructional merits, nor for its entertainment value--I give it five stars.	2001-03-20

It illuminates forgotten &amp; ignored experiences through rhythms and images of people who have made their lives' works out of committing the unconscious to the written page. These nuggets of truth find value as they elicit Truth from the reader's experience.<br />DON'T trace out your profile<br />forget your side view--<br />all that is outer sutff.<br />LOOK for your other half<br />who walks always next to you<br />and tends to be who you aren't.<br />-- Antonio Machado, translated by Bly, (p. 366)<br />It's difficult to flip at random through these pages, and not find an echo of something stirring deep, writhing in forgotten darkness. These words shine from the page to cast the shadow of that &quot;Other&quot; in sharp relief upon your mind. This is not a book of pretty verse, not poetry to read to grandma during the Christian Ladies Tea Party in the rose garden. These are words to sever the bondage to dysfunctional social programming: &quot;We have been busy accumulating solace / Make us afraid of how we were.&quot; (Rumi, p. 135)<br />Although the subtitle says &quot;Poems for Men,&quot; I'm certain women will find power &amp; freedom in these words, too. Some poems specifically name masculine woes, sorrows &amp; challenges. Where these do not apply directly to the lives of women, perhaps they will open a portal into men's souls for the other gender.<br />I've nearly worn mine out and will soon be getting another copy. If I only had one book of poetry to take to a desert island, this would be the one.	2001-03-20
US	52416483	RCBWQGQT8M4CS	0195142985	309344230	Black Misery (The Opie Library) (The Iona and Peter Opie Library of Children's Literature)	Books	5	18	18	N	N	A Book about Privilege for Adults and Children	Most white people rarely think about racial discrimination except as something that happened &quot;back then&quot; &quot;down south&quot;. We're (I write this as a white man) far more likely to whine about &quot;reverse discrimination,&quot; about how unfair affirmative action is and how confusing PC speech has become (Are &quot;they&quot; black, African-Americans, people of color or *what* ?). We tend to think of black people three ways:<br />1) We see them as white people with extra pigmentation. We don't really notice any difference and blithely assume that they're &quot;just like us&quot;.<br />2) We see them as gods and superheros, running faster, jumping higher, dancing better, and better endowed in various ways.<br />3) We demonize them--welfare mothers pumping out babies, gangstas, crack ho's &amp; that junkie pulling a smash 'n' grab to feed his habit. <br />Rarely do we ever try to understand what it's like, growing up different. Langston Hughes, in this powerful little book, opens a window for us. Although aimed at children of all races, perhaps the people who benefit most from this work will be white &quot;liberals&quot; who think racism is horrible until an African-American family moves in down the block.<br />&quot;Misery is when the taxi cab won't stop for your motoher and she says a bad word.&quot;<br />&quot;Misery is when you first realize so many things bad have black in them, like black cats, black arts, blackball.&quot;<br />&quot;Misery is when you go to the Department Store before Christmas and find out that Santa is a white man.&quot;<br />&quot;Misery is when you start to help an old white lady across the street and she thinks you're trying to snatch her purse.&quot;<br />These, and a whole host of others, are poignantly illustrated by Arouni. The book is introduced by Jesse Jackson, who points out that some things are dated (society has evolved a bit since 1967), but that plenty of room for progress remains. Historical events, such as the presidential election of 2000, demonstrate that deep and systematic racism still pervades American life. This was the last work that Langston Hughes wrote. He died in 1967, while working on the manuscript.<br />Both my 13-year-old son and my 8-year-old daughter have found the book touching. Reading it with them has helped them to have a better understanding of what it might be like to be &quot;different.&quot; I believe this book opens the way for genuine dialogue between people of different races, instead of maintaining projections and biases.	2001-03-20

But I was barely a teenager as that story broke. I was in my early 20's when I read Bitter Fruit, prior to meeting Stephen Schlesinger at a university function. <br />This is the story of how the United States Government plotted against and overthrew the first democratically elected government in Guatemala. It clearly demonstrates how our government became an instrument, not of Democracy, but of oppression for the benefit of the wealthy. The right-wing coup, planned and supported by the CIA, led to other covert operations, many of which succeeded in enriching American corporations at the expense of Democracy. <br />Jacobo Arbenz, elected to the presidency of Guatemala was faced with a crisis of poverty. Most of the nation's land belonged to a very few rich, and to United Fruit Company. Much of that land lay fallow. Arbenz instituted a land reform package which called for turning over fallow land to the country's impoverished campesinos. Land would be purchased by the government from the owners at the value THE OWNERS had declared for property tax purposes. Sounds fair enough, right? Honest landowners would receive fair recompense for unused land. Dishonest landowners would get their just desserts. <br />Nevertheless, United Fruit Company, using its pull with John Foster &amp; Allen Dulles, Secretary of State &amp; CIA Director, respectively, managed to have their own revolution created and funded by the US Government, wrapped in a shroud of anti-communism. The dictator they instated continued the tradition of repression that Guatemala had known for decades before. <br />The only real winners of in this story were the stockholders of United Fruit. Today, in the &quot;New World Order,&quot; we're more subtle, using international development loans and free trade agreements to undermine Democracy in third world nations. The tools may have changed, but the goal remains the same: Corporate wealth continues to supersede and destroy Democracy worldwide.	2001-03-20

Here you will encounter brief, theoretical discussions about how to solve common numerical problems, followed by implementations in C, and finished off with a few suggestions for further reading.<br />I've actually found the explanations about how to solve problems more useful than the code they provide. Their C coding style seems to harken back to FORTRAN days. I've also translated from C to MatLab and IDL in some instances (on one occasion, translating the MatLab routine back to C a few years later!)<br />Elsewhere on the net, mathematical critiques can be found. If you're trying to solve a critical problem, hunt these down. It bothered me to find vectors referenced from 1 to n as opposed to 0 to n-1, the way I'm used to seeing them in C code. <br />But, for practical use, this book is difficult to beat. It makes, at the very least, a great starting point, especially for those of us who last took a math class 18 years ago and find the details foggy. Kind of like The Joy of Cooking. A good, basic reference to keep around, but not the final word on gourmet programming.	2001-03-19

Unlike his signature work, A Time to Kill, the moral ambiguity inherent in these characters presents very little challenge to the reader. There is nobody to really like in the story. All the characters are more concerned with their own little scams and secrets--even when some of the scams have global proportions. <br />It's nice to read a book, to be amused by the antics of the characters, but not to be emotionally hooked in to anybody's wellbeing. I rarely find a book like that. It wasn't that I didn't care--I was very curious as to how things would resolve. But this book is really a story about people who have compromised themselves so badly that it's tough to really care whether they succeed at their plots (although I kinda wanted some of them to), or whether they get screwed. <br />The perfect book to sandwich between reading deep, emotionally provocative material, or to insulate one heavy tome on a ponderous subject from the next.<br />Fast. Lite. Fun.	2001-03-19

I never heard of anybody taking off on a motorcycle, even after graduation, for a journey like this. But Che Guevara was an exception to the rulers. The young (Everything he did was young--he didn't live to see 40.) Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, left the university &amp; his life of privilege for seven months on the road, touring South America, first on a motorcycle, then as a vagabond, with his compadre Alberto. <br />The two of them posed as Argentinian Doctors, specialists in the treatment of leprosy. This gained them food and lodging, as well as special treatment at times. It also gained them face-to-face experience with the impossible living conditions of people suffering from this disease.<br />Alberto &amp; Che traveled on their own resources. When money got tough, they scammed &amp; stowed-away, sometimes even working for a meal, but they didn't cable home for money or assistance. During this experience, Che became personally acquainted with the poverty and disempowerment prevalent in South America. <br />Reading the book was a delightful experience. Che has a poetic way with words. He doesn't take himself too seriously, telling tales of purloined wine, of scamming for sustenance, of bravely shooting a &quot;puma&quot; in the dark of night. By daylight it turned out to have been a local rancher's dog. He tells of hiding with a shipment of melons, hoping to stow away on a boat, but getting busted when sailors noticed melon rinds floating by the dock. Ernesto &amp; Alberto were indeed a couple of scallywags, but loveable, the kind you'd sit down with for a stein of beer or a cup of mate.<br />This book tells a human story, one that's unselfconscious enough to be truly enjoyable. Almost enough to make me want to sell the house, buy a motorcycle ...	2001-03-18

Each one stands alone and independent. The chapters span a wide range of subjects, from ecopsychology, to natural entheogens (teacher plants, which induce an altered state of consciousness useful for spiritual journeying).<br />He begins with an account of his visit with the Lacandones and experience of their Balche, an entheogenic drink. His next chapter uses depth psychology to analyze the Gaian hypothesis. He then describes a vision quest experience in the Mojave Desert before moving on to a discussion of the Veriditas of Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th century mystic. He examines the role of entheogens, then broaches the subject of the psychopathology of the human-nature relationship--also examining the dissociative split within human consciousness between the spiritual and the natural. He goes back in time to contrast the Indo-Kurgan &quot;sky gods&quot; with the matrifocal cultures and their earth deities. He peeks at the wild deities of animistic and shamanic cultures, and then considers how the reunification of the sacred and the natural could impact both individuals and society. He shows how our current situation demands that we move to an ecological world view. Finally, he concludes with a chapter which demands that we root ourselves in our bioregions, commenting that our identity is not simply the ego baggage we have acquired, but that we also identify as beings who exist in a place. Without the stories of our &quot;places,&quot; we are set adrift, and cannot forge a sacred union with the Natural.	2001-03-14

It is not a failure of government--it is true *self* government. This book gifts the reader with a photographic history of one of the grandest Anarchist experiments in modern times. <br />Powerful and inspiring pictures, chronicling what people can do when no longer subjected to a dominator paradigm government. A few pages of text give a brief, thumbnail history of the Spanish Civil War and the Anarcho-Syndicalist trades union, the CNT. Depressing to read about how industrialists, fascists, and communists worked together to destroy this movement of the people.<br />Nevertheless, the pictures . . . oh, the pictures speak tens of thousands of words. The &quot;mass man,&quot; so decried by philosophers like Jose Ortega y Gasset, rise up, take responsibility for and control of their own lives. Pictures of the workers organizing to run the factories, accountable to themselves. Pictures of society organizing itself, for itself. Truly, government of the people, for the people, by the people--not a system where the people's choice for representation is bought and sold by corporate interests!<br />[A final note]<br />What a great scam! Put out four songs on two micro CDs, then package them in a slick, 100 page picture book about the Spanish Civil War from an anarchist perspective. Not quite the fame and fortune of MTV, but better than trying to get down loaded off a website nobody's ever heard of. Because of the pictures, a scam I wholeheartedly support!	2001-03-14

Not the complacent, famous, academically lauded bourgeois wordsmiths, whose finely tuned logos tickles the ears of the privileged; but the harsh, dissonant, intrusive thoughts from the Shadow of society.<br />There is no poetry in privilege, not really, just resonant words with matching rhythms to lull the bourgeois into a sense of having actually experienced something. That excrement will not be found in these pages. Here are the words of queers &amp; niggers, the molested and the addicted, revolutionary martyrs and forgotten prisoners. Guaranteed to disturb you. They violate taboos and afflict the comfortable. <br />Some is political posturing. As much as I like Tuli Kupfberg's &quot;Paint it Black,&quot; it's nothing more than Anarchist filk. Doesn't make it good poetry--even though I appreciate Anarchism.<br />Luis J. Rodriguez's &quot;To the police officer who refused to sit in the same rom as my son because he's a 'gang banger',&quot; however prosaic it may be, has a rhythm all its own, its words elicit dark emotions, hard to finish reading without smoldering tears of unfaired against rage--no matter how white the reader.<br />Rudolfo Anaya's pocho poem, &quot;Walt Whitman Strides the Llano of New Mexico,&quot; opens a window into the experience of the disenculturated, of the moment of discovering a sense of value &amp; personhood. <br />Poem after poem demand to be read outloud, in a crowded mall or an elevator in a skyscraper. Each one will disrupt your day. Each one is powerful medicine, like Grandfather Peyote, causing a purge before enlightenment.	2001-03-14

Taken from interview transcripts by David Barsamian, this book reflects the Chomsky you may have heard on the radio or on a cassette. He presents information in a more casual manner than his &quot;written&quot; books. This book is a great introduction and a fast read (I knocked it off while waiting to see a doctor). <br />A great reference work for middle school kids writing social studies papers. Lots of facts, but not mind numbing scholarship to slog through. The book is well indexed, and contains a list organizations working to correct some of the problems he points out.<br />Chomsky continues to reiterate the thesis, which has made him famous, namely, that our democracy has been sold to the highest bidder. We do not live in a representative democracy, but rather a corporate oligarchy. While we go through the motions of free elections, in reality the choices have already been constrained to eliminate anybody who would reform the system.<br />In this short book (less than 100 pages of Chomsky), the first half is spent considering the failure of democracy in the United States. He then looks at the implications for the world, drawing some interesting conclusions. He notes that while the indigenous peasants of Chiapas (home of the Zapatistas) are nearly as oppressed as the chicanos living in East LA, the Angelenos are in much worse shape because of the destruction of Community. <br />Bottom line? It's a fast read. If you're predisposed to a progressive critique of politics and economics, it will support what you already believe. If not, you'll be annoyed and wish for footnotes so that you could refute him.	2001-03-14

If it's gotta be poetry, I like hard hitting modern verse. Epics ought to read like a novel--epics ought to be novels, and available on DVD! OK, so litigate--I'm a barbarian!<br />Heaney's Beowulf, however, was a pleasant departure. This provided my recreational reading for a few days. Although I've read that his translation isn't &quot;true&quot; to the Anglo-Saxon in some scholarly sense, I read the book for fun, not to analyze the formalisms of Anglo Saxon poetry.<br />What a change from last time I struggled through the material, 25 years ago! I'll grant myself a little intellectual maturity, but most of the credit goes to Heaney for making this powerful story accessible and entertaining. No, it still doesn't read like a Clancy or Grisham novel--but when one of them runs out of story lines . . .<br />In one sense this is a sacred text. The language differs enough from contemporary use to shift the way I mentally processed it. Just the act of reading the poetic story took me beyond the boundaries of profane life and into the mythological realm. Archetypes lept into the story, the Grendels (and their mothers) of my mind slunk into consciousness for a while. Because the language does not lend itself to simply sliding into a novel, it can enable a deeper experience of the myth.<br />An added pleasure was the inclusion of the Anglo Saxon verse itself. I don't read it. But I loved the sound. It is the sound of my ancestors. My wife didn't appreciate it, when I'd inflict it upon her as she was dozing off to sleep. This book is worth purchasing, just for the opportunity to read a page of the old words, just for the opportunity to hear the language of ancestors bouncing around the room.	2001-03-14

I've test-hiked 7 or 8 of Jerry's hikes. His descriptions and directions are quite accurate. Now I've only got 90-something left to go!<br />I grew up in SoCal, and found it easy to get into a rut, always hiking in the same places, only during the summer. This book provides interesting hikes in the coastal foothills for the spring and autumn, hikes in the desert for the winter, and mountain hikes for the summer. <br />His descriptions of the hikes allow the reader to match their adventure to their level of physical fitness. He includes enough information to determine how much water should be carried and even whether to bring the point-n-shoot camera or the 35mm SLR with a macro lens for wildflowers.<br />Whether you're new to the area and want a few good hikes, or a long-time native looking to break out of a rut, this book is for you.

Richard Niebuhr writes as a Christian, but this work has meaning beyond the scope of the Christian faith. Here, he analyzes how the sacred can relate to the profane, the spiritual to the mundane.<br />After defining &quot;Christ&quot; (Mediator, involving double movement, from God toward man &amp; from men toward God) and &quot;Culture&quot; (the artificial, secondary environment that man imposes on the natural), he dedicates a chapter to each of the five ways he sees the sacred &amp; profane relating.<br />The first of these, &quot;Christ against Culture,&quot; focuses on the opposition of the sacred to the profane. He examines the ekklesia, or &quot;calling out&quot; inherent in the sacred (that which is set apart, beyond the horizon). He critiques this approach by showing how ultimately it leads to an otherworldly Christianity which can have minimal, if any impact on the world.<br />Opposed to this is &quot;The Christ of Culture.&quot; From this viewpoint, the sacred is discovered in culture. That which is most Christlike in culture is celebrated, the spiritual teachings which bring man into community, which find meaning in the &quot;ordinary&quot; take precedence. The danger of this approach, is that belief will merge with society, and the sacred will be, eventually, completely lost.<br />Adherents to the &quot;Christ above Culture&quot; motif compartmentalize the sacred and the profane. Christ is for church and bed-time prayers, culture is the realm of business. At best, spiritually informed morals guide behavior in culture. By compartmentalizing the sacred as separate from the profane, this approach de-vitalizes the profane and disempowers the sacred.<br />The &quot;Christ in Paradox with Culture&quot; approach sees man as sinful and grounded in culture. Man cannot escape the profane--this is part of his nature. Christ, on the other hand, calls man into the sacred. This is the paradox--called to the sacred, a part of the profane. The only resolution is seen as God's redeeming grace.<br />His final approach considers &quot;Christ the Transformer of Culture.&quot; He presents the permeation of all life by the immanent presence of divinity. This lays a geis upon the believer to manifest the Divine within culture, leading to both spiritual and practical, political and social action.<br />He concludes by stating that we must make our decisions in faith, that not one of these five approaches can lay claim to being the &quot;One True&quot; Christian approach.<br />I find it interesting that he takes nearly an entire book to develop the &quot;Christ the Transformer of Culture&quot; idea. This is one which more modern Christian theologians (ie Matthew Fox) develop rapidly as a basis for further discussion. Starhawk, the noted author of Goddess thealogy, starts by assuming an immanent Divine presence, both sanctifying all of the &quot;profane&quot; and demanding that situations of injustice be confronted.en as God's redeeming grace.<br />His final approach considers &quot;Christ the Transformer of Culture.&quot; He presents the permeation of all life by the immanent presence of divinity.

This is a great source for a retelling of the old Norse myths. Rather than merely translating, Holland decided to bring together all sources and &quot;to retell the myths in new versions, and hope that they are both representative of the originals and full-blooded in their own right.&quot; I believe that he succeeded at the second task. I'm not enough of a scholar or time-traveller to judge his success at representing their original versions.<br />This book serves as an excellent introduction to Norse mythology. Most of the major stories are present. Holland retells the stories in the first part of the book, then provides insight into sources and other interpretations for each story in the back. His index, bibliography, and glossary are quite useful.<br />The myths are quite readable, suitable even for bedtime reading for older children. This book would make a great resource for a middle- or a high-school report. For those contemplating college level work, get direct translations of the Eddas and of Saxo Grammaticus. Even for college level work, Holland can serve as a roadmap to the primary sources.<br />Where Holland fails (and he fails miserably), is his failure to unwrap the Vanic from the Aesic traditions in the myths. Metzner has shown in The Well of Remembrance: Rediscovering the Earth Wisdom Myths of Northern Europe that the uncritical blending of these two traditions gives a different character to Norse mythology. In spite of this failing, however, Holland's book serves as a good introduction to the subject and primes the reader for more research, either directly into the Eddas, or for the work of Metzner and of H. Ellis Davidson.	2001-03-14

I got brain-lock, and couldn't even use them effectively in a package like Matlab or IDL. I got lost in integrals and delta functions and found myself rapidly sinking into mathematical quicksand. Evoking qliphotic demons from within a pentagram of power would have been simpler and less arcane.<br />Then along came Brigham. Although his book had all the gnarly math of any other Fourier transform explanation I had ever seen, he also drew diagrams--diagrams which allowed me to &quot;get&quot; what the language of mathematics had so clearly expressed. All of a sudden the integrals were tamed. I wasn't in quicksand, just a damp sidewalk at Adventureland, waiting for the Jungle Cruise. <br />And that was just the first couple of chapters! Brigham quickly moved into transform theory, applying the Fourier integral to convolution and correlation. Then into sampled waveforms and the discrete Fourier transform and its applications. <br />Finally, he presented the Fast Fourier Transform. Once again, he clarifies without obfuscating. I found the FFT moving from the hyper-arcane to the land of &quot;Well, duh!&quot; (Beware: The actual FFT code included is not particularly efficient. Find source code for implementation *elsewhere*.) He extends the FFT to convolution and correlation, as well as to two dimensions. He doesn't skimp on applications, either. He clarifies interferometry, time-difference-of-arrival, power spectrum analysis, and beamforming. <br />If you're not a signal processing wonk already, read this book. You may find it a powerful cure for DSP-phobia.	2001-03-13

I discovered that I &quot;thought&quot; in C already. The language packaged the constructs which I had been translating into FORTRAN at work.<br />I already knew Pascal, FORTRAN, BASIC, and assembler, so I wasn't a virgin programmer.

Working the exercises in this book not only taught me the C language, but it also tightened up my programming style.<br />The book begins in a non-threatening manner, and walks the reader through the basics of software creation in C. From the simple, classic &quot;hello world&quot; program to useful utilities, this book makes software creation seem easy. It teaches not only the C language, but also the discipline of writing quality code.	2001-03-13

It's been 20 years since I first read Hick's book. Looking back, that experience proved to be a definitive turning point in my life. <br />John Hick presents two philosophies which Christians have used to explain the existence of evil in a universe created by a &quot;good&quot; God. The first philosophy states that God's plan is ineffable--we ought to have faith &amp; not question. What we see as evil, with our limited, mortal vision, is just one feature of God's marvelous plan for the cosmos. <br />The second philosophy seeks to find reason in the occurrence of evil. Hick echos Ortega y Gasset's philosophy that growth does not happen in comfort, but rather when challenged. Hick adopts this second philosophy, tracing it back to Origen. <br />Since growth, or soul building, is the purpose of life, Hick argues that God must ensure that everybody achieves the growth necessary for &quot;paradise.&quot; This leads to espousing reincarnation, where the soul continues to evolve, until maturity.	2001-03-13

The book gives an excellent feel for the life of an Ibo tribesman in the Nigerian bush. The reader learns of customs and taboos; how families relate and power is wielded; and how society deals with taboo violations. The impact of British Colonial rule also makes an appearance in this tale--leading to a conclusion which gasps with intensity. <br />But if this were all the book had to recommend it, one could easily ignore it as a mere window into the bygone lifestyle of a culture most of us can safely pay no attention to. Few of us will ever travel to occupied Biafra to eat yams and see the colorful clothing. The closest most of us will ever come to this environment is the Nigerian taxi driver who whisks us to the airport or hotel.<br />Okonkwo begins his life in shame. His father fails to provide well for the family. For the rest of his life, Okonkwo sets out to demonstrate to the world that he can do better. He works tirelessly, he accumulates degrees and initiation. He affords wives and children. <br />But, he finds little pleasure in this life. Angry, violent, he distances himself from the family who might have succored him. Still, driven by shame, he keeps working hard, trying to show the world that he is a force to be reckoned with. More yams! More wealth! Lead the village to battle! Stand firm &amp; strong.<br />Although his compatriots admire him, he fails to connect with them. Rather than allowing friendships to deepen, to find support and connection, Okonkwo continues to achieve, to compete, trying to surpass those who would have loved to be his allies.<br />This isolation, born out shame, leads to Okonkwo's demise. Achievement never leads to the community, to the connections and sharing, which allows shame to heal. Okonkwo was never able to feel a part of his community, and it cost him his life.<br />Isolation and shame are rampant in twentieth century western culture. The message we experience repeatedlytells us that our achievement will lead us to power and to happiness. The reality, as disclosed in Okonkwo's story, is that achievement does not create connection. Only the willingness to be vulnerable, to let another see into one's private spaces, will build the community and connection which can heal shame.	2001-03-11

The price they have paid in order to become modern deprives them of the underlying phenomena which have always empowered spiritual experience as a meaningful force in the past.<br />The chief point of the book is &quot;to show in what ways religious man attempts to remain as long as possible in a sacred universe, and hence what his total experience of life proves to be in comparison with the experience of the man without religious feeling, of the man who lives, or wishes to live, in a desacralized world.&quot;<br />Eliade begins with hierophany, the event of the sacred manifesting itself to us, the experience of a different order of reality entering human experience. He presents the idea of sacred space, describing how the only &quot;real&quot; space is sacred, surrounded by a formless expanse. Sacred space becomes the point of reference for all other spaces. He finds that people inhabit a midland, between the outer chaos and the inner sacred, which is renewed by sacred ritual and practice. By consecrating a place in the profane world, cosmogony is recapitulated and the sacred made accessible. This becomes the center of the primitive world. Ritual takes place in this sacred space, and becomes a way of participating in the sacred cosmos while reinvigorating the profane world. <br />Next, Eliade considers sacred time and mythology. While &quot;profane time&quot; is linear, sacred time returns to the beginning, when things were more &quot;real&quot; than they are now. Again, ritual plays an important part. Time is regenerated by being created anew as rituals tie participants back to the sacred origins of the cosmos. Thus, the cycle of the year becomes a paradigm for community renewal and for replentishing the world from the sacred genesis. <br />He goes on to examine how a number of the elements of nature typically play into sacred experience. He considers water, the sacred tree, the home and the body. He notes that &quot;No modern man, however irreligious, is entirely insensible to the charms of nature.&quot; Cosmic symbolism adds a new value to an object or action without removing the inherent values. Religious man finds within himself the same sanctity which he finds in the cosmos. &quot;Openness to the world enables religious man to know himself in knowing the world--and this knowledge is precious to him because it is religious, because it pertains to being.&quot; <br />He concludes the book by considering the contrast between homo religiosus and profane man. Non-religious man finds that all things have been desacralized. This can be liberating, in that oppressive meanings have been removed--but also impoverishing as all actions and items have been deprived of spiritual significance. He speaks to the great loss of Christianity:<br />&quot;The religious sense of the urban population is gravely impoverished. The cosmic liturgy, the mystery of nature's participation in the Christological drama, have become inaccessible to Christians living in a modern city. Their religious experience is no longer open to the cosmos. In the last analysis, it is a strictly private experience; salvation is a problem that concerns man and his god [sic]; at most, man recognizes that he is responsible not only to God but also to history. But in these man-God-history relationships there is no place for the cosmos. From this it would appear that, even for a genuine Christian, the world is no longer felt as the work of God.<br />This is a powerful book. It presents basic elements of religious experience, and allows the reader to notice where their lack can be felt in modern society and his own life. Eliade suggests no solutionsto the problems which this consideration may raise. If one is inclined towards the Christian tradition, Matthew Fox's writings, particularly ORIGINAL BLESSING, may offer hope. For others, more exploration is required.	2001-03-11

The United States imprisons more people, *and* more people per capita, than any other nation in the world! Leonard's poignant book gives the reader a feel for *one* story of life behind bars. Not a journal or a story, per se, but a series of reflections, of meditations, of poems about life as a prisoner, life as a *political* prisoner in the Land of the Free.<br />You, who read this, with access to a personal computer, cannot begin to wrap your life around the experience of being caged. Of having every aspect of your life regulated. You, who grew up white, privileged, cannot wrap your mind around the experience of being beaten up simply because you spoke your native language. You, who grew up on land you &quot;owned,&quot; have insulated yourself from imagining the pain of having your people destroyed, your culture outlawed, and your identity trampled into the mud.<br />So don't buy this book. Your will be able to continue your life comfortably. You'll be able to proceed with that warm fuzzy feeling that things are OK with the world, and that even if agent Fox Mulder has died, the FBI is really on *your* side. <br />Don't buy this book. You don't want to begin to feel what Leonard feels, caged in Leavenworth. Don't buy this book, it's easier to pretend that *those* people deserve to be locked up, that *those* people are animals, that the *justice* system really works most of the time. Don't buy this book, you don't want to have any inkling about what it feels like when justice miscarries.<br />Leonard Peltier wasn't (Mark) Rich enough for a Clinton pardon. He has exhausted his legal appeals. Prison Writings tells you what he will probably experience until he dies in Leavenworth. Since he's been sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus seven years, he wonders, will they keep his body in jail after he dies to get that second term?<br />Enough polemics. The book briefly recounts Leonard's history, the story of the shooting at Pine Ridge, and his trial. It intersperses his poetry with stories. His anger comes across loud and clear. There's a chapter about the massacre at Wounded Knee. I can't read that chapter without the tears rolling down my face. 300 women and children, surrounded by U. S. Cavalry, mowed down with cannon fire &amp; gatling guns. 20 Congressional Medals of Honor were awarded for this atrocity. <br />Leonard doesn't pull any punches. He conveys, quite effectively, that we live in a land where systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing have nearly destroyed the indigenous people and enabled *us* to benefit greatly. While we look down our noses at the Nazi holocaust, we ignore the American holocaust. I wonder, is it any more *wrong* to lather your body with Jew soap, or to build your home on land soaked with the blood of the people who came before you?<br />Much easier to point our fingers at the Nazis and to smugly feel that we'd never participate in anything so horrible. <br />If you're looking for a book with more details about the Pine Ridge shootings and AIM, Peter Matthiessen's In the Spirit of Crazy Horse is a great source. The video, Incident at Oglala, provides an extremely biased presentation of Leonard's story....	2001-03-10

Using both theory and concrete examples, it lays out how therapists can help their clients re-vision and consciously edit the meanings they experience in their &quot;scripts&quot; of life. Doan and Parry present techniques which can be used with individuals as well as families or groups. Many of their techniques can be used effectively with other styles of therapy. <br />The approach to therapy, presented in this book, empowers the client to consider her/his life story, to notice where others have scripted how they live and how they view their experiences. It provides tools to help clarify where these contstructs are helpful and where the client would like to create his/her new constructs to replace those which no longer serve. <br />Doan &amp; Parry also encourage clients to &quot;give back,&quot; to share their experiences with other clients, helping to not only solidify progress, but to encourage those who have not yet made much progress in therapy.	2001-03-10

While the book strings together anectdotes and sophmoric platitudes, it fails to provide real substance. If you want a light, schmaltzy read that makes you have warm fuzzy feelings about Mr. Bush, then go ahead. This is the book for you. <br />Realize that this book only promotes the facade. The man in this book is not the same man who is already asking Congress to condone assasination and to ignore the Constitution by giving Federal funding to selected religious groups. The man in this book is one who claims to &quot;Trust the People&quot;. The man in the White House is one who did everything he could to prevent Florida from ever completing a single, complete count of the ballots.<br />If you want to read a well written, well researched, book by a presidential candidate, read Al Gore's EARTH IN BALANCE. While Gore failed to live up to the ideals which he expounded in that book, and while you may oppose his ideas, at least that book was well written and contained substantial subject matter.	2001-01-28

Ralph Metzner examines Norse mythology through a very matricentric set of lenses, deconstructing some of the dominance-model material that has found its way  into Norse &quot;tradition&quot;. He reclaims the Vanic tradition without  dishonoring the Aesir. He focuses on the shamanic aspects of Odin and  deconstructs a great deal of misogynistic material surrounding Freyja. He  separates the Norse heritage from the Nazi mythos and gives us a humane and  empowering way to reclaim the Nordic traditions. This is a unique book--one  I cannot recommend loudly enough.	2000-02-08
