He's been lampooned by comic strips like \\"The Boondocks,\\" and comedians like the pre-CNBC Dennis Miller, and marginalized even by his former Republican Party. But Buchanan strikes a voice of conservatism reaching past both Bush administrations to heroes like Senators Robert \\"Mr. Conservative\\" Taft,  Barry \\"Courage of a Conservative\\" Goldwater, and former President Ronald Reagan, to whom this book is dedicated.<br /><br />That view dominates \\"Where The Right Went Wrong,\\" a robust look at what Buchanan sees as a betrayal of conservative ideals. Buchanan uses history and even well-chosen poetic quotes to sketch what he sees as kidnapping of traditional conservatism, by \\"a cabal that betrayed the good cause of conservatism, because, from the very beginning, they never believed in it. They had another agenda all along.\\" Moving from the war on terror to Operation Iraqi Freedom, from the US's dicey economic relationship with China to free trade and its effect on American manufacturing, Buchanan maps that agenda, names those behind it, and documents statistically where their decisions left us.<br /><br /> He names columnists like Charles Krauthammer and Jonah Goldberg and publications like the Weekly Standard (all of which vilified Buchanan). Most importantly, he indicted \\"The Vulcans,\\" President George W. Bush's foreign policy team (including Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, and Richard Pearle) for introducing the new President to a US military role as world policeman closer to Woodrow Wilson's desire to \\"make the world safe for democracy.\\" Buchanan see this as rationale behind the war in Iraq and the current North Korean nuclear crisis, among other examples of US military might spread thin. (To be fair, Buchanan near the end of the book praises the current President Bush as a \\"God-fearing man\\" who returned decency to the office after the Clinton years.)<br /><br />Buchanan skillfully uses history to make his points, producing nimble histories of Islam's cultural battle with the West, China's edgy relationship with the US over Taiwan, terrorism's strategic permanence as a weapon in revolution reaching to the Civil War and Russian czars. Buchanan carefully explains terrorism without legitimizing it. He chillingly mentions some of its practitioners, from Mao-Tse Tung (to whom Buchanan wrote the toast President Nixon used when visiting China in 1972) and Michael Collins to Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon, are heroes to their homelands. Buchanan condemns 9-11 as the horror it was but quickly to add, \\"They were here because we were there (in their homeland)\\"<br /><br />Some of this comes across as petulant, especially when Buchanan mentions being skewered in the same \\"National Review\\" magazine he once contributed to. But agree with Buchanan or not (and thanks to hanging chads in 2000, it's hard to know how many do), \\"Where The Right Went Wrong\\" eloquently asks the right questions about America's economic, legislative and moral future. Buchanan outlines a plan for change countercurrent to any existing party line, which makes his book a welcome level-set of conservative thought and an fresh take on world events in historical context.

A generation now calling him \\"John Paul The Great\\" is only beginning to scratch the depth of his 27-year reign, beginning with the opening words of his papacy, \\"Be not afraid!\\"<br /><br />One of this century's most traveled, prolific and media-savvy leaders, the Holy Father left a legacy including encyclicals, devotionals and even a best-selling album. Among these writings, a handful can be at first looked at to help understand how John Paul II saw his faith, his Church, his part in history and ultimate role as \\"servant of the servants of God.\\"<br /><br />\\"Crossing the Threshold of Hope\\" would be fascinating for its history alone. Originally conceived as a worldwide TV interview featuring journalist Vittorio Messori, Pope John Paul II is consistently asked the time (his views on eternal life, on the Church's role in ending Communism, his personal role in the Second Vatican Council, the Church's consistent moral stances in a changing world). He then explains how to build the watch with succinct, near poetic answers to religious, philosophical, and historical questions.<br /><br />The Pontiff's answers draw on youth, family and friends in his beloved native Poland, including the horror of World War II's concentration camps. This fueled his commitment to human life and, upon becoming Pope, his outreach to the Jewish people he called, \\"our elder brothers in faith.\\" He draws on philosophic giants from St. Thomas Aquinas to Immanuel Kant to Rene Descartes, skillfully placing Descartes' rationalism at the start of rebellion against Christianity and the Church and others on their respective timelines.<br /><br />His answers respects yet clearly distinguishes Catholicism from other monotheistic faiths (even praising Islam's \\"fidelity to prayer.\\") The Pope's commitment to the Gospel and Catholic tradition (including his love for Christ's mother) balanced with outreach to other faiths, underlined Christ's prayer for Christian unity which became the Holy Father's mission.<br /><br />The book is brief (230 pages in hardback), chapters but a few pages and reader-friendly despite many sacred and philosophical references (including his favorite poet, Cyprian Norwid). Overall, this inspiring book is must reading for any person of faith. It helps its reader understand why Pope John Paul II was not only who Rev.

He opens in 1930 at the rise of the Great Depression, with veterans across from the White House coldly shunned by President Herbert Hoover when asking for advance relief from the Great Depression, then brutally attacked by troops and national guardsmen led by Douglas MacArthur. He concludes with President Richard Nixon's second inaugural in 1973 at Watergate's rising, Vietnam demonstrators audible blocks away amidst calls for national unity and self-reliance.<br /><br />In between, across 1300 pages, (excluding index and exhaustive bibliography) \\"The Glory and the Dream\\" chronicles the American Century's meatiest, most eventful years (1932-72). Manchester details a diary for and about what he called the \\"swing generation\\" but whom ex-NBC-TV anchorman Tom Brokaw (who cited Manchester as an influence) christened \\"the Greatest Generation.\\"<br /><br />These men and women endured and thrived through what, against Manchester's narrative, seemed (except for the relatively tranquil late 1950s) a non-stop whirlwind of hardship. Painting in broad strokes by economic numbers Manchester reveals compelling pictures of the Depression, bank and crop failures, Franklin Roosevelt's election and the New Deal, World War II, and the Korean and Cold Wars. He also includes near month by month chronicles and analysis on America's roots and involvement in the Vietnam War and Watergate, which takes up most of the book's final third. And of course, he addresses the still-shocking days of rage, murder, and decaying social fabric in the late 1960s.<br /><br />Manchester's storytelling is expertly paced, foreshadowing careers of 20th century icons like Nixon, JFK, Marilyn Monroe and even the Edsel. He traces their steps to the national stage and devotes personal \\"Portrait of An American\\" sections to many (including Dr. Benjamin Spock, Edward R Murrow, and Ralph Nader). He does this deftly balancing international, social, and economic views of day to day life, worked, and socialized, even addressing political and social extremists (50s beatniks, 60s hippies, John Birchers). Isolationist vs. internationalist foreign policy views, themes as recent as last month's Iraq election, pops up throughout the book; virulent opposition to FDR's war mobilization leads to the opposition to the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan. Vietnam's civil war slowly creeps  across several administrations beginning with Dwight Eisenhower's, reaching the heart of American experience as the decade and book close.<br /><br />Anyone knowing or having lived through part of the last half-century can reference America's seismic events at a high level. To Manchester's credit he reached deeper into the causes behind pop culture and historical touchstones like Nixon's \\"Checkers\\" speech, 1968's Vietnam My Lai massacre, the oft-overlooked 1936 hurricane crushing New England (and ineffective warnings against it), and Japan's 1937 sinking of the USS Panay which foreshadowed Pearl Harbor. He draws dimensional character studies amidst the era's scandals (the fall of Eisenhower right hand man Sherman Adams as one example). He allows you to understand personalities and issues behind history's strongest feuds: President Harry Truman against union leader John Lewis (or MacArthur, or Joseph McCarthy...), between Southern governors and other leadership against Dr. Martin Luther King, the Freedom Riders, the Kennedy administration, and finally against the Black Panthers' vicious 1960s anarchy. Finally, he chronicles the \\"silent majority\\" generation gap between Nixon/Agnew's divisive, reactionary leadership team and a generation's angry youth.<br /><br />Before his death last year, Manchester wrote whole volumes on major figures included here (Winston Churchill, MacArthur, JFK). But given the relatively short time each is presented (except for FDR, who dominates the book's first half ), Manchester masterfully retells individual personal style, social time, major accomplishments, blunders, and closure to their lives and histories. \\"The Glory and the Dream\\" is filled with protests after violent counter protests (which Manchester respects even when he does not agree), well-drawn, memorable characters more remarkable for being real life characters, and insightful side comments on issues like the role of the vice-presidency and American tolerance of dissent.<br /><br />At its publication, Manchester himself called \\"The Glory and the Dream\\" the culmination of his career, and for once it was not hyperbole. Anyone wishing to understand American character must start here; \\"The Glory and the Dream\\" is the finest history-based book I've ever read, and one of the finest in any genre.<br /><br />Absolutely essential.hester masterfully retells individual personal style, social time, major accomplishments, blunders, and closure to their lives and histories. \\"The Glory and the Dream\\" is filled with protests after violent counter protests (which Manchester respects even when he does not agree), well-drawn, memorable characters more remarkable for being real life characters, and insightful side comments on issues like the role of the vice-presidency and American tolerance of dissent.  <br /> <br />At its publication, Manchester himself called \\"The Glory and the Dream\\" the culmination of his career, and for once it was not hyperbole.

Buckley Jr. acknowledges being described as an evangelist for conservative political and economic ideals. This world view, fueled by efforts to bring faith-based, like-minded people to the polls, helped George W. Bush's 2004 re-election.<br /><br />In \\"Nearer, My God,\\" written before President Bush took office (and whose title springs from the hymn,\\"Nearer My God To Thee\\") Mr. Buckley draws from Catholic liturgy, philosophy, dialogue, art and debate (reaching to Scripture itself) to describe and affirm his love for Christ and his Catholic faith.<br /><br />The book is subtitled, \\"An Autobiography of Faith,\\" and often reads with warm, vivid, humorous family memories and familial wit (a WFB trademark.) Mr. Buckley vividly describes his youth in strict but nurturing St. John's school in Beaumont, and recalls his parents and siblings' religious practice (closing  with tender remembrances of his mother Aloise, to whom he dedicated the book). Mr. Buckley tempers memories of a nephew's ordination into a strict Benedictine order, a Sistine Chapel TV taping and audience with Pope John Paul II with humorous asides on bad wine, camcorder angles and papal misintroductions. Mr. Buckley also bemusedly describes his years at Yale, from where gradual, hard-hearted removal of Christian symbolism and ethos inspired his first best seller and a recurring theme in this book. (WFB's dismantles Millbrook College's Christmas, um, \\"Candlelight\\" service with particular humor and relish.)<br /><br />But WFB also at times falls into the moderator role he often took on his flagship PBS show, \\"Firing Line.\\" Early in \\"Nearer My God\\" he steps back and relays a blow-by-blow theological debate between author Arnold Lunn and Catholic priest Ronald Knox in their book \\"Difficulties.\\" Lunn and Knox touch on everything from the Crusades and Inquisition to the concept of pre-destination and eternal damnation. The episode concludes ends with Lunn converting and Knox performing the ceremony.<br /><br />Mr. Buckley later gathers recent Catholic converts (including former National Review colleague Jeffrey Hart) to ask their personal conversion stories (their \\"road to Damascus,\\" as WFB calls it) and views on issues like married priesthood, contraception, and Christ's uniqueness to His time. But Lunn and Knox, and Mr. Buckley's panel, slowly reach the same conclusion: trust God's providence and authority given His church and shepherd to interpret the faith. To help, Mr. Buckley invokes Bishop Joseph Butler's \\"escape,\\" which states if you would have created the world, you would have done so differently. (WFB effectively invokes the \\"escape\\" here describing an Turkish earthquake and more recently in National Review after Hurricane Charley struck Florida.)<br /><br />For its many strengths, \\"Nearer, My God\\" is not a Catholic conversion tool. Mr. Buckley takes issue with Latin's gradual disappearance from Mass and other Vatican II-era changes, describes a wayward Protestant evangelist (who later repented) as a \\"cretin\\" while praising equally rehabilitated Watergate-era figure Charles Colson. You also leave the book wanting to understand, as best he can explain it, more of WFB's personal relationship with Jesus Christ.<br /><br />But as WFB unwinds wisdom from sources as diverse as John Henry Newman, Andrew Greeley, and even Bach's \\"St. John's Passion,\\" no one will finish this book without understanding Catholicism's permanence and reason to resist popular sentiment.  It's what held its faithful followers to it even now, if not always to its highest teachings. (Mr. Buckley devotes part of the book to sin's concept and role in social morality). \\"Nearer My God,\\" is an often moving semi-autobiography, written expertly by one of the 20th century's most influential thinkers and seekers of knowledge.

But \\"Brinkley's Beat,\\" published shortly after its author's death in June 2003, retains the trademark of his six-decade news career: a walk along the fine line between wry humor and casual, near folksy storytelling, all told with an insider's sense of detail.<br /><br />It's basically Brinkley clearing out his lengthy, valuable notebook, remembering people he knew and sharing a few pages at a time about them. In chapters no more than a few pages each he recalls infamous icons like Senator Joe McCarthy (with some personal remembrances of Brinkey's sister, who worked for McCarthy), FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover, and Teamsters Union boss Jimmy Hoffa. He also shares his views on presidents from Clinton to John Kennedy. Brinkley candidly assesses each man's career and their enduring popularity and legacy.<br /><br />Along the way he speaks of personal disdain over Johnson's allegedly wiretapping his phone during the Vietnam war, shares a moving account of the days following Robert Kennedy's 1968 assassination, and even chastises himself for publically criticizing Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election victory speech. (It would be Brinkley's final covered campaign even as another chapter addresses the 24 political conventions he reported at and how television changed the conventions' intent and approach.)<br /><br />But \\"Brinkley's Beat\\" shares its spotlight with smaller, more intimate reminiscences. He writes brief histories of a rogue's gallery of forgotten political figures including bigoted Washington mayor Theodore Bilbo, Roosevelt-era reporter May Craig and long-winded Senator Everett \\"Wizard of Ooze\\" Dirksen, describing their foibles with touches of quaint sentiment mixed in with the deserved ridicule.<br /><br />Brinkey extends his personality studies to places he visited during a series of travelogues he hosted in the 1960s. He writes of Vienna trying to reclaim a  past of classical music and rich food, and of Florida beaches and hotels beginning their decades-long, pre-Disney reputation as tacky playgrounds. Brinkley also shares a personal portrait of Normandy at D-day in 1944 and at its 50th anniversary, keeping his wry humor while praising those who fought there and citing the horrid conditions they endured.<br /><br />Many see NBC's Tom Brokaw and, soon, CBS's Dan Rather leaving their long-held anchormen's chairs as the end of an era in news coverage. To that end, Brinkley's final reflections are his most valuable as he says, \\"The news becomes not just what happened but what a familiar face and voice says happened, and the meaning of it is to some extent determined by how he says it.\\" David Brinkley's unique approach to the news, from his cadence  to the angles he reported it from to the rapport and credibility he gained presenting it, endeared him to two generations and made him an icon the near equal of those he covered. While \\"Brinkley's Beat's\\" tone is a bit cranky, it's still a breezy, worthwhile read for history and journalism buffs.

The working relationship between America's 33rd and 34th presidents, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, wasn't quite a first-name buddy relationship or one between close comrades (although they collaborated on the Marshall Plan and key initiatives of the first Cold War years.) But assembling formal documents, letters, speeches, telegrams, and even early TV appearances, Neal accurately if dryly (few personal interviews) charts 15 years' key dialogue between two of America's revered post-war figures.<br /><br />Neal successfully shows how key events of 1945-60 (culminating in JFK's election) serve to unite, than divide the men. Truman admires Eisenhower's early work helping rebuild Germany's economy, while Eisenhower supports formation of NATO and SHAPE, (buttress against post-war Communist aggression.) Both agree on early attempts to mitigate Soviet and Chinese threats, leading to histories of 1950-53's Korean war and Douglas MacArthur's controversial dismissal (with both men agreeing on their dim view of the revered military figure).<br /><br />Neal also makes the case for Senators Joe McCarthy and William Jenner's divisive Senate tenures changing Truman and Eisenhower's relationship, in Neal's words, \\"from one of bitter words into one of mutual contempt.\\" Eisenhower enters 1952's campaign election after years' reluctance as a stand against US isolationism, only finding himself supporting unpopular senators along party lines and not fully supporting Truman cabinet members (such as Gen. George Marshall) against McCarthy's attacks. But Neal also shows Truman's political expediency as he first dismisses the younger John Kennedy in 1960 before endorsing his candidacy more enthusiastically than Eisenhower did his vice president, Richard Nixon.<br /><br />You sense the awe in which Neal holds both men, honoring their respective contributions to society. He spends Chapter 29's first paragraphs explaining how each administration's agendas (for national security, infrastructure, and economic growth) blended into each other, thus turning making their eventual quarrel more personal. (It was notable enough then to receive media coverage and even a quip from David Brinkley.) This chill slowly thaws after 1960 to warm greetings between both men and their wives in the aftershock of John Kennedy's 1963 funeral.<br /><br />The book could have used more personal reflections; admittedly few may have been actively available for discussion, but only Eisenhower's son John is extensively quoted apart from written correspondence. Nonetheless, \\"Harry and Ike\\" is worthwhile reading for anyone interested in the key post-war years, allowing us another look at the seismic events of the early Cold War through the eyes of two of America's most beloved presidents.

Dick Morris has axes to grind. The former Clinton pollster and advisor and current Fox News analyst is angry at America's newspaper of record and much of its news media, both houses of Congress and his former president/boss, a now-vilified ally, many of governors, leading businesses, and its celebrities.<br /><br />It's a long list, and in \\"Off With Their Heads\\" Morris wildly swings his pen like a terrible swift sword to execute each for their own treason. Morris skillfully uses quotes, historical backdrop and his understanding behind statistics to paint a compelling picture of what he calls \\"what happens when men and women acquire sufficient power over others that abuse becomes almost inevitable.\\"<br /><br />The more personal the abuse, the stronger and more compelling Morris' writing. He makes emotional cases for neglect of the elderly at for-profit nursing homes, explaining why that business model cannot provide care those people need and deserve while exposing the near-sinister reasoning behind it. Morris attacks Big Tobacco industry with equal, gleeful anger, richly describing huge awards the industry paid for attracting young people on to the habit while condemning state governors (including California's since-deposed Gray Davis) for not putting the money back into anti-smoking campaigns.<br /><br />Morris' understanding of government inner workings, especially during his two years with the Clinton administration, has been the subject of several books and is also revealed here. He carves well-known legislators like Clinton and Christopher Dodd for allowing accounting firms to slip away from the lawsuits  formed from 2002's Enron/Arthur Anderson/Adelphia Cable scandals.<br /><br />Morris saves particular venom for Clinton's poor to non- existent handling of terrorist threats in North Korea, Iran, and Iraq (especially Saddam Huessein's rise in the immediate years following the first Gulf War.) He uses a French term, \\"Apres Moi, le deluge,\\" (after me, the disaster) to describe the world handed President Bush right up to and beyond 9-11's horror. (Morris disagrees with many Bush domestic policies but knows and likes where Bush stands on the war on terror.)<br /><br />That French phrase eases into Morris skewering America's least favorite \\"ally\\" for obstructing US attempts to avenge and stop Middle Eastern terrorism. Morris makes a convincing case for France being an American intellectual adversary due to latent anti-Semitism, cultural jealousy and past economic dealings with Saadam and other terrorist regimes. (This chapter also challenges a common view that the Iraq war squandered worldwide goodwill after 9-11.)<br /><br />Cultural jealousy also plays into the book's weakest chapters. Morris attacks Howell Raines' run as editor of the New York Times (before Jayson Blair's scandal ended it) for leftist bias in polling, story selection and placement. He vilifies a favorite conservative target, Hollywood celebrities, authors and playwrights whose eloquent but mis-informed and often misleading quotes discouraged many fighting for and supporting freedom. (Despite effective quote use and even some welcome wit among the non-stop slashing, this chapter is among Morris' weakest and unfocused; he quotes political apologists like Clinton and Sen Adlai Stevenson III beside Natalie Mains of the Dixie Chicks and Harry Belafonte's insult of Colin Powell.)<br /><br />The pen remains mightier than the sword, and Morris' writing can be as dull and numbers-laden as sharp and emotional when using analogy and anecdote.

Former Elle editor Jean-Dominique Bauby dictated it letter by letter to his assistant Claude using an alphabet variation he describes (and one hard to master as Bauby acknowledges in one vignette.) Its 129 pages consist of one to two page episodes describing piece by piece how \\"locked-in\\" syndrome, caused by a brain stem accident, transformed Elle editor Bauby's cosmopolitan life to one of memories and fantasies within the \\"diving bell\\" of his body.<br /><br />Within that \\"diving bell,\\" Bauby holds the irony and humor of any sophisticate or executive. His stories are never cloying or mawkish even when telling of his heartbreaking day at the beach with his children or his dread of Sundays without visitors or even staff. Rather, his sardonic humor allows him to see personal and professional foibles (staff members striking Elvis poses, nurses waking him for a sleeping bill, colleagues finding it hard to see him as he is now) in a new light.<br /><br />But the book is best when Bauby's mind travels the world above his bed to fantasies and an outside life slipping from him. He races Formula One cars, recreates scenes from the \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" and other books and films, savors his remaining senses to smell and taste foods he loves even while fed through a tube. (Sounds aren't lost to him either; his daughter's singing and even classic Beatles tunes play heavily into Bauby's memories and new life.)<br /><br />\\"The Diver Bell and the Butterfly\\" is as powerful a pro-life argument as has been written. It examines the frustration and resilience of any one who lost their ability to command their bodies. Enthusiastically recommended, but I'd also welcome an expanded version with those knowing and working closely with Bauby until his death.	2004-09-22

Its strict terms (Germany accepting full blame for the war, losing territory across three continents, huge reparations) for generations were blamed for Adolf Hitler's rise and the start of World War II. In \\"Paris 1919,\\" Margaret MacMillan, history professor and great-granddaughter of peace negotiator David Lloyd George, refutes that argument yet draws a line from that day in Paris to nearly every subsequent battle and border dispute.<br /><br />MacMillan sketches individual personalities, motivations, fears and leadership styles: the charming, befuddled negotiator Lloyd George, idealistic US president Woodrow Wilson, and wily French prime minister Georges Clemenceau (joined briefly by Italian leaders Vittorio Orlando and Sidney Sonninno.)She draws evocative pictures of Paris during that period, remaining compelling even when chronicling their leisure time.<br /><br />From stuffy palace conference rooms, MacMillan pulls back to the personalities within a world map circa 1919 (and includes drawn maps to start the book). Nations defeated (Rumania, Austria-Hungary, Turkey) emerging (Albania), or victimized (Belgium) parade past the Big Four pleading their cases. Some hope to restore glory, (chapters on Poland and Greece), maintain political and territorial security (Italy's pursuit of Fiume includes the fascinating adventures of Italian hero Gabriele D'Annunzino) or seek national identity. To that end, Japan's emerging nationalism and military strength is sadly predicted;  Allied refusal to include anti-discriminatory language in the treaty is blamed for Japanese nationalism, aggression in China, and its eventual attack on Pearl Harbor.)<br /><br />Wilson's \\"Fourteen Points,\\" which he compromised in Paris then obstinately held to for in a losing Congressional cause, makes him this book's tragic figure and, if not America's worst president, certainly its most disappointing. His lofty principles (briefly making him a messanic figure in MacMillan's first chapters) tragically fall to nationalism, ambition, fear, and politics.<br /><br />Wilson's vague concept of \\"self-determination,\\" which with the League of Nations were lynchpins of his Fourteen Points, arises consistently as leaders settle claims and untangle treaties across the Balkans to Palestine (and Zionism) and the Ottoman Empire. MacMillan concludes by saying traditional European paternalism and imperialism in the Third World helped undermine the peace process, causing hatreds and subsequent battles the reader can trace to the ongoing US liberation of Iraq. She even shows the concept's gruesome irony in that succinct conclusion.)<br /><br />\\"Paris 1919\\" does more than drop names and dates and redraws maps (This as future world leaders from Hoover to Churchill to FDR to Ho Chi Minh step into scenes throughout). Ms. MacMillan allows not only individuals but nationalities, even countries and histories their own personality. She tells each story empathetically as much as achievable, to its ironic, often tragic conclusion. Understanding the dashed hopes following those six months in 1919 is essential to understanding world conflict since.  Ms. MacMillan's near-flawless book is a thorough, entertaining way to read it.

Albom's main character is an elderly amusement park maintenance man named Eddie (which Albom notes was based on his uncle), who marks time in his life through a series of birthdays frustrated and crossed with funerals and family conflicts, and through park attractions changing names and styles.<br /><br /> But when Eddie dies in a park tragedy trying to save a young girl, he enters a heaven Albom only paints as the ultimate virtual reality attraction. In it, five people drawn from his life's story appear to explain how their lives intertwined with his and the afterlife lesson you must draw from them. (Much of the root of this, without giving the story away, relies on the popular \\"six degrees of separation\\" idea.)<br /><br /> What this leaves you with in \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" is a richly detailed backdrop: evocative pictures of seashore parks, dank one room apartments, mundane funeral arrangements, even wartime prison camps. Fitting the book's fantasy theme, Albom's characters are as one-dimensional as the characters in a boardwalk video arcade.<br /><br /> Albom sends Eddie to a circus performer, an army captain, family members, each holding a step of heaven idealizing their respective earthly lives. They provide long-awaited answers to painful questions constantly asked or subconsciously hidden (Albom effectively portrays the physical and mental anguish Eddie goes through.) Each attempts to provide life closure which eludes us all on earth. For its many faults, the book attempts an answer to a basic human question: What meaning did my life have? (Albom mentions his view of heaven is \\"only a guess,\\" which makes sense as he hasn't seen the real place yet.)<br /><br /> Yet Albom's heaven is not one earned by a Savior's life and death, faith, good works or even divine providence (the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" and God directly are mentioned once each). His pithy character dialogue (especially a mawkish yet distrurbing climactic scene with the fifth person Eddie meets) assemble a paradise without judgment or purification, only fulfillment.<br /><br /> The book's charms reflect its pop culture touchstones in stories like \\"Christmas Carol,\\" \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" and even some of Earl Hamner's sentimental scripts for the old \\"Twilight Zone\\" series. Dialogue between Eddie and his beloved Marguerite is sincere and tender on earth as it is in heaven. It serves as the book's anchor, consistent with a heaven faithful people believe in and want.

Marty cites this as a notable enough blurring of public and private religious practice, considering the still recent history of Clinton's adultery, perjury, and subsequent impeachment.<br /><br />But the date- September 11, 1998 -only recalls the same date three years later when worldwide religious and political ends met with unspeakable horror in New York City, Washington, DC and rural Pennsylvania.  Although written before 9-11 and George W. Bush's election, \\"Politics, Religion, and the Common Good,\\" is a timely, cautionary study of how faith-filled people should dialogue in American public life.<br /><br />The book grew from the Public Religion Project, organized by Professor Marty at the University of Chicago where he has taught and chaired for 35 years. It was the first of a two-part paper drawing from sponsored conversations to \\"promote efforts and bring to light and interpret the forces of faith in a pluralistic society.\\"<br /><br />Marty's writing style (he wrote the book with Jonathan Moore) is scholarly and objective (if a bit aloof) and his approach thorough. He examines benefits religious foundation brings to public debate through churchgoer, interest group, congregation, denomination. He consistently demonstrates the blurry line dividing church and state in everything from tax law to historic preservation to faith-based efforts combating homelessness, hunger, abortion and war.  But he also acknowledges political factions dividing religious groups,  who often point to the same scriptures to justify their opposing ends.<br /><br />Marty also invokes history to prove his points. He shows the roots of \\"separation of church and state,\\" showing how founding fathers James Madison and Thomas Jefferson interpreted a phrase which influenced American law without being included in even one of its key documents. He also discusses unity of religion in the rise of the ecumenical movement, its attempts at social change and the politics it requires for unity.<br /><br />You wish Marty could have written the entire book with the panache and passion of his final chapter, where he urges people of faith to join the national debate and let their voices be civilly heard to solve problems. Yet, despite some obtuse prose, \\"Politics, Religion, and the Common Good,\\" is a quick-reading level-setting volume introducing players and playbook in faith-based political debate. Worthwhile reading in an election year based on ideology, and highly recommended.without being included in even one of its key documents.

Nixon"	MSNBC host and news columnist Christopher Matthews charts the rivalry of \\"Kennedy v. Nixon\\" as backstory and inspiration behind most of America's post-World War II history. His meticulous research and breezy storytelling style creates a psychological/historical drama mixed with Shakespearean tragedy and some hilarious, touching anecdotes.<br />In it, Richard Nixon, the 37th president who resigned under pressure from the Watergate scandal, battles the ambitions, then the \\"Camelot\\" mythology of President John F. Kennedy, who defeated Nixon in 1960's close, contested election. Nixon is then shadowed throughout his political life by memories of the slain president: first by brother Robert, (a likely 1968 candidate before his assassination), and finally youngest brother Edward Kennedy.<br />\\"Kennedy vs. Nixon\\" tells a story of personal friendship souring under political differences and career paths. It shows how these cordial political colleagues who shared a hallway both opposed what they saw as Yalta's squandered victory after World War II, and fought Communist insurgency and infiltration domestically and internationally. Matthews traces their roles in the era's major events, all playing against a Cold War backdrop: tacit support for Joe McCarthy's investigations, distrust of Alger Hiss as Nixon prosecuted him, 1952's infamous \\"Checkers\\" speech preserving Nixon's vice-presidential candidacy even as President Dwight Eisenhower coldly minimizes Nixon's accomplishments and even attempts to remove him.<br />During these chapters Matthews reveals the start of Nixon's legendary personal distrust, hinted when vanquished Congressional opponent Helen Douglas branded him \\"Tricky Dicky.\\" Here Matthews also introduces characters (Archibold Cox, Charles Colson, Larry O'Brien) who became household names less than 15 years later as henchmen for or targets of Nixon's need to retain power . You also see the slow roots of America's painful Vietnam involvement, and how it helped fuel Nixon's 1968 comeback victory.<br />The core of the book is dedicated to 1960's presidential election and TV's major role in its presentation and outcome. Matthews meticulously retells 1960's \\"Great Debate\\" and how Nixon's TV image which, compared to Kennedy's carefully crafted public persona (and what Nixon saw as creative counting) painfully cost him that election. But recounting private taped and untaped unconversations, you sense both men's anger and frustration against enemies foreign (Kennedy's Bay of Pigs, and 1963's assassination of South Vietnam president Ngo Dihn Diem) and domestic (Nixon's \\"Saturday Night Massacre,\\" his palpable need to discredit Ted Kennedy even after 1969's Chappaquiddick tragedy ended any hopes for his presidential run.)<br />Matthews effectively argues Ted Kennedy's threat as fueling Nixon's self-destruction, but adds Nixon's suspicions were justified. From being used by Kennedy's wealthy father as pawn for President-elect Kennedy before the inauguration, to  investigated for loans given Nixon's brother Donald (for \\"Nixonburgers\\"), to Ted Kennedy's role in prosecuting Watergate, Nixon felt constantly chased by Kennedy legacy and perceptions he only held space until another Kennedy \\"restoration\\" and couldn't compete with Kennedy' carefully written legacy. This leads to several bitter but even  hilarious anecdotes (the ones about the phony train conductor, the pregnant woman and the beach photo opportunity being three favorites).<br />Even in Nixon's declining, post-retirement years, his foreign policy expertise respected and presidency re-examined, he couldn't hide antipathy for his 1960 rival and events leading America to the Vietnam war always associated with Nixon's presidency. Even his 1994 death was shadowed a few weeks later by that of President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline (with whom Nixon shared sweet and sincere correspondence after Ms. Kennedy's family visited Nixon's White House in 1971.) It is a somber, fitting ending to Matthews' remarkably told story, whose details provided deeper, long-missing reasons behind some of history's tragic, yet seismic events. \\"Kennedy vs. Nixon\\" is a recommended story addressing personal and political clashes between two of American history's most significant, forever fascinating figures.hews' remarkably told story, whose details provided deeper, long-missing reasons behind some of history's tragic, yet seismic events. \\"Kennedy vs. Nixon\\" is a recommended story addressing personal and political clashes between two of American history's most significant, forever fascinating figures.	2004-03-06

He assembled much of his oral history through transcribed interviews and journals for what would be his autobiography, which he planned to write before dying in 1971.<br />His family, most notably son Christopher, assembled \\"At Random\\" from Cerf's exhaustive life chronicles. His family focused it, according to their introduction, \\"primarily about publishing and (Cerf's) pre-eminent role in it.\\"<br />The result is a fascinating story which assembles Cerf's life and career as businessman, newspaperman, TV celebrity and, finally, his role as husband, father, and friend (a lovingly remembered childhood, glimpses of his marriages and family, loving remembrances of friends and co-workers from George Gershwin to Moss Hart.)<br />Cerf knew and published some of the 20th century's most well-known and beloved authors. \\"At Random\\" teems with anecdotes and personal remembrances of James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Dorothy Parker, Sinclair Lewis (with some frank critique of his career), William Faulkner, and Ayn Rand. Cerf also crosses paths with legends like New York's Cardinal Spellman (who shares an unusual lunch date with author John O'Hara) Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, and General David Sarnoff who, at the book's conclusion, clashes with Cerf over a fraction in Random House's sale price to RCA.<br />\\"At Random\\" has much to teach about publishing, its machinations and the egos and careers of its stars, the authors. But you come away wanting to know Bennett Cerf better: his political liberalism, hot temper, love of celebrity and of language. He hints at each in his narrative, only leading you to wish other quotes and remembrances could have been included in an addendum to this lovingly compiled book.. (Excerpts from some of his still popular pun collections may have helped.)<br />\\"At Random\\" examines the life and legacy of a celebrity too rare amid an increasingly sordid and more coarse media landscape - an author and businessman who became a TV celebrity first, celebrating the brief period when books were as anticipated and celebrated as films and recorded music are today.

Week after week in more than 500 newspapers including the Miami Herald (motto, according to Dave, \\"Serving a Vibrant Community of Two Million People of whom 23 speak English\\"), humor columnist Dave Barry manages to be clever and funny, at times hilarious. Yet he provides running commentary on little and large American events and foibles within them.<br />\\"Boogers Are My Beat\\" is appropriately titled as Barry finding humor in the first, most surreal and undignified events of the new millennium. He covers (while trying to find a beer) 2000's Salt Lake City Olympics with its controversial figure skating judgement (\\"Don't Trust Any Judge With Two First Names\\"). He finds protestors and parties in that year's political conventions (featuring a cute column on sharing more than TV time with Rev. Jerry Falwell and daily scatalogical updates on that year's Gore-Leiberman ticket). That year's historic George Bush election, with its infamous focus on Barry's South Florida backyard, results in a series of funny yet prescient columns.<br />Barry also finds kinder humor at smaller events in smaller towns. He visits Grand Forks, ND and attends a special dedication ceremony, a trip to a different type of mountain with an author who'd climbed Everest, then does everything from park an RV at Wal-Mart to attend a Miami swingers convention (creating a funny essay without resorting to offensive humor, a neat trick.) Barry's infant daughter also inspires columns on everything from her favorite music and movies to planning extravagant birthday parties to getting her (and himself) through airport security. (His column about trying to swat a butterfly, featuring a trusted guest corroborator, is hands down the book funniest piece.)<br />Two Barry columns conclude the book somberly. His piece written the day after 9/11 is confused yet seethes with righteous anger, addressing what most people still feel to this day. His column from Gettysburg and Shanksville, PA (where Flight 93 crashed while its passengers bravely fought the terrorists) allows Barry to use his gifts of character observation and detail, the strength of his humor writing, to moving, dramatic effect.<br />Barry has his humor trademarks: rearranging letters to spell a rock band or odd phrase, chronicles of his concerts featuring a rock band made of famous authors.

Milton Viorst has used these documents to launch a nimble (less than 370 pages and easily read in excerpts) world history filling and fleshing out much of the US-centric history learned in those same dry textbooks.<br />Viorst's well chosen excerpts (from personal writings and speeches as well as sealed docuemnts) and his taut, even witty introductions serve as puzzle pieces to assemble man's slow struggle to free himself and his surroundings from repression and tyranny (Magna Carta, Mayflower Compact, Declaration of Independence). He then uses them to build cases for the worldwide political and cultural changes which followed (revolutionaries from Simon Bolivar to Garibaldi, the fall of dynasties from France's Bourbon monarchy to the Russian czars.)<br />Viorst also uses \\"Great Documents\\" to chart struggles and the changing role of power within the Catholic Church. He charts from its early temporal strength (Pope Siricius' decretal) to Martin Luther's Reformation and its bloody aftermath, to its role in the French and German monarchies to, finally, its moral assertions in Pope Leo XIII's \\"Reram Novarum\\" encyclical, which defined its new (and, to Viorst, most praiseworthy) role to this day.<br />Although \\"Great Documents\\" could use an update, it's fitting that it ends with the high-ideals expressed in the United Nations charter (in itself a continuation of themes first expressed in Woodrow Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations). That document seemed then to provide some closure and hope after the unspeakable horrors of the 20th century's first half (Viorst calls Hitler's announcement of Germany's invasion of Russia \\"a moment of salvation for the world.\\") It also pre-dated a time when nearly all defining world moments would be listened to, watched, and clicked on before they would be written, read, or signed.<br />Nonetheless, \\"Great Documents in Western Civilization\\"(which also features an exhaustive list of future reading) is must-read for anyone wanting to more deeply understand evolving political and social systems with the high ideals and failed attempts which followed.

He allows us to see through the eyes of British artists (Fanny Kemble) authors (Charles Dickens, Civil War reporter \\"Bull Run\\" Russell) and adventurers (Frank Harris, Richard Burton) trying to understand and succeed in a growing country just understanding itself.<br />\\"Eden\\" touches on the seismic events between 1820-1890: slavery, the Civil War and reconstruction, taming of the American West, manifest destiny, the Chicago fire and the start of Mark Twain's \\"Gilded Age.\\" But letters, newspaper stories, biographies and other first person period literature allow Simmons to show the humanity behind them even at its most graphic (Part II, covering \\"The Western Frontier,\\" contains most of the book's goriest images.)<br />You read of Dickens' \\"quarrel with America\\" over copyright infringement and Frances Trollope's disgust with perceived American misogyny, egalitarianism and even table manners. These resulted in two books causing national furor and turning American goodwill against their respective authors. (Several chapters repeat disgust with tobacco spittle and a savage American press.) Most notably, in Kemble's chapter, Simmons shows how America's shame of slavery tears a nation and family asunder.<br />But each of Simmons' subjects is astounded at America's natural beauty (most notably west of the Mississippi) and earnestness even while complaining of crude manners or(as Oscar Wilde did  wittily in the chapter on his American tour)aesthetics.<br />Simmons allows some sense of closure when saying those gleaning the most from their American experience assimilated themselves best into it. This covered episodes from Wilde drinking American friends and rivals under the table to Burton and mountain man George Puxton adapting clothes, mannerisms and even speech from their new neighbors. This contrasts with Trollope and Dickens who,in Simmons words, \\"had no appreciation of America as a vigorous, expanding nation.\\" Through his anecdotes, Simmons allows you to see American growing pains his characters often could not.<br />Simmons' only misstep is forgiveable. In Wilde's chapter he tells of presidential assassin Charles Guiteau, whose trial and execution for shooting James Garfield becomes a media circus, prefacing celebrity trials even as he identifies Wilde as \\"the first modern celebrity...famous for being famous.\\" You expect Simmons to make a larger point on Guiteau's perverse interpretation of what Wilde considered the art of his own life, but Simmons never quite does. (It would also have helped to read of Wilde's meeting fellow iconoclast Ambrose Bierce.)<br />Regardless, Simmons succeeds at the aim of his acknowledgements. \\"With proper research and attention to the small details of place, action, and character,\\" he writes, \\"formal history could be written to read as easily and effortlessly as the finest historical romance.\\" Indeed, Simmons successfully wraps American hisory around his characters' adventures in \\"Star-Spangled Eden\\" (and includes a superb bibliography), making his an offbeat, informative and even reasssuring history lesson.ickens who,in Simmons words, \\"had no appreciation of America as a vigorous, expanding nation.\\" Through his anecdotes, Simmons allows you to see American growing pains his characters often could not.<br />Simmons' only misstep is forgiveable.

These allow the reader to start at any point, quickly and accurately capturing the pieces' spirit and influence. (Some readings may need re-reading to fully understand and will take longer than the advertised half-hour.) But if anything, Finnemore steps too far back; he presents one-paragraph biographies of his choice authors, then rolls out their works without explaining their influence to their times and each other.<br />William James references Mill, Rosseau criticizes Christianity for teaching submissiveness, Kant references Descartes and, in turn, \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\" is referenced throughout each new philosophy study up to \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" Reading Thomas Jeffererson's \\"Declaration of Independence against Paine's \\"The Rights of Man,\\" allows a sense of the uniquely American enlightenment in America's first century, producing  these and the spirit behind Thoreau's \\"Civil Disobedience.\\"  Lacking an historical timeline joining these disparate, influential voices misses the chance to understand their gradual evolution. (Speaking of evolution, it may surprise many to know Charles Darwin's argument against Creation theory was not one against a Creator's existence.)<br />If a narrative voice before or in between selections placed these essays in context amongst and against each other,  The discovery and even wit fueling them could have made this an essential colloquium and summary of classical thought.  If Finnemore even provided a bibliography or appendix, translating some of the foreign phrases quoted, he could have created at least a significant introductory philosophy volume. As it is, \\"Half Hours With the Best Thinkers\\" keeps its editor's of a &quot;concise overview of the ideas which shook the world.&quot; Yet despite its pieces of essential reading, it's but a cloudy, choppy Cliff Notes written in the authors' own words.at least a significant introductory philosophy volume.

Keyes uses Wilde's plays, reviews, letters, interrogations, even conversational repartee (given its own section) which remained Wilde's signature to his time.<br />Keyes divides Wilde's epigrams and puns into brief, easily readable sections. Wilde twists traditional views on permanent truths and those of his day: altruism (\\"Charity creates a multitude of sins.\\") history (\\"History is merely gossip.\\") theology,  poverty, dissent (\\"Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.&quot;)<br />Above all, Wilde (through Keyes' selections) quips and dissects each of the fine arts (music, prose, painting) and roles for creator, viewer, interpreter.  He addresses the writer (\\"Even prophets correct their proofs.\\")  critic (\\"Criticism is the highest form of autobiography\\"), and  artist (\\"Like the Greek gods, artists are known only to each other.\\")<br />Amid his fast-paced one liners on male-female relations you sense how Wilde viewed marriage over and above his well-known bromide, \\"Divorces are made in heaven.\\" The book ends with Wilde explaining and defending the homosexual relationship he called \\"the love that dare not speak its name\\". Whether or not you accept Wilde's lifestyle preferences, his eloquent, sad defense of a letter he wrote a younger man is moving as he describes the unique merge of intellect and youthful energy which to him formed \\"the noblest sort of affection.\\" It is as close to heartfelt as anyone could get who once said,  \\"A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal.\\"<br />Oscar Wilde was parodied, villified, and eventually imprisoned for his beliefs and flamboyance. But he eventually influenced artists from George Bernard Shaw to John Lennon, staking a claim as the earliest example of a postmodern artist. This book helps introduce Wilde's full books and plays (Keyes references them consistently and provides a full bibliography), or helps you reference witty, intellectual (or psuedo-intellectual, as Wilde might have preferred) quotes for any occassion. (As to plagarizing, Wilde himself called it, \\"the privilege of the appreciative man.\\") His full literary courses are nutritious and filling enough, but \\"The Wit and Wisdom of Oscar Wilde\\" is as savory when reading or writing as salt is when dining.s the earliest example of a postmodern artist.

This has been true in theater, on radio (Christian rock pioneer Larry Norman's wailing \\"Why should the devil have all the good music?\\") at toy stores and bookstands. J.K. Rowling's wildly successful Harry Potter book series is notable here, its themes of supernatural powers, combined with huge sales to pre-teens, inspiring criticism and even misguided protests such as library lawsuits and book burnings.<br />Recently, however, many conservative Christians have come to respect the Potter books for sophisticated portrayals of good and evil. Connie Neal addresses her Potter interpretation \\"The Gospel According to Harry Potter\\" to these Christians plus the few left who remain hostile toward a book series many of them  never read.<br />Ms. Neal traverses through the first four Potter books, summing overlaying themes of each. She selects episodes (standing on the 9 ¾ platform, the shrinking door keys mystery, Ginny Weasley's rescue), character profiles (false faces of Professor Quirrell and Mad-Eye Moody, consistent citing of Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore as a God-like figure) and character quotes. She then relates this at length to a Biblical story or theme, constantly focusing on the panoramic, constant battle between good and evil and subtleties within it. (Neal states on its front cover no one involved with the Potter series proper has authorized this book. Perhaps this is reason Neal provides a teaspoon of Potter followed by two cups of Bible.)<br />Ms. Neal, perhaps for Christian unity or not wanting to put Christian words into Harry's lightning-scarred head, fails somewhat to directly contradict anti-Potter views or any of the series' darker themes. (In personal asides, she recalls criticism received in radio and TV interviews and dealing with fallout from a satirical story on the Onion Web site relating Potter to Satanism.)<br />A librarian at a Micigan Christian school and webmaster of one of the larger Harry Potter sites recently said of Rowling,\\"She is writing extremely moral books that show that evil is real and you have to take a stand against it, even at great cost to yourself.&quot; Connie Neal effectively relates that bedrock Biblical truth to Harry's spiritual quest. She also compares friends, enemies, mentors, and wolves dressed as sheep Harry encounters to Jesus' own ministry, while retaining Jesus' divinity and Harry's mortality.<br /> To that end, the \\"Gospel According to Harry Potter\\" is useful to homilists and Sunday school teachers wanting to relate today's most popular action-adventure story with the first and truest. This book allows non-Potter readers to effectively discuss the series with those who've read them.

You come to care for the TV producer who consoles a friend and eyes a nurse in &quot;The Shallowest Man.&quot; You feel a painful twinge at the father-son dialogue closing the otherwise nonsensical &quot;The Diet.&quot; You also  sense the balding, hairy Kugelmass' giddy joy as he romances Emma Bovary and changes literature in &quot;Kugelmass Episode.&quot; (Few main male characters in Allen's stories here are as attractive as the women they pursue.)

Several passages need rereading to understand fully, not from Ken Davis' writing (which remains concise despite some shoehorned pop culture references) as from the subject of an ever-expanding, changing universe being difficult to get your arms around to start with. Moreover, a book describing awe-inspiring star and planet activity could provide better illustrations and photos than some old New Yorker cartoons.<br />That said, Ken Davis' \\"Don't Know Much\\" template has allowed him to write a best-selling series of books introducing and explaining everything from geography to the Bible to the Civil War, plus a separate children's book series and popular Web site. \\"Don't Know Much About The Universe\\" continued his successful series. Davis allows you to see and understand  the universe's wonder while detailing the human drama it often inspired.<br />In doing so, Davis knows when to express opinion (giving his on John Glenn's 1997 return to space and the hidden agenda in 1986's Challenger tragedy) and when to stand back while offering many.(His final chapter, \\"The Old One's Secrets,\\" deftly describes theories surrounding how the universe began while continuing to consider Creator involvement. He also however, drops in references to \\"Oklahoma!\\" and Gertrude Stein.)<br />As with his other books, Davis tells his story as a series of answered questions covering everything from life on distant planets to new understandings of scientific icons (Galileo, Werner von Braun, Albert Einstein). Throughout \\"Don't Know Much,\\" Davis effectively describes opposition these and other astronomy heroes faced from government (investigated Einstein,  forced accused war criminal Arthur Rudolph from the country), Roman Catholicism (which cleared Gallileo 10 years ago for writings nearly 400 years before) and even rivalry within its own ranks (Issac Newton's story here is particularly instructive.) Davis also charts a timeline of astronomy's historic events and provides a lengthy bibliography and list of recommended magazines and Web sites.<br />Somehow amidst the star-struck name dropping (plentiful but which, to be fair, lightened and even explained more difficult concepts), Davis somehow missed a quote from the rock band the Eagles: \\"Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky/you can see the stars but still not see the light.\\" For anyone looking at the stars inspired to know more of their origins and activity, \\"Don't Know Much\\" provides a illuminating, compact look at an ever expanding subject.ore) and even rivalry within its own ranks (Issac Newton's story here is particularly instructive.)

Lewis' legendary \\"Screwtape Letters\\" is at once soul and brain food.<br />Lewis tells his story through the title character, an experienced devil instructing his apprentice nephew to lure a young man to condemnation. The apprentice, Wormwood, tempts with everything from family (distancing prayers for the man's mother from behavior toward her) to social circle (flippant friends stray him from his new life, a new girlfriend moves him closer to it) to work and even worship.<br />Lewis then flips God's love and law into effective, ironic Satanic reverses. He shows temptation most effective and deadly in its smallest doses: prayer posture, creation and consideration of an Historical Point of View (including an historical Jesus as opposed to One of faith). Lewis redefines gluttony, defends Puritanism, shows the misunderstanding of romantic feelings in love and sex, and misperception of the large ever-broken promise, \\"The Future.\\" (This book must be read if only to debunk one of Henry Ford's most famous quotes and the cliched, selfish phrase \\"impose on my time.\\")<br />Lewis shows (and Screwtape plants) the landmines of an early Christian walk: the role of a Church, of humor and the temptation inherent in its roots, Christian truth made trivial and a commodity beside social causes.  He even dissects everyday, mundane pleasures (books, walks, music, wine, dated references to cigarettes) for their own sake and not as means to follow an ever more mediocre crowd.<br />Lewis' final Screwtape letter is his most moving. Sarcasm joins sanctification as we learn target's and tempter's final fate.  It ties to themes present throughout Lewis' letters and providing fodder for his conjoined, equally humorous essay, Screwtape Proposes A Toast:  \\"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one...without milestones, without signposts...\\" This absolutely essential book is just such signpost; \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is joyful, instructional, fun reading for anyone wishing to know what forces fight for the human soul...\\" This absolutely essential book is just such signpost; \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is joyful, instructional, fun reading for anyone wishing to know what forces fight for the human soul.	2003-06-10

Clever turns of phrase and crisp, engaging writing style (in an easily referenced question and answer format) allow historian Kenneth Davis to chart American history and debunk many of its myths in this exceptional update of his 1990 best-seller.<br />Drawing on reports of the period and on revisionist histories, Davis concisely shows the humanity in American icons known only by one name: Lincoln's views on race relations, Washington's at times bawdy sense of humor, Franklin Roosevelt's thirst for power and gift for political (and apparently, personal) compromise, Ford and Lindbergh's disquieting bigotry and animosity.  (Robert E. Lee's quote on slavery's positive effects show him, despite honors afforded him in the Civil War's losing cause, very much a man of his time.)  Davis also provides short biographies of historic's outstanding black voices, from Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. DuBois' passion to the Mohammad Ali's athletic urban poetry.<br />Davis also shows a refreshing desire not to be objective, a rarity in books like this. He attacks the nation's great shames (treatment of Native and African Americans, Japanese-American internment during World War II), targeting history's cynics and opportunists whose names still ring of American royalty: Vanderbilt, JP Morgan, Rockefeller, even the Kennedys. (Davis' coverage of the reasons and results of 1898's  Spanish-American War will disturb those always thinking Americans fought defensively and for the right causes.) Davis also explains the interlocking events which started WWI, which (should you choose to read the book cover to cover) pour into every other tragic conflict which followed up to and including September 11.<br />Davis misses some steps covering the last 30 years. He covers Watergate in depth, including an events timeline, which he does for every war covered in the book. But he glosses over Richard Nixon's historic trip to China and for that matter, much of the Ford-Carter years. He again retells Monica Lewinsky's affair with President Bill Clinton but fails to capture (in fact, hardly mentions) the Whitewater and Travelgate scandals inspiring Ken Starr's investigation and staining Clinton's administration and legacy.<br />Davis` summary of American tragedies tying into September 11's horror is heartfelt but forced. But he also explains Electoral College and US Constitution, charts the US presidents, and provides an exhaustive list of referred readings to complete an exceptionally exciting retelling of history. \\"Don't Know Much About History\\" is a title only true until the book is completed; it is exceptionally helpful as a primer and essential as a supplementary history book.glosses over Richard Nixon's historic trip to China and for that matter, much of the Ford-Carter years.

He recalls the Hall's strong-willed, soft-hearted entreprenuers, Larry Bornstein and Allen and Sandra Jaffe. He carefully charts musical and personal histories of band members and local legends like trombonist Jim Robinson, drummer Cie Frazier and irrepressible pianist 'Sweet' Emma Barrett (who judging from her spotlight among several breakout pieces, was  often sour, bitter, or salty). You realize, as it stands amidst seedy strip clubs and franchises like Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, Preservation Hall exists for those loving the music for what it does for and to them, not the flash it throws at them.<br />Carter writes that 'enjoy' has the impact in New Orleans 'achieve' has in the rest of the country. But as 'Preservation Hall' winds down you see those words as synonyms describing the feisty comeraderie these heritage musicians brought their work. You come to love their quirks on and offstage, (Carter splits his postscript between hilarious band anecdotes and heartfelt celebrity tributes). You see and hear joy they brought audiences worldwide, including US presidents, Supreme Court Justices and icons like Woody Allen, Frank Sinatra, and Mick Jagger. The Hall and its music helped draw tourists back to New Orleans when the city rebuilt its vacation trade on its jazz and party history. You mourn as original band members, for whom the Hall and its tours provided their long-running work and steadiest income, pass from the scene followed by their manager/mentors, Bornstein and Jaffe.<br />The book justifiably praises Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Kid Ory, Buddy Bolden and other legendary New Orleans jazzmen, whose spirits pervade every block of Bourbon Street and whose legacy the Hall preserves, not exploits. But sadly, it also charts unkind potshots from modern band members like Dr. Michael White. His disparaging comments about 'a bearded, pot-bellied guy standing there blasting Louis Armstrong solos at 90 miles an hour\\" seem aimed at Al Hirt and Pete Fountain, men who also loved classic New Orleans jazz, took it mainstream and whetted American appetite for it during the early 1960s \\"folk music\\" boom. This is an example of what is at best provincialism or what Carter calls 'Crow Jimism,' a reverse descrimination (acknowledged and hinted at in some of Jaffe's printed interview remarks) where every older black musician is thought more authentic, and thus better, at his instrument than his white counterpart.<br />'Preservation Hall' will delight those wanting to understand more about New Orleans' rich jazz history, or wanting an historical recreation broken up by hilarious anecdotes and great music. If the book came with a complete musician's list and discography (or better yet, a sample CD!) it would have been perfect.

His description of 1997's Marlins-Indians World Series accurately descibes how interminable and unapproachable the game had become in less than a decade.<br />Costas outlines his plan to address baseball's large and small, money and image issues: Pete Rose's Hall of Fame induction (he favors it while strongly opposing that gambling that got Rose suspended) the DH (he opposes it despite its extending the careers of stars like Eddie Murray) radical, georgaphical realignment (a disaster still discussed but earlier dismissed).<br />Costas' book is welcome because, unlike more emotional stories like David Halberstam's &quot;October 1964&quot; or Lupica's &quot;Summer of 98&quot; (both chronicling World Series which changed baseball's image) you don't smell the green grass and hear the bat crack. &quot;Fair Ball&quot; is the work not of a baseball poet (Costas' writing is broadcast-tight, although more charts and graphs would have made his revenue sharing plan more accessible ). Costas here is a baseball doctor diagnosing a decade's baseball owner obesity and union player gluttony, prescribing diet and weight redistribution.<br />Bob Costas' book is recommended reading for fans, those they cheer for (everyone should read Chapter Three, &quot;The Nature of Sports Leagues,&quot; among the most accurate descriptions of player perks and pressures), and all deriving employment, profit or pleasure from the national pastime.stas' book is recommended reading for fans, those they cheer for (everyone should read Chapter Three, &quot;The Nature of Sports Leagues,&quot; among the most accurate descriptions of player perks and pressures), and all deriving employment, profit or pleasure from the national pastime.	2001-07-10

Her curmudgonous &quot;Wasn't The Grass Greener&quot; finds her post-expulsion, wistfully remembering telegrams, clotheslines, radiators and tangible, fading societal remnants. Here she praises seasonal, small, slightly sinful luxuries readily available if occassionally politically incorrect.<br />Sensuality rules &quot;Endangered Pleasures&quot; in taste (coffee, martinis, even cigarettes), touch (bare feet, naked bodies in shower, bath and bed, wearing fur in an apologetic essay) sound (songs of youth, whistling, profanity), and above all, sight ( July 4, Christmas, books and morining paper, emotional blankets covering the four seasons, travel modes and motivations). Holland also indulges in slight sins of lust (morning sex), gluttony (justifications of the day's three meals), schadenfreude (her section on disasters and crowd behavior after the Phillies' 1980 World Series win) and supposed sloth (her defense of working and not working, and of gardening as a form of work, are alone worth the book price).<br />Holland also understands small, measurable triumphs of early childhood (&quot;the first 10 or 12 years are just one triumph after another&quot;) early adulthood (&quot;We studied for the career of being adults...we thought we had to have opinions on everything.&quot;)and parenthood (&quot;Having a child around is more fun than being one, since we're free to leave the small world for the large one whenever we get bored.&quot;)<br />Some Holland-praised pleasures became unpopular for understandable, if not completely agreeable, reasons. But she correctly states many benign indulgences fell to what author Robert Ringer called &quot;absolute morality,&quot; a governmental/societal/Puritanical mindset distrusting and discouraging pleasure as immoral and unfair while praising pain and self-denial as noble and necessary.

She assembles 33 missing social puzzle pieces, enjoyable independently, into a picture of how society now views personal comfort, leisure time, and social interaction.<br />Holland drew her vignettes for &quot;Wasn't The Grass Greener?&quot; living everywhere from Washington, DC (where she grew up and from which she writes a disturbing glorification of national wartime attitude) to Denmark (where she lived as a young adult, developing a fondness for homogeneity that mirrors Pat Buchanan's similar views on multiculturalism) to Philadelphia (where she raised her family and fondly remembers frozen ponds for skating and the old John Wanamaker department store).<br />She recalls the decline of such mundane activities as card playing (&quot;just another of those things...that caused us to visit our neighbors and invite them into our houses&quot;) and ice skating (&quot;nobody won or lost, which is not the American way and probably a bad influence on the young&quot;). She writes of home furnishings plain as a liquor cabinet or radiator (It was clean and it smoked not...(they) moderately (were) dispensing their measured flow of comfort, like grandmothers&quot;). She eventually rises to abstracts like worrying, idleness (&quot;Work stole our days, but entertainment took everything left over&quot;)or falling in love.  As she does, you realize Ms. Holland misses how things felt, not always how they were. The telegram's tangibility bests e-mail's cold type. The tavern's social jape and comfort, songs from parlor pianos, even old clothes hung from clotheslines show natural, tactile interaction American life now lacks.<br />Her essays prefer older, more personal entertainments to those from passive, antiseptic, solitary electronics. She prefers organic, commodious warmth over the constant chase for mechanized, articifically magnetized fads and fashions. She trusts people (&quot;When I was young, the doctor was God&quot;) over machines. She misses what united us, decries the cynicism and nihilism that divided and partially conquered us.<br />Holland frets about our needing protection from fear (of lawsuit and loss), at all costs from seen, unseen, and manufactured dangers. This insulation became isolation keeping temperatures steady, freeing us from harmless pranks, suntans and bugs at picnics. It kept children organized and supervised rather than left to their creative endeavors (this chapter, too, appears to advocate irresponsibility). It even kept our most intimate communications, love and sex, at virtual (reality) arm's length rather than forward to vulnerably falling in love.<br />Holland writes in refreshing, near-diary style, neither persuading nor entertaining objection. But fond memories, however curmudgeonly and well-written, do not excuse facts. Her otherwise humorous chapter on pianos hits a sour note when she writes, &quot;Imagine the Beatles carrying one around...nobody could wring a drop of juice out of rock on the piano.&quot; Huh? Little Richard, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ray Charles, Leon Russell, Elton John, Billy Joel? When rock was greener (pre-British Invasion), piano dominated the new style and remains prominent. (And yes, Paul McCartney played mean piano on the Beatles' rockers and Elvis allegedly played better piano than guitar).<br />Pink Floyd, who I doubt was heard much on Holland's parlor piano, once asked the musical question, &quot;Would you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?&quot; They answered years later, &quot;I have become comfortably numb.&quot; Leo Buscaglia once said he would choose feeling pain over nothing; his views were parodied unforgettably in the film &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; (the bohemian Bueller could be Ms. Holland's hero) and restated 33 different ways here.

He aims at too many targets with too many words, all familiar. He attacks education (a multicultural, nonsexist agenda emphasizing fairness over excellence), the arts (sacriligious paintings, films, TV, and music which Thomas sees promoting &quot;an increasingly nihilistic world view&quot;), high taxes funding activist government (villains include President and Mrs. Clinton in their first, most liberal years in office).<br />Above all, Thomas berates and builds his book around a 60s generation promising Eden rebuilt as flexible, materialistic, permissive paradise but delivering crime, drugs, divorce, despair, and death. Thomas condemns author/publishers Hugh Hefner, &quot;female Hefner&quot; Helen Gurley Brown, Carl Sagan, and Dr. Jack Kevorkian as gods of this false paradise. Woodstock-era song titles and lyrics ironically crop up throughout Thomas' chapters, broken into 2-4 page, easy-to-read segments.<br />Thomas' researched &quot;Matter Most&quot; for more than a year but failed to put his extensive quotes in context. His section, &quot;The Founding Fathers And Taxes&quot; glues historical anti-tax, anti-big government quotes with pithy comments; Thomas would have better juxtaposed those opinions against Johnson's &quot;Great Society&quot; and Bill Clinton's attempted revival in his 1993 budget. Entertainment was another missed opportunity; Thomas attacked the lyrics of Pink Floyd and &quot;band from Hell&quot; Guns N' Roses when he could have dissected their cries for shelter and order (&quot;Oh, won't you please take me home?&quot; &quot;We don't need no thought control,&quot; &quot;Where do we go, where do we go now?&quot;) making their pleas plead his case.<br />Thomas writes best on moral issues, consistent with his belief in lasting change stemming from within. Chapter 7 eloquently condemns worldwide death culture: abortion, euthanasia, attitudes toward the mentally challenged which concievably could include Thomas' handicapped brother Marshall.  Chapter 5, &quot;The Promise of God's Death,&quot; discusses how God as concept, not even as active life force, has been removed from public discourse as source for morality within law, as ultimate example of love, compassion, and sacrifice, and as judge of life's value. Thomas gladly enlists disparate celebrities like Norman Lear and Shirley McLaine in the drive to return spirituality to America's forefront.<br />&quot;The Things That Matter Most&quot; surrounds its timeless truths with old headlines, with too much under the bridge (Newt Gingrich's &quot;Contract With America,&quot; Clinton's re-election, the rise of George W. Bush) to justify its reprint. Thus Thomas, a needed voice in American political conversation with another book due this summer, is more effective commenting amid the daily headline trenches rather than in longer, more derivative attempts like this.sed opportunity; Thomas attacked the lyrics of Pink Floyd and &quot;band from Hell&quot; Guns N' Roses when he could have dissected their cries for shelter and order (&quot;Oh, won't you please take me home?&quot; &quot;We don't need no thought control,&quot; &quot;Where do we go, where do we go now?&quot;) making their pleas plead his case.<br />Thomas writes best on moral issues, consistent with his belief in lasting change stemming from within.

Author Jon Scieszka and illustrator Lane Smith know and capture the attraction to and repulsion from these timeless stories: fantastic settings, freakish, cliched characters, happy, humorless endings, misogynistic storylines (how many children must have believed \\"wicked stepmother\\" was one word?).<br /><br />\\"Where is that lazy author?\\" clucks the pesky Little Red Hen throughout the narrative and indeed, Scieszka could achieved more with this promising premise. Unlike Jay Ward's \\"Fractured Fairy Tales\\" from \\"The Bullwinkle Show\\" (against which \\"Stinky Cheese\\" crumbles), he deconstructs rather than parodies the originals' hoary storylines. Only \\"Cinderumpelstiltskin\\" (guess the plotline) and \\"Little Red Running Shorts\\" close i!n on \\"Fractured\\"'s subversive element, which parodied the stories' commercialization as often as the stories themselves. Scieszka's punch lines abruptly negate the originals' fantasy aspect (especially in the title story, \\"Other Frog Prince,\\" and \\"Princess and the Bowling Ball.\\")<br /><br />\\"Where is that lazy illustrator?\\" the hen continues, and Smith (who gives the hen her comeuppance in a Looney Tunes-esque finale) provides drawings more effectively parodying the tales' grotesque characterizations. Austere, earthy colors (browns, tans, and greens everywhere) join real animal sketches to his exaggerated ones (the \\"Frog Prince\\" scientifically identifies the insects on his tongue). Molly Leach's clever use of fonts and type sizes (especially in \\"Giant's Tale,\\" summarizing most fairy tale cliches in nine lines) express, more evocatively than Scieszka's text, the book's goal of satirizing children's books' structure. But, as any style-concious writer knows, font style, size, color, !or any other gimmick is no content substitute.<br /><br />\\"Stinky Cheese Man\\" is appropriate, transitional reading for early grade schoolers too young not to be read to but too old for the original tales (or old enough to read \\"MAD\\" magazine). Pre-schoolers may be frightened by Smith's jagged, exaggerated pictures; better they hear gentler, hipper takes (Disneyfied, Muppetized) of the originals. Children's authors since Dr. Suess has written in response to the simplistic, moralistic, austere plots and structure of young readers' literature. These self-described \\"Fairly Stupid Tales\\" weakly spray-paint rather than repaint the originals. Thus, it serves as one of the weaker examples in this genre.no content substitute.<br><br>\\"Stinky Cheese Man\\" is appropriate, transitional reading for early grade schoolers too young not to be read to but too old for the original tales (or old enough to read \\"MAD\\" magazine).

Its 317 pages do not debunk so much as dissect traditions which seemed to &quot;stand outside history.&quot; He sees larger points within about 18th and 19th century societal, racial, and cultural divides and Christmas' role in spurring American consumerist society.<br />Nissenbaum bookends &quot;Battle&quot; with accounts of New England's &quot;wassail&quot; tradition and of Christmas celebrations in the slavery South. He finds similar tales of pauper (peasant class, slave) trading places with prince (gentry, slavemaster) with wild costumes (German Belsnickle, African John Canoe, Boston-Philadelphia &quot;mumming&quot;), endorsed begging, whiskey-soaked revelry and feasting, bawdy songs, wanton sex, vandalism and violence equal parts Halloween and Mardi Gras. Nissenbaum successfully argues that this role reversal behavior was tolerated, even encouraged to reinforce traditional class roles.<br />Nissenbaum builds his unsentimental holiday history between these pillars. He reinterprets beloved, seemingly eternal seasonal traditions (Dickens' &quot;Christmas Carol,&quot; decorated trees, St. Nicholas) as creations to refocus the celebration on temperance, home, and family (especially children). He links their manufacture and deliberate spread to 19th century revisionist views: abolition and the role of freed blacks, new child rearing and education theories. Nissenbaum redefines &quot;Twas The Night Before Christmas&quot; nearly line-by-line, showing the social satire within Clement Moore's detailed descriptions and figurative redrawing of the &quot;jolly old elf.&quot;  These intentionally benign images mask and spur attempts to link a consumer-driven society in a still-new nation with folk traditions generations old.<br />Nissenbaum saves his empathy and some of his most descriptive, humorous writing to chart contradictions and hyprocricies within holiday giving. Much like orphaned New York newsboys' food fighting over not getting holiday dessert first, he pokes the motivations behind gifts charitable (Ebeneezer Scrooge's symbolic Christmas turkey, slavemasters' gifts to field hands, Louisa May Alcott's reaction to a children's Christmas dinner, New York's well-to-do buying tickets to attend large charity dinners) and personal (charting the Sedgwick family's gift giving history with problems close to our modern Christmas.)  Nissenbaum's epilogue falters comparing antiquity's &quot;carnival&quot; Christmas with today's wild clothes and &quot;boom boxes.&quot; His modern parallels come too little, too late, yet his meticulous research and detached writing style form a more factual, critical account than Karol Ann Marling's 2000 &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot; (I still prefer that book for its sentimentality, broad scope and author's personal reflections. Marling cited &quot;Battle&quot; as influencing her work).<br />Nissenbaum acknowledged &quot;my muse, and my darling&quot; Dona Brown because &quot;she made sure I used the writing of this book as a way to exploring my own sense of what it means to be Jewish.&quot; This is worth mentioning because Nissenbaum concludes that &quot;today we wish for a past that has no past&quot; and &quot;there was never a time when Christmas existed ...immune to the taint of commercialism.&quot; His statement conflicts with the greatest hit of a Jewish songwriter, Irving Berlin, who made millions worldwide wistful for a Christmas &quot;just like the ones I used to know.&quot; Both men understood how distant, near non-existant that idealized Christmas wish was, but the difference between successful composer and truthful, scholarly author lied in reaction and perpetuation. With due respect to the author's heritage and religious faith, anyone wanting &quot;Christ back in Christmas&quot; or the &quot;reason forthe season&quot; returned should read this deeply researched, highly recommended history.r the season&quot; returned should read this deeply researched, highly recommended history.	2001-03-19

In &quot;Wait 'Till Next Year,&quot; what to Lupica was a daily generational journal becomes a bittersweet coming-of-age story to writer/historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.<br />Goodwin wraps her memoir around her family's shared love of the Brooklyn Dodgers: years of dissapointment (including 1951's infamous playoff loss to the New York Giants) to their 1955 championship season (recalled sweetly and vividly as the neighborhood celebration it was), and their treasonous 1958 move to Los Angeles. Goodwin grows to know and love the game, learning statistics, meeting legendary ballplayers like Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, and Jackie Robinson, sharing her passion for the game with friends and family.<br />Goodwin's story rings more powerful for its evocation, wistfulness, and sweeping sadness. She details the human face to the classic 1950s family image: successful, loving father, doting mother, precocious children, friendly (and cantankerous) neighbors, friends, shopkeepers. She shares the summer warmth of Jones Beach, nights at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field or by the radio with Red Barber, Sundays in church loving and learning her Catholicism.(not to mention schooldays listening to the World Series, which we may never see again). Security rested in tradition: the Dodgers' starting nine, clear answers to her Cathecism, friends and family there for her and each other.<br />The young Goodwin dreams and believes greater things, enabled by parents allowing her self-expression and growth unusual for young girls then. Her vivid imagination wins a Dodger pennant by breaking the limbs of players on rival teams, her cajoling saves the Dodgers for Brooklyn, her care helps a potentially polio-stricken boyfriend, her beauty and wiles win Rhett Butler and allow her to read every book in her public library. Throughout, Goodwin also feels the requisite Catholic guilt; her confession after attending a Campanella speech strikes you with humor and pathos. (You wish you could know more about her love for the then-new rock and roll, and how that differentiated her and her friends from their parents.)<br />The 1950s' seismic events (Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's treason, the McCarthy hearings and her friends' eerie re-creations of them, the 1956 Arkansas school integration, Sputnik) erode her security and faith. But in Chapter Seven, Goodwin chronicles losing what she valued most: friends and a team who moved, her mother dying in her sleep, her beloved home. These permanent changes left her and her father, who endured loss throughout his life, grieving but stronger for their shared experience. (Goodwin's descriptions of her mother were particularly moving; like her, my mother was sickly, had endured loss in her past, loved to read books and passed away at an early age.)<br />The book's title refers to the Dodgers' end-of-season mantra after years losing the World Series to the hated New York Yankees.  To Goodwin and her surviving family, it is also a slogan of resilience, that through preserving the past we keep those we love -- relatives, friends, heroes, neighborhoods, eras -- close. This is consistent with Goodwin's subsequent life and career choices, from her marriage and new love of the (equally heartbreaking) Boston Red Sox, to her passing baseball tradition to her children, to her becoming a full-time historian. In &quot;Wait Till Next Year,&quot; Doris Kearns Goodwin did in a meticulous, personal way what &quot;Forest Gump&quot; did as Hollywood spectatcle:  insert her life and aspirations into some of history's most important events.

In his introduction to the 1994 update, he accurately mentions that his book &quot;appeared on the cusp of the most important changes since the advent of rock and roll.&quot; He recalls the gradual fade of disco and punk styles and their meld into the raw, underproduced 1990s hip-hop and alternative rock.<br />That first &quot;Lists&quot; was quixotic, goring rock's sacred popular and critical cows while presenting chart statistics - as important to pop as to baseball fans -- as trivia under and around his sharp opinions. Moreover, Marsh's exhaustive knowledge and research exposed rock's lesser known masterpieces, having the effect of a recipe you had to try when you got home. The book re-established what made rock important to many.<br />By 1994, hip-hop and rap ruled charts, dominated fashions, entranced youth and alienated generations as R&amp;B and rock and roll did for Marsh's generation. But Marsh (who collaborated with &quot;Source&quot; magzzine editor James Bernard on this edition) could not take the breezy, sarcastic approach with this style; to treat the music less than seriously played into the hands of perceived racists and authoritarians wanting it and its young, black artists silenced (Marsh's intriguing &quot;enemies&quot; and &quot;fake friends&quot; lists provide one example.)<br />Whether Marsh and Herbert admit it (they don't here), rap's use as rhythm as melody sears the music from its tradition and fails to compare with from the bebop jazz Marsh points it to in his list &quot;Discredited Rock Theories.&quot; While some important musical statements used the form (one list links Grandmaster Flash's &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;White Lines&quot; to a Mel Brooks novelty rap), most music fans, black and white, felt betrayed by the lack of continuity. Bob Herbert of the (#10 enemy) New York Times pointed out this week that rap &quot;has so thoroughly broken faith with the surpassingly great, centuries-long tradition of black music in America. With rap, both the music and the poetry have vanished.&quot; Marsh and Herbert would strongly disagree, and the book suffers, rather than thrives, for that dichotomy.<br />&quot;The New Book Of Rock Lists&quot; will entertain rock or rap fans, but convert neither. The incongruence of the first book's hilarious lists play poorly against the later hip-hop updates. Chapters on &quot;Dancing,&quot; &quot;Criticism,&quot; &quot;Broadcasting&quot; (featuring sly Marsh commentary on today's radio scene), and above all, &quot;History&quot; try bridging gaps while revising the story (&quot;Print the legend, not the fact,&quot; the first book exclaimed). Seminal figures like Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and the Beatles each had chapters in the original version but now are tucked into larger chapters. The essential singles and LP lists from rock's first 25 years are sadly missed.<br />The book remains fun, teaching much to those willing to see pop music as seamlessly and meaningfully as Marsh has, wise and willing to connect folk and blues songs like &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; to a century's music and a people's history. The good news is that, regardless of music's standing by &quot;Lists&quot; third edition, it will be cohesive or disjointed and a better read in either case.y) New York Times pointed out this week that rap &quot;has so thoroughly broken faith with the surpassingly great, centuries-long tradition of black music in America.

The title of Lupica's 235-page screed hints that this is no nuanced look at personalities and philosophies shaping American sports' forced aristocracy.<br />It needed doing, but anger makes Lupica's pen a blunt instrument rather than the needed surgeon's scalpel. His points are broad, well-taken, hard-hitting. His rap sheet of players (the 1990s Dallas Cowboys, Christian Peter, Lawrence Phillips, Albert Belle) and owners (Art Modell, George Steinbrenner, Jerry Jones) ring twice as notorious one after another as among sidebars and corners of Lupica's New York Daily News.<br />But that is all Lupica seems to do - list, vent, take God's name in vain (so you know he means it ), conclude complex problems of objectification and race with obvious, flag-waving answers (don't park or buy hot dogs at the games, contact athlete endorsers when behavior's bad, create Sports Police to punish bad behavior). He builds evidential cases but fails at closing argument.<br />Lupica correctly points out the &quot;Best Available&quot; philosophy as the reason behind sports stars' inflated value, the power twist among player unions, agents, and owners (touching on President Clinton's attempt to end 1994's baseball strike)  contempt toward fans, women, opposition, media, authority in general, and the overhype celebrity, especially sports, has in society. (His &quot;dissing&quot; of future LA Lakers Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal are prophetic considering this year's feud after the Lakers' recent championship).<br />His comparing professional sports to New York's legendary Cotton Club (wealthy, mostly white people watch the best black performers) is superb, demanding more insight than the 12 pages given it. The examples from Lupica's life as reporter (a puzzling tale of two columns with basketball's Anthony Mason) and father (his children discussing sports cards' cash value, the ugly tale of a Dallas Cowboys' autograph show in New Jersey) brings this new, harsh athlete/fan relationship to familial bonds that sports should reinforce. (Lupica's later &quot;Summer of 98&quot; is a brighter look at how sports fandom can unite generations).<br />If America's sports fascination is the &quot;abusive relationship&quot; Lupica describes, if his point is accurate that &quot;(Fans) have to take (abuse) from sports, because there is nowhere else to go,&quot; than Lupica fails in not indicting America's celebrity-starved culture for misguided hero worship. Fact is, as world events from Olympics (Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan rate mention in a knock on the media!) to the Gulf War prove, America loves winners, fears losing, hates losers. Everybody, from taxpayers to politicans to sports networks give what they have, endure what they must to assure winning records in daily standings, weekly Neilsens, or corporate quarterlies. &quot;Fan&quot; after all, is short for &quot;fanatic,&quot; and fanatics have honored more than their share of false gods and scribes.<br />Lupica allows consumer advocate Ralph Nader to comment accurately about building what would become PSINet Stadium while Baltimore's schools crumbled. But he failed to express the city's heartbreak in the 14 years after their beloved Colts left for Indianapolis. That story, including the NFL thwarting its' attempts to regain an expansion team, could have been a metaphor for all that was wrong in sports and its importance to civic pride. (The late Robert Irsay rates no mention in the book while his team-swapping partner, the Rams' Georgia Frontiere, is dissed early and often.)<br />This book could use a update if Lupica has temper for it. Some among the villified (Modell, Steinbrenner, Frontiere) won titles or may soon do so.

The outcry, among the worst any Porter column generated, caused her to spend her next columns backpeddling from that assertion.<br />Christmas celebrated in its secular, sensory state is a perfect subject for cultural historian and author Karal Ann Marling to tackle. Her books on Elvis Presley, Disney architecture, and the TV-based 1950s culture dove deep in the sweet, shallow end of Americana. She successfully read us the instructions and mission statements behind history's garish, outlandish symbols and sounds, from tail fins to tinsel, seeing links and reasons deepening the meaning of a generation's shared memories.<br />It's no surprise, then, that &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; is Marling's most personal, well-researched and satisfying book yet. She writes as researcher, scholar, stubborn child (her epilogue on Christmas cookies is a delight, her closing a Santa Claus chapter by chastising &quot;Dear Abby&quot; surprising and funny), and lover of Christmas legends old, new, and rediscovered.<br />Except for a chapter on 1890s African-American Christmas celebrations (which text and illustrations are among the book's most intriguing chapters and merited such commentary) Marling resists the temptation to debunk or overanalyze her Christmas subjects. She writes with the knowledge, nostalgia, and joy of someone loving the season and wanting to share what she has learned.<br />Through 370 pages Marling sleigh rides across 150 years' Christmas history (or, better put, &quot;Her&quot;-story; Marling's version emphasizes women's creating and preserving holiday tradition). She explains and provides context for traditions like gift giving and wrapping, huge feasts, Christmas cards, holiday charity (with remarkable photos of a mass dinner for the poor in 1890s New York), department store parades and decorated windows,  Christmas plants and trees and glowing with candle or electric light. She also walks through the winter wonderland of Christmas heroes real and imagined: Scrooge, Bing Crosby, Grinch and of course, Santa Claus as described by Thomas Nast, Coca-Cola, and the dreams of generations of children worldwide.<br />Marling does nearly all of this through the distant eye of media: magazine articles covers (touching on Norman Rockwell and J.P. Leyendecker with Nast),TV and movie screens, (yearly specials and songs restoring Christmas' homey, familial warmth) children's books (long-neglected holiday tales from Washington Irving and L.Frank Baum -- Baum's a Santa biography! -  may get new attention after being described here). Even 100 years of department store Christmas windows (which Marling describes with delicious detail) show not only from behind a economic glass impenetrable to the poor, but from an idealized Christmas past few Americans enjoyed entirely.<br />That is Marling's point. If the night of the dear Savior's birth connects only dimly with America's celebration (a point Marling needed to cover sooner and harder)it may stem from Christ's birth being the most documentable story of the season. As Marling burrows through Clement Clark Moore poems and 19th century magazine stories through films like Crosby's &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;  and &quot;White Christmas,&quot; the seasons' backstory and memory bank grows and artificially glows until the Star of Bethlehem is outglowered by images of Chevy Chase and Liberace's garish Christmas decorations. The Nativity is one true, gritty, essential Christmas story surrounded by layers of fantasy.  Marling's paralleling Joan Crawford's public, radio-broadcast Christmas to her cruel, well-publicized private one, antidotes the more sugary memories here, as do quotes from J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot; and from Elvis Presley's &quot;notorious&quot; 1957 Christmas LP.<br />Those bemoaning the season's commercialism may find comfort and joy in &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot; Marling traces protests against the holiday's economic emphasis to the 1820s; since, everything from billboard campaigns to TV's &quot;Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Grinch&quot; to the rise in more personalized and religious Christmas cards have addressed that conflict. Those rejecting supplemental Christmas traditions entirely (from 1870s Puritan factories and schools open Christmas Day to Michael Jackson, profiled at Christmas in a magazine although he did not celebrate the holiday) will be disheartened by their growth and acceptance, and Marling's tacit approval.<br />No protest over purpose diminishes the quality and scope of Marling's work, among the most essential books ever written about the Christmas season.  Marling closes her prologue by saying, &quot;Incidentally, this book would make a good present for your mom!&quot; Matronly, perhaps, but I liked it too; like any good, factual story with a happy ending, &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; is as welcome a Christmas re-read as any Christmas tradition it charts.

Mundis' precepts are easy to understand if not swift to accomplish. He acknowledges this in writing, &quot;Anyone who has taken grade-school arithmatic or who can push the buttons on a simple calculator has all the technical mastery he needs to understand his personal money.&quot;<br />His steps: write each and every incoming and outgoing transaction into a weekly, then monthly account. Use those figures to create a budget to fit your lifestyle and repay your creditors, without hard-core sacrifice that only proves self-defeating. Know to the penny what you have, spend and owe. Do not debt, at all, just for today. Or, to quote Teddy Roosevelt, &quot;Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.&quot;<br />The most interesting sections concern psychological and social implications associated with and leading to problem debting, and how to overcome and prevent them. Mundis encourages figuring out creative ways to handle money emergencies other than with a credit card. He encourages meditation, visualization, planning future successes beyond momentary highs or relief credit seems to provide. He explains how to handle the collection agency, lawyer, courtroom.<br />To achieve this, he encourages creative list making, re-evaluation of supposedly nevessary material things (his section, &quot;Keel The Bool&quot; most notably here) or ideas that seemed zany. Most of all, he encourages dismissal of any emotions associated with money: it's no mood changer, nor love declaration when spent, nor sell-out to materialism and selfishness when saved.<br />His opening chapters, describing the types and warning signs of problem debting, were chillingly accurate and uncompromising. (&quot;And everybody bounces a check now and then, don't they? No. Most people without a debt problem hardly ever do.&quot;) Mundis writes with the compassion and reassurance of someone knowing the issues of problem debting. His three things to remember when debt worry becomes overwhelming are among the most useful worry defusers I have heard. Yet Mundis also speaks with the zeal of the recovered addict, knowing the road to and from disaster and letting no one cross or return. His personal stories and case studies from Debtors Anonymous (including that of the young woman who tearfully gave up her American Express card), are sweepingly sad.<br />Like all self-help books, &quot;How To Get Out Of Debt&quot; can only be judged successful if those reading it apply its precepts and achieve its promised conclusion. (Obviously, those for whom debting is not an issue probably do not read or review, these books.) Suffice it to say that Mundis has provided possible emotional and practical tools to achieve financial freedom, and has done so in re-readable, instructional style. Debtors Anonymous, quoted liberally as inspiration and support source, would do well to endorse this guide in its program.ple without a debt problem hardly ever do.&quot;) Mundis writes with the compassion and reassurance of someone knowing the issues of problem debting.

It semi-autobiographically describes Miller's vagabond life in 1930s Paris, blasting off from mundane conversations and cold sexual encounters into flying, flowing strands of poetic imagery and useful, if not always agreeable, wisdom glorifying the individual over any semblence of community.<br />Miller writes of dead-end jobs at a newspaper and boarding school (his entry about his proofreading job should be required reading for would-be newspapermen), fleeting, fleecing relationships with friends and acquaintances (Miller's betrayal at book's end, not only of his friend but of his disdain to material wealth, is revelatory) and the rooms, city, and country he lived in (his descriptions of dark Paris streets and bordellos,  their residents and patrons read sensual and grotesque, but hold humanity better than their scribe. His descriptions of New York skyscrapers are intriguing and surreal). His frank conversations among bedmates, liberal use of offensive words for women and minorities would easily fit on an Enimem rap album in 2000; imagine what audiences emerging from the Victorian era must have thought. Miller's sexual descriptions are even today too raw, mean-spirited and selfish to stand even as pornography.<br />But amid Miller's poetic, not narrative, wordflow (a vivid, hilarious description of a bar fight notwithstanding), &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; seems most to rankle vision and values Americans hold as close as their beloved eagle and flag symbols. (No accident that Miller gets evicted from job and living quarters on America's religious holiday, July 4). 40 years before punk's Sex Pistols mocked their countrymen by singing &quot;No future for you!&quot;, Miller joyously lived without having or wanting one. His world in &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; is without savings, family, hope, history, reverence, or respect. All this in years of the American and world's Great Depression; Miller's famous opening lines &quot;I have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive&quot; would cut America's &quot;Greatest Generation,&quot; which overcame that Depression, to the quick - had they read them then.<br />&quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;'s final, abrupt scenes are inevitable; Miller's friend's wish to leave his girlfriend for home &quot;to hear people speak English again&quot; countered all Miller acted on and wrote about. The end is as wholesome a climax as this most hedonistic story could have achieved, in a book fellow iconoclast Ezra Pound accurately described as &quot;a dirty book worth reading.&quot; In other words...Miller's Paris is a nice, if dirty, place to visit in print.

References to Nixon, the Reagans, and to candidate Gary Hart abound (the book also features an odd Oliver North analogy). He also name-checks notorious 80s figures like Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Jim Bakker, and even Lou Holtz. While some of Bing's many anonymous testimonials shock and surprise (especially one on an alcoholic boss with a surprise happy ending representing his best writing here) many seem like workplace whining from people you also would not wish to work with, let alone for.<br />Bing properly blames psychotic boss behavior and its effects (obsessive perfectionism, unfair preferences, inconsistent policies) on need for short-term profits, demand to create and chart corporate culture, sycophants who feed need and ego of the powerful (making converts along the way), which in turn exert it over those beneath by stealing time, thought, and morale. Bing delves into these areas with some humor but often unneeded commentaries after quotes that speak well on their own. Yet his comments on workaholism, which in his chapter &quot;Diaster Hunter&quot; he groups with alcoholism, drug abuse, and sexual harrassment, properly expose that trait for the character and family-breaking flaw it is.<br />Although Bing's recent &quot;What Would Machiavelli Do?&quot; seems to cover similar subject matter with more pointed humor, &quot;Crazy Bosses,&quot; with a 90s rewrite, could remain a useful reference to those needing instruction and reinforcement in the workplace. No employee, whether working for Ebeneezer Scrooge or Al Dunlap, is ever their job.

He could tell of Clark's ascension to the \\"Bandstand\\" podium at a strategic time, hooking Clark, his host network (ABC), and host city (Philadelphia) to pop culture prominence. Jackson could chronicle the city's fast-moving music scene, the teen singers, disc jockeys, and businessmen (Clark among them) who exploited the new music. Finally, he could tell the show's own 32-year story, as \\"Bandstand\\" led, followed, then rehashed youth culture.<br /><br />Despite factual errors (putting \\"All You Need Is Love\\" on \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" shows as much Beatle knowledge as Jackson claimed Clark had) and unneeded 60s-70s rehash, Jackson's biography adddresses its subjects accurately and engagingly. Jackson sees Clark not as money-grubbing villain but driven, opportunistic businessman who \\"within the bounds of propriety - followed the dollar wherever it took him.\\"<br /><br />Clark fought to cult!ivate, keep, and wield a pleasant national image to his advantage. Jackson succeeds most in showing how that image served, even saved Clark's career. Clark's soft-spoken, \\"nice guy\\" image eased the transition from the scandalous, tragic tenure of original \\"Bandstand\\" host Bob Horn. It softened and widened (some said, despite Clark's objections, \\"whitened\\") rock and roll's ease into daily life and the youth buying power enjoining it. Mostly, it masked the clear-eyed, hard-charging figure who not only stood up to federal regulators and network bosses, but parlayed his \\"Bandstand\\" success into music-related (torn by 1959-60's \\"payola\\" scandal, covered in depth here despite little Clark participation), then rebuilt into complete media-based success.<br /><br />Fans of early rock will enjoy Jackson's musical side trips. He looks at the \\"Bandstand\\" dancers' quick fame, the synergy and rivalry between the show, Philadelphia promoters, and disc jockeys, the rise of small record labels whi!ch (with Clark's involvement throughout) recorded national hits (Jackson tells fresh versions of the making of \\"At The Hop\\" and \\"The Twist\\"), and, finally, Clark's move to California which closed Philly music dominance (and, to believe Jackson, did little for \\"Bandstand,\\" either). Figures like musician Charlie Gracie, producer Tony Mammarella, and songwriters Kal Mann and Bernie Lowe, today unknown outside Philadelphia music, are remembered either as villain or victim. The last chapters, describing Clark's adjusting the \\"Bandstand\\" image to changing musical times, are among the book's most intriguing.<br /><br />The result makes \\"American Bandstand\\" unflinching, unfawning yet high-minded critique that Clark, generally no friend of critics, could support. The epilogue essays Clark's motivations, how he achieved and maintained fame and riches yet still promotes, produces, and hosts. Jackson concludes that it's what Clark enjoys doing and does best.

Simpson Got Away With Murder	Books	4	15	18	N	N	Bugliosi Re-prosecutes Simpson and More in &quot;Outrage&quot;	Crime prosecutor-turned-true-crime author Vincent Bugliosi slams the door on any debate of O.J. Simpson's guilt or innocence with this detailed critique of recent history's most celebrated trial and its participants. Writing with avenging anger, surgical precision, and evangelistic zeal(from a self-described agnostic, no less), Bugliosi describes the defense manipulation, proscution ineptitude, jury ignorance, media malice, and general hypnotism to celebrity collectively allowing a man Bugliosi saw as guilty man to walk free from a grisly murder.<br />Amidst unbending, unending criticism of lead prosecutors Marcia Clark and Chris Darden, Bugliosi shows with Monday morning quarterback clarity how he might have handled the case's key issues: opening and closing statements with their objections; evidence including the infamous suicide note, disguise and cash, blood found throughout Simpson's and his wife's car and home, the finger cut, the ill-fitting glove (which Bugliosi describes as a key turning point and one of Darden's errors, and how Bugliosi would have handled it), testimony from police scientists and detectives (including a lengthy semi-defense of the criminologists and the villified Mark Fuhrmann), and finally, racial and political tensions which to many underlined the jury's final, quickly-reached decision.<br />Also amidst the criticism, Bugliosi details the intense preparation going into preparing criminal prosecution. He discusses a closing statement needing constant revision,  witness interviews needing review (criticizing both sides there) addressing potential weaknesses before the opposition exploits them and that, but for time spent outside with children, a lawyer preparing a case should stay time only at office, courtroom, and home. This flies against Darden, Clark, and most notably Judge Lance Ito becoming media celebrities.<br />Bugliosi also uses the Simpson trial and verdict to comment on larger societal issues, from a chasm on racial matters (even among those supporting civil rights) to dealing with police brutality to, finally, questioning of God's role in human tragedies such as the Simpson murders.<br />Bugliosi's spiritual questions, somewhat disjointed from the book's otherwise hard-hitting style - are intriguing. You might understand his agnoticism: a man whose fame came proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt might have difficulty believing on faith alone. But his questioning of God's laws does not weigh equally with his full understanding of man's. His remark that &quot;No one, not even the tyrants of history, bad-mouths God&quot; ignores Church persecution throughout the last 1000 years, even Hitler's  remark that &quot;you cannot be a Nazi and a Christian.&quot; As Stevie Wonder so eloquently sung: &quot;Where is your God, that's what my friends ask me/And I say it's taken him so long, 'cause we've got so far to come.&quot;<br />Nonetheless, &quot;Outrage,&quot; despite needing a new chapter regarding what the prosecution did correctly in the wrongful death lawsuit a year later, represents the most authoritative, compelling retelling yet of the O.J.

He charts the myriad of programs that have appeared on broadcast networks (including those, like Dumont, which no longer exist), cable, and in syndication. His fun comes in praising the praiseworthy, trashing the deserving, goreing sacred Hollywood cows and keeping a critical expert's eye on  important pop culture strands and shifts.<br />&quot;Total Television&quot; is exhaustive, enjoyable, fun and fact-filled reading from any page it's read. McNeil generously shares facts, transporting you to time, channel, cast (sometimes literally in hundreds) and summaries of thousands of familiar and long-forgotten TV shows. TV's giants (from Walt Disney and Captain Kangaroo to Oprah Winfrey and &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;) receive their fair space, while McNeil also chronicles changes in TV daytime dramas, game, talk, and sports shows.<br />McNeil's consistent irreverence and historical perspective is remarkable. He salutes Walt Disney for creating TV's first mini-series (the wildly popular &quot;Davy Crockett&quot;) while also creating TV's first &quot;synergy&quot; (TV show promotes park and films, which promote movies and TV show).<br />McNeil also gives long-running, non-cult classics like &quot;Gunsmoke,&quot; &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot; their proper respect while chronicling the knotty, behind-the-scenes problems plaguing stars from Nat Cole to Judy Garland to Jerry Lewis to Sammy Davis, Jr., and the respective failures of their 50s-60s variety shows. (He recalls failed sitcoms like &quot;Family Dog&quot; and &quot;The Waverly Wonders&quot; with especially sweet relish). McNeil also features sections on landmark TV moments (which decrease in number and size from the mid-70s), full TV schedules, and Emmy winners.<br />This is NOT a book read cover to cover, even by diligent TV fans. Series' with same or similar titles, long paragraphs retelling old tales of Roseanne Barr and 1992's &quot;Tonight Show&quot; fiasco (in an otherwise fascinating entry on that TV staple) are redundant one after another.

She tours the 1950s' TV-raised images, from First Lady Mamie Eisenhower's  dress closet to her husband's paintings to garish car in the garage,  ready-made food in the kitchen, and herky-jerky TV images pointing to  changed American culture and aestetic. Hers is a more entertaining,  breezier read than recent books from, respectively, David Halberstam on the  1950s or historian Michael Kammen on American preference.(Marling shared  time at Cornell with Kammen, thanking his students in her acknowledgements  for &quot;challenging lunchtime conversation.&quot;)<br />Marling merges era  icons, fads, and seminal events more seamlessly into social statement than  Halberstam did or Kammen  attempted. Her understanding of cars evolving  into social statements segues best into the image of Elvis Presley, the  &quot;King of Rock and Roll&quot; for whom the &quot;gorp&quot;-covered  Cadillac was chariot of choice. (she also credits Martin and Lewis with  exposing the entertainment's dual sensibilities during early TV).<br />Marling  also writes of home convenience from new appliances and quick dinners  colliding with the rustic, more honorable life many felt had been replaced.  This clash inspired and popularized Grandma Moses' idealized portraits of  American country life, Walt Disney's scale model re-creation of small-town  America at Disneyland (and on the accompanying TV program), and Betty  Crocker's shorthand version of motherly mentoring through General Mills'  best-selling cookbook. Marling's chapter on Walt Disney's inspirations for  creating the park is among the book's most fascinating.

Brinkley nearly always closed the show with  an anecdote or thought-provoking, curmugeonly comments that, delivered with  trademark diction, trumped any cute animal story local news closed  with.<br />&quot;Everyone Is Entitled To My Opinion,&quot; collects these  short closers, reminding you that Brinkley's oratory gave fresh, common  sense drama to what reads now as classier shaggy-dog stories or whining.  The book has highlights, mainly Brinkley addressing his favorite topic of  government bureaucracy (cited in everything from $2500 Air Force pliers to  his dime tax bill). He praises junk mail (&quot;You never get bad news by  third-class&quot;) and global warming. He forgives President Bush for  getting ill in Tokyo after a whirlwind Pacific Rim tour and nominates  Richard Nixon for &quot;official US scapegoat.&quot; He also offers  touching eulogies for the Philadelphia Bulletin, Sam Ervin, and Benny  Goodman.<br />The book recalls the Reagan-Bush years with their heroes (the  presidents themselves, Margaret Thatcher) villains (John Sununu, Tip  O'Neill) and fools (James Watt, Leona Helmsley, Jim Bakker, Imelda Marcos).  This book is best enjoyed in its audio format; otherwise, check out  Brinkley's autobiography or 1989's excellent &quot;Washington Goes To  War&quot; for the best writing from this American news icon.	2000-08-22

This has resulted in gradual homogonization,  &quot;dumbing  down&quot; of all art forms.<br />In &quot;Red Lobster..&quot; Kammen's  cultural famine becomes columnist Joe Queenan's acerbic Admiral's feast.  Queenan, former Philadelphian and TV Guide employee (like yours truly), not  to mention self-professed highbrow, searched Broadway to Branson, Paris to  Cleveland for the pandering, crass, and schmaltzy in books, film, food,  theater, and TV. His is a fun, fast read with handfuls of name checks,  infuriating depending on how much your preferences clash with Queenan's  often sneering opinions.<br />Queenan saves special criticism for the  overwritten books of Deepak Chopra and Robert James Waller, overcooked  meals at TGI Fridays and Taco Bell, overwrought music of AC giants John  Tesh, Billy Joel, and Kenny G (missing the horrid Bette Midler but praising  her former employee, Barry Manilow), and overdone sequels to movies that  shouldn't have had a I, let alone a II-VII. His most vicious vitriol is for  overproduced Broadway plays like &quot;Jeckyll &amp; Hyde&quot; and  &quot;Cats,&quot; (from which Queenan enters and exits his lowbrow  luau).<br />You'll disagree with Queenan, often and vocally. His opinions of  doo-wop music and the films of Mel Brooks miss the point and, for doo-wop  at least, are borderline racist. The same for his views of Branson except  for Andy Williams (who receives Queenan's highest praise: &quot;no schmaltz  whatsoever&quot;). But &quot;Red Lobster&quot; remains entertaining  regardless of your entertainment choices; his takes on live audience  reactions, and his praise of older performers, may have you asking,  &quot;Why did I like...?&quot; He won't change your mind, but despite  offensive language and annoying prose style, he will have you using it.

He recalls, charts, and deconstructs lines of  &quot;high,&quot; &quot;low,&quot; and &quot;middlebrow&quot; taste  (defined over time by everything from furniture choice to favorite  &quot;Simpsons&quot; character). He also strengthens the divide between  &quot;popular&quot; culture (often regional and participatory) over  &quot;mass&quot; culture (homogoneous and sedentary), criticizing their  interchangability in American society.<br />Kammen doesn't adhere to timeline  (although he includes one to start the book) prefering to make points era  to era, country to city, weaving critical opinions often 50 years apart. He  cites the years 1880-1930 as when popular culture gained its footing (with  increased leisure time) and inspired some of its finest (often bristling)  national conversation from journalists such as Walter Lippmann. He finds  unique angles in cultural hegemony (sports equipment and rule books, Walt  Disney's and Charlie Chaplin's films, radio's &quot;Amos n'Andy&quot;, and  syndicated newspaper features all preceding television's ultimate  conquest). Then again, Kammen also includes Timothy O'Leary's dimbulb quote  that the Nintendo phenomenon is &quot;about equal to that of the Gutenberg  printing press.&quot; Uh huh.<br />Kammen reveals, then bemoans, the gradual  shift from active to passive, social to private amusement, from reliance on  cultural leadership (&quot;tastemakers&quot;) to public opinion easily  manipulated by advertising and slavishly served by mass media. Kammen also  praises disparate artists like Andy Warhol and Ken Burns for their fresh,  interpretive approaches to popular art, history, and their ultimate meld,  acknowledging criticism of Burns in a chapter among the book's  best.<br />Kammen writes like a professor: dryly, relying on self-reference  and prepositional pile-up (ending Chapter 8, for example, with a huge  excerpt from social critic Morag Shiach followed by his own terse, &quot;I  concur.&quot; Yet the sheer weight of his research, opinion collected and  examples rendered make &quot;American Culture&quot; a fine companion piece  to studying American fad, fashion, and leisure preference, a part of daily  American life few scholars have seriously studied.

It's fitting,  then, that Dole compile and narrarate &quot;Great Political Wit,&quot; a  collection of his observations with those of political figures from the  last 100 years.<br />You wouldn't anticipate a joke book based on the table of  contents, which features chapters on &quot;War,&quot; &quot;The  Economy,&quot; &quot;Religion&quot; and that political rib-tickler,  &quot;Defeat.&quot; But Dole's remembrances and selected stories succeed in  showing the lighter side of often somber figures (the Kennnedys, the  Roosevelts, especially Winston Churchill), making their humor seem almost  contemporary. Dole also recalls wit and wisdom from often-overlooked  figures like president Calvin Coolidge and candidates Huey Long and Adlai  Stevenson (whose retort to minister Norman Vincent Peale shows the power of  positive punning).<br />The book also shows the reasons behind political  humor: not always for laughs but persuasion, consensus, even attack.  President Reagan, who Dole praises for showing &quot;that not all  conservatives have embalming fluid flowing in their veins,&quot; gets Don  Rickles-sized barbs off at his 1980 opponent, Jimmy Carter. Dole even  recalls touching stories about history's more tragic figures: Richard  Nixon, George McGovern, Herbert Hoover, even Nelson Rockefeller.<br />None of  &quot;Great Political Wit&quot; is side-splittingly funny, although nearly  every quote will elicit a mild chuckle or nod of recognition.  (Surprisingly, Dole devotes a chapter to Jay Leno and David Letterman's  political barbs while leaving out even sharper political humorists like  Mark Russell and Mort Sahl). Nonetheless, &quot;Great Political Wit&quot;  is a breezy, lighthearted look at politics and the chracters inhabiliting  it.&quot;Great Political Wit&quot;  is a breezy, lighthearted look at politics and the chracters inhabiliting  it.	2000-08-08

Lupica writes as  father and son, journalist and fan while weaving the season's top stories  (Kerry Wood; the New York Yankees and stars David Wells and Darryl  Strawberry, most notably the Sammy Sosa-Mark McGwire chase of Roger Maris'  home run record) into a seamless, personal account.<br />As McGwire chases  Maris, then as Sosa chases McGwire, Lupica feels their impact most through  his sons (for whom he updates the games with notes by their bedsides) and  dad (who shared the Roger Maris chase of Babe Ruth when Lupica was nine).  It's a refreshing, reassuring story: posters, cards and uniforms decorating  a kid's room; the first day of Little League; dad taking kids to baseball  games or watching them late on TV, then the chatter at the breakfast table  before school; the reaction to McGwire's 62nd homer traveling from son to  father back to sons. Despite occassional corny prose, Lupica succeeds by  casting the story not in a mythical Iowa cornfield but in the lives of  those who saw respite in these successes: a rest from the Clinton-Lewinsky  scandal, from the cynicism and avarice  grown over sports, especially  baseball, like Wrigley Field ivy.<br />Lupica also draws the game's legends  back into his narratives. Strawberry and the legendary Joe DiMaggio battle  life-threatening illnesses (DiMaggio's two appearances at Yankee Stadium  that year provide touching bookends to the story; Strawberry's travails  here are made more notable by his recent relapses.) Orlando Hernandez  shares a private, then public moment with his daughters as the Yankees  march through the playoffs. Tony Gwynn takes his son to the monuments at  Yankee Stadium where Lupica took his father. It adds up to what Lupica  calls &quot;a love inside a greater love&quot; where news unites and bonds,  not divides, generations.<br />This story could only have been told about  winners; it is thus a story Lupica's sardonic, brilliant ESPN colleague,  Bill Conlin, could not have written. &quot;Summer of 98&quot; succeeds  because ALL its characters are heroes: managers, old players, new players,  fathers and sons (and Lupica praises the &quot;baseball moms&quot; too).  Like any championship effort, everything had to go right to win.

Rather, Frum clearly presents the events, trends, and  legacy in the 15 years preceding Ronald Reagan's election, subtly providing  reasoning behind Reagan's landslide victories.<br />Frum presents his  arguments skillfully, if with conservative bent. He describes 10 years of  self-indulgence, explaining the Me decade in dress, food, music, and home,  with humorous to devastating results in family, societal and even religious  life. He explains the birth and growth of the urban underclass and the  subsequent crime (non-violent and otherwise), drug abuse, and hopelessness  it fostered. He describes a governmental system made Byzantine by layers of  committees, recalling a forgotten 70s name (Wilbur Mills) as its architect.  Most sadly, he describes a judicial system, once bold enough to write the  legendary &quot;Brown&quot; decision, arrogantly creating laws for others  its members need to obey themselves, with violent, devastating results (The  Boston busing chapter is one of Frum's best, and saddest).<br />Frum also  shows the deeper truth behind the 70s unforgettable symbols. Behind  President Ford's &quot;WIN&quot; button lied 15 years of intentional  financial manipulation by his predecessors. Behind John Travolta's infamous  white three-piece suit lied an objectification in how men and women saw  each other, the result being infamous rises in day care, single motherhood  and divorce. Behind the music and costumes of the Village People, the dance  floor of Studio 54, and the infamous first scenes of &quot;Rocky Horror  Picture Show&quot; lied a new, brazen promiscuity in gay and straight  lifestyles.<br />Anyone remembering their history knows the story's villains,  heroes, and clowns: Jimmy Carter is honest but weak, filled with wrong  ideas. Gerald Ford is a healer with good ideas being foiled by his  Congress. Richard Nixon is devious but no more than his predecessors, while  Ted Kennedy and George McGovern becomes icons for unbridled liberalism.  Frum's right-wing bent (seen by positive reviews from Peggy Noonan and  William Buckley) does not diminish the truth of his research or his drawn  conclusions. Thankfully, he points to the rise of Apple Computers and the  stock market as the seeds of 90s prosperity.<br />You wish for more. This  refreshing approach might have invigorated the retelling of the American  Bicentennial, the death of Elvis Presley, the all-too-short papacy of John  Paul I and the first steps of his successor, the weekly social commentary  of &quot;All In The Family,&quot; and the beginnings and first responses to  the Reagan 1980 campaign.

Black players and their respective teams' treatment of them provided the drama in  &quot;October 1964,&quot; and the seismic &quot;Brown&quot; decision and  its aftermath inspired some of the finest chapters in &quot;The  Fifties.&quot;<br />&quot;The Children&quot; finds Halberstam focusing  completely (more than 80 chapters over 700 pages) to the lives and deeds of  young college students who broke the back of Deep South segregation.  Drawing on a novelist's drama and a reporter's detail (Halberstam covered  those first Nashville sit-ins) he creates a near-Biblical (in quality and  length) liberation story.<br />Comparisons to dramatic Biblical episodes  abound in &quot;The Children.&quot; Compare leader Jim Lawson's  meeting  with Dr. King to Moses' being commanded to lead his people from Egypt.  Compare Jesus' choosing of his first disciples to Lawson, who brought and  taught young men and women, black and white, to nonviolently integrate the  South's lunch counters, interstate buses, and finally their voting booths.  Compare Paul and Silas' prison terms with those the students suffered in  legendary prisons like Mississippi's Parchman Farm.<br />The analogy extends  to personalities, where Halberstam does some of his finest, fairest  writing. Compare the most violent Biblical villains to Halberstam's  Southern Goliaths: sheriffs Bull Connor and Jim Clark, newspaper editor  Jimmy Stahlman. Compare the bombastic, emotional apostle Peter to Jim  Bevel, the rock-steady Martha to activist Diane Nash, the money-grubbing  Judas to the fall of Washington mayor Marion Barry. The story has its  prodigals also, from a federal government moving from silent aggravation to  active protection of &quot;the Movement,&quot; to even the Vanderbilt  college president who repented of releasing Lawson from divinity school.  Unlike TV reporting of the movement, which covered its characters as noble  heroes opposing violent cartoon buffoons, Halberstam equally chronicles the  reasons and motivations of his story's heroes and villains.<br />The book (and  Movement's) climax comes with the  Voting Rights Act signed by President  Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The story then fractures between accounts of a  fraying movement after King's death to members personal lives, with less  dramatic effect. Some live in near-poverty (Nash) or make fortunes (Hank  Thomas). Some lead congregations (Lawson) or go to prison for their own  misdoings(Barry). Some marry and lead satisfied, if not completely happy  lives (Curtis Murphy) or question their sexuality and reach a reasonable  balance (Rodney Powell). But, as many do, they compare relatively mundane  lives with the exciting accomplishments of youth, with a collective  &quot;Now what?&quot; for a response.<br />Overall, &quot;The Children&quot;  despite occasional redundancy and lyrical flab, remains an essential look  at an often overlooked part of American history. Anyone questioning the  usefulness of voting, or why they should register, MUST read the middle  portion (Book II) of &quot;The Children.&quot;of the movement, which covered its characters as noble  heroes opposing violent cartoon buffoons, Halberstam equally chronicles the  reasons and motivations of his story's heroes and villains.<br />The book (and  Movement's) climax comes with the  Voting Rights Act signed by President  Lyndon Johnson in 1965.

What seemed to many a peaceful decade lit the fuse for Sixties rage and revolution.<br />Many of the Sixties' major issues and catalysts dress rehearsed the previous decade, and Halberstam dedicates chapters to them. He addresses the sexual and feminist revolutions through detailed studies of the &quot;Kinsey Report,&quot; the evolution of birth control, and circumstances leading to the Playboy magazine and Betty Freidan's &quot;Feminist Mystique.&quot; The push for civil rights takes its stand in 1954's &quot;Brown&quot; decision, the 1956 bus boycott and, finally, the school desegration at Little Rock, all among the book's most well-written chapters.<br />Halberstam wisely weaves the political stories of the decade throughout the narrative, letting the reader breathe with interesting, more familiar stories from the arts (Tennessee Williams, Ricky Nelson, Marlon Brando, James Dean and, of course, Elvis Presley). It addresses the rise of new types of businesses from the ground-level (Holiday Inn, Korvettes, McDonald's) to the top and beyond. General Motors is coronated with deeply researched chapters on its car design, advertising, and competition before their 50s story ends with the failed Corvair.<br />Heroes and villains switch sides often. Robert Oppenheimer begins as hero whose nuclear research helped win WWII; he ends without job or honor in a Communist-hunting political maelstrom. Joe McCarthy begins as a patriot attacking Communist influence in government, and ends drunken and disgraced. Game show star Charles Van Doren begins as one of TV's first and most admired stars, and ends in obscurity amid one of its most-remembered scandals. Arkansas governor Orval Faubus begins as a centrist bringing blacks more fully into daily life, ending as a model of bigotry and political expediency. Only Dwight Eisenhower, president for most of the 1950s, keeps some of the prestige and honor he entered office with even as his cabinet and government seemed to do some of its finest, also most sinister, work around (sometimes without) him.<br />A recurring theme throughout the book finds new technologies and higher standards of living crashing against traditional, long-held American ideals. The rise of new appliances, housing, cars, places to go, and things to do conflict with people's need for self-expression and creativity, also to work ethic. Much of Halberstam's chapter on &quot;The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit&quot; addresses this conflict; those exploiting it (from publisher Hugh Hefner to scientist Werner von Braun to &quot;Peyton Place&quot; author Grace Metalious) were celebrated then and, to a lesser degree, now.<br />Halberstam leaves much unsaid even after 733 pages and 46 chapters. Nothing about the Dodgers and Giants baseball teams' moves to California, a seismic event in a sport then still America's pastime. Nothing about Frank Sinatra's years at Capitol Records (music generally regarded as art). Nothing about the election of Pope John XXIII, the rise of Billy Graham, or much about any religious figure except Dr. Martin Luther King. (The many anti-Catholic, anti-religious opinions quoted in &quot;The Fifties&quot; may reveal bias on its author's part; I hope not.)<br />Nonetheless, &quot;The Fifties&quot; remains one of the finer historical overviews available about that decade.

(the talking donkey, Elijah's besting of Baal, Jesus and Zaccheus,  etc.) It tells the book's most spectacular stories (the parting of the Red  Sea, Jesus' walking on water) with simply expressed awe that should impress  children hearing it the first time. God's love and power is always written  into the final line of each story, things as reassuring to children as a  parent's goodnight kiss. (&quot;God had saved his people again!&quot;  &quot;Mary loved Him, Joseph loved Him, and God loved Him.&quot;)<br />The New  Testament portion emphasizes Jesus' parables and miracles, and tells  Christianity's most moving stories (Judas' betrayal, the Revelation) with  tact few religious writers would attempt.

(Fern, the Arables' daughter who saves Wilbur's life at the  start, retreats from the storyline as her interest shifts from animals to  boys.)<br />All this is told amidst word backgrounds of warm summer days,  dank cellars, midways filled with discarded food and paper, cellar barns  filled by scents of straw, manure, and slops. (Who but White could've  described the leftovers fed to Wilbur and actually make them sound  delicious?)<br />White's gift for character also shows most interestingly in  the rat Templeton, who many may identify with. Tough, clever, self-serving,  defensive, but valiant in the end, he adds much needed sour spike to  essential scenes that may have otherwise been too sweet (his negotiation  with Wilbur over Charlotte's egg sac is one example) Templeton's  self-desciption at book's end of &quot;living for the pleasures of the  feast,&quot; summarize in a way what makes life and what we do for each  other in it worth the trouble. Essential reading for children and adults.	2000-04-03

It is at  times inspiring (interesting sections on when good virtues turn bad and on  deadliest sins), at times impractical (one hour of reading for one hour of  TV viewing? Binoculars made from toilet paper tubes as a kids' toy?) and  even saccharine (We're supposed to use our TV time to snuggle and rub  backs!  I cringed when I read that line.) But then again, much here will  admonish, console, and refresh and mostly, remind you of what we ought to  do but often don't remember to. A good gift for those who enjoy Christy  Lane, &quot;Touched By An Angel,&quot; and all wholesome things - or need  to.	2000-01-31
