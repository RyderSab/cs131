It took over the headlines in the late 80s with a horrifying tale of racism and abuse, with accusations against influential and senior law enforcement officials.  In the end, it turned out that Tawana had lied about everything-- but the damage was done.  This fascinating step by step account by the reporters who did the work to get to the bottom of the tangled story Tawana spun is still riveting today-- and the exploitation of her symbolic value by Black leaders (especially Al Sharpton) and the press is reminiscent of subsequent cases (OJ's, for example) that dominated months of news coverage.  Track this down: truth is always more improbable than fiction, and this book proves it.	2005-10-13

Kinderman, is un unbelievably cliched parody of a character, alternately spouting the worst kind of hackneyed Jewish schtick and prosing on about deeply philosophical and theological piffle.  The book only begins to take off halfway through and then revs up to a confused denoument that doesn't satisfy.  SOMEONE should have helped Blatty to remove chunks of Kinderman's alternately hopelessly adorable banter and (supposedly) intellectually weighty lectures on evolution and existence and God and death and meaning and everything... couldn't somebody have told Blatty that he'd veered into self-parody already??<br /><br />I liked \\"The Exorcist.\\"  This sequel is a diminished return, adding nothing of substance to the first book.

Readers of Psmith's previous adventures (Mike and Psmith, Psmith in the City) will appreciate Psmith's adventures in darkest New York.  Wodehouse limbers up his dese, dems, and doses as he introduces us to \\"Bat\\" Jarvis and his gang of lowlifes, with whom Psmith interacts in an amusing manner-- even, at times, becoming strenuous in his defense of justice and his own corpus!  Psmith bonking miscreants over the head with a stick?  Yes!  Psmith disarming pistol-wielding evil-doers?  Yes!  And along the way, much of the artful and absurdly witty banter that Psmith and Wodehouse specialize in is served up in heaping dollops.  Enjoy!	2005-09-28

But a close study of these bite-sized descriptions of alternate realities is stimulating, and you'll be amused at the cross-referenced sicknesses that dot the book-- the editors are nothing if not attentive to detail.

He wrote the best mysteries, bar none, ever written: the Nero Wolfe series.  They crackle with wit and originality, and the plots are beautiful little puzzle-boxes of logic.  What Wodehouse was to the comic novel, Stout was to the mystery. <br /> <br />Stout himself felt that his best-plotted novel was this one.  Featuring Tecumseh Fox, it's longer than most of the Nero Wolfes, and (for me, anyway), not as much fun by a long shot.  It's still enjoyable, but should not be put before the dozens of novels and short stories featuring that \\"mere genius\\" Wolfe. <br /> <br />I won't be rereading this one-- but look forward to the passage of a decade so I can begin rereading all the Wolfe canon with a fresh palate....	2005-09-20

This episode is out of the ordinary.  Usually, as Travis takes on one of his \\"salvage\\" operations, he's mostly a private eye poking into a mystery that demands, once or twice, that he face a violent confrontation.   <br /> <br />\\"The Green Ripper\\" is instead a novel of revenge and combat, and a very satisfying one.  McGee functions more as the violent hero of a thriller in this one, and he makes an estimable hero.  The book is one of his final exploits, and the McGee of this novel (and of the final book, \\"The Lonely Silver Rain\\"), is more melancholy and brooding than the more upbeat Travis of the early novels.  Here, it fits: McGee wants nothing but revenge, and finds it. <br /> <br />My recommendation is to read the McGee books in order.  They're worth savoring, one every few months.  By the time you reach \\"The Green Ripper,\\" you'll appreciate the contrast of this novel's plot.	2005-09-20

Even so, the book is still a goldmine of THEORY about how to think about TV: why we watch, what we're seeking when we turn on the tube.  Yes, there's some academic jargon, but it's generally a clear and concise look at the dominant medium of our age.  He dissects several popular shows and really gets inside the box.  There's a little of everything here: history, theory, criticism, sociology.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand TV instead of just watching it.	2005-09-20

But \\"Excavation\\" is a wet firecracker of a book that seems to have been written for pre-adolescents.  Poorly characterized and predictably plotted, it reads like an \\"ABC After School Special\\" version of an Indian Jones movie. <br /> <br />Oddly, Rex Stout wrote this book (or something almost exactly like it) about 80 years ago and called it \\"Under The Andes.\\"  It's available online in its entirety if you don't believe me. <br /> <br />There are dozens of authors who do this thing better: Philip Jose Farmer, Jeff Long (\\"The Descent\\"), Talbot Mundy, H. Rider Haggard-- heck, read Lovecraft's \\"At The Mountains of Madness\\" for a ten-times-better look at an expedition seeking a lost civilization. <br /> <br />But skip this-- even if Rollins get a few things right in the first few hundred pages, actually spurring you to seek answers to several interesting plot developments, he throws it all away in the last few hundred with cliched writing and a surpriseless denouement.

Right off the bat, let's agree that Doc Savage novels (novelettes, really) are never going to be hailed as great literature.  But let's also agree that they're right at the acme of pulp fiction from the 30s: rousingly written, full of whiz-bang miracle science and acts of almost insane courage by Doc and his crew, they're the very BEST quality of chewing gum for the mind.  And here we have, in one volume, BOTH of the books in which Doc's nemesis, John Sunlight, appears.  John Sunlight!  A fiend in human shape!  Yang to Doc's Yin!  Evil where Doc is Good!!  Sherlock Holmes has Dr. Moriarty, Superman has Luthor, Charlie Brown has Lucy, and Doc Savage has John Sunlight.

This book is a collection of stills from the video.  As such, I can't comment on the book-- though I can't imagine it's anything like a substitute for the film, which is a masterpiece of completely original kitsch insanity.  Baldwin works with footage he's liberated from Mexican horror films and grade-Z documentaries and fuzzy newsreel footage and creates an alternative history of the past and future.  If you're a conspiracy buff and know anything about Latin American history, it's a gold-mine of kooky almost-real events and people.  Baldwin mines the paranoid byways of the crankiest of cranks to come up with a compellingly bizarre look at our Hollow Earth and its combination of rule by CIA mind-controllers and aliens in subjugation to Quetzalcoatl.  It's all true!!!  Well, maybe not-- but Baldwin nearly hypnotizes you into believing it all with a weird narration and a non-stop succession of surreal imagery that is cheesily magnetic.  For best result: put this tape on at low volume in the corner of a party and watch as soon everyone is huddled around the screen wondering WHAT IN HELL it is!   In short, if you can find a copy of the video-- GRAB IT!	2005-09-19

Farmer likes to shock,and several of his novels-- this one and \\"Image of The Beast\\"-- are his paean to extreme violence and sex in a pulp-fiction setting.  If you're open-minded, though, you'll really enjoy this (slightly twisted) Tarzan/Doc Savage story ripped from the deepest recesses of Farmer's id.  A familiarity with the two characters is recommedned, though not necessary-- Farmer wrote bios of both Doc Savage and Tarzan, and clearly loves them dearly.  This novel is an exorcism of all the repression in those novels: does Doc EVER get laid??  No!  And though Tarzan kills scores, hundreds of enemies in his novels, is he ever depicted as revelling in his happy homicide??  NO!  Here we get to see the dark and nasty sides of our heroes, and Farmer clearly loved writing about their most sexual and sadistic exploits. <br /> <br />Most people will go along for the ride and enjoy Farmer's prank-- but a few will blush a deep crimson and take offense.  By now, you know which camp you're in, surely....	2005-09-19

The writing is smooth and the situations are generally believable, though modern readers will have to forgive Buchan for some racist sentiments completely common at the time.  Both black and white characters are compellingly and sympathetically drawn, though, so there's no reason to apologize for the book.

I read all the biggies many years ago but couldn't find this at the time, and I've just now finished it.  It's full of ideas, as are all Dick's novels, and worthy of much study and thought.  Yes, it's an \\"aliens attack and attempt to subdue Earth\\" novel, but it's atypical (and superior) due to Dick's odd and unique worldview.  What a pleasure to enter his brain again-- all of his quirks are on view, with his enjoyable neologisms and snuff-taking and port-drinking protagonists fully engaged in a completely unpredictable plot.  If you're a Dick fan, you've been here before and will enjoy the ride.  If you're new to PKD, try it and see.  You'll want to read more, as much to ty to figure out what made the author tick as to savor the intricate and neurotic works he wrote over the years.  Dick was a singularity, often imitated and mocked, but ultimately a set of one.  \\"The Ganymede Takeover\\" is a good read-- not first-class Dick, perhaps, but five-star SF.   <br /> <br />PS: some of this is a bit un-PC, but sophisticated readers will have no problem with the racial stereotypes.	2005-07-19

This is worth buying for the first 2/3s of the book: older material from MAD that totally eviscerates the daily comic strips with great precision and affection.  The parodies of Little Orphan Annie and Maggie and Jiggs (with truly disturbing work from Krigstein), Mandrake the Magician, Popeye, Katzenjammer Kids, Gasoline Alley, and others are priceless work from Wally Wood and Bill Elder and several others-- some of the best and funniest stuff that's ever been in MAD.  But everything after the color section in the middle is almost completely expendable: newer material that mocks newer daily strips that don't merit the attention.  I mean really: is it worth making fun of Garfield? BC? Beetle Bailey? The Family Circus?  The older material works because the strips from the 20s to the 50s had identities forged over decades, with vast readerships.  The newer strips are pale imitations of the old chestnuts, and the MAD parodies and one-panel gags are likewise lukewarm. <br /> <br />So: buy this for the sterling stuff from MAD's first ten years, but skip the unworthy last 40 pages, a sad mockery of what's become the most disposible page of the newspaper....	2005-07-08

Luckily, I have both volumes on my shelf, so I don't need to pick either up-- but volume one, used, for less than ten bucks on Amazon??  Get it!  This is a hysterically mordant look at dirty jokes by one of the sharpest and filthiest minds ever.  And volume one is easier to digest than volume two (which is more oriented to potty humor and perversion).  Check the prices for Vol. II on Amazon!  As you see, not cheap.  So: pick up Vol. I and see what the fuss is about-- you'll be pleasantly surprised at Legman's cranky takes on jokes in every category.  He was completely unique; you'll enjoy meeting him, despite his dyspeptic outlook and air of superiority (to everyone, including you).  The joke may be dead, but the body's buried here-- and it still looks funny.	2005-07-06

He's an assassin, a professional killer. It's a lot better than you'd think if you've placed the Matt Helm books in the \\"cheap pulp\\" bin or based your opinion on the Dean Martin movies (awful).  The books are VERY good, and this is the best place to start.  You'll want to read the others when you've finished this-- the \\"death of a citizen\\" is an ironic title, as you'll see.<br /><br />So you've read the Ian Flemings (James Bonds) and the John D. MacDonalds (Travis McGees) and wonder if there are any more good 60s spy/thriller series characters out there: here's Matt.  He's tough and nasty, and the prose is spare and gritty.  Enjoy!	2005-05-29

The canvas is not as broad as his big two-pounders (Aztec, Raptor, Journeyer, Aztec Autumn, and the inferior Spangle), but it's an easy-going ride all the way.  There's less overt sex and violence here, but that fits the milieu he's created here, frequently comic and elegiac.  I'm glad to see some used copies available-- it's pretty tough to find in general.  So buy it while it's here!	2005-04-29

Cain and David Goodis and Jim Thompson and Charles Williford and like the dark, tough-as-nails paperback original fiction of the forties and fifties, pick this up.  It's a postwar Frenchman's take on the dark underside of America, a place he'd never been-- so his imaginary America is even more corrupt than the stuff the Americans were writing.  It's sleazy \\"realism\\" (that is: fantasy), with all the teenaged girls panting nymphos and all the men racist pigs.  The jargon is just \\"off\\" enough to raise a smile (though the translation is probably fine-- I read it in English), and the behavior of our \\"hero\\"-- a black man passing as white named Lee-- is completely reprehensible.  He hates _everybody_.  Due to the odd nature of its authorship and its aspirations, this is an entertaining read: not necessarily a good novel, but an intriguing and entertaining one.	2005-04-08

Makes perfect sense: isn't communion just Jesus' followers drinking his blood?  With tongue in cheek, Eccarius exploits the concept pretty well, then wanders off into a confusing \\"noble anarchists vs. the Pope and his vampire legions\\" plot, draining any momentum he's built as surely as a parish priest drains an altarboy of B negative.

Unlike the others, this one takes place in the US, about 170 years ago.  Our protagonist gets involved in some unsavory business involving slavery and-- as with almost all Jennings novels-- a quest for revenge.  This isn't as kinky sexually as \\"Journeyer\\" or \\"Raptor\\" or \\"Spangle\\" or \\"Aztec\\" or \\"Aztec Autumn,\\" but his trademark violence is here in some abundance.  A good read, and as always with Jennings, it provides a closely-observed view of the era.  Worth tracking down!	2005-03-10

My copy of this great book is in a box somewhere, but I have a powerful hankerin' to read it again.  New edition, please!  This is the best distillation of Rucker's odd writing-- odd but wonderful.  He's almost never without his tongue thrust firmly in his cheek in these stories, but the scientific and mathematical principles he's dealing with are thoroughly discussed and dissected.  It's HARD to describe Rucker-- better to read some of his novels (Master of Space and Time, Wetware/Software/Freeware, The Sex Sphere, White Light, the Hollow Earth), all of which show a loose, easygoing style mixed with challenging theory-- kind of a cross between JD Salinger and Larry Niven.  (But better than that sounds...)  Anyway, Transreal! is a great collection of Rucker's short stories, many of which I remember well even 10 years later-- try out \\"The 57th Franz Kafka\\" and you'll see what I mean.  If you find a reasonably-priced copy of this, leap!	2005-03-09

They are: The Die Hard, The Blind Pig, Grootka, Hit on the House, Dead Man, Dead Folks, Man With an Axe, and La Donna Detroit.  (And his new Fang novel, No Man's Dog, is #10.)

So, read and enjoy, but ask yourself: did he really turn Victor Neuberg into a camel?  Could he become invisible as he claimed?  Did he copy down a book dictated to him by an Egyptian god?  You get to decide whether he's a reliable source....   <br /> <br />After you read this, you'll want a more objective view of the life of this remarkable man, and for that I'd turn to either John Symond's \\"The Geat Beast\\" (fair but credulous) or the much more recent \\"Do What Thou Wilt\\" by Lawrence Sutin-- an excellent, open-minded, reasonably skeptical look at Crowley's life and works.  No matter what you decide about Crowley (genius, prankster, or madman), these are all entertaining and worthwhile books. <br /> <br />But begin with this one, straight from the magus' mouth.	2004-11-09

If you love bad puns and obvious humor (as well as references to popular figures from the mid-eighties), read this.  If you're a big Jennings fan, you may wish to pick this up just to see what he was like when he was being \\"funny,\\" but you'd do better to read any of the above-mentioned novels.  Entertaining historical romance with plenty of sex, violence, revenge, and exacting historical detail was his true metier.	2004-10-25

Whatever you do, don't start with this one-- begin with \\"Talented Mr. Ripley\\" and move along chronologically-- then pick this up and read it (if you wish), as it fills in some neat little gaps in our understanding of Tom and his friends.

Disch's hero is all too much like we are, and when he begins to experience the mind-expanding effects of his &quot;therapy,&quot; we watch his shifting perceptions register the pleasures and horrors of the change.  His dry commentary on the other experimental subjects is by turns empathetic and dispassionate-- but always grimly fascinating.  Disch has created an SF framework for this cold meditation on mortality, but it transcends the genre.  The plot satisfies-- but it's the precise writing and the brittle and cynical philosophizing behind it that make this special.	2004-04-21

Now, with all of the hoopla over the release of Mel Gibson's &quot;The Passion of the Christ,&quot; this book is once again a good place to get a completely different view of Biblical times and the role of Jesus.  The story is riveting, the ideas provocative, and the denoument unforgettable.  Moorcock deserved all the awards he won for this one-- and it's well worth your time.	2004-02-27

(Last I checked, there were SIXTEEN books in the series.)  It introduces the &quot;Aces&quot; (advantageously-mutated humans) and the &quot;Jokers&quot; (disadvantageously-mutated humans) who live in New York in the last half of the 20th century.  After a catastrophic viral incident in 1946, the mutant &quot;wild cards&quot; respond in different ways to their fates, and the stories here are always entertaining.  Best for me is the first story by the irrepressible Howard Waldrop, in which he gets the ball rolling.  But all are excellent.  This is entertaining, well-written, and thought-provoking SF with pulp overtones (Martin tells us early of his love for the great comic book heroes), and you may find yourself working yourself through the many volumes with as much enthusiasm as me...	2004-02-18

So you'd be unwise to start here; I'd even say you could dispense with it altogether, as it's a weak ending to the story.  But it ties up some loose ends of the 20th century version of the clan-- Centaine, born with the century, and her son Shasa, and his four children, Sean, Garry, Isabella, and Michael. The story runs from 1969 to the late 70s, and is rife with minor anachronisms-- Smith wrote this in the early nineties and forgot that kids didn't have videos to pop in and watch back then, etc.  The plot is turgid romance and espionage, and the weakest book I've found from Smith-- start anywhere else but here. &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; is a solid adventure story, and will serve as an entree to the Courtneys, if you've a mind to get to know them....	2004-02-02

Why this is worth reading: if you wish to know about the sixties and the counterculture in NY and LA and SF, and if you want a (mostly unreliable but entertaining) eyewitness, this will inform and intrigue.

First, he does little to lay out reputable criticisms, picking and choosing those arguments he wishes to refute.  Then he goes to his experts, all of whom are (surprise!) Christian professors who destroy the straw argument, leaving us little choice but to agree that, indeed, Christ actually did this or that miracle.  As an example of rational argumentation, the book gets zero stars, though it's at times entertaining.  There's an excellent book waiting to be written on this topic.  This ain't it.	2003-09-19

These novels, mostly police procedurals, are concisely and wittily written, and as the books continue, we really get to know Fang Mulheisen and his city, Detroit.  Later, in books like \\"Hit on the House\\" and \\"Deadman,\\" we meet recurring characters such as likeable assassin Joe Service and his on-again off-again love interest (and Mafia princess) Helen Sedlacek.  These are \\"real\\" people with foibles and weaknesses-- some are unapologetic killers, but we get to know them and, yes, like them.  Fang tracks them down, and sometimes even catches them.

Of course, Stout fans (and I am one) love the brilliant Nero Wolfe novels with an irrational passion-- they're truly fine reading and seem just as fresh to day as when they were written 70 or 60 or 50 years ago. That said, this very early novel by Stout is a stolid attempt at a cliffhanger-- once the caverns under the Andes are reached, the narrative becomes repetitive as escape follows escape follows escape from the evil denizens of the deep.  Only true fans of Stout will be even remotely amused by this early work-- luckily, he learned a lot in the 20 years that followed this exercise, and the first Nero Wolfe was as good as the last.

It's as indispensible now as it was then, and deserves a close reading by all those engaged in a critical view of humanity. All of us are gullible to one degree or another-- the secret is to puncture unmerited beliefs as much as possible, before they grow into full-scale dogmas that one ends up hauling around like bags of bricks. Gardner's still amusing and informative evisceration of phony \\"scientific\\" theories still holds water, and you'll howl with delight at his witty skewering of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetics (later to become Scientology), Lawsonomy (Midwesterners in particular will enjoy this part-- there are still pockets of Alfred W. Lawson's heritage in Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, and elsewhere), the flat-earthers and hollow-earthers-- there are dozens of examples of endearingly wacko schools of thought that still boast adherents.

This is a flabbergastingly entertaining look at the history of spiritualism and the (mostly) lovable fakes and frauds who practiced it in its heyday.  Washington's scholarship is never dry and always informative, and he treats his sometimes wacky subjects with a kind of respect, even when they're behaving in a lunatic manner.  For those who like to see how new religions are born, you can't do better than this book (though \\"Bare-Faced Messiah\\" by Russell Miller, the story of L. Ron Hubbard and the rise of Scientology, is another winner in the same vein).  Madame Blavatsky and her cohort are worthy of your time-- this funny and sometimes bittersweet story (what happens when the new Messiah doesn't WANT to be the Messiah anymore?) will enthrall you.	2003-03-06

I wouldgive this five stars if it weren't for the fact that several of the invocatory protocols seem hopelessly flawed, resulting in the materialization of positively dangerous minor imps.

Having written several of the best of the best thrillers ever (Metzger's Dog, Butcher's Boy, the first two Jane Whitefields) and a number of almost-as-good standards (Big Fish, Island, Sleeping Dogs), this signals a reassuring return to form for his fans.  If you're unfamiliar with his work, this is a good place to start.  He's a pro with tightly-plotted, tersely-observed action, and a real pleasure to read.  Why these things haven't been made into films is a complete mystery to me-- at the very least I hope Perry's making money off a fist-full of Hollywood-optioned works to keep him concentrated on his next five books.  I look forward to reading every one.	2002-07-26

Enjoyable, but it becomes repetitive.  The four novels that preceded this one are better: 5 star reads.  And even better are the early Perrys, if you can track them down: Butcher's Boy, Metzger's Dog, Big Fish, and Island.  So, by all means read this one, but don't start here: go to the front of the line.	2002-05-15

Read This Book.	Wonderfully entertaining and enjoyable scholarship on extremely odd topics: flea circuses, hunger artists, nose-removal devices, and humbug of all sorts.  Jay proves himself once again to be not only a supremely talented performer on the stage but on the page as well.  Peruse this and be amazed at what people found entertaining a century or two ago... it's not so different from what you watch every evening on the TV (especially if you watch Fox).	2002-03-15

This novel allows us to enter the mind of Jake Holman and see the world (or a small part of it: China 80 years ago) through his eyes.  The book is deeply philosophical without being didactic or boring, exploring profound ethical issues in a fascinating way.  Make no mistake-- it's serious fiction, though not &quot;heavy&quot; or overly literary reading.  It's fine writing, an enthralling story, a classic novel.	2002-03-15

But Farmer is always thought-provoking, and I was pleased to have read this additional (and unquestionably final) chapter in the saga.  As Farmer so often does, here again he completely confounds expectations and reverses the &quot;truth&quot; of the previous books.  Philosophizing here as in all his other works, he tackles themes that flow through his entire oeuvre-- morality, immortality, free will, theology... there's little he misses along the way.  So, if the Riverworld series is your cup of tea, and the first four books pleased you, this is a solid bet-- don't miss it for the final pieces of the puzzle.	2001-12-27

Appel's annotations are judicious and informative-- he's a wit in his own right, and his love for Nabokov (a former professor) is evident.  This is the version to read-- Nabokov's genius and Appel's diligence meld nicely to enhance an already great work.	2001-11-27

But I'd be lying if I didn't say that the reason I love it most is that it makes me laugh-- on several occasions I laughed so hard that I woke up my wife, who was trying vainly to sleep next to me.  As Spinrad's sources tell about their own habits regarding their precious bodily fluids, it's impossible not to recognize how much we share in regards to these daily substances-- and impossible not to laugh at how we treat these taboos.	2001-07-26

I had long since given up on hoping for a fifth dispatch-- I'd worn out the first four (and ordered dozens of books from them) in the 80s and 90s.  Then-- bliss!-- this arrived.  A volume of hundreds of pages of out-of-the-ordinary (some of it extremely so) literature and info is something you'll like.  Obsessively readable and packed with minutiae, it's something to keep by the bedside for weeks of close reading (though don't let the kiddies too close).  It's a little like an internet on paper, wandering off in all directions, most of them fascinating.  Buy and read-- worth the money.	2001-07-24

Informative, funny, philosophical (there's a long section on the deaths of authors-- how they died, and how they'd _like_ to die), historical-- somehow it fits together beautifully, and amuses on every page.  I've recommended this to many friends, some of whom don't care for boxing; they share my enthusiasm for it.  Plimpton seems to be living to a ripe old age-- he deserves many more years of happiness for all the good writing he's done, especially here.	2001-07-10

The Mongo books defy any attempt at classification, and that's what makes them so entertaining, as well as the engaging writing by Chesbro.  They're thriller/comedy/occult/philosophical exercises that work very well (though the last two entries in the Mongo series are a bit less sterling-- sometimes even dogmatic).  Read this and the next four or five in the series (as well as the Chant and Veil books)-- it ain't Shakespeare, but it's entertainment of a high order.	2001-07-06

Though Powers is decidedly not for the casual reader, those looking for a challenge-- of their wits, of pre-conceived notions, of conventional genre restrictions-- will find happiness here.  Powers has been writing wondrous stuff for more than 20 years, and for my money he's seldom more than a degree or two away from perfection.  Other reviewers below note that he blows hot and cold; I'd disagree.  I haven't been disappointed by him yet, and it's been a pleasure to watch his growth over the years.  Newcomers to Powers' work may wish to start with On Stranger Tides or The Anubis Gates to see if his work strikes that inner chord of delight-- if so, march forward chronologically thru his works (after moving backward in time to The Drawing of the Dark).  Declare is his latest work of legerdemain, and a gem.  I'll be reading and re-reading his stuff for the rest of my life, and I'm thankful every time he adds a new one to the list.<br />Intelligent readers of genre fiction will share my enthusiasm.	2001-04-24

This (the fourth) is the least of the bunch, though, and the slide from excellence to mere competence is disspiriting.  Black Cross and Spandau Pheonix hummed with tension and had an inner consistency and logic missing from this book and from Mortal Fear.  The Quiet Game demanded too much suspension of disbelief for me, as our protagonist went bulling forward without posing questions any teenager would ask. He's shot at numerous times, and the would-be assassins are frequently killed-- do we learn who they were?  Does he ask?  He finds out that a potential witness has possibly damning tapes and records of a heinous crime-- does he ask to see them?  Major characters (Kelly) and plot-lines (the students' search for evidence in Marston's files) are introduced and then forgotten.  The lack of rigor on view here convinces me that this is an early novel that he revived without a thorough edit.  I hope his new novel reflects the polish of his first two.	2000-12-15

I was riveted-- other reviewers below seem not to have been enchanted as I was, but I think they've cheated themselves of a deep and meaningful experience.  Stewart, like Tim Powers, has a deft touch with fantasy, and creates a persuasive and comprehensible fantasy world that he peoples with &quot;real&quot; protagonists.  I've loaned this book to others, and do not hesitate to recommend it to mature readers with a taste for subtle fantasy.	2000-11-17

His laser-like drive to put his vision on paper has resulted in this collection, which is a masterwork.  By turns comical and bleak, Jimmy's story deserves to stand beside Maus and the collected works of Robt Crumb as an instance of graphic and narrative brilliance.  I doubt Ware will hit the road to flack for the book-- interviews show him to be too shy (and have too much integrity) to flog the thing as it should be flogged.  Buy it, pore over it, tell others-- this is a major and unequalled talent.	2000-10-03

The intrepid aficionado knows no boundaries when Flashy's  concerned.  Fraser's in a class by himself here; no one can do what he does  as well as he does it.

Poe fans and lit majors will get a kick out of it, and casual  readers of SF will enjoy it as well.

Clarens'  effort is clear and concise-- not too much on any one thing, but he manages  to hit all the necessarys and high spots.  It's really indispensible for  the fan who's starting out in a serious study of the subject-- or who just  loves horror.	2000-01-24

I'd recommend this for just about everyone, and  I'll be loaning it to many friends, especially those who a) like Hemingway,  or b) know Cuba very well.

He writes fantasy, but there sure aren't any trolls or hobbits or wizards here.  His fantasy is a brilliant pastiche of the mystical detritus of several civilizations funnelled into the late  twentieth century and then polished to a rare sheen by a fine, fine mind.  He knows his stuff, and the more knowledge of Edison  and Houdini and  mysticism and spiritism you bring to him, the better you'll like this--  Powers gets it all right, and makes an entertaining story something more.  This one's  a bit more convoluted than Last Call, but just as rewarding.  Along with its predecessor and sequel (Last Call and Earthquake Weather),  this creation stands as a milestone of late 20th century fantasy, and  should be enjoyed by all imaginative readers.	1999-03-16

Last Call was brilliantly engrossing, and Expiration Date perhaps a bit of a letdown to many (not to me), but Earthquake Weather fulfills all the promise of the first two books and then  some.  (BTW, don't try to read this without reading the first two.)  Powers  is unmatched in creating a &quot;real&quot; world where fantastic things  happen, and they happen a lot in this book.  Sit back and enjoy the  author's mastery of the off-kilter.  When I finished it,  I was moved to go  back and reread the first two volumes all over again.....  Powers, like  Jonathan Lethem, is comfortably inhabiting the house Philip K. Dick built,  and each is adding new wings.  I eagerly await his next offerings.	1999-03-16

This stands as the first of three books that are connected-- loosely in the case of Last Call and Expiration Date-- which  are then cemented together in the culminating volume, Earthquake Weather.   Powers is our best contemporary fantasist, casually and yet somehow  methodically stitching together our &quot;real&quot; world with another  reality based in myth and slightly skewed natural laws.  Some may not  &quot;get it&quot; (as the reviewer below), but for those who do it's like  vacationing in a kind of fictional Eden.  This  kind of fantasy is  refreshingly difficult to label-- it rewards imagination and erudition  (especially study of mythology and Elizabethan poetry-- as well a close  study of all types of popular culture) and never fails to entertain.   Powers is sometimes compared to PK Dick, but he's in a class by himself--  that's the highest praise I can offer.	1999-02-26
