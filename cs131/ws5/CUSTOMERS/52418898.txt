This books shares the usual high quality of Dover's pictorial art series. There's a vast array of posters to choose from, and you can access them in two different jpg sizes, which makes it very convenient should you want any of them printed on plotter. You'll find some of the best known posters of the era. I'm taking one star away because the choice was centered mainly on French and English designers, ignoring the work of American, Spanish and Italian artists that were just as hot at the time.	2005-07-25

So let me give a few reasons why this book is worth reading:<br /><br />a) The poem \\"Before I could call myself &Aacute;ngel Gonz&aacute;lez\\". Just for it, the book would be already worth buying. And if you are not convinced, read \\"Birthday\\", too.<br /><br />b) Because &Aacute;ngel Gonz&aacute;lez is such a different voice to everything else going on in Spanish poetry presently<br /><br />c) Gonz&aacute;lez's detached lyricsm is neither sentimental nor cold, striking a middle chord hard to find.<br /><br />Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez has quite an intimate voice, which comes across quite well in this antology's translation.	2005-01-23

Each painting gets a page long explanation, focused in one of the techniques employed or in some creativity issue relevant to the subject matter. The fact that most artists list the colors they used is definitely a plus. My only qualm with this book are that, being watercolor my medium of choice, I found this books places a lot of attention in oil (and if you're a pastelist or use some other technique, you're in an even worse position). Another minor flaw is the fact that the beautiful picture on the cover is not of those analyzed inside. However, I am being nitpicky, as this book is beatiful and inspiring, and will help anyone seeking to expand his or her creative horizons-	2004-07-20

The reason behind it is its elegant and sensitive mixture of  ingredients. Critics have compared the author, Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, with Eduardo Mendoza and Arturo P&eacute;rez Reverte, and indeed do we have a literary mystery, not unlike the kind P&eacute;rez Reverte used to excel at, and we have the early XXth century Barcelona as a background (and a very gothic Barcelona, at that), but in all fairness the references trascend those mentioned. This is the story of youngster Daniel Sempere, entrusted with the care of a unique book (&quot;The wind's shadow&quot;, exactly like the title of this novel). His research for information on the book's author will reveal as far more dangerous than he anticipated, and will teach him a thing or two about love and courage. This book has a magical quality to it, both in the collection of well rounded but altogether odd characters it portrays, in its description of the dark years after the civil war as in the strange tingling it leaves in your heart after reading it. A winner.	2003-01-02

Greer	The first in the new \\"Special topics in the Tarot\\" series, \\"Tarot reversals\\" is the great new book by the author of the classic \\"Tarot for your self\\". There's a big wealth of information on choosing your personal approach towards reversed cards (critical, as some of this approaches are in fact opposite), suggested meanings for both upright and reversed cards, considerations on what a majority of reversed cards stand for, spreads, examples, bibliography, resources and a very interesting essay on the heroine's journey, as opposed to the traditional hero's journey suposedly portrayed in normal position cards. Although this book isn't nearly as exercise heavy as \\"Tarot for your self\\", I still feel it merits five stars. It already would only because many aficionados have been waiting for one such for a long time, but the fact it's written by Ms Greer makes it a sure winner. It is a good addition for the intermediate/advanced tarot student's library.	2002-03-04

I bought this book solely out of respect for the author, as I enjoyed greatly both &quot;Tarot spells&quot; and &quot;Tarot your everyday guide&quot;. I didn't realise at the time that the book was focused on young adults taking the first steps in this field. I am 28 now, so I don't really feel I am young or an adult right now, but I have to say I shouldn't have worried, as this book is great for everyone. It covers a lot of things I've not seen anywhere else, such as card getting indyosincratic, making different interpretation systems compatible or searching for an specific card in a spread. And once again, I am impressed by the clarity, sense of humour and intelligence in which all this material is covered. If you are starting out with tarot, this is a great book. If you are not, it is still a valuable addition to your collection.	2001-11-29

Or at least that's what I expected). This book is one of the most complete works I've found on tarot understood not as a means to divination but as a way to find guidance. I really enjoyed the fact the cards came from several different decks. This is a rather unusual book, and it feels like a real treat to those who do a daily reading to focus in in the morning.The approach is simpler than Mary K. Greer's \\"Tarot for your self\\", which might be slightly daunting for absolute beginners (much as I love the book). Janina Renee is also the author of \\"Tarot spells\\", another book which goes beyond the repetition of material many works offer these days.	2000-11-28

This is a brilliant book for those who believe in journalling as a  therapeutic path. The authors adress life's main conflicts, and structure  the basic questions to be answered by the reader in terms of Joseph  Campbell's work. This book combines intellectual rigor with heartfelt  warmth, in a combination so rarely seen in similar books. I love this  subject and own a lot of material on it, but I find that many other volumes  either fall in the sirupy, newagey category or are dry and academic. This a  slim book, but it is worth every cent if you actually work with it.	2000-08-09

This book is crammed with affirmations related to the fears and horrors  every artist ends up going through at some point. Whereas I am not too keen  in affirmations, I found Mr Maisel's words extremely conforting and  intelligent. Although the affirmations are inspiring, this is a book with  practical advice as well, unlike so many others that adress similar  questions. It also contains a lot of quotations from famous artists who  apparently went through similar ordeals. &quot;Affirmations for  artists&quot; adresses many different kinds of disciplines and is  definitely a great gift for an artistically inclined person. If it ever  gets translated into Spanish I'm definitely giving it out to my friends.	2000-08-07

Gunter Grass won last's years Nobel and Principe Asturias prizes for his long standing, fully compromised career as a writer. His last work so far is &quot;My century&quot;, a collection of 100 vignettes, one for each year  of the XXth century. Some of this vignettes (not all of them are stories as  such) are interrelated, specially those portraying both World Wars and,  nearing the end of the book, some which explain Grass' personal  circumstances around the time. Mr. Grass requires a certain amount of  complicity and knowledge from his readers, so this is no easy book you can  read while lying on the beach (you can actually read it anywhere, but you  know what I mean). I strongly disagree with those who think that this makes  it an impossible book. Mr Grass prose can be at times fairly elaborated,  and he is addressing a reader who's going to try to be on pair with him all  along.  Having said that, I wouldn't be surprised if there already were  anotated editions of this book for German history high school students.This  in ambitious book, and obviously some of its parts will appeal diferent  readers. Just don't let anyone convince you that such an intelligent and  articulate piece of writing can't be entertaining as well. &quot;My  century&quot; is all this, and probably a lot more.	2000-08-01

If you read a couple of reviews on other tarot books here at amazon.com, you'll probably see a lot of people recomending &quot;Choice centered tarot&quot; at some point. The reason behind this is this books challenging  approach, based mainly on inner and outer focus rather than on positive or  negative meanings. But that is only a part of what goes on in Ms  Fairfield's book. There are brilliant essays on how to choose a deck (don't  only expect the usual &quot;choose one that resonates with you&quot;  approach here, you may realise quite a few things about your political  views depending on which deck you choose), how to design a spread, how to  read for groups and numerology, apart from card definitions diferent to the  usual ones. I am not saying that these explanations contradict what other  books may give on the subject. Rather, thet are complementary (and from my  experience, they work specially well for &quot;here and now&quot;  questions). In spite of this all, this is an easy book to read, and it will  specially suit intermediate tarot students (but can be read by everyone).	2000-07-31

The reasons behind this are the wonderful exercises you can find in it (the one called &quot;Look at a card&quot; is now so popular that you hardly can't find a new tarot  book that somehow doesn't quote it), the inspirational way to describe card  relationships and so many other things! The book draws heavily on a Jungian  approach, meaning that the author focuses on how a card resonates with  every different reader. Whereas this book will teach a lot on divination,  if you follow its programme it will teach even much more about your self. I  know there are other wonderful books on tarot, but this is the one I would  go for if I could buy just one.	2000-07-05

This is a neat idea, a package of cards that acts as an oracle to stimulate creativity, I thought when I first read about &quot;The Observation Deck&quot;. However, I didn't expect it to come with such an  interesting book of writing advice. Naomi Epel has been a literary escort  for years, and her examples come from top professionals. What's more, when  I started drawing I discovered the system worked for visual arts most of  the time. I am expanding on the cards for personal use.

There's a poetic undertone to his whole vision, but best of all, this is a  very entertaining book. You almost want to look up William Ashbless... when you finish reading it!

However, a premise is nothing if it's not carried out properly, and Bram Stoker gives us an account of how not to do  that. Charachters do all sort of ilogical things, so as visiting the  &quot;baddies&quot; for no real reason. The strenght of fantasy and horror  novels lies in their ability to make you belief this could happen to you  (meaning you have to feel empathic towards the characters and the plot must  have logical, even is surprising, turns). This is one thing this book fails  to do.	2000-07-03

If Fernando Pessoa had lived in an English-speaking country (and mind you, he spoke perfect English since childhood and wrote some of his poems in that language), he would probably be more popular among academians and  university students as Pound or Elliot. During his lifetime, he assumed a  number of names and personalities, which reflect different and  complementary ways of understanding life and poetry. From theoretical  paganism towards XXth century malaise, his work is very thorough. Whereas  some of his poems might seem a bit depressing (I am thinking about  &quot;The tobacco shop&quot; and &quot;The road to Sintra&quot;), the mere  fact somebody wrote something as beautiful and human makes them  enlightening. I know this isn't an academic review as such, but Pessoa's  poetry needn't only be read from you mind, but also from your gut. This a  book definitely worth buying if you consider yourself a poetry lover.	2000-06-30

However, this one might be one of the last I buy, as it's really useful. bought the book  yesterday and I am delighted with it. The advice on how to do things is  sound, and this is a book that encourages you to find your own style and  shows you how the same image may be rendered in such a different way by  different people. Unlike other books I own, this one is not only a set of  beautiful pictures. In fact, I didn't like some of the art displayed in it,  but this is in fact a plus, as it shows the variety of styles and effects  you can achieve with watercolour. I know that there are other techniques  not displayed in this book, but as a beginning step it's definitely worth  every penny.

Although each visualization focuses on mainly one aspect of each card, Galenorn gives you a lot of clues on how to write your own in case something is not covered. This is a very thorough book, which demands a level of commitment to be fully enjoyed, and although it will be suitable to tarot novices, I would recommend it to someone who's already acquainted with a deck or two. It doesn't include info on divination, but it does your tarot skills as a secondary result. The only reason I didn't give it four stars is that I expected the CD to contain all 22 visualizations and it only contains two of them.

There aren't any Writer's Digest type of articles here or heavy discussions on plot or character.  This is a book made of the stuff it  suggests you to do, writing practice, understood as free form, stream of  consciousness writing. Its inspirational essays guide you through Mrs  Goldberg's creativity process and encourage you to start writing and  discover yourself in the process. Some people won't like its cheerful,  honest tone, but for some of us writing is more than just craft. If this is  your approach, this book will be worth every cent (and I wrote a poem on  cheese that has been a great success as a result of this writing practice).	2000-06-26

The meditations are  thoroughly thought out, and the book includes suggestions in enhancing the  experience by celebration.Also, there are a few meditations centered on  Deities and there's one for each four of the elements. The only flaw I see  in this book, as in most pagan oriented books, is it's heavy anglosaxon  feel (but then again I suppose you can't please everyone). Also, it is such  a pity that there wasn't an accompanying CD going with the book. This has  been partially corrected in Yasmine Galenorn's new book &quot;Tarot  journeys&quot;.

Funnily enough, when I first received this book I was somewhat disappointed. I had learnt to draw with Betty Edward's &quot;Drawing on the right side of the brain&quot; and somehow mister Nicolaide's book seemed a  little too academic to me. False. This is a wonderful book, with exercises  that to last for a lifetime. The author states that you should use them in  the prescribed order, but I think it will benefit those who have worked  through the Edwards' book but still want more. Although the book is  brilliantly inspirational and oozes with a kind sense of humour, it  shouldn't be mistaken as new agey stuff. You do learn to draw if you put  the hard work it requires.

It tells of Alatriste's new  adventure in XVII century Spain. Whereas the first book in the series was  relatively light-hearted, this second book dwelves on one of the darkest  episodes of Spanish history, the Inquisition, and is a deep but very  entertaining exploration of the darkest corners in Spanish character.  However, this is only a part of what goes on in this book. There's also  quite a bit of swashbuckling adventure, romance, and mistery. The action is  tightly plotted, and some historical figures make brief cameos. The author  has put a lot of care in using a language that's not too modern for the  story but that isn't academic, either.

Now I am drawing fairly decent portraits from almost  everyone I know. The book focueses on seeing the things' real shapes and it  is just this non rational, non mathematically based approach that makes it  work. I used to have big problems with proportions and perspective, and  Betty Edwards made me realise it's all a matter of looking at things with  loving attention (and not attaching a name to the bit you are drawing).

My only problem with this book is I  didn't really understand the point of a couple of exercises, but then again  it might be because I am not a native English speaker. However, it's still  a good purchase if you don't have the time or the inclination to go to a  workshop.	1999-04-25
