The Boxes is a middle-of-the-road book written by William Sleator, a mastermind of young reader's science fiction books. Some pros and cons...<br />-Cons<br />-SLOW CHARACTERS: for the people being in high school, they're kinda short in the intelligence end, as some parts to the story are glaringly obvious, yet they can't figure it out.<br />-ODD ENDING: the ending calls for a sequel, as its a cliffhanger, but is there one? The plot leaves no remaining probles for the protagonist to solve, yet somehow it still isn't finished...hmmm..... <br />-Pros<br />-CREATIVITY: even though this is another one of those books in which the hero has to save the whole world, this is VERY original. The ficticional creatures (duh, its sci-fi) and their customs are very imaginative, yet not over-the-top<br />-SUSPENSE: even with all of the flaws mentioned above, I raced thowards the climax & ending. (even though it was a let-down...) You should be able to finish this book  very short amount of time.<br />-BOTTOM LINE: This is simply an average book. There's thousands better, and thousands worse. If you're a sci-fi fan, why not add this to your collection?<BR>-crf	2003-10-11

I own all of the FoxTrot & Get Fuzzy books, a fair amount of Dilbert and all but one of the Calvin and Hobbes collections. I also own Stephen Pastis's first book featuring expressionless animals (a rat & a pig) one of which finished third in an IQ test with his door. (the pig) But, I seriously think that this comic started by a law student and helped along by Scott Adams and Darby Conely will soon be in competition with the big boys. Instead of reading about Calvin's latest backyard adventure presented with brilliant colors, we will be reading about a rat that shows his mouth one in fifty times explaining his latest \\"ology\\" (cheesepuffology...) to a stupid pig cannibal who once went to the lake every day to talk to his quiet \\"friend\\" that was under the water. As a sidekick, we have a zebra who is always explaining his latest failures among his pack, trying to prevent getting eaten by lions. Prize material. <br />Great series include:<BR>-the Cap O Immortality<BR>-Rat the Marrige Counselor<BR>-Rat the Stock Broker<BR>-Rat the novelist (the Adventures of Angry Bob)<BR>-Fruit Buddies Meeting<BR>-Rat's first girlfriend, Farina the Bubble Pig<br />I seriously think that you will laugh at loud at this book more times than you can count on one hand, if not two. Definitely worth the buy. I'm sure all of the other books made by Pastis in the future will be worth the dough, too.<BR>...	2003-06-06

It has excellent scenes from the middle of country (Chicago) to all four corners (San Diego, Seattle, Maine, Tamps Bay) of the country. Fleischman is masterful with just 130 pages.<br />The plot is kinda odd. The main character, Brent, has just moved to Chicago from Atlanta. He assumes that being seen with this one girl would really help his reputation, instead, he gets dumped by her in front of a whole party. As he drives home, he decides to kill himself by ramming into another car.He escapes with scratches, & kills the 18-year-old girl in the other car. Her mom ask him to do something (that would allow people to remember her daughter) that involves the four corners of the country, obviously. Its amazing what a little thinking & alone time can do to one (Brent, in this case). Its such a vivid story, you might as well be on the Greyhound bus. If you are a fan of fiction in any way, shape or form, this book can NOT go past unread. Its even short for those of you who don't really like reading.	2003-01-17

He has to live in a different home every week. His Grandpa, a Vietnam Vet who lives with his dad, doesn't have half of his right leg.<br />It may seem an odd story line, but this one of the better books that I have read.  Since it was a gift, I tried to cherish the book with its hardcover price. Forget that. 'Standing Tall' is a tale of triumph, & provides inspiration for those whose parents are divorced, or for those who have been in war. It is not totally a gripping plot, yet it is a gripping book. The story flows excellently even though most of the paragraphs are not much more than a full sentence. I strongly urge you to get this book now. No. Really.	2003-01-01

This book was suspense filled, it was a shocker, it's not going to get out of your hands until you've read every last word.<br />Connor's friend, Branwell's, little sister is hurt. The 911 call (on the back cover) shows a usually talkative Branwell stays silent, while a female British voice explains that he dropped little Nikki. When he goes to the Behavoir place, he stays silent for about 20 days. This mystery, not led by your typical Sherlock & Watson (13-year-old & half-sister), takes many twists & turns, guided by a guy who isn't even speaking.<br />I give this 4 1/2 stars instead of five because I got confused during the first parts. Otherwise, you simply should pick up this page-turning mystery/occasionaly humorous book right away. No, really. Now.	2002-12-15

Statistics show that he is an excellent all-round player, probably better than most fans make him out to be.<br />On top of being a star, Aaron's story is amazing with all of the racism, discrimination &amp; hate that he went through.<br />After reading this book, you will probably wonder why No. 715 was only SECOND on mastercard's most memorable moments. Also, you may, like me, want Hank to keep the home run record forever. I'd rather have someone who worked hard for it than a hideously overpaid A-Rod, or stuck-up Bonds. <br />Bottom line: get this book if you enjoy sports at all.	2002-12-14

His 90-acre land is being plagues by cicadias, mammoth bugs that come out once every 17 years. His e-mails to friends are often halarious, &, with Rosen's good writing skills, you, the reader, can easily dictate what life is like in the Riley house. <br />I have to admit, some of his newletters (letters in newspaper-like form to a wide selection of addresses) are HALARIOUS!!! I'm just wondering is that BEAVER CREEK BEACON stuff is true. <br />Although some of the stuff is funny, the actual plot isn't very exciting. I don't know how much more exciting it could get, given that the book was written in e-mails. That, however doesn't take away from the book's overall good-ness. (in my opinion)<br />Among other things, you can learn cool smileys.<BR>Mouse:        <:   3   )~~~~~~~<br />If you've ever looked at the \\"Snail-Mail No More\\" book(s, I think), & thought that it was a good idea, DON'T pick it up.

When my librarian first explained to me this book, she said that this boy did something bad & had to chat with an eldrly person for 30 minutes twice a week as punishment (the plot of this story). I thought that we'd have some  criminals here like in \\"Zach's Lie,\\" or even \\"Holes.\\" But, this wasn't that big of a misdeed. Well, yeah, it was, but... <br />Let's just say when you're reading the book & enjoying it, this is a four-star book. When you think back to the plot, it doesn't make all thaqt sense, and you'll probably think of it as an average book.(3, 3 1/2 stars)(note: for such a short book, the character set was VERY well-developed. Even Wootie, who will only be heard by writing) The only five-star piece of writing was with Troer & the _ _ _ _ . I thought that that was very clever. <br />Some of this has to do with the label. I AM above the suggested reading age (grades 3-5), but I think that this book should be for dudes/duettes 7-10.<br />If you're 7-10, enjoy this book, but I'd wait 'till it comes out in paperback.	2002-12-13

The start of this book may be somewhat like starting \\"The Giver.\\" Here you have it (if you haven't gathered by the cover), a community, this one UNDER THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, that is choc-full of unusual rules, customs, & traditions, simply because they have not lived by anything else. In this book, you, the Topsider (I mean, HOPEFULLY you're a Topsider...) are an evil person. The surface that you live on is never to be touched. The white things that come from the sky are poison. Why do you live in so much light? We are forbidden to go near your surface, for you are evil.<br />(FYI, just to clear this up, the Downsiders aren't evil)<br />From ages 12-16, you go on three month shifts with a group of three. On the Hunting shift, you take people from the High Perimeter area, make them leave everything behind, including their name; and they become a \\"faller,\\" a new member of this well-hidden community. One day, Talon brings a faller that hasn't finished all of the requirements.....<br />I will leave you with that starter right there. The back of the book, in this case, reveals to much of the plot. It would be better to fully read the teaser after about halfway through the book.<br />Anyways, this is a great & gripping novel. Here's some things that I really liked about it: <BR>-In most books, you can tell what the climatic scene is going to be. But reading this, I had NO CLUE as to what was coming. <BR>-I really enjoyed the scene where _ _ _ _ _ goes to the <BR>_ _ _ _ _ _ _. Shusterman explains these otherwise ordinary things as if _ _ _ _ _ , or you, were exploring an alien world. This message is defiitely something that we should ponder. Shusterman's point(s) is(/are) worth thinking about because he describes this scene so wonderfuly. It is a great reminder to be thankful for what we have.<br />If you have read all of this jumble, or if you haven't, here's the bottom line: BUY THIS BOOK!!!<br />If time is of low importance, why do I have to get off of the computer?.....read it you'll understand.	2002-12-12

Scott Adams has jokes that may step over the line in a businessman's perspective, but if you're a comics fan, its like gold.<br />In this book, we have the best of the beginning, the outrageous of the origin, the super of the Seven. In this book, you will get no new comics, but something that I think every popular comic strip compilation should have. Comments from the author. Somehow, they enrich your reading by providing insights such as: if Adams thought it was dumb, what parts of this outrageousness actualy IS true. Or presenting a phrase that kills him (with laughter!) every time (can you chant?). I'm glad he took the time.<br />In this book, Adams has a few paragraphs/a page or two about every character, as small as its role may be. <br />The characters include:<BR>-Dilbert<BR>..& Dogbert<BR>...& Technology<BR>..in the Business world<BR>...& women <BR>...& his ego<BR>...Dies<BR>...Travels<BR>...Attempts to join the Consumer Society<BR>-Dogbert<br />..the Early, Vulnerable days<BR>...Reveals his Sarcasm <BR>..& the many occupations<BR>..Schemes to Conquer the World<BR>...Saves Dilbert<BR>-Ratbert (\\"Timmy\\" is the best EVER!!!!)<BR>-Garbageman<BR>-Liz<BR>-Dilmom & Dildad<BR>-Bob & the dinosaurs<BR>-Catbert<BR>-Phil<BR>-Asok (he's cool!)<BR>-Tina the Tech Writer<BR>-Elbonians (crack-ups!)<BR>-The Boss <BR>-Alice<BR>-Wally (my fav character)<BR>-Carol<BR>-Critters<BR>-Dogbert in Hats<BR>-Ted the Generic Guy<BR>-Slapstick (the phrase, that isn't a person!)<BR>He missed janitor.<br />Ah, well.

Bill Watterson brings to the table what no other cartoonist can bring: a true artistic, not cartoon, ability. Take just about any Sunday funnies in this book, among others. You will usually see a mass array of panels. They appear to be just a jumble,  yet are arranged so that you can easily follow while reading, coming together with a great punchline at the end, or a beautiful portrait of the forest that Calvin & Hobbes walk through, or, both.<br />What strikes me funny about this strip, more than others, is the intelligent conversations of this otherwise typical six-year-old boy. Some of them I'll have to read a comic a few times over to get the conversation, much less the punchline.<br />Something ELSE that strikes me is how much of Calvin's ethical conversations about just about anything make sense almost half a decade later. I'm sure it's make sense 10-15 years from now, too. That's what helps make this cartoon so timeless & classic.<br />Its just too bad that Watterson had to end while at the top, It'd be much cooler if Calvin & Hobbes was still running today.<br />You should simply just drop anything you're doing & get the book now. You just can't miss out on Calvin's magical world.	2002-12-10

Sagax, Scarum, & Kroova sneaking away, a peaceful springtime back at the Abbey, and Triss with friends Drufo, Shogg, & Welfo with things looking a tad grim in their slave lives.

If you are an avid reader of these books, you will certainly know that Lemony Snicket, or whoever this guy is, is definitely not your run-of-the-mill children's writer. No, not at all. In addition to writing a hit series, he has pulled pranks like filling up two pages with a couple hundred copies of the word \\"ever\\", or filling two pages with ink. Or how about his autobio that didn't really help readers understand anything about the now-puzzling series, but was just a series of nonsense? It may have been at that point, or maybe at book #4, when Olaf is \\"disguised\\" pitifuly as a female-but whenever it happened- this series has simply gone too far.<br />Lets think back, just a little bit, to just about any book in the series. Olaf & a few of his troupe have put on disguises, chasing the Baualdaires to various places, fooling the parents, getting sooo close to one of the children, & then failing. Gee, wonder what the plot of this one is. Yeah, it could be worth the ten bucks, but the stuff at the end may be the  only part worth reading. Otherwise, you have 200 pages of Snicket explaining what Sunny's babble means, magicaly understanable to Violet & Klaus, explaining what semi-complicating words mean, encouraging you to put the book down & run away from it, & inching the reader ever so closer to: the Snicket file, VFD, & maybe even the truth as to if the parents are alive. Tell ya' what, I'm tired of that chiding to the end, only to find out that , miserably, they are worse off than before. Tired of being teased, goaded to find out what the real answer to everything is. Yeah, I'll still read the series (you should, too), but the series needs an end, SOON. <br />Lemony Snicket, or whoever he is, is truely a great author, but he's just wasting his time. Here's my idea that would please me: end the series in the next one, and then start a brand new saga!!!<br />This is getting \\"monotonous,\\" a word here which means: the constant reuse of the same plot....	2002-12-03

A very original story.<br />Here's the basic plot: It WAS just another ordinary day for Hermux Tantamoq, watchmaker; but then Linka Perflinger, not one that he knew, brings in a badly damaged watch that MUST be repaired by tommorow morning. After working hard, Hermux eventualy finishes the difficult task of making the watch good as new. But Linka doesn't come. Doesn't come for weeks.

First, you have to keep it somewhere safe. If you don't, it can get stolen & kinda defeat the purpose. When someone with one of these jobs annoys you, come to your book. Read a few pages about his/her job. Next time you see them,you can laugh at them cruelly/really hard at them for reasons otherwise unknown.Of course, if someone has done this at anytime to YOU, well, now you know.<br />You must get this book.

Even in Orlando for a week, amid all of the parks &amp; amusements, this book held my attention for the whole week. No, I wasn't walking around Epcot, hooked to the book, (could you imagine me on a roller coaster, reading while everyone else was screaming ;&gt;) but it was the next thing. Driving home, I would try to soak in those few paragraphs by the light from the lamposts. Needless to say, this book is very gripping, &amp; is a must, must, must for any fantasy or sci-fi fan.<br />I've read the reviews for future books, &amp; gather that Jordan hits a bump in the road somehwere along here. Definitely not in this volume. Reviewers complain that the good guys are kind of nags. Not here. Nynanevae turns kind of stubborn in this one, though.<br />With all of the characters, unusual cities, OhmygoshwhatsgonnahappenIcan'tbelieveit climaxes, and the haunting Ba'alzamon, Darkhounds, &amp; Forsaken that loom so close to the ta'averen that Jordan inserts, you WILL get trapped in this series.

This, unlike most Redwall books, does not involve any big armies (well, it does, but there's no fighting climax). This is NOT just a typical: bad-guy-takes-over-good-guy-forms-army with-common-people-to-save-the-day type of book. Its really quite an interesting plot. Of all of the characters, most of them play a main part in the story. The book has two different scenarios going on: the Juskarath vermin clan & the Redwall Abbey. The vermin part is the more exciting, but one of Jacques's excellently-written riddles is going on back at the Abbey. I won't tell too much of the plot, a huge part is right at the beginning.<br />This is a great book to sit down with, and just get lost in the Redwall world for hours on end. Every single one of the 15 books is like that. Its not one of those books that you just put down & wonder why you took the time. Like I said, it starts right off with a TON of action. Its too bad the books have to end! Jacques needs to start producing two or three a year!	2002-11-01

I STILL don't understand the point of it, doing all of the projects & such. The beginning, or the whole first half, is really pretty boring. This litle brat, hating everyone unreasonably except her mother who she doesn't even know. the next thirty-or-so pages, the \\"best\\" part, she then turns into a loving, caring lil thing for her foster family after attempting to run away. Soon, swamped in her own doings, she is sent away, miserably from her home. The end is a cliffhanger. But, it seems like more of the story is supposed to go on before you are left guessing. Throughout the whole thing, the plot almost never leaves you guessing. You KNOW Cortney is going to come, you KNOW something bad is going to happen to Gilly. Just not worth your time.	2002-10-28

Soon, Brian Jacques brings in the bad guy, \\"Fire Bringer\\" is a tad more than a tad different. By the end of the FIRST chapter, the good side's hopes are looking a tad more than a tad grim. By about page 200, it seems like nothing but impending doom will come.<br />If you are one of the many people that is saying, \\"500 pages, I would be bored out of my skull by the time I finish that,\\" you're wrong. In the first few chapters or so, David Clement-Davies has got you pretty comfortable with this whole deer subject, and you probably will be very familiar with the Herd. Once all of the talking deer stuff & all their ways become normal, Clement-Davies fires curves rapidly that are both very suprising and unusual, and all of them change the main outcome of the story somehow. Trust me, the book is not a drag.

He was taken to Marshank, where he was somewhat of a rebel. He was particularly mad because Badrang, the Tyrant of this (Marshank was his fortress)area, had stolen his father's sword from him.

Obviously not as lengthy as Redwall at 240 pages but is just as good of a story! Unlike Redwall, the story takes place in a human world, and only three different creatures (mice, rats, and two bats are main characters). The rats living in the sewers under Jupiter, thier never-seen-before god, are described very .......well. The rats, always working in the mine, with, obviously, no place to clean any part of their body, stay stinky and smelly the whole story. The story is somewhat spooky because the plot keeps on practically forcing the mice to go back into the dark sewers over and over (including kid mice). Also, the evil powers of Jupiter far surpass the often violence found in Redwall. Lovers of David Clement-Davies, Brian Jacques, Avi, and J.K.

Unlike the early years of Garfield, (or \\"classic\\" Heathcliff)  the number of cheap laughs in this book is reduced to single digits.<br />There, not-so-suprisingly, are very huge artistic contrasts in the FoxTrot comics between now and 1988. There is even a change of drawing styles even inside this book, containing the first 10-11 months of FoxTrot cartoons.<br />Even way back then, Amend (rhymes with \\"Raymond\\") still had a creative mind. In one Sunday cartoon, Roger was reading the Sunday comics; and on that fictional newspaper was the first panel of the cartoon that you were reading.<BR>In Paige's room, there was a picture of a unicorn with a little a little fairy on the ground.

These strips are the funniest.<br />Scott Adams creates the perfect comics for people who have an office job, and people who don't (like me ,BWAHAHA!!!!). I strongly suggest that you buy this book.	2002-05-28

True, we do have the single, desparate man, the powerful cat, and the stupid dog, but it is entirely different. Rob (owner) isn't close to being nerdy, has a friend (Joe), and is more powerful than Jon. Satchel (dog) has a voice, isn't a kick-thingy (even though it may be a book title). Bucky (cat) does destroy things, but has a more cruel mind than Garfield, sleeps in a drawer (instead of a box) isn't as lazy as Garfield (which is hard to be) and wrecks something about every day. <BR>Rob's mom doesn't live on a farm, and Christmas isn't that big of a deal as it is in Garfield.<BR>But, Garfield-lovers, this is still a truly halarious pet comic that will have you rolling one the floor in laughter repeatedly. A must-have to a comic-lover's collection.	2002-05-26
