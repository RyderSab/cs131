The 2 main things this book will give you are<br /><br />1.  How to use the new features in Camera Raw and Adobe bridge to do some work on your images before you pass them into photoshop, this includes cropping and curves.<br /><br />2.  A good introduction to workflow- in fact if you have this book I don't think you need the other cs2 workflow book out there.  This one is pretty through even including automation techniques.<br /><br />Overall I'm pretty happy with this book, I found some the information a bit useless for me, but someone else may find it invaluable.  The whole metadata section and how to edit the xml file for example.	2005-07-29

I don't agree with the authors avoidance of 16 bit process so that is why it doesn't get 5 stars.  I bought this mainly to learn all the new feature in photoshop cs2 and the book covers those features very well.  Especially the new smart sharpening feature and the enhanced camera raw, and all the other new features.  Also it includes a multi-tone grey card to help with color balancing.  This books covers in a much more intresting fashion- the material in the new cs2 manual included with the cd.  The nice thing here is that the author offers example settings that probably can be applied to 85% of your images as is and give you good results.	2005-05-04

This book contains a lot of infomation on how to get started on photography from a business perspective- However a lot of the chapters are taken from other books.  Also it is very dry reading- kinda like reading a text book, its stuff you should know but you probably take a few naps before you actually finish the book.	2005-04-20

If you just beginning to used photoshop cs, this is not the book for you.  This book is aimed at the experience user who not only want to know more advanced photoshop techniques but also want to know why photoshop does what it does, in other words how photoshop thinks.  Its not an encyclopedia that cover every little feature methodically, instead it covers advanced concepts in themes such as Color management, image manipulation and output.  Great book, very informative, like a textbook in some respects.  Until you've read it, you dont' really understand photoshop.	2005-03-14

I don't really think its negative on digital in fact he writes with a pretty even hand on film and digital.  My favorite part is the that not only does he show some photos that have sold at stock agencies, he goes onto to explain why they sold, and to compare to them to a similiar photo and explain why one sold and the other was rejected.  It offers a lot of insight into the mind of stock photo buyers as well as some inside tips on getting in on the business.	2005-03-11

Basically it covers the concepts you need to know in order to capture good color images on your digital camera that can then later be converted to black and white.  It further goes on to explain and suggest all the various options open to you to make this photo marketable and or a work of art.  While I don't agree 100% with everything said, I am on board for 95%.  The provided photos are great and inspiring and the book address both manual ways in photoshop to convert to B/w (besides just clicking greyscale or desaturate) as well as the plugins available out there.  Having said this,be aware that this is a very photoshop centric book too.	2005-03-09

It covers the basic of photoshop from a general user's perspective and say a photographer's or artist's.  It has some very basic exercise that help you learn you way around photoshop but with the exception of a tip on using the high pass filter, doesn't really offer much in the way of really useful info.	2005-03-08

I liked this book a lot, most books from o'reilly are superb.  It it falls into my one pet peeves, along with the 90 percent of digital photography books.  It puts all the emphasis on the digital and very little on the photography.  This book will not help you take better pictures with your digital camera, it will help fix and process pictures in photoshop and other program, so really it should be called expert techniques in digital photo processing.  That being said, it has some great chapters on digital workflow, photoshop and 3rd party photoshop plugins, as well as retouching techniques.  All of these go more in depth then what you find in most photoshop books alone.	2005-01-06

It is not a beginners cd- in other words its objective is to teach you the more advanced uses of photoshop.  Jayse is a cool guy who explains everything very well and used a logical and easy to follow workflow.  This one dvd encapsulates techniques that I had to search through 5 other books to find.  Also if you email the Author Jayse, he is more than happy to answer your questions.	2004-12-31

But this isn't a picture book, it is quite possibly one the most well written and to the point books on exposure out there.  The author deals with exposure, not your camera, or its features, but on capturing the right amount of light.  Regardless of the equipment your using.  This was of great use to me, as all the digital photography books out there, worry to much about the digital part and not enough about the photography part.<br />This book will explain to you the things you need to consider in order to achieve proper exposure and give you some quick tips and finding that all important 18% grey point.<br />He also weighs in on the concepts of bracketing as well as the exposure rules of thumb.  In a sense slaying those sacred cows and tell you ways to get the exposure right for that particular event instead of taking bracketed shots and hoping to get a good one out of the 3.	2004-12-30

But it only gets 3 stars because it never really get in depth to anythings.  Harldy what I'd expect from a book about 'mastering' anything.  However what it amounts to is a slight verbose form of some really good tips on shooting various subjects.  Sports, macro,portrait- the author shares with you his 'best practices'for these and that makes a good book to have on the shelf.	2004-12-28

It explains more about composition than just the 'rule of thirds'.  I would have liked a little more practical information, as the books spends a little to much time explaining theory and not as much as showing it in practice, but even with that, it still tells you more about how to compose an actual photography then 3/4 of the other books out there.  I would give it 5 stars if it were updated for the digital age and the color options and white balance issue that digital cameras bring to the table.	2004-12-16

Having said that this book contains some great information and even more importantly really great photos with explainations as to why they author feels they are good or not so good.  If the best way to learn to take photos is to see good photos, then this book helps greatly as the photos are throughout the book and not relagated to a few pages at the center.	2004-07-28

Get over it, move on, when dealing with digital tradition  cmyk is not dead-but RGB is in wide use if not wider.  Still for overall theory and heavy duty learning this is still a great book.	2004-07-12

As an IT pro who has to support this type of technology at time in our printing plants, it helped fill in the gaps I had in my printing and imaging specific knowledge.  This book covers a broad range of topics- so think of it more as a primer to get you ready for more advanced topics in other books.	2004-06-18

But beware, its is out of date on a few things.  The most glaring being the rules for using indirect object pronouns.  Other things that would benefit from an update is the spelling of certain pretrite conjucgations.  But none of these problems are show stopper.  On the whole the book will do a good job helping you cement in basic spanish.	2003-06-18

Being that I work in I.T.  in a city that is around 75% hispanic I find this to be a nice touch.<br />The Tapes are nice, and the book is well laid out.  I recomend it to fill in all the gaps that spanish 'textbooks' have.	2003-05-21

This is a great book.  It chiefly shows how a show like the Simpsons can provide different levels of entertainment to different people.  In this case is focuses on what the show had to offer to folks of a philosophical bent.  Now this is a collection of essays written by different authors and while as a whole the book is awsome, that doesn't mean some of the essays aren't on the dry side, but only  1 or 2 in my opinion.  This book would be a great way of gettting a grip on certain philosophical ideas without getting bored to death by a textbook and picking up some simpson's trivia along the way.	2002-07-01

This book is very well thought out and covers alot of little gotcha's in designing a night club.  Gotcha's that in my experience most club owners ignore or don't know about, and then wonder why nobody comes to their clubs.<br />My only critism is that the author could have explained things further if the book had more pages.  He summarizes a ton of infomation well to fit in the books alotted length but really on the business side of things, I suspect he could have filled another book altogether.	2002-07-01

As such if you looking for a book that covers not only the history of the style but also the some of the history of the island that developed it, and does so in depth, this is the book for you.

Not only that but there are some errors that give away the fact that one the author's reference were obviously older isshinryu books that are know to have said errors.  Also there are no techniques in this book, its purpose is more aimed at just giving the history of Isshinryu.  However with errors, like the founder's birthday being the wrong day and year, it could use a little bit more work.	2002-02-13

I bought it as a reference and to so that I  wouldn't have to write down everything from dance class.  But upon reading  it I find almost every dance is presented in ways I have never been taught  or seen practiced in any of the clubs here in San Antonio.  I think maybe  the Salsa step was the same and some the rumba but all the other dances  just look wrong.  Also the dance frames shown are the type of holds I have  been taught as wrong. ( hand on the poor girls kidney instead of higher  up.)  In terms of the step being taught the diagrams and descriptions are  not clear and many times they will use a term like Ball-Flat without  defining the term anywhere in the book.<br />Overall a very poor effort- I  wish I had not spent the money on it.	2000-09-18

It lacks in two things:  1. Proper editing.  I don't believe words are mistranslated- they are misspelled.  This is the editors  fault. 2. Better pictures- The pictures on the outside cover of the book  are great- but the insided pictures leave a lot to be desired.  They are  grainy black and white photos that look like old newspaper photos.  They  allow you to get the general idea of a posture or stance but details of a  particular technique are lost.	1999-10-27

It gives a nice historical perspective on Uechi-ryu Karate.  Sensei Mattson has done a lot to help spread karate here in the U.S.  One word of warning- in this (his first book) the term Karate and  Kung-fu is sometimes used interchangably- Consider that this book was  published in 1963 and those words did not mean quite the same as they do  today.
