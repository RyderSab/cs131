When most Americans go abroad, they explore prefer to Paris or sip espresso in a warm villa in Tuscany. When Kaplan goes abroad he finds himself traveling in countries where underpaid soldiers shake him down for bribes to pass their checkpoints and people live in appallingly squalid conditions. “Ends of the Earth” will give the reader a vivid feel for life in the Third World. <br />Kaplan’s “Atlantic Monthly” article, “The Coming Anarchy”, is kind of a primer for reading “Ends of the Earth” (portions of it re-appear): much of the world depicted by Kaplan is nasty, brutal and harsh, as the collapse of law and order leads to a repeating circle of violence and chaos. The more the state collapses under the strain of violence, the more the violence increases. Environmental decay, in turn, makes natural resources scarce, which causes people to fight over these ever-dwindling resources. Kaplan concentrates on Africa in the original article but he has expanded on that point in “Ends of the Earth”, by pointing out that his thesis is applicable to other problems in the world: China, India, Egypt, Turkey, etc. <br />Kaplan basically backpacks around each of the countries, staying in slummier hotels and living with local families. Like any good travel writer, Kaplan gives the writer a vivid feel for the places he goes to. A lot of travel readers might find Kaplan’s focus on history uninteresting, but I appreciate it because I agree that where we’ve been is the closest indicator of where the world is going. Someone once said that a page of history is worth a volume of logic, and I think Kaplan illustrates how history and geography dictate what sort of culture, economy and foreign policy a nation has. <br />I particularly enjoyed the sections of the book dealing with Iran. I’ve long been fascinated by the Persian land, with its ancient culture.Kaplan presents a country that is misunderstood in the Western world: Iran is a land of rich culture and a deep appreciation of art and beauty. The picture that Kaplan presents to the reader is that, unlike the rest of the Arab world, with its spare and dogmatic adherence to Islam, Iran is a country with a deep appreciation of beauty and a great capacity for tolerance. Its people are intelligent and open-minded, its society is not rife with chauvinism and hatred and there is great possibility in Iran for a meaningful dialogue. The cultural observations Kaplan noted: how open-minded Iranian students were, how Iranian women were treated better and were more assertive than their Saudi counterparts, how tolerant the Shi’ite brand of Islam seemed compared with its more warrior-like Sunni counterparts, are all important clues to Kaplan that Iran is a nation far more willing to break bread with the U.S. and have some sort of partnership. The section on Iran is well-worth the price of the book.<br />One of the great things about Kaplan’s writing is his ability to smoke out trends or facts that escape the notice of the modern media. His comments about Iranian culture and society are an example of this. Also interesting is seeing how environmental scarcity and ethnic and religious tensions drive history: the growth of the Thai sex industry, for example, has much to do with deforestation in northern Thailand. (In the book Kaplan explains that logging by the Thai military means that rural villagers in the north can no longer make ends meet because their farmland is being destroyed, so many girls in their teens and twenties go to Bangkok to work in the massage parlors and the go-go bars.) Before reading “Ends of the Earth” I didn’t know that, and I doubt that people would make the causal connection between the two. <br />Liberals, I suspect, won’t have much to cheer from reading “The Ends of the Earth”, and most of Kaplan’s critics sit on the left. Kaplan seeshimself as a classical realist, so he has no words of praise for idealists or those who bring their ideological causes to an analysis of the world. These liberals who think U.S. law enforcement customs are possible in the Third World are, Kaplan believes, getting the world wrong by bringing their own ideology to the table.<br />Unsurprisingly, Kaplan’s unsparing criticism of African politics and government has provoked many to roundly denounce him as a racist, a charge that simply doesn’t hold water. Kaplan is no racist: he sees disorder and writes about it, and he sees the lack of African development and freedom (as compared with Europe and America) as mostly being a function of environment and social factors. Unlike many liberals, Kaplan has actually bothered to try and travel like a native citizen would: no limousines, no private jets. The world that he sees is the world that people live in. There is nothing racist in that. <br />Critics also fail to note that Kaplan has criticized Western nations like France, England, Portugal, and Germany for drawing borders in Africa without any sort of concern for having them actually make geopolitical sense. As a consequence, Kaplan notes, often ethnic tribes are cut in half by European borders, contributing to the lack of unity and the social strife that has engulfed West Africa. <br />Finally, I wish that Kaplan had devoted a bit more time in his travels to India and Southeast Asia, instead of Central Asia. As Kaplan notes, he’s been to Pakistan ten times in his life, so he has written volumes about the country. I was fascinated to read about India, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand because they were so different from the places Kaplan usually goes culturally and politically. After I got done reading the final section on Indochina, I thought: “I want to know more!”<br />In the final analysis, “Ends of the Earth” is a terrific book. Those interested in the world around us will be fascinated. I highly recommend.	2003-08-15

I have followed his work for a while and I eagerly read his dispatches in “The Atlantic”. His writings about the third world- the Balkans, Asia and Africa -is stunningly good work. He brings a critical eye to these regions and reports little known or appreciated facts about these places. <br />“An Empire Wilderness” is about Kaplan’s travels through North America’s faster-growing Western regions. Along the way Kaplan reports on what he sees as being the big cultural and economic forces at work in these places: immigration from Mexico and Asia, the collapse of America’s urban centers, the globalization of American business, the spread of the new type (post-urban) suburbs, etc. Along the way, Kaplan makes a number of startling statements and discoveries:<br />Kaplan’s declaration about a bus trip that American buses were less safe than ones he had been on in the third world did startle me. The notion that America has some of the forces acting upon it the same way Kaplan saw those forces acting on the Third World societies he has visited probably terrifies most Americans and explains why Kaplan is on record as being frustrated at what he perceives to be an inaccurate assessment of “Empire Wilderness” by newspaper reviewers as a tract pessimistic about the future of the United States. Kaplan sees the future as bright . . . for most people. With the decline of the middle class, those who are in the upper-middle class bracket (with advanced degrees) are the ones who will prosper and succeed. Ethnicity will not entirely matter. Many- or maybe even most -East and South Asian immigrants will make far more money than do middle class or poor whites. And in any case, white racism is rapidly dying. (As Kaplan points out in Vancouver, white men *do* like Asian women.)<br />The city is also dead. This is an observation of Kaplan’s that I can verify just by looking out my window. (I live in Pittsburgh:after seven at night this city’s downtown section is utterly deserted. Few people live here, and even fewer live here by choice. Middle-class and wealthier workers flee for the suburbs. Eventually the city’s taxes on business are going to drive businesses out to the suburbs.) Across the country, communities are springing up around the black hole that is the city. Thus, the spider-web of little autonomous communities outside of St. Louis that Kaplan saw is hardly unique. Everyone wants to preserve their independence from urban mismanagement. Nobody wants to commute anymore either, which is why the quasi-urban business districts in Orange County are so important as well. The growth of industrial parks will eviscerate cities. <br />What is interesting is to see is how Kaplan grapples with where America is going. Kaplan is a classical realist who believes that ancient history is the clearest indication of where a society is going. Throughout his travels in the Near East Kaplan refers to ancient historians like Livy and Herodotus and to classical works of history like Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” to chart the future path of the nation he is in. The problem with America is that our history is without a paradigm to fall back on. Kaplan refers to Gibbon a few times in the text, but mostly I get the sense that he ignores the past and believes that history, here in the Americas, is still being written. Kaplan envisions North America as a massive region of free trade, movement of peoples, immigration, wealth and prosperity with regional city-states that form the hub of American enterprise. To that end, Kaplan envisions America in the next century as being a loose Confederation than a closely controlling Federal government. The old rules don’t apply because America is a young country. Second and third generation immigrants from Asia and Latin America hardly consider themselves as citizens of China or Mexico as their parents might. They are Americans. <br />One of the things that I love about Kaplan’s books is the wealth of little-known information that he gives the reader. I found the chapter on the tensions between the Hopi and Navajo in the Balkanization of Arizona to be fascinating. Kaplan’s keen eye picked it out, remembering tensions between the Serbians and Croatians in Yugoslavia and comparing them to the Hopi and Navajo. Is he correct? Maybe. Maybe the Hopi and Navajo have more in common than Kaplan thinks, but at the same time, maybe the people who look at the Hopi and the Navajo and see “Indians” without seeing the distinctions between their cultures are the ones who are wrong. <br />In general I found Kaplan’s cultural observations rang true. America is getting more multi-cultural and our national identity is becoming internationalized. E.g.: My parents in suburban Philadelphia recently got an upscale grocery store that heavily features ethnic foods from France, Germany, Thailand, etc. That sort of thing didn’t exist a decade ago, or even five years ago, but it is the wave of the future because Americans are hardly nationalist in their culture. Americans want to embrace the outside world and make it a part of our own.  Inter-marriage of the sort Kaplan observed in Vancouver between whites and Asians is progressively more and more a part of America’s cultural mosaic and will ultimately make us a stronger and more cohesive nation. America’s paranoia about immigration from Mexico in the 1990s and our post-9/11 fear of Middle Eastern immigrants is both silly and ultimately destructive to America. Immigrations built America into the colossus it is, and immigration will continue to maintain America as a powerhouse. <br />Out of all of Kaplan’s books, I found this one to be the most different and the most interesting. Kaplan’s keen eye sees a new and different America. I highly recommend.	2003-08-15

A Terrific Book	Iâve been eagerly reading Kaplanâs sociopolitical musings in the pages of âThe Atlantic Monthlyâ for the last three years. Kaplan, a self-described âclassical realistâ, blends his impressive knowledge of history with a cold, dispassionate eye when looking at the world. While Kaplan has written about the United States and Mexico (I highly recommend his excellent âAn Empire Wildernessâ), his typical focus is on the East rather than the West.<br />In âEastward to Tartaryâ, Kaplan seeks to write about the Near East: the Balkans, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the Caucasus, and finally Central Asia, an area the Victorian British called âTartaryâ. (The book was published in 2000, but I believe that Kaplan wrote much of it in the Fall of 1998 and then in the Spring of 1999.) <br />Kaplan has long been critical of the post-Cold War consensus that believed that the world was getting smaller and smaller and safer and safer thanks to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the spread of globalization. To Kaplan, ethnic and religious rivalries are being exacerbated by globalization and are making the world a far more dangerous place. Indeed, ethnic rivalries and religion defeated Marxism, and (may) prove to have a more staying power than capitalism. âEastwardâ contains some proof to buttress these arguments, as Kaplan travels to countries and interacts with the local citizenry, many of whom are angry and xenophobic, some of whom have simply given up hope of a better life. Stability, Kaplan shows, is typically not met by economic liberalization and western investment. One astute example Kaplan presents is the failure of Orthodox churches, which were not bulwarks of the democratic opposition to communism like the Catholic Churches in Poland and Hungary, to bring stability. Without the root of belief that the Catholic Churches bring (encouraging people to see God in themselves, as opposed to Orthodoxy seeing God in the church and nowhere else), these Eastern Christian states have largely stagnated and declined. It is a fascinating little example likely ignored by Western observers.<br />All of this is mostly new information to Americans because we (mostly) live in a postmodern society that embraces cosmopolitan/international values over ethnicity and religion. Kaplan feels that because the media is a thoroughly cosmopolitan class- worldly and affluent â\\"they largely ignore these trends. I think he has a point. âEastward to Tartaryâ performs the valuable lesson of educating Americans about these forces at work in the two regions of the world that are going to occupy American attention for the next decade and beyond: Central Asia and the Middle East. Most Americans donât have any sort of notion of the types of ethnic and religious forces that swirl in Syria or Romania or Azerbaijan. <br />Kaplanâs chapter on Syria and Lebanon are well worth the price of the book alone. When the media starts talking about Syria today they present the country as a unified Muslim state full of tyranny that supports terrorism. In other words, Syria is the basic equivalent of Iraq. However, Syria is fascinatingly different, thanks to the multitude of ethnic rivalries that engulf the nation. Before I read this book I had never really even heard of the Alawiites, the ethnic group to which the ruling elite and many members of the Armyâs officer corps belongs. Their success and control of the Syrian army is important and astutely understood by Kaplan.<br />The development of the city of Beirut in Lebanon is also a vastly under-reported development. A prosperous state like Lebanon, with a growing middle class, could have huge implications for the Middle East. Who would have known about these things? The media doesnât bother to tell us. Thank goodness Kaplan does.<br />Another example of unknown information is Kaplanâs sojourn through the Balkans. Little is known about Europeâs âThird Worldâ, but its importance looms large, as Kaplan shows because of the imminent admission of Bulgaria and Romania to NATO and the EU. These states will form an important part of the new world: providing the U.S. and NATO forward bases to the Middle East (I would note that- though it was ignored by the media â\\"Romania provided the U.S. valuable support in the Second Gulf War), and moving Europe eastward. The stark differences between Hungary and Romania are interesting to consider because one has to wonder if absorbing these nations will harm the EU economically and politically. Kaplan astutely points out that the EU is far more important an entity than NATO because the EU deals with regulations, taxes and laws, whereas NATO is rapidly becoming an irrelevant entity.<br />Readers of The Atlantic Monthly can see portions of articles Kaplan had written for the Atlantic about Israel, Bulgaria, Romania and the Caucasus reappear, but there is *plenty* of new material and Kaplan provides it with uncanny insight. Those who read travel books expecting pleasant stories about artistic and cultural journeys will be disappointed because there is little pleasant about the places Kaplan goes to, and Kaplanâs writing bent is clearly geo-political rather than social. He observes these nations not as a college-age back-backer, but as a quasi-insider: his books are read in particular by the military, to whom he often lectures. Typically Kaplan is assessing the stability of this part of the world and considers the prospects for investment by western corporations and possible western military intervention. Those who enjoy his work will not be disappointed. Kaplanâs writing style is journalistic, with an eye towards classical history. To Kaplan it is here in the East, more than anyplace else, where the past holds the key to the future. Still, Kaplan appreciates the physical surroundings and gives his reader a vivid description of theworld he sees: the hot and dusty deserts of Turkmenistan, the green Mountains of Georgia, and the dark forests of Romania. All-in-all, reading this book is a worthwhile trip.	2003-08-06

Even people who are bored by history's \\"who\\", \\"what\\", \\"when\\", \\"where\\", \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" are intrigued by \\"what if\\" of history. It is a lot of fun to argue about what *might* have happened. What if America lost the Revolutionary War? What if Germany won World War II? (The subject of Robert Harris' outstanding \\"Fatherland\\".) What if JFK hadn't been assassinated? There are numerous scenarios that are possible. Alternate history/timelines are frequently the subject of movies and TV shows. The number of \\"Star Trek\\" episodes devoted to changes in the timeline are simply too numerous to count. Alternate history makes a fun parlor game.<br /> Harry Turtledove is the master of Alternate History novels. His \\"Guns of the South\\" is a classic and his Worldwar series about aliens invading the Earth during World War II is well-read by fans. After reading his \\"The Great War: American Front\\", I picked up \\"How Few Remain\\" to read how the Great War series began. (I was introduced to Turtledove's work when I saw the cover of \\"The Great War: American Front\\", showing the U.S. Capitol Building shrouded in smoke while soldiers fought nearby. I was intrigued by the image, as I was working as an intern on Capitol Hill at the time.)<br /> In a nutshell, \\"How Few Remain\\" and the corresponding Great War and American Empire series posit the same question: what if the South had won the Civil War in 1862? What would the world be like? The answer is intriguing to read.<br /> As \\"How Few Remains\\" opens in 1881, the Confederacy is an independent state consisting of the eleven states that succeeded in 1861 as well as Kentucky and Cuba. Confederate President James Longstreet decides to buy two Mexican states, which prompts the United States, led by President James G. Blaine, to declare war. The two states would give the Confederacy a link to the Pacific Ocean. The war begins . . . While the Confederacy inflicts bloody defeats on the United States in the West and in theCity of Louisville, the United States must put down a revolt in Mormon Utah and deal with attacks from British-controlled Canada . . .<br /> In contrast to the book's sequel, Turtledove's \\"How Few Remain\\" has a much more unified and coherent story-line. The sequel reads too much as disjointed episodes. You never get a sense about what is actually going on. \\"How Few Remain\\" has a terrific story. The characters are well-written and the action crackles. In the ensuing war a number of figures from history make cameos: Theodore Roosevelt, Frederick Douglass, Stonewall Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Jeb Stuart, etc. I found Turtledove's treatment of Col. George Armstrong Custer to be the best of the book. Custer really comes across as an interesting and entertaining character. <br /> My sole criticism of the plot is Turtledove's explanatory prose. A character will say something and Turtledove must insert an explanation for why this is such an ironic comment or why it foreshadows a future event. It may make the book more readable, but it makes the narrative flow too unwieldy.<br /> On the balance, \\"How Few Remain\\" is a terrific book. I can't wait to see where Turtledove takes his readers next in the saga.	2002-08-03

Remember how delicious it was? How it melted in your mouth and how you never wanted the experience of eating it to end? Remember that experience when you pick up Richard Ben Cramer's 'What It Takes&quot;. This is the literary desert that feels like it melts in your mouth as your read: a beautiful, lyrical tale about the lives of six candidates for President in 1988.<br />It is hard to describe Cramer's writing style. He seems to have an uncanny knack for getting into his subject's mind and giving you a vision of the world from their perspective. He seems to find what makes his subject unique and showcase it to the world. His Sports Illustrated piece on Cal Ripken, Jr.'s consecutive games streak in September of 1995 remains the finest article I have ever read in SI since I began subscribing back in 1989. Cramer's style of writing is a joy to read. You simply never want him to stop writing, even if it is about something as mundane as observing Bush traveling to a speech.<br />Needless to say Bob Dole emerges as the hero of Cramer's work. (During the '96 campaign Cramer later released a separate book with just the Dole chapters.) The wounded veteran comes across as a man of stunning drive, courage and loneliness. You can't help but think of the horrific pain and suffering he endured during those years rehabilitating himself and attending law school. The Dole of Cramer's book is easy to admire and quite likeable, despite his gruff demeanor and occasionally cold treatment of people around him. <br />Gary Hart, in contrast, comes across poorly. (Surprise, surprise.) So much of his portion of the book is devoted to attacking the media and refuting his public persona as either an odd loner or a serial adulterer. Hart's hardscrabble life in rural Oklahoma and journey to Yale divinity school gets pushed aside. There seems to be a huge gap between Hart leaving divinity school for politics in 1960 and his role as George McGovern'scampaign manager in 1972 that Cramer doesn't explain. <br />George Bush takes it on the chin too. Our 41st President and the winner of the 1988 contest was probably the least qualified of the six to run. Bush comes across as a likeable guy (and a hero during World War II), but no leader. While Dole is tested on the campaign trail and works hard to master the machinery of the U.S. Senate, while Dukakis is weathering fierce political storms patching together Massachusetts runaway budget, while Biden loses his wife in a car accident and nearly dies of a brain aneurysm, Bush seems to sail through adversity by relying on his resume to get plum jobs (CIA director, chairman of the RNC, ambassador to the UN and to China). Bush's charmed life and patrician view of the world hurt his reelection campaign four years later when he didn't appreciate the suffering his citizens were enduring during the recession the way a Bob Dole would have. Dole seems to have learned, through his experiences, that life is hard and people need a helping hand. Bush, in contrast, seems to have learned from his life that a smile, a handshake, a spiffy resume and knowing the CEO of a Fortune 500 company will get you far. <br />What of Biden, Dukakis and Gephardt? Joe Biden, the Senator from Delaware, comes across as a real leader. Elected in an upset at the age of 29, the Senator suffered terrible heartache losing his wife in a car accident after the election. You cannot help but sympathize and feel for him as he struggled to put his family together again and to take responsibility for the poor choices he made as a law student at Syracuse University in the 1960s. After Dole, I found Biden's story to be the most compelling.<br />Dukakis? Gephardt? I think both men come across the same, as smart,  driven, intelligent guys. The theme of Gephardt's chapters is that he has been and always will be an Eagle Scout: smart, popular with his peers and elders, a success in everything. In other words, Gephardt was the guy from from school your parents wanted you to be like in middle school. Dukakis comes across as even more flawless, more driven and more sure of himself. Dukakis, in other words, was the guy from high school that graduated with a 3.9 and still thought he could do better. Both men had to tough out difficult obstacles in their lives, however.<br />In the final analysis, this is a book you simply do not want to end. Cramer plays no favorites and gives all six men resolutely fair treatment. This is easily one of the three greatest books I have read in my life. (Along with &quot;Thank You For Smoking&quot; by Christopher Buckley and &quot;Truman&quot; by David McCullough). This book is the literary equivalent of desert.	2002-07-07

(I listen to books on tape while I drive to and from my apartment in Pittsburgh to visit my parents' home in suburban Philadelphia. Try driving through Central Pennsylvania for five hours by yourself listening to the regional country music station.)When evaluating a book on tape one must not only evaluate the quality of the writing but the structure of the story and quality of the narrator's voice.  Audio books are abridged and often result in baffling versions that delete the best parts of the book for no discernable reason. Putnam's audio version of &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, for example, I found to be a terrible adaptation, Clancy's editors having dropped huge portions of the novel in favor of a quick thumbnail sketch of the story. Putnam's adaptation of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; was a good deal better. They preserved the story well and wisely chose Martin Sheen to lend his voice. Likewise, I found David McCullough's &quot;Truman&quot; to be a very enjoyable book- excellent structure to the story of Truman's life, an outstanding decision to have the author himself read, etc. &quot;Truman&quot; is the gold-standard for audio books for me. What of McCullough's latest effort?<br />Readers of McCullough's book will be happy to know that much of the book is preserved in part by the unusually long running time of 9 hours (typically audio books are just 5 or 6 hours). Edward Herrmann was ideal choice for narrator. His deep, crisp voice is a pleasure to listen to. <br />Adams himself was an interesting biography subject for McCullough: one of the key leaders of the Revolution, a deep thinker and a voracious reader, and one of America's most powerful politicians in the Post-Revolution era. Part of the boomlet of books on our Founding Fathers, McCullough presents Adams as one of the key figures in the movement towards independence. I am unsure that Adams quite deserves the distinction.  (As an aside: with all of the books being written about Jefferson and Adams and Hamilton I'm perplexed that nobody of McCullough's stature has bothered to write a biography of George Washington. The father of our nation is sadly under-valued by historians and the public.) Jefferson, a man the author clearly despises, is probably the most important Founding Father in my opinion. Adams Presidency was markedly less successful than that of his predecessor or his successor. His contribution to the drafting of the Declaration of Independence is debatable. To put him before Jefferson or Washington makes scant sense to me.<br />That said, the tape is enormously interesting. I particularly found the passages discussing the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence to be a fascinating portrait of life in America circa 1776. Adams role in creating the American Navy is an interesting tale. Helping all of this is that Adams (in contrast to the cold, distant and somewhat duplicitous Jefferson) is an easy person to like: witty, charming, warm, full of character.<br />On the balance, I found &quot;John Adams&quot; to be quite enjoyable. Not as good as &quot;Truman&quot;, yet still an enjoyable book to listen to.	2002-07-07

I suspect this question is what has been driving the proliferation in books on our founding fathers over the last few years. \\"American Sphinx\\", the author's subsequent \\"Founding Brothers\\" and David McCullough's recent biography of John Adams are all part of a larger trend to examine our identity as a country by looking at the men who created this nation some 226 years ago. You could even throw in Mel Gibson's film \\"The Patriot\\" as an effort to explore our nation's creation by Hollywood. (With all of the films on the Civil War, World War II and Vietnam, one would think that the Revolution would be ripe for Hollywood.) After 9/11 I suspect this interest to explore the birth of our nation has been enhanced by criticism at home (by a shrill minority) and abroad of America as an imperialist power. If you want to start by examining the soul of America start with Thomas Jefferson.<br />I found \\"American Sphinx\\" to be an outstanding biography of our third President, drafter of the Declaration of Independence, first Secretary of State, tireless inventor, voracious reader and Virginia landowner. Complicated, brilliant, troubled, Jefferson might be one of the most interesting human beings to have ever lived. Ellis does a magnificent job exploring Jefferson's faults and abilities without resorting to hero-worship. In particular, I enjoyed how Ellis broke up the narrative of Jefferson's life to particular focal points: Philadelphia, Paris, his Presidency, his retirement, etc. The focus on how these times in Jefferson's life impacted him and show what sort of man he was is a welcome relief to a more exhaustive biography.<br />One factor that continually impressed me about Ellis work is his treatment of the Sally Hemmings question. Our obsession with sex and the personal lives of our leaders (a focus thankfully on the wane these days) has led Jefferson's accomplishments to be marginalized by the odious speculation about whether or not he fathered children with Hemmings, a slave in his household. Mercifully, unlike the PC warriors who want to strip Jefferson of his standing in history (despite the murky historical evidence), Ellis is resolutely fair. He presents the evidence that the liaison did and did not exist and reflects about the meaning of the controversy.<br />Thankfully, \\"American Sphinx\\" isn't 400+ pages of Hemmings material. It isn't dull either. This isn't the standard \\"President X signed the bill at a Rose Garden Ceremony on_____\\"-biography. Ellis has a keen sense of prose and has a knack for highlighting Jefferson's life and translating his thoughts and feelings to people 200 years later. Jefferson's grand vision of an America of rural farmers seems so vivid and powerful thanks to Ellis' writing. Unlike our current President, who seems to take pride in his limited intellectual capacity, Jefferson was an astonishingly intelligent and well-read man even for his day, when men prided themselves on their intellect. I think that people will gain a better sense of what a brilliant and original thinker Jefferson was after reading \\"American Sphinx\\". The Louisiana Purchase, for example, was a bold and aggressive decision that did more to end European dominance in the Western Hemisphere and make America into the leviathan it is today than any other decision made by any President since. Jefferson's bold thinking shows what bold, innovative thinkers our founding fathers were compared to their risk-adverse, poll-driven contemporaries. None more so than Jefferson.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the story of our past.ered children with Hemmings, a slave in his household.

US	50827115	RPRNF44CQTF4Y	0425158632	506174805	Executive Orders (A Jack Ryan Novel)	Books	1	10	21	N	N	Yeetch	When I began reading Tom Clancy's books I was enthralled with the author's exciting plots- my summers were usually devoted to reading and re-reading his books as I'd imagine myself in the thick of the action. Since Clancy  wrote 1991's &quot;The Sum Of All Fears&quot;, his books have become  longer, duller and less interesting. I found &quot;Executive Orders&quot;  to be his worst work to date.   The slow meandering plot is pretty hard  to follow- not because it's so complicated. It's not. The problem is that  the plot takes so much time getting going that you lose interest as Clancy  positions the pieces one-by-one. The actual plot is pretty derivative of  all of Clancy's other books, so the ending isn't much of a surprise. The  most basic problem with Clancy's work is in his characters. Clancy  obviously envisions Ryan to be a blue-collar everyman, just one that  slipped into the White House through extraordinary circumstances. Much is  made by the author of his hero's status as an &quot;independent&quot;. It's  too bad that Ryan comes across, consistently, as a doctrinaire,  by-the-numbers, straight out of the pages of The National Review,  conservative. Clancy, who has always been injecting his right-of-center  politics into his books (though more obviously and stridently of late),  puts his politics out in front here. &quot;Executive Orders&quot; is more  politics than policy. Clancy is on his soapbox and the plot too often gets  shuffled to the back for President Ryan to give some loopy tirade about  liberal &quot;special interests&quot; (and there aren't conservative  ones?). First clue that non-conservatives won't be given equal time: the  book is dedicated to Ronald Reagan, who &quot;won the Cold War&quot;  according to Clancy. Give me a break. Too bad Clancy couldn't have made his  case without his hero's preachy speeches. After hearing Ryan's 1,314th  speech informing another character he &quot;is not a politician!&quot; the  reader will want to yell back: &quot;Then shut up already!&quot; The  character of Jack Ryan has always been a difficult one to judge- heroic by  far in Clancy's other novels, Ryan makes the transition from preachy,  sanctimonious hero to preachy, sanctimonious jerk in this novel. A Tom  Clancy novel hits you hard and fast and the action takes your breath away,  but when the plot slows down and we try to get character moments they  sometimes seem painfully forced. Clancy characters are written like post-it  notes: this is the Good Guy who is a conservative/soldier/CIA analyst, etc.  This is the Bad Guy/Girl who is a liberal/Russian spy/terrorist/feminist,  etc. Can you really tell me how much different the characters of Jack Ryan  and John Clark are from one another, aside from their names and character  histories? Not a whole heck of a lot. I'm sure Clancy thinks he's giving  America the kind of leader (read: conservative) they want in this book, but  Ryan comes across as a breezy, &quot;I'm-doing-the-right-thing and people  will see that&quot; conservative whose politics and style bear a striking  resemblance to Newt Gingrich. The old Goldwater-for-President slogan  &quot;In your heart you know he's right&quot;, is a favorite dream of  conservatives and Clancy relies on it here. Why does the subplot with the  &quot;mountain men&quot; militia group fizzle out so spectacularly?  Probably because Clancy can't bring himself to make people whose political  viewpoint he sympathizes with the bad guys.   In the end the reader  will sigh with relief when he or she finishes this monstrosity. I did. My  advice to you, don't even pick this one up.	2000-06-17

The soldiers who fought in this unit saw  nearly the entire war in Europe- the Normandy invasion, to the ferocious  fighting of Operation Market-Garden (the Allies risky strike into Holland),  to the Battle of the Bulge, to the collapse of the German Army in April of  1945.<br />Fans of military history will find Ambrose's book illuminating.

US	50827115	R3HU25PQKG5VNJ	0316930164	838798147	All too Human	Books	3	4	9	N	N	Well . . .	I approached George Stephanopoulos' &quot;All Too Human&quot; with a certain amount of curiousity. A friend of mine and I who occupy different poles of the Democratic Party's ideological spectrum (I the more  conservative, she the more liberal) had given the book a glowing review and  I wondered how I would look at it. When I finished I came to a few  conclusions. I rather like Stephanopoulos's narrative style- he's honest  and forthright about his beliefs and attitudes. I also found his cynicism  about the political process was something I could empathize with, given my  own disgust for the way 30-second attack ads and slick one-liners have  turned politics less into a forum for discussing policy than a war without  end.<br />The problem with Stephanopoulos's outlook is that his point-of-view  is fundamentally at odds not only with the prevailing wind of the country,  but also of Clinton himself. Clinton promised in his presidential campaign  to be a different kind of Democrat, more attuned to the concerns and causes  of the middle class than his predecessors, a pledge that attracted moderate  Democrats like myself to his banner. His first two years in office felt,  more than anything else, like a betrayal of that promise. From  Stephanopoulos's perspective, Clinton's first two years were more about the  failure of communications: Clinton lost not because he had sold out on his  campaign promises, but because he failed to communicate his message to the  people. From Stephanopoulos's perspective the failure of the  administration's communications caused caused Clinton to turn right. From  my perspective, it was where Bill Clinton always should have been.<br />What  contribution does he make to the understanding of the Clinton White House?  Pretty much nil. Okay, Dick Morris is pure slime, but those who follow  politics already knew that. Morris's own memoirs do more to convey the  man's cynicism and lack of morality than any tirade Stephanopoulos can come  up with.There is a certain tinge of jealousy and sour grapes to  Stephanopoulos axe-grinding: his rival Morris is evil, like we didn't know  *that* already. Democrats like Oklahoma Congressman Dave McCurdy, who an  lost election bid in 1994 and blamed his loss on the liberal tilt advisors  like Stephanopoulos gave the Administration, is just bitter. His hatred of  McCurdy, who he accused of treachery when he voted against the 1993 budget,  stems from his belief that McCurdy was jealous of Clinton. From McCurdy's  perspective (see Bob Woodward's &quot;The Agenda&quot;), the  Administration's budget had failed and wasn't worth voting for.<br />It must  be mystifying to such a committed liberal as Stephanopoulos that someone  might disagree with him over the course of the Democratic Party, but Dave  McCurdy did then and so do I now. One could certainly argue that the  Administration's failure to keep to the center path politically in 1993 and  1994 did more to hasten the end of liberalism than Dick Morris ever  did.<br />In the end your ideological stripe will go far to determining how  much you like this book. If you're a dyed-in-the-wool liberal you'll love  it, and if you're a conservative you'll hate it. Myself? I thought it was  okay, but found much to disagree with.	2000-06-17

Thank goodness for David Halberstam, who shatters the myths of the decade with an intriguing look at everything from Marilyn  Monroe to McDonald's to the Cold War. Life in the Fifties was hardly  idyllic for poor blacks in the south oppressed by segregation. There was  lots of rebellion, lots of discontent. It's all here, but what really  impresses the reader is how deeply Halberstam dives into each subject and  gets the story- the inner turmoil of America's nuclear program, the efforts  of blacks to fight racism in the south, etc. Lovers of history won't be  disappointed by David Halberstam's work.	2000-06-17

I read it in the spring of 1991 and within the space of three months quickly devoured all six of the novels he had published. Over time as my tastes evolved, I found  Clancy's characters to be one-dimensional and repetitious, and his right  wing politicizing (which has gotten worse since &quot;Sum Of All  Fears&quot;) to be downright insulting. But still, &quot;Red October&quot;  is an enjoyable book. <br />The plot hinges around the defection of a senior  Soviet submarine captain (Ramius) commanding the newest and most advanced  sub ever build by the USSR, the Red October. While Ramius' crew maneuver  their way to freedom, their former comrades hunt them and the American  fleet maneuvers in an attempt to facilitate the Red October's defection.  Key is a CIA operative who is heading up the effort to help Ramius to  freedom, Jack Ryan.<br />Clancy's skills as a writer become apparent here- the  action is thrilling, the characters aren't. The difference between Good Guy  A and Good Guy B are their names. In terms of personalities or thoughts or  motives, each Good Guy character and each Bad Guy character blends into one  another. Still, the plot is exciting and Clancy obviously gave a lot of  thought to this story.<br />Enjoy.	2000-03-18

It is a sport that is as old as America (as the reader learns on page 272 of &quot;Bunts&quot;), and as much a part of the American experience as anything.  &quot;Bunts&quot;, a collection of George F. Will's columns about baseball  over the last thirty years, is a marvelous look at baseball from the eyes  of the die-hard Chicago Cubs fan. Though I care not for Will's conservative  mindset, I appreciate his prose and enjoy some of his takes on baseball.  Some of Will's contentions are controversial (the game is better today than  ever before), some well-reasoned (the glories of 1950s baseball were not so  glorious) and some out-dated (one column mocking the Braves and Yankees,  baseball's worst teams according to Will, looks hopelessly out-dated since  these two behemoths have won four of the last five World Series). But Will  puts himself out in front and you must give him credit for speaking his  mind. <br />Incidentally, the reviewer's particular favorite column is Will's  1991 look at baseball in the Windy City- &quot;Chicago Baseball- 'Never A  Lovely So Real'&quot; (pages 171-180)<br />Baseball fans will enjoy.	2000-02-09

(I had the latest Grisham waiting in the wings.) How interesting can a book about  economics be? Answer- my Grisham never got read. I couldn't put this  down.<br />Typically economic treatises are uniformly dull, the author  spending pages re-stating his thesis, over and over and over.  As one of my  college professors told me, economists have two basic rules-<br />1) The  market can decide best. 2) Anyone who questions rule #1 is a communist.<br />I  would add a third-<br />3) bore the reader with technical jargon.<br />Krugman,  mercifully, avoids these traps. He distills economics down to its most  basic elements in plain English. Krugman is also a more critical thinker  than most of his counterparts, carefully making the argument for Keynesian  economics and debunking the myths of Reaganomics. Even the most ardent free  market enthusiast will find it difficult to explain away Krugman's notes  about wealth distribution during the 1980s (the rich got richer, the poor  got poorer) and about the disastrous effects of Reagan overseas.  Protectionists will have difficulty as well in refuting Krugman's analysis  of the disastrous effects of tariff barriers and the insignificance of  America's trade deficit.<br />The author has it all correct- the fallacy of  protectionism (the strategic traders), the failure of Reaganomics, the  positive role government can play in American economic life. What makes  &quot;Peddling Prosperity&quot; such a good book is Krugman's skill in  translating his thoughts into passages a reader without a Phd can  understand. Good work.	2000-02-09

I passionately love books about baseball-  David Halberstam's &quot;October 1964&quot; being the favorite of the  genre. I liked Will's 1998 follow up to this book, which was published in  1990. But I did not like &quot;Men At Work&quot;. Here's why-<br />&quot;Men  At Work&quot; reads like a tech manual. Hit, run, pitch, field. Okay fine,  but when one distills baseball into such an exact science the passion  leaves the game. &quot;Men At Work&quot; makes baseball into a game of  economics- put in pitcher W against hitter X because he has a Y-to-Z ratio  between his groundball outs and flyball outs . . . This is not why I love  baseball.<br />Also, after a while Will's observations become redundant.  George we spent fifty pages learning about the strategy employed by Tony  Gwynn in hitting, why do we have to read twenty pages recapitulating the  same things from Wade Boggs? <br />If you want to read a good baseball book,  read &quot;October 1964&quot; or &quot;Bunts&quot;.

William Tecumseh Sherman was one of the great figures of the Civil War, a visionary whose views on tactics and strategy reshaped the way observers looked at warfare. It's hard not to admire the touchy, angry general.  Sherman's armies marched hundreds, if not thousands, of miles across the  south, devastated the south's ability to make war, and defeated tens of  thousands of Confederate troops. His strategy for the Atlanta campaign and  his March to the Sea were brilliant. Few Civil War generals appreciated the  destructive power of weaponry of the era, or realized that total warfare  was the only way to vanquish the South and end the war. After the war  Sherman angrily fought off attempts to draft him into political life,  remaining true to his ideals as a soldier. <br />But it is hard to reconcile  the brilliant general with his racist views on African-Americans and his  prickly personality that alienated as many people who respected Sherman's  keen sense of warfare. &quot;A Soldier's Passion For Order&quot; makes that  attempt and does it quite well. Those interested in learning about the most  complex of the Civil War Generals would do well to read this book.	2000-02-03

History of the Civil War has devoted much to the campaigns of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and those of General Ulysses S. Grant. Indeed, their epic showdown in 1864 seems as close to an American  version of The Illiad as anything in history. But the campaigns of the  west- Sherman's March to the Sea, Thomas's victory in the battle of  Nashville, and the campaign to capture Atlanta are three of the most  under-discussed elements of the Civil War.<br />It is of the latter event that  author Albert Castel has elected to write about. The Atlanta campaign was  filled with some of the most brilliant and interesting minds of the Civil  War- General William Tecumseh Sherman (commander of the Union's armies in  the west) was one of the most complex generals of the Civil War. General  George Thomas (commander of the Army of the Cumberland) was a stoic  Virginian whose skill helped his troops escape from traps time and again.  General John Logan brilliantly stepped into the breach to rally the Union  Army of the Tennessee after its commander was killed. The battle for the  city, a tough campaign that took all summer long, featured skillful  maneuvering on both sides and a tragic series of mistakes which cost the  Southern army control of the city. In the end, the capture of Atlanta was  the deathknell of the Confederacy. <br />Castel does a good job writing about  the battle and the participants. Civil War buffs won't be disapointed.	2000-01-22

At the front of this effort is Doris Kearns  Goodwin's &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot;, a wonderful study of the  partnership between Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor during World  War II, and the role the two played in preparing America to fight WWII and  to prosper in the peace that would follow.<br />That FDR was a brilliant  President, there is no doubt. He survived reverses which would have crushed  a lesser man and displayed a stunning grasp of knowledge as to what people  were capable of. His creation of the Lend-Lease program, by which America  loaned weapons and supplies to the beleaguered Allies in exchange for  repayment in kind, was example of his genius. A wonderfully creative plan  to immediately supply England and Russia with desperately needed help by  creating a plan that junked the unfeasible loans discussed by American  policymakers.<br />That Eleanor Roosevelt was an extraordinary First Lady, a  woman who had survived heartbreaking tragedies to carve out a new and  extraordinary role for herself, there is no doubt. Goodwin does an  outstanding job looking at FDR and ER's roles in one another's lives and  uncovering interesting portraits of the two which give the reader a  revealing glimpse into what these two were really like.<br />Outstanding book.	2000-01-22

People can and  should be better to one another, Bobby argued. Government should help the  people, he said, but only if those people could help themselves. As a  Democrat, I admire Bobby's argument for help, partnership and  responsibility between the people and their government.  <br />Professor Hilty  has done an excellent job. There are things about Bobby that are difficult  to reconcile- why he worked for McCarthy is a good question -and Professor  Hilty does a wonderful job writing about them and explaining them. He  should be congradulated. I, for one, cannot wait for his next volume about  RFK's life.	2000-01-22

Good book.	&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; author Winston Groom turned his talents towards non-fiction to write this tale about the climatic battle of Nashville.<br />The events of the Nashville campaign aren't known much in  history- General John Bell Hood's Confederate Army of the Tennessee moved  north in the winter of 1864 in an attempt to threaten the supply line for  the armies of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman, leaving  behind troops under the command of General George Thomas to face off with  Hood's beleaguered soldiers, moved south across Georgia. Hood's troops  suffered through the winter and were soundly defeated in battle when Thomas  decided to move his army out to fight. The Battle of Nashville and  Sherman's march through Georgia were the crippling blows that dramatically  ended the Civil War.<br />Groom does a good job telling the story with more of  an eye towards narrative than towards analysis. Quite readable, very good  tale.	2000-01-22

Franklin D. Roosevelt? Personally, I give the edge to FDR (the only President elected to four consecutive terms, FDR restored  American faith in capitalism during the Great Depression and then led  America to victory in the Second World War. The legacy of WWII and his New  Deal are still acutely felt over a half-century after his death), but  Lincoln was a close second.<br />David Herbert Donald's &quot;Lincoln&quot;  will no doubt put some more grist on the mill for historians to argue  about. Documenting Lincoln's career from his days as a lawyer in rural  Illinois to his entry into politics to his Presidency, Donald does an  excellent job discussing the factors that influenced Lincoln's life and  made him the man that he was. Readers casually acquainted with Lincoln's  life will be surprised to learn about Lincoln's disastrous term as a  Congressman, or some of the difficulties he faced as President with a  cabinet filled with men who thought they should be sitting in the Oval  Office instead of their boss.<br />A first-rate book about a first-rate  President.	2000-01-22

Harry Turtledove is probably the acknowledged master of alternate history fiction today. His &quot;Guns of the South&quot; is a classic of the genre and more recently he has turned his attention towards an interesting  alternate time-line: what would the First World War have been like if the  South had won the Civil War? The answer is &quot;The Great War: American  Front&quot;, as exciting and interesting a book as I have ever read.<br />In  Turtledove's scenario, the South won the Civil War, then emerged victorious  in the Second Mexican War, which saw a humbled US lose to the combined  power of the CS and England. As the Great War begins, the United States is  allied with Germany (and presumably Austria-Hungary, though this is not  mentioned) while the Confederate States are allied with the triple powers-  England, France and Russia (with Japan thrown in for good measure).  <br />Historically, the addition of the US to the German/Austrian side would  have dramatically tilted the balance of power against the triple powers.  Not only would they have been deprived of American armies which contributed  to the winning of the war against Germany, but England must now also  contend with the American invasion of Canada and the presence of the  American navy on the high seas. Indeed, it was American soldiers who helped  to save the beleaguered armies of England and France in the pivotal days of  1918, when the German army came perilously close to capturing Paris and  perhaps winning the war.<br />The events of &quot;The Great War: American  Front&quot; are quite plausible as well. Slaves in the CS, whose position  is quite like that of the serfs of Russia in 1914, take to reading Marx.  The US must quell a Mormon uprising in Utah. Poison gas is used to break  the stalemate in Kentucky . . . all events that are quite plausible and  dramatically told in Turtledove's excellent prose. The First World War was  the great upheavel of Europe's old political and social order. The effect  in America might have been similar. The reader must give Turtledove kudos  for taking the might-have-beens of the story and making them feel like they  did actually happen.<br />As good as Turtledove's work is, &quot;The Great  War: American Front&quot; has some weaknesses. For one, there are far too  many characters. Do we really need two different perspectives on the U.S.  occupation of Canada? Do we really need so many looks at the war in the  trenches? Sometimes characters tend to blend together, or they take time  away from another whose story you may want to follow more closely. Also,  this reader would have enjoyed longer looks at the naval aspects of this  war. Historically, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in naval affairs was such  to suggest that the U.S. Navy in 1914 would have been a formidable fighting  force, quite the equal of the Royal Navy. The peeks at the naval dimensions  of the war Turtledove grants his readers are too slight for my  taste.<br />This reader would also enjoy a longer look at the political  implications of the war. The US has a two-party system divided between the  Democrats and Socialists. I would love to see how Turtledove might portray  this at work. CSA President Woodrow Wilson and USA President Theodore  Roosevelt make little more than cameo appearances, leaving the reader to  wonder what the decision-making process of the two respective governments  is actually like. <br />On the balance: a magnificent book. I can hardly wait  to find out what happens next.	2000-01-14

As a first year law student I am required to take a class on Civil Procedure, which deals with the mechanics of civil litigation, at my school. Like many schools, mine is using Harr's &quot;A Civil Action&quot;  to show students how the civil process works. Why? Because it is such a  rare thing indeed to see a book so completely immerse the reader into the  world of lawsuits and litigation.<br />&quot;A Civil Action&quot; deals with a  lawsuit filed by eight families in Woburn, Massachusetts against two  powerful corporations, WR Grace and Beatrice Foods. The ensuing battle,  which lasted for years, was a brutal affair for both sides. The lawyers on  both sides worked long and hard to represent their clients. The outcome  pleased few involved, prompting questions about the adequacy of our legal  system. <br />Harr is a journalist, so many of the legal complexities of the  case are lost on him. However as a narrative &quot;A Civil Action&quot; is  brilliant. As a law student I throughly enjoyed the fact that the reader  was able to go so deeply into a world that I myself will hopefully join one  day.<br />On the balance, a pretty darn good book.	2000-01-12

European history is to many Americans an impenetrable subject- much too much information with little idea as to how it all fits together. Europe is an attempt to fill that  void, which it tries and yet ultimately fails to succeed.<br />The main  problem is author Davies Poland-centric view of European history. Poland is  an interesting land with a rich history, fair enough. Yet, time and again  the pages of Europe keep returning to this land of people continually  invaded and conquered. What is happening in Spain during the Inquisition?  In England during the Magna Carta? Surely not anything of consequence  compared to the events in Poland!<br />Another failure of the book is its  sidebars, an excellent innovation for conveying information to the reader  on smaller, less consequential facets of history. Yet the sidebars are  almost all uniformly dull, telling the reader little of interest.<br />No  doubt an attempt to follow in the footsteps of other great historians,  Davies aims high and comes up short. The history of Europe is long and  involves much to tell. Too bad this book, for all of its length, never  really tells us anything.	2000-01-06

In the  end the family disappeared from the public eye, but its legacy remains and  their story is the subject of Peter Collier and David Horowitz The  Roosevelts. <br />The Oyster Bay Roosevelts of TR and the Hyde Park Roosevelts  of FDR are the focus of Collier and Horowitz book. Both families produced a  President, and neither family succeeded in expanding this initial success  into a political dynasty. Horowitz and Collier get the story of both  families. The interaction between the two in the years after TR's death is  of particular interest.

In  the fall of 1965 Moore's 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment engaged  North Vietnamese soldiers at Ia Drang.<br />The Battle for Ia Drang showed for  the first time the steep cost American soldiers would pay in their  engagements with the vietnamese communists and set into play a frustrating  pattern that would persist until the end of the war- American units would  inflict heavy casualties upon the communist forces, but the enemy would  simply slip away into the underbrush, leaving behind nothing but dead  Americans and an empty jungle.<br />&quot;We Were Soldiers Once . . . And  Young&quot; is Moore and reporter Joseph Galloway's account of the 1st  Cavalry Division's initial deployment to Vietnam and America's first combat  actions with the North Vietnamese Army.

The lessons learned by Moore and his troops would have  served American decision-makers well.<br />&quot;We Were Soldiers Once . . .

Clinton's attempt, probably the most  dramatic attempt at a government program since the Great Society, failed  miserably and helped to elect a Republican Congress. <br />The battle the  voters didn't see was the important one- the battle which nearly sank the  Clinton Presidency and destroyed its ambitious health care proposal. The  powers arrayed against the Clinton plan were formidable and well-financed,  aided by the Administration's mind-numbing blunders.<br />&quot;The  System&quot; has the entire story- the high hopes, the stunning reversals,  the industry's toxic reaction to reform. The Clintonites quickly found that  the old adage is true.

Some baseball seasons are more important than others- the 1941 season saw the twin feats of Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak and Ted Williams .406 batting average, the 1951 season saw the incredible comeback of the  New York Giants and Robby Thomson's miracle home run, and the 1964 season  saw the final decline and fall of the New York Yankees.<br />The 1949 season  is a special one for baseball as well. The New York Yankees, poised to  begin their glory years, would square off with a talented Boston Red Sox  team and defeat it in dramatic style thanks to the heroics of an injured  Joe DiMaggio.<br />Summer of '49 is David Halberstam's story of that  astounding season. More than a simple account of the season's wins and  losses, Halberstam delves deep into the background of the players and  coaches. The picture that comes into focus is a fascinating look at the way  baseball was played in the 1940s and 50s, when players (many of whom had  grown up on small farms in the Great Depression) fought hard to win and  played every day as if it were their last. While not quite as interesting  as his &quot;October 1964&quot;, Halberstam has nevertheless written a  wonderfully exciting account of what baseball was like over a half century  ago.<br />This is a book that will make any baseball enthusiast smile.	2000-01-06

Theodore Roosevelt is one of my idols- a President who didn't need a war to prove his greatness. TR was a President who dramatically and forever redefined the role of the chief executive in the political process. TR was  a President who seemed larger than life somehow. A sickly child, TR was the  son of a prominent New Yorker who he lost his wife after she gave birth to  their child and fled to North Dakota to become a rancher after having  served in the New York State Assembly. He returned to politics to  unsuccessfully run for Mayor of New York City, and then became U.S. Civil  Service Commissioner, New York City's Police Commissioner, Under Secretary  of the Navy, hero of the Spanish-American War, Governor of New York, and  then Vice-President and President in 1901. After his Presidency TR explored  Africa and South America (nearly losing his life in the process), and then  returned to launch one of the most successful third-party Presidential  candidacies in history in 1912. Finally he died in 1919, after having lived  a life that others can only dream of.<br />David McCullough and Edmund Morris  both wrote excellent biographies of TR's early life, but finding a good  one-volume story of TR's entire life is a rare thing. Thankfully H.W.  Brands is up to the task. He covers all of the bases and includes  information about the time and places that shaped Roosevelt's life. Like  McCollough, Brands aims more for an informative look at TR's life than a  narrative.<br />Those who admire TR as I do will be quite satisfied with this  book.	2000-01-06

Taking a break from contemporary politics Phillips has, at first glance, written a book about  three wars- the English Civil War, the American Revolution and the American  Civil War. However, &quot;The Cousins Wars&quot; reads less like a  scholarly analysis of English and American history than a graduate  student's thesis.<br />And what a thesis! Phillips looks at the political  implications and makes a startling argument- that these three wars are  little more than a continuation of one another, a contest between Catholics  and Protestants, a contest between loyalists and revolutionaries, a contest  between south and north.<br />Phillips evidence is strong- the towns and  communities which opposed the King in the English Civil War and sent  colonists to the new world also tended to oppose the King in the  Revolution, and wanted to maintain America during the American Civil War.  If all politics is local, as Tip O'Neill said, than the battlelines of  these three wars were always drawn by local matters: religion, economics,  and geography. Thus these wars led to the triumph of the Anglo-Saxon world  of England and America, which has in turn been a blessing upon the world  today.<br />I heartily agree with this assessment. Phillips has a political  opinion to make, and it is a refreshingly new one compared with the  virulent Marxism that permeates much of contemporary academia.	2000-01-06

Like the tobacco industry and the conspiracy obsessed alien abduction movement, Christopher Buckley has always picked targets that deserve ridicule for their pompous self-absorption and their lack of contact with  reality. Those self-serving political memoirs that politicians write after  leaving office or their jobs were a natural target for Buckley's poisoned  pen. The White House Mess is a letter perfect parody of the fictional  Thomas N. Tucker administration from the perspective of his Assistant,  Herbert Wadlough. <br />Anyone who reads memoirs will recognize the usual  things- the vivid remembrances of petty turf battles, self-serving  recollections of conversations where they believe their input was the  decisive factor, etc. Buckley tosses in a hilarious series of crisis for  the Tucker Administration to wallow over, and equally inept administration  officials to mock. The scary thing is that the Tucker Administration bears  a striking resemblance to the first year of the Clinton Administration.  Oddly prescient for a book written in 1986.<br />Fans of Christopher Buckley  will not be disappointed.	2000-01-06

Unlike his more famous novels, this is not a contemporary exploration of people making  their way in a society which punishes them for the choices they made so  long ago.<br />The place is Havana, Cuba. The time is 1898. Set against the  backdrop of the Spanish-American War, a group of Americans are trying to  survive the soldiers of Cuba's Spanish regime and pull off a heist against  a wealthy Cuban landowner.<br />The themes of Leonard's novel are the same- a  heist to part a fool with his money, Americans dealing with the legacy of  poor choices, the system against the heros. But the change here is the time  of the story, and Leonard really shines in giving the readers a vision of  what Cuba was like at the end of the 19th Century. The reader can almost  feel the humidity of Havana, the sound of music from the city, the sights  and sounds of 1898 Cuba pulsating through Leonard's prose. <br />The  characters are dependably interesting, if a little familiar at the same  time. Leonard's prose is excellent as usual, and the story never flags or  fails to hold the reader's interest. Very good work.	2000-01-06

Thanks to TV shows and movies like The X-Files and Independence Day, public fascination with conspiracies and aliens has probably never been stronger.

Abducted, Banion becomes a believer in the  abduction cause and fights to expose the government's complicity in the  abduction conspiracy. From politics to the media to the conspiracy-theory  ridden alien abduction movement, Buckley's targets for ridicule richly  deserve his wrath.<br />&quot;Little Green Men&quot; isn't quite the laughfest  of &quot;Thank You For Smoking&quot;, but it is still a richly entertaining  book that will entertain admirers of Buckley to no end.	2000-01-06

William Tecumseh Sherman was quite right- war is hell. The soldiers who went to Europe in World War II to defeat Nazi Germany lived it- climbing the beaches of Normandy, across the fields of France, through the bitter  snows of the Ardennes, all the way into the heart of Germany. Stephen  Ambrose &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot; is the story of those soldiers who won  the war and freed Western Europe from Nazi tyranny. Beginning on the day  after D-Day, June 7th, 1944, and continuing until the German surrender on  May 7th, 1945, Ambrose gives the story of the war across Europe from the  perspective of the foot soldier, not the great collection of generals  immortalized after the war. This is a brilliant book this reader could not  put down.<br />The war to end all wars was anything but a triumphant march  across western Europe. It was a bloody conflict in which American soldiers,  many boys fresh off the farm or out of the city who had seen a shot fired  in anger before, had to learn how to fight for the first time. Mistakes  were many. Friendly fire was a common occurrence. Frostbite caused as many  casualties as German rifle fire. American officers, eager to engage their  German opponents and leading their men from remote headquarters miles away  from the action, often launched foolish or unusually aggressive attacks  that resulted in tremendous casualties. This mindset often clashed with  that of British officers, whose care and concern for the well-being of  their men was born out of the terrible cost suffered by the British Army in  the fields of France during World War I.<br />One of the more particularly  stunning parts of &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot; is a chart on pages 280-283  which break down the casualties each U.S. Infantry and Armored Division  suffered as a percentage of their original total when the Division entered  combat. The three U.S. Divisions that entered the war on D-Day- the 1st,  4th and 29th Infantry Divisions -suffered 206%, 252%, and 204% casualties  through the course of the European campaign. Think about that for a moment.  In all three the original members of the division were killed, wounded or  captured, then their replacements were all killed, wounded or captured,  which necessitated a second group of replacements to fill out the division.  Though casualties were not as dramatic for most of the other U.S. Divisions  involved in Europe, many lost over 100% of their original members. If you  were a rifleman in one of the divisions that landed in Normandy on June  6th, 1944 or began the war shortly thereafter, the chances that you made it  out of the war unscathed were virtually nil.<br />Rarely do simple numbers  convey such startling conclusions.<br />Ambrose has done an excellent job  collecting interesting stories that were representative of the millions of  soldiers who went to Europe to fight and sometimes die so that the world  may be free. Anyone who reads Citizen Soldiers will be impressed not only  by the terrible sacrifices made by American GIs, but by their courage and  their heroism in the face of such a terrible ordeal. This is an outstanding  book.	2000-01-06

Fine. 1960's Liberalism was a  disaster for Americas cities, particularly New York, Washington &amp; Los  Angeles.

This  book is angry, and the author's anger perhaps serves a dual purpose- to  showcase how angry moderate, suburban Democrats (such as this reviewer) are  at how urban liberals led the party astray, and to mirror the anger and  contempt these liberals felt towards their critics.<br />Good message. Uneven  delivery.	2000-01-06

The American experience today seems, all too often, full of divisiveness and distrust. I've heard my elders complain that today's youth seem too self-absorbed and have it too soft. Hard work, sacrifice and personal  responsibility seem to be forgotten values. Younger Americans wonder why  their grandparents are so critical. If all members of my generation sat  down and read Tom Brokaw's &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, I wonder  how much cross-generational strife would be cleared up in the  process.<br />The World War II generation was probably the greatest generation  America has yet produced. They journeyed across the seas to defeat Germany  and Japan. But the work they did in the war is only half of the story. When  these veterans returned home they went to college on the GI Bill (a  government program of such far-reaching success that not even the most  ardent anti-government conservative can dispute that government does  right), and rebuilt a Depression-ravaged America. They raised a new  generation of Americans, and fought what President John F. Kennedy called  &quot;the long twilight struggle&quot; between capitalism &amp; freedom,  and communism &amp; repression that was the cold war. <br />Anyone who reads  Brokaw's book will come away with a profound sense of admiration for the  sacrifices and hard work their elders made to fight the evil that  threatened the free world over the last fifty years. &quot;The Greatest  Generation&quot; reads almost as a companion to &quot;Citizen  Soldiers&quot;, Stephen Ambrose's first-rate look at the soldiers who went  off to fight World War II. It is doubtful that anyone who reads either book  will walk away disappointed.	2000-01-06

Elmore Leonard has a real ear for dialogue and for writing interesting, complex characters that might seem like average, everyday people at first glance. Small wonder Hollywood has chosen to adapt so many of his projects  to the big screen (&quot;Out of Sight&quot;, &quot;Get Shorty&quot;) and  television (&quot;Maximum Bob&quot;).<br />Rum Punch is the story of Jackie  Burke, a stewardess looking at the twilight of her life and becomes  involved in an ATF sting directed at gun-dealer Ordell Robbie. The ensuing  scramble to clear her name and swindle Ordell out of some money dominates  the story, as does her relationship with bailbondsman Max Cherry. Director  Quentin Tarantino made a decent film based on the book called &quot;Jackie  Brown&quot;, but to truly appreciate Leonard's story and the characters in  them one has to read the book.	2000-01-06

Dreadnought is a very big book about a very big subject, the origins of World War I. The consequences of which were, needless to say, complicated and diverse for the road to the great war can never really be exactly  determined. For example, a plausible argument may be made that the seeds of  WWI were laid when the Roman Empire ended some 1,500 years ago.<br />(The  origins of World War II, in contrast, are somewhat less complicated- the  Treaty of Versailles being the predominate cause of the greatest war  mankind has ever fought.)<br />Author Robert Massie tries, and generally  succeeds, in telling us about the events and personalities that  precipitated the conflict. The isolationism of Great Britain, the rise of  Imperial Germany, the ins and outs of pre-war British politics, etc. The  heart of the book is Massie's description of the Dreadnought program- the  brainchild of Admiral Jack Fisher -which was an attempt to build a  battleship that would revolutionize naval combat and keep England safe from  invasion. Instead, the Dreadnought kicked off an arms race between England  and Germany that contributed mightily to WWI. <br />Massie is, to say the  least, a through historian. Everything is in here that could have played  even the slightest role in bringing about the conflict. One senses that  there is indeed too much information here. How important really was the  political dispute over Imperial Preference, a proposal which would have  given tariff preferences to British colonies over other imports, to the  causing of the First World War? It is a fascinating tale, perhaps worthy of  its own book, but hardly of great consequence here.<br />However, one cannot  fault Massies thoroughness or prose, for Dreadnought is a readable book  that is probably the definitive work on the cause of the First World War.  Outstanding. A book that any student of history can be very enthusiastic  about.	2000-01-06

For many a baseball  enthusiast, this is a timely reminder that baseball is not merely a sport  or pastime. It is a business. A writer for The Wall Street Journal,  Heylar's prose is efficient and businesslike. The subject could be a dull  one, but Heylar navigates it with confidence and gives the reader an  informative, if dry, look at baseball's finances.	2000-01-06

Baseball has perhaps never had a season of the importance of 1941. In the last year of the American &quot;innocence&quot; before the beginning of World War II, unassailable records were broken and Americans got to see  some of the greatest baseball ever played. It was the season of Joe  DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, Ted Williams astounding .406 batting  average, and the improbable run of the Brooklyn Dodgers to the National  League pennant.<br />The end would be one of the best world series ever, a  series that would see the first of the New York Yankees numerous world  series victories over the Dodgers. Finally, the clouds broke and America  was at war.<br />Author Robert Creamer has done an outstanding job weaving in  tales from his own life and coupling them with observations about the  season as it unfolded. Creamer is a very readable author who gives the  reader an outstanding insight into what life was like in America in 1941.	2000-01-06

A lifelong baseball fan who grew up in a Long Island  suburb of New York City, Goodwin grew up rooting for her father's favorite  team- the Brooklyn Dodgers in what many regard as the golden age of  baseball, the late 1940s and early 1950s. <br />It was an era where the  Dodgers went to six World Series in ten years (1947, 1949, 1952, 1953,  1955, and 1956) and won the title over the hated Yankess in 1955. It was an  era that saw baseball integrated by Jackie Robinson, and some of the best  players in history (Robinson, Duke Snider, Willie Mays, Yogi Berra, Mickey  Mantle, Billy Martin) wowed the fans time and again with their spectacular  play. And Goodwin watched it all while growing up. &quot;Wait Until Next  Year&quot; is as much a memoir of growing up in suburban Long Island in the  1950s as it is a remembrance of what baseball was like in that long-gone  era. <br />Anyone who followed sports as a kid can remember what it was like  to watch their heroes on the television, fervently hoping they may emerge  victorious (this baseball fan was crushed to watch the big, bad Oakland A's  slaughter his heroes, the San Francisco Giants, in the 1989 World Series)  or being so fortunate to actually attend a game in the flesh. This reader  smiled as he read Goodwin's memories of attending a game at Ebbets Field,  her horror at Robby Thomson's miracle home run in the 1951 playoffs that  lifted the Giants over the Dodgers, her satisfaction with the Dodgers  triumph in the 1955 World Series, and finally her sadness at the Dodgers  decision to depart for Los Angeles in 1957.<br />A very good book that even  non-baseball fans will find hard to put down.	2000-01-06

The remarkable praise the book garnered was  well-deserved. Bill Clinton's path to power had all of the elements of high  drama- the tragic hero, noble in his aspirations but flawed in his personal  life; the eclectic mix of supporting characters; and the trials they all  endured.<br />All of it is here, but Primary Colors presents the story in a  fresh way that readers will find interesting.

Morris takes the reader through his life all the way to his assent to the  Presidency. Morris' prose is quite readable. The reader gets a sense, early  on, that this is not your typical biography but something different- a  narrative on the life of a great leader as opposed to a meticulous analysis  of his upbringing.

As I read Senator McCain's book I was reminded, time and again, of amazing parallels between McCain's life and that of Theodore Rosevelt- sons of prominent figures (TR's was a leading member of the Republican Party,  McCain's father and grandfather were both Admirals) who over-came great  tramas in their lives (McCain's 5 years as a POW, TR lost his wife to child  birth) and rose to the top by questioning party orthodoxy (TR broke his  party away from big business and made Republican policies more progressive,  much akin to McCain's desire to reform campaign finance and his commitment  to internationalism). John McCain is a real American hero, a man who has  gone through so much and seems destined to go even further. Reading this  book has certainly had an effect on me- this Democrat is voting for Senator  McCain next year.	1999-12-08

In recent years I've grown tired of Clancy's habit of gratuitously injecting his right-wing opinions (which really slow his books down), his  clunkey, tech-laden prose, and his one-dimensional characters. But I still,  at age 22, have a fondness for Red Storm Rising.<br />The plot is perfect for  Clancy's story-telling skills: WWIII breaks out between NATO and the Warsaw  Pact. The emphasis is on story and action rather than on character and the  story and action are terrific. One gets the sense that this is really how a  Cold War WWIII could have been like. Even the ending is somewhat plausible.  Excellant work.	1999-12-07

When I began to read I braced myself for another of Harold Coyle's dull Clancy clones, yet I found myself enjoying  &quot;The Ten Thousand&quot; immensely. <br />The story- the fanatically  anti-American leader of Germany captures nuclear weapons taken by U.S.  forces from the Ukraine, forcing the U.S. Army's X Corps to fight their way  across a hostile country to recover the weapons - is a welcome change from  the renegade Russia scenarios that authors like Dale Brown cannot break  free from.<br />The historical allusions to Xenephon's Ten Thousand and the  medieval warfare were wonderful for this ex-history major to read. Coyle  clearly put some thought into this story. <br />The only flaws to Coyle's  story are his unrealistic portrayals of the decision-making process in  Washington.	1999-12-04

Why did Clinton really win? The  results of the '94 and '96 contests put Clinton's victory in a somewhat  different prespective.

Admirers of Pat Buchanan will be hard-pressed to defend their hero's latest book, a pro-Hitler tirade that makes the arguement that America was unjustified to go to war with Nazi Germany and should have left Hitler's  legions to roam about Europe.<br />Buchanan's sickening admiration of Hitler,  a man the author has called in the past &quot;a genius&quot; &amp; &quot;a  statesman&quot;, comes through time and again. Perhaps the most disgusting  part of the book is Buchanan's claim that Hitler wanted to be America's  friend, a theory based on Buchanan's interpretation of &quot;Mein  Kampf&quot;. Buchanan, alas, ignores historical tidbits such as Hitler's  &quot;Z Plan&quot;, a construction program of aircraft carriers and  battleships, coupled with the acqusition of air and naval bases in the  Atlantic, was part of a concerted effort to prepare for the war against  America that Hitler wanted to fight.<br />Buchanan's reading of history is all  wrong and his admiration of Hitler makes any decent person sick.

Clancy's heros are dull- one-dimensional over-achievers  who seem like xeroxes of one another. Clancy's villians are worse-  charactures, one-dimensional bad guys. It is as if Clancy is so afraid of  the reader thinking for him or herself he finds it necessary to stack the  deck. Clancy's political sentiments are expressed with the subtlety of a  jack-hammer.
