He constantly makes the distinction between &quot;good service&quot; and doing a &quot;good job&quot;. They are not synonymous and play an important role in helping you when it comes to rain making. <br />This book showed me MANY examples of how to guide and direct new business to the company.

I almost listened to the one negative review of this book. Mr. Clifton is sorely mistaken that the information in this book can be found at the exchanges. His intentions seem honorable, but maybe his level of trading experience is so great that he has forgotten what its like for someone new starting out.<br />My experience with trading has been limited to paper trading and the one time some boiler room broker convinced me that \\"this was going to be coldest winter ever\\" and loaded me up on heating oil options.<br />Both times I received tons of information from the exchanges and most of it was simply confusing.<br />Although this book was short it was chocked full of information that I could use today. I was able to weed out the boiler room brokers from the good brokers. Like the author emphasizes, I was given the use of three tools right away- a trading plan, a trade worksheet, and a trading journal.<br />I have spent $200 on Ken Roberts course, then another $200 on Larry Williams course, and the information that I got ... by buying this book seems to be the last puzzle piece that was missing from both of these expensive courses. <br />This book was well worth the costs and to be truthful I would have paid three times as much for this information.

But they were few or far between. I never saw anyone doing lines while speaking with a client. There were also other unscrupulous behavior. But I only saw this when I inadvertently fell into a \\"boiler room\\".<br />None of this behavior that Trader X discusses can be found in legitimate companies. It makes me wonder what kind of person was he for staying in that type of environment. I left the second week I was there when I saw brokers in the hallways shooting craps.

But in a book so densely packed with ideas this is an important message.<br />One of the best examples of the book is the &quot;lemonade stand&quot; example. Mr.Mitchell takes this classic business, the childhood lemonade stand, and applies many of his principles and ideas, that are expressed in the book, and literally turns it into a well diversified Fortune 1000 conglomerate style company using simple strategic building blocks.<br />At the end of the day I was impressed and found many ideas to improve both my writing style and my business.	2003-06-11

Solid Ideas!	...<br />In Practical Speculation, I once again found Mr. Niederhoffer's humourous attitude at play. He has a style that is both disarming and straight to the point, but can put the most esoteric of concepts in a light you never thought of. <br />In this book he does just that by pointing out that the scientific method needs to be applied and should be applied to investing. And he does so in typical Niederhoffer fashion. He takes the time to deconstruct many of today's investing strongheld beliefs. <br />He rips to shreds Benjamin Grahams value investing and technical analysis for starters. Whether you agree or disagree with his assessments it is important to hear multiple opinions before you formulate your own.<br />Many of his ideas about trading along with Mr.Kenner have a of mathematical models attached to them and they force you to take out the slide rule quite often along with that old calculus book.<br />I liked the book for what it is, two men's vision of what the market means to them. We should all be so lucky to be able to express that from time to time. Don't look to his methods as the holy grail of investing, just as he suggests you shouldn't look to others, and you will like this book too.	2003-05-06

This could have just as easily been entitled &quot;The Zen of Trading&quot;. <br />Mr.Steenbarger sincerely wants you to succeed. He gives you mental exercises and tools to incorporate your personality fully into your trading. <br />I have been involved with futures trading for 11 years. I have been an investor a broker...

Mr. Bernstein has written a solid book, based on his \\"four pillars\\" of investing. They are as follows \\"investment theory\\", \\"historical perspective\\", \\"investor behavioral errors\\", and lastly \\" brokerages et. all don't have a responsibility to their clients.<BR>For those of you coming out of the dotcom fiasco many of you will find that this book will heal some of those wounds. The poor accounting practices, the fraud and deception by both analyst and corporations have all made today's investors sceptical and cynical.<br />Mr.Bernstein will be the guiding light for many of you. His lengthy discussion on investment theory will open your eyes to the various ways to go about investing, and in that respect he borrows a lot from Benjamin Graham's, Warren Buffet's mentor, value investing. Which smoothly leads into his second pillar historical perspective.<br />Mr.Bernstein shows mathematically that over time the stockmarket and the bond market converge until their yields are the same, which is very interesting if you believe that the only way to make money is when the markets go up, I don't.<br />Lastly he lambast brokers and money managers both for their incompetency to beat the indices and for their uncaring attitude to see their clients thrive and prosper.<br />Many of the subjects he discusses in his book will give investors renewed power and strength to attack the investing world again.<br />Where Mr.Bernstein fails is his leaving out the investing theory of non-correlative investment strategies. It's where you invest in different types of investments that have no relation to one another. This type of investing is essential during bear markets.<br />I have been involved with futures as an investor, broker.... It is the only known non-correlative investment to the stock market. It allows investors to still make double and triple digit returns while the stock market is collapsing. From my own experience this the only way I survived the dotcom bubble and it is the only wayI know a lot of investors could have avoided this massacre as well. <br />Mr.Bernstein loses sight of alternative investments and of various other types of money managers outside of just stockbroker et. al. That is my primary criticism, but this book otherwise is sound and solide in its strategy and investment suggestions.	2003-05-05

Mr.McLean and Mr.Eldred have laid bare all of the real estate secrets and like with many things, real estate investing is simple, but not easy.<br />Many real estate gurus will have you believe that the only success you can attain in real estate is by basically ripping off the seller.

This book.<br />I have been involved with futures investing for 11 years. I have been a broker, an investor ...

For all of my professional carreer I have been involved with futures as a broker, investor, and I have authored three books about futures and options ...

She doesn't mince words and has a hard no nonsense attitude. <br />I am a futures broker, investor, and author for the past 11 years. In that time I have realized that although I invest in speculative investments and portion of my portfolio must be maintained conservatively. Unfortunately, stockbrokers and futures brokers, in general, aren't as fiscally responsible as they should be.

It really opened my eyes to the true financial needs of seniors and how I can fill that gap. I have been involved with my branch of financial services (futures, commodities, managed futures, and commodity pools) for the past 11 years. I have written three books on the subject, but I never realized that the group that I most ignored were in dire need of my services. Mr.Klein does a great job of explaining indepth the senior psychology to investing. He also shows you that it is not unscrupulous to communicate the proper message to this very wealthy segment of the population. In fact he does a perfect job of showning the financial professional it is criminal not to make an effort to communicate with these individuals. Don't wait until they die and then help their baby booming children. Roll up your sleeves and help them come up with solutions today for their estate planning, their long term care needs, their income needs, and their capital gains needs.<br />Great book.

I have been a futures and commodities broker and investor for the past 11 years. I have also written three books on the subject. So when a friend of mine suggested I read Carleton Sheets autobiography I was skeptical. Rightly so. I read the book and was disappointed. The title overpromised and the text underdelivered. I really felt I was going to gain some indepth and serious insight into how to invest in real estate and some tips and tricks on what it means to buy no money down. Instead I got a two hour \\"book infomercial\\". The self congratulatory attitude and the constant brow beating of this book is not enough, but buy my several hundred dollar courses or attend one of my several thousand dollar seminars deflates the whole experience.<br />There are other ways to use leverage, I do it everyday using the ideas in my book Futures For Small Speculators, and make money, Mr.Sheets doesn't even show you his way...unless you want to pay extra for one of his seminars.

Unfortunately it will not work for 90% of the people. <br />When I was first introduced to privately held Second Trust Deeds it was as an investment. These Seconds can be as high as 18% or 20%. It's a great way to beat CD's. Unfortunately, these percentages are harder to come by in this easy mortgage environment. Many of the ones available are in neighborhoods that secondary investors would not want to buy in.<br />The other flaw in his logic is selling before you buy. Many holders of these notes want some type of deposit to hold the not why you find a purchaser.<br />Lastly, this is a nickle and dime industry. You are trying to make 2% to 3% differences here and there, sometimes you can sometimes you can't. There is really no way of really fulfilling the promises of the title without working this program full time.<br />I have an investment advisor for 11 years, I focus on futures and commodities, and I have written three books on the subject.

Then to move into the food industry with the same energy was impressive.<br />It is unfortunate that he passed away so suddenly, his value investing was very much right out of Benjamin Grahams school of thinking, and Mr.Lewis definitely had the potential to become the next Mr.Buffett.<br />Great book, it really set the tone for how I will grow my own business.	2003-04-08

This is the most comprehensive books on Fundamental Analysis that I have ever seen. This book along with Schwager's Technical Analysis book are required reading for new futures brokers that I hire to my firm.<br />Mr.Schwager and Mr.Turner have put a very strong mathematical spin on how fundamental analysis can be accomplished. They dissect government trade reports and analyst reports and put an empirical face on the nebulus act of fundamental analysis. <br />In the preface of the book Mr.Schwager admits that fundamental analysis is not quite accurate. Which begs the question, &quot;why write such a complex book?&quot; <br />This book is not for the faint of heart, nor is it light reading. It is quite indepth and for the most part above the heads of many beginning futures investors. In order to understand any of the examples you have to have solid trading reference points in your personal trading life.<br />I recommended it for intermediate traders primarily.<br />After being involved with futures for 11 years and authoring three books on the subject, I am always impressed at Mr.Schwager thoroughness in researching.	2003-04-07

Mr.Dicum and Ms.Luttinger have writtne a phenomenal book. From their obsure historical facts to their pinpointing the origin of coffee, 6th century Ethiopia, you will be riveted to your seat as if you were reading a fictional novel. <br />They put coffee, the coffee industry, and global coffee politics under a microscope and often times it fails to hold up to the scrutiny. No matter what your political affiliation is you can't help but be immediately shocked and awed and the incredible amount of sociopolitical machinations that go on for you to have that morning sip of java.<br />For 11 years I have been a futures investor, broker, and author. One of the preferred futures contracts that I trade is coffee. This book has provided me with an indepth background and perspective on coffee that I never had before. This is now one of my reference books. For those that are interested in investing in coffee either actual grounds or in futures this book is for you and for those that can go a day without the original &quot;liquid gold&quot; you have got to read it. At the end of the day you will appreciate that Starbuck's &quot;venti mocha grande&quot; just a little bit more.	2003-04-04

This is a great book that details the origins of coffee from 6th century Ethiopia to today's Starbucks. On many levels this book succeeds. It has a lot of coffee trivia that is both amusing and thoughtprovoking, it shows how coffee gained its relevance in today's society, and lastly it puts the social and political aspects of coffee under a microscope. <br />For 11 years I have been a futures and commodities investor, broker, and author. One of my favorite futures commodities is coffee. This book has added to my knowledge base by 10 times. I feel I have a deeper understanding and appreciation of java and in the long run I suspect that this will improve my investments in coffee futures. My hat is off to the author. Congrats on a fine book.	2003-04-04

His story did not account for the internet. Therefore, many of the political ideas simply won't appeal to the internet generation, where information is only a fingertip away.<br />On the other hand there are valid points regarding the \\"opiates\\" of life. Unfortunately, when you are young you look at it and say \\"look at what they are doing to us\\", which is what our protagonist does. As you become wiser you begin to see that the statement is really \\"look at what we have done to ourselves\\", which is what he finally discovers when he joins the band of scholars.<br />This is an all time classic, but the reverse is happening in our society. There is too much information and no filters/censorship. So we need to be more alert for misinformation and propaganda, than we have ever needed to before.<br />Own the book.	2003-03-27

With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI, CIA, INS, and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases. They are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system, better not have anything to hide.<br />September 11th accelerated the path that we were already on. I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.<br />After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment. I just hope that these &quot;mistakes, misquotes, and misinformed&quot; changes never occur in such a draconian fashion.<br />Great book. Everyone should have a copy on their shelves.	2003-03-27

With many trading computer programs that will do all of your technical analysis for you. It is good to know the why and wherefores behind the concepts that you are using. This is the Sixth book that I have read by Schwager and I am thoroughly impressed. Many of his books tend to be steeped in high level mathematics and difficult to grasp exactly what point he is trying to make. In this book, there was no such problem. The only part he leaves out is that the Technical Analysis is nothing without discipline. His book ... will give you a well rounded trading experience. I own this book as a reference and so should you.	2003-03-20

This book beats the pants off Mr.Stanley's millionaire next door. He realy goes indepth and extracts what mental, emotional, and support attributes it takes to be wealthy. Being a veteran futures investor, broker, and author for the past 11 years, his book really opened my eyes to the attributes that I have, that have been contributing to my success, and the attributes that I don't have that have sabotaged my trading in the past.<br />I suggest this book to all of my employees and all of my clients. I make sure they realize that what they want is wealth, and if not they should not be involved with trading as a living.<br />I have read this book four times. My copy is dog eared, highlighted, and underlined. What impresses me the most is Mr.Stanley's scientific approach of surveying, and his interpretation of his survey is what shines in his writing. He brings the statistical data to life.<br />I recommend this book a thousand fold to everyone. For stock and futures traders, this book ... you will find yourself far ahead of the pack.	2003-03-18

In my journey I was recommended Ryan Jones's book. In his book he details the various methods of money management, then he exposes their flaws, and finally he presents you with his solution for money management. This is a great book for any student that is serious about his success with futures. Ryan has a friendly approachable style to his writing that engrosses you, even though the information is laden down with statistics and mathematics.<br />It is a nice eye opener to really see how important money management is and how it can work for those that are dedicated and disciplined.<br />Purchasing this book ... will definitely help you keep more money in your pockets.	2003-03-13

At the time I only knew the Nightengale-Conant tape series, but it had a profound impact on my mind and my business. <br />Today, solely because of this book, I have written three financial books of my own and have a successful private investment firm, liverpoolgroup.com, entirely based on the fundamental principles found in Mr. Gerber's books.<br />The reality is that the &quot;franchise prototype&quot; that Mr.Gerber discusses is a fraction of his message. He really shows you how to set aside your fears and seize the brass rings that reside in your ideas. He takes you psychologically from the mundane to the infinite, by opening your eyes to the limitations that you have placed on yourself. <br />He also forces you to confront your value system. This is a brilliant book and is a must have for any person that is contemplating their own business. It is also perfect for those that are in business, but somehow forgot themselves along the way.	2003-03-12

Something like 2 out of 10 seasonal trades work nowadays. Technical Analysis has eliminated many of the seasonal signals. <br />In fact it is prohibited by the National Futures Association for brokers to even discuss or promote on the basis of seasonal trading. That says a lot to me.<br />In the past 11 years I have been a futures broker, futures investor, and author of several futures books and I tell all of my clients not to rely on seasonal trades. And if they do follow seasonal trades use tight stops for when the market goes against you.	2003-03-06

This book is one of a kind. It opens up the world of futures and options perfectly. The author, Mr.Barrie, doesn't hesitate to tell you about your risks potential. He emphasizes it over and over in fact. The only thing he doesn't develop fully is why futures and options are so risky.<br />In my 11 years as a futures investor, broker, and author, I have come to discover that leverage is the criminal that makes futures so risky.

I still kept this book with me and used some of the practical approaches detailed in the book to help my clients trade more successfully.<br />Now after being involved with futures for 11 continuous years as a broker, an investor, and the author of three futures books I still find myself referencing Larry Williams material. <br />Unfortunately, others have a hard time accepting his methodologies and ideas. But if you have read MarketWizard by Schwager, none of those traders were alike. They traded with their own style, with their own risk tolerance, and most importantly with their own goals.<br />That's why Williams' information should be used solely as a base for your own trade development and not as the gospel. Because of the few things mentioned above, and many other personal traits that individual traders bring to the trading experience, there are no \\"futures gurus\\" that can tell you exactly how to trade day to day.<br />So you have to decide for yourself what is most important being told how to trade or discovering how to trade for yourself. That's what this book, my books, and many other books can realistically do for you.<br />Good luck and God's speed.	2003-03-05

So I went to ...pick this book up along with several others. <br />Needless to say the book gave me a framework to train the kids and help their parents and it's making T-Ball an enjoyable experience for all of us.	2003-03-04

In plain language he discusses yield curves and backs up his information with solid charts and graphs.<br />Mr.Cescenzi opens your eyes to the psycology of those that sell bonds and the importance of bonds in your own personal portfolio. <br />Since I am an author of Futures/Commodities books and an investor in Bond Futures, I read this book to enhance my knowledge of bonds and to take advantage of the bond trading pits in Chicago.<br />I believe that's the only failure of the book. He discusses that there are no centralized exchanges for bonds and grossly neglects that many bonds have a futures component and are traded for only a fraction of their face value. <br />All in all this is a great resource book and should be seriously considered for those investors that are tired of being abused by the stock market.	2003-03-04

So many people forget that bond holders are creditors. So that when a company folds, shareholders lose out, but most often times bond holders get paid out. Ms. Cohen pulls no punches and is solid in her review of the bond world. I even like her inclusion of &quot;Bowie&quot; Bonds, the rock and roll bonds that were founded several years ago. <br />In all her talk I found her discussion light on leveraged bonds. Bond futures are also a viable means to enter this fixed income investment. I should know I've been doing it for 11 years.<BR> <BR>That aside this is a one of kind book that no modern investor can do without.	2003-03-04

For eleven years I have been trading futures as an investor and a broker. The three M's that Mr. Elder discusses, Mind Method Money, have been the cornerstone in my trading and the trades of my clients. Mr. Elder's psychology background puts to rest the antiquated &quot;perfect market&quot; theory once and for all by cleary showing the difference between theoretical preparation of traders and their actual actions. This is why everyone seems to get in at the top and out at the bottom, actions and poor psychology. ... Mr. Elder sites the primary issue at stake, discipline. Lack of discipline is the sole reason for money losses.  If you have no other book in your investing library, this is the one you need to have.	2003-03-03

It really attempts to break down the vocabulary for the lay person to understand the concepts.<br />Where it fails is no fault of its own. With the addition of security futures and single stock futures, many of the strategies of picking market direction and synthetics are not as valuable. <br />In order to get most out of a book like this you need to have a second book ... that explains how futures and options can work in tandem.	2003-03-03

I was thoroughly impressed.<br />I had read Schwager Technical books on trading in the past. And although I liked them, I found them to be quite tedious. With his Market Wizards series I was thoroughly impressed. You read the real life accounts of the top traders in the world and all you can say to yourself is I can do it too.<br />In no way does Schwager's voice interfere with the wisdom and message that these top traders try to get across. This is one of the most inspirational financial books of the decade, solely because it doesn't try to inspire, it simply gives the average trader a glimpse of what others call the impossible, beating the market, and the hope that you may be in the next edition.	2003-03-03

I was thoroughly impressed.<br />I had read Schwager Market Wizards books after I had read this Technical books on trading. And although I liked it, I found many of the charts and graphs quite tedious. On the other hand was thoroughly impressed at level of information that was being presented.  This book is a permanent part of my collection solely because it reads more like a college text book than a commercial investment book. He really delves deep and makes you think about what futures really are and what it takes to decipher their movements. I am looking forward to his comments on single stock futures.	2003-03-03

This the first time I have seen such a critical view of the gold manipulation that goes on around the world. The discussions about the goals and the strategies that the IMF uses are worth purchasing the book alone. In some places the writing meanders, but over all any gold bug will find this a valuable resource.	2003-03-03

Risk aversion is becoming a necessity for multinational corporations they are figuring out more and more sophisticated ways to leave the little guy holding the bag. If anything this a book that needs to be read by the average speculator to check out the psychology of their big boy counterparts.<br />The author then takes everything one step further and clearly points out what he thinks of the various strategies that multicorps use. Backhandedly showing you ways to beat them at their own game. Great book.	2003-03-03

The amount of information was not only volumounous but meaty. Reading it made you feel like you were being let into some kind of secret that only the best trader's understood. This book is a classic, but not for the fainthearted. <br />Also as with all books on swing trading and cycles as the market progresses the cycles change. I would love to see a complete revist of Hurst's strategies for today's market. I believe many of the skeptical would be pleasantly surprised.	2003-03-03
