This book, an indepth account of the worst car crash and loss of life in all of motorsports, was fascinating but could have been much, much easier to read.  I originally thought that I was just tired as I first sat down to read, but it was the same thing the next day as I struggled with the author's difficult writing style. Since I consider Le Mans one of a handfull of great races, I really wanted to learn more about the tragedy and the aftermath. The author certainly did his research and the  details, maps and drawings, calculations and photos all helped to bring this event, fifty years back, into sharp focus. A definite plus. I especially loved his explanation of the German, French, British post-war tensions and how it affected the way people formed opinions about racing teams. But I really had to strain to get through some parts because his style and sentence structures are not familiar to me.<br /><br />It's on my motorsports book shelf but I don't think it needs to be on yours unless you too are a motorhead.	2005-10-10

I used to spend a lot of time doing projects in California and spent every free hour in the City by the Bay. Since I have the NYC cards and love them, I figured I would buy these and have them for my next trip. A friend borrowed my set for a recent trip and told me that he followed several cards and found them a great travelling companion. In fact, he said he followed a card to the \\"best view in the City.\\" Can't get much better than that.	2005-10-05

It is set in one of the most interesting and mysterious cities in the world with a complex and equally interesting main character. The plots of each story masterfully intertwine the grit and politics of every day Venice with the day to day challenges of being a police detective. In this story, Brunetti is faced with solving the 2 year mystery of a kidnapping turned murder. Naturally, his insufferable boss, imperious Italian nobility, embarrasing police incompetence (or is it disinterest) and the grinding politics of Italian bureaucracy all challenge our hero's skills as much as the mystery itself. All of this would be forgetable if the book had been written by someone with fewer skills or a heavier hand than Ms. Leon. I especially love her dialogue. The conversations between Brunetti and his wife are tender and realistic. But I really love the way she gives voice to Guido Brunetti's inner thoughts - it makes this, and all of her books, so involving.<br /><br />With so many cookie-cutter mystery series out there (many of which, I admit, I read and enjoy), it is refreshing to read a novel that is both interesting and very well written.<br /><br />Note: Unlike some other mystery serials, this book stands on its own and can be read without having to have completed the prior books in the series to enjoy it.	2005-10-04

I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The main character is someone you can relate to - flawed (meaning human), quick witted, funny, plagued by bouts of self doubt, and throughout it all, she remains a caring individual.<br /><br />I am a fan of travel mysteries and when the travel destination is Italy, I am totally hooked. I try not to look to deeply through the reality lens with books like this. Like the Cat Who series and the alphabet books by Sue Grafton, the fun for me comes from the crisp writing, intricate plot twists, and the challenge of reading subtle clues clever authors have planted along the way.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars? I think that if all of these deaths happened on a fun tour, I would have gone packing for places unknown.  But the author kept me distracted and I hung in until the end, still guessing \\"who dun it?\\"<br /><br />I'll read the rest of the series based on this edition if only to find out if people keep going abroad with a this Typhoid Mary of death and destruction.	2005-09-27

On vacation, he picks up and reads cereal boxes over breakfast. So when he recommended this book, I was skeptical. It sat on my shelf for months and then one day I grabbed it and started reading in the, er, library...  Wow! This is a great read. From the exciting opening right through to the wild finish in NYC, I was hooked. Toward the end, I actually wanted to read slower so the fun wouldn't end. I anxiously waited for the movie but when I saw it, I was really disappointed by the junk they sold as this wonderful, excapist book.

Never any surprises and few disappointments. That is also the appeal of books by prolific authors like MHC. She has believable characters, realistic dialog and a plot that grabs you from the first page.<br /><br />In this book, we confront a medical mystery almost \\"snatched from the headlines.\\" A famous man disapears. His company is investigated for stock fraud and the world believes he's taken off with the loot. There is a nutty serial killer, an unlikable step sister (aren't the always unlikale?) and a crusading reporter. The pace is fast in this audio book and the reader has an interesting voice. There were a few surprises along the way and a few tense moments too with a sniper stalking people - urged on by the voices only he can hear. I always listen in the car and this CD set helped me get through some very long hours on the road.  For fans of MHC, you will not be disappointed. For folks new to this author, this is a very well written story and worth your time.	2005-08-07

I am a sucker for mystery serials. I love Block's Burgler and the Grafton's Alphabet mysteries so I am the right guy to get into a NYC / Coffee / food series. The characters are likable enough without being cartoons. The dialogue is well written and the people each speak in his or her own voice (think about it, most well written books all have that characteristic in common). The killer is a bad, bad guy and obviously nuts; I love that kind of evil doer. And when he sets his sights on a main character, I could feel the excitement build.  The pages turned a little faster too. The action moves along and the author fills in enough local color to make a NYC junkie (like me) happy and it adds another level of interest. (They even took a trip to Queens, for heaven's sake - very unusual.) The way NY's coffee culture is woven into the story works very well for me. NYC used to be a place where weak, bitter coffee was common, even in good restaurants. Now, since the first Starbucks opened over here in the mid-1990's, bad coffee, while it still exists, is getting rare indeed. And local places, like the one described in this story, really exist.  The best have taken the basic Starbucks idea and put a NYC spin on it. The author makes me want seek out a place like the one in the story and hang out with friends with a hot cup of coffee.<br /><br />I look forward to future installments and will now go back and read her earlier books.	2005-08-03

I bought this edition to read on the plane to Europe a few weeks back.  It was a smart choice because it led me to drive from Monaco to San Romolo for a perfectly delicious 6 course lunch. Leon uses the City's heat and the ever-present Italian politics to create a tense and thick atmosphere. The plot - the murder of a decidely unpleasant old women - seems simple enough.  But she is hated by literally everyone so the list of suspects is long. Leon hints at the motive through conversations between the great detective and his wife. But they are subtle and when you \\"get it\\" you realize the depth of Donna Leon's skill. The sub plots always involve Venetian politics, the stupidity of governments and the need to find sanity in small things like a good meal and a decent bottle of wine. This is a perfect fix for those out there addicted to arm-chair travel and murder mysteries.	2005-07-23

My luck - it was the first in the series, \\"Burglars Can't be Choosers.\\"  I was hooked and have read them all.  This latest in the series is a gem.  Bernie continues to be hip, quick of wit, glib and, in general, as nice a crook and you are ever likly to meet. I doubt Block will ever change the \\"formula\\" (no insult intended) since his fans expect nothing less. This issue's plot has enough twists and sub plots to keep you wondering (and interested) and his signature wrap up explains what may have gotten past you. In this edition, I found the closing session in the bar with his partner in crime to be very useful. Block employed a great many characters with odd names (some even came equipped with an alias or two) so summing everything up for me was most appreciated.  I hope there is another Bernie on the way soon but with ten already on the shelf, maybe that's too much to hope for?  If you have never read one of the books in this series, do yourself a favor, jump in with both feet. I like to start at the begining of a series but Block has written each so that you can start anywhere and wind up having a great time along the way.	2005-07-04

Yes, this book does have a few warts probably the result of time pressure, the difficulty in confirming details and simple human error. But it's still one of those \\"must have\\" books that Ferrari fans need on their book shelves.

I pulled out a few cards written about parts of the City I know and love to see if the author knows her stuff. Take card 15 - the Ms. Fay touches the high spots: Abingdon Square, Ottomanelli's, Zito's, Murry's Cheese, Rocco's Pastry and more. Walk these streets led by her map and prose and you'll have a wonderful visit. Flipping through the cards, I think every significant neighborhood has been captured. I know in warmer weather, I'll use a couple of her cards to explore Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens - boroughs that are a lot more of a mystery to me than Manhattan. Naturally, with a map on one side of a 4X5 card, there isn't much room left for text. Having said that, I wish we had more detail about each area - a small complaint. Maybe in V.2.0 some folded cards?<br /><br />I collect anything NYC oriented and I am happy to add this pack of cards to my library but I wondered what the market is for these cards. My guess is that locals will use them to learn about streets outside their sphere. Out of towners will be able to stick one or two in a pocket and stroll through one of the most fascinating cities in the world. If you are a NYC fan, you need to get your copy of City Walks New York.	2005-01-23

To our great shock, this year it was not open for the late lunch we planned (as it has been for years). I was bummed out. Because food is so expensive in New York, I like to have a solid recommendation from a fellow foodie. My wife suggested that I stop in a book store and check for local eateries in Zagats.  They had the new 2005 edition, so I bought it, flipped through the local selections, and found Cafe Edgar (upper west side) for a light, relatively inexpensive lunch with amazing deserts. Here's a rave, the book paid for itself the first time I used it. Bottom line, this is a must-have tool for any New Yorker who eats out on a regular basis. It is written by and for people like you. The reviews are a great jumping off point for additional research - I like comparing Time Out New York reviews against the Zagat short takes. The restaurants are listed in alphabetical order with other cuts by geography, cuisine and more - very useful. Again, with the prices of a NY meal so high, going in a new restaurant blind could result in an expensive, bad meal. And in a city with so many great restaurants, that really is a crime.	2004-11-24

Honestly, I really wanted to like this book. Other books I have listened to by Dan Brown have been a hoot - with well written, tight plots.  But this book (for me) was a confused state of affairs. I guess some folks could buy into anti-matter, a plot to blow up the Vatican, a centuries old secret society run by \\"Arab\\" bad guys (Arabs being easy targets these days) and all manner of cabals in the Papal hierarchy. But when the hero is a 30-40 something college professor who turns out to be a cross between a comic book superhero and James Bond, I checked out. The guy gets shot at, drowned, and thrown out of a helicopter a mile in the air without a parachute and he still saves the day and gets the girl. And, to make matters worse, I figured out the ending by disk 3 and suffered through the soggy wrapup on disk 6.  If I hadn't been driving across a landscape that was less exciting, I might have flipped off the CD. Maybe the unabridged version is better? For me, this one was just too silly to be believed. If you want to read good Sci-fi - try Jack Finney's Time and Again.	2004-11-09

I had high hopes early on as Bad Company starts in Hitler's bunker amid the bombs and bullets of the last days of the war. Higgins paints a desperate, atmospheric word picture of the chaos that existed as fruits of a madman's harvest bring down a country. But as the audio CD moves from the 1940s to modern times, we get a confused, predictable tale, low  on surprises and not much fun (especially the ending). I was disappointed that the good guys were not more likable than the bad guys - especially with Nazis and IRA killers popping up every now and again. Everyone is a crack shot, planting bullets in the brains of people at unbelievable distances while weathering storms and machine gun fire from the enemy. Really laughable. Even harder to swallow was Patrick Macnee's attempt to do German and Italian accents. Maya Got! Atsa no gooda! This is only for die hard Higgings fans - all others can safely pass and know they didn't miss much.	2004-09-23

It is (using a much over used word here) a masterpiece. Strong characters, intricate plot, exquisite detail all grounded in the most exciting place in the world, New York City. What's not to love? I have re-read this book several times. I also have it on tape and play it to get through long car trips - it's an old, reliable, much loved friend. I am fascinated by time travel and I love New York so that probably explains the appeal of this book. I also grew up as a reader (as opposed to a real TV junkie) and I love getting lost in very detailed prose and intricate word pictures - the kind Finney employs here to hook the reader. I can visualize one scene in my mind now - Sy Morley in his rooms in the Dakota, snow falling, the city silent, bathed in white. Is he in the 19th or 20th century? Was the experiment a success or a dismal failure? You have to read on (and will want to read on) to see.	2003-12-16

The Inn had no TV and I had already finished the New York Magazine crossword. What to do? I went to the local bookstore and found this one. I finished the book quickly - a sign of boredom or a good read. Because there are 2 authors, I think the series lacks a real individual personality - I sense the duo had to make compromises in the writing style. They should take turns writing each book and let the chips fall where they may. Anyway, the idea that the CEO of a huge corporation would: 1) - accept an interview from an unknown director and meet on short notice and 2) that the CEO of said corporation would kill someone over ground water contamination from one gas station is laughable. Embarassing, actually. I work for a medium sized corporation and couldn't get to see the \\"big guy\\" if my life depended on it. But I don't want to be too negative. Afterall, the book helped me get through a bad couple of rainy days in Maine so how bad could it be?	2003-07-27

The comments about &quot;too much Zee / Joshua&quot; are fair and I agree with them. This edition had a lot less fishing too, thank you very much. The plot was easy to follow and you probably won't be &quot;guessing&quot; until the end. But this series is designed for summer reading - a time when your mind should be on autopilot. That means, it should be easy. also, it should be fun and it should be atmospheric. I think Mr. Craig knows that and he has hit on a decent formula that he can use (milk?) until he runs completely out of ideas. I'm reading the series now because it's April and it's still snowing here in the NE. I could use a little Vineyard summer right now and the series continues to bring me back to one of the most beautiful places in the USA.

However, that's not the point about these 'atmospheric' novels is it? You read these kind of books while you're on the Cape or to bring you mentally back to the place. This one has a better plot that the others I have read in the series but the dialogue remains the weak point. Enough with the fishing and the traffic jams too, please. All in all, since we go to the Cape every year, this series is a fun read for me. However, if you want read a good series with excellent dialogue and a strong sense of place, find one of the Dibdin novels. They are set in Italy and they are wonderful.	2003-03-16

The wise cracks, the plot, and Kinky's Krazy Kast of Kharacters made that one a hoot - I loved every word. This edition still has the highly irreverent dialogue and nutsy group of irregulars but, still, there was something missing. The basic idea of the passports as McGuffen seemed way too unbelievable to catch and hold me. At any point,  a more reasonable man would have collected them and dropped them on the desk of your local FBI agent. By being too clever in this one (and Kinky is very clever) he lost me and that's too bad. Still, I'll buy the next and next and next and read every one in the hope that Mr. Friedman hasn't run out of good ideas.	2003-03-10

In these frightening times, I found this captivating account of the ugly face of war and the heights good men can reach uplifting. The author, Mr. Sides, masterly weaves the past with the present, bringing the reader from the horrors of the Death March up to the rescue mission's first gun shot. While the author does not engage in a lot of flag waving, I felt proud of the accomplishments of my father's generation - people who fought a desperate fight they never asked for but didn't back away from either. If we still have people in America like the POWs and the Rangers who went into harm's way for them, maybe we still have a chance. Read it yourself and be inspired.	2003-03-07

Like most serial novels, there is a comfortable sameness to every edition that I find charming. Alas, this one was below par but I  enjoyed it nonetheless. As has been mentioned before, this would not be a good starting place to get acquainted with Mr. Q and the cats. Too much prior knowledge is assumed of the reader. As for my criticism of this book, it seemed to have been written to length rather than written to a logical or dramatic conclusion.  At the last page I was left thinking, &quot;Is that all there is?&quot; It almost seemed like it was an abridged version (but it wasn't). I don't want to be too critical of this book and scare off future readers because there are some real gems in the series. (The Cat Who Read Shakespeare hooked me first.) Any fan of light mystery will find hours of pleasure working his or her way through them all. I suggest with this or any other series to start at the first book and move forward through them.	2003-02-22

Despite it's age and crushing population, visitors, residents and even self-styled experts on NYC are always exploring and claiming to have made &quot;discoveries&quot; or unearthed amazing secrets. This book is another example of a book that proves the point. I am happy to report that the author (editor, really) has crafted a book that really has nuggets of knowledge that most readers will find new, interesting or both. Its facts are arranged logically and the writing conveys the passion one feels when exploring an exciting place such as NYC. Without the passion, the book would only be a book of lists. And, because the author has asked his friends to write only about things that they love, each short &quot;secret&quot; narrative is alive with personal insights and opinions - I like that. If you have read this far, I bet you will like the book as well.	2003-01-10

It was a hoot and when I found that it was part of a series, I was hooked. This book-on-tape is (I think) the 4th or 5th in the series and assumes the reader has some key facts about the hero (Mr. Q) and the cats (Ko Ko and YumYum) that play important parts in the narrative. So, although this is considered her &quot;best&quot; book by many critics, it's probably wise to start from the begining of the series and work your way up to this one - it will all make more sense that way. Having said that, this was a fun &quot;read&quot; because the plot is tight and logical and the pace is fast. The Narrator (George Guidall - I hope I got that spelling right) is superb. He plays each voice part well and even brings life to the cats through his theatrical &quot;Yowwwwws&quot;. I especially like the fact that it was unabridged - the more-common &quot;two cassette&quot; offerings cut out a lot of the chatter that makes these books so much fun. Those who have read others in the series will be surprised to find out that Qwill financially quite poor and is worried about making ends meet (something that get's resolved in later books). But the cats are in rare form and despite the money woes, Mr. Q manages to spoil them with food fit for a king and queen. The author (Lillian Jackson Braun) peppers her prose with interesting facts about pottery, food, wine and life. And she manages to bring everything together in the end - tied neatly with string and a bow. I suggest you find the earlier books and get started on a series that has endured for years and will bring you pleasure for years to come.	2002-09-16

Mr. Leavitt tells us about a Florence that you can only experience by living in the city and becoming one with it. He helps get us past the quick bites of the galleries, statues, churches and bridges that most us take during our visits to Florence. Instead, he offers us a feast of detail about the hidden history - recent and past. His is a book about a city whose character and charm is like a lot of interestng people - not what it seems on the surface. I could have done without the section on homosexuals and their lives in Florence. However, he makes a point that the impact of these residents are a part of what makes this city attractive to many in the world. This probably isn't the first book or the only book you should read about Florence, but if you have been there or are going, grab a copy and read it for an eye opening account of one of the world's most beautiful and fascinating cities. Certainly, not light reading but worth the effort.	2002-08-24

I have most of their previous books on regional food and their pages are ketchup, mustard and butter stained with notes scribbled in the margins. When I heard that they wrote another  new and updated version, I ordered one just in time for this summer's 1000 mile New England odyssey, make that vacation. Every recommendation was right on - priced right and exactly as described. This is important to note because I know in their &quot;Eat Your Way Across The USA&quot; release of a few years ago there were many out of date references. (We were disappointed last year in Wisconsin as our search for a Bratwurst joint ended at a boarded up and abandonded store front.) Happily, this one seems to be more current and we have yet to find a dead reference. If you love to eat and love to travel, this is the book for you.	2002-08-18

His close brush with death in Sicily and the passing of his mother have changed him, some how, into a man of decisive action. This rather short novel is split, in my mind, in two parts - before Rome and after. Before, the story revolves around the mystery of murders that seem to be some how tied to Zen. Coincidence? Was he betrayed? Is he being set up by his enemies within the Mafia or maybe even the Police? All of the carefully crafted suspense leads up to a confrontation in the streets - one that gives us our first gimpse of a new Zen, a man capable of physical and well as mental gymnastics. Afterward, he returns to Rome, but instead of reverting to form, he stays that new man. One whose actions are more focused and decisive (at least for him!) The ending is pure Dibdin with more than a few close calls and surprises to keep you turning the pages. But regular readers need not fear these changes. The author remains a master of dialogue and the conversations between Zen and his new love, Gemma, show he has a great ear for not only what people say but how they say it. I only wish the book was a few pages longer (the only reason for 4 stars). At under 200 pages, the end arrives too soon. I wanted more and anxiously await the next installement - I hope it comes before my next trip to Italy!	2002-08-15

I really love mysteries that convey a sense of place. I bought into this series because I thought it would have a strong Italian influence. So far, I have read 2 in the series, and the action seems to take place as much in England as Italy - a minor disappointment. However, Pears does convey the atmosphere of the UK well in his prose and his character development. Mr. Pears is a skilled writer. He has a flair for intricate plots and believable dialogue. This story has a more than a few sub-plots but he manages to tie them all up nicely in the end. I didn't guess every secret along the way and was surprised by the big plot twist at the very end. I especially liked the way he introduced the Italian political inter-office power struggle into the story. He writes about it with such conviction and style that I suspect that he has a mole in Roma! All in all, this was a fun way to spend a few hours. Quite entertaining and that's exactly what it's supposed to be. If you are looking for a more gritty take on Italian crime, read Dibdin's A.Zen series.	2002-08-06

I went to the Zone VI workshop in 1989 and this was &quot;required&quot; reading before attending,for good reason, the instructions really work. This book removes the technical barriers to making a good negative and then a good print. He starts you out by showing you how to establish your proper film speed (ISO). Next, he explains how to expose a negative and properly develop it. And then, he explains how to make a proof sheet (proper proof) so you know if what you saw in the field is what you get in your final print. Finally, he tells you how to make a good print. All very logical. Fred knows how to take the mystery out of what is a fairly technical process and frees you so you can concentrate on making beautiful pictures (the only reason to do all this). In a little over 100 pages, you will learn what must have taken years for Ansel Adams, et al to find out by trial and error. Final point, Fred used to have a rubber stamp in his office that read &quot;TRY IT&quot;. He would stamp it on letters that asked questions like &quot;What happens when...?&quot; His philosophy is simple - reading the book does you no good unless you actually do what it says. I learned a lot from this book and found it to be the most simple and clear set of instructions on the subject. But it wasn't until I made my first negatives and proof sheets and then prints that it all really made sense so &quot;Try it!&quot;	2002-07-26

We used this unabridged audio book to pass the time on a recent trip to Milwaukee.  The plot of The Switch is intricate, well crafted and clever enough to draw you in and keep you guessing right until the end. The sex scenes were a little much and I'm glad we were not travelling with young children. Despite all of the clues (and the title of the book), we were still guessing &quot;who done it&quot; right up 'till the last chapter. The main character - an astronaut named &quot;Chief&quot; - was a bit over the top. I mean, how many of us could name any NASA commander, let alone name one that could inspire groupies and squire women like Elvis? If you enjoy excellent writing, a brisk pace and surprising twists and turns, you will enjoy The Switch.	2001-07-08

We had just checked into our hotel in Verona and needed a good meal to put our spirits back on track. That's when we dug out our little red guide and found a 4 star restaurant within walking distance.  Don't let the fact that it's all written in Italian put you off.  I have no language skills and found it easy to use and quite indispensable. While it's difficult to have a truly bad meal in Italy, with this book it's amazingly simple to have a positively great one.	2001-07-08

You have to really pay attention with Dibdin, but never more so than with this installment in the A. Zen sagas. We find our hero indolent in this southern port town stalked by love, murder, video games and incest. Dibdin takes us on a merry chase and somehow manages to bring it all together in the final (long) chapter. New comers to the Zen mysteries should not start with this book (try the Dead Lagoon) but long time fans will be caught up by the third page. You should read the chapter title translations to get the jokes as they are played out. All in all, a real hoot that captures the atmosphere of Naples today.	2001-03-05

From San Francisco, to New York, to New England, to Germany, they never fail to give me accurate and useful information.  I bought the Green Guide to Italy and it is as chock full of goodies as any of the other half dozen guides I own and love. It is not laid out by region (which is the only reason why I gave just 4 stars), but, instead, by city.  Since I know the alphabet pretty well by now, I got over  my initial disappointment! The guide does a very good job describing the best things to see at all of the major tourist cities - Venice, Rome Florence and Milan. It even gives useful information on smaller, but interesting, cities like Gubbio (a GREAT town to visit).  The size and shape encourages you to carry it along with you and the high quality of the paper and binding means that it will last through several trips. If I could only own one book on Italy, this would probably be it - it was the first I bought.  It doesn't give insights into places to eat or hotels, but there are the red guides...	2001-02-12

It sold back then for about  $12.00 (first editions, no less!) Unfortunately, a full tank of  gas in those days was $2.75 and a bag of White Castle hamburgers  was less than $2.00, so the book was out of reach. And then it went out of print, became a classic and got further out of reach. About 8 years ago, I found a copy in our local library  and finally got a chance to read it - which I did in one sitting. It was like having Mark Donahue sitting next to you spinning some yarns, telling tall tales and explaining &quot;what it's like out there.&quot; I met Mark's son, David, a few years after that at a Porsche club meeting and asked if he had a copy of the book to sell! He told me he didn't even have one for himself.  He did say that there was talk of doing a reprint and lucky for us, it has happened. If you want to relive one of the most exciting periods in racing (with remarkable insights into the growth of the Roger Penske juggernaught), by all means get yourself a copy of this book. I just received the soft cover version and it's a keeper. Another wonderful racing book is Sterling Moss's - &quot;All But My Life.&quot;	2000-12-30

By luck, I found Dead Lagoon and I feel my choice couldn't have been better. The main character, Aurelio Zen, is like the city herself - gritty, complex, flawed but still fascinating. I also found myself thinking that I don't like a lot of things about this guy. But like a car crash on the side of the road, I found it impossible to look away. I had to see how things worked themselves out. I especially enjoyed the way the politics of Italian bureaucracy colors nearly every one of his moves - it's almost like it's another character. I admit reading it from a hotel room on the Grand Canal has probably influenced my review, but I still recommend it because talented writers like Dibdin need to be encouraged to keep working at their craft.	2000-06-22

If you have a lot of knowledge of this marque's history, you should enjoy the pictures (I shot many of them for the Author!)

Sure, there are some factual errors in this 900+ page book, but that doesn't detract from its value or  from the fun you will have reading it.  The author has structured the  chapters like they were stand-alone magazine articles - you can jump into  any one and start reliving the excitement. Porsche fans - especially those  new the marque - should go get a copy, find a nice chair in good light and  begin to learn all about this great car company. If you love German cars,  Ludvigsen has also written some great books on Mercedes.<br /><br />More good news - Mr. Ludvigsen has released a completely revised \\"Excellence\\" - Excellence redux, as it were. Bigger, more color, heavier and filled with facts and figures on Porsches built after he completed the first release. A lot has happend since version 1 so the huge size makes sense. But it's not just about size - Ludvigsen still has the ability to captured the essence of Porsche-ness better than anyone. In my opinion, this continues to be the must-have Porsche book and it should be on every automotive enthusiast's book shelf (But you better make sure that it's a sturdy shelf first!).	1999-11-23

The trip to Mexico is a great tale and it's worth reading the book just for that. There isn't quite as much energy or pure joy in this book as the first, but it's still a hoot. I suspect that we will see a volume 3 of the tales of Buddy, Big Ed, and the rest of the crowd - natch - and I'll probably buy it and enjoy it too - no lie!<br />September '02 Update! BS Levy is at it again. The third edition is out - I picked up a copy yesterday (Labor Day) at Lime Rock Park and will read it this weekend. It's called \\"The Fabulous Trashwagon\\" and I can't wait!	1999-10-26
