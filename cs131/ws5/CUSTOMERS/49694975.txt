Liberty or Greatness?	This is a wonderful book, clear, concise, logical and properly infuriating for anyone concerned about the current state of the nation.<br /><br /> It's based on a simple premise:  liberals believe government authority, policies and incentives have guided America's destiny into greatness.  The neoconservative rebuttal is that America's destiny is based on not meddling in the lives of ciizens and not becoming involved in foreign nation building.<br /><br /> Wolfe doesn't endorse the neoconservative view.  He writes, \\"As it takes the personal courage of a Teddy Roosevelt or a John McCain to become a great American leader, itr takes intellectual courage to propose great ideas for Amerca, such as the courage to insist that sometimes government is necessary and the taxes to finance its activities a small price to pay for the results it can achieve or the courage to do what is right for future generations rather than what is most likely to garner votes in the very next election.\\"<br /><br /> It's based on an assumption that people are either basically evil or good.  Liberals believe in basic goodness;  conservatives believe in basic evil and punishment to instill respect and morality.  Wolfe writes \\"The hope-filled language of the Reagan and Kennedy administrations finds no place among men like Vice President Dick Cheney, who are convinced that forces of darkness rule the world and must be met head-on with iron resolve.  Suspicion and fear guide this administration, not confidence and generosity.\\"<br /><br /> True enough.  Do you trust the government?  If so, this book outlines in chilling detail the intellectual underpinnings of how and why the Bush administration wants to reverse almost everything the US government has achieved since 1860.<br /><br /> If you don't trust the government, this book outlines heart-warming reasons of how and why \\"Bush is the first Republican president to make libertarianism the centerpiece of his presidency.\\"  The express goal of massive budget and trade deficits is to make sure the US \\"is unlikely to possess for decades the financial wherewithal to achieve any of the objectives its leaders set out to realize.\\"<br /><br /> To understand this antiu-government attitude, it's worth understanding the \\"Old Confederacy\\" was born the moment Gen. Robert E. Lee offered his sword to Gen. U.S. Grant at Appomattox;  thus began the legend of states' rights.  As Wolfe explains, \\"A hundred years ago, Southerners voted overwhelmingly for a party that stood against the idea of a strong America.  Now they continue to do exactly that.\\"<br /><br /> The result, Wolfe writes, is \\"the stronger American conservativism becomes, the weaker America will be.\\"  In this wonderfully liberal view of conservative ideas, a strong state dominates and controls its citizens, taxing them heavily to finance its domestic experiments, foreign adventures and imperial greatness.  Does the powerful national unity and sense of purpose implied by the slogal \\"Ein volk, ein reich, ein fuhrer\\" ring a bell?<br /><br /> It's been said of John Milton, who wrote 'Paradise Lost' to praise God and condemn Satan, that he inadvertently created a heroic Devil because of Milton emphasized his very human insistence on individuality instead of meek submission to God.<br /><br /> In  his praise of America, Wolfe likewise writes, \\"Greatness, which has always been the exception rather than the rule in the American experience, must be willed into being over the objections of all those forces that benefit from the individualistic culture, decentralized political structure, and profit-seeking opportunities that dominate everyday American life.\\"  Take your choice  . . . .  individuality or greatness.<br /><br /> It puts Wolfe right up there with Milton.f massive budget and trade deficits is to make sure the US \\"is unlikely to possess for decades the financial wherewithal to achieve any of the objectives its leaders set out to realize.\\" <br /> <br /> To understand this antiu-government attitude, it's worth understanding the \\"Old Confederacy\\" was born the moment Gen.

This attitude, widely expressed during Paine's life in England, was the intellectual foundation of his ideas and those of the 13 Colonies.  The combination of the science, industry and social upheaval opened an entirely new world of analysis, opportunity and freedom in England.<br /><br /> However, even today as in the 1770s, although England is among the world's most technologically advanced societies, there is an inordinate fondness for tradition.  The endless fascination with \\"the Royals\\" is an example;  Americans avidly follow the Royals on the basis \\"this is where we came from\\" while the English still believe \\"this is who we are.\\"<br /><br /> While Liell presents an admirable nuts-and-bolts story of \\"Common Sense\\", he fails to explain why it was such a dramatic springboard for Americans into independence rather than remaining a mere civil war as was the case in England's \\"Glorious Revolution\\".  Even now, this difference creates the great misunderstanding between America and \\"Old Europe\\".<br /><br /> The Americans of Paine's day weren't illiterate backwoods bumpkins;  they were their ancestors loved Shakespeare, Milton and Chaucer.  However, having left their homeland far behind, Americans  --  like the Australians, unlike the Canadians  --  would trust the future to make their ideals come true.  Liell doesn't seem to appreciate this difference.<br /><br /> Yet, the book is worth reading.  He offers enough biography of Paine to realize his strong personal conviction of individual liberty that was smothered in England could blossom in America and almost lead him to the guillotine in revolutionary France.  Paine was \\"preaching to the choir\\" in a sense, but he did the equivalent of writing the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic' for people who were eager to sing.<br /><br /> More than anything, it is a reminder of how a few chosen words have the power to incite a mob of violence  --  or, in this case, a people to greatness.  It's as true today as in 1776;  the outcome all depends on the cause and the words.  For an current example, think of the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and what might have been the outcome had the emphasis not been on a recurring fear of another similar attack.<br /><br /> This book is more relevant today than the latest \\"Eyewitless News\\": bulletin on television.  It remind us of how Paine faced the world's mightiest power and wrote of hope with confidence in the future;  it is a glowing contrast to today's climate of fear, doubt and suspicion which shows the absence of a modern Tom Paine.nary France.

Instead, Chaco was the site of shrines, just as the Vatican is the site of shrines and not a vast housing complex. People went to Chaco, observed their rites, smashed the pottery jars they brought and went home.  Collapse came with the arrival of the kachina religion, and new technologies which helped the puebloans move to river sites where they live to this day.<br /><br /> Californians have long thought of themselves as 25 years ahead of mankind;  it's a flattering self-image, but one of folly that is the basis for this book.  First, California is too small to be a pattern for the future of mankind;  second, Californians are too unimaginative to be anything but a miner's canary for more sensible peoples; third, any economic or social ripples from the collapse of California won't spread much further than Arizona.<br /><br /> He cites Chaco is an example, and Easter Island.  He looks for the faults, ignoring the fact there is always a logical rationale when people do wrong.  What did the person who cut down the last tree in Easter Island think?  They likely thought, with all due respect to current US policies, they were saving their society.  Californians, and Diamond, may think they are saving modern America with his analysis.<br /><br /> It's a noble idea, but it's wrong because it ignores the human capacity to adapt.  Europe did not thrive after the last ice age due to any innate superiority of its inhabitants;  success was due to a wide range of unique circumstances.  The trend today is to seek one \\"magic bullet\\" to explain complex situations;  ecology is merely the latest of a long line of disasters from which mankiond has escaped by the skin of its teeth.  Success, as always then, now and in the future, is the combination of millions of individual decisions by people who believe they can succeed by their own merits  --  and not by luck.<br /><br /> Many ancient societies collapsed because they were too small;  a disaster, of nature or man-made, overwhelmed a group which had no in depth resources to sustain them.  When Santorini erupted in 1600 BC, it destroyed a variety of \\"great\\" nations that were, in reality, less than the population of many modern suburbs.  The recent Asian tsunami shows the impact of a major disaster on relatively small communities;  but the overall impact on the stricken nations shows none will collapse.  The destruction of Banda Aceh is a tragedy for Banda Aceh, and a hardship for Indonesia, but merely a ripple for Australia and the rest of the world.<br /><br /> California does not represent the future of the world, nor does this book.  In the US, a genuine religious revival similar to that of the Chacoans 900 years ago or even England 200 years ago would completely change the future.  History is not a \\"great man\\" thesis, nor a \\"great idea\\" thesis that was in vogue for much of the last century;  history is the long term wisdom of crowds.<br /><br /> If you believe in California, a culture of excess success and extravagent failure, this is an interesting and even prophetic book.  But if you believe in the incredible complexity of human response to disaster, this book will leave you wanting someone who looks at the wisdom of crowds instead of the folly of individuals.y is merely the latest of a long line of disasters from which mankiond has escaped by the skin of its teeth.

Being Catholics enabled his family to emigrate to Canada, where he became the leading political analyst in newspapers, magazines and books.  Like many immigrants, he is more Canadian than most people born in the country;  the result is a book written with humour, kindness and a sense of shattering disappointment and disillusion.<br /><br />  Political journalism is a slash-and-burn war in the US, anchored by the pure hatred of right-wing zealots such as Rush Limbaugh and his ilk;  or the pompous twits who debate whether dissent to erudite liberal wisdom ranks above or below the grunts of orangutans.  In Canada, journalism proves \\"the emperor has no clothes\\" by laughing at the foibles, faults, fears and follies of politicians.  Newman is a 'Mack the Knife' artist, he doesn't use the blunt force trauma of a California Terminator.  Newman wielded the best scalpel in Canadian journalism for decades, and he did so with such skill that his victims never felt obliged to drop him from their Christmas card list.  In this book, he provides the delicious details of how it was done,.<br /><br />  But it's much more.<br /><br />  Think of Newman as an intelligent Garrison Keillor, who talks for 20-minutes every week about the inanities of ordinary folks in Lake Woebegone.  Newman tells even better stories about the motivations of the rich and powerful leaders of America's largest trading partner (the single largest source of foreign oil, for example).  Newman's harshest criticism is of his own shortcomings, not the faults of the unworthy villains writhing on the point of his pen.  But he also portrays the absolute perfidy of some Canadian politicians, the devils who make any US president look saintly by comparison.  It's the approach many wish they could have used against newman 40 years ago.<br /><br />  A few years ago, Newman visited the Theresienstadt concentration camp where most of his relatives died.  He also saw10 names the same as his  --  Peta Neumann  --  ranging in age from 10 months to 10 years.  This is what he escaped in a series of events that would put the film world to shame.  But this is not another Holocaust book;  it is a story of a life that soared to greatness when nourished by the freedom of Canada.  Instead of the \\"scorched earth\\" journalism of the US which I favoured, he used humour to puncture the hubris of the high and haughty.  In the US, humour is often acerbic.  Newman embodies the definition by Stephen Leacock, \\"the essence of humour is human kindliness\\", but he accompanies it all with his penetrating analysis of Canadian politics.<br /><br />  To understand the soul of Canada today, this is the prime guidebook.<br /><br />  It's written by a man who knows how to love;  a combination of pure exhilaration and crushing despair that creates true passion.  Instead of the polls and poltroons of modern politics, Newman's focus is on the feelings and meanings of public service.  I've known him since the 1970s, and we've been in the like sport for decades,  though I've never worked with or for him (he does quote me briefly in the book).  Based on my career, I can honestly say this is the book of a master craftsman gifted with a rare insight, sensitivity and acumen.<br /><br />  It's liable to infuriate many Canadians, who tend to be very sensitive about having their political idols described as emperors without clothes.  For that reason, it's probably the best book about Canada written within the last 50 years.  Newman reflects the finest principle of honest journalism, \\"Comfort the afflicted, afflict the comfortable\\".out Canada written within the last 50 years.

Having spent almost 40 years in the news business as a reporter, photographer and editor, I have some experience in recognizing good pictures and hiring people who can produce good pictures.  By any standard, these are great pictures.<br /><br /> A \\"great picture\\" hinges on an intangible called the moment of peak action.  Let me explain that by referring to a photo not in this book;  the angry defiant look of Sir Winston Churchill in the portrait by Yousouf Karsh of Ottawa, Canada.  Churchill was angry because Karsh had just taken away his cigar, which Churchill had just lit of relax after a speech to the Canadian parliament.  It's probably the most famous portrait ever of Churchill.<br /><br /> Had I taken that picture, instead of the angry portrait I'd have waited and asked Churchill to \\"smile\\".  As everyone knows, it would have been a lousy picture of a great man.  Karsh had the genius to recognize the precise moment of peak action;  likewise, in picture after picture in this book, I saw the same superb talent in capturing the most evocative expression of the subjects.  This is the heart of great photography;  I think I can recognize it, just as an art critic can recognize a great painting without being able to do it.<br /><br /> Photography is the most accessible of the arts;  every parent wants \\"great\\" pictures of their children, every lover wants \\"great\\" pictures of their beloved, every tourist wants that memorable vacation memory.  This book is a superb course in what great pictures look like;  it's not just a museum of the finest, it's also a teaching example of \\"here's what a good picture is like\\" for anyone who takes pictures.  This quality can inspire your quality.<br /><br /> If we are to learn, we might as well learn from the best whenever possible;  if we are to enjoy great art, we might as well have the best.  This book is an example of both;  the price is incredible for such a treasure trove.  It's awesome.<br /><br /> Buy it;  it'll improve your pictures, and your life.enjoy great art, we might as well have the best.

Think of rodeo queen version of 'Friday Night Lights' and similar football films over the years.  Becoming a rodeo queen is about beauty and and those who are merely pretty, which in a world of images and make believe of the modern West rates far higher than just a bikini and a smile.<br /><br /> \\"Borrrrrring\\" is the first term that comes to mind to describe the West, in fiction and reality.  It's \\"boring\\" in terms of the daily drudgery; for many girls, being a rodeo queen will be the only real excitement in their dull lives.  Football has a few stars, as do cheer and pom and basketball and homecoming queen and even the chess team.  For most westerners, devoid of any of the culture or intellect of eastern states, even little excitements are welcome.<br /><br /> Burbick nicely describes this intensity and commitment;  rodeo queens are the daughters of successful entrepreneurs who can afford the considerable expense.  They know success came from working 16-hour and longer days when necessary;  the girls do the same to become a queen;  just as Burbick consulted more than 150 sources, plus dozens of interviews of rodeo queens from as far back as the 1930s to write her short but astute book.<br /><br /> Burbick is a \\"queen\\" in terms of her commitment to this topic and the quality of her book.  Although she's superb in linking the rodeo sport to conservative attitudes in the west, her weakness is not linking it to the intense competitive spirit that produces excellence in academics, in sports, or on the dark side in the form of juvenile crimes and mindless rebellion  --  all of which characterizes the West.<br /><br /> She deftly outlines the Western myth of rugged individualism and self-sufficiency;  but fails to understand that such myths create the limited acumen expressed in Western social and political attitudes  --  even if they are more fiction than practical.  Anyone who reads this book will understand why the West is solid Republican in politics, as well as the \\"Texas\\" attitude now in the White House.<br /><br /> Granted, rodeo queens won't regard this book as the best thing since chili and beans, or cold beer in longneck bottles.  But, anyone interested in the relentless competition of life which shaped the daddies of these precocious queens (the academic experience is very similar and is based on just as rich a background of myths and dreams),  it's a superb look at one of the crown jewels of the western experience.dividualism and self-sufficiency;  but fails to understand that such myths create the limited acumen expressed in Western social and political attitudes  --  even if they are more fiction than practical.

Here we have a great book by a great man on a great issue which really leaves any great answer to the perception and intelligence of the reader, great or otherwise.<br /><br /> In other words, devoid of answers from the three great men who contributed to the book  --  it could become a great movie, if anyone in Hollywood is great enough to understand it.  Otherwise, it's a great read at any level from the banality of Jurassic Park to the profound meanings of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.  Speaking of Jurassic Park, the inherent logic of this book reflects one reviewer's comment that the movie was so good it was impossible to tell the fake dinosaurs from the real ones.<br /><br /> The premise of the book is interesting, \\"If you knew, knew with complete conviction, that nothing you did could possibly be observed by anyone else, would it seem worthwhile to do anything?\\"  In this case, which refutes the original premise, the answer is to leave a message for someone else to find.<br /><br /> It's Robinson Crusoe without the woodsy ingenuity, with dinosaurs instead of pirates.  Simpson was widely regarded as the greatest vertebrate paleontologist of the last century;  but in this book he seems to realize his dinosaur knowledge was limited to fossil bones and not even as much as the smell of a dinosaur, let alone the flowers of the plants on which they survived.<br /><br /> One interesting issue he raises concerns crocodiles,  unchanged for 100 million years.  Simpson says, \\"Here was no failure but an adaptation so successful, so perfect that once developed it never needed to change.\\"  Stephen Jay Gould in an afterword, says Simpson \\"offers the ultimate Darwinian explanation for human success  --  not an inherent trend of our innate superiority (as the old anti-Darwinian theorists might have argued), but the good fortune of our ancestors' lives in a challenging and changing environment that required continual evolutionary activity.\\"<br /><br /> Okay, what about accidental genetic change that produces a wide range of options of which only a few, or none, can survive in a changing environment?  The \\"challenging and changting environment\\" is lip service to the spirit of free enterprise and competition with which we describe our social environment.  But what if that's wrong?<br /><br /> Sam Magruder was catapulted 80 million years back in time, and remained very much Sam Magruder  --  it's as if Simpson has set out to sly shatter Gould's (and thousands of other scientists) \\"ultimate Darwinian explanation for human success.\\"<br /><br /> It's what makes this a fascinating quick read which prompts any number of open-ended questions.

If you're fed up with the status quo, and want to join an intelligent refomer who uses scalpel to expose the rotten flesh of the existing system, this book will confirm your every worst fear about politics.<br /><br /> In 1968, I watched presidential candidates descend on our little community and was totally baffled at the insipid, trivial and biased coverage of the so-called national press.  It's now much worse, and Dean has the guts to \\"expose the rotten flesh\\" of the media.  His criticism of the Democrats pulls no punches, and is devastating on the Greedy Old Party.<br /><br /> Dean knows anout miracle cures, which is what voters expect every four years;  BUT, like every good doctor, he knows it is far more important to change one's lifestyle than to pop yet another pill or spend another session under the scalpel.  He doesn't do \\"feel good\\" politics, he prescribes changes in lifestyle.<br /><br /> Think of applying the doctor's motto to politics, \\"First, do no harm.\\"<br /><br /> If you understand that, you'll understand his approach.  If you go to a doctor to have your appendix removed, you'll end up with no appendix and a fading little scar on your tummy.  Politicians, as anyone who watched the debates or saw any political ads knows, recommend a shotgun to remove your appendix  --  and the entire substance of their debate centers on the use of a 410-gauge or a 12-gauge gun with SSGs or birdshot.<br /><br /> Most politicians want to go back to the past;  Barry Goldwater liked 1910, George Wallace liked 1930, Richard Nixon liked 1950 and, both John Kerry and George Bush act as if they'd love to go back to the Clinton prosperity of 2000.  Dean is one who realizes that all of us are going to live in the future, and it's up to each of us as to how we live.<br /><br /> Despite the nattering nabobs of negativism, to use the words of the man who helped invent much of today's negative politics, Dean has unbounded optimism in America.  He's not here to pronounce a death sentence, which many politicians offer if they are not elected;  he's here to show all Americans how to live a better life.<br /><br /> If you're tired of the way lawyers have run the country, there's a lot to be said for doctors.  This doctor says a lot in a brief space.  He knows, \\"Politicians can't solve our problems for us.\\"  Dean says America's faults are based on the attitude \\"we're always looking for someone to come along and save us.\\"<br /><br /> The good doctor knows we have to save ourselves.  This book is a prescription to get started.  It's well worth reading.  From there on, if you love this country, it's up to you and people like you.

In twenty-five words or less, this book says President George Bush's \\"liberation\\" of Iraq is remarkably similar to President McKinley's \\"liberation\\" of the Philippines more than a century ago.<br /><br /> So, what do Filipinos think of Bush?  According to the Sept. 6, 2004, edition of The Financial Times of London, Filipinos gave Bush the biggest margin in any of the 35 countries surveyed by GlobeScan, in conjunction with the University of Maryland.  The poll says 57 percent of Filipinos support Bush, compared to 32 percent for Sen. John Kerry.  This isn't recent bubble of popularity;  in 2002, a survey by a Manila-based polling group, Pulse Asia, found that Bush enjoyed a 56 percent trust rating  --  much higher than the president of the Philippines.<br /><br /> Judis, one of the most perceptive and knowledgable writers in America, uses all the history that fits to argue that \\"through international organizations and treaties, the United States would keep the peace and promote prosperity much more effectively than it could accomplish acting alone.\\"  He doesn't ask what will happen if others use his recommended techniques against America.<br /><br /> He cites the experience of presidents from Theodore Roosevelt to George W. Bush to argue \\"Until the 1890s, the United States had adhered to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson's advice to stay out of 'foreign entanglements'.\\"  Of course, this ignores US invasions of Canada in 1775/76, 1812/14, and major threats in 1846 and 1865/67 which produced the Confederation of Canada, up to this century and the victimization of Canada by seizing lands in the Alaska Boundary dispute.  It also overlooks the Monroe Doctrine, which in effect made the Caribbean \\"an American lake\\" and all of the Americas into a US colony.<br /><br /> \\"Bush was ignorant\\" Judis argues, saying his \\"religious beliefs seem to have grown out of a sense of personal redemption from sin  --  in his case, alcoholism . . . . \\"  After Sept. 11, 2001, he says US foreign policy was shaped by neoconservatives such as Irving Kristol and Wohlstetter who were both Trotskyists (i.e. communists) and former socialists who had undergone a sudden and complete transformation of faith similar to what Bush experienced.<br /><br /> True!  True!  True!  He cites facts again and again and again.  Only the uncurious and ignorant can dispute his facts.  His conclusion addresses everyone who cares very deeply about the future, \\"When America goes out alone in search of monsters to destroy  --  venturing on terrain upon which imperial powers have already trod  --  it can itself become the monster.\\"<br /><br /> This isn't a political book that will die with the election results, no matter who wins.  The lessons Judis cites will live with us for decades, regardless of who is elected and whatever decisions are made.  Maybe, in a century, 57 percent of Iraqis will think Bush was right.  The real issue is the blood, treasure, toil, suffering and misery to get to that happy conclusion.<br /><br /> Judis says there are much better techniques than shooting first and letting Allah sort out the good guys.  This book is for the years ahead.  The election of 2004 is a mere speed bump on the road of history.  The future may be a smooth highway, or a rutted mass of potholes and quagmires, depending on what voters decide.says US foreign policy was shaped by neoconservatives such as Irving Kristol and Wohlstetter who were both Trotskyists (i.e. communists) and former socialists who had undergone a sudden and complete transformation of faith similar to what Bush experienced. <br /> <br /> True!

But, this molehill of courage doesn't write a word in this book about President Geoge Bush.<br /><br /> He says it's courageous and vital to dissent.  Nice.  Welcome to an idea that has been celebrated since John Milton and the First Amendmant to the US Constitution.  To guard his own brilliance, he doesn't cite a single example of the how, when, where, why and what of anyone he's criticized.  His book is supposed to be \\"the art of mentoring,\\" but he limits it to praise of his own courage, insight, wit and relevance.<br /><br /> Granted, Hitchens is a rare talent;  his unique ability is being outrageous without being effective.  He doesn't cite a single example of his dissonance doing diddly squat.  He offers feel-good whines, moans and complaints, but nothing constructive.  It's why late-night TV talk show monologues are the epitome of today's political commentary, humour, satire and relevance.<br /><br /> He consistently attacks political compromise, praising \\"fanatics and absolutists like John Brown, who regarded compromise as a disgrace.\\"  So  --  was Abraham Lincoln a second-rate president compared to a John Brown?  This reflects the great weakness of this book:  Hitchens doesn't understand the difference between dissent and dissonance.<br /><br /> There's a good reason why Hitchens is inconsequential compared to dissent such as Zola, Vaclav Havel and even Tom Lehrer  --  this rant is always safe, tame and respectable.  It's a perfect Hallowe'en gift, a fierce rubbery face meant to produce a shriek, a laugh and a comment, \\"Oh, how clever!\\"  It's great sport for the two-year-old mentality.<br /><br /> \\"Most people, most of the time, prefer to seek approval or security,\\" Hitchens writes.  This is his meagre attempt at respectability;  he does so by citing great dissenters and basking in their reflected courage, glory and relevance.  He falls far short of being a court jester, lacking the wit, wisdom, wiles and wariness to be relevant.<br /><br />Sadly, but not unexpectedly, he misses the mark.erfect Hallowe'en gift, a fierce rubbery face meant to produce a shriek, a laugh and a comment, \\"Oh, how clever!\\"  It's great sport for the two-year-old mentality.<br /><br /> \\"Most people, most of the time, prefer to seek approval or security,\\" Hitchens writes.

Maybe, as Saint Exupery implies, adults are too sophisticated, too wise, too adult, to understand the eloquent common sense about living a rational life.  It takes some thought, insight and reason to comprehend the innate meaning.  It's the ultimate 'take time to stop and smell the roses\\" book, which brings to mind an anecdote from 'Art and Fear' by David Batles and Ted Orland, quoting Howard Ikemoto:<br /><br /> \\"When my daughter was about seven years old, she asked me one day what I did at work.  I told her I worked at the college  --  that my job was to teach people how to draw.<br /><br /> \\"She stared back at me, incredulous, and said, 'You mean they forget?'\\"<br /><br /> The Little Prince is just as incredulous about many attitudes he encounters on Earth;  on his travels, he keeps meeting adults who are wrapped up in their self-importance and egos.  Surely, Saint Exupery understood the difference;  his dedication was to \\"Leon Werth\\" in 1943 France, which he \\"corrected\\" to read, \\"To Leon Werth when he was a little boy.\\"<br /><br /> It's a book of wonderful important things which children understand  (it made me appreciate once again the importance of rotten crab apples)  but which we set aside as adults.  Children will understand it instinctively in their hearts  . . . . .  think of reading a few pages every night as a child falls asleep.  Adults will love the allegories, and it will truly bring back memories of their own rag doll, or blankie (to use a term from Peanuts), or worn baseball glove, or even their own squishy soft rotten apples.<br /><br /> As adults, we are all familiar with advertising;  but, how manjy of us realize that advertising is lies  --  not in an absolute literal sense  --  but because it emphasizes terrible destructive myths and untruths to us (Do things really go better with Coke?)<br /><br /> Written in 1943, when Adolf Hitler dominated much of Europe, the Little Prince meets an \\"absolute monarch\\" who tells him, \\"Accepted authority rests first of all on reason.  If you ordered your people to go throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution.\\"  In other words, absolute authority depends on being reasonable;  unreasonable orders reflect a failure of the person giving the order, not a fault of anyone unable to carry out such an order.<br /><br /> \\"When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a litte from the truth,\\" Saint Exupery writes.  Balance that with an observation by Pablo Picasso, \\"Computers are useless  --  all they can give you are answers.\\"<br /><br /> In a world jammed with billions of facts and little or no understanding, this book is a reminder that a full and complete life is more than \\"the bottom line\\" of anything.  Had I read it as a little boy, I don't think I'd have understood its wisdom;  had I read it as an young adult, I don't think I'd have understood its wisdom;  having at last read it, I hope I'm not to late to understand its wisdom.ts an \\"absolute monarch\\" who tells him, \\"Accepted authority rests first of all on reason.

As Quindlen states, \\"Perhaps in a small way he wanted to drive home what is always a valuable lesson, when we insist on learning the world through books:  that accuracy and truth are sometimes quite different things.\\"  True enough, I suppose.  But, on a personal basis and having once visited London myself, her book brings back an \\"accuracy and truth\\" that was much better than my memories of London.<br /><br /> Anyone reading this is obviously a literate person;  on that basis, Quindlen offers a fine tour of the literary highlights of one of the world's great cities.  Why is London great?  She says, \\"A third of London . . . is grass or gardens.\\"  She appreciates the people, places, writers and words of London and how they came to hold such a powerful place in literature.<br /><br /> In a world where Quarter Pounders with Cheese and Gap jeans are as ubiquitous as Burberrys and Harris Tweeds, London is distinctive.  New York, like Phoenix and many American cities, was planned with a mathematical rigour that is as user-friendly as a straight jacket.  If New York streets are a Mondrian painting, and Phoenix a Rorschach cookie-cutter test, then London is the genius of a Picasso.  London just grew, and nothing from the collapse of Londinium to the Great Fire of 1666 to the Blitz of World War II has persuaded Londoners to destroy its human appeal.<br /><br /> A city this good deserves an author with the sensitivity and insight and perception of Quindlen;  every reader of this book will be delighted she turned her loquacious talents to lovely London and its wonderful charms, its quirks and oddities and normalities and routines which create a city worth remembering.  Quindlen is truly an author worth reading.remembering.  Quindlen is truly an author worth reading. <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-09-26

It helped propel western society to world dominance, even though it was invented and widely used outside Europe;  yet, Europeans made it truly destructive and an element of domination.  Kelly quotes a sixteenth-century diplomat who summed up the conquering mind-set, \\"Religion supplies the pretext and gold the motive.\\"<br /><br /> In that vein, he also sums as the character of Samuel Colt \\"as typically American:  abrasive, self-made, persistent, eminently practical in his thinking, as imaginative as he was mercenary, an opportunist, a liar, a genius.\\"  If these qualities, plus the lust for gold, turned Europeans into world conquerors using gunpowder, square-rigged ships and a variety of other innovations, then we need hardly be surprised if similar horrors are used against us.<br /><br /> In other words, gunpowder was the means but not the motive for changing the world.  Kelly also suggests \\"an irrational antagonism toward non-Christians, Moslems in particular.\\"  In other words, gunpowder was perfected by secular scientists and used by greedy opportunists under the cover of religious fundamentalism to dominate the world.<br /><br /> Kelly raises these questions;  but, quite rightly, leaves them unanswered.  This is a book about gunpowder, not national psyches or ambitions.  Kelly outlines the innovative and highly effective uses of gunpowder through the ages;  given his history of the stuff, it leaves every intelligent reader open to ponder the questions of the multiple roles in which it was used.<br /><br /> Quite frankly, a similar book could be written about the development of square rigged ships \\"that changed the world.\\"  But then, how many books on dominant weapons systems are needed to repeat the obvious?  He offers a wealth of background and opinions on the early use of gunpowder, then the reader to discern the motives, noble or otherwise.<br /><br /> His examination falls short of formulae and chemical reaction diagrams, which would have been nice but perhaps superfluous and possibly dangerous;  a careful reader can probably piece together a working formula, but probably not a dangerous one.  It isn't the sort of book that young boys will use to blow up the outhouse;  but, it does present a fascinating glimpse of just what our ancestors had to put up with to make today's world.<br /><br /> Until I read this book, I thought I knew a little about gunpowder  --  having made my own \\"fizz powder\\" and used black powder pistols.  For me, Kerry opened up a vast new vista that turned my early efforts into a farce and left my previous knowledge in a thimble.  In comparison to my teaspoonful of knowledge, he gave me a bucket of factinating insights.<br /><br /> You don't have to love gunpowder, loud noises, bombs bursting in air or movies such as \\"Master and Commander,\\" to love this book.  Kelly makes story of gunpowder relevant for all and leaves you all the more interested in how our modern world came to be.ps \\"that changed the world.\\"  But then, how many books on dominant weapons systems are needed to repeat the obvious?

However, the decline and fall of Canada is not necessarily the pattern for the decline and fall of civilisation  --  regardless of the level of civilisation in Canada.  Canada has had a de facto one-party rule since the 1930s, and like Cuba, North Korea and Haiti, the domination by one political party or one economic class does not produce continuing prosperity.<br /><br /> Jacobs states \\"a large part of the country is economically stagnant or declining\\" in describing Canada, then lapses into the Oswald Spengler syndrome.  Spengler, the German historian whose faith in his homeland was shattered by its World War I defeat, based his book \\"The Decline of the West\\" on that collapse.  Since Canada has no military to speak of, she blames a cabal of unnamed neoconservatives, similar to the right-wing pseudo-intellectuals in the White House who are blamed for every stupid mistake made by George Bush (as if he wasn't dumb enough to make his own mistakes every now and then).<br /><br /> Her book is greatly weakened by her inability, and she hints the inability of anyone in Canada, to know how the heavy taxes collected by the federal government are spent.  She is definitely right that Canada is declining;  for example, Statistics Canada reports a crime rate of 9,907 offenses per 100,000 people in 1990;  this compares to a crime rate of 5,900 in the US.  She writes of Toronto, Canada's richest city, where she lives, as having \\"a disquieting surliness or public sullenness;  impatience, impoliteness, rage.  These are more subtle signs that Toronto has become a city in crisis, indeed in multiple crises.\\"  It's a sorry decline since I lived there in the 1960s.<br /><br /> If Canada is the miner's canary of the civilized world, then we're all in deep trouble.  But what of Britain?  When British Rail grew tired of constant breakdowns of its aging diesel locomotives, they bought new ones made in London, Ontario (in a US branch plant).  On any given day, one quarter of British-built locomotives are out of service;  compared to only 5 percent of the Canadian locomotives.  Somebody in Canada must be doing something right.<br /><br /> Jacobs seems intent on finding bad examples, and there are plenty in any society.  She's one of the most astute observers of the human condition, so this may not be merely senior citizen grumpiness.  In this case, to misquote a famed Dorothy Parker review, \\"This book should not be set aside lightly, it should be considered with great force.\\"<br /><br /> Personally, I think she's dead wrong.  I considered her basic premise wrong before I began reading the book;  nothing I read changed my limited acumen, and I'll re-read the book because I think it's that good.  Whether you agree with her or not, Jacobs is well worth reading.  But I really, sincerely, fervently, passionately, hope she's wrong.Toronto has become a city in crisis, indeed in multiple crises.\\"  It's a sorry decline since I lived there in the 1960s. <br />  <br /> If Canada is the miner's canary of the civilized world, then we're all in deep trouble.

It's an idea expressed in Genesis XII;  Abraham understands what God has told him, Feiler treats God's gift of individualism to Abraham as a Club Med travelogue.<br /><br /> For tribal people, before the time of Abraham and still valid for those who need the comfort of group-think, identity is defined by the clan, tribe, cult or ideology.  Abraham is the first to endorse the idea of individual identity, not in terms of personal hedonism and irresponsibility but as responsible to God for the basis of a moral life.  It's an idea that has yet to be widely adopted;  \\"born again\\" fundamentalists of many faiths believe they can do whatever they like because they \\"accept\\" God or Jesus or Allah who forgives them all their sins.  It reflects the modern attitude, \\"Jesus paid for our sins, so let's get our money's worth.\\"<br /><br /> This contrast between mass identity and personal individualism has been often explored;  a classic example is \\"Escape from Freedom\\" in which Eric Fromm says people who cannot live with freedom will invariably turn to fundamentalism of some kind.  The fault with the three great religions Feiler portrays as having grown from Abraham is not their common origin, but the fundamental fanaticism of modern followers who willingly submit to totalitarian faiths.<br /><br /> Feiler ignores the contrast between tribal or group comforts, and the individualism of Abraham which gave birth to societies where individuals feel isolated, dehumanized and alienated.  The result is often blind devotion to a cult, abject submission to a Leader and barbarous policies of suicidal mass murder.  The individualism of Abraham is like the Ten Commandments of Moses  --  great ideas from the very Highest and Best of Authority  --  but how many people are willing to accept the full reality of such wisdom?<br /><br /> Instead, Feiler limits himself to a Sunday School recitation of nice but conventional ideas about Abraham.  He ignores the basic lesson God applied to Abraham, \\"Okay, Bro, you're on your own  . . . .  take responsibility for your own actions and you'll be okay.\\"  Instead, this book is written in the image of Big Daddy looking after all of us, if only Big Daddy can figure out why we're fighting among ourselves.<br /><br /> It's a great read, but that's almost a foregone conclusion when you consider the basic source of the original material.  It could have been much better.  Today's deadliest conflicts are not the product of Abraham or God, they occur because we expect God to look after us instead of accepting what Abraham learned  --  accept responsibility for yourself.<br /><br /> Buy it, then read it as a springboard to enable your mind to leap into the future.  It doesn't offer answers from the past;  but, as individuals, there's nothing like a nice review of the status quo to serve as an incentive to leap into the future.humanized and alienated.

Kennedy.<br /><br /> It was Kennedy, after all, who acquiesced in the pre-emptive war against Cuba also known as the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  Kennedy gave the world the Cuban Missile crisis, when the whole world trembled in genuine fear of a nuclear war, simply because the Soviets wanted to give Cuba the weapons it needed to deter future US-sponsored invasions.  Also, when it comes to pre-emptive war, Kennedy greatly escalated the US role in Vietnam to protect a minority Roman Catholic government imposed upon a Buddist/Taoist people.<br /><br /> Get the idea?  My president good, your president bad, says Schlesinger.  It's fine for a partisan pre-election pamphlet, but it's hardly serious history.  He writes that Condoleeza Rice, \\"the former provost of Stanford, does not know her American history.\\"  True enough;  maybe, like himself, it's a fault of those who plunge into partisan politics.<br /><br /> Granted, he does stumble across an interesting fact every now and then.  For example, he asserts \\". . . . the Afghan war was necessary, since the Taliban refused to turn over bin Laden.\\"  Okay.  Bin Laden, who may well be hiding in Pakistan, hasn't been found by the US either.  There was a regime change because the Taliban couldn't find bin Laden;  perhaps there should be a regime change in the US for the same reason.<br /><br /> Maybe finding bin Laden is similar to finding \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" in Iraq.  If the US can't find bin Laden or WMD, maybe it wasn't the fault of the regimes they changed in both countries.  On that basis, Mexico hasn't found bin Laden or WMD either.  Maybe Bush plans to invade Mexico for the same reasons;  if not that, perhaps a preemptive war to prevent Mexico from taking back California and the Southwest.<br /><br /> The real issue is how to curb the ability of a president, whether Kennedy, Bush or even President Hillary after 2008, from launching wars as a personal whim.  President Eisenhower was able to refuse many warm invitations to a hot war;  but, since 1960, American presidents have literally roamed the world to look for a war, any war, every war in which the foe looked small and weak.  President Clinton is the only one who couldn't find a war to fight  --  except with the radical right who were glad to duke it out toe-to-toe with him.  No wonder he had such a failed presidency;  all peace, prosperity, hanky panky and no war.<br /><br /> It's hardly a book for Bush bashers.  But, it will appeal to all pseudo intellectuals who want to sound erudite when they are deep in the chablis, croissants and criticism.  Buy it.  Anyone, everyone, will love it.  It's a romp through history on a unicycle;  just don't stop to think too much, or you'll fall down and thump your head on the hard rock of reality.The real issue is how to curb the ability of a president, whether Kennedy, Bush or even President Hillary after 2008, from launching wars as a personal whim.

A Republican cook book?<br /><br /> Only in America. I've been to lots of bean bakes, goat ropings, tribal fairs, wooly sheep ridings and Republican teas -- and until now I thought Republicans lived by caterers alone. I'm shocked. Can America be a global hyperpower if Republicans learn to boil water without burning it, to cook macaroni and even make meat loaf?<br /><br /> Meat loaf? Would you believe a 'Bacon Cheeseburger Meat Loaf'? Granted, it's probably a little more tasty and nutritious than the meat loaf the Republican Sheriff Joke feeds prison inmates in Maricopa County. But then, these are seriously delicious recipes. By the same token, there isn't a recipe for any Democratic beans, hot dogs or baking powder (cowboy) biscuits. In other words, this is an Original Meaning all Natural Law and Back-to-Basics Republican cookbook. It'll do your Constitution good.<br /><br /> After years of cooking the books, it's nice to know Republicans can now cook an &quot;Irene Halligan's Mighty Mac and Cheese&quot; dish. As for secrets, this book also explains the mystery of those WMDs no one could find in Iraq; the initials really mean 'Whiskey of Much Delight' and refers to Jack Daniels. For the Born Again crowd, there's a 'Jack Daniel Died for Your Sins Whiskey . . . recipe.' It calls for &quot;2 tablespoons Jack Daniel's Black Label.&quot; Now, you just known any Democratic recipe would start with &quot;1 quart store brand vodka . . . &quot;<br /><br /> It's a fun book. You you want to know just how authentic it is? Let me tell you. Right up front, in the &quot;Acknowledgements,&quot; Townsend blames the Clinton administration.<br /><br /> I kid you not.<br /><br /> She writes, &quot;. . .a special and heartfelt thanks to the Clinton administration who taught me the most valuable lesson of all: in America, you can get away with anything, including a cookbook called 'How to Eat Like a Republican'.&quot; It's almost as if Dick Cheney wrote the introduction.<br /><br /> It's a fun book. Republicans can have a ton of laughs reading about &quot;Spotted Dick Nixon&quot; (suet and raisins), &quot;Pat Buchanan's Buffalo Right Wings&quot; and &quot;Rush's Mom's Fluffy Potato Casserole&quot; (it explains why he's as smart as a boiled potato). Care for some &quot;DAR Deviled Eggs&quot;? How about an &quot;Unimpeachable Peach Cobbler&quot; in case Slick Willy comes to visit? Or an &quot;Calvin Cooler&quot; (named for the president, not the comic strip). Thirsty? Try Dad's Margarita&quot; (4 ounces Jack Daniels Black Label, ice).<br /><br /> Maybe it's anominous omen for November, &quot;If you can't stand the heat in the Oval Office, get into the kitchen.&quot; If that happens, look for a Democratic sequel next year, &quot;How to Order Lunch at the Country Club without Sounding Like a Democrat.&quot;&quot;Spotted Dick Nixon&quot; (suet and raisins), &quot;Pat Buchanan's Buffalo Right Wings&quot; and &quot;Rush's Mom's Fluffy Potato Casserole&quot; (it explains why he's as smart as a boiled potato).

This is a noble effort by a tired old politician who is eloquently trying to revive the charitible policies of the past<br />in an era for which they are mostly irrelevant.<br />Granted, it's much better than the Republican policy of deliberately imposing hardship to force people to rise<br />above adversity. Cuomo advocates old bad policies, which is admittedly far better than the horrible policies of the<br />Republicans. It's sad; instead of innovation, he merely offers a rebuilt Lincoln when America needs a hybrid<br />Escape.<br />It's a common failing. Consider development of the Atlas missile; in World War II, the Germans developed the V-2<br />rocket and used it with devastating results. By 1946, the US wanted a bigger and better rocket. The Atlas<br />origram encountered years of opposition and delays because the bureaucracy consisted of former pilots who<br />favored manne aircraft; the Atlas missile, conceived in 1946, didn't become operational until 1961.<br />It is a classic example of the status quo being unable to understand the future. In this case, Cuomo can't see<br />beyond the brilliance of President Franklin Roosevelt who exemplified the best of Lincoln's concern for the<br />common citizen. The problem is that we don't live in the time of Lincoln, or Roosevelt.<br />President John F. Kennedy saw beyond Roosevelt; in his inaugural, he stated, &quot;Ask not what your country can do<br />for you -- ask what you can do for your country.&quot; It was a dramatic contrast to the &quot;complacency is enough&quot; of<br />President Eisenhower and the &quot;greed is enough&quot; of recent Republicans. Now, Cuomo says, &quot;A decent respect for<br />our citizens requires us to use our resources in ways that would benefit those of our people who, although<br />deserving, have not enjoyed as much progress as those more fortunate.&quot; He says that gives 98 percent of<br />Americans the right to dip into the public treasury.<br />If you believe such policies, this is a wonderful and uplifting book. By all means, buy it. Cuomo is skilled and<br />perceptive writer; his words will warm all &quot;the government owes me a living&quot; types from food stamps to corporate<br />welfare.<br />But if you believe, as I do, that our society is rich with incredible opportunities for anyone and everyone, then<br />you'll find this book misses the future. It's as though, in 1946 and wanting a bigger and better and faster version<br />of the V-2, the military had embarked on a program to breed bigger and better and faster horses.<br />America's future is awaiting a new Kennedy, one with the foresight to state, &quot;Ask not what your country can do<br />for you . . . ask what you can do for yourself.&quot;<br />In a society as rich, open and varied as America, success does not depend on the stars, or on what one can<br />obtain from the government.

Originally published in 1969, this somewhat typographically sloppy edition looks to have been hastily re-issued to cash in on the publicity for the much derided 2004 film version of King Arthur.<br /> &quot;The search for the man himself has become a continuing quest for what lies hidden in the hearts of all men,&quot; writes Hibbert, the perfect guide to legend and fact.  It's a concise book, less time to read than attending the film, but of far more value and meaning.<br /> His closing tribute is to T. H. White's masterful &quot;Once and Future King&quot;, in which King Arthur was &quot;not a distressed Briton hopping about in a suit of woad in the fifth century&quot; but a true knight with &quot;an open face, with kind eyes and a reliable or faithful expression, as though he was a good learner who enjoyed being alive . . . . .&quot;  Like White, he fully understands the significance of the legend.<br /> So, who was Arthur?  Well, legends are expressions of the ideals a society want to attain.  In today's world, President George Bush wants to be &quot;a war president.&quot; In contrast, King Arthur was a leader who defeated the ruthless terrorists of his time and sought to be known as a man who brought peace to the English people.  The Round Table was an expression of the equality of all who upheld, in the words of White, &quot;the idea that force ought to be used, if it is used at all, on behalf of justice, not on its own account.&quot;<br /> Hibbert leaves no doubt that a real Arthur once existed, but he is not so foolish as to proclaim any specific legend or locale as the true Camelot or any specific man as the original Arthur.  He carefully illustrates how church and civil authorities have used the legend to bolster their own selfish causes.  It is a marvelous exercise in the study and application of history, illustrating the contrast between legend, fact and what we know to be true.  After reading this book, even the movie may make sense as more than a woad and weird action adventure.<br /> &quot;But the quest for Arthur of Britain never can destroy the beauty of the works that his legend has inspired or the fascination of the legend itself,&quot; Hibbert writes.  This book is a perfect introduction to those ideas and ideals.  You won't do better, even though you may later plunge into the wonderful depth and detail of other accounts of the Arthurian legend.<br />It is a great book.

US	49694975	R3PEMBHQCT92O2	042505974X	936918847	Against Fall Of Night	Books	3	4	10	N	N	Clarke's usual dim view of mankind	Once again, this is a fearful and brilliant vision of the triumph of a future of material values;  and, typical of Clarke, it is a story in which the last spark of human spirit rebels against conformity and ignites a new flame of freedom.<br /> It's a wonderful book for people who like this sort of book;  i.e., the premise is that humans are basically too dumb to accomplish much of anything without getting a kick-start from some vastly-superior all-knowing eternally-wise civilization.  It's a good story of one-dimensional characters encountering a faceless perfection;  for an analogy, think of a world in which everyone is a clone of the Stepford Wives without their wit, wisdom or waxy perfection.<br /> It does raise the question  --  What would life be like if it was perfect?  Clarke doesn't offer an answer, except for one young lad who wants to know more than the limits of perfect knowledge.  The first two-thirds of the book set out the usual dazzling Clarke scenario;  the final third degenerates into the &quot;life is more than you can understand&quot; formula.  His city of perfection is neatly packaged in one megalopis, perhaps somewhat like the Paolo Soleri vision of FutureWorld;  the element that upsets me is the assumption this vastly superior technology can't nurture a pot of geraniums outside its rigid borders.<br /> In my view, humans always test the limits of the possible and permissable.  Clarke assumes a human future where people don't color outside the lines;  in contrast, anyone who's been in prison  (I assume Clarke hasn't;  every month I work with a dozen or so people just out of prison)  knows the impossibility of living inside a closed door or blank wall.<br /> Clarke is a classy writer, he tells intriguing stories.  Personally, I don't like his sense of pessimism and deus ex machina escapism to explain the vicissitudes of mankind;  but, for those who think humans need a marvelous or malevant mechanical miracle to explain our faults, future or follies  . . . .  Clarke is very good.llies  . . . .  Clarke is very good.	2004-07-06

The French have lost this innate sense of survival, and this story is an eloquent description of a young man who was once disappointed and thus forever insouciant.<br /> The focus of this novel is a character who is a stark contrast to the typical Anglo attitude of resisting state, religious and most other authority;  instead, he presents a person devoid of values who simply goes limp even when facing the state authority of the guillotine.<br /> Such values nicely describe France and Camus.  The French collapse in 1940 is described by the Germans as one of their &quot;weekend wars.&quot;  In 1942, Camus spent a year in 'Le Panelier,' an old granite house in the village of Le Chambon, leisurely writing 'The Plague.' Like this book, it is an examination of man's willingness to allow killing without resisting it.<br /> It's the attitude of a totally defeated and demoralized people, an anthem of, by and for spineless wimps.  The Napoleonic era taught the French that hundreds of millions of Europeans rejected &quot;liberation&quot; when imposed by Franch cannons and bayonets.  Since then, France has only survived as an independent state because of the hated &quot;les anglais&quot; who came to their rescue in  1914 and 1944.<br /> Utterly devoid of any effort to control his own fate, Camus adroitly portrays a character who  --  like France itself  --  is a doormat for anyone and everyone.  It's a shocking book by American standards, but it inadvertently sums up the current French attitude that it's pointless to even attempt anything that resembles affirmative effort.<br /> Read it.  Think of it as a contrast between the domineering aggressive attitudes of Americans and the surrender monkeys of France.  It's an interesting insight into the mind and spirit of one of America's traditional allies; is timely, relevant and cogent.s of Americans and the surrender monkeys of France.

Books	4	5	9	N	N	How the Ice Age was discovered	Global warming is real, and this book succinctly explains how, when and why it has been happening during the past 10,000 years and the likely outcome if and when weather ever returns to normal.<br /> But, to take a longterm view, there's been a cooling trend since the end of the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago.  Civilization, as we know it, began with global warming which started about 10,000 years ago.  The emergence of modern humans began with a warm spell about 100,000 years ago.  The big delay is due to an intervening Ice Age.<br /> Though folks in Alberta, Alaska and Teec Nos Pos may not appreciate it for half of the year, we're now in the midst of a warm spell.  If weather was normal, Minnesota might well be a &quot;state of one massive ice sheet&quot; instead of &quot;the land of 10,000 lakes and 10 billion mosquitoes.&quot;  Without global warming, the 'Day After Tomorrow' film would be real.<br /> For better or worse, it doesn't address the current concern about human caused global warming.  The emphasis is on how we came to know what we now know, a basic primer on weather plus some added background on past ice ages.  The result is an excellent account of the procedures and values science as an intellectual process to discover how and why things work rather than providing a definitive and absolute answer to the unknown.	2004-06-19

Or happy?  This book leads one into the world of television-commercial perfection, the ultimate celebration and triumph of our consumer oriented society, and suggests such wonderful fulfillment would leave us totally insane.  We're human because of our faults;  getting things right every now and then is a rare delight, not a habit.<br /> In the years since the book and the movie originally appeared, it's become a cult classic for gay and lesbian audiences.  Honestly.  In other words, the so-called \\"feminist\\" movement is as sexist, blinkered and hypocritical as most prejudices the so-called \\"male\\" culture has ever developed.  Geeeee  . . . . .  I guess we're all human, after all.<br /> There's an old test for prejudice, \\"How would you like it if THAT applied to you, rather than someone else?\\"  On that basis, don't tell me that women couldn't identify with \\"perfect\\" men.  If you have any doubts, read a couple of \\"romance\\" novels  --  there's some 18 million printed every month  --  and tell me if the male heroes aren't masculine clones of the perfect housewives portrayed in this book.<br /> In other words, it deals with a very human condition  --  what would we do if confronted with perfection?  That, of course, is the proposition offered by almost every advertisement and commercial ever produced;  use this \\"product\\" to make your life better.  In Genesis the answer comes in two and one-half chapters, \\"We'd mess it up.\\"<br /> Of course, Genesis dealt with an apple.  This novel substitutes the perfect woman for an apple, which supposedly raises the stakes considerably for the average male.  Just how would a man react if he met a perfect woman?  What is the perfect woman?  One whose bra size (measured in centimeters) matches her IQ ?  In other words, it's a savage satire of our media-driven society in which youth, beauty and happiness all come from a bottle.<br /> Does happiness depend on bra size?  And, in the case of a woman, whether a man drives a Dodge Viper or a Dodge Neon?  After you read this book, you'll never again look at a commercial or advertisement without laughing.  Maybe it's just as well the latest film version treats the whole thing as a joke.  Ideas can be disturbing, such as the thougtht that our consumer society just may be insane.<br /> Savage, biting, clever, frightening  --  it's a great book.n the case of a woman, whether a man drives a Dodge Viper or a Dodge Neon?

We're Barry's Boys!&quot;<br /> It sums up the conservative mind set  --  50 years behind the times.  Well, guess what?  This book is the up-to-date version of Barry's Boys;  Gelernter is a thoroughly modern 'Barry Boy' who carefully subtracted 54 from 1994 and came up with the ideal time period of 1940.  He wrote this book as an attack against the Unibomber who almost killed him with a mail bomb in 1993;  the result is more to be pitied than an expression of sadness.<br /> Part of the fault, of course, is &quot;The Media.&quot;  He's very accurate in citing a 1996 report about the Dole campaign, &quot;The crowd hates the reporters, the reporters hate the crowd . . . . . &quot;  True enough, except the same condition existed in 1964 when reporters covering the Republican convention feared for their lives at the hands of delegates.  It not an isolated feeling.  In 1968, my cousin was an actual casualty covering the Democratic convention in Chicago;  in 1970, the police chief in Gallup ordered me not to attend a Democratic rally because he didn't have the manpower needed to protect me from the mob.<br /> Welcome to the real world, Mr. Gelernter.<br /> Despite this, modern America is a vast better than life in 1940, and in 1964.  The great debate this year is whether 2004 is an improvement over 2000;  anyone with an ounce of memory knows it is better than 1992, and 1988, and 1984.<br /> Every social and material advance in society is always condemned by Luddites who are terrified of the future, disgusted by the present and barely tolerant of the past.  They are personified by Ronald Reagan, who would have died in 1981 except for modern medical technology that didn't exist in 1964 when he praised Barry's Boys and their march to the past.<br /> The future is a wonderful place.  I'd like to see as much of it as possible;  I don't have any desire to return to those barren yesteryears when the button shoes, spats and top hats of Bary's Boys were all in fashion.<br /> Anyone who thinks the future means going back to the past will love this book.  The writing quality is delightful, sparkling, all clever technique and devoid of intellect.  If you want to go back to 1910, or even 1940, this book is a delight.  But, if you wake up in the morning looking forward to an exciting new day and a bright new future, it's a waste of time.e.

Some need physical touch to prove their worth;  for others, flirting reinforces those original goals.  Always, always, always, the human condition is to want more, more, more . . . .  This would tend to get complicated, except jealousy also exists to cleanse our passions of spent passions.<br /> Early in the book Luc explains to Dominique &quot; . . . to love and to be loved were essential to being happy.&quot;  She's bored with her life as a university student, which has become an endless routine of study and exams;  she's bored with her lover, a fellow student and their endless routine of bed and banter.  Then, like a bolt of lightning, her ability to interest a successful handsome well-married businessman proves intoxicating, alluring, and seductive.<br /> It's a masterful story by Sagan.  There are so many women who can sympathize with her description of her student lover, &quot; . . . it was quite natural that I should have the weight of Bertrand's body on mine . .  . and that we should be happy together.&quot;  Somehow, she expected more than the equivalent of lying under a rumbled sack of restless potatoes.<br /> It was a dream romance for her, running away to Cannes in Luc's convertible, tender and gentle and new and exciting, until he ordered her to &quot;come along to bed.&quot;  They shared two weeks of bedtime;  and, for this poor girl from the countryside, it was a wonderful rich vacation that could never be repeated.<br /> It was a love affair, with typical French panache and vacant meaning;  she sought meaning in her life, and found only emptiness and futility.  Her legs were open, her heart was closed.  The music of jazz, she discovers, &quot;. . . is a form of accelerated unconcern.&quot;  As she idly drifts into an affair with Luc, being very careful not to upset his wife of whom she is very fond, she realizes she was &quot;trapped, that was it!&quot;<br /> Her only calming thought was the feeling &quot;. . . I was going to have a baby, and the certainty was actually claming.&quot;  No such fear.  There's no baby, no abortion.  This one thought that she might have a baby  --  a baby who would need her  --  passes briefly and she returns to the futile search for a grown man who would want her with the same need as a baby.<br /> By the end, with her life empty of everyone who had been present at the beginning of the story, Dominique realizes &quot;I was a woman who had loved a man.  It was a simple story.&quot;  It was over.  For the French, fun in a bedroom is boring.<br /> It's definitely not a &quot;romance&quot; novel.

It's too much of a shock for people who expect their heroes to be James Bonds or Terminators;  but George Smiley depends on intelligence and persistence instead of brawn and bullying.<br /> It offers a frightening view of the shadowy world of espionage, where betrayal and death are anonymous and government sanctioned.  In a democracy, we like to think of government being open and accessible;  Le Carre says some of the billions spent on spies and spying may well be used to kill without benefit of any Miranda warnings.  The James Bond genre literature is the modern rewrite of medieval morality tales, or at best a Gay 90s (that's 1890s, not 1990s) \\"mellerdrama\\" in which the audience is told when to applause, when to moan, when to laugh and when to be silent.<br /> How real?  Le Carre is often rated as one of the most authentic authors of spy novels.  Who really knows?  Spy experts and expert spies want people to believe they have awesome abilities;  a recent example of US intelligence is the assessment of the weapons of mass destruction and other imminent threats posed by the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq.  A one-time blunder?  Hardly.  Two years before the Berlin Wall collapsed, revealing the truly shabby nature of the East German economy, the US Central Intelligence Agency ominously warned that the East German economy was stronger than that of West Germany.<br /> On that basis, if the US gets into another showdown with Mexico, the CIA will likely be sounding the alarm that Mexico is more powerful militarily than the US.  Intelligence agents made precisely those same claims the last time the US fought Mexico  --  in 1846!  Impossible?  Okay, then how about the reasons for invading Grenada in 1986?<br /> When you consider the role played by \\"intelligence\\" in international relations, in war and in domestic surveillance, then the spies portrayed by Le Carre become ominous.  Read it;  this is a short book, but it's still a wonderful introduction to the Le Carre style.  Then ask yourself, \\"Do we really need these guys?\\"  Once you get an ansewer, ask yet another question, \\"Can we get rid of them?\\"ntelligence agents made precisely those same claims the last time the US fought Mexico  --  in 1846!

It was a dull quiet pettifogging life, with no hint of the so-called French &quot;Resistance&quot; and instead the accounts of various French farmers and tavern keepers who had the single goal of making an easy profit from the German soldiers.<br /> The military life was familiar;  part of a great campaign, filled with petty little rules and regulations and routines.  The waiting was exhausting, not because it was strenuous, but with activities designed to fill time rather than any immediate need.  Then comes the transfer to the Eastern Front, the sudden departure and the psychological spiral down into doom.<br /> It's a very German book.  Every element of military officialdom is condemned;  if nothing else, the traditional German sense of automan obedience to military orders has een shattered.  The story is told with a post-war resentment of officers who survived;  based on a theme that only the decent and intelligent died.  The opportunist bullies who pushed everyone into the vast bottomless black pit of the war against Russia are the real villains.<br /> After World War I, 'All Quiet on the Western Front' condemned the futility of war, but not the leaders who sent millions to the slaughter.  Since World War II, the Germans have resented leaders who sent millions into a hopeless crusade to &quot;save&quot; Europe, Christianity and Western Civilization from the menace of Godless Asiatic Communism.<br /> It helps explain why Germany and France didn't support the American crusade to bring democracy, free enterprise and oil exports to Iraq.  The Germans have been through it, and they are still haunted by that  vast bottomless black pit.still haunted by that  vast bottomless black pit.	2004-06-10

In addition, Arizona is littered with abandoned military facilities and open land.  Most of the northwest quarter of the state is empty and roadless;  setting this story in a land of urban ranchettes is hardly credible.<br /> Setting aside her depiction of Nicolette Scott as an archaeologist, the first jarring element is her description of a single-engine Cessna crashing into a canyon wall and ending up on the floor of the canyon.  Supposedly, the fuselage was intact enough to walk up to the dead pilot to check for signs of life.  It makes me wonder if Davis has ever seen a real aircraft crash, or even read about one.<br /> Another oddity is the focus on rebuilding a World War II B-24 Liberator, which takes place almost overnight.  I'm somewhat familiar with reconstruction of WW II aircraft as done by the Commemorative Air Force (former Confederate Air Force, based in Arizona).  It takes months to accomplish the work she describes.<br /> These flaws, based on my ignorance from personal experience or her unfamiliarity based on limited or flawed research, create jarring anomalies in an otherwise interesting, plausible and feasible story.  Let's put it this way:  if you don't know much about archaeologists, the military, aircraft or the Sonoran desert  --  it could be interesting.	2004-06-06

Interesting, if true.  Roman terror was expressed in the crucifixion of 6,000 slaves after the revolt of the gladiators was crushed in 71 BC.  Fast goes into exquisite technical details about crucifixion, which could take four days for a victim to die.  But he also says even the wealthiest Roman citizens and politicians of that time could walk the common streets without fear of crime.<br /> But the thrust of this book is the quest for freedom.  Fast was a victim of the 1950s McCarthyism, and thus knew personally what it means to be persecuted for being out of step with the ruling authorities.  Fast's views are briefly expressed by Spartacus, &quot;Our law is simple.  Whatever we take, we hold in common, and no man shall own anything but his weapons and his clothes.  It will be the way it was in the old times.&quot;<br /> Old times will never return.  Rome was becoming a society without values or ideals, with the rich addicted to luxury, depravity and wastrel excess and the poor supported by welfare and mindless but increasingly violent games.  He makes the Roman Senate sound a lot like the US Senate of the 1950s;  proud, corrupt, ignorant and arrogrant.  His portrayal of Rome is enough to make anyone cheer Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon to impose authoritative law and order.<br /> The book is a celebration of freedom, without really defining its meaning.  Perhaps unwittingly, he credits Spartacus' followers with the same loyalty that turned Rome into a tyranny;  as one says, &quot;I want you to place me by your side.  Whenever we fight, I want to be at your side.  I will keep you safe.  If we lose you, we lose the whole thing.&quot;  The followers of Caesar shared such values, except they were loyal to Caesar;  today, supporters of President George Bush are equally dedicated.<br /> If you knew what freedom was, you'd fight for it with your bare hands if necessary, the Greeks told the invading Persians hundreds of years before the rise of Rome.  Perhaps &quot;freedom&quot; is impossible to define, since it is different for every individual.  Fast is limited to, &quot;Life is the answer to life.&quot;  But his book expresses the idea that even though the slaves had life, they fought for something more, something intangible, something ill defined, something they all called freedom even though none expressed it with eloquence.<br /> Fast says Spartucus led &quot;an army which suddenly has the knowledge that the victory to which it is committed must change the world, and therefore it must change the world or have no victory.&quot;  He didn't understand the world does not change with victory;  instead, it changes when the seeds of an idea are planted in the minds of people who want more than the mere existence of life itself.<br /> This is a book about ideas, values, commitments and dreams.  It is as valid now as when written in 1951;  many commnents about Rome sound as if they were taken from today's politics.  The great weakness is that Fast thought of freedom as an objective, like capturing a city or a country.  He didn't understand it as a perpetual process, a way to live rather than a target to be reached.<br /> Freedom is like the sunrise;  different every day, sometimes hidden behind storm clouds, sometimes golden across the whole sky in reflections from high clouds, sometimes obscured in mist and dust, sometimes sparkling and clear and bright in the dawn's early light.  It is as easy to explain as the dawn, and just as difficult to understand;  yet, take away either, and our lives are dark and gloomy and filled with dispair.loyal to Caesar;  today, supporters of President George Bush are equally dedicated.<br /> If you knew what freedom was, you'd fight for it with your bare hands if necessary, the Greeks told the invading Persians hundreds of years before the rise of Rome.

The United States has ninety-five thousand miles of coastline and more than a hundred seaports capable of handling large ships.  It is the most active sea-trading nation on earth, accounting for a large percentage of long-distance maritime traffic worldwide and annually accomodating more than sixty-thousand port calls by oceangoing ships, the great majority of which are foreign flagged, owned by offshore companies, and crewed by anonymous sailors  --  almost all of whom come from troubled parts of the world where America is resented, corruption is rife, and authentic documentation can easily be bought,&quot; Langewiesche explains.<br /> The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, focused attention on aircraft smashing into buildings.  Ships are mostly ignored, except for &quot;big bang&quot; fantasies generated by Sept. 11, 2001.  However, an equal or worse disruption of trade is possible simply by running a large oil tanker onto shore in a vulerable region  --  think Exxon Valdez, and the impact of a larger spill on San Francisco, or Seattle, or Boston, or any other of those hundred US seaports.<br /> Can terrorists get a ship?  Pirates already seize dozens of ships every year, and it often takes weeks before the ship is recovered.  Al Qaeda already owns 20 ocean-going ships.  Tankers have inflicted billions of dollars of damage on coastal regions for decades; now, think of this being done deliberately.  The federal building in Oklahoma City was demolished by fertilizer and fuel oil  --  in 1917, a French munitions ship blew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in a blast so massive that it briefly bared the bottom of the harbour.<br /> Despite an impressive bureaucratic and paper facade, ocean shipping is virtually unregulated.  The total chaos of trade is an open invitation to the greedy, the pirates, the terrorists and anyone else with modest means and massive hatreds.  Ships are the world's best cargo carriers, they are the essence of globalization and low prices in the US;  in the hands of the world's world terrorists, they are also awesome weapons.<br /> In brief, it leaves Americans and the industrial world with a choice:  either live with the &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; of ocean-bound terrorism, or develop a system equivalent to NORAD that was created to provide aerial security during the Cold War.<br /> This book is awesome.  Read it, and you'll weep with rage at the $200 billion War on Iraq while leaving the &quot;cargo door entrance&quot; to America as an open, unprotected and deadly invitation to each and every terrorist.trade is an open invitation to the greedy, the pirates, the terrorists and anyone else with modest means and massive hatreds.

Yet, it misses the central element of McCain's character  --  which I think is the key to courage  --  the ability to see what needs to be done, and the willingness to act.  The failing may be Salter's fault;  I doubt if it's due to McCain's endearing and enduring modesty.<br /> Let's start with the premise there are three basic types of personality:  those who see what needs to be done, and do it;  those who see what needs to be done, and wait for someone else to do it; and those who don't know what needs to be done, and complain when anyone else does it.  McCain, like others with courage, are of the first type.<br /> During the Vietnam War, McCain flew missions over Hanoi knowing full well the Vietnamese would fire surface-to-air missiles at his aicraft.  Pilots often saw those missiles coming towards them;  one tactic to avoid being hit was to go into a very sharp turn.  The missile, trying to follow a turning aircraft, tumbled out of control if the turn was sharp enough.  It takes pure courage to play such odds.<br /> One missile finally downed McCain.  He was grievously injured.  Instead of telling his captors what they wanted to hear, McCain began each day with the quiet determination to defy them.  He knew such a decision virtually guaranteed him unrelenting pain.  That is pure courage.  He knew what his honor required, and he did it.  He never expected someone else to pick up the burden he had chosen.<br /> When faced with imminent danger, McCain has always known what needs to be done and has shown the willingness to get it done.  This is the essence of courage.  It applies to everyone McCain cites as an example in courage.  It is the type of choice we face almost every day, our courage is measured on whether we take the easy way out or accept the pain of being true to our inner values.  It is the essence of conservative values.<br /> If read as examples of people who knew what to do when faced with difficult decisions, this book is inspiring and uplifting.  It was written in response to the panic induced by the Bush administration after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001;  when the president fled from one air force base to another and later urged Americans to seal themselves into their homes with duct tape and plastic sheets.<br /> As this book makes clear, you'll never find McCain or any of the people he cites duct-taping the windows of the White House with plastic sheeting or telling people to &quot;go shopping.&quot;  He isn't a man who shouts &quot;Bring it on!&quot; to his opponents;  instead, he gets the job done.  It's what makes him one of the most inspiring and trustworthy political leaders of our time.<br /> Despite my quibbles, it's a book very worth reading if you think of courage as the ability to accept personal responsibility.  It offers an appreciation of the fundamental courage of McCain and those who stand shoulder to shoulder with him.ies to everyone McCain cites as an example in courage.

Tell THAT to Caratacus!	One fact is certain:  nine years after the birth of Christ, the Roman Empire was halted in its eastward expansion in northern Europe when the Germans destroyed three legions in the Battle of Teutoburg Forest.<br /> Little else is certain.  Wells gives a masterful account of the events surrounding this resounding defeat, and suggests it is reason the culture of Europe differs sharply on the east and west sides of the Rhine.  About 1,400 years later, the Germans were crushed in the Battle of Grunwald;  perhaps this is why the culture of East Europe and Russia differs sharply from central and western Europe.<br /> It's tempting to attribute the success or failure of nations and empires to &quot;great men&quot; or &quot;great battles,&quot; as if the outcome of a poker game hinges on the turn of one card rather than years of knowledge, skill, experience and daring.  Real life is usually not so neat.  Wells assumes the Roman legions, who were returning from a summer pacification campaign in Germany, blundered into a clever ambush.<br /> But what if the legions had already been seriously weakened by running battles, similar to the British troops as they withdrew from Lexington and Concord in 1775?  The British won 90 percent or more of the battles during the US War of Independence;  but they over-reached in the campaign that led to their defeat at Yorktown.  The Romans may have encountered their own &quot;Yorktown&quot; in the Teutoburg Forest, rather than a Cannae.<br /> This book presents enough background detail to give readers any number of scenarios for the battle itself, and subsequent history.  Wells offers one reasonable scenario;  any intelligent reader will find enough material to suggest many alternatives.  He claims, &quot;It was a blow from which the empire never recovered.&quot;  It's a pity he can't tell that to Caratacus when Rome conquered England in 43 AD.<br /> Suppose the revolt led by Boadicea in 61 AD had succeeded in liberating England  --  would this have been another turning point in history?  This is the danger of the &quot;Great Man&quot; approach to history;  Wells bases his book on the Roman commander, Publius Quinctilius Varus and the German leader, Arminius.  He overlooks the broader social trends  --  was the Roman defeat in Germany inevitable, which produced the invasion of England a generation later as a consolation prize?  Or was the conqest of England inevitable, to plunder the resources needed to maintain a defensive position along the Rhine?<br /> In brief  . . . . . this book is fascinating, because it details a significant event in world history and allows every reader plenty of their own &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.<br /> It's a great read.is have been another turning point in history?

Without giving away the plot, the book concludes that either Arthur really existed even if no one is sure of what all he accomplished, or else someone with the same name did it all.  In other words, it's good investigative history with a poor understanding of King Arthur.<br /> Although it may not be apparent to an Englishman, King Arthur embodies the finest of the English spirit and attitudes.  He was a great warrior who successfully defended his land against almost impossible odds (to be specific, the Saxon invaders from Germany).  He was the architect of English fair play, justice, equality and democracy  --  why else have a &quot;round table&quot; at which all are equal?<br /> It was the Normans who imposed an absolute monarchy;  the English, in the Magna Carta, told them that no one in England has the right of absolute rule.  The legend warns of the perfidious French in the person of Lancelot, who seduces the Queen.  In today's England, the legend of King Arthur says &quot;this is who we would like to be.&quot;<br /> Ashe provides a cornucopia of facts about the possibilities or likelihood of the real King Arthur, including a tantalizing suggestion the origins of the legend may date back to the beginnings of Stonehenge some 4,000 years ago.  Granted, this may be a latter day addition to the legend, in effect claiming &quot;we've always been like this.&quot;  Or, it may indicate the stubborn English individuality may date much further back than anyone suspects.<br /> It's a pity Ashe didn't examine the legend and it's modern meanings  --  even in the recent American form with Richard Burton in Camelot  --  and how this grew out of the facts he has compiled.  The legends of Beowulf, der Ring des Nibelungen, Gitchee Manitou, the Good Soldier Schweik and others tell a lot about people.  Someday, in a far distant time and place, &quot;legends&quot; of Battle of Britain pilots may merge with Camelot;  think of Squadron Leader Arthur, his Spitfire knights gathering around a table in some pub after battling the Saxons.<br /> Impossible?  In America, legendary stories of George Washington began to arise within a few decades of his death.  Today, true believers swear by such stories.  Such modern legends express the best of America.  It's what legends mean.<br /> History is more than facts  --  it is also meaning.<br /> This book is a rich trove of facts, well worth reading.  Whatever one thinks of King Arthur, this book provides a solid foundation for further analysis.  I'd have preferred more, in the line of &quot;here's what the legend means.&quot;  Even limited as it is, it's well worth reading.s of Beowulf, der Ring des Nibelungen, Gitchee Manitou, the Good Soldier Schweik and others tell a lot about people.

Cleopatra might have changed the world.<br /> Instead, as this rather deficient biography indicates, she did little other than to be remembered in history as one of the world's most intriguing and yet little known women.  She became a legend, similar to King Arthur and Camelot, perhaps because history and biography tends to be written about winners rather than losers.<br /> On the first page of the introduction, Chauveau admits &quot;We do not in fact have any ancient account of her reign, not even a simple biographical summary!&quot;  It makes a rather difficult to write anything relevant about her, especially &quot;beyond the myth&quot; as this book claims to offer, when so little is known about her actual life.<br /> Unfortunately, it's more of a pedestrian account of a formative stage in the Roman Empire than an analysis of what Cleopatra might have achieved.  This is a woman, in the words of the historian Dio Cassius but absent from this book, &quot;captivated the two greatest Romans of her day, and because of the third she destroyed herself.&quot;<br /> Chauveau asserts, &quot;From the purely historical point of view, Cleopatra is thus but an empty figure without an existence of her own, the privileged but ever subordinate partner in the lives of her contemporaries.&quot;<br /> Okay.  At the time of Julius Caesar, Egypt was still independent.  Alexandria, the capital, was the largest, richest, and most prestigious city of that time.  Suppose Cleopatra had succeeded in shifting the center of Roman power to Alexandria?  The result might well have been an eastern-based empire instead of the eventual Euro-centric empire of Rome;  think of the impact of Christianity had the Popes been based in Alexandria instead of Rome.<br /> Cleopatra, by herself, almost made it happen.  As it was, the Gnostic brand of Christianity flourished briefly in Egypt and the Near East.  Had Egypt, or the Near East, been the heart of Christianity there might have been no Islamic religion;  instead, a new religion may have arisen in the West.<br /> This is &quot;an empty figure without an existence of her own&quot;?<br /> Cleopatra may well have been the last sigfnificant challenge to the hegemony of Rome.  Our history is based on what the Romans allowed to survive, not on the achievements of rivals and rebels such as Cleopatra in Egypt and Boudicca in England.  Surely, a biography of Cleopatra should recognize her as a woman who almost changed the world.  For some reason, the book doesn't even include her portrait from a bas relief in the Temple of Hathor, Dandarah, Egypt.<br /> Instead, this book stumbles along without seeming to recognize that Cleopatra came as close as anyone in thousands of years in changing the history of the world.instead, a new religion may have arisen in the West.<br /> This is &quot;an empty figure without an existence of her own&quot;?<br /> Cleopatra may well have been the last sigfnificant challenge to the hegemony of Rome.

Cleopatra might have changed the world.<br /> Instead, as this rather deficient biography indicates, she did little other than to be remembered in history as one of the world's most intriguing and yet little known women.  She became a legend, similar to King Arthur and Camelot, perhaps because history and biography tends to be written about winners rather than losers.<br /> On the first page of the introduction, Chauveau admits &quot;We do not in fact have any ancient account of her reign, not even a simple biographical summary!&quot;  It makes a rather difficult to write anything relevant about her, especially &quot;beyond the myth&quot; as this book claims to offer, when so little is known about her actual life.<br /> Unfortunately, it's more of a pedestrian account of a formative stage in the Roman Empire than an analysis of what Cleopatra might have achieved.  This is a woman, in the words of the historian Dio Cassius but absent from this book, &quot;captivated the two greatest Romans of her day, and because of the third she destroyed herself.&quot;<br /> Chauveau asserts, &quot;From the purely historical point of view, Cleopatra is thus but an empty figure without an existence of her own, the privileged but ever subordinate partner in the lives of her contemporaries.&quot;<br /> Okay.  At the time of Julius Caesar, Egypt was still independent.  Alexandria, the capital, was the largest, richest, and most prestigious city of that time.  Suppose Cleopatra had succeeded in shifting the center of Roman power to Alexandria?  The result might well have been an eastern-based empire instead of the eventual Euro-centric empire of Rome;  think of the impact of Christianity had the Popes been based in Alexandria instead of Rome.<br /> Cleopatra, by herself, almost made it happen.  As it was, the Gnostic brand of Christianity flourished briefly in Egypt and the Near East.  Had Egypt, or the Near East, been the heart of Christianity there might have been no Islamic religion;instead, a new religion may have arisen in the West.<br /> This is &quot;an empty figure without an existence of her own&quot;?<br /> Cleopatra may well have been the last sigfnificant challenge to the hegemony of Rome.  Our history is based on what the Romans allowed to survive, not on the achievements of rivals and rebels such as Cleopatra in Egypt and Boudicca in England.  Surely, a biography of Cleopatra should recognize her as a woman who almost changed the world.  For some reason, the book doesn't even include her portrait from a bas relief in the Temple of Hathor, Dandarah, Egypt.  <br /> Instead, this book stumbles along without seeming to recognize that Cleopatra came as close as anyone in thousands of years in changing the history of the world.	2004-05-05

The lure of the US was the absence of intrusive government, stifling tradition, a static state religion and the old habits and ancient customs of one's fellow villagers.  &quot;Freedom&quot; isn't the right to vote for George Bush or John Kerry  --  it's the right to be left alone, to live as one pleases and to chart one's own future.<br /> Gaddis is also weak on the history he uses to justify the war on Iraq.  The basis of his book is the American reaction to three surprise attacks on US soil  --  the burning of Washington in August 24, 1814; the attack on Pearl Harbour on Dec. 7, 1941; and the attacks of September 11, 2001.

US	49694975	R28G9RQYZRLQDL	0465047548	681475555	Evil: An Investigation	Books	1	2	7	N	N	A flawed look at the nature of evil	This book is banal.<br /> It has all the intellectual depth of Time magazine, a collection of assorted facts and observations without meaning, depth or purpose and stitched together with the pretentious cleverness of a last-minute Internet paste job.<br /> Not once does Morrow define evil, except to say it is bad.  His favorite bad man is Adolf Hitler, who ordered the destruction of 90 percent of Europe's Jews;  he says nothing of the destruction of 95 percent of Native Americans.  In other words,  in the politically correct myopia of Time magazine,  \\"your evil is bad, but my evil is progress.\\"<br /> The weakness of this book is that it reads like a typical collection of tidbits and factoids stitched together by a clever wordsmith who knows little of the origins of the data and nothing of its meaning.  It's very good word candy, playing on emotions with offending anyone by offering an original idea.  Like Time magazine, for which Morrow writes, this book compresses a massive amount of words into a minimum amount of thought.<br /> Okay, I'll offer a definition:  \\"Evil\\" is anything which limits or denies human integrity and dignity.<br /> On that basis, my review is evil.  Why?  My comments likely offend the dignity of Morrow.  Granted, it may be a very trivial evil compared to mass murder, but that is the nature of evil.  It ranges from trivial to terrible.  In my case, my evil is less than allowing unsuspecting readers waste their time or money on this book.  That is the dilemma of evil;  we do not always get to choose between good and evil, sometimes we must choose the lesser of two evils.<br /> Consider, for example, Morrow's assertion, \\"It is presumably evil to incinerate a city filled with innocent civilians  --  as the allies in World War II incinerated  . . . Dresden\\" (to cite one city he listed).  Okay, I remember some elements of 1944;  there was a tremendous belief or hope \\"the war would be over by Christmas.\\"  The total suprise of the Battle of the Bulge shattered those hopes.<br /> Dresden was incinerated about two months after the Bulge;  the Germans had about 16 percent of their forces on the Western front, and 80 percent in the East.  It would have been insane to blithely assume the Germans could not have launched a similar attack in the East.  Dresden was the major transportation hub.  Does Morrow mean it would have been evil to incinerate a German city in the West if it would have prevented the Battle of the Bulge?  Just who was smart enough to foresee the Bulge?  Or to know that such an attack was impossible on the Eastern front?<br /> That is the nature of evil.  The Allies chose the lesser of two evils, in the bombing of Dresden as well as Hiroshima and other cities.  It is the choice a moral person always faces, the necessity to always choose or create the lesser of two evils.<br /> Life is not always so simple as to be a choice between good and evil;  most often, it is a choice among evils.  We sometimes joke about it, as Mae West did when she said, \\"Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before.\\"  In that, she offered far more insight to the nature of evil than anything or everything in this book.<br /> On that basis, if you start by considering my review evil and perhaps even flawed  --  then consider whether this book is a lesser or greater evil than my opinion  --  then you are already way ahead of anything you will learn from this book.<br /> In conclusion  --  it's Time magazine without pictures.hattered those hopes.<br /> Dresden was incinerated about two months after the Bulge;  the Germans had about 16 percent of their forces on the Western front, and 80 percent in the East.

US	49694975	RXKM3IHAHQP55	0465047548	681475555	Evil: An Investigation	Books	1	16	26	N	N	A shallow look at the nature of evil	This book is banal.<br /> It has all the intellectual depth of Time magazine, a collection of assorted facts and observations without meaning, depth or purpose and stitched together with the pretentious cleverness of a last-minute Internet paste job.<br /> Not once does Morrow define evil, except to say it is bad.  His favorite bad man is Adolf Hitler, who ordered the destruction of 90 percent of Europe's Jews;  he says nothing of the destruction of 95 percent of Native Americans.  In other words,  in the politically correct myopia of Time magazine,  \\"your evil is bad, but my evil is progress.\\"<br /> The weakness of this book is that it reads like a typical collection of tidbits and factoids stitched together by a clever wordsmith who knows little of the origins of the data and nothing of its meaning.  It's very good word candy, playing on emotions with offending anyone by offering an original idea.  Like Time magazine, for which Morrow writes, this book compresses a massive amount of words into a minimum amount of thought.<br /> Okay, I'll offer a definition:  \\"Evil\\" is anything which limits or denies human integrity and dignity.<br /> On that basis, my review is evil.  Why?  My comments likely offend the dignity of Morrow.  Granted, it may be a very trivial evil compared to mass murder, but that is the nature of evil.  It ranges from trivial to terrible.  In my case, my evil is less than allowing unsuspecting readers waste their time or money on this book.  That is the dilemma of evil;  we do not always get to choose between good and evil, sometimes we must choose the lesser of two evils.<br /> Consider, for example, Morrow's assertion, \\"It is presumably evil to incinerate a city filled with innocent civilians  --  as the allies in World War II incinerated  . . . Dresden\\" (to cite one city he listed).  Okay, I remember some elements of 1944;  there was a tremendous belief or hope \\"the war would be over by Christmas.\\"  The total suprise of the Battle of the Bulge shattered those hopes.<br /> Dresden was incinerated about two months after the Bulge;  the Germans had about 16 percent of their forces on the Western front, and 80 percent in the East.  It would have been insane to blithely assume the Germans could not have launched a similar attack in the East.  Dresden was the major transportation hub.  Does Morrow mean it would have been evil to incinerate a German city in the West if it would have prevented the Battle of the Bulge?  Just who was smart enough to foresee the Bulge?  Or to know that such an attack was impossible on the Eastern front?<br /> That is the nature of evil.  The Allies chose the lesser of two evils, in the bombing of Dresden as well as Hiroshima and other cities.  It is the choice a moral person always faces, the necessity to always choose or create the lesser of two evils.<br /> Life is not always so simple as to be a choice between good and evil;  most often, it is a choice among evils.  We sometimes joke about it, as Mae West did when she said, \\"Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before.\\"  In that, she offered far more insight to the nature of evil than anything or everything in this book.<br /> On that basis, if you start by considering my review evil and perhaps even flawed  --  then consider whether this book is a lesser or greater evil than my opinion  --  then you are already way ahead of anything you will learn from this book.<br /> In conclusion  --  it's Time magazine without pictures.	2004-04-17

On this basis, the contrast between Lincoln and modern politicians is abundantly relevant;  Kenneally makes abundantly clear that Lincoln was a compromiser, a man concerned with temporary expediency of policy, a man of stubborn persistence and long-held values.  Unlike today's politicians, who like bold decisive actions, he was not a man of unilateral impulsive decisions and hasty judgments.<br /> As Kenneally makes clear, it was the Confederate leaders who recklessly and unilaterally plunged into the Civil War.  Had they accepted Lincoln's compromise efforts, the Old South might still be a cotton-picking slave society;  at the very least, slavery would have lasted for decades past the Emancipation Declaration of Jan. 1, 1863.  <br /> Sound familiar?  Lincoln had his own &quot;radical right&quot; critics; instead of being ruled by their evangelical values, he remained in charge and favored gradualism.  This gradualism may have been beneficial, or it may have been disastrous.  Kenneally writes, &quot;But even Lincoln began to believe, as McClellan delayed, that some Democratic generals didn't really want anything drastic to happen to the Confederacy, fearing that a great victory would encourage the administration to emancipate slaves.&quot;<br /> Perhaps Lincoln's compromise and gradualism meant he selected &quot;cautious&quot; generals rather than plunge an unprepared army into disaster as happened at Bull Run on July 21, 1861.  Except for U.S. Grant, Union generals have always been criticized for caution.  But, Kenneally makes me wonder if Lincoln's conscious or even unconscious &quot;cautious&quot; nature prompted him to select cautious generals.<br /> It'sa basic question that comes to mind from this book:  Were Lincoln's generals incompetent?  Or did his generals merely reflect the innate nature of Lincoln, preferring caution and thoroughness to impulsive and unilateral action?<br /> Lincoln is the worldwide symbol of American greatness, just as Southern slavery typifies the worst of America.  Every nation, every person, has their own good and bad traits;  most everyone understands the complexity of this dual nature.  It is as true today as it was when Lincoln became the nation's leader.  This book admirably illustrates the greatness to which a president can rise.  It is a lesson for this fall's election.  Perhaps there is something valid for a president to be, like Lincoln, &quot;Ever the gradualist . . . . &quot;  Lincoln never wanted to be &quot;a war president&quot; and did as much as he could to avoid war.<br /> On the other hand, Lincoln believed in the &quot;Doctrine of Necessity&quot;  --  which means people act rationally because of enlightened self interest.  It is why he failed to understand the Confederacy would be so stupid as to secede.  Perhaps, had Lincoln been less the Gradualist, less a believer in Necessity, the Civil War might have been averted.<br /> Possible?  It's a couple of issues that Kenneally doesn't examine, but he provides enough background to raise these questions.  It's what makes his book so interesting.  He doesn't try to resolve either issue, he leaves such thinking to every astute reader.<br /> It makes this a most interesting book.	2004-04-02

Once upon a time, during the US war in Vietnam, Shawcross scooped the world media by reporting on the bombing of<br />Cambodia under the secret orders of President Richard Nixon.<br />Naturally, Nixon was furious. Until then, no one knew about the bombing except the Cambodian people, the Pathet Lao, the<br />Viet Cong and most everyone else in the region. Shawcross told the American people. The truth infuriated Nixon.<br />Well, he's done it again. Conservatives will hate this book, because Shawcross deftly points out the long litany of US stupidity<br />that put Saddam Hussein in power, armed him and built up his regime. Maybe they can impeach him. Liberals will hate this<br />book, because he uses devastating details to justify the military destruction of the Hussein regime. Maybe they can impeach<br />him. Intelligent readers will love his writing.<br />Similar to his stories about the secret bombing Cambodia, Shawcross has a fondness for facts. It makes for grim reading, then<br />and now. But, life is never perfect. We can't get perfect omelettes every meal; sometimes we have to settle for scrambled<br />eggs. The underlying theme is basic, simple and utterly relevant to this year's US elections, \\"The responsibility on America and<br />its allies is immense. The only certainty is that they must succeed. The alternatives are too terrible to contemplate.\\"<br />In simplest terms, Shawcross amply demonstrates how all Iraqis lived in terror from the threat that weapons of mass<br />destruction might be used against any region courageous enough to rebel. Hussein had a choice; to comply fully with UN<br />inspection demands and reveal himself as a bully without weapons, or stall the UN and hope it would go away and the Iraqis<br />would be left living in fear of his savagery.<br />One of his most troubling assertion is that \\"US President George W.

The Bush presidency has created almost<br />unprecedented tensions between Europe and the United States.\\" True enough. Only a fool would argue otherwise. It's a sound<br />argument for not re-electing Bush -- provided a \\"really nice guy\\" with a \\"great big smile\\" can be found to faithfully implement<br />Bush's policies.<br />His most troubling example is a quote from a February 1998 speech by President Clinton who asserted, \\"If we fail to respond<br />today, Saddam, and all those who would follow in his footsteps, will be emboldened tomorrow by the knowledge that they<br />can act with impunity, even in the face of a clear message from the United Nations Security Council, and clear evidence of a<br />weapons of mass destruction program.\\"<br />Clinton couldn't act.

Most of this book is a long litany of anti-Americanism,<br />but Revel sadly doesn't understand and obviously can't explain the fundamental reason for such heresy.<br />Spain is the perfect example of why anti-American attitudes are so strong in so many countries; for decades, the United States<br />supported the Franco dictatorship instead of Spanish democrats. American politicians talk a lot about democracy, free<br />elections, the will of the people and free enterprise; but, and this is especially true for conservative politicians, the US<br />government backs almost every non-communist dictator who ever came to power. Truly, American democracy stops at the<br />waters' edge.<br />Revel agrees with President George Bush's assessment, &quot;they hate us for our freedoms.&quot; Yet, this isn't what motivates Osama<br />bin Laden, who wants to overthrow the House of Saud which rules Saudi Arabia with an iron fist, an endless supply of<br />petro-dollars, about 25,000 members of a do-nothing royal family and the unwavering support of the US.<br />Granted, bin Laden wants to replace the incumbent Saudi dictatorship with a religious tyranny that would make the House of<br />Saud look like enlightened monarchs. Revel doesn't understand that intelligent Muslims oppose both the US support of<br />petroligarchs and religious tyranny and would genuinely welcome a true democracy. It's why so many European intellectuals<br />are anti-American; they favor liberty, equality, fraternity more than American complicity with Arab dictators whose grip on<br />power is funded entirely by petrodollars.<br />It's why Americans are so often so welcome in so many lands; as individuals, they are truly nice people. The &quot;ugly American&quot; is<br />the one who thinks only American values, methods, wealth and goals means anything; sadly, official government policy is all<br />too often based on supporting the dictator-of-the-moment instead of long-term democratic ideals. When Eugene Burdick and<br />William J. Lederer wrote &quot;The Ugly American&quot; in the 1950s, they cited the folly of US diplomats and government officials<br />rather than the ordinary decencies of everyday Americans.<br />Granted, President Bush may well have made the boldest and most innovative incursion into the Arab world in at least 500<br />years in his effort to create a truly democratic &quot;shining city on a hill&quot; in Iraq as an example for the entire Arab world. If Bush<br />succeeds, he will have lit the fires of freedom throughout the Arab world.<br />The British and French promised as much after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918; both failed miserably. Syria is the<br />legacy of French involvement; Britain had Iraq. Now the US is trying in Iraq. The Spanish, like many European nations<br />emerging from often inept and irrational dictatorships, learned democracy is a home-grown process -- it cannot be imported.<br />The great debate is how to generate this process. Bush's assumption is based on the promise that people who have never<br />known representative democracy will appreciate it being imposed by armed conquest.<br />Revel could have written a great book explaining why anti-Americanism exists, as well as the alternatives. Instead, he wasted<br />141 pages echoing the platitudes of US Radical Right extremists. There is nothing sadder than a Frenchman echoing the<br />unthinking ideology of a US president who takes pride in never watching the news or reading books. Revel's final chapter<br />concludes, &quot;America is the scapegoat, made to bear all the sins of the world.&quot;<br />True enough, because America is the hope of many peoples yearning to be free. Like every dream elevated to a shining<br />pedestal, disillusion sets in when reality doesn't quite measure up to the fantasies of those who experience the dream.<br />However, Revel is from a society that regards Jerry Lewis as an artistic giant of the last century.

Quite frankly, it's not much of a biography;  I found more details about Luther's life in the 1958 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica;  my disappointment is based on Marty's emphasis of Luther's religious ideas and development instead of the society in which he lived.<br /> On a religious basis, examining how Luther reached the positions he did, the book may be superb;  I'm not a theologian, so I can't judge it on that basis.  Marty is an exceptionally fine theologian, and he may well have done a superb analysis on that basis.

True, some 172 houses had licenses to brew beer;  but, the town also had a newly created university and a printing press (Johann Gutenberg has &quot;invented&quot; the printing press by 1450) .  Talk about casting pearls before swine;  yet, this &quot;pearl&quot; of Luther was part of a worldwide enlightenment that changed the entire nature of Christianity.<br /> Luther lived at the same time as Erasmus, in Roterdam; and when King Henry VIII was challenging the authority of the Pope.  The Roman Catholic church of that era was clearly an early example of globalisation;  this early international insensitivity to local independence led to a rise in nationalism which culminated in the worldwide wars of the last century.  Clearly, northern Europe was reacting against the endemic corruption of the Roman Catholic Church, and in support of the growing nationalism.  Luther was hardly a courageous dissident marching to a different drummer and thus liberating the exploited masses;  instead, he was a brilliant evangelical spokesman for local autonomy and freedom from the dictates of Rome.<br /> It was also a time of bitter anti-Semitism.

Quite frankly, it's not much of a biography;  I found more details about Luther's life in the 1958 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica;  my disappointment is based on Marty's emphasis of Luther's religious ideas and development instead of the society in which he lived.<br /> On a religious basis, examining how Luther reached the positions he did, the book may be superb;  I'm not a theologian, so I can't judge it on that basis.  Marty is an exceptionally fine theologian, and he may well have done a superb analysis on that basis.  The editors at Penguin are not fools, and they don't necessarily target excellent works at my interests;  so if they missed the mark with me, it may well be my loss.<br /> Having said that, Marty gives little attention to the &quot;small, poor, ugly, stinking, hideous, wretched, unhealthy, smoky, full of slop, populated by barbarians and sellers of beer and not by real citizens&quot; town of Wittenberg in 1512 where 2,100 people lived in 400 houses.  True, some 172 houses had licenses to brew beer, so it couldn't have been all bad;  and, the town also had a newly created university and a printing press (Johann Gutenberg has &quot;invented&quot; the printing press by 1450).  Talk about casting pearls before swine;  yet, this &quot;pearl&quot; of Luther was part of a worldwide enlightenment that changed the entire nature of Christianity.<br />The Pope Luther challenged was one of the most corrupt in the history of the Roman Catholic church; it raises the question of how much Luther would have achieved had he challenged an honest Pope.  A second question Marty overlooks  --  what would have been the fate of Catholicism had Luther not challenged its fetid corruption?  <br /> Luther lived at the same time as Erasmus, in Rotterdam; and when King Henry VIII was challenging the authority of the Pope in England.  The Roman Catholic church of that era was clearly an early example of globalisation;  this early international insensitivity to local independence led to a rise in nationalism which culminated in the worldwide wars of the last century.  Clearly, northern Europe was reacting against the endemic corruption of the Roman Catholic Church and in support of a rapidly growing nationalism.  Luther was hardly a courageous dissident marching to a different drummer and thus liberating the exploited masses from a dark tyranny;  instead, he was a brilliant evangelical spokesman for a resolute freedom that sought local autonomy and freedom from the dictates of Rome.<br /> It was also a time of bitter anti-Semitism, one of the enduring failures of Europe.  Marty says Luther's support of such prejudice was unfortunate, but he avoids the issue of what might have happened had Luther developed a religion based on tolerance instead of bigotry.  What if he had preached religious toleration for Islam, even while opposing the Islamic attempt to conquer Europe?<br /> Granted, speculation is not the duty of any competent historian.  But, in my view, passing lightly over the issue of Luther's anti-semitism avoids confronting one of the major faults of Luther and this biography.  Yet, on a religious basis, Marty is succinct, clear and relevant.  As a non-Lutheran, I wanted more history and less theology.<br /> Perhaps there is no better basis for a biography of a major religious leader.  If so, Marty has done a good job.  But it's less than I expected.	2004-02-19

John McCain has a quality that is sadly lacking in the current Bush administration;  he is willing to listen to 'Old Europe' with respect, even though he bluntly disagrees with many of its positions.<br /> This is the central theme of this book;  if America cannot dominate the entire world, it is wise to listen to others with respect.  Instead, Gray says Bush's ambition &quot;to reshape the Middle East comes from the Christian fundamentalist belief that a major conflagration will fulfill biblical prophecies of a catastrophic conflict in the region.  To the extent that it reflects this type of thinking, American foreign policy is itself fundamentalist.&quot;<br /> Gray directly challenges a modern American myth that &quot;Western societies are governed by the belief that modernity is a single condition, everywhere the same and always benign.&quot;  Instead, he says modernity also produces organizations such as al Qaeda, and thus if we are to defeat modern terrorism we must recognize it as a fully modern development.  No one would accuse Bush of being a throwback to the Puritans;  likewise, al Qaeda is not a throwback to the Middle Ages or some earlier time.<br /> The difficulty, Gray writes, is &quot;. . . many Americans believe that all human beings are American under the skin.  On the other hand, they have long viewed the world  --  especially the Old World of Europe  --  as corrupt, possibly beyond redemption.&quot;  Thus, the ideal expressed by President Woodrow Wilson of exporting American ideas to Europe after World War I, and the subsequent isolationism of Republicans in Congress which lasted until Dec. 7, 1941.<br /> How valid is this?  Well, Wilson sent the US Marines to Haiti with the gift of democracy in 1915;  US forces stayed until 1934, providing Haiti with its most prosperous and peaceful era of the past century.  After the Marines came home, Haiti collapsed into chaos and then a tyranny which lasted until 1986.  President Bill Clinton sent US forces to Haiti in 1994, then pulled them out six months later.  The success of America's long effort at &quot;nation building&quot; is reflected in today's ongoing headlines of Haitian horror.<br /> We live in a world of chaos.  As long ago as Euripides, it was recognized that knowledge cannot undo fate and virtue gives no protection against disaster.  Gray urges that we return to these values, and thus understand the complexity, diversity and tolerance of life.  But he adds, &quot;Though we can imagine such a world, it is hard to imagine anything resembling it coming about by design.  The proselytising fury of faith  --  religious and secular  --  forbids any peaceful evolution.<br /> He says, &quot;The most that humans can do is to be brave and resourceful, and expect to achieve little.  Very likely we cannot revive this pagan view of things;  but perhaps we can learn from it how to limit our hopes.&quot;<br /> It's a grim view of the future, something almost out of 'Brave New World.'  Unfortunately, he supports his pessimism with clear, logical and frightening logic;  in short, science gives us wonderful rewards at the cost of our souls.  It's not a new idea;  but, like the best of the science which he deplores, Gray thoroughly modernizes the old Faustian legend.<br /> It's a somber view of the future.  Interesting, and fascinating, if true.  This book will give any reader a lot to think about.t US forces to Haiti in 1994, then pulled them out six months later.

Castro made a triumphal procession across the country as a godlike liberator, just as Washington was hailed as the greatest man of his times.  It is nice to celebrate the end of a war  --  think of George Bush strutting across the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, wearing a borrowed flight suit with the banner 'Mission Accomplished' in the background.  But, freedom is much more;  it generates an ecstasy that stirs every emotion the heart, not merely the limited glory of victory, but also an unbounded hope for a better and brighter future without fear, fright or futility.<br /> Washington, with a knowledge and wisdom rare among revolutionary leaders, went back to his farm.  The ultimate tribute came from King George III, who personally knew something about the temptations and dangers of power, when he said that if Washington actually did return to his farm \\"he will be the greatest man in the world.\\"<br /> Think of Cuba today had Castro retired to a little rancho and learned how to cut cane instead of crushing gusanos.  In Haiti, Jean Bertrand Aristide should have gone back to the priesthood after he tossed out the Duvalier regime.  The list of \\"liberators\\" who seize power and try to impose their own rules is almost universal;  Washington patterned his retirement after the Roman hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus \\"who, victorious, left the tented field, covered with honor, and withdrew from public life, to enjoy civium cum dignitate.\\"<br /> Unlike Cincinnatus, who was twice recalled from his farm to become dictator, Washington was recalled from his farm only to establish an enduring legacy of democracy.  It is a rare quality.  Weintraub describes those perilous times with painful detail.<br /> Painful?  It was a time of chaos in America, much to the satisfaction of the English who thought the independent colonies would collapse of internal confusion.  Congress was even flakier then than now.  A third of Americans were loyalists who had supported King George;  Washington understood the power of reconciliation rather than the retribution of describing anyone who had not supported him as an enemy.<br /> In 1783, Washington kept urging greater power for the central government.  He could have become dictator and imposed his own regal solution;  instead, he stepped back and let the people and Congress, however slow in their many imperfections, gradually work out the system that now exists.  Everyone was slow to listen, waiting until 1787 to even begin writing a new Constitution.  But, after trying all other solutions, they finally listened to Washington.  The old boy may have had wooden (or ivory) teeth, but there was no wood between his ears.<br /> Weintraub has written a masterful book outlining the chaos, confusion and cupidity of the time;  explaining how from the primordial soup of American independence a resolute democracy emerged.  This book helps explain the resolute independence of the American spirit, nicely summed up by a departing British officer, \\"These Americans are a curious, original people;  they know how to govern themselves, but nobody else can govern them.\\"<br /> It was a wonderful tribute to an exceptional people, and this book nicely explains the mood of the times.from his farm only to establish an enduring legacy of democracy.

US	49694975	RNJOJ6U5ADWIY	067401085X	460593662	The Parthenon (Wonders of the World)	Books	5	4	7	N	N	When beauty was in style  --  and how it was trashed	One chilly February morning, just as dawn was arriving and the shops and offices were still clad in the cold grey of the fading night, I saw by the dawn's golden glow the full splendour of the Parthenon floating serenely above the narrow streets of Athens.<br /> The sun had risen just enough to light the Parthenon.  For a moment or so it floated;  the Acropolis could have been a cloud with the Parthenon as a vision of the front door to the home of the gods.  It was a perfect metaphor for the reputation of ancient Athens as a city committed to beauty, elegance, grace and the sensitivity to express artistic values.<br /> Mary Beard has done a superb job in this concise and poignant history, undoubtedly the finest structure of its kind in the world.  The ancients didn't consider it one of the Seven Wonders of the World, they seem to have based their values on volume instead of quality.  Perhaps the Parthenon, even today in its ruined state, should be considered first among the Seven Beauties of the World.<br /> Her book is a treasure for anyone who has visited the Acropolis;  it is essential for anyone who plans to visit Athens and do more than drink ouzo in some seedy taverna.  It's more than a bare-bones history;  she recounts the scandals in getting it built, and the subsequent sins of omission and commission during the past 20 centuries during which this gem was defaced.<br /> Maybe my view is warped because of my first magic view;  however, I still regard it as a gift of the gods which mortal humans have spoiled.  Beard doesn't offer any such speculation;  instead, she does offer a nuts-and-bolts history of this gem from the past.  That is the strength of her book, she ignores the nonsense and concentrates on facts.<br /> It is also the weakness, in my view.  The history is brief but fascinating, but she doesn't understand the psychic importance of Athena to the Athenians.  For a comparison, think of the 'Liberty Enlightening the World' statue in New York harbour and its significance to all Americans, whether they have seen it or not.  Both statues embody the ideals of the society in which they are displayed;  I suggest when you read this book, to keep this comparison in mind to get a full appreciation of just how much each means to the world.<br /> England, of course, hasn't built a monument since Stonehenge.  England builds little statues to honor its heroes;  think of the Albert Memorial.  Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square is a mere 59 columns short of a full Parthenon.  How about the Millenium Dome to celebrate two centuries of ? ? ?  The Statue of Liberty wasn't an American idea, it was a gift from France.  It's not easy to come up with an artifact that expresses the ideals of a society through time.<br /> The Parthenon is a timeless monument.  Regardless of what or how you think of it, this book will add to your understanding, appreciation and enjoyment.  When you think of how many of today's architectural &quot;gems&quot; will still be visited 2,500 years from now, it gives you an appreciation of what the Athenians accomplished.<br /> Beard tells you how they did it, and then what happened.

American prisoners, when captured, were housed in appalling conditions of cruelty, suffering and starvation.  Most died.  As one victorious officer pointed out, &quot;Wherever our armies have marched, wherever they have been encamped during the last campaign, every species of barbarity has been executed.  We planted an irrevocable hatred wherever we went, which neither time nor measures will be able to eradicate.&quot;<br /> Those victorious troops were British and Hessian, they were fighting American rebels.  By December 1776, General Washington had lost 90 percent of the men who were in his army during the previous summer.  British commanders were moving hard, fast and decisively, defeating the Americans in battle after after.  Had colonists dug in to fight, the rebellion would have ended in one quick charge by &quot;the thin red line.&quot;<br /> Instead, Washington kept running.  At least one spy in his headquarters kept the English fully up-to-date.  By any reasonable standard, the rebellion was over.  The Hessians, by any standard the best troops in the world, settled in comfortably at Trenton for the winter.  They had fought hard, won much, deserved a rest and expected to be going home soon.  The Revolution was all but lost.<br /> Instead, during a howling nor'easter storm, Washington led the tattered remnants of his shattered army across the Delaware River.  This time, when the smoke cleared at Trenton on Christmas Day, nearly a thousand Hessians were either dead or prisoners.  Instead of revenge, Washington issued orders that the Hessians &quot;were innocent people in this war, and were not volunteers, but forced into this war.&quot;  He ordered them to be treated as friends.<br /> In 12 weeks after Trenton, Washington won battle after skirmish after skirmish.  He wrecked the British plans for a quick end to the war, and revived the forlorn hopes of the rebels.  Washington went on to lose battle after battle, but Americans never again lost hope.  Eventually, English politicians got tired of the American quagmire and quit.<br /> Washington's policy reflected the attitude of the Continental Congress. As John Adams explained, &quot;I know of no policy, God is my witness, but this  --  Piety, Humanity and Honesty are the Best Policy.  Blasphemy, Cruelty and Villainy have prevailed and may again.  But they won't prevail against America, in this contest, because I find the more of them are employed, the less they succeed.&quot;<br /> How effective was it?  Well, almost 14,000 Hessians survived the war in America.  Of these, almost 3,200 chose to stay in America.

Soros survived the Nazis and Communists in Hungary, got to the US in 1956 and had enough business acumen to become a billionaire.  Bush is the son of Old Establishment money and political patronage who never earned a cent in his life, always relying on his Daddy's wealthy friends.  Soros became rich by understanding the motivations and actions of others;  Bush became president because political advisers Karl Rove and James Baker saw him as a pliant puppet,<br /> Does that make either man a foreign affairs expert?  No.<br /> Soros' foreign expertise comes from the $500 million he spends every year to encourage genuine democracy around the world.  Bush's policy comes from a narrow group of American Supremacist reactionaries who advocate a unilateralist approach which other nations may join but not influence.  Therein lies the difference between the two:  Bush has an America First policy, Soros advocates cooperative international solution.<br /> Who is right?  Well, in the world of business, Soros' ideas of cooperation instead of confrontation works well.  He outlines his approach with an articulate skill in this book, criticizing the Bush mistakes and saying other nations can offer invaluable help.  Soros is the modern equivalent of President Woodrow Wilson who created the League of Nations, a brilliant idea which failed due to American isolationism and its failure to counter aggression.  Like Wilson, Soros believes in rational people making intelligent decisions.<br /> In brief, it is the essence of his book.  I recently re-read 'Common Sense' by Thomas Paine, the 1776 book that was the intellectual foundation for the American Declaration of Independence.  Soros has written the modern international equivalent, as well-reasoned, eloquent and impassioned as Paine.  However, there is a difference.  Paine faced King George III, who may have been nuts but was obviously very astute.  Today, America faces an amorphous irrational terrorism based on an utterly insane religious fundamentalism.<br /> Events in Iraq, Afghanistan and other Mid-East countries may well have an impact on the 2004 election.  The choice will be between American Supremacist in a \\"follow us or get ready to fight us\\" tactics or a policy based on American Leadership with a \\"we'll respect your views\\" type of consultation and cooperation.<br /> Soros has been there.  As a Jew in his native Budapest, he survived in the impact of the \\"Germany Above all Others\\" policy.  He survived the utterly irrational communist fundamentalism.  America made him vastly rich.  He has been funding democratic programs in Europe since the 1980s.  It's an incredible personal schooling on which to base his views.<br /> The 2004 election debate will likely be on the economy, with foreign policy as the runner-up.  Much of the talk show debate involves extremists screaming at each other;  Soros offers an intelligent alternative to the current quagmire.lent, as well-reasoned, eloquent and impassioned as Paine.

US	49694975	R2I6EETIX3M61K	0743255712	565314037	Winning Back America	Books	5	23	29	N	N	Here is new hope for America!	The Berlin Wall came down without a single shot being fired because people on the other side wanted to be like us, Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean writes in this book, &quot;not because they were afraid of us.&quot;<br /> He cites former presidents Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy who &quot;inspired and mobilized other countries because they believed there was no more powerful force on earth than that of free people working together.&quot;  It's one man's opinion, and obviously Dean hopes a majority of Americans share his view of America as a free nation inspiring people throughout the world as a beacon of hope and justice typified by the Statue of Liberty, formally known as &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World.&quot;<br /> There is an alternate view.  The Bush administration portrays America as being great because Americans had the courage to accomplish what seemed impossible to the less courageous  --  a heroism that didn't need government programs such as Social Security, Medicaid, jobless aid, education programs, environmental protection and dozens of other programs designed to protect, preserve and enhance life for Americans and all people.<br /> It's what this year's election is all about.  Bush is a decent man, as Dean learned when both were governors;  but, the ideologues around Bush want to take this country back a hundred years to a social system based on survival of the fittest.  Dean writes, &quot;. . . . . it is the very same fear that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson spoke about more than two hundred years ago:  the fear that economic power would one day try to seize political power.&quot;  A century ago, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt became a trust buster who smashed the monopolies.  In contrast, Bush rewarded the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans with 42 percent of his tax cuts and plunged the federal budget into a massive new deficit.<br /> Instead of democracy and a free economy inspiring people, which is why East Germans dared to &quot;tear down this wall&quot; which long divided Germany, right wing ideologues think democracy can be imposed at gunpoint in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /> Whose fault is this?  Dean writes, &quot;By being afraid to stand up to the Republicans and their radical agenda, the Democrats have actually empowered the radical right.&quot;  It's why he represents the democratic wing of the Democratic Party, in contrast to some of the other candidates who voted early and often for the Republican agenda.  Dean admits, &quot;A lot of Democrats have given up on their party.&quot;  He wants to restore faith in the Democratic Party as representative of ordinary Americans.<br /> Dean, as the Democratic nominee, will offer a clear alternative to Bush ideologues on all significent policical issues.  This book clearly outlines substantial policy differences, not merely on the unilateralist doctrine of pre-emptive war against countries deemed &quot;evil&quot; by Bush's ideologues, but on all social and political issues.<br /> This book, like his campaign, is based on Dean's belief that &quot;I don't think the voters want George W. Bush's policies.  I don't think they want me-tooism either.:  More than anything else, they want someone to stand up to George W. Bush, explain to the American people why he is wrong, and treat them like adults.&quot;d to &quot;tear down this wall&quot; which long divided Germany, right wing ideologues think democracy can be imposed at gunpoint in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan.  <br /> Whose fault is this?

He has an impeccable record of defending, explaining, respecting and advocating civil rights.  He is one of those precious few in every society with the courage to challenge the power of government to boss people around.  He functions at the level of you, me and us.<br /> Some politicians have a different outlook;  they think they deal in great national and global issues on which the future of all mankind hinges.  They are wrong, of course.  It's not because they are evil, though some are certainly evil.  It's because the nature of representative democracy requires politicians to represent all of the people.  Like any &quot;averaging&quot; system, it excludes anyone who is not in the white bread and vanilla pudding &quot;middle&quot; of society.  In a free society, individuals are free to choose such exotic ideas as Thai red-curry chicken or a sunny Provencal daube.<br /> The US Constitution and its Bill of Rights wasn't handed down to us by ancient wise politicians;  it is a set of values of the American people.  Personally, I have great faith in the individual wisdom of Americans.  Even if everything Hentoff says comes true, I'm confident a new &quot;American Revolution&quot; will root out such tyranny.  Hentoff is not so sanguine, he stresses the &quot;grass roots of the Constitution&quot; and urges freedom loving Americans to act now.  Ashcroft needs to be reminded his sworn duty is to uphold the Constitution, not to cave into the fears of the chicken-hawks in the Bush administration.<br /> Normally, civil rights is a liberal issue.  But not this time.  Hentoff repeatedly quotes the leading conservatives in Congress, plus right-wing papers such as The Washington Times.  A lot of people across the politiocal spectrum are genuinely upset about the threat to our basic rights.  It is an issue that concerns all those interested in individual freedom, and his book draws from an eclectic range of sources.<br /> Okay, so Attorney General John Ashcroft says his trashing of civil rights is necessary to fight terrorism.  Under the new laws, Hentoff points out that a person who stands peacefully outside an abortion clinic to urge women not to have an abortion could technically be charged as a terrorist and lose all of their civil and legal rights.  Will this happen?  Well, it's not likely (cross-your-fingers) under Ashcroft  --  but he (hopefully) isn't Attorney General-for-life.<br /> Far-fetched?  Well, remember the 1930s when mobsters weren't convicted of being killers?  Convictions were based on income tax charges.  Remember the Mississippi murders of civil rights workers in the 1960s?  Their murderers were not convicted of murder; they were nailed for violating the civil rights of the victims.  The lesson is that if the government wants to convict a person, they will find a way.  In this book, Hentoff shows how the government now has hundreds of new ways of convicting any individual who upsets these new absolute monarchs of madness.  King George III should have been so lucky!!!<br /> Hentoff offers enough examples to frighten everyone who values American rights.  What can you do on an individual basis?  Well, people who love liberty in many communities have persuaded local governments to enact policies refusing to cooperate with the police state envisioned by Ashcroft.  This book provides dozens of reasons to take such action.ctrum are genuinely upset about the threat to our basic rights.

His portrayal of just three founders make today's politicians look as wimpy as a babble of Girl Scouts quibbling about their last box of broken peppermint cookies.  Pardon me, I don't mean to insult any Girl Scouts;  given their ability to sell cookies, they could probably do better than today's &quot;polluticians.&quot;<br /> He links many pecadilloes of the men who created America to modern times;  I think, but I'm not sure, that he wants to contrast the founding idealism of the birth of a new democracy to the banal and petty politics which now infect public life.  In reality, this book gives me hope that Americans are far better than their politicians  --  in 1787, when they were writing the Constitution, and today when so many politicians are trashing it.<br /> Vidal is witty, incisive and a delight to read.  One of the warm fuzzy images of Washington shows him wrapped in warm winter clothes as he kneels in prayer in the snow at Valley Forge.  Why was Washington praying?  Perhaps, as Vidal explains, because he was &quot;dealing with a crooked Congress that was allowing food and supplies to be sold to the British army while embezzling for themselves money appropriated for 'the naked and distressed soldiers,' as Washington referred to his troops.&quot;<br /> In other words, this isn't your usual history.  Washington describes Congress as a place with &quot;venality, corruption, prostitution of office for selfish ends, abuse of trust, perversion of funds from a national to a private use, and speculations upon the necessities of times pervade all interests.&quot;  It explains why today's so-called conservatives want to go back to the values of the Founding Fathers.<br /><br /> He may be too cynical.  For example, how competent was Washington?  Vidal quotes one British observer who wrote, &quot;Any general in the world other than General Howe would have beaten General Washington;  and any general in the world other than George Washington would have beaten General Howe.&quot;<br /> These are the people who created America.  Vidal fails to understand the world in general is run by mediocrity.  He should know;  he was once a friend of President John Kennedy, a brilliant showman with little substance.  It is how the world functions, including the birth of the American system of government from 1775 to 1815.  Some politicians are all image and no ideas;  great politicians dress noble ideas with inspiring images.<br /> Vidal's weakness is that he understands little of England of the era;  if he had, he'd understand the American Revolution as a major reform effort of a basically good system rather than the invention of something new.  On this basis, reform (Jefferson called it revolution) is a permanent patriotic duty of all.<br /> Setting these quibbles aside, Vidal does what every good journalist should do  --  he afflicts the comfortable, comforts the afflicted.  He makes you think about today's politics in terms of the idealism and pettiness of the founding fathers.  In 1789, with the new Constitution ratified, the business of governing meant &quot;the days of discussing Hume and Montesquieu were over.&quot;  In its place came back-room deals and log rolling for special interests.<br /> He offers a refreshing reminder that America was founded on a mixture of idealism and the venality of opportunist politicians.  Little has changed.

There are at least four million plants and animals on earth, which means there are four million ways of staying alive.  Yet, Cahill is devoting a series of books to the dubious proposition that only half-a-dozen or so really matter.<br /> The book expresses a basically good idea  --  how did our modern world come to be?  His hypothesis contends the Greeks invented it, he rounds up the usual collection of facts to prove his assumption.  It's impressive, and it can't be denied the Greeks came up with some of the world's finest arguments to support democracy.  But, they also came up with fine arguments against democracy; Plato's arguments for &quot;rule by the best&quot; hobbled the world for at least 2,500 years.<br /> Plato tried to provide answers; for example, in ranking government from the finest to the worst, he ranked aristocracy as the best.  Next came military rule, then a business oligarchy, then the rule by inexperts which he called democracy;  and, worst of all, tyranny.  It's hardly surprising church and secular leaders warmly endorsed Plato's views for the past 2,500 years.<br /> The book is an interesting compilation of some Greek ideas.  He writes, &quot;fate was central to Greeks and Romans, hope is central to Jews and Christians.&quot;  Yet, democracy is an exuberant expression of hope.  Unfortunately, Cahill fails to reconcile a government based on hope with the idea the Greeks believed in fate.  As in his narrow argument about the Irish saving civilization, he ignores the full panopoly of Greek ideas and accomplishments and the impact of non-Greek ideas.<br /> Direct democracy failed in Greece.  Modern representative democracy evolved in an unbroken but greatly tortured path from the equally ancient &quot;althing&quot; of Scandinavia.  In the late eighteenth century, the debate in England and America about the nature of democracy cited Greece as a diffuse distant dim ideal to justify preserving and/or changing the status quo.  On a practical basis in America, the Iroquois confederacy may have had more impact than anything from Greece.  You'll never know from this book.<br /> Life adapts itself to different environments, as Charles Darwin discovered when he saw finches.  Likewise, democracy adapts itself to different environments, which is why England and the United States are equally democratic in profoundly different ways.  You'll never know from this book.<br /> Greek culture was inherited from Asia Minor, Crete, Phoenicia, and Egypt  --  just as American culture is a world-wide amalgam.  The tragedy of ancient Greece, still a destructive feature of the Balkans, is the inability to unite in any common cause except a passion to destroy each other.  You'll never learn it from this book.<br /> The ancient Greek genius was to question everything  --  not to offer answers.  Read &quot;Antigone&quot; and tell me the correct answer.  It's a pity Cahill didn't focus on this issue, and leave the thinking and conclusions to the reader.  Greek failures may well be of far more use to us today than their limited and brief successes.<br /> Granted, near the end of the book in discussing the decline and fall of Greece, he outlines a disturbing parallel in modern politics, &quot;Though the gods were more and more loudly invoked, the prayers rang hollow, the appeal to conscience turned mute, and any reference to social justice tended to be met with a knowing smirk.&quot;<br /> The Greeks turned cynical as their society declined, just as many Americans are now cynical about their own &quot;Smirker-in-Chief.&quot;  The Greeks had no answer, Cahill offers none.  If the Greeks really mattered, we could learn from them.  If not, this book offers as much insight as comparing the first-class and steerage-class menus on the S.S. Titanic.<br />Our civilization is a lot more complicated than &quot;one people solves all.&quot; You'll never learn it from this book.in America, the Iroquois confederacy may have had more impact than anything from Greece.

Chomsky is brilliant in summing up the world as it now exists, but he overlooks the questions of \\"why\\" as well as the Quislings who empower and enable the overlords of the marketplace.<br /> Let's start with the strong points.  The book doesn't \\"expose\\" a secret cabal, such as the Protocols of Zion or the Trilateral Commission.  It's like a good mystery story;  Chomsky picks up facts from the public record, puts them together and proclaims in the classic style of a long-forgotten and very apt Doonesbury strip, \\"Guilty!  Guilty!  Guilty!\\"<br /> \\"Guilty!\\" is certainly a mild term to describe US machinations in dominating the economies and societies of many nations.<br /> One of the weakest points is his lack of understanding of the power of Quislings.  Canada, for example, once had a strong independent streak  --  the 1911 election campaign was won on the issue \\"No truck or trade with the Yankees.\\"  But in World War II, an American-born and educated Liberal member of the government inextricably tied the Canadian war economy to the US in the Ogdensburg Agreement.<br /> After the war, this policy was accelerated.  Canadians rebelled in 1957 with the election of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. In response,  the Kennedy administration loaned its top political operatives to the Liberals to drive Diefenbaker from power.  It worked admirably.  Canada is now a one-party country with a branch-plant economy.  Liberals have run the national government for all but 18 of the past 70 years, and now control provincial governments covering 80 percent of the people.<br /> A similar obsequious servitude is true in many countries.<br /> In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair is America's poodle.  In Mexico, President Vicente Fox was American-trained, American-employed and American-owned before being elected and establishing a \\"special relationship\\" with President George Bush.  He's not even a poodle;  he's more like a chihuahuita -- an excitable little bundle of snippy dippy barks.<br />It's how  business, religions and other empires are always built.  In every society, at least 10 percent of people are chronic kickers who will join any outsider.  Empires are built on luring that dissatisfied 10 percent to overturn the old regime.<br /> Surely Chomsky has seen this in his own MIT classes  --  from teacher's pets to those who are perennial doubters of his wisdom and learning.<br /> Except for updating the list of the guilty, his observations are old.  In the 1920s, Will Rogers read in the newspapers of US gunboats being sent up the Yangtzee River \\"to defend American interests.\\"  In response, Rogers asked how Americans would feel if China sent its gunboats up the Mississippi to defend the Chinese laundries in St. Louis.  Chomsky is simply somewhat more acerbic.<br /> There's an old saying that it takes two to make a fight.  Well, it takes two to make an empire  --  those who want to rule, and those who see great advantage in being ruled by the rich and powerful.  It's like the \\"patrone\\" society in Latin America;  many people see a definite advantage in being subject to a strong dynamic ruler.<br /> Okay, so Bush is a chowderhead.  Despite that, many foreigners see a definite advantage in being part of a strong dynamic American society.  Likewise, Vidkun Quisling thought it was a great advantage to be part of a dynamic Nazi society.  In Canada, the  sachems of the Liberal Party have long favored economic union with the US.  It's the same for Tony Blair, Vicente Fox and dozens of other leaders.  There's no end of volunteers who want to serve the rich and powerful.<br /> Chomsky does a brilliant job in outlining American complicity in building an empire.  But, he also needs to understand the motives of collaborators.  He could start with Liberal politicians in Canada, or he could ask why so many French were enthusiastic collaborators with the Germans during World War II.  He needs to understand that it takes two to make a hegemony.<br /> He is brilliant in painting a portrait in black and white;  unfortunately, he limited his palette to one color.r II.

US	49694975	R1NWF5IHIJ998B	0802713262	382334052	Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World	Books	5	2	4	N	N	A bitter ecological tale for our time	This is a fascinating book.<br /> It's also very sad, because it illustrates the ability of modern people to almost unconsciously wipe out the natural resources of our planet.  Codfish were once the &quot;buffalo&quot; of the oceans  --  big, fat, useful and dumb.  As one early explorer wrote, to catch cod all you need do is lower and bucket into the water and haul it back up full of fish.  Sorta like buffalo in the days when passengers could shoot them from the windows of passing trains as a harmless sport intended solely to break the boredom of the trip.<br /> Yes, this book is a bitter ecological tale for our time.<br /> It is also a wonderful history of a marvelous fish.  Kurlansky obviously had fun writing it, and his love of cod shows in the comfortable style of his writing.  He delves into word origins for the different ways used to describe cod, and he plays with the history of a dozen or so nations to illustrate the impact one fish had on entire peoples.  Plus, he includes dozens of recipes by which cod was cooked for generations.<br />But he also explains why such an international treasure has almost vanished.<br /> &quot;Whatever steps are taken, one of the greatest obstacles to restoring cod stocks off Newfoundland is an almost pathological collective denial of what has happened,&quot; Kurlansky writes near the end of the book.  &quot;Newfoundlanders seem prepared to believe anything other than they have killed off nature's bounty.&quot;<br /> What happened?  Kurlansky writes that &quot;One Canadian journalist published an article pointing out that the cod disappeared from Newfoundland at about the same time that stocks started rebuilding in Norway.<br /> &quot;Clearly the northern stock had packed up and migrated to Norway,&quot; he adds.  If this is the Canadian attitude, in one of the self-proclaimed best educated and wealthiest of nations, it's not hard to understand why and how Third World nations have environmental problems.  My personal experience with a similar depletion is in the Sea of Cortez, where Mexican fishermen have taken about 20 years to just about exterminate the sharks.<br /> Shrimp boats, based in Puerto Penasco, have likewise decimated the shrimp.  Who's to blame?  The United States, of course, because the Americans built dams on the Colorado River which prevents the river water from reaching the sea.<br /> There's always someone else to blame.<br /> As I said earlier, it's a sad book.  Yet, it is an excellent one and perhaps one of the most appropriate to read in terms of what is fast happening to our marine life.  Cod are invisible, not like cute furry little baby seals which so excited Europeans a few years ago when they saw how Canadians clubbed them to death to avoid marking the fur.  If the future of our world depends on cute pictures on TV, then our future is truly in deplorable shape.<br /> But, the fact this book exists and is written with elegance, style, wit and great insight, may persuade thick-headed politicians that even &quot;invisible&quot; wildlife deserves protection from our greed and ignorance.  If not, and having known many politicians for many years I'm not optimistic, it is a beautiful elegy to a noble fish.<br /> What happens when a native species disappears?  Well, two centuries ago the US Southwest had some of the world's finest grasslands.  Then came the Russian Thistle, an almost useless weed that choked out the grass.  Now we celebrate this import in song, &quot;See them tumbling along . . . . . the tumbling tumbleweeds.&quot;<br /> It happens.with a similar depletion is in the Sea of Cortez, where Mexican fishermen have taken about 20 years to just about exterminate the sharks.<br /> Shrimp boats, based in Puerto Penasco, have likewise decimated the shrimp.

Early in the book, he announced the great achievements at Chaco Canyon were &quot;between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries A.D.&quot;  In reality, the Chaco Culture (as it is properly known) began in the late 800s and collapsed about 1110 A.D.<br /> He regards the Monroe Doctrine as an American idea, enacted at a time when the United States had four frigates to enforce its provisions.  In reality it was a post-Napoleonic British initiative, designed to prevent any European power developing an empire somewhere in the Americas that might someday challenge Britain.<br /> He says in Texas &quot;you can see people in what amounts to the state dress:  Stetson and cowboy boots.&quot;  State dress?  From personal experience, &quot;Stetson and cowboy boots&quot; are common throughout the Southwest US and northern Mexico.<br /> When describing the Maya, who flourished until about 1000 A.D., he writes &quot;the system was designed not so much to communicate as to keep secrets.&quot;  So?  That was true of European society in the same time span;  it was a common feature of most societies.  People kept secrets to protect their advantages, the era of the tell-all blabbermouth didn't begin until the Protestant Reformation.  The Scientific Revolution was based on sharing knowledge, not on keeping secrets.<br /> He is fascinated by Tierra del Fuego, almost ignores Canada, and completely ignores what became the industrial heartland of North America because of neaby natural resources amd a superb network of lakes, rivers and canals.  It's as if a history of England said Hadrian's Wall was built in 400 A.D., emphasized the Isle of Man, ignored Cornwall and treated the Magna Carta as a quaint scrap of paper.<br /> One of his most curious assertions is that &quot;it is a mistake to suppose that great events must have great causes or long drawn-out origins.&quot;  On this basis, the Roman invasion, Queen Boudicea, Hadrian's Wall, Hastings, the Magna Carta and the Armada are relatively unimportant events in forming today's sense of English identity.  Or  . . .  what does Christ, who lived 2000 years ago, have to do with today's church?<br /> He also overlooks the fact that for much of the European occupation of the Americas, Latin America was the richest and most dynamic region.  It wasn't until the Industrial Revolution that North America began its rise to the dominance, a time span of 150 years out of the 500 years of European involvement.<br /> In other words, the book is packed with oddball observations, strange conclusions and whimsical flights of fancy. It made me wonder if Fernandez-Armesto has ever visited America;  it reads like an Englishman's blinkered vision from the confines of his fusty, musty, dusty private club.<br />I doubt if many Americans will recognize the view of this hemisphere that he offers.  Granted, there are some rare flashes of insight, but they are few, far between, and well-disguised.

She's not bragging or complaining, simply stating a fact that by then is very obvious and logical.  Deep sea fishing isn't easy, it's one of the toughest and most hazardous jobs available;  but she has a love for it, and this book is her tribute to a way of life that is beyond the experience of most 9 to 5 wage slaves.<br /> Read this book, and you'll understand why there's nothing smart women can't accomplish.  It's not a whine and moan session about women's rights or affirmative action;  it's simply a superb account about how a talented and dedicated person can find success in anything they set out to do, based on talent, energy and dedication.<br /> &quot;Alden once told me that his father, also a fisherman, told him that anyone who chooses to make fishing his occupation solely for the money is in the wrong business.  If no thrill is experienced in catching fish, no satisfaction in going to sea and returning to shore, no pride in exclaiming 'I am a fisherman,' then a life on the water will be unfulfilling, perhaps even unbearable,&quot; Greenlaw writes.  Her book is a wonderful story of why this is true.<br /> It's true for any job.  If you don't like your work, then half or more of your life is misery.  Greenlaw vividly explains why long-line fishermen will work 20-hour days for two or more weeks, spending a month at sea for every two days in port.  It's insanity, pure and simple and wonderful; by the end of this book, every reader will wish they shared some of the same madness.<br /> She's a superb writer.  This isn't simply about catching some fish;  she writes about fishing with the same articulate skill as Patrick O'Brian does in his masterful stories of life under sail in the Napoleonic era.  Greenlaw writes with humor, heartbreak and heroics;  she even manages, in describing a month at sea when many other boats were catching few fish, to instill a palpable sense of suspense as to whether or not she and her crew will have a &quot;slammer&quot; of a trip or come home with nothing to show for a month's risk, work, pain and hardship.<br /> She's tough.  As she admits, &quot;Making unpopular decisions is part of being the captain.&quot;  It's a habit modern managers should learn, instead of indulging their childish desires to be pals instead of professional.  Greenlaw could handle any executive position in business, because she places more importance on integrity which generates personal and professional respect instead of feel-good excuses, slipshod results and indifferent quality.<br /> She's also kind and considerate, with a wonderful sense of humour.  It's a superb book, some of the best writing I've read in years.  Every reader will share the delight of people who love their work, and are good at it, plus an author who presents a fascinating accountg of what is otherwise an almost invisible career.<br /> Buy it.  Read it.  Perhaps, if there is any sense of quality left in Hollywood, someone will realize it has the content, quality and story line to make a superb film.  After all, one of O'Brian's books is due out as a movie in late 2003, and the film of 'The Perfect Storm' about the loss of the Andrea Gail was released some time ago.<br /> Greenlaw weathered the same storm as the Andrea Gail, some 400 miles distant, then helped search for survivors.  Her story is more impressive because she is real, she succeeds and she understands the pride that leads men to face such risks.<br /> Buy it.

They are hurt, bewildered, confused and made mad by change.  Arizons is flooded with refugees from California who want to go back to &quot;the good old days&quot;  --  they have utterly restored Prescott into a brand new Victorian town of the 1890s, and they are now restoring the glory of the 1920s and 1930s in central Phoenix.<br /> Like many of the elderly in mind, spirit and outlook, Didion regrets what is past.  She doesn't seem to understand that even if the future is different, it may be better.  It's a story of her family intertwined with modern California;  both her ancestors and California are examples of people constantly on the move in the search for something better  --  even if they don't know what that &quot;something&quot; might be, and even if they lose their heritage by moving.<br /> Granted, Didion is the &quot;intellectual&quot; of the family.  This book gave me the distinct impression she'd be much happier, fulfilled and content if her ancestors had never left Alsace.  Somehow I doubt if she speaks German  --  she wouldn't go back to Alsace unless she spoke German, just to show the Frenchies that her past is more important than their conquests.  So she did the next best thing, and now lives in New York.<br /> As a genuine New Yorker, which is not &quot;her&quot; city so she doesn't mind how it changes, she offers a long recital of California happenings as seen by an original family and finds the state much lacking since her departure.  Any one of us, and I'm no exception, can return to our &quot;hometown&quot; and find similar faults.<br /> It's a nice book for tired old people waiting out their empty years in sterile nursing homes where they lament the passing of the past.  Even homebound grouches may find it interesting, especially if they live in California.<br /> There are flashes of insight, such as her descriptions of the Alameda Corridor, and the Lakewood school sex scandal;  but, she fails to draw any meaning from these events.  Her descriptions of the aircraft industry are interesting  --  and exactly the same as I heard in the 1960s when I worked in the aircraft industry.  Ho hum, it's a pity she never helped put airplanes together.<br /> Perhaps it's because she doesn't understand herself, or her ancestors.  She is the epitome of the quintessential Californian, the daughter of a long line of &quot;California&quot; ancestors even when they lived on the Virginia/Carolina frontier in 1766.  As a Canadian, I'd describe her as everything we expect Californians to represent;  as a Californian, she is blind to personal introspection as well as understanding herself and her state.<br /> If you like moaning about the past, you'll love this book.  Didion finds a lot to regret, and not much of the modern to understand, an approach which many find attractive.  If you can read through her words, uncover the meanings hidden in her chronicle of complaint, you'll discover the basics which made California a great state.re are flashes of insight, such as her descriptions of the Alameda Corridor, and the Lakewood school sex scandal;  but, she fails to draw any meaning from these events.

Another surprise for him is that journalists, even when the lies are obvious, obsequiously accept them as profound truths.<br /> It's how the world works outside the ivory tower.  Life is a series of lies, to ourselves and to others;  success consists of seeing through these lies without unduly embarrassing others.  Anyone who believes everything the politicians tell them is also likely to believe used car salesmen and the developers who sell Arizona desert land.<br /> For Krugman, it's an eye-opening experience to discover the Bush administration has been, is and will continue to lie to the American people.  What is far more interesting, and which makes this book a gem, is that Krugman offers an original and frightening reason for these lies.  First of all, you need to think of the US government --  which spends 90 percent of its revenues on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the military  --  on the same basis as an intelligent economist (Krugman).<br /> On that basis, the US government is a big insurance company which also has an army.<br /> Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare are insurance programs.  The Bush administration wants to turn these insurance programs over to private insurance companies and leave the government only in the military business, plus housekeeping duties (national parks, federal lands, business regulation and the like).  This is a genuine revolution, a total rejection of America as it now exists and a rejection of almost every social measure enacted since President Herbert Hoover.  It is a bold leap forward into a survival-of-the-fittest future --  based on a philosophy in which Pharisees (rich Americans) are praised for passing by the travelers wounded by our society.<br /> His analysis of the Bush administration is the great strength of this book.  Most journalists think of politicians as saints or sinners;  Krugman is astute enough to look beyond the lies to discern the real agenda.  In the main, the book is a collection of columns from the past four or so years detailing the utter folly of thinking about Bush in terms of politics as usual.  Instead, he argues convincingly that Bush is waging a true revolution in American social policies.<br /> If you read it with a simple mind, on the basis of liking Bush or disliking Bush, you will either learn nothing new or will think Krugman is a liar.<br /> If you accept his premise that Bush is waging a genuine economic revolution, creating deliberate events such as far distant wars to distract the public, then whether you love or hate Bush you'll be fascinated by the insights this book offers.<br /> Bush may be a liar, but he's not stupid.  Bush may be the best tonic for America since President Theodore Roosevelt, but that doesn't make him trustworthy.  In either case, Krugman deftly pulls back the layers of deception (call it a smokescreen if you're a Bush fan) to illustrate a very dynamic revolution in America.<br />  This is a tremendous book.  It's a tale of terror for those who hate Bush;  it's a triumph for those who think the government should get out of the insurance business.his book.

Well, 200 years ago almost every Christian on the planet believed that to be a fact with the same assurance they had in their belief in Jesus Christ and the rest of Christian theology.  The precise date and time had been announced in 1650 with the publication of &quot;Annals of the Oled Testament&quot; by James Ussher, archbishop of Armaugh, Ireland.  For generations, every copy of the King James edition of the Bible included Bishop Ussher's dates in the margins.<br /> Educated people now believe the world was created about 4.6 billion years ago, and the universe is about 15 billion years old.  Those figures are based on exacting scientific analysis, which anyone with access to a space shuttle, nuclear laboratory or radio telescope can verify.  Bishop Ussher, not having access to such scientific equipment, based his Oct. 23, 4004 BC date for the creation of the Earth on the Christian bible.<br /> So, in 1788 and without access to modern scientific equipment, how did James Hutton challenge the accepted reasoning of the entire scientific and religious establishment to prove the world is billions of years old?<br />This book is a first-rate account of how it happened.<br /> Hutton, by literally inventing the modern science of geology, became one of the handful of men who created the modern world.  He lived in Edinburgh at the same time as David Hume, Adam Smith, Erasmus Darwin and the other leading figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.  Together, this handful of brilliant men, working and thinking in a community that valued education and new ideas, launched a revolution in scientific thought that continues to this day.  One scientist outside the Edinburgh group who communicated regularly with them was Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman, polymath and genius who discovered electricity and a wealth of otrher now common natural phenomena.  Adam Smith, another one of the group, literally invented the economic foundation of modern society.<br /> In 1788, while the US Constitution was in the process of ratification, Hutton published his 95-page document in which he explained the world was created long before Oct. 23, 4004 BC.  He based his work on rigid science, not on tradition or religious orthodoxy.  It was a bold leap into the future.<br /> He was a major player in what became an extraordinary breakthrough in scientific reasoning, just as the US Constitution was a breakthrough in the manner by which people govern themselves.  All were based on the same principle, the first-hand observation of events rather than relying on ancient theories or religious dogma.  These were men who believed in the future, not in being bound by the unchanging chains of the past.<br /> Repchck does a masterful job of tying these elements together, not merely Hutton and his observations and work, but the intellectual habits and social habits of the era.  He explains how and why Edinburgh became the intellectual capital of the world for at least two generations, during the time Hutton developed his ideas.<br /> When you think of how completely our whole way of thinking has changed in less than 200 years, the impact of a handful of scientists such as Hutton may well be the greatest intellectual advancement of mankind since the days of the Greek philosophers.<br /> To sum up, this is a wonderful book.  Hutton was the ideal of the perfect scientist, and Repcheck not only understands the man but the social climate in which he developed his ideas.<br />Biographies usually talk only of the person, histories only of events;  this book outlines with eloquent clarity how a variety of seemingly unrelated events came together in one place at one time in the mind of one man to utterly change our world.<br />Today, we should be so fortunate!wealth of otrher now common natural phenomena.

Everything involves choices and compromises.  Even when an engineer built &quot;the one hoss shay&quot; with such perfection that no single part would fail first, one flaw remained  --  when it wore out, the whole thing collapsed instantly and completely.<br /> At first, this book annoyed me.  His first example of the epitome of design is the little plastic tripod that keeps the lid of a pizza box from being crushed onto the gooey surface of the hot pizza inside.  There isn't even a name for that little tripod;  failing anything else, you'd think someone would name it &quot;Sam&quot; in honor of holding up the roof.  Samson, after all, was strong, useful and not quite perfect.<br /> Yet, such is the genius of this book.  He could have written about the design flaws that have caused two Space Shuttle disasters;  instead, he takes everyday items we are completely familiar with and explains why these designs are less than perfect.<br /> When an author can devote half-a-chapter to the design challenges of cup holders in a 1996 Volvo and make it interesting, you know he's onto something.  Understanding why a cup holder in a car falls short of a perfect design, and why chairs, lightbulbs, door knobs, potato peelers, toothbrushes, paper bags and duct tape are still works in progress, gives you an appreciation for the design flaws in a Space Shuttle and in the human organization which launches Shuttles or even those which run the &quot;intelligence&quot; agencies.  Only TV sitcoms and dramas offer &quot;perfect&quot; solutions  --  which, in itself, is the major flaw of television.<br /> Newspapers are sometimes called &quot;a journal to expose the faults of the world and the typogarphical errors of its staff.&quot;  The humour is barbed, but true.  Petroski takes that idea a major leap forward, showing us in everyday terms why everything human's design is less than perfect.  On that basis, he asks for an acceptance of the inevitable flaws of technology.<br /> On the same basis, this book will give any thoughtful reader an appreciation of why everything is somewhat less than perfect, and thus all people should be ready to accept the inevitable flaws of others.s are sometimes called &quot;a journal to expose the faults of the world and the typogarphical errors of its staff.&quot;  The humour is barbed, but true.

Trust me.<br />  It exists. It is dedicated to destroying the America we know, and replacing it<br />  with a command-and-control morality to be<br />  imposed on all by the religious leaders such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson<br />  and Tammy Faye Baker.<br />  How do I know? Go to any supermarket and look at the National Inquirer<br />  or News of the World. There's a massive audience<br />  for wacky ideas and silly publications; in every society, at least 10 percent of<br />  the population are chronic kickers and<br />  conspiracy freaks. That 10 percent of the population is about 15 times the<br />  size of The Wall Street Journal circulation, one of<br />  the prime right wing publications, so it's hardly surprising there's a massive<br />  audience waiting to be fed at the trough of the<br />  right-wing propaganda machine..<br />  Although the Journal is a profit-making operation, based on its superb and<br />  often penetrating business news coverage, the<br />  survival of most of the right-wing zealots cited by Conason requires massive<br />  subsidies from very wealthy patrons. The New<br />  York Times is supported by its readers and advertisers, based on the merit<br />  and truth of its news coverage; the conservative<br />  Washington Times is supported by the Moonie Church, because it cannot<br />  otherwise attract enough advertisers or readers.<br />  The same is true for many of the publications which make up the right-wing<br />  propaganda machine. The American people, even<br />  that 10 percent radical right fringe which reads and listens to the<br />  conservative zealots cited in this book, do not financially<br />  support such extremist smear tactics. It is why a few of the mega-rich, from<br />  the Buckleys to Scaife and the Moonie Church,<br />  use their inherited wealth to subsidize the conservative media.<br />  Conason does a superb jop of compiling the egregious beliefs of the<br />  conservative media, but he fails to assess the impact of this<br />  propaganda blitz. Except for the 10 percent of chronic kickers, about the<br />  usual fringe ratio in every society, most Americans<br />  don't believe such blatant nonsense. Look at the front page of the National<br />  Inquirer, ask yourself how many people believe its<br />  stories, and remember it is a very profitable publication.<br />  If the Inquirer can make money, then why does the conservative media need<br />  consistent subsidies from the ultra-wealthy who<br />  were too lazy to earn their own wealth, too inept to conserve it, and too<br />  terrified of losing it to think rationally. No one frets<br />  about the social or political impact of Inquirer readers, perhaps their<br />  conspirators-in-fantasy in the right-wing media are equally<br />  impotent. Perhaps that issue deserves a book of its own.<br />  Consider this: Some people will believe anything a Hollywood star says,<br />  simply because that person is a star. Those people<br />  are called fans. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a current example; Ronald<br />  Reagan was a successful predecessor. Others will<br />  believe anything the filthy rich have to say, simply because that person is<br />  filthy rich. Those people are the servant class. They<br />  are the foundation of right-wing politics.<br />  Until then, this book is a must-read for the 90 percent of rational Americans<br />  who think Rush Limbaugh and his copycats are<br />  very talented bunco artists who've found a new way to amuse the crowd of<br />  gullible dupes who believe in Elvis, flying saucers,<br />  televangelists and the suspicion that our whole society is a massive<br />  conspiracy.<br />  As P. T. Barnum once said, \\"there's a sucker born every minute.\\" Conason<br />  deftly pulls back the curtain on just what those<br />  suckers will believe.were too lazy to earn their own wealth, too inept to conserve it, and too<BR>                                     terrified of losing it to think rationally.

When you treat those who differ from you with insult and contempt, instead of listening and debate, it's hardly surprising they are not your biggest fans when you need help.  In late September, President George Bush went hat-in-hand to the United Nations begging for aid to help rebuild the facilities destroyed by American and British bombs in Iraq.  Not surprisingly, having advised Bush not to destroy Iraq in the first place, UN members had little respect and support for Bush's plea for help.<br /> It's an incredible story.  On the day after Sept. 11, 2001, the French newspaper 'Le Monde' declared in its main headline &quot;We are all Americans.&quot;  It was a widely shared attitude not only in France, but in Canada, Mexico and most of the world.  Newhouse shows how it took the zealots of the Bush administration, and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in particular, less than two years to generate anti-American feelings through most of the world.<br /> The blunt reality is that America needs friends, supporters and allies.  To cite one example:  the Bush administration has turned the Clinton budget surplus into the most massive federal deficits in history, now growing by about $ 1.5 billion per day. As the war on Iraq showed, about 75 percent of the money to finance the deficit comes from overseas.  If you think foreign opinion doesn't matter, try running the country without the foreign &quot;opinion&quot; that now pours into the United States treasury.<br /> In incident after incident, detail after detail, Newhouse shows how the insensitivity and crassness of Rumseld and a few other Bush zealots is leading the United States to a new and absolute isolationism.  Iran is one example, a country facing as much danger from Arab fundamentalism as any nation and eager, after 9/11, to join the United States in rooting out the terrorists on its soil.<br /> Instead of cooperation, of which Iran had much to offer of great benefit to the US, Bush labeled Iran as part of the &quot;axis of evil.&quot;  It was a great sound bite for Bush's State of the Union speech, it got a lot of attention, and it utterly destroyed any chance of Iran providing major intelligence to the US to combat terrorism.<br /> Pakistan, in contrast, which actively supports the Taliban and al Qaeda, is still one of Bush's allies.  It makes one wonder whose side Bush is on.<br /> There's little new or surprising in this book for anyone who's followed the news for the past couple of years.  Instead, Newhouse does a masterful job of making sense of the radical transformation of American foreign policy that is now underway.  It's a wonderful compilation for the isolationists, who want to see America as aloof from the world as Cuba and North Korea.  Sadly, these isolationists are not impressed enough by history to know what happened because of American isolationism after World War I and after World War II until the Marshall Plan took effect.  They will love the successes outlined in this book.<br /> For anyone who is impressed by history, it shows how Americans are sleepwalking into a history filled with terror, disaster and decline.es to a new and absolute isolationism.

Sadly, he doesn't seem to appreciate the desert or forests in the same manner as writers such as Joseph Wood Krutch or even Zane Grey.  He doesn't appreciate that we live in a messy modern world, with only a few gems of wilderness left.<br /> For example:  Townsend cites efforts in the 1960s to dam the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon itself, and the noble efforts to stop it.  Excellent.  He ignores the alternative that was built with the connivance of the people who stopped the dam  --  one of the largest coal-fired power plants in the nation which spews its pollution over tens of thousands of square miles of the Southwest.  He also thinks Lake Powell should be drained.  Maybe it's time to tear down the Forth Bridge as &quot;unnatural.&quot;<br /> His arrogant rants are the equivalent of a Yankee tourist recommending Hadrian's Wall be torn down to restore the natural landscape.  Of course, much of it HAS been torn down  --  a look at any farmer's barns within a few miles of the wall shows how those Roman building stones were re-used.  Anyone who's hiked off a trail knows there's no &quot;untouched&quot; landscape left.  And, if you're going to stick to the trail  --  this book is about hiking The Arizona Trail  --  then you're in man-made country.<br /> Like all too many wilderness advocates, Townsend fails to appreciate the natural world for what now exists.  It's like building a replica of a wooden ship;  no matter how authentic you make it, it isn't the original.  In some cases, it's better than the original.  Likewise, the Arizona of today is not the Arizona of a century ago, nor five centuries ago.  In some ways, it's better.<br /> Britain is filled with almost 60 million people like Townsend;  all whinges, moans and complaints but never the initiative to do anything.  Anyone with energy and ambition emigrates, which is why Australia is such a dynamic place.  Those who stay home find fault with everything, and particularly with anyone who had the energy to leave.<br /> In brief, the book is the first of its kind so it's the finest yet available.  Anyone who plans to do any extensive hiking in Arizona should read it.  It contains enough Arizona details to be valuable, enough hiking information to be useful, enough rants to please the beads and Birkenstocks crowd,  but far from enough cactus hugging to satisfy a desert rat.<br /> But then, how many readers are likely to be desert rats?  Buy it, it's more interesting than those which haven't been published.  It's not the type of book to take on a desert hike, but it's a good read before such a walk.  Someday, an even better book may be written about The Arizona Trail, but if you plan on waiting that long the trail may be paved by then.made country.<br /> Like all too many wilderness advocates, Townsend fails to appreciate the natural world for what now exists.

US	49694975	RJE77UXLSE9MV	0060582618	708864428	Thirty Days: Tony Blair and the Test of History	Books	5	1	31	N	N	There's always be an excuse in England	There will always be an England, according to the refrain of the song I learned in the first grade of school;  it's just that we never dreamed Britain would one day be a poodle trembling under the wings of the American eagle.<br /> Tony Blair, as this book abundantly makes clear, is England's \\"Cleopatra\\" to the mighty George \\"Caesar\\" Bush.  When you think of how Caesar used Cleopatra, for his own personal pleasure and the benefit of Rome, you get an idea of how this book portrays Blair.<br /> It is an incisive book in many ways, and because of that it is also very sad.  The goal seems to be one of fawning obsequiousness to Blair's decision to support Bush's war on Iraq.  Sadly, little details seep through to thoroughly undermine the decisive image sought by Blair.<br /> Stothard writes of Blair's visit to Camp David, \\"The hosts' first view of their British guests is of the cleverest men in Whitehall, without a raincoat between them, muttering nervous words about having 'only one suit' while rain lashes in horizontal lines over the tarmac.\\"  Geeeee.  These Brits, who think they can advise and guide an American oil-patch president, didn't think to phone ahead and ask about the weather?<br /> Okay, another example.  Near the end of the war, President Bush flew to \\"Merry Old Ireland\\" to meet Blair at Hillsborough Castle, just outside Belfast.  Once again, Stothard is at his unwitting best, \\"The Prime Minister is not having his normal cooked breakfast;  there's just bananas, melon, croissants, because that's what the Americans want.\\"  Geeeee.  Even McDonalds is sometimes able to come up with a more varied menu.<br /> Who runs Britain?  Not Blair, that's for sure.  Stothard writes of a Scots Member of Parliament who \\"has several thousand Catholic constituents who put the Pope's views before their Prime Minister.\\"  Blair's Foreign Secretary has problems of his own because, \\"Muslim voters are well represented in Blackburn, Lancashire.  They dislike the idea of their elected representative helping the American takeover of a Muslim country.\\"<br /> Very early, he mentions plans to curb anti-social behaviour in Britain by \\"schemes to punish graffiti-writers and car-burners.\\"  Graffiti is a problem?  It can be solved very simply, quickly, easily and cheaply by having a few blokes with paint sprayers who simply paint out any graffiti within 24-hours of it being reported.  It works.<br /> The whole book is written in this manner, expressing the idea \\"wouldn't life be nice if only somebody would do something.\\"  In describing a speech that was pivotal to Blair's political survival, Stothard writes, \\"He has written most of them alone, in longhand in blue ink, high in the small sitting room of the flat . . . .\\"  Geeeeee.  Doesn't Blair have any speechwriters or aides to whom he can think out loud and get back several written draughts of a speech?  It's little wonder Britain is so leaderless.  If you can't organize a staff to put together a speech, how can you get trains to run on time or clean up graffiti?  Perhaps, as Cleopatra realized one night while lying flat on her back, it's time to accept a pro-consul as the real ruler of the country.<br /> Cleopatra had the guts to fight back.  Her mistake was seducing Marc Antony, the wrong Caesar in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Instead of independent thinking, Stothard tells of a brilliant, principled, idealistic prime minister surrounded by fawning toadies who are afraid to visit the \\"Gent's\\" without prior permission from Tony.<br /> It's not that Stothard is unobservant.  He sparkles in descriptions of the visit to Camp David.  He contrasts the flock of puppies bouncing along after the Blair Poodle to American presidential aides who are as independent as a bunch of posse riders gathering at the campfire after having strung up a few rustlers.<br /> The great weakness of this book is it's lack of revealing detail.  He never came up with a typical daily schedule for Blair, and he omitted the full text of Blair's \\"pivotal\\" speech to the House of Commons.  Readers deserve to have that text, and possibly texts of some of the other crucial statements or debates.<br /> Ignoring the text of Blair's significant speeches is like writing a history of World War II and ignoring the speeches of Churchill, Hitler and Roosevelt.  Perhaps, though, that is Stothard's final message  --  Blair is far from being a Churchill, or even a Thatcher.<br /> Nonetheless, it's a fascinating look at Blair.  Stothard cites President Clinton and \\"the absurdities of the Monica Lewinsky affair\\" for not taking greater military action.  Maybe, in five or ten years time, Brits will look at the turmoil and terror in the Middle East and ask plaintively, \\"Why can't we find our own Monica Lewinsky when we need her the most?\\"<br /> On the other hand, if the \\"Mother of All Wars\\" which toppled Saddam Hussein proved to be the catalyst that set the Muslim world onto the path of a docile, Allah-fearing, oil-pumping and trouble-free region and thank Blair as the \\"God-Father of all Peace.\\"<br />Which do you think is more likely?the full text of Blair's \\"pivotal\\" speech to the House of Commons.

People have rowed boats across the Atlantic before, let alone on inland waters in North America.  Stone things of eastern North America as an island, not as a great body interlaced with streams that are a living breathing pulse of half-a-continent.  In the Southwest, rivers are strangers;  the Zunis store their river just east of the pueblo at Blackrock Lake.  Spend a few nights at Ojo Caliente, and you appreciate the magic of water in a barren land.<br /> When it first opened, merely driving the Alaska Highway was an adventure worth a book.  Now that thousands drive it every year, it needs more than a listing of mileposts and towns along the way.  Canadian author Farley Mowatt showed what boats can be in 'The Boat Who Wouldn't Float.'  Gerry Spiess described the feelings of sailing a 10-foot long boat (Stone's boat is 17-feet, 9-inches long) single-handed across the Atlantic.<br /> Stone was a teacher in Zuni, New Mexico;  yet, from what he wrote, it's merely a place where he went to teach Native Americans.  It makes me wonder if he has ever walked outdoors during a still night and breathed in the incredible soft smokey scent of burning pinon and mesquite; or been the victim of the wonderful Zuni sense of practical jokes;  attended a Shalako or Zuni Tribal Fair;  or even talked to folks as they replaster their adobe buildings.  This account of his trip makes me wonder if he ever stopped to smell the flowers, or whether he was just interested in earning more miles.<br /> His writing is like that of many teachers, filled to the brim with very valuable knowledge which we really should learn ---  but empty of interpersonal relationships.  He offers no feel of New York, the damp gray cold of the water and air, especially at the time of year he left.  I couldn't find his descriptions of rowing a day, or days, in the rain.  It's as though this was an accomplishment to complete, more than an adventure to live.<br /> Granted, the classic American travel stories are by Mark Twain, John Steinbeck and Jack Kerouac.  In comparison, Stone merely covered miles.  His students probably do much of the same thing;  they get facts from him, and they give facts back to him at test-time.  Then, away from the teacher's gaze, they draw and paint their feelings instead of what they are taught  --  and turn out some of the finest original artwork in the Southwest.<br /> Perhaps times have just changed too much from the years when I canoed.  Near the end of the book, Stone offers a chilling observation, &quot;I've long since learned that the more expensive a boat, the less likely its captain is to wave.&quot;  Perhaps we are little too money-conscious, leaving adventurers such as Stone as orphans from a time long past.  If so, it would explain much of the hollowness of the book compared to times past.<br /> Stone's friendliest receptions came from professionals who make their living on the water;  his warmest experiences were in the Cajun country of Louisiana;  his coldest chills were on the Florida coast where multi-million dollar mansions are hollow fronts for empty hearts and closed minds.  Perhaps his discovery of America in a rowboat reflects a different land that the one of 50 years ago  --  a much diminished sense of purpose and place.<br /> In conclusion, it's a mildly interesting story of an incredible adventure.  Most people will be astonished to learn that such a voyage is possible;  Stone not only did it, but showed the experience can be entertaining as well.  It sure beats driving an SUV.left.

He married well, but lost his wife's dowry in two failed stores and finally neded up running a hot-dog and beer stand in a traveling circus.  He thought life must offer something better for him, his family and young daughter.  In 1905 he got $30 for steerage passage in 1905, then found out what America was all about.  He spoke only a few words of English, his work experience consisted of two failed businesses sponsored by his wealthy in-laws, and there were no jobs to be had.  He finally collapsed, near starvation, on the steps of St. Mark's Hospital in New York;  when he was revived, instead of welfare, he was given a mob and pail.  It was his first job in America, with the title of \\"porter.\\"<br /> This introduction made his commitment to America complete.  He never became rich.  But he never felt any desire to return to Serbia.  The feature he loved about this country was that Americans placed more value on ability than on birth.  As one immigrant said, \\"My cap is not worn out from raising it in the presence of gentlemen.\\"  His first job in America with a mop and pail would have been untjinkable even for a failed businessman in Europe;  in America, he realized \\"Honest labour is no disgrace.\\"<br /> It reflects the American Dream.  Jastrow writes, \\"It has always been so in the history of life.  When adverse forces press upon a population and survival becomes increasingly difficult, only the venturesome few seek their opportunities in a new environment.\\"  Her husband found his success in America was measured by freedom;  their son, Robert Jastrow, became one of America's premiere astrophysicists.<br /> But, and perhaps I should say BUT, there are vast differences between then and now.  In that era, as Jastrow writes, \\"If, by chance, a mother met her child's teacher on the street she would become settled, and wipe her hand on her apron before extending it.  Often she would dip into a kind of slight curtsey and consider the meeting the most momentous even in her life.\\"  In my experience, much of this attitude lasted into the 1950s.<br /> Now, think of recent years when conservatives such as Bill Bennett have viciously and persistently denounced teachers as immoral, unfit, uneducated, unpatriotic, and every other sin not currently in use.  Arizona's largest newspaper denounced and ridiculed teachers for generations, simply because they were government employees.  The respect of Jastrow's era has turned into modern contempt, with the result that a once expanding and progressive educational system has been turned into a profession of shame.<br /> The obvious question, for any intelligent person reading this book, is whether this change from obedient deference for teachers and politicians to the modern open contempt will produce a similar intellectual curiosity and achievement.  Certainly, 15-year-old Hungarian refugee Andy Grove has done well since coming to America, including the founding of Intel as one of his achievements;  likewise, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak did rather well in the 1970s in created Apple Computer;  and, in the 1990s, Jeff Bezos with Amazon and Bill Gates with Microsft have proven to be rather inventive and successful.<br /> It's the fun of this book.  Jastrow describes the often harrowing conditions which became the welcoming experience for millions of people.  It's the sort of orderly structured predictable world so longed for by conservatives.  Yet, America has continued to do rather well.  It could be that sustained raps on the knuckles, or intense multi-cultural sensitrivity, are not the keys to the success of America.  Instead, it may be something far simpler  --  the eternal Amerifcan optimism to give anyone a chance to succeed.  In the \\"Acknowledgments\\" at the end of the book, she expresses \\"a very special debt to W. W. Norton for launching my career as a writer at the age of eighty-two.\\"<br /> How very American.<br /> This is a land of perpetual opportunity.  It's a wonderful and beautifully accurate portrait of times long past.  Her father walked to work when the weather was good, because that saved the 5-cents carfare and her mother would say, \\"I can buy a bread and have one cent left over.\\"  One cent bought half a pint of milk, an egg, a roll.  Even 30 years later, in Canada, my parents never bought sliced bread  --  unsliced bread was one cent cheaper.<br /> Like any good love affair, Jastrow doesn't analyze the subconscious meanings of her father's falling in love with America.  She caught his optimism that America meant life would be better for them, and in this book she simply but eloquently shares the excitement and wonder of it all without judgment or criticism.  The book is a gem.presses \\"a very special debt to W. W.

Ever look through a kaleidoscope?<br />A kaleidoscope offers an ever-changing pattern of bright colors. Some patterns are weird, some beautiful. Think of watching one for an hour, with that hour symbolizing the 4.5 billion year history of our earth. On this kaleidoscope-clock, the dinosaurs<br />vanished 50 seconds ago; and intelligent human life -- homo sapiens, which began about 100,000 years ago -- is a one-tenth<br />of a second click of that kaleidoscopic clock.<br />On this basis, all 5,000 years of human history is a one two-hundred-and-fiftieth second of this kaleidoscope of time. That's less than the shutter click of most cameras. In comparison, dinosaurs lived for about one minute, 40 seconds. Hopefully, this sets the age of the earth in perspective.<br />Despite global warming, which may stall the inevitable, Ward and Brownlee suggest the normal conditions for the past and next 2.5 million years is what we call the Ice Ages. They contend the return of the Ice Age \\"will effectively end the world as we<br />know it -- and potentially end human civilization as well.\\"<br />Interesting, if true.<br />They paint a grim picture of the future within the next few thousand years. They have gathered a mass of sophisticated data to support their premise, and come up with \\"phlogiston\\" theory of the fate of the Earth. For those who don't remember, when<br />phlogiston was added to an ore it produced a metal, and when taken away the result was an oxide. It was a nice simple way<br />to explain dozens of puzzles. Before that, of course, fire contained a mysterious property which passed through solid materials to change the properties of a metal.<br />My point is not that Ward and Brownlee are wrong. They offer a fascinating view of a fascinating, they would say grim, future<br />within a few thousand years. My point is that humans have an increasing capacity for intelligence, and during the next few<br />thousand years our science of today will come to be seen as outdated as the phlogiston of 250 years ago.<br />It's what makes their book so fascinating, and relevant. Let's assume everything they write about comes true. The challenge<br />then is how do we live in dramatically different conditions. They offer the elements of a fascinating mystery, which is an<br />intriguing look into the potential future of the Earth; like any good who-done-it, readers are left to devise their own scenario for how people of the future will cope.<br />Much of the book seems predicated on the \\"chaos\\" theory, in which a butterfly flaps its wings in Rio de Janeiro and sets air<br />currents in motion which eventually build up into a hurricane which devastates the coast of Florida. Okay. That happens. But<br />there are millions of butterflies in Brazil, and we don't get millions of hurricanes every year. There are literally a million other scenarios, and I suspect Ward and Brownlee offer the worst-case one.<br />Well, as anyone who lives in Florida knows, you can't rule out hurricanes. But, intelligent construction and other measures can<br />vastly reduce the real damage of a hurricane. Or you can choose to live elsewhere. That is the value of intelligence. Granted,<br />future humans may choose to do as modern Floridians and take a chance the hurricanes will pass by elsewhere.<br />Intelligence is difficult to assess. President John F. Kennedy committed the United States to spending $100 billion (in today's<br />dollars) on the Apollo Moon program. President George Bush is spending as much or more on the invasion and occupation of<br />Iraq. The debate has barely begun on which is more beneficial to America.<br />Even at that, today's \\"least intelligent solution\\" is immensely more intelligent than answers of a thousand years ago. In general, people have gotten pretty smart during the past few thousand years.<br />This book is a fascinating tour-de-force of the potential disasters facing life in our spot in the universe. Given enough time, the disaster scenarios will eventually come true. It reminds me of the cartoon of the physicist, standing in front of a mass of blackboards filled with abstruse equations and one final notation \\"Then a miracle occurs\\" which resolves it all.<br />Well, to me, the intelligence of life today is pretty much of a miracle. What if the first prokaryotes, the very first bacterial life on Earth some some 3.8 billion years ago, had read this book and decided that life and intelligence was a dead-end. Fortunately<br />they didn't, and so Ward and Brownlee and all the rest of us are here today and we've made our Earth into a pretty interesting<br />place.<br />Should we quit now? Will the next 3.8 billion years be any duller?

There is no end of books stressing customer service.  This book says it's how you think of customer service that makes the difference  --  if you want to sell lemonade, let customers add your own sugar, offer lemon slices to those who want a tarter drink, keep the noise down so you don't bother the neighbors, don't block the street, plus other common sense approaches.<br /> Let me cite a personal example.  Recently, in addition to a Big Mac, I wanted a McDonald's ice cream cone.  The counter person asked what flavor, and I replied that any flavor would be fine.  My response didn't fit the McDonald's program.  Instead of picking a flavor, the counter person became very loud and very rude in insisting that I name a flavor.  Finally, a mananger intervened and I was handed a chocolate ice cream cone  --  which was perfect, though I didn't know ahead of time what flavor I wanted.<br /> The McDonalds' clerk was too intent on following a pre-set McDonalds script.  The point Mitchell and Coles stress is listening to the customer and responding, as much as is feasible within your resources, to whatever the customer wants.<br /> Sounds simple, right?  Sadly, all too many companies  --  from hamburger stands to multi-national corporations, have rigid &quot;customer satisfaction&quot; rules that are marvelous creations of corporate ingenuity but sometimes have little to do with customer satisfaction.<br /> If you can think of what customers want in terms of a kids' lemonade stand, then you're on the way to knowing how to satisfy customer wants in any business.  Simple?  Okay, why hasn't he multi-national McDonalds hasn't figured it out?  When I said &quot;any flavor,&quot; the response should have been, &quot;Here, we hope you enjoy this flavor.&quot;  Instead, I got an argument.<br /> Most business advice books offer theories, or case studies.  This book takes a different approach, asking again and again, &quot;What would you do?  How would you feel?  What would you like?&quot;  It explains how a variety of companies satisfy these interests.<br /> In the book 'The Art of Advertising,' George Lois states, &quot;The business world worships mediocrity.  Officially we revere free enterprise, initiative and individuality.  Unofficially we fear it.&quot;  In contrast, Mitchell and Coles fear conformity and lack of imagination;  they welcome and praise the originality of ordinary customers.<br /> Okay, who is a typical customer?  Unless you're the pilot of a rent-a-jet, most customers are average people  --  not corporate executives.  When you read this book's story of &quot;Mike the barber&quot; at Harvard University you get a full appreciation of an ordinary man who became one of the school's most distinguished alumni  --  despite never having taken a class or ever working for the university.<br /> When I read the jacket blurbs praising this book, I was disappointed.  They all talked of &quot;business model innovation&quot; and &quot;business planning&quot; and &quot;business basics&quot; and other such jargon.  In my experience, every book offers such advice.  What makes this one different and valuable is its focus on ordinary customers and how understanding them relates to success.<br /> Granted, Harvard Business Review is a wonderful journal.  It speaks eloquently of business plans and corporate strategies and executive insights.  It is a masterful offering of even the most arcane and exotic business theories.<br /> &quot;The Ultimate Competitive Advantage&quot; is better.  It talks about the real people who make real businesses work.  It emphasizes how you think is more effective than merely knowing what to think about textbook formulas.titive Advantage&quot; is better.

They expected him to cite Stalingrad, instead he said, &quot;The Battle of Britain.&quot;<br />  Had the Germans won the Battle of Britain, England could not have won the Battle of the North Atlantic and may well have been forced to accept peace terms similar to France. According to former War Minister Hore-Belisha, &quot;the Tory party in the House were not very interested in the war, were afraid for their possessions and of the rise of Labour . . . . . &quot; The Russians may well have defeated Germany, but that would have left all of Europe under Soviet control, not merely the eastern half of Europe as eventually happened.<br />  The English myth of the Battle of Britain is similar to stories about Sir Francis Drake and the Spanish Armada in 1588, when Drake preferred to finish a game of bowls before sailing out to rout the Spanish. In 1940, the myth created by Churchill is that &quot;Never before has so much been owed by so many to so few.&quot; Like Dunkirk, the image was one of luck, pluck and mucking through the confusion, ineptness and amateurism.  Bungay shows the triumph of British planning and readiness.<br />  The German image, reinforced by quick and easy defeats of Poland and France, was that of an impregnable military machine guided by highly experienced professionals using superior technology with the rigorous discipline of well trained and effective troops. In contrast, the British were thought to be slightly dowdy country squires lucky enough to deny victory to the superb German military. Much of this legacy is based on the image of the Munich Agreement of 1938, which has ever since been used to describe English politicians as too weak to fight and too scared to rearm.<br />  Reality is quite different.  Bungay explains the British victory was based on a superb plan of operations and aircraft development that began in earnest in 1936 and was rigorously carried out in 1940. The basic idea was developed in 1922. Instead of being unprepared and underarmed, Britain was perhaps the world's best prepared and best armed nation in terms of air defense in the 1940s. The result was a decisive British victory which left the Luftwaffe crippled.<br />  To summarize, the British fought the Battle of Britain with a Teutonic thoroughness for organization, planning, discipline and effort; they left little to chance, planned for the worst cases and didn't rely on luck. In short, the British behaved like Germans at their best, though these qualities were tempered and restrained by the civility of traditional English life. The Germans fought with a British thoroughness for bickering, personal petty disputes and trusting in an ability to muddle through;  it is hardly an accident that two of the top German commanders committed suicide as a result of the internal wrangling and bitterness within the Luftwaffe high command.<br />  In 1940, the British knew they needed a united effort if they were to win; the Germans didn't adopt a similar attitude until mid-1945, when they realized they would need a united effort if their country was to survive in the post-war period. The British, in 1945, having won through a magnificent team effort, changed governments and embarked on an &quot;I'm all right, Jack&quot; philosophy backed up by union strikes designed to win the maximum benefit for their members even at the price of national economic survival.<br />  Maybe the British should learn to boast . . . . .<br />  However, the irony today is that the epitome of English luxury, the Rolls Royce automobile -- once a product of the same company that in 1940 built engines for Spitfires -- is now powered by engines made by the same company that built engines for the Me-109s that failed so ingloriously in 1940.<br />  But, is that something to boast about?omobile -- once a product of the same company that in 1940 built engines for Spitfires -- is now powered by engines made by the same company that built engines for the Me-109s that failed so ingloriously in 1940.<br />        But, is that something to boast about?	2003-05-27

If you like a strong minded, intelligent and very capable woman who is fed up with the limits and pettifogging details of today's rule-bound society, then you'll love the growth and daring of Special FBI Agent Janet Louise Fletcher.<br /> Like all mystery stories, this book deals with the chaos of criminals who know no rules and who operate in a rule-dominated society that is increasingly restricted and victimized by &quot;the rights of criminals.&quot;  All mystery stories are based on the premise of a hero who solves a crime with logic and perseverance to restore the normal peaceful and orderly function of society.  This is no exception.<br /> Today, life is not so simple.  The question of guilt or innocence often takes second place to whether all of the accused's rights have been respected.  One very good defense attorney once told me he could get an acquittal for anyone &quot;because every prosecution involves thousands of separate and intricate procedures, and the police merely have to get one wrong for the accused to go free.&quot;  Anyone remember why O.J. Simpson was aquitted?<br /> It's what Fletcher faced as the book opens.  The book is about her solution, which was very practical if somewhat unorthodox.<br /> The underlying element of the book is even more interesting.  Some people have an innate desire to hurt the object of their love  --  whether it's a spouse, a job, or even a friend.  It's not a lack of caring, instead it's a cry to be able to say, &quot;You love me despite the horrible things I do to you and all the pain and misery I cause.&quot;  They need proof they are loved despite their betrayals and the pain they inflict;  in a curious way, it's very much an expression of caring.<br />Remember the saying &quot;It is sometimes easier to be forgiven than to get permission in the first place.&quot;  Think of Fletcher as operating on this principle.<br /> In other words, &quot;Even though I hurt you terribly, please forgive me.&quot;  For Fletcher, it covers her education, career and job.  She loves and believes in her work, yet she is bitterly frustrated in watching the judicial system throw away months of her best efforts to nab the most devious of criminals.  So, counting on forgiveness, she plunges into risky behaviour intended to force her superiors to take extra-special steps to let her know she's still appreciated.<br /> Sound complicated?  Okay, think of 'The Matrix&quot; films which are a magnificent screed against the dangers and excesses of modern technology.  Yet, these films are beautifully crafted using the most modern, complex and manipulative technology.  It's nothing new.  Metropolis, in the 1920s, took the same approach and became a film classic.  It is hardly surprising to use the techniques we fear to destroy the results we fear.<br /> Why?  Because The Matrix, like Metropolis, like 'Watch Me,' is built around an exceptionally fine story that will keep you up late reading  --  then keep you awake in bed wondering just how much of it is feasible and real.  Holt is a masterful story teller, and this is a good story that leads you into cheering for Fletcher and her unorthodox methods of achieving everything her years of training and work cannot accomplish.<br /> In general, older mysteries are based on a private detective solving a crime  --  an unsolved crime is a &quot;mystery&quot;  --  that the &quot;system&quot; couldn't unravel.  In today's world, the &quot;system&quot; is seen as part of the problem that prevents the just resolution crimes.  Remember the old adage, &quot;If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.&quot;  Think of all the problems we hear about every day in those terms  --  the book is Fletcher's journey to being part of the solution by promptly doing what the system is unable to neatly accomplish.<br /> It's a far cry from the old traditional mystery stories.  But, it's a welcome reflection of how today's world is very different;  to quote an old Biblical saying, &quot;New bottles for new wine.&quot;  Fletcher is very clearly &quot;a fine new wine.&quot;  You'll love the bouquet of this book.blical saying, &quot;New bottles for new wine.&quot;  Fletcher is very clearly &quot;a fine new wine.&quot;  You'll love the bouquet of this book.	2003-05-22
US	49694975	R2C89SHB3V94QQ	0300098480	185193262	The Degaev Affair: Terror and Treason in Tsarist Russia	Books	5	17	21	N	Y	A look into the mind of a terrorist (and model citizen)	Although this book is offered as a portrait of a young Russian terrorist who eventually became a beloved professor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, it is also an invaluable look into the minds of terrorists.<br /> Russia, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, consisted of a newly educated commercial and industrial class that was rising in wealth and power  --  perhaps 10 percent of the population.  The other 90 percent were peasants, totally dedicated to the monarchy with an absolute trust the Czar would solve all of their problems.<br /> The self-made newly rich, frustrated by the status quo, wanted revolutionary change that would make everyone rich.  Sergei Degaev, the son of a doctor, was frustrated by the lack of social progress in Russia.  Pipes explains, \\"When life offers little so that the results of ideological work are not yet evident, the activist wants to see some concrete, palpable manifestation of his will, his power.\\"<br /> If it sounds familiar, think of the well-educated middle class Palestinian youth who volunteer to be suicide bombers, plus the support they receive from other Palestinians.  Pipes cites similar attitudes in Russia in the 1880's.  Terror was born as the original \\"shock and awe\\" campaign;  assassinate the Czar, and Russia would rise up in glorious revolt that would bring democracy, justice and prosperity for all.<br /> Pipes writes, \\"For some dimly understood reason, in modern societies from time to time, a sizable body of the young is seized by an overpowering destructive urge which, at the same time, exhibits self-destructive symptoms.\\"<br /> Degaev became part of a terrorist network dedicated to changing the entire social structure and attitudes of Russia by means of a few assassinations.  Terrorists killed Czar Alexander II in 1881.  But when US President James Garfield was assassinated the same year, Degaev's group wrote to Americans, \\"In a country where individual freedom offers opportunities for honest ideological struggle, where the free will of the nation determines not only the law but also the personality of those who govern  --  in such a country, political assassination as a means of struggle is a manifestation of the same despotic spirit, the destruction of which in Russia is our goal . . . . .  violence is justified only when it is directed against violence.\\"<br /> Keep in mind the vast social changes the world was seeing in the second half of the nineteenth century through industrialization and global trade;  America fought a bloody civil war pitting the new industrialism against the old slave-owning mentality.  For many, whether in America with the new industrialization or in Russia with the overthrow of the Czar, the future held unlimited promise and opportunities.<br /> It's hardly new.  Eric Hoffer in 'The True Believer' illustrates the rage of those who expect instant utopia and will blindly follow anyone who promises fulfillment.  Pipes explains that \\". . . since in our imperfect world there are always matters that can be improved, 'causes' can always be found to justify the urge to destroy and murder.\\"<br /> Degaev helped kill the head of the Czar's secret police.  Then, he fled to America where, in a society that offered him unlimited opportunity, he became a model citizen.  If you can understand Degaev, and Pipes offers an extraordinary study of his character that will fascinate anyone, you will get an insight into the mind of a terrorist.<br /> After Sept. 11, 2001, Americans asked, \\"Why do they hate us?\\"  Pipes never addresses that issue directly, but by looking into the motives of Degaev, he suggests the underlying target of terrorist hatred is their own limitations and powerlessness.  If people feel limited in their opportunities, terrorism is one response.<br /> Pipes doesn't address the issues of Sept. 11, 2001;  nor of protecting our society from terrorism.  It's not the purpose of his book.  Instead, he looks at the \\"Why\\" of terrorism andsuggests answers that also explain recent events.<br /> It's a superb book for people who like to think for themselves.d suggests answers that also explain recent events.<br /> It's a superb book for people who like to think for themselves.	2003-05-02

How do I know?  During the past 35 years, I've talked to dozens of ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico who tell many similar stories with the same buoyant spirit.  Some of her Dad's comments could have come from my Dad, who was raised on  a farm.  This book was like a trip back to any one of dozens of ranches, or my Grandma's farm.<br /> O'Connor says it's about a lost way of life.  True, in part.  Ranch kids no longer grow up living by kerosene lanterns, many now have indoor running water and even flush toilets.  The world she describes was as true of stately English manor houses a century ago, that Americans now find so charming; and Canadian farms;  and most US farms and ranches.  But even today, ranchers in remote areas of Catron and Cibola counties in New Mexico live in almost the same isolation that O'Connor describes so poetically and eloquently.<br /> Ranching is a great life, if you like isolation and the self-reliance it generates.  Keep in mind the Lazy B covered 150,000 acres, almost one quarter the area of Rhode Island.  Yet, in the fragile Southwest, seared by 100 plus degree days and less than 10-inches of rain per year, the Lazy B could support only about 2,000 cows.  It was never an easy life.  O'Connor sums it up nicely, \\"Rain was our life's blood.\\"<br /> One theme comes through loud and clear, \\"you accepted responsibility for your actions and never complained if things didn't go your way.\\"  In brief, don't whine, don't complain, don't look for others to blame, and don't hide behind someone's skirts.  Her description of making ice cream sums up rural life in the 1930s and 1940s:<br /> \\"We broke up the block of ice with an ice pick and fitted it around the metal container in the large bucket and spread the salt over the ice.  Ann, Alan, and I took turns cranking the handle.  It took about three-quarters of an hour to freeze.  When one of us tired, another would take over.  As the ice cream hardened, it was much harder to turn the crank.  When we could turn it no more, we called to MO to open it up.  She removed the salty ice at the top and then the crank handle.  Finally, off came the top, and she lifted out the paddles, or the 'dasher,' as it was called.  The child who cranked the hardest got to lick the dasher first.  Then we all piled ice cream in our bowls and ate until we felt a pain in our foreheads from the cold ice cream.  The hard work somehow made it taste better.\\"<br /> Now that she has a day job as a US Supreme Court Justice, keep those attitudes in mind whenever you hear about a legal decision by O'Connor.  She is a pure old-fashioned conservative; a believer in personal responsibility and hard work rather than handouts, excuses and born-again Christian rants.  She rarely attended formal church services;  anyone brought up on  a ranch can understand the sentiment of her father when he told her, \\"There is surely something  --  a God if you will  --  who created all of this.  And we don't have to go to church to appreciate it.  It is all around us.  This is our church.\\"<br /> She doesn't preach, moralize or offer political judgments.  Instead, she fondly looks back with a pang of regret that it can never be repeated.  Long before President George Bush made it a hollow political slogan, her family lived \\"compassionate conservatism\\" which never hesitated to help those in need, to serve their country and get things done without expecting help from others.  No work was too hard and no burden too great to defeat them; they shared a great life because, \\"The hard work somehow made it taste better.\\"<br /> Unlike Bush, who inherited or was given everything in his life, O'Connor worked for and earned everything she's accomplished.  There's a world of difference between the two paths to success;  it shows, and this book extols the merits of work instead of family connections with rich and power friends.  She is the best of all Reagan's appointments, and her contributions to making America a better place for all of us will be remembered long after his other decisions are buried and forgotten.<br /> Granted, I dealt with O'Connor when she was Senate Majority Leader in Arizona.  I liked her then for her honesty, ability and sharp intelligence.  She was the same person then as portrayed in this book, dedicated to getting the job done in a way that was honest, fair and with respect for everyone involved.<br /> You won't find a better book about Arizona ranch life, the character of an honest conservative and the good humour and determination of a woman who succeeded despite every obstacle strewn in her path.  America is better because of her, and this book fondly recalls the land, people and life that made her an outstanding conservative, jurist, parent and woman.ch and power friends.

Despite more than 30 years in the media, this book indicates Bernard Goldberg has little idea about the function, purpose or real meaning of the media.<br /> Goldberg doesn't seem to understand that \\"news\\" is not an airplane landing safely, \\"news\\" is when an airplane crashes.  In America, the government is supposed to operate honestly, efficiently and with equality for all;  news is searching for and finding examples when government falls short of these ideals.<br /> The prime function of the news media is not to flatter those in power, it is \\"to comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable.\\"  It means the media has a general \\"bias\\" against the status quo, the Establishment and conservatives because such institutions usually oppose social changes which would improve our society.<br /> Progress in America is a constant debate between the impulse to revolutionary change and a desire to preserve an unchanged past.  This free and open debate is what makes America great.  There are no final truths in America, merely a continuing debate on the nature of the balance in our society.  If you want to be a cheerleader, go write stories about sports.<br /> Bias?  Of course there's news bias.  News is reported by fallible reporters, guided by even more fallible editors (I've been both);  in Arizona, The Arizona Republic  (named for the Republican party) has never made a secret of its desire to make this a one-party Republican state.  The Tucson Citizen was even more blatant;  it's right-wing enough that a Citizen editor once told me the Wall Street Journal  is \\"a communist-front newspaper.\\"<br /> Goldberg fails to understand that all media is biased.  Objectivity to him is bias to me, and vice versa. Every reader, listener and viewer must always be skeptical;  sadly, he questions only the liberal media without understanding conservatives are equally biased.  His attack serves his purpose;  no one rushes out to buy a book which claims Rush Limbaugh, the Washington Times, Fox News or the Journal are conservative.<br /> Goldberg is as guilty of bias as those he attacks.  In other words, he's a pretentious twit (which is what critics of the Citizen used to be called).  The blunt truth is the media offers what the public wants.  Both the Citizen and the Republic in Arizona have amazing low circulation coverage, because people don't like their conservative bias.  Would a \\"liberal\\" paper do better?  It's been tried in Arizona, and every attempt has failed.  The Republic, recently bought by Gannett, is trying a more \\"middle of the road\\" approach to boost circulation  --  and conservatives are predictably denouncing the new \\"bias\\" of what liberals used to call a John Birch Society mouthpiece.<br /> Goldberg would have done far better to illustrate the bias on all sides of the news, a bias which exists because we are all human.  He should have told readers \\". . . . . here's why you should think for yourself, instead of being spoon-fed opinions by the media.\\"<br /> But then, such an \\"objective\\" view wouldn't sell many books.<br /> Of course not.  The media remains popular by staying on the attack, whether the targets of its attacks are liberal or conservative.  A century ago you could sell papers by attacking the Devil;  today, the equivalent is attacking God.  Despite that, I don't see any sign of either God or the Devil becoming unpopular or extinct.  Goldberg writes to make bundles of money, just like the comfortable complacent targets of his book.<br /> His attack is well-deserved, timely and accurate.<br /> If the media is to survive, prosper and be trusted (should I say doubted?), it should be subject to the same vitriolic attacks as the institutions it attacks.  The promise of a free media in a free society is that criticism strengthens our business, religious and social life;  likewise, the more blistering attacks on the media, the better it will do its job.<br /> The media deserves to be treated with precisely the same critical scrutiny as it gives everything else in society.  Let's say, \\"comfort the afflicted media, afflict the comfortable media.\\"<br /> The idea of media objectivity is as pretentious and false as conservative or liberal objectivity.  However, for a bitter attack on some of the most comfortable media, this is a good book to buy and read.crutiny as it gives everything else in society.

US	49694975	RHWA089Y2818G	0471264822	314307211	America Declares Independence	Books	2	20	28	N	N	A good idea  --  but hardly original	This could have been a great book, as one certainly expects from Alan Dershowitz;  unfortunately, it reflects the American belief that democracy was invented here rather than realizing this country is part of a long evolution of freedom.<br /> Dershowitz, a renowned Harvard law school professor and frequent commentator on individual rights, wastes most of his effort refuting, rejecting and attacking  the Religious Right rather than understanding such people are the bell weather of American freedom.  He doesn't seem to understand the impact of the Religious Right (or the Radical Left) is in inverse proportion to the level of freedom in this or any other country  --  as the absolute rule of the Taliban religious extremists certainly proved in Afghanistan.<br /> However, zealots exist in very society.  Perhaps they counterbalance each other;  if they become part of the Establishment, they crimp the freedom of everyone.  Dershowitz uses the massive artillery of his intellect to attack the limited acumen of Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Alan Keyes  --  as if Justice Louis Brandeis would have been profitably employed attacking Father Coughlin.<br /> Dershowitz doesn't seem to understand that freedom and individual rights have  constantly evolved in Anglo society for more than a thousand years.  Democracy wasn't invented when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, cribbing many  ideas from the English Bill of Rights written in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.  Freedom and democracy is a constant and uneven struggle, not an accident or gift .<br /> The Declaration of Independence was a quantum leap forward in defining some basic ideas of freedom, but it was not the end of the process.  Before 1776, American colonists had legitimate complaints;  the Thirteen Colonies were run by the English Colonial office, part of the executive branch of government.  Colonists were ruled by King George III and his bureaucrats, instead of their own elected officials.<br /> In response, the colonists said, in effect, \\"We're Englishmen.  We have an absolute right to be represented in Parliament.\\"  If their rights were denied, according to the Bill of Rights of 1688, they had a right to overthrow the government.  As Englishmen brought up with the Bill of Rights, the Declaration asserted their most basic rights.<br /> Out of that came The United States of America, with a Constitution written to clearly avoid problems which led to the Declaration of Independence.  Dershowitz recognizes the idea that freedom evolves in a society;  his weakness is thinking there was an immaculate birth of freedom in America in 1776.  He doesn't understand the Declaration of Independence was a bold and perfectly legitimate assertion of the basic rights of every free Englishman  --  and from this a new form of \\"Democracy in America\\" (to use Alexis de Tocqueville's phrase) evolved.<br /> There are two elements in society:  a view that people are basically evil and must be restrained for their own good, as represented by the likes of Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, Alexander Hamilton and the current Bush administration.  The countering view says people are basically good and must be free of as many social restraints as feasible, as represented by Rousseau, Voltaire and Thomas Paine and the usual Democratic politicians.<br /> Either view, if carried to the extremes of a Father Coughlin or Alan Keyes, or the excesses of the French or Russian revolutions, destroys our freedoms.<br /> Yet, history shows an uneven but very real expansion of human freedom.  When freedom is limited, the response in 1775 was the shot heard round the world;  today, the response is often footsteps that cross half the world to find freedom.<br /> This screed by Dershowitz is a rant against the Religious Right.  His recognized  talents would have been much better used to examine and explain the English origins of the  Declaration, rather than bashing baleful bigots who are mostly irrelevant ina free society.<br /> All in all, perhaps a useful book to demolish straw devils;  but, it could have been immeasurably better with a different approach.nt in a free society.<br /> All in all, perhaps a useful book to demolish straw devils;  but, it could have been immeasurably better with a different approach.	2003-04-20
US	49694975	R3D8G17NKUBVYU	0815410530	939444090	Agincourt	Books	5	4	14	N	N	This story shall the good man teach his son	The title of this review is from King Henry V by William Shakespeare, and aptly sums up this book.<br /> At Agincourt on 25 October 1415, the English were vastly outnumbered, cold, wet, hungry, on foreign soil and with vastly less equipment;  the result was one of the most dominating victories against international terrorism.<br /> France was the dominant military power in Europe, with at least 60,000 troops in the field in 1415.  King Henry V brought about 5,500 Englishmen to France in the summer of 1415, in response to the French who had raided the English coast with impunity for years.  Think of the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001;  likewise, in the early 1400s, Plymouth was burned by French marauders, the Isle of Wight had been raided the following year and later, French forces landed at Milford Haven to support Welsh rebels.<br /> Sound familiar?  Well, despite these raids, the French were \\"negotiating\\" with the English to settle differences.  Negotiating, negotiating and negotiating  --  like some nations ignore UN resolution after resolution after resolution.  Sound more familiar?  Finally, the French got serious:  They sent the English envoys back with a gift of tennis balls for the King  and told him to play with his balls rather than meddle in matters beyond his capacity.  Well, that's the story, anyway.  Sorta like Weapons of Mass Destruction.  Nations don't go to war, even against blatant evil, without good emotional reasons.<br /> King Henry V had had enough.  In November 1414, Bishop Beaufort ofr Windsor told Parliament \\"the more their King's dominions were extended, the less would their burthens become; and these things performed, great honour and glory would necessarily ensue.\\"  Besides, for the English in 1414, fighting and killing Frenchmen was fun.<br /> This isn't the type of book most Americans would read.  But, it nicely reflects current American habits of great forbearance, patience and decisive action when the time is ripe.  Like Americans now in Iraq, with access to the world's second largest oil reserves, victory meant war could be very profitable.  In the time of Henry V, profits came from prisoners of war who were later ransomed back to their homelands.<br /> Like the war on Iraq, King Henry V relied on mobility, speed and hard-hitting weapons.  As in 1940 with their Maginot Line, the French relied on armour;  the English had the five-foot long yew bows, firing a three-foot arrow with a steel tip that could penetrate a solid oak door that was four inches thick.<br /> But there was another more significant difference.  Then, as now, France was elitist;  some French knights refused to have anything to do with common soldiers.  The strength of the English army was its common soldiers who voluntarily and constantly trained to maintain their proficiency with the longbow.  They were the finest infantry in Europe.<br /> In brief, such explanations are the beauty of this book.  Obviously, since it was published in 2000, it doesn't cover the attack on the World Trade Center or the War on Iraq.  But, many of the themes are recognizable.  Hibbert doesn't merely tell us who won at Agincourt  --  the French lost about 10,000 dead, the English about 100, and the English wound up with about 1,500 high-ranking noble prisoners  --  he offers reasons why.<br /> Victory led to the recovery of all English possessions in France and made King Henry V the leader of all Christendom against the Infidels, at a time when the Crusades against Islam were the epitome of military valour.  Instead of leading a Crusade, King Henry V fell ill in the summer of 1422, and died in Vincennes at the age of 34.  His heir was a baby-king, with actual rule conducted by a regent;  they didn't have his powers of leadership or parliamentary support.  In France, faced with English indecision and confusion, Joan of Arc rallied the French and within years everything King Henry V had won was lost.ricans now in Iraq, with access to the world's second largest oil reserves, victory meant war could be very profitable.

US	49694975	R2K3FY7EO8STUG	1400040930	575332371	Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order	Books	4	33	49	N	N	Time for a 'decent respect for the opinion of mankind'?	Power makes its own morality.<br /> That, in essence, is the message of this book.  It's an old theme.  As Walther von der Vogelweide (c. 1160 - 1230) once said, \\"Might is right.\\"  Kagan justifies the unilateral use of power with the argument of the schoolyard bully, \\"He did it first.\\"<br /> The book is a brief, eloquent and brilliant exposition of the arrogance of American machtpolitik that infuriates Europe and much of the rest of humanity.  Kagan explains, East Europeans who lived under dictators understand the imposition of American power;  those who were force-fed democracy by the Americans and British after World War II, such as Germany and France, oppose the new American unilateralism.<br /> Kagan skillfully outlines how, during the Cold War, Europe relied on American power to safeguard their freedom.  When nations entrust others to defend their freedom, which is basically the meaning of the American nuclear deterrent, it's hardly surprising that one country becomes all-powerful and others atrophy into paper weasels.<br /> The book is clearly relevant to the current war in Iraq, and Kagan asserts, \\"Had Al Gore been elected, and had there been no terrorist attacks on September 11, these programs  --  aimed squarely at Bush's 'axis of evil'  --  would still be underway.\\"<br /> Great Britain is now the only European nation with a lion's heart, as the Falklands' war  showed.  France, under De Gaulle, built a \\"force de frappe\\" merely to bolster their self-esteem (\\"frappe\\" translates as \\"milkshake\\").  Kagan makes the point, \\"The American nuclear guarantee deprived Europeans of the incentive to spend the kind of money that would have been necessary to restore them to military great-power status.\\"<br /> It wasn't risk-free.  Rather than retreat to a Fortress America, Kagan says, \\"It was American military strategy to risk nuclear attack upon its otherwise unthreatened homeland in order to deter both nuclear and conventional attacks on European and Asian allies.\\"<br /> Americans expect gratitude and support for taking such risks.  Now, and this is especially true after Sept. 11, 2001, America views the world as threatened by an immoral Hobbesian chaos which must be tamed by decisive military force.  Kagan says Europeans have an \\"emphasis on negotiation, diplomacy, and commercial ties, on international law over the use of force, on seduction over coercion, on multilateralism over unilateralism.<br /> \\"Who knows better than Europeans the dangers that arise from unbridled power politics, from an excessive reliance on military force, from policies produced by nationbal egoism and ambition, even from balance of power and raison d'etat?\\" Kagan asks.<br /> Kagan bases his views on practical experience, including four years in the State Department under President Ronald Reagan.  He is now director of the 'U.S. Leadership Project' at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.<br /> In contrast to the current policies, which are more blunt but otherwise quite similar to Clinton policies, he thinks America should remember some words from the Declaration of Independence and show a \\"decent respect for the opinion of mankind.\\"<br /> \\"But, after all, it is more than a clich&eacute; that the United States and Europe share a set of common Western beliefs.  Their aspirations for humanity are much the same, even if their vast disparity of power has now put them in very different places.  Perhaps it is not too naively optimistic to believe that a little common understanding could still go a long way,\\" he concludes.<br /> Ten years ago, Francis Fukuyama declared history was over.  This book shows history is a phoenix arising from the ashes of such irrational exuberance.<br /> This book opens up a hornets' nest of ideas.  Kagan succinctly describes the growing rift between America and Europe, but leaves the reader to decide who is wrong and what might be done to correct the imbalance.  Do we really want a Europe powerful enough to challenge America?  Do we really want a continuing imbalance of power?  Can gentle words tame an opportunistic dictator?  Is the status quo acceptable?  How can nations limit the powerful?<br /> Kagan deftly outlines the problem.  He's very unAmerican in not offering a unilateral solution.  He leaves it to readers who like to think to consider the alternatives.Do we really want a continuing imbalance of power?  Can gentle words tame an opportunistic dictator?

Bush, An Inside Account	Books	4	55	76	N	N	An insight into what motivates George Bush	This may well be the best book written about President George Bush until long after he leaves office  --  provided his future biographers can match Frum's insight, intellect, innocence and industry.<br /> With devastating candor, reinforced by hero worship, Frum details the intensity of the control freaks who run the Bush administration.  He unveils a staff more dedicated to total loyalty to a leader than is ever seen on The Sopranos, showing an image of sterile tidiness that is shocked by Clinton staffers who anything as crude as pizza at midnight.<br /> As an outsider, despite his wet puppy craving for affection, Frum offers a variety of devastating  --  or magnificently uplifting  --  insights into the character and goals of Bush.  This is a book that will thrill every conservative and dismay anyone who thinks for himself.<br /> Frum, like Bush, is not satisfied with being right unless he can prove others wrong.  Thus, the 'you are with us or with the terrorists' fanaticism;  control freaks never tolerate an independent thought.  It is hardly surprising that so few outside the US share this fanaticism;  maybe it's because \\"them furriners\\" know that anyone who is as war with others is not at peace with themself.<br /> Let's face it:  Bush has the world's toughest job.  Anything he does affects the world.  Nothing that 98 percent of the world's leaders do has more than a ripple impact on events;  for example, a unilateral decision by Canada to launch a war on terror would heard merely as a superb example of Canadian humour instead of courageous resolve.<br /> Frum is a superb writer, analyst and story teller, skilled at using what he says is a Bush technique.  He says Bush wins loyalty by sharing little personal secrets with those in a  personal conversation, \\"thrusting a gift upon us, the most precious gift a person can offer:  a little piece of himself.  By revealing himself to us, he bound us to him.\\"  This book is filled with such personal insights in an effort to generate loyalty for Bush.  You won't find many \\"insider\\" books that are better than Frum.<br /> So why does Bush so infuriate people?  Well, if he's right, he invalidates generations of wishful dreams and empty thoughts that have guided American policy toward the Arabs for at least the past 50 years.  If he's wrong, his bumbling bombast will give us generations of unrest, terror and war.  Our future rests on the roll of Bush's iron dice.<br /> Whether you like or fear Bush, there's plenty here to reinforce your views in a bright, candid and easy-to-read 284 pages.  Conservatives will finish it and contentedly sigh, \\"Thank God.\\"  With a tremor in their voice, liberals will beg, \\"Please, God . . .\\"<br /> Quite simply, Frum says, Bush intends to remake the Arab world.  He sees Iraq, an ally of the Nazis in 1940, as merely the first and wobbliest domino.  Bush is tired of oil patch tyrants.  By the time US troops come home, he expects every Arab will know the meaning of \\"a government of all the people, by all the people, for all the people.\\"<br /> No, that isn't a Lincoln quote.  It's from Theodore Parker on May 29, 1850, at the NE Anti-Slavery Convention in Boston.  Like Parker, Bush intends to set in motion a great chain of events such as those which ended slavery by 1865 in the US.  Frum hopes a similar vision will topple tyranny in today's Arab world.<br /> So, what is Bush like?  Frum concludes, \\"He is impatient and quick to anger; sometimes glib, even dogmatic;  often uncurious and as a result ill informed;  more convention in his thinking than a leader probably should be.  But outweighing the faults are his virtues:  decency, honesty, rectitude, courage, and tenacity.\\"<br /> Anyone, on either side of Bush's crusade to reorder, reform and remap the Arab world will find this book to be an Aladdin's treasure of fascinating information, opinions and dreams.

That's the complaint from a couple of hundred years ago.  Today's whine, articulately offered by Bryson, is that England's hedgerows are disappearing.  In addition, city planners make a mess of things.  My, my, isn't progress terrible!  Just think, if we don't hold onto the past  . . .  the future may happen.<br /> Bryson offers the typical American view of England;  a lovely place because of its ancient heritage, and please don't let the natives spoil it for the tourists.  Time and again I've seen similar American tourists of limited acumen visit Native American reservations to gaze in awe at rug weaving, basket making, jewelry making and native dances.  Whether in England, Mexico or Native American reservations, the request is similar:  &quot;Show us your native culture, do a traditional dance for us, sing us a traditional chant or song  --  your poverty is so charming and noble.&quot;<br /> Such tourists are shocked to find a Burger King in Chinle, the heart of the Navajo Nation, and in any little English village.  Bryson is shocked by Milton Keynes, a master-planned community built after World War II;  but doesn't compare it to master-planned communities scattered hither and yon with less planning across the US landscape.  The US holds the world championship for ravaging the environment;  England lags woefully.<br /> His book reads like a collection of supposedly clever newspaper columns patched together in a hurry for a quick book.  Granted, England  --  like America  --  has a lot of problems.  Bryson moans to no end about the declining train service in England;  one of these days, he needs to take a look at public transportation in America.  It might give him enough perspective to judge England less harshly, and with greater understanding.<br /> England's declining industries are well represented by the closed mills;  in the US, the &quot;rust belt&quot; is the equivalent.  Yet, when it comes to innovative new autos, for example  --  think of the new Mini Cooper;  ideas like that don't come from the US, which counts on imports from Japan or Europe for new ideas.<br /> In brief, Bryson is an expert at finding fault without understanding.<br /> This book is a superb description of the England tourists seldom see.  He sounds like people I know who do live in England and who plan to get out as fast as possible.  If you like the grim side of a country, a celebration of the shortcomings, inconveniences and headaches large and small, this is the book for you.<br /> Personally, having visited England years before Bryson, I learned one thing:  if you don't like rain, buy a raincoat.  If you don't want to wear a raincoat, don't complain about the rain.  This book would have been much better, and probably much funnier, had Bryson invested a couple of quid in a raincoat.with greater understanding.<br /> England's declining industries are well represented by the closed mills;  in the US, the &quot;rust belt&quot; is the equivalent.

If you like the grim side of a country, a celebration of the shortcomings, inconveniences and headaches large and small, this is the book for you.<br /> Personally, having visited England years before Bryson, I learned one thing:  if you don't like rain, buy a raincoat.  If you don't want to wear a raincoat, don't complain about the rain.  This book would have been much better, and probably much funnier, had Bryson invested a couple of quid in a raincoat.	2003-03-17

Browning goes straight for the heart in this story.<br /> Trust is the basis of all human relationships.  Trade Ellis, the fictional private eye who Browning writes about, usually handles routine investigations.  But when old school friends come to her for help, before their class 25th reunion party, she sets aside her doubts about investigating murder and trusts her friends from school.  Her task, with four people already dead, is to discover who is killing their senior year cheerleading squad.<br /> She weaves a chilling story, packed with authentic detail that is obviously based on reliable law enforcement sources.  She lists Asa Bushnell from the Pima County Sheriff's office as a source;  I've known Asa since 1972, and he is one of the most honorable and decent newsmen ever to have worked at The Tucson Citizen and later as a press officer in the sheriff's office.  Using Asa as a source on crime is better than having the Pope as a reference on Catholicism.  She couldn't have found a better source.<br /> Second, she has a superb feel for Arizona ranch operations.  She knows the area she writes about, I've hiked it on foot and driven through it dozens of times.  Browning presents a deft and accurate image of Tucson on the other side of the mountains, it's a relief to find a mystery writer who describes in loving detail something more than a hero's macho manly motives and mischief.  She offers an accurate look into the real Arizona outside the city limits.<br /> But, the essence of her story is the betrayal of trust.  In a criminal case, the police suspect everyone, similar to a reporter's standard level of suspicion, \\"If your Mum says she loves you, check it out.\\"  Trade Ellis is neither cop nor reporter, she's a private investigator who trusts some old school friends and ends up betrayed.<br /> Some people are like that.  Unlike some criminals, who have the courage to face their victims, cowards rely on the trust, honor and decency of their victims to lure them into betrayal.  In this case, it's marital betrayal;  the fury of a frantic woman who discovered she could not trust someone and so set about eliminating all possible rivals.<br /> You know the old saying, \\"A man suspects one other man, a woman suspects every other woman.\\"  Okay, so that's the start.  When sexual betrayal is uncovered, it literally tears the victim's heart out and tramples it in the dust.  Nothing is so cruel as this betrayal of trust.  Browning captures this mood deftly.  It leaves the victim shattered.  Be prepared to learn what the impact of betrayal is like, and how it destroys lives.<br /> Now, take those components  --  authentic settings and police procedures plus a motive that strikes fear into any decent heart  --  and you have the mixture for a more than ordinary mystery.  What's more, she writes with a great sense of humor.  Browning combines it all into a great story.<br /> Browning isn't an ordinary mystery writer.  She's much better.  Thank goodness some intelligent women are expanding the genre beyond blood, guts, guns and senseless fists and instead creating stories about motivations instead of mere mayhem.<br />.She's written at least two later Trade Ellis mysteries.  This is one mystery writer who deserves success.  Read it.  You'll be delighted.friends and ends up betrayed.<br /> Some people are like that.

US	49694975	R29MA08YGO0DKK	0316602051	985416391	The Jester	Books	5	3	9	N	N	A man's allowed to dream every once in a while	This is a great story.<br /> Patterson doesn't sugar coat the Dark Ages, which is the setting for this entrancing story which sounds as though it could have been lifted from the newspapers of the era  --  had newspapers existed then.<br /> It's not a book for the squeamish.  He writes of the rapacious terror the Crusaders brought to the Holy Land in their attacks on the Islamic world;  if anyone wonders \\"Why don't they like us?\\"  --  this book offers a compelling answer.  Some of his characters may seem unreal, but from what I've read of the Dark Ages the general setting Patterson uses is totally authentic.  It was an era when wild animals roamed at will, when during the winter wolves preyed on people even in cities such as Paris;  and when such animals offered kind mercy compared to the cruelty of people to each other.<br /> Patterson makes life sound brutal, grim and often capricious.  He paints a chilling picture of the total madness of Christian fanaticism inspired by fictional artifacts such as \\"relics\\" said to have an association with Christ.  If you've ever wondered about the madness that religion can inspire, this book is a gripping insight into the reality of our past.<br /> Okay, that's the dark, authentic, frightening side of Jester.  But the book is much more, it is also an account of the nascent demands for personal freedom, dignity, and the rule of law that applies to everyone  ---  not merely to the nobility and clergy.  Peasant uprisings were a fact of the era, and Patterson masterfully explains the motivations that led people in their search for freedom to challenge everything they had been told by the church and the nobility.<br /> \\"A man's allowed to dream every once in a while,\\" an older and wiser jester tells Hugh De Luc, the main character who also becomes a jester.  Patterson is masterful in using a jester as his central character;  in an era of rigid social structures, this (and the mistresses of a King) were about the only people with fluid social mobility.<br /> It's a masterful story of men, and equally courageous women, plus the people they inspire, making dreams of freedom come true.  I wouldn't be surprised if Patterson or his researchers used an actual incident, then wove his story around historic fact.<br /> If it sounds like the same spirit that inspired the American Revolution in 1775, it's because Patterson taps into feelings that are very basic and real in all Americans.  Maybe, some day, he'll do an equally inspired book about the motives that made American farmers challenge the world's mightiest empire in a bold assertion of their own freedom.<br /> It's a basic conflict involving, in Patterson's own words, \\"what we know as the law\\" and \\"the courage to stand up ...\\"  Or, to quote Augustine who said, \\"Remove justice, and what are kingdoms but gangs of criminals on a large scale.\\"  If this book sounds authentically  medieval, and realistically modern, it's because Patterson skillfully explores basic issues that apply today as they did a thousand years ago.<br /> My only quibble is his ending.  Although Patterson tells a superb story, he doesn't seem to know how to create a reasonable ending.  It's always some \\"deus ex machina,\\" which in this case is totally unnecessary.  In this case, it doesn't really spoil the book  --  it's like meeting a sand flea on an otherwise perfect day on the beach.<br /> But, it's not a book for the squeamish.  He doesn't overdo the blood and gore, or the brutal cruelty that was so often commonplace and routine at the time of the Crusadses;  but, it will upset the tender feelings of sensitive souls.  He is brutal, honest, frank and realistic  --  without any of the familiar movie-screen excess.<br /> So much the better.  It's a slice of authentic Dark Ages life.  As an added bonus, he adds a list of 15 historical books for anyone interested in further doses of reality.  Like Louis L'Amour in The Walking Drum,  Patterson has written a first-rate introduction to ourpast.our past.	2003-03-13

Think of Barry Goldwater, or Stu and Mo Udall, as the epitome of political idealism and the graveyard of personal achievement.<br /> In a nation based on the idea that errors of opinion may be safely tolerated where reason is left free to combat them, McCain poses as a champion of restricting open political debate.  Ironically, his McCain-Feingold bill to ban soft money in politics contained a neon sign pointing the easy way to simple evasion, allowing &quot;unaffiliated&quot; campaign committees to raise the same money from the same influence peddlers to achieve the same results.<br /> Political limits have been sought for hundreds of years;  in America, some of the first limits were ending the free whiskey for one's supporters on election day.  Teddy Roosevelt banned corporate donations in 1907, and McCain is merely the latest but surely not the last in a long line of distinguished opponents of political influence peddling.<br /> Drew, an excellent reporter, does a masterful job in detailing the long intrigues that bedevil all legislation.  She has a good knowledge of the legislative process, and her this alone her book is a revealing insight into just what goes into the making of our laws.<br /> The sad part, of course, is that McCain's efforts are meaningless.  Money pours into politics for one simple reason  --  donations buy favorable results for donors.  People rarely give to politicians to improve the community;  it's a pity McCain didn't learn this as a charter member of the Keating 8.  If donors were really interested in good government, they'd buy snowplows for Washington. D.C., rather than giving &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; to politicians.<br /> McCain is a maverick, as gutsy in politics as his grandfather was as an admiral in the Pacific in World War II.  Like Goldwater, like his grandfather, John is totally authentic (okay, I've known McCain since his first campaign in 1982).  Like Goldwater, his success may not be measured in immediate results;  but, look for McCain's name to sound long and true if the campaign to make politics more open, honest, candid and accessible to everyone someday achieves positive results.<br />  This is why Drew is worth reading;  granted, she's wrapped up in campaign finance reform, but she touches some undercurrents in modern society that McCain has tapped.  Like Don Quixote, McCain's aim is true;  unlike Quixote, McCain's efforts may may pay off in another 20 or 30 years with a birth of new honesty in politics.<br /> McCain is a masterful politician, and Drew nicely captures these skills.  He is genuinely committed to public service for the public good;  before his first campaign, he talked to a wide range of Arizonans about a potential role in state politics.  His first thought was to run for the legislature;  when a Congressional seat opened up, he seized the opportunity and won a close but significant victory in a state where the largest newspaper open favored conservative Republicans.<br /> Like his grandfather, John McCain III knows how to seize opportunity when it arises.  Many politicians are 90 percent show and 10 percent candor;  McCain is the opposite, and it is this honesty which Drew so nicely portrays that has made him into yet another national figure from Arizona.ested in good government, they'd buy snowplows for Washington.

Based on her background and experience, she set out to understand and learn one of the traditional crafts  --  weaving a rug from raw wool to finished product.  It looks easy.  After all, lots of Anglos weave.  Some even spin yarn.  The whole process, from raw wool to a finished rug that is work of art, sounds simple in the telling;  but, reality is different.<br /> Let me give you an example.  Fry bread is a traditional Navajo food, which almost every woman can make without thinking.  It's as natural as walking.  Maybe one of the simplest of traditional Navajo skills.  I've tried to learn one element of it, taking a small ball of dough and patting and kneading it out to a circle about a foot in diameter that is then dropped into hot oil to be cooked to a golden brown.<br /> It was a lot of fun.  The Navajos got a lot of amusement out of watching me try and mostly fail, day after day.  I had fun trying.  My &quot;teacher&quot; was kind, helpful, patient and amused;  she'd show me again and again, but I inevitably ended up with a lumpy disc of dough that she'd patiently pat into a proper circle before laying it in the frying pan.<br /> In other words, it ain't as easy as it looks.<br /> Bennett undertook a similar but far more complicated learning experience in the 1960s.  Unlike me, she stayed with it and became skilled.  One result is this book, a sensitive semi-insider's look at a traditional craft that exemplifies one of the few genuine American art forms.  Her desire to learn was appreciated by her Navajo friends;  one reward is she becomes a target of their good natured humor, a friend of the family.<br /> Many outsiders &quot;study&quot; and patronize Native American cultures;  Bennett became part of it.  There is a genuine &quot;Us vs. Them&quot; attitude among the Navajo, with very good reason based on the constant Bordertown (Gallup, Winslow, Holbrook, Flagstaff, Farmington, etc.) prejudice and exploitation.  The Navajos came to regard Bennett as one of &quot;the People,&quot; so when it came to entering a rug in an off-reservation exhibition her Navajo friends helped her evade some pretentious Anglo rules.<br /> It's always fun to poke fun at the bilagaana (Anglos).  Their pretensions are too good not to laugh at.<br /> Americans like to think, &quot;Underneath, everyone is basically the same.&quot;  Bennett appreciates there are fundamental differences between Navajo and Anglo cultures.  She touches on it, such as the importance of &quot;four&quot; in Navajo culture.  Anglo culture is based on &quot;three,&quot; such as the Trinity in religion and three examples if you want to prove something;  Navajo culture has &quot;four&quot; as typified by the four cardinal directions, four sacred mountains, four basic colors, four precious materials for jewelry.<br /> Bennett cites these examples, but she never really delves into the meaning of these cultural differences.  For example, Anglos live in a confrontational culture of guilt or innocence;  Navajos live in a consensus culture in which K'e, the spirit of harmony, is more important.<br /> But, she lived in the western Navajo Nation where the more traditional people live;  the eastern side, where I lived, is more accustomed to pushy Anglos.  She feigns shock at some Anglo ways;  my experience is that most Navajos fully understand the aggressive Anglo world and its rude contrast with their patience.  She is more of a nizhoni (beautiful) person;  I'm more of the Ma'ii tso (which has far more meanings than simply &quot;fox&quot;).<br /> In general, though, she offers a sympathetic, intelligent insight into rug weaving  -- one of the integral elements of Navajo culture.  Her book is the epitome of Anglo culture  --  an &quot;insider's&quot; view of a different culture, one that most people will never see and even fewer will ever have a chance to begin to understand.<br />It's well worth buying, reading, keeping and sharing with friends.e of Anglo culture  --  an &quot;insider's&quot; view of a different culture, one that most people will never see and even fewer will ever have a chance to begin to understand.  <br />It's well worth buying, reading, keeping and sharing with friends.	2003-02-28

Fact:  Crime in Phoenix is almost double the rate for New York city, and property crime is more than double.  Fact:  culturally, Phoenix is still a cow town, but now it is also a high crime town.<br /> Talton bases his story on these facts, presenting a hard-boiled story of crime and corruption in Phoenix.  It is a story that is almost ignored by the daily press, which provides Talton with his day job;  Talton is one of the first writers to fictionalize the reality of \\"the good life\\" in the sunshine of the Southwest.  If you want a up-to-date factual account of the drug business along the US-Mexico border, look up Tucson author Charles Bowden.<br /> Supposedly a fourth generation Arizonan, he's sometimes sloppy on easy to check facts, such as asserting Arizona had about 50,000 people when it became a state in 1912.  The fact is closer to 200,000 by 1910.  He offers a common theme that explosive growth has destroyed the old time atmosphere, apparently unaware that Arizona almost doubled in population in the decade preceding statehood.  Yet, this whining about the passing of the \\"good ol' days\\" is a prevalent theme, the excuse used by long time residents to justify doing little or nothing about current problems.<br /> It's an ideal setting for Talton's fictional investigator, failed history professor David Mapstone who's returned to Phoenix and been hired on a free-lance basis by an old friend in the Sheriff's Office.  His job?  Investigate old unsolved crimes, and see if he can come up with something new.  It provides him with a job as a sworn sheriff's deputy and a license to do pretty much as he wants, including hot-dogging as a lone-wolf investigator of recent murders.<br /> The principle villains, of course, are an Iranian immigrant and a corrupt politician.  It's a nice bit of politically correct typecasting.  The politician is vanquished, of course, but the Iranian villain lives on to generate villainy for future novels.  If this sounds strange, keep in mind that of the last four elected governors of Arizona one was impeached and removed from office, another resigned after being indicted for criminal fraud and eventually pardoned by President Bill Clinton, whom he had never failed to denounce while in office.<br /> Although the book is fiction, nothing Talton writes about is implausible in Phoenix or Arizona.  That's what makes it so interesting;  he's a wide-eyed innocent in pursuit of a good story, largely unaware of the cynicism of crime, politics and opportunism in Arizona.  After all, too much of a good thing  --  or bad thing, as the case may be  --  tends to make fiction unreal.  Talton manages a nice enough balance to create a fast-paced story.<br /> All in all, it's a good introduction to the real Phoenix.  <br /> The Chamber of Commerce isn't going to like his books;  but then, the Chamber and its blindness to problems is one reason the crime rate is so high.  Perhaps if Talton can make a series out of these books, he'll generate enough heat and controversy that the police and sheriff's office will make an effort to clean up some of the persistent crime.<br /> But then, in Phoenix old timers always found it easier to ignore or cover-up rather than confront problems.  Talton, or his alter ego Mapstone, is an exception to that old habit.  It provides the foundation for what should be a good series of books, and an intriguing unraveling of the social problems of the area.  <br /> This book is a good start on what could become a fascinating series.His second book, \\"Camelback Falls,\\" is even better.  Let's hope he continues improving, and that he finds a growing audience interesting in learning about the real Phoenix behind the stucco and red-tile roofed facade of precocious respectability.	2003-01-20

US	49694975	R23N2OV7Q29CMA	0738204005	621059543	Coal: A Human History	Books	5	26	39	N	N	To build a world that no longer needs coal . . . . .	This is a truly remarkable book.<br /> In time, and hopefully in the not-too-distant future, Barbara Freese will attain the well-deserved stature that Rachel Carson  achieved with \\"Silent Spring\\" just 40 years ago  --  or Sinclair Lewis a century ago when he exposed the horrors of the meat packing industry.<br /> As Freese so eloquently illustrates, it's hard to dislike coal.  Her history credits coal, plus a variety of lucky accidents, with being the foundation of almost everything we love and hold dear in our industrial-intellectual-materialist modern luxury.  The ability of coal to produce energy has been known for thousands of years, but it took many new ways of thinking to unleash the latent power of coal as the fuel of industrialization.<br /> Freese treads lightly though the history of coal, showing how a unique combination of events and circumstances made it the fuel of choice in England at the time of William Shakespeare was writing and Queen Elizabeth I.  The US trailed England until the latter half of the nineteenth century when coal made this country the most powerful nation on earth.<br /> Given that, it's hard to picture the US giving up King Coal to adopt alternatives.  After all, could America give up King George III to adopt a democratic alternative? England, in the 1600s, made the change which led to industrialization;  at about the same time, China didn't and plummeted from being the world's most powerful economy into a helpless undemocratic giant by 1800.<br /> Granted, such decisions don't hinge on the next election  - -  or the last one.  The basic change may take a century;  but, Freese argues, unless fundamental changes are made in our source of energy, we face certain disaster.  Of course, England, China and every coal-based economy faces similar challenges within the same time frame.<br /> The problem, as Freese points out, is that dramatic global climate change hinges on a few degrees in temperature.  The last Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago, was only 5 degrees Celsius colder than today;  and that change occurred within a decade.  Within another century, unless energy policies change, global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels could send temperatures up another 5 degrees Celsius and melt the last of the ice caps  - -  which are already melting.<br /> One possibility is rising oceans, which drown out coastal regions where most people now live.  The other is rising oceans, putting vastly more moisture and carbon dioxide in the air which cuts off sunlight, chilling the planet enough to trigger massive snowstorms that create another Ice Age.  Take your pick.  That is the future we face if we don't act.<br /> England, some 400 years ago, faced a similar \\"energy crisis\\" due to over-cutting of forests to provide basic energy plus the charcoal needed to smelt iron.  Coal was quickly adopted to provide heat, but it took a century to learn how to make coke to smelt iron.  The result produced the Industrial Revolution.<br /> Freese says we must find an alternative  . . . . .  or else.  Carson said as much in \\"Silent Spring\\" -- find an alternative to DDT or face the consequences of widespread environmental poisoning.  The beauty of America is its ability to overcome such challenges and improve results for everyone.<br /> She is also wise enough to point out that well-meaning, sincere and sometimes intelligent people will say nothing new needs to be done.

US	49694975	R6JKI4QTHMWDF	1401300057	930186214	Firehouse	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The quiet courage of Americans	This book sums up the problem with Halberstam's career in journalism  - - -  he has an ongoing fascination with power, courage, heroism and duty without ever quite understanding the origins of these qualities of character.<br /> Quite simply, courage exists because anything else is unthinkable.<br /> This is a tribute to firefighters who responded to the destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  It may well be the best book written about the human side of the event, a focus on one firehouse where 12 of the 13 men who responded were killed.  Anyone who's read The New York Times since is very familiar with the format of personal snapshots that Halberstam uses, and he does a credible job in a much expanded version of what the Times could ever offer.<br /> But, he seems to be left grasping for an answer to \\"Why did they do it?\\"<br /> My response, quite simply, is because they couldn't do anything else.<br /> Halberstam outlines the spirit of camaraderie among firefighters in the first half of the book, very similar to a military unit where people train, live, play and work together.  They become family, as close as their other families of wives and parents and children;  like a good family, they don't \\"think\\" of danger to each other  - - -  they feel it instinctively.<br /> It's the same reaction that occurs in good military units, and among the crews of good ships.  Unlike the police, who often have the luxury of waiting for negotiators to defuse a tense situation, firefighters must respond immediately.  As Halbertsam points out, being as much as a minute late may cost lives that could otherwise have been saved.<br /> His observations from firefighters are like those of soldiers I've interviewed who served in World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.  It reflects what I've found to be an underlying but absolutely rock-solid quality of Americans  - - -  regardless of the person, their unquestioning dedication to honor, duty, loyalty when the chips are down.<br /> Halberstam offers all the ingredients of this \\"pudding\\" in his book, which I think every reader will recognize.  My one complaint is that he fails to draw it all together into a coherent analysis and tribute to the enduring American character.  In that, he's very like the firefighters he describes;  they don't boast, and they're not overly introspective  - - -  they simply do what needs to be done when whatever it is needs doing.<br /> Perhaps it takes a non-American to recognize this fundamental quality of most Americans;  not just firefighters, but of all Americans when faced with a crisis.  Like most brave people, firefighters don't flaunt their courage;  like the astute journalist he is, Halberstam doesn't invent reasons his subjects don't talk about.<br /> Yet, it is all in his book.  Time and again, readers will recognize gems of courage, duty, honor and selfless dedication to family that good firefighters posses.  Perhaps it's the best way to describe what motivated the  men of Engine 40/Ladder 35 who responded and died that fateful day.  They didn't boast, Halberstam doesn't.  Instead, he tells the story of these men who are so like the firefighters in every community.  In his low-key manner, he describes qualities of ordinary Americans which draws the admiration of the world.<br /> Had he tried for more, he would have come across as a pretentious twit.  Instead, when you read this book, there's a real sense of the heroism that shone through like a beacon on Sept. 11, 2001.  Halberstam has done a masterful job.<br />  As a foreigner, let me recommend this book as a superb even if understated tribute to the quiet courage of Americans, and especially firefighters.e down.<br /> Halberstam offers all the ingredients of this \\"pudding\\" in his book, which I think every reader will recognize.

US	49694975	R1LSFY9ARX634R	0312304048	501601290	Camelback Falls: A David Mapstone Mystery	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Phoenix -- from Cow Town to Crime Town	This is a good book.<br /> Before going further, it is worth noting that Phoenix and Arizona have some of the highest crime rates in the nation.  That's not what the Chamber of Commerce, tourism bureau and local newspaper will admit, but it's true.  Do as I did, look at the FBI Uniform Crime Reports.  I did after moving here in 1972, and often since then;  the figures are consistent, this is one of the most crime plagued areas in the nation.<br /> Talton writes a compelling story about crime in the Phoenix area, with a fictional sheriff as his hero.  The real sheriff is a clown, courting constant publicity by forming chain gangs for prisoners, serving rotten food (he's proud of his green bologna), dressing inmates in pink underwear, narrowly evading imaginary plots on his life, housing inmates in tents in 120-degree weather, and costing the county millions of dollars in lawsuits filed in response to brutality by his deputies.<br /> The sheriff's predecessors include a man who'd been married 10 or so times, and another who was formerly a lawnmower repairman.  They weren't as \\"tough\\" as the current sheriff.<br /> Although his central plot is fictional, Talton larded it with real incidents in the Phoenix area.  When he cites to Mesa officers using their shift breaks to have sex with each other, such sex games really happened.  When he writes about the local newspaper by saying one of it's stories \\"got things about half right\\"  - - -  it flatters his current bosses, since he can't afford to lose his day job yet.<br /> Yet, based on my personal experience as a reporter covering trials and in the governor's office, Talton paints a devastatingly accurate picture of police corruption, indifference, arrogance and bullying.  Time and again, his examples are based on actual events.  For example, in my neighborhood police teamed up with local gang members who are willing to fight the Los Angeles-based Crips and Bloods.<br /> Earlier, I mentioned high crime rates.  It would probably be the highest rate in the nation except for one factor  - - -  the police refuse to take reports on crimes such as burglary and attempted auto theft.  I've been burglarized half-a-dozen times, the recent police response is always, \\"Don't call us, your insurance company handles those complaints.\\"<br /> How bad is crime?  Well, in the early 1980s, Sen. Barry Goldwater moved his office out of downtown Phoenix because the high crime rate made many people too afraid to visit it.  Today, neither of Arizona's Senators, John McCain and Jon Kyl, have downtown Phoenix offices.<br /> In police terms, and I learned this from the police many years ago, many local cops are \\"cash registers.\\"  It means an emphasis on writing tickets to produce revenue, not on preventing or solving crimes.  It's why almost every new subdivision in Arizona is surrounded by walls, a desperate attempt by residents to protect themselves.  In response, city officials want to impose new ordinances to limit the size of walls that people may build to protect their homes and families.<br /> Talton portrays this ambiance of Phoenix with rare skill and cheeky verve.  Such candor is never reflected in the local papers, which believe in \\"press release\\" journalism rather than showing initiative.  I know the neighborhoods he writes about, and his book offers a chillingly authentic view of the wide open nature of Phoenix.<br />  Camelback Falls underlines the reason why three out of five people who move to the Phoenix area leave within a year;  the combination of high crime, police indifference and corruption, plus 100 days when the daily temperature is more than 100 degrees is enough to drive any rational person away.<br /> Keep in mind, Talton writes about middle class neighborhoods.  In the barrios, whole families  - -  father, mother, three killed  - -  have been killed execution style, but the police never make an arrest.  Why?  Few people, if any, trust the police.  As for the police, they don't care; promotions are made on the basis of revenue-producing tickets.<br /> Talton writes about the real Phoenix, not the tourist version.  It's an easy four-hour read, well worth your time before visiting or moving to Phoenix.  Read it, Talton paints a chilling picture of how local officials are letting a once beautiful city become a Third World ghetto.<br />  Read it.  If enough people read it and respond, perhaps something will be done.  We'd appreciate any help outraged readers may offer.

US	49694975	R2L48QLNSDU07N	0684871009	764224185	The Cat Who Covered The World: The Adventures Of Henrietta And Her Foreign Correspondent	Books	5	1	1	N	N	If only people were as smart as cats	This is a wonderful book.<br />Obviously, I have cats . . . . . or cats have me, as the case may be. My opinion is based on living with cats, which enables me to judge Wren's assessments on the basis of shared experience. Wren truly knows cats, and obviously Henrietta was able to sum up his qualities quite neatly and with a beautiful sense of humour. It reflects the inner and deeper qualities of Times reporters.<br />Ostensibly, this book is about travels with a cat. If that sounds strange, think of John Steinbeck's Travels With Charlie after years of his writing semi-intelligible crap about the great issues of mankind in general and America in particular. Some of Steinbeck's sorriest writing came when he was trying to be most relevant, such as his World War II novel The Moon Is Down. His best writing came when he wrote as a reporter, from The Grapes of Wrath to Travels With Charlie.<br />Wren is a great reporter, and this book reflects the habits and attitudes of people in the various countries where he was a correspondent. It's one thing to talk of Soviet bureaucracy, and South African Afrikaaner blind arrogance, or Canada's silly nationalism; but, when Wren describes such attitudes when dealing with his cat, the peccadilloes of various cultures becomes glaring in their absurdity.<br />As a Canadian, I can attest to his experiences in taking Henrietta to Ottawa as a classic portrayal of Canadian silliness (which I have encountered at the border). When the The New York Times posted Wren to Canada, the following dialogue occurred:<br />INSPECTOR: What are you doing in Canada ?<br />ME: I'm covering it for The New York Times.<br />INSPECTOR: Why can't your job be filled by a Canadian ?<br />Touche. Wren is skilled at presenting such inanities throughout the world, often prompted by his experiences of traveling and living with his cat in various countries. The usual journalistic practice is to write dead-serious \\"thumb-suckers,\\" those long introspective articles that probe, analyze and explain the inner meanings of esoteric issues. But, such articles have much greater impact when they can be explained in terms of an analogy, which is the accomplishment Wren manages superbly in this book.<br />As Wren sums up, Henrietta was \\"an ordinary cat who thrived on extraordinary adventures.\\" We all live like that. It's just that Wren is able to express it so succinctly. Sometimes we just need to look at ourselves through the eyes of a cat in order to understand.<br />Writing such as this book is what makes The New York Times the finest newspaper in this nation.<br />Sadly, it also illustrates a great weakness of the Times. Every day, The Wall Street Journal offers in its middle column on page 1 stories such as those in this book - - - and they invariable explain the world in far better terms than most of the \\"thumb-suckers\\" that plague so-called \\"serious\\" journalism.<br />Hopefully, someday an editor as the Times will read Wren's book and ask, \\"Why can't we get our reporters to write stories like this ?\\" and then, it will slowly dawn that \\"We do have reporters like this, we just stifle their creativity.\\"<br />So, until \\"the old gray lady\\" learns to appreciate the superb talent of its reporters who can produce books like these . . . . . well, you'll just have to buy books like this. You won't find many that are any better in terms of explaining the human condition.<br />It is a wonderful book.probe, analyze and explain the inner meanings of esoteric issues.

Alexis de Tocqueville, from France, wrote \\"Democracy in America\\" in  (1835 and 1840), still the most penetrating and insightful view of the character and core values of American democracy.  It took Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw to best understand the English  --  no Englishman could write \\"Pygmalion\\" upon which \\"My Fair Lady\\" is based.<br /> Novelist Bernard Malamud summed it up nicely, \\"The whole history of baseball has the quality of mythology.\\"  In about 150 quotes, this book brings that mythology to life.<br /> Kinsella is a master observer of baseball.  His \\"Shoeless Joe\\"  became the classic \\"Field of Dreams\\" in 1989, the best film yet about the spirit that motivates boys and men to play, watch, understand and love baseball.  This is a story of redemption and faith in the best American tradition, and the film captures the magic of Kinsella's story.<br /> Baseball is not like other sports.  It is a game in which each individual player faces the entire opposing team alone, in batting and base running to score points.  Think of Canada's ice hockey in similar terms  --  requiring a single player to face nine opponents to score a goal.  It's tough enough to \\"kill a penalty\\" in hockey when a team is one player short; hockey, like most sports, is a team effort.<br /> Baseball reflects the American spirit, a \\"lone eagle\\" against the world.  Yet, it is also the poetry in action of superb teamwork;  from pitching to fielding, from the subtle grace of a curve ball to a double or triple play, it has the grace of a lyrical ballet perfomed on fresh mown grass instead of a dull indoor stage.<br /><br /> In a world of factoids, sound bites and trivia, \\"Diamonds Forever\\"  collects the best sayings about baseball by players, fans and others.  Kinsella's skill is knowing what to include and what to omit, and he offers up the meaning of life as well as the inner qualities of baseball.  Like Tocqueville who understood American democracy before Americans could define it, Kinsella offers an outsider's view of the magic that makes baseball the quintessential American sport.<br /> Baseball isn't automatic success.  Thomas Boswell wrote, \\"If you do everything right, you'll still lose 40 percent of your games  --  but you'll also end up in the World Series.\\"  Ted Williams said much the same, \\"Baseball is the only field of endeavour where a man can succeed three times out of ten and be considered a good performer.\\"<br /> Tired of being criticized ?  Reggie Jackson noted, \\"Fans don't boo nobodies.\\"  It's why, as Humphrey Bogart noted, \\"A hot dog at the ball park is better than steak at the Ritz.\\"  Casey Stengel of the Yankees offered the surest wisdom for a happy life, \\"The secret of managing is to keep the guys who hate you away from the guys who are undecided.\\"<br /> As broadcaster Bryant Gumbel said, \\"The other sports are just sports.  Baseball is a love.\\"  Or look at it philosophically  by Dagwood Bumstead (drawn by Chic Young), \\"Baseball, my son, is the cornerstone of civilization.\\"  Perhaps Hall of Fame catcher Roy Campanella expressed it best, \\"You gotta be a man to play baseball for a living but you gotta have a lot of little boy in you.\\"<br /> True enough.  Baseball is a game for those who have the enthusiasm and faith of little boys  - -  who know everything is possible.  It's why only Americans have walked on the moon, it's why the US is what it is today.<br /> Kinsella, like Tocqueville, understands the spirit of baseball.  It makes this book eminently worth buying.  Beg, buy or borrow it, read it, think about it and remember the best of its quotes for a perceptive insight into America and her game.<br />  As for the title of this review, it was originally said by sports writer Red Smith.  It's like America itself, as expressed by pitcher Satchel Paige, \\"Ain't no man can avoid being born average, but there ain't no man got to be common.\\"<br /> Now . . . . .  as an afterthought  - - -  why doesn't some public spirited American do the same for Canada and hockey ?expressed by pitcher Satchel Paige, \\"Ain't no man can avoid being born average, but there ain't no man got to be common.\\"<br /> Now . . . . .  as an afterthought  - - -  why doesn't some public spirited American do the same for Canada and hockey ?	2002-08-22

No one has yet uncovered the purpose for Stonehenge, which makes speculation about it a fascinating and centuries old pursuit of all possibilities.<br /> Heath isn't a pundit pursuing puzzles;  instead, he offers a brief analysis of current knowledge about this 5,000-year-old site.  His comments are to the point, obviously meant to introduce teen readers the great science and abiding mystery of Stonehenge.  For youth, it is a fair introduction that also offers enough to whet the appetite those who will become interested in further study about one of the enduring mysteries of history.<br /> Unfortunately, his apparent contempt for competent anthropologists weakens the value of his book.  Heath doesn't seem to understand the origins of urban culture date to at least Catal Huyuk and Jericho some 7,000 years ago, and probably long before that.  The great stones of Stonehenge, which began as a \\"wood\\" -henge similar to hundreds of other \\"woodhenges\\" throughout England, are rather recent compared to other great ancient works.<br /> The great puzzle of Stonehenge is not its existence, but why it was built of stone when hundreds of others were built of wood.  Of course, the reason may be as simple as understanding why the Vatican has artwork by Michaelangelo and my local church has sketches by Joe Sixpack.  Sadly, Heath overlooks this fundamental aspect as do most interpreters of the site.<br /> The value of this book is its brevity, its \\"factoid\\" format consistently offers interesting snippets of information.  The weakness is mixing an unsupported point-of-view with that brevity, it raises the question of whether unsubstantiated speculation is better than open-ended imprecision.  It's a minor quibble, certainly not a reason to pass up this book.<br /> Fifty years ago, teachers thought ideas such as \\"continental drift\\" were total fantasy.  Now, they're accepted orthodoxy.  Likewise, current speculation about the use and meaning of Stonehenge may be orthodox in 50 years (or 500 years)  --  if that happens,  it may be the result of some young student inspired by a book such as this.<br />It's a buy.  If it whets your appetite, many other books can provide a fascinating range of greater depth and diversity.  If not, you'll still learn a lot about the sophistication of the English long before they learned to write  --  but apparently could calculate complex astronomical details.tion about the use and meaning of Stonehenge may be orthodox in 50 years (or 500 years)  --  if that happens,  it may be the result of some young student inspired by a book such as this.<br />It's a buy.

Fiction ? Look at how easily the early Christians used a few words to turn December 25th., the birthday of the eastern God Mithras the bull-slayer -- which has a probably origin in Catal Huyuk some 5,000 years before the birth of Christ -- into the birthday of the Christian Saviour.<br /> Clavell speculates how clever teachers can turn a few words of prayer and faith into acceptance of a new and presumably totally opposite system of values. His story, with chilling realism, will give any intelligent reader pause about the value of rote repetition of even the most noble phrases -- such as the pledge of allegiance or that famed national anthem \\"Jose, can you see ?\\" -- compared to importance of learning the meaning of such words.<br /> For anyone who treasures basic American values, this book is a gem. The message is \\"learn the meaning\\" of the words anyone chooses to pledge; in this case, the Pledge of Allegiance, but it also applies to such documents as the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. In most nations, loyalty is based on centuries of habit, heritage and tradition; in the US, similar to Christianity which is based on the truth as revealed in The Bible, loyalty is based on written documents such as the Constitution.<br /> American society is based on the promise of written words. Think of \\"I pledge allegiance . . .\\" or \\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. . .\\" and \\"the freedom of speech or of the press . . .\\" or that \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people . . .\\" Clavell makes the point, with brief but eloquent realism, that we must understand the meaning of the words we repeat, not merely their rote cadence.<br /> It is a book for everyone interested in the basics of American freedom.ch or of the press . . .\\" or that \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people . . .\\" Clavell makes the point, with brief but eloquent realism, that we must understand the meaning of the words we repeat, not merely their rote cadence.<br /> It is a book for everyone interested in the basics of American freedom.	2002-08-11

After the body of his O'Oodham friend disappears from his truck, and the police could care less about investigating the disappearance, biologist Gray Napoleon sets out to recover it.  The more questions he asks, the more trouble he stirs up for himself, and that is the crux of the story.<br /> Napoleon is the typical Tucson twit, admirably and well portrayed by Laird, a native of Wisconsin who is now dedicated to saving Tucson from itself.  A former UCLA drop-out, Napoleon reformed and finally got a degree as a biologist which enables him to now roam the desert at leisure.  He lives in an old adobe with three-foot thick walls in the South Tucson barrio, the ultimate status symbol for the pampered politically proper ecologists of Tucson.  It gives him ample excuse to moan and groan about anyone who does anything to modernize the neighborhood  --  Give praise for the ex-hippies who are saving Tucson from itself !<br /> In his introduction, he praises Tucson author Julian Hayden (deceased since the book was published) as an inspiration  --  in the book, he says Napoleon was an early member of the radical ecologists who used to trash Hayden's equipment and cost him thousands of dollars.  If Laird appreciates the irony of this situation, he certainly doesn't indicate it in the book.  Yet, this sense of righteous twittery is pure Tucson.<br /> Enjoy a pizza ?  Once again, his response is pure Tucson.  He turns his nose up at the usual pizza chain offerings, and instead enjoys a hole-in-the-wall local restaurant.  That is SOOOOO Tucson  --  but, it leaves me wondering if he's ever heard of a chimichanga.  As the book ends, he writes of Napoleon parking his truck in a wash while he hikes into the desert  --  no one but an innocent Eastern tourist would be dumb enough to park in a wash where it could be washed away within minutes in a typical summer monsoon flash flood.  Let's just say that it's as dumb as trying to drive through a flooded underpass . . . . .<br /> All these flaws add up to pure Tucson atmosphere, which gives his story a delicious aura of authenticity.  Many detective stories are anonymous;  after reading Laird, you have a feel for the foibles and follies of Tucson  --  isn't that what life is about ?  If we weren't complex mixtures of flows, foibles, follies and fantasies, our lives would be immeasurably dull and stories such as this would have no meaning.<br /> My advice is to buy the book, read it and enjoy.

Half-a-second early, or half-a-second late, and the opportunity is lost by a car length.  Yet, McBain suggests the car driver knows the precise instant the victim will step without a glance for oncoming traffic or other hazards into the path of a car moving at 44 feet per second.<br /> Sorry, that just doesn't cut it.<br /> Granted, life is sometimes inexplicably strange.  But, the plot in this story  --  homicide by car-pedestrian accident  --  asks too much.  It could have been a great story, the delusion of two people who fear their dreams may be impossible and desperately grasp each other in the vain hope of making something come true, but McBain asks too much of the reader by using an basically implausible plot.<br /> McBain is an obviously talented writer, his 87th Precinct saga is the most celebrated police stories in the history of crime fiction.  But, it sometimes takes more talent and ability to write a good 72-page short story than a competent full-length work.<br /> It would be grossly unfair to judge his work on the basis of this book.

Yet, only one is a world famous tourist attraction  --  the Grand Canyon;  one is a World Cultural Heritage site due to its religious significance  --  Chaco Canyon;  one, deservedly, inspires great art  --  Canyon de Chelly.  None, perhaps significantly, has much association with cowboys.  Cowboys may need canyons, great canyons deserve original artists more than they need cowboys.<br /> Like the &quot;Taos Artists&quot; who created some of the best original American art, Canyon de Chelly has inspired its own &quot;school&quot; of painting and photography.  Hagerty has done a masterful job of summarizing the &quot;Canyon de Chelly School&quot; (my label, but it should become official) of art for the past century.  It's unfortunate he mostly ignores Native American art from pre-historic to modern times if the Canyon  --  but that topic may well deserve a separate analysis of its own.<br /> First of all, Canyon de Chelly is far more believable than the Grand Canyon, which is so huge and so deep that it defies belief.  It's possible to stand on the rim and see people and buildings at the bottom of Canyon de Chelly, where the greatest depth is about 1,000 feet.  The Grand Canyon is a mile deep, its vistas simply melt into infinity.<br /> The almost 100 illustrations range from the sublime (Ansel Adams 1941 photo of White House Ruin) to the silly (Woody Gwyn's 1994 painting of the parking lot next to Antelope House ruin).  If the most beautiful thing we can experience is the sense of the mysterious, as Albert Einstein once described the true source of all art and science, then these artists did capture the essence of Canyon de Chelly (the name is adapted from the Navajo &quot;tse&quot;  --  meaning rock, which is pronounced &quot;shay&quot;).<br /> One great advantage is the inclusion of recent artwork, showing how the non-Navajo perception of the Canyon has changed.  Art a century ago featured Navajos in the Canyon  --  just as Taos artists emphasized people;  today, Canyon paintings are mostly empty landscapes, as though today's Navajos are an oddity .  Navajo artists, of course, still include people  --  but then, the Canyon is their home and not a distant mystery.<br /> Many artists, in Hagerty's words, see &quot;Canyon de Chelly as solid and eternal, a place of solace and escape from pressures of modern American culture.&quot;  Personally, I think of it as a place of living people, and the beauty which surrounds their lives.  Chaco Canyon is the vast empty ruined cathedral from people who have vanished into the mists of time;  the Grand Canyon is the window into eternity.<br /> Each locale generates a unique artistic depiction, which really hinges on living in the place, or it fades from artistic consciousness.  Be that as it may, and Hagerty doesn't delve into such esoteric speculation; he does offer an informed, relevant, intelligent and ongoing look at a truly original element of American art.<br /> The Taos school seems frozen in time even though gigantic in its own legends, the &quot;Canyon de Chelly School&quot; is continually evolving and experimenting with new forms.  Taos artist Barbara Zaring is interesting but unreal in her 1980s paintings;  Phoenix artist Ed Mell, despite his overlooking the Navajo inhabitants of the Canyon, offers a fresh 1990s view.<br /> There is no &quot;best&quot; portrayal of the Canyon  --  though my favorite is Adams 1941 photo  --  and Hagerty doesn't imply that one exists.  He simply and eloquently offers an excellent overview, giving artists, patrons, collectors and viewers alike an intelligent insight into a very original and significant element of the American art scene.<br /> Suffice to say, no serious collection of American art should be without a portrait of Canyon de Chelly.  Hagerty provides a wonderful introductory service, which makes his book perfect for all artists, viewers and people with an interest in the beautyof America.of America.	2002-07-25

George Washington was wrong.<br /> That is Kaplan's advice.  Washington, in his farewell address to the nation, advised against foreign entanglements.  Kaplan thinks America should intervene with the full force of its military might to overthrow not-so-nice foreign leaders.  The choice is bombs or ballots.  If the ballot count is as rigged as Florida's famous flawed hanging chad count in 2000, then get set for some Made-in-the-USA bombs.<br /> Bomb 'em back to the stone age.  Kill 'em all, let God sort them out.  Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.  The conservative slogans are widely and well known.  The question is whether they are efficacious or not.  Let's look at it from another angle.<br />  Why are people nice ?<br /> Simply, niceness works.  From the time of the classic \\"Prisoner's Dilemma' to modern research at Emory University in Atlanta, cooperation has definite advantages over competition.  Nonetheless, all social systems need laws to prevent cheating.  These same  studies have found that 20 to 30 percent of people need at least a threat of punishment to be honest.  That, in brief, is the nub of the issue that Kaplan addresses.<br /> Recently, Todd Purdum wrote in The New York Times about the current foreign policy debate in Washington, \\"These are deep, philosophical differences between two very different views of America in the world.  One is a traditional conservative view; the other is a radical break with 55 years of a bipartisan tradition that sought international agreements and regimes of benefit to us.\\"<br /> Kaplan advocates the \\"radical break,\\" and his book offers some persuasive reasons.  He's absolutely right when it comes to dealing with the 20 percent who need a \\"big stick\\" to prevent cheating;  sadly, he ignores the 80 percent of good folks who don't need threats or bullying to be honorable.<br /> In the past, we embraced good folks and tended to ignore bad guys in the hope they would reform.  As often as not, we were eventually confronted by bad guys who preferred war to our values.  Kaplan approves of the British way of crushing such villains, but he forgets the major British effort wasn't gunboats, it was based on the \\"nation building\\" which American conservatives reject.<br /> One of Kaplan's heroes is Sir Winston Churchill, justifiably so.  But he seems unable to understand the role of Neville Chamberlain, who signed the Munich agreement giving the Sudetenland to Germany, returned with his \\"Peace in our time\\" pledge and then launched a major re-armament program.  Chamberlain led Britain into World War II to stop Hitler, more than two years before the US became involved.  Churchill didn't succeed Chamberlain until after the collapse of Belgium and France created a disaster for British forces fighting on the continent, when Chamberlain was literally months away from death.<br /> Obviously, it's very reasonable to oppose Kaplan's thesis.  \\"Warrior Politics\\" is worth reading as an articulate advocacy of one type of foreign policy.  He advocates the use of deceit and outright lies for the public good, citing Machiavelli and Sun-Tzu;  but doesn't answer whether America in the long run is better off being a nation of liars rather than one of truth, honesty, honor and decency.<br /> Some people believe in using lies, and think only fools trust the honor of others.  Granted, deceit is sometimes effective on a short-term basis.  But, in the long term  --  as shown by the worldwide \\"drift\\" toward democracy  --  truth, honesty, honor and decency do have lasting values.  It is decency that made America great, not an ability to lie and bully others.<br /> This book is a handy template for every decision-maker;  and, based on their own integrity and moral values, people will decide whether to follow its advice or take it as a warning of the perils of short-sighted policies.y confronted by bad guys who preferred war to our values.

Visit the ruins of an English castle, or a coastal monastery destroyed by Vikings, and the origins and fate are readily available.  At Chaco, the Great Houses built from about 850 AD to 11 AD were the highest stone structures built in the Americas until at least the 18th century.<br /> For Navajos and New Agers, like the English of 850 AD when called on to explain Roman ruins, the structures were built by gods.  The reality is more prosaic, Chaco was built by the ancestors of today's pueblo Indians.  The mystery is \\"Why ?\\"<br /> The Chaco Handbook doesn't attempt to solve the mystery.  Instead, it provides a concise handbook of Chacoan studies, illustrated with more than 100 maps, drawings and photos, plus definitions of 250 of the common terms relating to more than a century of exploration and investigations.  On the basis of my personal visits beginning in the 1960s, it is the best single volume introduction available to explain Chaco.<br /> It's up-to-date, covering some of the latest original and provocative work by longtime professionals such as Thomas Windes and Steve Lekson.  It also mildly debunks the sensationalism of Christy Turner who caused a brief flurry of revulsion with his suggestion it was an ancient pueblo cannibalism center.<br /> It's a handy reference for anyone who has visited, an invaluable resource for anyone who plans to visit and a perfect introduction even for those unable to visit.  Instead of the usual detailed archaeological minutiae, \\"The Chaco Handbook\\" is ideal for average readers.  Written by two consummate experts with decades of professional experience, it is an excellent introduction to visiting and thinking about Chaco.<br /> After reading this book, dozens of other books are available which range from professional reports and analysis of excavated sites to esoteric speculation that varies from Aztec warlords to visitors from outer space.  Once again, based on personal experience, this book is the next best thing to living there for several months.<br /> Care for some speculation ?  Chaco was abandoned after 1100 AD when the Southwest was hit by a decades-long drought;  I've studied quality reports of Chaco groundwater which is laced with high levels of natural pollution that can cause mental retardation.  The decline roughly coincides with the introduction of the Kachina religion, still a vital part of Zuni and Hopi societies  --  two good reasons to start over someplace else.<br /> When we consider why people do things  --  such as build Chaco in the first place, or abandon it after 250 years  --  we're looking at some fundamental ideas about the origins and fate of societies.  Why migrate to Chaco and build Great Houses ?  Look at it this way  --  Why should Europeans migrate to America and build a Great Society ?  Chaco is a metaphor for our world.<br /> This is the fun of studying and speculating about Chaco, a rich and materialistic society that offered far more than a marginal or subsistence life.  The Chaco Phenomenon was a vast construction project lasting hundreds of years, with a profound impact on the regional ecology.  It leaves the enduring question, \\"What inspired these Pueblo Ancestors to such greatness ?\\"<br /> Granted, this book doesn't delve into such idle and sometimes amusing speculation.  But, it offers a concise and comprehensive background for those who ponder such issues, and I recommend it as the best introduction available.

The central theme is the systematic looting of Native American sites on behalf of Anglos who are driven by greed for ancient artifacts.  In this story, the greed has two faces;  one is the monetary reward of finding and selling ancient artifacts for often vast sums of money, and the other is the greed for scholarly fame that is the reward for discovering new and sometimes shocking facts about Native Americans.<br /> Would scholars be so crude ?  Well, think of Regents Professor Christie G. Turner of Arizona State University who \\"proved\\" the ancestors of the Hopis and Zunis and other pueblo tribes were cannibals.  It sure got him a lot of fame and attention.<br /> Would pot hunters be so violent ?  Having been trained as a site steward, a volunteer who checks known sites to deter looting, we were warned never to directly challenge anyone engaged in looting a site.<br /> Put the two elements together, and you have the basis of the very plausible plot in this story.  Then add the detective work of two Navajo Nation police officers, whose work often seems to be protecting the Navajos from the crimes of non-Navajos, and the result is a good story.  Hillerman writes well, with a genuine affection for The People, but even at his best he's still an outsider looking at the intricacies of Navajo culture.<br /> Who am I to judge Hillerman's portrayal of the Navajos ?  Well, in my dealings with Navajo police officers, I found some to be much more introspective and analytical of differences between their culture and the outside world than Hillerman indicates.  He also seems oblivious to the sharp and delightful Navajo sense of humor, perhaps because it is more subtle than the usual slapstick style of Anglo-American humor.  He cites various clans, but doesn't seem to understand the sharp differences that sometimes exist among clans.<br /> So, why read Hillerman ?<br /> He's very worth reading because he offers a fine introduction to the People, and he is greatly honored among the Navajos for that reason.  Some quibble over the authenticity of his facts  - - -  but there are equally vehement debates over the quality of fry bread from different parts of the Rez.<br /> The fact is that Hillerman is a good writer.  He offers a valued insight into Native American culture, which is an \\"Mulligan stew\\" of different beliefs, attitudes, values and opinions.  Want a simple example of a major difference ?<br /> In Anglo society, legal issues are resolved in the courts on the basis of confrontational arguments which produce a clear winner and loser  --  called \\"Guilty or Innocent\\"  --  a system based on jousting between champions chosen to represent the two sides in a dispute.  In Navajo culture, the principle of Ke'e reflects a desire for consensus that seeks a harmonious resolution for all sides in a dispute.  In addition to a legal system based on traditional Anglo law, the Navajos also have \\"Peacemaker\\" courts based on traditional Navajo values of consensus instead of confrontation.<br /> Hillerman doesn't examine such subtleties;  his stories are based on Anglo values of guilt and innocence, good and bad, truth and falsehood, right and wrong.  A traditional Navajo, writing a similar book, would sympathize with the perpetrator as well as victim, as in the saying about never judging a person until you have walked a mile in their moccasins.<br /> Yet, until such books are written  --  think of a detective novel which ends in consensus instead of a clear designation of evil  --  Hillerman will continue to rank among the best of Anglo views of Native American culture.  Or, in terms of oriental culture, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.<br /> Hillerman has taken a thousand steps in introducing outsiders to Native American culture  --  but, it's worth remembering his stories are only a few steps in a long journey.thousand steps in introducing outsiders to Native American culture  --  but, it's worth remembering his stories are only a few steps in a long journey.	2002-07-19

He is masterful in depicting the pretentious twittery of Santa Fe, mostly an Anglo veneer over the Spanish poverty which existed until the Santa Fe - Taos axis of a \\"friendly, familiar, foreign and close\\" culture was discovered by Anglo artists and wealthy tourists after the arrival of the Santa Fe railway in the 1880s.<br /> His story also covers the Hopi Rez, and briefly the Tucson area  --  I've lived in this region for 35 years.  His descriptions of people and placing are authentic, he offers a charming but unvarnished authenticity.  Strangely, he keeps referring to Interstate highways as \\"Route 40\\" instead of the more familiar \\"I-40\\"  --  but, that's a minor quibble.  He avoids the \\"Drunktown\\" description of Gallup, the self-proclaimed \\"Indian Capital of the World,\\" calling it the \\"Degradation Capital of the Indian World\\" which is well-deserved.<br /> But the emphasis is solving a murder, linked to the theft of sacred Indian icons, by an Anglo law enforcement officer.  There are plenty of villains, including an archaeologist, a conniving Spanish woman, a fading member of Santa Fe's cultural elite, a former Bureau of Indian Affairs teacher and an alcoholic Hopi youth.  In this plot, he nicely sums up the inter-twined villainy that produces the trade in looted archaeological and religious gems.<br /> In this case, it was Hopi religious items.  He could just as easily have written about the theft of ancient Spanish \\"santos\\" from abandoned churches;  it's not just thousand-year-old items that form this lucrative trade, it's almost anything left unguarded in the vastness of the mostly empty New Mexico rural landscape.  There is a bitter truth to the saying that Southwestern ranchers \\"would steal a hot stove, then come back for the smoke.\\"  Santos ?  I personally know of an entire abandoned church that was stolen.<br /> Page's villains are the usual range of exploiters and opportunists, and he deals in a straight forward fashion with theft and repatriation of Native American artifacts without getting bogged down in contentious debates or moralizing.  It's a real issue, as sensitive to Native Americans as would be the case of a Catholic priest stealing holy objects from Vatican altars to finance his weaknesses and sins.<br /> How real is it ?  How about a police officer who alledgedly killed a Native American jewelry buyer and used the proceeds to open a business ?  Or an archaeologist \\"given\\" a small fortune in ancient pots from various digs ?  Proof ?  Sometimes, it's almost impossible.<br /> Page's strong point is that he writes from an Anglo point of view, a contrast to Oklahoma native Tony Hillerman who tries to portray Navajo police officers on a personal basis.  Hillerman is good, sometimes very good;  but, he is loved and hated by Navajos  --  loved for the positive attention he brings to the Navajo Nation, hated for his sometimes shallow portrayals of The People.<br /> Some writers are reasonably good at portraying Navajo habits and attitudes;  generally speaking, Hillerman doesn't capture some of the more subtle nuances of Navajo humor, opinions and attitudes.  Page avoids this weakness with a focus on Anglo characters  --  though I take strong issue with his near-worshipful depiction of a dedicated FBI agent  (I suppose there must be some somewhere).<br /> All in all, it's an interesting and well-presented book.  It deals with a sensitive issue in a realistic manner and neatly wraps up a plausible plot;  for Hillerman's treatment of the same topic, read \\"Talking God\\" or \\"A Thief of Time.\\"\\"Talking God\\" or \\"A Thief of Time.\\"	2002-07-18

But, they also have a sense of responsibility for each other;  Hanna Schmitz insists that Michael Berg apply himself to his schoolwork, in return, he reads a variety of books to her (her shortcoming is illiteracy).<br /> Now, think of this in terms of some recently failed businesses;  where the chief executive is obsessed with showing profits or making his company the dominant one in its field.  So, the books are cooked to show desirable results  --  and, the employees who must \\"go along to get along.\\"<br /> Hanna's story is of an illiterate peasant girl swept into the Nazi SS during the war, ending the war guarding some concentration camp inmates who die brutally.  She had many opportunities to spare them, but refused on the grounds of loyalty to what she saw as duty rather than an ethical issue of humanity by doing what was right.  Think of her in terms of employees of companies who remain silent in the face of wrong doing rather than \\"betray\\" a greater loyalty to the business.<br /> In brief, it's a parable about the price of doing right in contrast to the expediency of \\"going along to get along.\\"  Hanna is eventually brought to trial for her wartime actions and sent to prison;  Michael becomes a lawyer, with a career that is haunted by Hanna and their relationship.  Both used each other, and as a result both hurt each other.<br /> Sound familiar ?  Of course, it's the age-old story of the consequences of taking ethical shortcuts for personal profit or pleasure.  How many Europeans made similar choices in World War II ?  How many business executives made similar choices in recent years to enhance their reputations or profit ?<br /> \\"Ah, you want to understand why people can do such terrible things,\\" a motorist asks Michael when he at last decides to visit a concentration camp to try to understand what Hanna did during the war.  Hanna's whole life was a lie, her complicity with evil had a devastating impact on others  --  not because she was inherently bad  --  but because of her tendency of \\"going along to get along\\" rather than facing any risk or hardship.<br /> Even after her conviction, Hanna had \\"A proud, wounded, lost, and infinitely tired look.  A look that wished to see nothing and no one.\\"  Think of contemporary executives who destroy their companies by endorsing expediency rather than ethics, and proudly refuse to say as much as \\"I'm sorry\\" for the harm they cause.<br /> Schlink used a horrific example to make his point;  he is a law professor, skilled in dealing with the aftermath of cases where expediency overrules ethics and morals.  But, to a much lesser degree, it is a choice we all face  --  using an expedient \\"white lie\\" rather than upset a friend or colleague with some honest advice.<br /> Do we ever escape the consequences of such actions ?<br /> A few sentences from the end of his parable, Schlink writes: \\"The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on the top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as a matter that has been fully formed an pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive.\\"<br /> Think of it the next time you tell a white lie, or decide \\"going along to get along\\" is better than being honest to yourself and others.lar choices in recent years to enhance their reputations or profit ?<br /> \\"Ah, you want to understand why people can do such terrible things,\\" a motorist asks Michael when he at last decides to visit a concentration camp to try to understand what Hanna did during the war.

He attributes military success to the inherent individualism of a free society;  he ignores the fundamental element of a free society, the ability of people to trust each other without the need for police and other regulatory enforcers.<br /> It's worth reading, nonetheless.<br /> Basically, he argues that individualism, rationalism and personal initiative of a free people are the keys to European success.  It's an absolutely valid thesis;  unfortunately, he didn't include the equally vital discipline, personal responsibility and willing obedience.  Yet,  it's easy enough to overlook his flaws and focus on his main theme that specific cultural traits make the vital difference.<br /> Basically, Hanson argues that European individualism has its roots in classical Greek democracy.  His weakness is not knowing why such democracy arose in Greece, just as a similar fierce democracy arose in Scandinavia.  Not knowing \\"why\\" matters, but it doesn't take away from his basic emphasis on personal freedom and responsibility.<br /> Actually, two key factors explain European success.  First is the willing acceptance of discipline needed for a united cause;  second is the personal initiative to come up with aa good alternative if the first element fails.  These principles apply to all elements of a free society.  Great warrior societies perish, great commercial societies vanish, and great religions die.  Enduring societies produce guns, butter and prayers.<br /> Freedom works, because people with free choice volunteer to vigorously defend their societies.  People who are free to choose achieve far more than those who are coerced or drafted.  This applies to war as well as economics, religion, politics, the arts and justice.  Hanson limits his examples to war, which is the great weakness of his book.<br /> Strangely enough, Hanson laments \\". . .  some key ingredients of traditional Western warfare appear to be all but gone.  Mercenary armies in America and Europe are the norm.\\"  It's an odd comment on today's voluntary, well-paid and highly professional US military, compared to the conscription of draftees in the past.<br /> However, the fundamental basis of a free society is trust.  It applies to business, which is why Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Halliburton are such distressing symbols of greed over honesty.  In analyzing the Tet Offensive of 1968, Hanson blames \\"liberals\\" for the American loss of Vietnam.  He doesn't seem to understand that it was the public loss of trust in the military and political leadership of the 1960s that brought defeat.  In 1944, the Battle of the Bulge was a similarly rude shock for Western society which expected the war to be over before Christmas  - - -  but, in those days politicians and generals were trusted.<br /> Ignoring such elements of a free society constitute major flaws in this book.  But, it doesn't undermine the basic premise that certain basic cultural values give Western society an unprecedented military and economic advantage for the past several hundred years.  Ours is a confrontational society based on competition in business, an adversarial legal system, a win-lose political debate rather than compromise and mediation, and a system of checks and balance on the use of political and economic authority.<br /> Those qualities made Western society into the world's superpower.  It's time to look at 5,000 years of history to examine qualities that created earlier dominance in war, economics or religion.  We tend to think of Western society as the pinnacle of material and spiritual achievement,  as all previous societies thought of their accomplishments.  Surely one lesson of history is that the qualities which create success are not those which sustain it.<br /> Hanson is well worth reading for his one-note theory of modern power  --  he says it is the Western knack for killing.  It is much more.  There is a whole quilt of qualities, not merely one little blood-soaked patchwork piece.  He offers a nice first step in understanding the worldwide acceptance of current European values  --  but, he ignores many other elements that create the whole patchwork quilt.<br /> The greatest danger to our freedom comes from absolutist dogma such as Hanson's assertion, \\"Western civilization has given mankind the only economic system that works . . . . . \\"  Egypt under the Pharaohs was the longest surviving and wealthiest society of its era  --  which collapsed because it could not accept change.  Our society is scarcely the only one that works  --  though it may well be the best for modern times.  Hanson needs to look beyond his own cloistered little ivory tower to see the beauty of other societies.<br /> Fortunately, a free society is a process of continual change.  Unlike past nations, which enshrined a conservative heritage of tradition rather than accept change, Western society will likely continue to evolve to meet and match ever-changing conditions.  Hanson aptly shows one reason why.  But, there are many more reasons it is so.one-note theory of modern power  --  he says it is the Western knack for killing.  It is much more.

If he's as dumb as you suspect, tell him it really flatters his personality;  if he's smart, you're taking our chances in using any insults  --  deserved or naught.  It may show that you are a dunderwhelp ?  --  that's a detestable numbskull.  Or perhaps you could call him a peniculas ?  Look that up in your Latin dictionary.<br /> A favorite of mine is &quot;snollygoster&quot;  --  that's an unprincipled politician.  Nah, George Bush wouldn't be that, would he ?  Of course not.  Let's just say he's an empleomaniac entheomaniac  --  relax, he won't know what it means until he can find a dictionary.  (Even then he might look it up as &quot;impleomaniac.&quot;)  An emploeomaniac is a person who is excessively eager to hold public office.  An entheimaniac is someone who is literally insane about religion.<br /> Or would you just prefer to call me a &quot;philodox&quot; ?  It applies to those who writes opinionated reviews.<br /> It's a fun book.  Granted, you're not likely to memorize a couple of dozen of these words and drop them into casual conversation.

If you want to be truly insulting, and who doesn't have at least a few friends who need to be truly insulted, it's why you need the book<br /> Naffin.  Now, there's a nice gentle-sounding term.  Almost affectionate.  It describes a person who is almost an idiot.  Ever meet a shotclog ?  That's a nasty person who is tolerated because he's buying all the drinks.

You've all heard about &quot;impeccable&quot; as praise ?  How about &quot;peccable&quot; ?  Yes, it's a real world, it means liable to sin.<br /> Once, many years ago, I knew a publisher whose favorite term was &quot;cretin.&quot;  Unfortunately, in his limited acumen, he was never able to come up with a new word and he soon bored everyone with his snoutband attitude.<br /> Well, if nothing else, you may conclude that I'm a sophomaniac.

US	49694975	R2THB59R70M9ZE	0771099843	785214844	Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (New Canadian Library)	Books	5	22	25	N	Y	An endearing portrait of Oriliia  --  my home town	Perhaps the finest comment about Stephen Leacock in the last half century is that &quot;he is a<br />  Will Rogers for the 90's.&quot;<br />  Rogers, of course, is one of the most beloved of American humorists -- he was killed in<br />  1935 when his plane crashed near Point Barrow, Alaska. Leacock died on March 28, 1944.<br />  Like Rogers, he had been Canada's favorite humorist for decades.<br />  Sunshine Sketches is about Orillia, Ontario, Canada, where Leacock had his summer home<br />  on Brewery Bay (he once wrote, &quot;I have known that name, the old Brewery Bay, to make<br />  people feel thirsty by correspondence as far away as Nevada.&quot;) His home is now maintained<br />  as a historic site by the town of Orillia.  I lived there for almost 30 years, and the people of Orillia are still much the same as Leacock portrayed them in 1912.<br />  These stories about various personalities in town were printed in the local newspaper in the<br />  1910 - 1912 era, before being compiled into this book which established Leacock's literary<br />  fame. The people portrayed really lived, though some are composites; the events are of a<br />  kindly humorist looking at the foibles of small town life. Once they came out in book form<br />  and soared to national popularity, everyone in town figured the rest of the country was<br />  laughing at them because of Leacock's book and he was royally hated in Orillia to the end<br />  of his life.<br />  Gradually, and this took decades, Orillians came to recognize that genius had walked<br />  amongst them for several decades. (It's hard to recognize genius when your own ego is so<br />  inflated.) Orillia now awards the annual &quot;Leacock Medal for Humor&quot; -- Canada's top literary<br />  prize for the best book of humour for the preceding year.<br />  Leacock died when I was six, but I did know his son, who still lived in town. I delivered<br />  papers to the editor of the &quot;Newspacket,&quot; Leacock's name for the Orillia Packet and Times<br />  (where I worked) and the rival Newsletter. The Packet had the same editor in the 1940's as<br />  when Leacock wrote about him in 1910.<br />  But the book is more than Orillia; it is a wonderfully kind and humorous description of life in<br />  many small towns. The American artist Norman Rockwell painted the same kinds of scenes;<br />  it is the type of idyllic urban life so many of us keep longing to find again in our hectic<br />  urban world.<br />  Leacock realized the book was universal in its description of small towns, and in the preface<br />  he wrote &quot;Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty of<br />  them. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square<br />  streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels, and everywhere the<br />  sunshine of the land of hope.&quot;<br />  True enough, which gives this book continuing appeal nearly a century after it was written.<br />  All great writing is about topics you know, and as a longtime resident Leacock knew Orillia<br />  well. As for Leacock himself, he wrote, &quot;I was born at Swanmoor, Hants., England, on Dec.<br />  30, 1869. I am not aware that there was any particular conjunction of the planets at the<br />  time, but should think it extremely likely.&quot;<br />  He says of his education, &quot;I survived until I took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in<br />  1903. The meaning of this degree is that the recipient of instruction is examined for the last<br />  time in his life, and is pronounced completely full. After this, no new ideas can be imparted<br />  to him.&quot;<br />  In reviewing Charles Dickens' works in 1934, Leacock wrote what could well be his own<br />  epitaph: &quot;Transitory popularity is not proof of genius. But permanent popularity is.&quot; The fact<br />  his writings are still current illustrates the nature of his writing.<br />  In contrast to the sometimes sardonic humor of modern times, Sunshine Sketches reflects<br />  Leacock's idea that &quot;the essence of humor is human kindness.&quot; Or, in the same vein, &quot;Humor<br />  may be defined as the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life, and the artistic<br />  expression thereof.&quot;<br />  Granted, this book is not what he recognized to have widespread appeal to modern readers.<br />  In his own words, &quot;There are only two subjects that appeal nowadays to the general public,<br />  murder and sex; and, for people of culture, sex-murder.&quot; Yet, anyone reading this will<br />  remember scenes from it for much longer than anything from a murder mystery.<br />  In today's world, where newspapers almost daily track Prime Minister Tony Blair's dash to<br />  the political right, Leacock wrote, &quot;Socialism won't work except in Heaven where they don't<br />  need it and in Hell where they already have it.&quot;<br />  He described his own home as follows, &quot;I have a large country house -- a sort of farm<br />  which I carry on as a hobby . . . . Ten years ago the deficit on my farm was about a<br />  hundred dollars; but by well-designed capital expenditure and by greater attention to<br />  details, I have got it into the thousands.&quot; Sounds familiar to today's farm policies ?<br />  It's what I mean by this being a timeless work.<br />  Leacock himself noted, when talking about good literature, &quot;Personally, I would sooner have<br />  written 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica'.&quot; This is his<br />  'Alice' and it well deserves to be favorably compared to Lewis Carroll's work.<br />  By all measures, it is still the finest Canadian book ever written.He says of his education, &quot;I survived until I took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in<BR>                    1903.

Even in the US, some women still carry this burden inflicted by jealous husbands or boyfriends.  This book is a poignant reminder that it should not be so, and every woman deserves to be trusted.<br /> For Anetta, trousers symbolized freedom and independence.  Suffice to say, in her Sicilian world, she never got to wear them;  but, she grew up surrounded by lascivious relatives whose chronic suspicion and hypocrisy turned her life into a nightmare.  Trousers were a sin, but the uncle who slid his hand up her skirt when she was 10 was an embarrassment never to be countered or spoken about.<br /> In our society, we know it as Victorian morality.  Boys and men were expected \\"to sow their wild oats,\\" but the girls with whom they had their fun were beneath the notice of polite company.  It's the ultimate repression for women;  nothing they say is believable, everything they say is grounds for suspicion, doubt and recrimination.<br /> Cardella does not portray a happy society;  instead, she tells how the perennial fear  of what a girl might do if left unguarded generates suspicion, which drives at least some to the sins they've of which they are accused, generating further suspicion and fear.  Jealousy is a self-perpetuating bitter fear that destroys those who succumb to its fever; it harms everyone it touches.<br /> The tragedy is that it can be triggered by a girl's laugh, prompting suspicions of \\"Why is she happy and I'm not ?\\" or the unspoken fear \\"Why does he make her happy and not me ?\\"  The fact women have a right to be happy, without generating irrational male fears,  generated a storm of controversy in Italy.  In response, Cardella was banned from her hometown because of this book.<br />  In Europe, where women are often still treated as objects of desire instead of people capable of having their own desires, it has sold two million copies.  Obviously, it's found a sympathetic audience among people who need this reminder of the injustices sometimes inflicted upon half of the population.<br /> In North America, it's a vivid reminder of chauvinist attitudes that until the so-called \\"sexual revolution\\" were used to intimidate and oppress women.  There are still far too many obstacles which limit opportunities for women, but this brief book is a fascinating reminder of just how far along the road to equality we've come in 50 years.<br /> Women make up at least 50 percent of the potential talent of modern society;  this story of the iron shackles of prejudice, suspicion and jealousy hammered onto women in many societies helps explain why some regions are perpetually poor.  It's hardly an accident that Annetta's most liberated friend is the daughter of an engineer from northern Italy;  by the same token, before the book ends, she points out that wealth doesn't assure virtue or compassion.<br /> Those are personal qualities rather than the narrow morals imposed by jealousy or suspicion.  Her book is a testament to individual qualities, a contrast to the artificial and shallow virtues professed by people who become hypocritical in their zealous jealousy.  She celebrates individual qualities, not the moral hypocrisy of warped righteousness.onse, Cardella was banned from her hometown because of this book.<br />        In Europe, where women are often still treated as objects of desire instead of people capable of having their own desires, it has sold two million copies.

The pretentious twaddle by Lawrence Clark Powell is typical Tucson,  people who manage to find fault with everything.<br /> First, the pictures.  Photography was part of my job for years, and I have visited probably half of the places included in this book.  For example, consider the picture of White House Ruin in Canyon de Chelly, taken in 1942.  I've taken dozens of photos of it, and hiked every foot in the vicinity.  Nothing of mine comes close to the mastery of Adams beautiful black-and-white photograph.  I suspect that even if I copied his picture as precisely as possible, mine would still look dull in comparison to his artistry.<br /> Adams' mastery of the camera and the art of making prints is such that even in black-and-white, his pictures sparkle with a luminosity that puts color to shame.  In recent years newspapers have wasted a great effort on color pictures.  Adams' work shows how superior the old black-and-white photos could be in comparison to modern newspaper color.  Any photo editor would weep to have such quality today.  More's the pity the newspapers do not emphasize quality instead of glitzy novelty.<br /> It's more than a book about the Southwest;  it's a book about how to see nature and the world around us.  Adams had an eye for natural beauty.  I've no doubt he could find beauty and art even in a junk yard.  He knew what to include in a picture, and how much to leave out, and the precise moment when it all came together.  His pictures of cacti, aspens, rocks and adobe structures will cause anyone to look again and more closely at their surroundings, to appreciate the beauty of detail in a grander setting.<br /> Sadly, the words fall far short of the pictures.  Fifty years ago, Joseph Wood Krutch wrote in praise of the Southwest, &quot;the combination of brilliant sun and high, thin, dry air with a seemingly limitless expanse of sky and earth [that] my first reaction was delighted amusement.  How far the ribbon of road beckoned ahead!  How endlessly much there seemed to be of the majestically rolling expanse of bare earth dotted with sagebrush!&quot;<br /> Such beauty still exists in the Southwest, even today.  I have often driven such roads.<br /> In contrast,  Powell is an old grouch.  The only things he finds to praise are his own presence and ruined adobes.  He seeks the negatives, such as Gallup, New Mexico, where &quot;the Indian may be seen in the stages of disintegration  --  drinking, fighting, staggering and falling to the sidewalk and gutter.  Here is the place to read 'Laughing Boy,' LaFarge's lament for a people debauched by an alien race.&quot;<br /> Powell ignores the fact Gallup has established one of the nation's outstanding alcohol rehabilitation programs, far superior to anything in Tucson.  His ugly words are a contrast to the beauty of Adams' photographs.<br /> It doesn't matter.  Buy the book for the photographs, they are worth it.  Ignore Powell's whiney complaints.  You'll get a gem in terms of wonderful pictures, and for laugh's you'll see Tucsonian political correctness run amok.hort of the pictures.

US	49694975	RH1ZEUJIA2H3V	0393041832	967454060	The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder	Books	5	61	68	N	Y	Why elect a doofus as president	In 1972, according to J. H. Hatfield in his book 'Fortunate Son,' the 26-year-old George Bush was arrested for possession of cocaine in Houston;  as Hatfield pointed out, a friendly judge erased the arrest and conviction from the public record.<br /> True or false ?  Take your pick.<br /> At best, it's an example of how a boozing prodigal son can turn his life around.  He's not the only one.  To cite a minor example, after he underwent a religious awakening similar to Bush, Navajo Nation President Kelsey Begaye went from an alcohol-clouded life on Skid Row in Los Angeles to Speaker of the Navajo Nation Council and then president of the Navajo Nation.<br /> Naturally, Bush gets somewhat upset when anyone cites the cocaine charge.  This book cites an interview with Seth Mnookin of the magazine Brill's Content in which Bush said Hatfield was condemned &quot;. . . . for writing the story.&quot;  He didn't criticize Hatfield for getting the story wrong, for making it up, for not checking facts or for obvious malice  --  he criticized him &quot;. . . . for writing the story.&quot;<br /> If nothing else, it shows Bush's sloppiness in his use of language.  It is the major complaint against Bush, that he has an undisciplined sloppy approach to everything he does.  After the attack on the World Trade Center, he announced a &quot;crusade&quot; against the Arabs  --  using the one word, crusade, that is certain to stiffen Arab resistance.  When he went to the Far East, he promised to look the Asian leaders directly in the eye  --  using the precise image that is a challenge to a confrontation.<br /> So, why was Bush elected ?  After eight years of poll-driven Clinton decisions, the public didn't want a cerebral activist president.  Bush was the only alternative, and in the fall of 2000 his sloppiness seemed charming and harmless.  Yet, in times of crisis and tough decisions, this sloppiness causes trouble.<br /> As this book points out, on page after page, Bush is clearly a real-life Forrest Gump  elevated far beyond the realm of fuzzy warm feelings.  In the movie, Gump was always a slightly befuddled observer at great events;  in real life, consistently as this book points out, Bush is a tongue-tied fumbler at the heart of great events.  It's not nearly as heart-warming as a typical American movie with its syrupy happy ending.<br /> Bush's other fault, as the book makes clear, is his fundamentalist religious faith that reflects a cold righteousness that chills anyone who fails to accept his tenets.  We are now in a war against terrorism, a war in which we need Christians, Jews and Muslims to join an ecumenical campaign against fundamentalist radicals who exploit religion for their own ends.<br /> In 1775, Samuel Johnson noted &quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&quot;  Today, based on the actions of religious extremists  --  from people who blow up abortion clinics to those who fly aircraft into buildings  --  Johnson would surely say &quot;Religion is the last refuge of scoundrels.&quot;<br /> Yet, the book isn't really an attack on Bush.  The underlying question is whether our modern media, with its emphasis on amusing but meaningless trivia, makes it impossible for a serious candidate to succeed in politics.<br /> This isn't a book about the last election, it's really about the next election.  The Bush record, set out in verbatim detail, raises serious questions about a political system that allows a doofus such as Bush to be elected.  Yet, it's only half the issue.  Miller needs to write a similar book about Al Gore, who wasn't a beacon of terminological exactitude and visionary enlightenment.<br /> In Canada, Prime Minister Jean Chretien draws criticism similar to Bush.  In Great Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair is facing similar scrutiny.  Does the triviality of modern news reporting create a crisis of competent leadership  --  or are other fundamental faults undermining the democratic idea?  This book is an essential introduction to that debate.<br /> Now, let the opinions rage.  Out of it comes a stronger society.sential introduction to that debate.<br /> Now, let the opinions rage.

His conclusion doomed the continuing success of his book, he defined the mind of the fanatic rather than defending the ideology of politics.<br /> The book was first published in 1951, at the height of the McCarthy witch hunts.  Instead of attacking communism, Hoffer identified fanatics as guilt-ridden hitch-hikers who thumb a ride on any ideology from Christianity to communism.  The fault, according to Hoffer, was the mind of the fanatic who needs a Stalin or a Hitler or a Christ or a bin Laden to worship and die for.  His description of a fanatic fitted Sen. Barry Goldwater's assertion that &quot;extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.&quot; It applies to Jerry Falwell with the same rigor as he would define bin Laden today.<br /> Consider some of Hoffer's assertions:<br /> &quot;Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute for the lost faith in ourselves.<br /> &quot;The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self, the more ready he is to claim all excellence for his nation, his religion, his race or his holy cause.<br /> &quot;A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding.  When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people's business.<br /> &quot;This minding of other's people's business expresses itself in gossip, snooping and meddling, and also in feverish interest in communal, national and racial affairs.  In running away from ourselves we either fall on our neighbor's shoulder or fly at his throat.&quot;<br /> Now tell me, does this sound like bin Laden and/or Falwell (plus a wide number of other zealots you may wish to name):<br /> &quot;The burning conviction that we have a holy duty toward others is often a way of attaching our drowning selves to a passing raft.  What looks like giving a hand is often a holding on for dear life.  Take away our holy duties and you leave our lives puny and meaningless.  There is no doubt that in exchanging a self-centered for a selfless life we gain enormously in self-esteem.  The vanity of the selfless, even those who practice utmost humility, is boundless.&quot;<br /> Sound familiar ?  It is the terrorist mind.  It applies equally well to the John Birch Society and the militia movements as to the KKK and the anti-war fervor as to bin Laden and the Palestinian suicide-bombers.  In America, fanatics were relegated to the silly fringes of society.  In parts of the world, they are elevated to be heroes.<br /> The fanatic is forever with us.  The very definition of fanaticism rejects toleration for others;  yet, to survive, we must tolerate the ideas of others  -- even the most outlandish.  The answer is from one of the greatest Native Americans, President Benito Juarez of Mexico, who asserted &quot;Peace is respect for the rights of others.&quot;<br /> Hoffer outlined the problem with brilliance, but he failed to offer a solution.  Americans don't like open-ended problems;  from sit-coms to revenge for the World Trade Center, they want answers.  That is the weakness of the book, and perhaps why it isn't better known today.<br /> For now, the answers will be bombs, bullets and cruise missiles.  But, revenge only digs two graves.  On a long-term basis, the answer must surely be something along the line of Juarez's statement.  In ending his short book, Hoffer quotes J. B. S. Haldane who counted fanaticism among the only four really important inventions made between 3000 BC and 1400 AD.<br /> &quot;It was a Judaic-Christian invention,&quot; Hoffer wrote.  &quot;And it is strange to think that in receiving this malady of the soul the world also received a miraculous instrument for raising societies and nations from the dead  --  an instrument of resurrection.&quot;<br /> Or, in more prosaic terms, the inability to hold a grudge.s and nations from the dead  --  an instrument of resurrection.&quot;<br /> Or, in more prosaic terms, the inability to hold a grudge.	2001-10-05

This is the story of the bewildered 11-year-old Josie whose life is shattered one summer, and in response becomes the victim of other lonely people.<br /> &quot;Fear is good, fear is normal.  Fear will save your life.&quot;  Oates begins her story with this warning on the first page, and ends with it just four paragraphs from the end.  It is the story of a family that fell apart, and the harm that falls upon the innocent.<br /> The background is that Josie's mother left her husband and moved to another state, where her mother was soon engrossed in a frantic hunt to escape loneliness.  She forgot about Josie, alone and isolated and lonely in a new town with no friends, and with the healthy curiosity of a young girl.  A 25-year-old divinity student slips into her life and offers the attention to fill her loneliness, yet he has his own bitter demons.<br /> It is a story of sadism and domination, with Josie falling completely under the spell of the 25-year-old Jared.  He strips all of her clothes off, inflicts cuts on her breasts, dominates and degrades her with taunts of &quot;filthy little  --  filthy, filth  --  girl,&quot; ties her down with cloth strips to dominate her and leaves her &quot;in terror, animal terror, beads of sweat breaking out like flame on your body.&quot;<br /> She accepts such pain because Josie wants, &quot;Love.  Love.  Love Jared, don't hurt me.&quot;  Everyone wants to be wanted, and if this is the only &quot;wanting&quot; that Josie can find, she'll take it.  Her mother is emotionally absent, she's bullied at her new school, and that is why Josie turns to any substitute who gives her the attention she craves.<br /> Her mother finally defines the problem as her own inability to love anyone, &quot;. . . . . . . I've been so unhappy, I've been so undefined.  Every man I've ever wanted, when I have him I cease to want him  --  it's a curse.&quot;  Some people are like that.  Give them love, and their own sense of inadequacy drives them to hurt others who offer the most.<br /> Oates presents the story as a snapshot of life;  no moral judgments, no great lessons, no redemption.  It's simply a slice of life.  Most stories have a &quot;plot,&quot; but we don't think of finely crafted photographs as having &quot;a plot.&quot;  It's often said a picture is worth a thousand words;  in this case, Oates turns a few thousand words in a powerful picture.<br /><br /> If you want answers for the cruelties of life, it's not here.

It's the ultimate expression of personal ego, the belief that some tiny action of mine may change the whole course of history. (If the compass was one such example, then what might this book review accomplish ?)<br />Sadly, Azcel doesn't prove his point. He stumbles erratically through history, citing numerous interesting events without ever explaining why one invention suddenly prompted Europeans to build great fleets of merchant ships. Compass or not, no one can trade without having something to trade. Europe, at the time the compass was discovered by Europeans, was on the verge of a commercial explosion.<br />For a modern example, look at the Internet. It's based on transistors; the basic function of the transistor was evident at the turn of the century when a &quot;cat's whisker&quot; was used on a piece of galena to pick up the earliest radio signals. So, do we say the &quot;crystal radio&quot; was the spark that produced today's computers ? Likewise, Xerox in its Palo Alto Research Center invented many of the components of modern personal computers -- but it took a variety of other companies to develop these ideas into actual hardware.<br />The idea of the compass had been around for a long time; the sudden commercial expansion of Europe put a premium on every innovation that would facilitate and expand trade. The compass was one such invention; likewise, shipbuilding, banking, the legal system, many things changed dramatically to meet the new needs. The compass was like modern Global Positioning Satellites -- a great idea forecast by Arthur C. Clarke in 1946 but which didn't come into use until the 1990s  --  a lot of other factors helped make satellites a reality.<br />Clarke foresaw the potential of satellites; thousands of other contributors made them a practical reality. With or without Clarke, we'd still have satellites; without the thousands of other contributors, they would never have been developed. Aczel misses this element of invention, that it is driven by the needs of society rather than by the idle curiosity of clever people who have nothing better to do with their time.<br />&quot;Look folks, I've invented the compass,&quot; Aczel would have you believe that Flavio Gioia told the sailors of Amalfi in AD 1302. In response, they replied, &quot;Okay, let's have a commercial explosion and start trading throughout the Mediterranean.&quot;<br />Not really, eh folks ? The airplane didn't invent modern globalization, it simply made it easier. Likewise, 700 years ago, the compass made it much easier and safer for Europeans to do something they already wanted to do. That's why it remained European technology for so long -- other societies didn't have similar incentives, and thus didn't need these sophisticated technologies.<br />Had Aczel broadened the scope of his basic idea, his book would have been immeasurably better. He started with a good topic, but couldn't see beyond the limits of his own compass dial. He forgot that every now and then the helmsman needs to lift his eyes from the compass to make sure that an iceberg, another ship or a shoreline isn't looming dead ahead. Or, as the mate on a ship told me when I was a helmsman on a ship crossing the North Atlantic, &quot;Keep an eye out for the Azores, we don't want to run into them.&quot;<br />Likewise, Azcel should have looked around. His book is a good idea that is limited by a lack of logical context. He needed a compass himself to give this book the direction it is otherwise lacking.looked around.

US	49694975	R1IH0LWSXMZYBA	0452281423	146685771	The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty: A Novel (Sleeping Beauty Trilogy)	Books	5	8	17	N	Y	A powerful, dynamic, erotic book	This powerful book will shake the complacency of everyone who reads it.<br />If read as an allegory, it is a marvelous story about the subservient role all of us accept to function in society.  We face it every day in traffic;  we sometimes have bosses who are overbearing;  we deal with people who are a pain in the neck but to whom we must be polite.  Our whole lives consist of suppressing our natural urges and instincts out of respect for the rights of others;  in that sense, the human is never free, we are always a slave to the opinion and respect of others.<br />        From the beginning, Rice's story sounds like an allegory to military training in which the goal is to destroy the individual's sense of personal identity and replace it with loyalty to the group.  In the military, such dominance is enforced.  In private life, companies sometimes spend inordinate amounts of money to develop similar loyalty  --  consider the pressures to be a &quot;team player&quot; in most organizations.<br />        One of the key statements is on page 62:  &quot;She must please him, must make him loving again, and then any pain at all would not be too much.&quot;  Some women long to be dominated, they will do anything in an effort to please others.  It's very sad, really. That is the story of this Sleeping Beauty.<br />        It's why I have long been horrified by zoos;  the thought of animals deprived of their freedom breaks my heart.  Modern zoos are changing, one of the sad facts is that zoos have become necessary to save various animals that would be exterminated if left in the wild.  It's better, sometimes, to be &quot;in protective custody&quot; than extinct; that may also apply to loveless marriages.<br />        If so, Rice's story is a portrayal of the hell some women go through to please a husband.  Any woman who's been in that situation, any woman who's broken free of it, will understand and sympathize.  It will be exciting and erotic for them, because those feelings were part of their original love.  It may even be something to try again, but it will not be something they can live with for long.<br />        Various books are written as allegories.  Frank Baum wrote &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as a pro-capitalist story to counter the socialism that was prevalent at the turn of the century;  Jack London wrote &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; to justify socialism.  Both are still popular, with &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; regularly assigned in school.  It's no longer regarded as &quot;socialist&quot; literature  --  now, it's simply a good story.<br />        Rice may have intended a similar allegory for this book.  The popular image of marriage is of love and tenderness;  her book says some marriages are an indoctrination into strict and absolute obedience.<br />        This fight for dominance is by no means unusual.  Look at the continual battle among even pre-school brothers and sisters for dominance.  It's just not the older ones,  the younger will continually challenge.  The result is a continuing battle.<br />        Rice tapped into a universal theme, that of dominance and the yearning to please.  Some people demand unquestioning obedience, and I've worked for employers like that.  A popular term is &quot;control freaks.&quot;  Rice was clever enough to apply it to some very personal themes among people;  because it is very personal, it makes the story very frightening despite its intense eroticism.<br />        I'm reminded of &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; by Alexander Solzhentsyn, and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; by William Golding.  Solzhentsyn tells of the petty humiliations forced on prisoners to make them compliant;  Golding writes about an degenerating battle for dominance, and the need to inflict humiliation on the weaker.  Prison life is a good example of such behaviour, where daily lifeis a close example of some of the humiliations inflicted upon &quot;Sleeping Beauty.&quot;<br />        Even the name is demeaning.  She may have been the &quot;Sleeping beauty,&quot; but her real name is never used.  That is as demeaning as always referring to a person by a number instead of their name  --  a common habit in prison; or the &quot;Hey, you&quot; or worse by a domineering spouse.<br />        Rice taps into some of our deepest emotions and builds a scary story based on those feelings.  It's a powerful combination. The sex will infuriate some readers, but it is an essential element; the dominance theme will infuriate everyone who treasures individual freedom. But, if you read it at anything above a fairy tale level, it will make you think. And perhaps even cry. And that is good.. She may have been the &quot;Sleeping beauty,&quot; but her real name is never used. That is as demeaning as always referring to a person by a number instead of their name -- a common habit in prison; or the &quot;Hey, you&quot; or worse by a domineering spouse.<BR>Rice taps into some of our deepest emotions and builds a scary story based on those feelings. It's a powerful combination.

Segal dealt with college students;  Sparks has written a book that relates to high school and junior high students who have not yet begun to date seriously.  The theme of the book is very simple:  true love is based on the content of a person's character, not on chest size or the willingness to engage in sex play.<br /> It's a favorite theme of Sparks, the idea of an enduring love that overcomes and outlasts all obstacles and setbacks.  He used it well in &quot;Message in a Bottle,&quot; dealing with two middle-aged adults who are old enough to have sex.  In this book, it's two kids who  barely hold hands and share only a few chaste kisses, which makes it clearly designed and suitable for the teen and pre-teen audience.  Any normal teen will appreciate it;  and parents can feel safe the book is as tame as a Donald Duck cartoon..<br /> One brief excerpt, near the end, nicely sums up the whole approach:  &quot;We kissed again, too, though not every time we were together, and I didn't even think of trying to make it to second base.  There wasn't any need to.  There was something nice when I kissed her, something gentle and right, and that was enough for me.  The more I did it, the more I realized that Jamie had been misunderstood her entire life, not only by me, but by everyone.&quot;<br /> Think of the movie &quot;Titanic&quot; without any hint of sex or nudity, and you have this book in a nutshell.  &quot;Titanic&quot; made millions of innocent young girls weep copious tears for a love that was snuffed out by the disaster to the ship;  &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; will appeal to the same girls who want such a love to come into their lives.<br /> If you're a parent of a teen child, buy this book.  Read it yourself, it deals with a fate and feelings that many adults carry through their entire lives.  It is a warm reminiscence of a long lost love that might have been, and it tugs on those adult heartstrings.<br /> Then let your kids have it, it relates to them on their level and it is one of the best introductions you'll find to the meaning of love in contrast to the shallow sensual emphasis that dominates so much of today's movies and novels.  Kids who read it will grow into mature sensitive adults with an ability to understand that true love involves more than chest sizes and hot pants;  it will help them become true adults instead of perpetual teenagers.arent of a teen child, buy this book.

Granted, it's an excellent book,  Rybczynski is a charming writer who is able to discover and present pleasant little anecdotes about screws into a full length book.<br /> It's really a social history.  He wanders through the history of tools from ancient Egypt to modern power tools;  his description of the evolution of the hand saw which dates from at least 1,500 BC in Egypt is a fascinating account of how technology develops in response to a social need.  Rest assured, anyone who has even the slightest interest in hand tools will find every page fascinating.  Like James Burke and \\"Connections,\\" Rybczynski is a master story teller who is able to link diverse elements into an always interesting account.  About the only item mercifully missing is the thumbscrew  --  the old instrument of torture.<br /> \\"One of the rewards of building something yourself  --  a house or a bookshelf  --  is the pleasure of using tools,\\" Rybczysnki writes, setting the delightful theme of the book.  \\"Hand tools are true extensions of the human body, for they have evolved over centuries of trial and error.\\"<br /> One of the charms of the book is the questions that Rybczynski raises but does not answer, such as his assertion, \\". . . . while most of us would bridle at the suggestion that if Cezanne, say, had not lived, someone else would have created similar paintings, we readily accept the notion that the emergence of new technology is inevitable or, at least, determined by necessity.  My search for the best tool of the millennium suggests otherwise.\\"<br /> That issue is raised on page 110,  and again on the second last page of the 143-pages of text, when he talks of an invention \\"that owes its existence to human imagination rather than technological evolution.  And imagination is fickle.\\"  It's an idea worth keeping in mind;  Rybczysnki clearly comes down on the side of human ingenuity, the ability to come up with new ideas that may take time to find a practical application.  On this basis, he suggests Archimedes  --  who, like Leonardo da Vinci, was able to come up with dozens of ideas that were far ahead of the technology of his era  --  is the true father of the screw.  Interest, if true.<br /> Such thinking reflects the weakness, and also the strength, of the book.  Cezanne is certainly unique, but so is every snowflake.  The absence of a \\"Cezanne snowflake\\" doesn't prohibit the creation of other equally artistic snowflakes,  the key element is the science of snowflakes and not the genius of a seen or unseen snowflake.  Likewise, the key element of Cezanne was the artistic and social milieu in which he painted.  The Cezanne's who lived in a different era vanished without a trace.<br /> Technology is similar.  While the invention of a specific item may be the product of individual genius, it's adoption is determined by necessity.  Who knows?  Perhaps Archimedes also invented the can opener.  It didn't become popular, though, until the can was invented.<br /> This debate is what makes the book fascinating.  It is more than a study about the origins of an everyday item, it is also an exercise in questions, thought and ideas.  Rybczynski's charmed writing makes it a delight on both counts.of text, when he talks of an invention \\"that owes its existence to human imagination rather than technological evolution.

Tudge argues, and presents a mass of hard data to back his theory, that \\"domestic agriculture\\" began in response to environmental crisis and an impending food shortage.  Interesting, if true.  In all likelihood, we will never know for sure.  But, this book isn't valuable for its conclusion; it's worth reading because he examines an issue archaeologists overlook or ignore  --  the \\"why\\" of human progress.<br /> After all, why farm if your ancestors have lived for several million years merely by hunting and gathering for the few hours per week needed to be comfortable.  Tudge asserts, \\"They did it because they were forced into it when their paradise was taken from them and they were shoved together into hills that just turned out to be especially hospitable.  Arable farming is seasonal, but in the season it is hell . . .\\"<br /> This book, quite brief at 50 pages consisting mainly of background material, suggests why people may have given up the carefree lifestyle of hunting and gathering and become dreary farmers.  He cites apparent evidence for the beginnings of agriculture as far back as 40,000 years ago, not the merely 10,000 or so years as now thought.  When he is on solid material like this, Tudge has compiled a real service.<br /> Personally, using the exact same data, it's realistic to argue that people began farming for fun, because it made life more pleasurable.  It probably started 100,000 or so years ago, when people added flowers to their burials.  Flowers serve no practical purpose, but are an expression of beauty and respect for the dead.  It wouldn't take long for people to discover that a flower brought home for its beauty, after it is died and discarded, produces a new flower from the seeds of the old.  As the sense of personal happiness grows, the motivation would have been all the greater.<br /> Aha!!  We can have flowers at our doorstep, not just in the distant fields.  It's like a magpie, with its love of brightly colored objects.  It's a pure pleasure principle.  The same goes for the first domestic animals  --  anyone who has tasted wild and domestic animals knows the finer taste of domestic brands.  Baby pigs were brought back and raised, instead of being killed with the sow, and when they became adults the meat far much tender, juicier and tasty.<br /> Grain, and grapes, are wonderful.  There is ample speculation the first grain was not used for bread, but was mixed with water to make beer.  Grape juice will ferment on its own.  Both produce fun results;  drink them, instead of from the flowing stream, and a person feels happy.<br /> This book offers all the fundamentals to sustain my argument, and obviously all the basics to support Judge's thesis.  It's too bad he couldn't have added a \\"choose your own ending\\" element by adding another five or six pages.  Because of what his idea tells us about ourselves, it would be all the more valuable.<br /> Do we motivate people today, based on centuries of experience, with hardship and disaster?  Or do we use happiness as a motivator, as in the idea \\"it feels great to have a vigorous physical workout.\\"  When you review the basics, as succinctly offered in this book, it puts modern reality in perspective.<br /> The book is really about ourselves.  Are we noble savages, as Tudge and John Jacques Rousseau suggest, motivated only by fear and punishment?  Or are we pleasure seekers, eager to do anything that sounds like fun?<br /> This book offers one answer, clear and concise.  It is superb for that reason, and well worth reading.  Optimists won't have their viewpoint refuted, and will likely learn much just the same.  All in all, an excellent book.new flower from the seeds of the old.

Like all great timeless literature from the realm of combat  --  the Funeral Oration of Pericles, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and McCrae's In Flanders Fields  --  it is about ideals instead of ideology.<br /> In 114 words, dated Sept. 3, 1941, he celebrated the sheer joy of flight.  He could have had a scholarship to Yale in the fall of 1940 to study the classics;  instead, that October he went to Canada.  By then his father was assistant minister at St. John's Church in Washington, D.C., popularly known as \\"the church of the presidents.\\"  His parents hadn't been thrilled about his decision to fly instead of going to Yale, but they gave him their reluctant support.<br /> The poem, written on the back page of one of his letters from England, may have been his explanation of \\"this is why I like to fly\\" to his parents.  Having spent hours in the cockpit of many aicraft, from sailplanes to bush planes, and executive jets to a Flying Fortress, I understand the feeling.  I can't say \\"share,\\" because the single engine fighters of World War II created a brief era in flight that will never be repeated.  Today's jets are pure power, simply point and go anywhere;  World War I aircraft were sadly limited by a lack of power.  Magee flew when the sheer joy of piston engine power matched but didn't eclipse the nerve and ability of a pilot's feelings, reactions, skills and dreams.<br /> In only 28 pages, superbly illustrated by Toronto artist Michael Martchenko, Linda Granfield book tells how the spirit of a young man  --  somewhat rebellious and undisciplined to start  --  soared like the high flight he describes so memorably.  I first found the poem when I was in the seventh grade, some 50 years ago, and memorized it as part of the 200 lines of memory work that were required every school year.  It's the only poem from those years that stayed with me.<br /> This book is the first account I've read that describe's Magee's background, and how the poem came to be written.  In school, we were told it was \\"written on the back of an envelope.\\"  The real story, admirably told by Granfield, is more inspiring.  Truth is always better than fantasy or imagination.<br /> It's called a children's book.  Don't be fooled.  It's too good just for children.  Anyone who understands the soaring adventure of the human spirit will love it.  Magee made his dream come true.  Very few of us get to live a more perfect life.spirit of a young man  --  somewhat rebellious and undisciplined to start  --  soared like the high flight he describes so memorably.

Much of the victory credit belongs to a Canadian newspaper publisher in England, Lord Beaverbrook.  As Minister of Aircraft Production, he provided so many aircraft that the Royal Air Force ended the Battle of Britain with more aircraft than when it started.  For both sides, the crucial elements were production and tactics  --  German aircraft production didn't peak until 1944.  As for tactics, the entire German war effort was based on \\"lightning victories\\" such as the defeat of Poland and France.  The British relied on their old standby of being able to outlast any enemy.<br />  Granted, everyone \\"knows\\" about the Battle of Britain.  Deighton challenges the comfortable old myths about the war, and points out that a lot of \\"what we know\\" just isn't so.  The Germans deny there ever was a \\"Battle of Britain;\\" later in the war, they'd lose more aircraft in a single day of combat than during the entire August-September 1940 campaign against England.  The British victory is hailed as equal to the defeat of the Spanish Armada and Nelson's victory at Trafalgar,  a myth Deighton neatly punctures.<br /> A major element is the incredible blunders and mistakes by Germans and British.  War is truly a case of victory going to whoever makes the least mistakes.  These range from strategic and production decisions made in the mid-1930s, to Adolph Hitler's fatal hubris in the summer of 1940 that \\"the British have lost the war, but they don't know it;  one must give them time, and they will come around.\\"  Hitler only understood lightning victories; the British relied on being able to outlast their enemies.<br /> Without going into technical detail that would swamp the average reader, Deighton masterfully explains why choices such as a lighter breech-block on the Oerlikon MG FF was a handicap for German pilots, as was the British decision to use nitro-cordite ammunition after everyone else switched to nitro-cellulose.  Such details, explained in clear and concise form, are the treasure of this book.<br /> Add them up, and it becomes clear why Germany could not win World War II.  The British, for all their stupidity, had a democratic system in which errors could be corrected.  Germany had a dynamic leader, and the military knew it was better to procrastinate than to suggest corrections to his decisions.<br /> In short, from the Battle of Britain to VE-Day, Churchill spent the war being sometimes wrong and often being corrected.  Hitler spent the same time being sometimes right, without his errors ever being corrected.  That may not seem like much, except this book ties it all together to clearly illustrate the inevitable outcome of democracy versus a closed society.<br /> Deighton has done a masterful job.  He explains the \\"when, where, who, when and how\\" of the Battle of Britain as do most histories.  Most important, he explains \\"why\\" it was won.  Those six words are the \\"six honest serving men (They taught me all I knew)\\" of Rudyard Kipling and all journalism, which Deighton employs as a master.use nitro-cordite ammunition after everyone else switched to nitro-cellulose.

Such is his expertise.  I was in Cuba when Fidel Castro took power, and never heard a kind word about the thugs and murderers the Batista regime inflicted upon Cubans in order to maintain their pampered privilege.  The book offers no sympathy or understanding of what life was like under Batista;  but, it's filled with the so-called horrors of life in Cuba since then.<br /> Granted, there are Russians who genuinely miss the law, order and good government of Joseph Stalin.  So, it's hardly surprising there are Cubans who miss the good ol' days of Batista, when it really meant something to have money, power, position and privilege.  This book is little more than a pampered pout about the passing of the old regime;  anyone who wants to get a feeling about what it is like to live under tyranny needs only read `One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch.\\"<br /> Most patriotic Cubans who have any sense of the history of their people are grateful for the many accomplishments of the Castro regime.  Having achieved a great deal, they want to be free to accomplish much more on their own.  Their disillusionment with Castro is not that he made life better for 80 percent of the people;  it's that he's terrified of giving people the freedom to make life better for themselves.<br /> The Cuban success in the US is remarkable, and shows what free Cubans can accomplish.  But, they did not need to condemn 80 percent of their fellows to poverty and misery to succeed.  In Cuba, the tyranny of Batista kept most of the population in poverty and terror;  now, the tyranny of Castro keeps the majority of the population from soaring to the heights of their own individual success.  Batista produced terror, Castro produces mediocrity.  Take your pick as to which is worse.<br /> Suarez shows no signs of understanding the difference.  That makes this a great book for Gusanos, but useless for anyone interested in modern Cuba or the difference between tyranny and the freedom to be an individual.crity.

But, it is like the stories sometimes told by combat veterans in the Legion Halls after they've had a few beers, are feeling relaxed and are with someone they trust.<br /> It is a story about soldiers who were fiercely proud to be Canadians.  Americans were fighting for grand ideas such as \\"saving the world for democracy\\" and the Four Freedoms of Norman Rockwell.  Canadians were there to do a job.  They did it, with kindness, compassion and brutality as the occasion required.  Sgt. Cederberg never brags about being Canadian;  it was tacitly assumed that if one had to ask, they couldn't understand even if it was explained to them.<br /> Read this, and you'll understand why Americans described Canadian soldiers \\"going about their job like hockey players.\\"<br /> They are like the Australians and Israelis, known for having an incredible espirit de corps.  Americans are great for show, such as Patton insisting that all American troops wear ties and show proper respect for officers.  One American mucky-muck, appalled by the easy-going attitude, remarked to a Canadian officer, \\"Your troops don't seem to have much discipline, such as saluting officers.\\"  In reply he was told, \\"Well, when a salute is needed I wave at them, and they generally wave back.\\"  So much for formal procedures.  But, when it came to fighting, they were unsurpassed.<br /> The US has a formal definition of a country, such as the Pledge of Allegiance, Salute to the Flag, and a national anthem which is played more than Coca Cola commercials.  Canadians are less formal, but no less proud of their country.  It's called pride.<br /> In another story, Cederberg tells of the Germans firing propaganda leaflets which showed a naked woman sitting on the edge of a bed, while a soldier without his pants is getting ready to take off his shirt.  The message was that while British troops were in Italy, others were having fun in England.  \\"That a Canadian?\\" one of the men asked Cederberg, who replied, \\"It can't be, the guy's wearing a tie.\\"<br /> Don't ever mistake the Canadians for the British.  As Cederberg writes,  \\"I went out that afternoon with Albert and Alex-Joe, drank six pints of mild and bitters and threw up twice (once after punching out a Scottish corporal who had insisted we were a disgrace to British arms).<br /> \\"He had it coming,\\" said Alex-Joe.  \\"because we aren't even British, we're Canadians.\\"<br /> Time and again, that spirit and typically Canadian humor shows through.  So does the grim determination to get the job done.  When stationed near an Italian town, they were warned that lone Allied soldiers were sometimes attacked by die-hard fascist youths.  Sure enough, a Canadian was knifed in the neck.  When his buddies couldn't find his attackers, they went back to camp.<br />  A few minutes later, the Canadians began a mortar barrage on the town.  Officers tried to stop it, and were gently restrained.  Once they learned the reason for the barrage, they joined the cover-up to protect their men.  When the Italian police came to investigate, every weapon was spotless with no sign of recent use.  They left, empty handed.  The Italians buried their nine (or 34) dead (depending on whose version was accepted).  There were no further assaults on Canadians.<br /> Wonderful book, wonderful story.  Rest assured, Spielberg will never make a movie of it.

Grant	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	The Manager of the Civil War	Once upon a time, books of this nature were written by people such as Benjamin Franklin and called \\"Poor Richard's Almanac.\\"<br /> \\"Eat to live, and not live to eat,\\" Franklin advised in 1732, without crediting his wisdom to Socrates or Moliere.  The result was a very practical book, for people who consider themselves to be very practical Americans.  This book is similar, except for its somewhat narrower emphasis on leadership rather than the all-encompassing appeal of Franklin.<br /> Holton, Ph.D., does something better than Franklin  --  his method of instruction is by citing examples and then offering an explanation.<br /> \\"I never learned to swear . . . I could never see the use of swearing . . . I have always noticed . . . that swearing helps to rouse a man's anger,\\" is one such observation, from `Campaigning With General Grant.'  Bil (sic) Holton, Ph.D., explains, \\"Profanity is nothing more than a vulgar descendant of Neanderthal grunts\\" and goes on to point out that \\"Leaders who use it are suffering from delusions of its relevance.\\"<br /> It's a book of common sense.  Grant was not a man who would ride past marching troops, splashing them with mud and water;  he was not a man who demanded better food, instead he often ate the same food as his men; and to have a well-disciplined command, he did not consider it necessary to have an unhappy army.  Compare that to modern executives who think an imperial limousine, an executive dining room and the fear of employees are necessary elements of modern management.<br /> The book is successful on two levels;  first, it explains why Grant was the most successful general in American history, and secondly it explains how his methods can be applied to modern business and everyday life.  For example, Grant once asserted, \\"It is men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may expect the most efficient service.\\"  Holton, Ph.D., points out \\"Those who covet the next promotional opportunity usually miss relevant  --  and defining  --  work experience.  Fast-trackers eventually suffer from competence anorexia . . .\\"  Time and again we see this fault in modern corporations, the Business School graduate promoted into middle or upper management without having a clue about the product or employees who make the product.  Likewise, the employee who is always a toady to the boss without ever caring about fellow employees is an eventual loser.<br /> This is a book about common sense.  Grant was superb at it, which is why he so out-classed Robert E. Lee when it came to winning a war instead of fighting clever battles.  It's not manpower or supplies that make a conquering army, it's leaders such as Grant for whom the soldiers are ready to die.  There are two types of armies  --  those who fight, and those who run.  Grant's army knew it would never have to run.<br /> Grant was a winner, primarily because his soldiers respected him.  It's a good lesson for modern executives.  After all, if his attitude was more widespread among modern managers, there would be little need for books such as this or motivational experts such as Holton, Ph.D.<br /> Good management isn't in bossing people around, it's convincing people that they want to do what needs to be done.  When dying is a big part of that equation, it requires some mighty fine management.  That, in a nutshell, was Grant.<br /> Take away the glamor, the pomp and circumstance, the haughty style of a Napoleon, Pakenham or Lee  --  and the result is Grant.

US	49694975	RPEJFWMT2VY3T	0451191137	325409950	Anthem	Books	4	1	4	N	N	The original Dilbert	This fiftieth anniversay edition is even better than when it was first published,  with Rand's magnificent insight to the impersonality of the modern corporate world and its `organization man' mentality.<br /> Today, think in terms of Dilbert.  We now view corporate society with a sense of humor, people laugh at the conformity demanded of the business world.  In 1930s, with the rise of right wing dictatorships in Europe and their isolationist fellow travellers in the Americas, the thought of absolute corporate control was no laughing matter.  The result was a series of books, from `Brave New World' to `Animal Farm' and `1984.'<br /> Freedom is a wonderful concept.  No writer tells of people who willingly become corporate drones, the story is one of rebellion against such tyrannies.  Rand was one of the best who presented a chilling portrait of capitalist excesses that we have come to know, accept and sometimes laugh about.  I read this 40 years ago, and never dreamed then how much of her vision would come true by the year 2000.<br /> Anyone who is familiar with the Seattle and subsequent protests against the Worled Trade Organization will sympathize with this story;  it reflects the enduring struggle against the suppression of the individual by a domineering corporate culture.  Rand says in her 1946 introduction, \\"Those who want slavery should have the grace to name it.\\"  Unfortunately, today's corporate drones never have to explain why \\"it's my way or the highway.\\"  It makes the book more relevant today than when first written.<br /> Books such as these, written just as the vogue was starting for efficiency studies, employee motivation and other work more for less schemes were getting underway in the 1920s and 1930s, were a warning of an impersonal future.  Today, in a world of multi-national firms that casually throw 10,000 or even 100,000 people out of work merely to boost the stock price, this book has immediate meaning.  Any corporate employee may read this and wish, \\"Ahhh, if my job could only be this unstressed and simple.\\"<br /> There are two types of stories;  one is the horror of a tyranny which requires everyone to serve a vast impersonal corporation that has less personality than a desktop computer.  The other is the escape story, in which people flee the corporate world to a rustic paradise such as `Lost Horizon' and, in more recent years, `The Blue Lagoon' and `Cast Away' with Tom Hanks.  In her view, freedom is gained by running away, not be rebelling or overthrowing the system.<br /> Rand wrote one of the best.  It's a short escape story, just 80 some pages in the American edition that was published in 1946.  The publishers include a copy of the original edition, showing the changes she made nine years later for the American market.  It is a wonderful example of a writer's mind at work, illustrating how a truly good author is never satisfied with a final version.<br /> Read it.  Even in today's corporate tyranny, all hope is not lost.  Freedom, the worth of the individual even a world of cookie-cutter sameness, is still possible.  Just don't let the Cubicle Police catch you referring to it on the job.nd wish, \\"Ahhh, if my job could only be this unstressed and simple.\\" <br /> There are two types of stories;  one is the horror of a tyranny which requires everyone to serve a vast impersonal corporation that has less personality than a desktop computer.

The author spent three weeks plus a couple of days in Battle of Britain combat before he was shot down, burned so badly that he was out of action from September 1940 until early 1943.  The book was written during that long period of convalescence, when he had time to think.  When he recovered enough to fly, he vanished on a training flight.<br /> Hillary admits, \\"We were disillusioned and spoiled.  The press referred to us as the Lost Generation and we were not displeased.  Superficially we were selfish and egocentric without any Holy Grail in which we could lose ourselves.\\"  Those were the pilots, the majority of who died in defending their country in a manner that led Sir Winston Churchill to assert, \\"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\\"<br /> Hillary wrote about the attitudes of pilots and the public during those precious few summer weeks when Germany tried to seize control of the skies and then invade England.  Such terms as \\"heroic\\" come later, usually from those who weren't in the midst of it all.  British pilots and civilians were simply content to do a job and spare others the burden of such sacrifice.<br /> That spirit was nicely summed up by a London cab driver, when hundreds were killed every night and fires cut massive swaths through East London, who commented, \\"Thank God, sir.  Jerry's wasting `is time trying to break our morale, when `e might be doing real damage on some small town.\\"  Later, a chaplain from East London, told him \\"my people have fallen from grace:  they are beginning to feel a little bitter toward the Germans.\\"<br /> Hillary was one of the pre-war English elites who were educated at the better public schools such as Eton, Shrewsbury, Wellington, and Winchester.  He attended Trinity College, Oxford, where he spent a lot of time rowing and flying as a member of the University Air Squadron.  Except for the war, he could automatically have become one of the colonial ruling class of the Government of the Sudan, a \\"country of blacks ruled by Blues in which my father had spent so many years.\\"<br /> The war wasn't an exercise in grim determination to save democracy and all that rot.  Instead, for Hillary, \\"I was glad for purely selfish reasons.  The war solved all problems of a career, and promised a chance of self-realization that would normally take years to achieve.

I can vouch for its excellence as a twice failed nominee for such an award.<br /> Many years ago, setting out for a fishing trip on the Severn River just after the ice broke up, we came to a narrow rock cut where the river plunged 10 feet to 15 feet.  Other boaters had wisely halted, ready to begin several hours of arduous portaging.  We decided to take a closer look to see if we could run the rapids, running the motor at trolling speed.  If it wasn't safe, we could accelerate to full power and race away from the fast water.<br /> It wasn't safe.  Then, the motor stalled.  We went down the rapids, paddling like mad to stay in control.  We managed to survive unscathed.  A quarter mile downstream, the motor started without a hitch.  We puttered back to the rapids, intending to warn the others, and saw a second boat sail out breezily and plunge down the rapids.  It vanished.  The boat owner bobbed up about 50 yards downstream, and we raced to haul him out.  Then we asked why he tried it.  He replied, \\"When I say you guys cut your motor, I figured anyone could do it.\\"<br /> No awards that day.  But, it serves as an example of how not thinking, or acting on incomplete information, lures people into such trouble.  Some years later, I was taking photographs in a bull ring.  We'd all been graciously hosted with a bottomless pitcher of margaritas.  Fueled with such liquid wisdom, I decided on a never-taken-before photo of an enraged bull just after it charges past the matador's dramatically upflung cape.  To do so, I knelt on the ground about 25-feet from the matador, near the center of the ring, to take my picture.<br /> Everything went perfect until the cape was flung upward.  Then, with the big red target gone, the only thing left in the bull's vision was me.  I dropped to the ground before the bull could change direction or lower his horns;  he passed over me, smashing my camera.  Needless to say, I've never since been allowed into another bull ring.  The newspaper even ran a story about it, \\"Situation reversed:  Bull throws reporter.\\"<br /> So, I'm lucky.  God truly does favors drunks and fools.  But, there's a limit to such patience.  It's what makes this book rather poignant.  Time and again, it cites brave, daring, unique and foolhardy courage  --  that should have been avoided with a little thought.  It's a very dull person who has not, at some time in their lives, been involved in a situation that could have qualified for rank embarrassment if not for an actual Darwin Award.<br /> After all, it commemorates \\"individuals who ensure the long-term survival of our species by removing themselves from the gene pool in a sublimely idiotic fashion.\\"  It's great not to make the cut.<br /> Read it.  You'll be amazed at the sublime idiocy of some people, and perhaps of your own good fortune.  It's well written, with a marvelous light sense of humor;  and a reminder that some people are really unlucky.  Or, in blunter terms, stupid.ring.

Americans take freedom for granted, but much if not all of the world had less freedom than the US until the recent past.  The first half-century of American independence was marked by chaos, out of which a unique and growing American freedom developed which could not be shattered even by the War Between the States.<br /> Now, and I say this as a Canadian nationalist and not an American chauvinist, the rest of the world is catching up with the US.  The result is worldwide chaos.  The foundation of Canada has always been peace, order and good government;  in recent years, this complacent assumption has been challenged by Quebec separatists and the rise of a new political party in the western provinces.  Even at that, Canada is a mild case of chaos compared to what is happening in many countries.<br /> Giddens looks at this chaos in relation to a number of universal concerns  --  risk, tradition, the family and democracy itself.  In each case, as more people are given the right and ability to make their own decisions, a difficult transition to expanded freedom takes place.  Giddens examination of family values is an example of the controversy and confusion that is being generated.<br /> For almost all of history, families were economic units based on the ability of one person to provide an income and another to look after the household and raise children.  Now, with both people in a marriage able to earn a self-sufficient income, the basic nature of marriage is changing. It is no longer a case of economics, marriage now involves a democracy of emotions.<br /> On a personal basis, Giddens cites the example of a great aunt who \\". . . had one of the longest marriages of anyone. having been with her husband for over 60 years.  She once confided that she had been deeply unhappy with him the whole of that time.  In her day there was no escape.\\"  My own mother could have said the same.  Today, there is an escape.  Divorce is becoming ever more respectable;  once, it would have been unthinkable to elect a divorced president, yet no one questioned Ronald Reagan's divorce and the fact that his next wife was several months pregnant by the time they married.<br /> Now, add this freedom to all other elements of society.  Then, expand it worldwide.  The result of this phenomena is globalisation.  Conservatives in foreign lands denounce it as Americanisation, but it is purely an expansion of personal freedom.  When you get change, you get chaos.  Out of that, as shown by the chaos prior to the writing of the US Constitution, a newer and freer society sometimes emerges.  It's happening in Canada, in China, Cuba and worldwide.<br /> Giddens examines the basics of this growing freedom.  Once these basics are understood, the current chaos of globilisation can be seen as a dawn of expanding freedom rather than an insidious American plot to take over the world.  On that basis, every country will develop its own freedom even if it doesn't match the appearance of American institutions.<br /> Unless, of course, conservative forces of tradition seize power to end the chaos and restore peace, order and good government.  Freedom can be as diverse as every distinct society;  repression always wears the same stern face of not allowing people to make decisions for themselves.escape.

If past experience is a guide, thus the stage of revenge and pain is set for the next round of savagery in the Balkans.<br /> It's lasted for generations.  These are deeply religious people, basically Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Muslim.  Each faith has a long record of savagery toward others, a cruelty that can only be explained by the fundamentalist conviction that non-believers are devils.  It's why American forces are now in Kosovo, to provide a few months or years of peace.<br /> But first, some recent background.  During World War II, Germany broke up Yugoslavia and gave Croatia its independence.  Croatian armed forces --  the Ustasha  --  fought in Russia for the Germans, and in Yugoslavia became an especially brutal ally of the Germans.  They were opposed by the communist underground, led by Josip Broz Tito; and by Monarchists.  When the war ended, the communists took their revenge on both opposition forces.<br /> After the Soviet Union disintegrated, the collapse of central authority in Yugoslavia allowed for the rise of various ethnic factions.  Almost immediately, Germany recognized Croatian independence;  and the rest of Yugoslavia erupted into the chaos of various independence movements.<br /> What happened when the Confederate States of America declared independence?  It produced the bloodiest war in American history.  It also produced prison camps such as Andersonville;  and mass murders of Black soldiers who dared to work or fight for the Union but were later taken prisoner.  The Yugoslav story is not unique in its savagery;  it is merely contemporary.<br /> This book explains the reality of \\"ethnic cleansing.\\"  The term is deceptively antiseptic, it hides a bloody brutality of drunken Serbian thugs turned loose in an ecstasy of perverted pleasure to torture and beat half-starved Muslim prisoners to death.  Simple murders, such as a bullet in the back of the neck, may seem bad.  The Serbs are never so merciful, these savage beatings were to inflict maximum pain and often an agonizing death.<br /> Hukanovic hammers that point home again and again, sparing no detail.  It is a description of hate run amok,  where torture and pain became the ultimate pleasure for the Serbs.  This book is not one of combat, it tells of a hatred so lasting that it eventually erupts in depravity.  It is not unique to Yugoslavia;  a thousand years ago, Islam conquered India and left a divided people that may yet erupt into a nuclear war between Hindu India and Islamic Pakistan.  Likewise, similar hates have ravaged East Timor.<br /> Will it end?  Read this book, and ask \\"Will the Lord ever forgive them?\\"  It doesn't describe the geopolitics and other fancy words about the Balkans, it explains the pain, suffering, misery, torture and spirit of eternal revenge to inflict more pain, suffering, misery and torture.<br /> Then ask, \\"Should the US intervene?\\"  Or should the US pass by on the other side of the road, and leave victims of such savagery to suffer and die alone?

After reading it, anyone will easily understand why Tony Hillerman is still an \\"outsider\\" to many Native Americans.<br /> My dealings with the Zunis began in 1967, when I began writing stories about some aspects of life in Zuni and was honored enough to be the recipient of some of their teasing.  It's a good place to start:  British humor centers on clever word plays, American humor is blunt slapstick, while the essence of Zuni humor is kindly and gentle teasing.<br /> After all, they've lived and prospered in the Southwest for as far back as science can trace.  In Zuni terms, they've been here since the beginning of the world.  They learned to live in one of the harshest climates of the United States without depending on outsiders.  It's only since the coming of the Anglos, which Wyaco portrays as oddball outsiders who vary from insensitivity cruelty to bumbling kindness, that many Zunis have become dependent upon a sometimes crazy American world.<br /> His experiences in World War II, which included winning the Bronze Star, are an example.  The all-Anglo draft board in Gallup, which easily filled its quotas by drafting Indians, shipped him off to Santa Fe for his medical.  He wanted to join the Navy to get out of walking, but was rejected because he'd once suffered three broken ribs when he was kicked by a horse.  So, the draft board tried again and sent him off to the Army where he was accepted, even though he'd have to march every day.<br /> \\"It didn't make any sense then.  It doesn't now,\\" he writes.  The book is filled with such examples of non-Zuni illogic.  As a combat rifleman, he killed his share of Germans.  He was among the troops who liberated Dachau, and was horrified at how the SS guards had treated the dead.  He writes the dead \\"looked like juniper firewood just unloaded from a pickup truck, no more human than that, all naked and skinny.<br /> \\"The Zunis don't even kill birds without asking permission,\\" he states.  \\"To the Zuni, death is a transition time that must be handled with love and respect by one's closest family.  A person's body and hair must be washed, rubbed with corn meal, and pointed to the west toward Kothluwalawa, with prayers to guide the departed spirit on the way.\\"<br />  Wyaco was one of a dozen GIs who summarily executed 60 or so Dachau guards, who had surrendered without firing a shot.  He says, \\"I've never felt any remorse for my part in that execution.  Those SS guards were more like witches than like men.  They'd already lived too long.\\"  When he went home, a medicine man brushed him with a wing feather from an eagle and blessed him with corn meal to wipe away such bad spirits from the war.<br /> It's the only incident in the book that made him really angry.  The rest is an insight into traditional Zuni life.  It was written by J. A. Jones, a novelist and anthropologist who became a friend of Wyaco after the war.  Jones did a superior job, retaining the gentle teasing humor and manner of speaking that is characteristic of Zuni.  It is an art Hillerman never mastered, his books present acculturated Navajos dealing with traditional customs, but little of the \\"soul\\" of the People.<br /> Obviously, Wyaco doesn't reveal everything about Zuni life.  But then, as Wyaco points out, neither do any of the many anthropologists.  He offers something they cannot;  he explains the spirit, the meaning and the gentle humor of Zuni culture.  It's something no outsider can do.aked and skinny.<br /> \\"The Zunis don't even kill birds without asking permission,\\" he states.  \\"To the Zuni, death is a transition time that must be handled with love and respect by one's closest family.

Instead of community service, he became a wealthy lawyer for developers and was instrumental in creating the urban blight he so skillfully outlines in this book.<br /> A hundred years ago, Phoenix was the smallest of the four major Southwestern cities (the others are Tucson, Albuquerque and El Paso).  Now it is the largest, and is growing by an acre of new homes per hour.  At that rate, as Gammage notes, growth can continue uninterrupted for another 672 years.<br /> What is the new Phoenix?  In Gammage's words, \\"A small narrow lot, a relatively large house, and a two- or three-car garage combine to produce neighborhoods with a different feel than those of even ten years ago.  Houses seem squeezed together by non-existent side yards.  Garage doors, lined up to a mandatory setback line, become the dominant feature of the streetscape.  Front yards are shallower, with less grass . . . the desert is covered by acres of concrete tile.\\"<br /> Everything is geared to growth, at the lowest possible cost to developers.  When the first Interstate freeway was built through Phoenix in the 1960's, it went below ground in elite neighborhoods and then soared to 25 feet above ground in low income areas.  The elevated portion was often called &quot;our Berlin Wall&quot; and it destroyed poorer neighborhoods, providing cheap land for \\"slum clearance\\" and industrial space.  No interchange was ever built to serve Guadaloupe, a low-income Yaqui village on the freeway;  but, when a developer was appointed to the highway commission, bulldozers were at work within six months building an interchange for his speculative subdivision.<br /> Obviously, as an attorney for developers, Gammage doesn't highlight problems.  Yet, two out of three new residents to Arizona leave the state within five years.  The Phoenix downtown crime rate is five times the national average.  Arizona has the highest percentage of children without adequate medical care of any state, including Texas.  It has the second-highest high school dropout rate.  Believe it or not, here in the Sonoran Desert, it's against the law to grow sagebrush in your front yard.<br /> It's what makes this book so worth reading.  It's a lesson in every sweet-talkin' word that you'll ever hear from developers and their lawyers.  Read it in conjunction with `The Death and Life of Great American Cities\\" by Jane Jacobs, often regarded as one of the great urban thinkers of the past 40 years.  This book clearly and proudly offers the opposite of everything Jacobs advocates.<br /> For Phoenix residents, it's a chilling account of change from \\"the city that Los Angeles wishes it could be\\" into a mass of urban sprawl that even LA wouldn't tolerate.  Gammage does an excellent job; he is articulate, knowledgeable and one of the best lawyers developers can hire.  As one of the local asphalt companies proudly says on its billboards, \\"We really lay it on thick.\\"  So does Gammage.<br /> For outsiders, it explains why two of every three newcomers flee within five years, most within a year.

The first TV  broadcast was that of a Maltese cross, transmitted a distance of at least  two feet.  It's one of the delightful stories on the nature of inventions  offered by David Lindsay, which is really a series about the oddball habits  and ideas of people who invent things.<br /> When 16-year-old Polly Jacobs  was dressing for an evening party in 1914, she rebelled against the masses  of undergarments then worn by all respectable ladies.  Her response,  Lindsay says, was to tell her maid \\"Bring me two of my pocket  handkerchiefs, and some pink ribbon ... and bring the needle and thread and  some pins into my bedroom.\\"  A few minutes later, she emerged with the  first brassiere.<br /> When Thomas Edison wanted to promote the use of  direct current and discredit alternating current, his lab paid neighborhood  urchins to round up stray dogs and cats.  They were then electrocuted with  alternating current, or as the media of the day reported, the process was  \\"to be Westinghoused.\\"<br /> Lindsay has a keen eye for the little  oddities, roadblocks, persistence and showmanship that moves new ideas into  popular use; plus, sometimes, the outright theft of new ideas by major  corporations.  Anyone who's ever come up with a fresh idea can appreciate  and sympathize with the fate, follies and fortunes of men and women who  never lost faith in their own bright ideas.<br /> It's a book about the  personality of inventors, which is very different than that of people who  merely improve existing products.  When King Camp Gillette invented the  first disposable razor, he came up with the first new idea in shaving in  thousands of years.  Invention of the \\"double blade\\" is hardly in the same  category, despite the fervent pleas of advertising executives.<br />  Inventors are oddballs, Lindsay writes, \\". . . perhaps it's because human  folly is intimately bound up with the actual work of inventing.  Doing the  `wrong thing,' after all, is not so very different from doing the new  thing.<br /> \\"Put the other way around, if so many inventions start as  mistakes, it's probably because some humans are especially prone to making  them,\\" Lindsay writes.  That is the key to his delightful book, a brief  survey of 21 everyday items that are so common we scarcely think of them as  being \\"invented.\\"  It'll give heart to everyone who's ever wondered about  an original idea.<br /> Frozen food?  Yup. it had to be invented.  Clarence Birdseye, spending a winter in northern Canada, saw how quickly  fish caught by the Inuit were frozen solid  --  and later thawed out and  eaten with no loss of taste.  For how many thousands of years had that been  done?  Until Birdseye, no one had figured out it would benefit American  households.<br /> Of course, Birdseye also had to invent store freezers,  and a distribution system to keep food frozen during shipping.  Nobody ever  said inventing was easy.  Now, frozen food is a $10 billion industry.  That, so well explained in this book, is how great inventions come to be  commonplace.rs.

Until then, the fastest way to send a message was  at the speed of a running horse  --  or, for short messages, a carrier  pigeon.<br /> In 1838, American portrait painter Samuel Morse used  electricity to send a message.  He asked for funds from Congress to finance  his work, and was turned down.  He spent much of 1838-39 in Europe, and was  unable to attract any interest.  Finally, in 1843, he was granted $30,000  by Congress and set to work to build a telegraph line from Washington to  Baltimore.  The wires were 15 miles from Baltimore when the Whigs held  their national nominating convention in 1846;  the results were sent by  horse to the end of the telegraph line, and the message was then  transmitted to Washington.  It arrived 64 minutes before a fast train  bearing the same news.<br /> Two years later, there were 2,000 miles of  telegraph lines in the US;  by 1850, twenty companies were operating 12,000  miles of telegraph lines.  The system spread like wildfire, like kudzu, or  in more modern terms  --  like the Internet.<br /> It was magic, based  on the definition that \\"magic\\" is something we don't understand.  In  today's world the Internet is simply an enhanced version of the telegraph,  as was the telephone, radio and television.  Perhaps today the only thing  comparable would be conversing with someone anywhere in the universe  --  erasing the limitation that communication cannot travel faster than the  speed of light.  Obviously, this is impossible according to our present  scientific knowledge;  before the telegraph, communication using  electricity was equally impossible.<br /> Standage does a beautiful job.  Anyone who's familiar with the Internet will notice dozens of parallels,  including the prediction the telegraph (Internet) will bring world peace  through communication.<br /> One fault, and this may be a subject for  another book:  the telegraph produced instant communication for a very few;  the telephone expanded that, but was essentially person-to-person or  \\"point-to-point\\" communication.  The Internet offers relatively cheap links  among all people;  for a few dollars a month, I can set up a dot com or dot  org or other such site and send my message to the world.  Now,  \\"point-to-everyone\\" communication is possible.<br /> Every improvement  makes it possible for more and more communication at less and less cost.  It's like the vast expansion of the right to vote since 1837.  The  telegraph was a giant step in enabling people to communicate easily, and  invariably more knowledge means more democracy.<br /> Society, from  village to nation, is people with common interests who share ideals.  Until  now, such interaction was controlled by priests, monarchs, political  leaders or demagogues.  The telegraph made mass democracy possible, because  it flooded everyone with information.  Now, the Internet allows anyone to  talk to one person or the world.<br /> As with the telegraph, governments  are looking for ways to control the Internet.  The status quo always gets  nervous when people talk among themselves.  Controls are not likely to  last.  Like the telegraph, the Internet will enhance democracy.  In China,  it has already given rise to Falun Gong which covers about 100 million  people and operates completely outside the old power structure.<br /> In  time, the Internet will undermine any regime that ignores the people.  Just  look at the reviews for this book  --  do you trust the old `one reviewer  knows all' system, or the uninhibited views of a variety of people?  The  past is truly prologue.raph produced instant communication for a very few;   the telephone expanded that, but was essentially person-to-person or  \\"point-to-point\\" communication.

Ammann	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Engineering as an experience in beauty	During the first half of this century, American bridges became the largest  and most beautiful structures ever built;  Othmar Ammann, a Swiss engineer  who came to New York in 1904, was the quiet genius who built six of the  very best.<br /> George Washington, Bayonne, Triborough, Bronx-Whitestone,  Throgs Neck and Verrazano-Narrows are his monuments;  like the skyscrapers,  literally \\"invented\\" in New York, the builders of suspension bridges  perfected their art in the US.  It shows what can be accomplished with new  wealth, pride and vision.  One of the finest is the Verrazano-Narrows  bridge;  the towers for the cables are as high as a seventy story building.  To put this in perspective, that's twice as high as the tallest  \\"skyscraper\\" in Phoenix.<br /> Each tower was assembled with 10,000 steel  cells, fastened with six million rivets and two million bolts.  The Empire  State Building has 365,000 tons of steel,  the bridge has 1,265,000 tons.  Like the Parthenon, where the pillars were sculpted to present the most  pleasing appearance, the bridge towers are tapered from top to bottom.  The  two towers are plumb, but the curvature of the earth means the tops are one  and five-eighth inches further apart than the base.  Since metal expands in  hot weather, the roadway at the center of the span rises or falls by 12  feet during a temperature change of 100 degrees.<br /> Bigger bridges will  be built.  Some will be more beautiful.  But these six are the ones that  set the standard.  Everything from now will be an adaptation of them.  It's  like the Golden Age of radio, or television, or movies, or the Internet;  experimentation and innovation is always greatest when technology is  new.<br /> A suspension bridge is truly an artistic sculpture, because it  is based on natural curve of a cord strung between two points.  Look at a  spider's web, the curve of a bird's wing, or wheat bending in the wind;  there is a contrast between nature and the massive stone blocks of earlier  bridges.  The book is admirably illustrated with more than 200 photos;  they show the artistry, and the incredible labor that went into the  construction of each.<br /> In today's society, when lowest cost seems to  be the only consideration, some wisdom from Ammann in 1958 stands out, \\"In  fact, an engineer designing a bridge is justified in making a more  expensive design for beauty's sake.  After all, many people will have to  look at the bridge for the rest of their lives.  Few of us appreciate  eyesores, even if we should save a little money by building them.\\"<br />  It shows good design is possible, and adds a great deal to a community.  Like Will Bruder's design of the new Phoenix library, skillfully described  in the book &quot;Phoenix Central Library&quot; by Oscar Riera Ojeda, et  al, this book is a must for anyone interested in better communities.s of earlier  bridges.

In 1810, when Fr. Hidalgo issued his immortal `Grito del Dolores' that  launched Mexico's War of Independence from Spain, the average Mexican was  better off than most Americans.  The American Revolution, then the French  Revolution, ignited the fires of freedom throughout the Americas.  Mexico  was one of the first to raise the proud banner of freedom.<br />  Conservatives fought back, as they did in the 13 Colonies, and turned  Mexico into a savage battleground.  In the United States, successful  Revolutionaries exiled defeated \\"United Empire Loyalists\\" to Canada, the  Caribbean and England;  in Mexico, in one form or another, both factions  fought for a century.  More than half of Mexico, what is now the US  Southwest and California, was lost.  The continuous war, plus an invasion  by France, plundered Mexico of its wealth.  In 1876, Porfirio Diaz imposed  order;  by 1910, after 34 years of the increasingly brutal Porfiriato  despotism, the \\"underdogs\\" were ready to explode.<br /> In one form or  another, Revolution lasted until 1929.  Peace finally came to Mexico when  the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI) organized a national  government and held power until the year 2000, when the presidency was won  by Vincente Fox Queseda of the National Action Party (PAN).<br /> Los de  Abajo, printed in 1915 as a serial in an El Paso newspaper, was the first  novel of the Revolution of 1910.  It is still the finest description of the  mood of people who made the revolution;  a blunt description of the sheer  joy of total destruction by people who had been crushed until all hope was  lost.<br /> \\"Peace is respect for the rights of others,\\" President Benito  Juarez had said in the 1860's.  The lack of respect for the Underdogs  produced the Revolution;  no respect, no peace.<br /> The central  character, Demetrio Macias, when asked by his wife why he fights, tossed a  pebble into a ravine and watched it roll to the bottom.  Alberto Solis,  often regarded as Azuela's spokesman in the book, compared the revolution  to a hurricane, \\"The man who surrenders to it is no longer a man but a  miserable dry leaf tossed about by the storm.\\"<br /> Azuela writes about  the futility of the conflict.  A doctor, he served with Francisco Villa's  famed Division of the North, \\"Los Dorados,\\" but he criticizes the folly and  brutality of the Underdogs as well as the cynicism and venality of Los  Ricos.  Once you understand this nihilism, it becomes clear why Mexicans  accepted one-party rule and corruption from 1929 until 2000.  It also  explains why so much hope is now placed on the PAN presidency.<br />  Prosperity is a product of freedom;  but, there is no freedom without law.  Before 1910, the Diaz tyranny was the law;  the Revolution forever smashed  the laws of tyranny.  It takes time to build a new society  --  too long  and too self-serving for the PRI, say the critics.  But, when you  understand the Underdogs, you wonder if it could be any other way.<br />  Democracy in Mexico?  Azuela writes of wiping the slate clean, to give  democracy a fresh start.  The PRI restored order and allowed a peaceful  transition of power.  If it fails, as some say it has in Chiapas, this book  explains the spirit of Mexico that will fight again until freedom is  assured.<br /> It's not just a novel of the past, it's a warning to the  future of what happens to anyone who betrays Mexico.  It's the best book  ever written about the continuing Revolution that, slowly and irresistibly,  is producing a modern free Mexico.acias, when asked by his wife why he fights, tossed a  pebble into a ravine and watched it roll to the bottom.

With the exception of a  few papers, and no television stations, news is based on the idea \\"comfort  the comfortable advertisers, afflict the welfare victims of society.\\"  It's  called \\"press release journalism\\" and reflects the basic reason for the  decline of many modern papers, the timidity and fear of editors who limit  news coverage to people and events about which press releases are offered.  Years ago, I worked beside a reporter who had a big \\"No guts, no glory\\"  sign above his desk;  it took awhile to realize the emphasis of the paper  he worked for was \\"no guts\\" because any original work might upset powerful  friends of the publisher.  Readers know \\"a flawed watchdog is better than  no dog at all;\\"  but editors have muzzled the watchdog for fear someone  will object to its bark.<br /> I've been an editor at various times from  1968 through 1996;  on every occasion the paper gained circulation.  Hamill  talks about quality, which he doesn't define except to say \\"it is good  stuff.\\"  My approach was to emphasize local news and provide commentary  with a sharp edge  --  scorched earth journalism, one fan called it  --  recognizing that we couldn't obtain the kind of quality Hamill stresses.<br />  The secret of good commentary isn't excellence;  it's readers who know they  have the complete freedom to respond.  In many cases, I gave them a  prominence equal to my commentary.  No one ever agreed with me all of the  time, but everyone knew they had a right to reply and their response would  not be trivialized.  It's the most important element in establishing trust,  the willingness to respect readers.  Hamill is wonderful at  analyzing the past;  this is a man who loves newspapers, and is a superb  observer of the human condition.  His book \\"Why Sinatra Matters\\" is a  slender classic that offers more insight and understanding of Sinatra and  America than any of the mighty and lengthy biographies.  He brings the same  expertise and passion in his analysis of newspaper failures.  This book  offers dozens of examples of why papers are dull, dull, dull.<br /> Anyone  who's disappointed in the quality of newspapers can sympathize with the  faults Hamill outlines.  For example, a recent local report of a major fire  with damage in the millions of dollars failed to mention the name of the  company or their product  --  but, it had extensive interviews of  bystanders who came to watch the fire.  It's what passes for news;  bystanders who think the flames were very impressive.  In the modern  newsroom, it's called \\". . . the human touch.\\"<br /> Give me a break.  Tell me about the fire, and I'll add my own human touch.  I don't need a  newspaper telling me that bystanders are impressed by big flames.  Give me  local news and the right to talk back.  That's precisely what Amazon.com  does with reader reviews of books  --  it gives ordinary people an  uncensored forum.  It's why Amazon.com is a success;  and the opposite  attitude is why newspapers are either static or declining.<br /> Hamill  points out, \\"Newspapers emphasize drama and conflict at the expense of  analysis.\\"  He's two thirds correct;  people want facts, not conflict and  drama.  But, they want facts, not analysis which used to be rare and  clearly identified.  Readers are smart enough to make up their own minds,  provided they get accurate information.  What are facts?  Briefly, the old  reliable \\"Who, What, Where, When and How.\\"<br /> This is a superb book for  analyzing the faults of modern newspapers;  but, it falls short on offering  solutions.  Hamill thinks the fault is centered on absentee owners who  don't understand the newsroom;  my experience says it is based on \\"press  release\\" journalism which changed the \\"watchdog of the community\\" into a  tame \\"little bark and no bite\\" puppy.ed the \\"watchdog of the community\\" into a  tame \\"little bark and no bite\\" puppy.	2000-08-26

Springer, after all, offers classic Shakespearean themes of  love, hate, betrayal, revenge and triumph in the form of risque snippets  about real people edited into a highly profitable 47 or so minutes.  He's  got all of the elements of Shakespeare, except he crams them into a  bleeped-out version of what used to be called \\"tabloid trash.\\"<br /> For  the average viewer, the essence of a Springer show is, \\"See, some people  are dumber than you.\\"  It's the same formula supermarket tabloids use,  reassuring their readers that the rich and famous led lives that are as  miserable or worse than any reader.  Misery loves company, and stupidity  loves a crowd.  Both vastly outnumber the elites of society.<br />  Schlossberg is popular and powerfully influential.  He knows how to draw a  crowd.  Forget about intellect, his emphasis is the creation of empty fun.  He appeals to museums that want thousands of admission fees, but don't care  whether the patrons learn a thing.  Life is no longer about education, it's  about playing little games in a setting that offers absolutely no danger of  intellectual exercise.<br /> He is an astute, engaging and perceptive  writer;  the opening chapters of his book dissect the impact of new  technology upon old culture.  Then, his analysis falls apart;  instead of  educating people to appreciate the quality of excellence, he pretends the  Beatles equal Bach, Beethoven and Brahms.  A generation ago, the Beatles  might have been the first step on the road to musical knowledge;  today,  people such as Schlossberg thinks that's as much as anyone needs to  learn.<br /> The result, in the media, in museums, in symphony orchestras,  in dramatic theater, is a dumbing down of content.  His goal isn't to  uplift the masses to a new level of excellence;  instead, it's telling  people there's great merit in the lowest common denominator.  He's very  successful at it;  he founded a company called `Edwin Schlossberg Inc.'  that advises cultural institutions how to reach the masses.  To use a  sports metaphor, his approach isn't to offer a finely tuned discussion on  the physics of the curve ball;  instead, he says if you play and understand  sandlot ball, you'll have a better appreciation of major league  baseball.<br /> He may be right.  For too long, the social elites looked  down their noses at anyone with a lesser understanding of high culture;  Schlossberg is an expert at discovering the simplest elements of culture  and using theme to explain overall themes.  No one can pretend the old  methods succeeded;  leaving the failures of the past behind, Schlossberg  explains how the twenty-first century will build a new cultural awareness  from the ground up.<br /> There are dozens of institutions and attractions  that are ineffectively welded to the past;  this book explains the new  emphasis on understanding for the masses instead of privilege for the  elites.  The older generation may be horrified at the prospect of the  Beatles and Beethoven;  but, more progressive people will understand how  lowbrow culture inevitably leads some to highbrow excellence.<br /> In  other words, the world has a massive range of attractions.

US	49694975	R2YZKIQW8XG7MY	0316347965	368477948	Why Sinatra Matters	Books	5	39	45	N	N	The man who owned loneliness	It is enough to say \\"Sinatra,\\" any literate American knows that means only  Frank Sinatra  --  the singer, draft-dodger, actor, bully, womanizer, Mafia  star, founder of the old Hollywood Rat Pack and the Chairman of the  Bored.<br /> In this loving portrait, Hamill explains Sinatra as an  American icon.  In so doing, he explains a lot about the values of the  United States;  this isn't a country where you become an \\"American\\" by  getting off the boat or, in today's terms, wading across a river.  Several  factors are involved;  starting with basic talent, then a single-minded  ability to work hard, plus an instinct for self-publicity, and finally that  most American of all characteristics  --  redemption, the ability to rise  above defeat and start over.<br /> Sinatra is the only major star of the  1940's who remained popular into the 1980's and whose music has rarely been  matched.  The entertainment world has a voracious appetite for fresh young  talent; for most, the formula for lasting success was nicely summed up in  the 1949 film `Knock on Any Door' when Johnny Romano says, \\"Live fast, die  young, and have a good-looking corpse.\\"  Sinatra tried and failed to get  the part of Romano in the film, it went to John Derek.  John who?<br />  Sinatra matters because he represents the American faith in redemption.  He  became the top vocalist in the early 1940's, was washed up by the end of  the decade; then worked his way back to respectability and a roller coaster  career.  His story is as current as the year 2000, and Hamill's version of  it will remain popular for years to come.<br /> It's the story of pride;  in Sinatra's youth, the Italians were regarded with less favor than illegal  Mexican immigrants today.  Rosemary Clooney had a hit with \\"C'mon-a my  house,\\" which embarrassed Sinatra and made many Italians wince;  Sinatra  mastered the delicate intricacies of English pronunciation which enabled  him to add subtle yet commanding enhancements.  He wasn't simply a crooner,  there were hundreds of those when he began his career in the late 1930's.  He worked exceedingly hard to create a sound and mood that still defines  the loneliness of a long empty night.<br /> Hamill brings out the  character of Sinatra that made him a success.  He ignores his dark alter  ego, the \\"evil twin\\" that contributed nothing to the legend.  This isn't a  biography, although it covers much of Sinatra's life;  the focus is on his  success, then his redemption.  For that reason, it's a better book than  most biographies;  instead of dates and places, Hamill explains what made  Sinatra so popular.<br /> How else do you explain a kid who was a high  school dropout, but who recorded hundreds of songs that had more impact  than any diploma?  It's why he was finally awarded an honorary doctorate  from a college;  success wasn't in following the old rules, it was a  triumph over the odds.<br /> After reading \\"Why Sinatra Matters,\\" it's  easy to understand the success and intense hatred generated by two modern  politicians  --  Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.  Like Sinatra, both men  were \\"born again\\" in terms of reviving their careers.  Nixon came back as  the \\"New Nixon\\" in 1968;  and, in 1992, Hillary saved Bill's political  career by going before the nation to forgive his amorous past.<br /> \\"Most  Americans love stories of redemption, of course, but men identify more  often with the tale of the hero, the man who comes back wearing the scars  of battle, harder and wiser than when he left,\\" Hamill writes.  That sums  up Sinatra's career; and, in some ways, the redemption of Nixon and  Clinton.  Both politicians reverted to their old ways, a failing Americans  cannot forgive.<br /> Sinatra was an honored guest at Nixon's second  inaugural.  After Watergate,  he said of Nixon, \\"You think some people are  smart, and they turn out dumb.  You think they're straight, they turn out  crooked.\\"  I shudder to think would he would have said about Clinton.<br />It nicely sums up Sinatra.  In understanding him, you learn a lot about  America.r />  It nicely sums up Sinatra.  In understanding him, you learn a lot about  America.	2000-08-14

It has an  interesting subject, authentic settings (I'm familiar with the area on a  first-hand basis), and addresses a relevant topic.  The author is  well-informed, astute, sensitive and quite capable of projecting these  traits onto paper.<br /> Trouble is, I'm not female.  Women are process  oriented, they want to see how something is done and understand the  personalities involved.  Men are results oriented;  Rambo is a good  example, a man with zero personality and tremendous results.  Men like  stories that say, \\"I came, I saw, I conquered.\\"  Women's stories express  the idea, \\"I saw someone with a need, I figured out how to help, and  together we accomplished something worthwhile.\\"<br /> It's what I call a  \\"slice of life\\" story;  the central character is a big-hearted, homeless  Vietnam vet who has to fend off the ever-helping hands of his sister and  other do-gooders.  His principle concern is his grandmother, but no one  else seems to care or understand.  Other than that he is content with his  life, and has no desire to adopt his sister's plateful of troubles that  include a boyfriend who's a cop and a former boyfriend who's a drug dealer.  The author looks at her two central characters, plus those who impinge  upon their self-satisfied \\"take life as it comes\\" lifestyle, and in effect  concludes \\"people can do pretty well if you leave them alone.\\"<br /> If a  man had written this book, the central characters would have gone from  desert rats to the executive suite.  Look at Larry McMurtry, for example,  from `The Last Picture Show\\" to \\"Dwayne.\\" his latest novel.  McMurtry's  characters become raging success stories, and are still psychological  basket cases filled with bundles of raging anxieties;  Dailey's characters  stay right where they are, but they put to rest any lingering inner demons  that have troubled their souls.<br /> In one, success means going from a  Ford Escort to a Lincoln;  in this book, problems are solved and you get  the impression by the end \\"these people are going to live happily ever  after.\\"<br /> In other words, it's a good book to read.

It goes downhill from there.  Fantasy?  Not likely.  It's  real.  A child does not have to be very old to play \\"Let's put the car in  the garage.\\"  Kids are infinitely curious.  This isn't a parable about what  kids are liable do when they're left alone;  it's a horror story about  parents' fears of the modern world.<br /> Back in 1954, at the height of  fears about the Cold War, atomic bomb and the very real horrors from the  atrocities of World War II, William Golding wrote \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"  It  was about a group of British boys stranded on a desert isle who turn to  utter primitive savagery among themselves, a parable of the nuclear age.<br />  Now, the Cold War has gone away.  In its place, we have blatant sexuality  in films, on TV and saturating the ad industry.  Lingerie ads in today's  family magazines are more daring than explicit pictures would have been in  \\"men's magazines\\" in 1954.  Kids see it all;  most ignore it, laugh it off  or reject it.  Some don't.  That is the premise of Simona Vinci's story.<br />  There was never any proof that `Lord of the Flies' could become real.  No  group of British schoolboys was ever abandoned on a deserted island to see  how they would react without adult supervision.  The premise of Golding's  story was that all people are savages just under the shallow veneer of  civilization.<br /> Today, are 15-year-old boys left alone?  Are  10-year-old girls in sight at all times.  If not, what are they doing?  Would you trust your 10-year-old with a 15-year old from just down the  block?  Especially one with his own motorbike.  When did the game end and  what took your kids so long to get home?  When does choir practice end and  how long does it take your kids to get home?  How innocent are modern kids?  Watch Jerry Springer or any of his clones to learn what kids know and do  on their own.  Remember, your kids are also watching Springer?<br />  This isn't a \\"Forever\\" by Judy Blume, an idyllic picture of tender  consensual sex among teenyboppers.  It isn't about \\"Speak\\" by Laurie Haise  Anderson, about a ninth-grader who's been raped.  There are any number of  fact-based books describing real life;  Vinci writes a horror story, \\"this  could be happening ...\\"  Blume implies teen sex is wonderful, sweet, gentle  and innocent;  Vinci says 10-year-old girls can be used and abused by  15-year-old boys, and the result isn't nice.<br /> In 1954, \\"Lord of the  Flies\\" was hailed by critics and sold all of 2,500 copies in its first US  edition.  It wasn't until 1959, when it was published as a paperback and  picked up by teens and college students, that became a runaway success.  After all, it couldn't really be true.

US	49694975	R2GM2SA699H3Q3	0691009333	135333275	Justice Is Conflict	Books	5	20	38	N	Y	The foundations of our justice	Like the superb book \\"A Darwinian Left\\" by Peter Singer, this is a marvelous discourse on one of the fundamental principles of our society  --  for anyone who wonders about the meaning of life, both are fascinating  excursions into the realm of new thought.<br /> This book is founded on an  image out of the Middle Ages  --  when two men, wrapped from head to toe in  gleaming steel, carrying wicked lances, mounted on massive horses, charged  full speed at each other to settle disputes about truth and justice in the  confrontational medieval way.<br /> That, in essence, is the basis of  `Justice is Conflict.'  It's been the basis of Anglo-Saxon justice for at  least a millennia, and for unknown hundreds of years before that.  It's far  from the idea that \\"might is right,\\" instead it embodies that God is on the  side of the just.  Movies always depict it in that manner.  From the  meekest knight to the American fictional cowboy with a six-gun on his hip,  justice always triumphs.  It's a confrontational system of justice based on  combat, as explained by Thomas Jefferson when he said he was not afraid to  tolerate error \\"so long as reason is left free to combat it.\\"  The key word  is &quot;combat.&quot;  Today, when lawyers challenge each other in court  battles, they are staging a ritual re-enactment of those old jousts.<br />  In contrast, the Navajo spirit of K'e emphasizes a consensus system of  justice.  The goal is not that God can be counted on to favor the just;  instead, it is a search to find truth and thus assess blame properly.  There's usually no clear \\"Guilty\\" and \\"Innocent\\" verdict;  instead, blame  is assessed on a proportional basis.  In other words, even if you are  guilty, perhaps you are only 90 percent guilty.  Perhaps the other person  did contribute somewhat to the problem.  Perhaps the solution requires a  compromise to achieve justice.  Harmony, rather than win-loss absolutism,  is prized.<br /> Hampshire is undoubtedly correct in asserting that our  society is based on the ethics of confrontation;  he asserts this eternal  \\"conflict\\" produced our modern world.  He's very persuasive;  and, as a  friend used to say, \\"Interesting . . . if true.\\"  But, what was the  situation a thousand years ago when  Europe was the weakest and most  backward region in the world.  The question then, is whether transforming  the direct confrontation system of justice into a careful and precise  ritualized procedure made all the difference, or were other factors  involved in European society becoming dominant.<br /> Twenty-five hundred  years ago, Plato argued for the Navajo approach  --  reason should be used  to achieve agreement and harmony among warring ideas.  That was at a time  when society worshipped a pantheon of gods;  two thousand years ago, the  concept of a single God began to take hold.  The same idea took hold in  matters of justice;  instead of a panopoly of truths, people began to seek  one truth  --  a person was either guilty or innocent, with no Mr.  Inbetween.  Justicfe became an all-or-nothing decision.  Forget about the  middle of the road,  the only thing you find there are yellow stripes and  dead armadillos.  As Thomas Paine said in 1792 in `The Rights of Man,'  \\"moderation in principle is always a vice.\\"<br /> Hampshire, like Singer,  goes to the heart of what makes our society tick  --  perhaps.  It's a book  for readers who like to think about philosophy and the fundamental roots of  our society.  These books will make you think; for people who love ideas,  Hampshire and Singer are two original thinkers.  Both are eminently worth  buying.hat our  society is based on the ethics of confrontation;  he asserts this eternal  \\"conflict\\" produced our modern world.

Instead, the first half of the book talks about material inventions such as the printing press, electric motors, telecommunications, the plow, the static electricity machine, the caravel, hay, clocks, the atomic bomb and the Internet.  The second half deals with ideas such as marketing, calculus, the scientific method, secularism, the scientific method, the clock, economic man and other ideas that change the way we think.<br /> It's done with humor on occasion, as in the nomination of the thermos bottle which \\". . . keeps cold things cold and hot things hot.  But, how does it know?\\" In each case, the relevant invention is briefly described and its material and intellectual impact is explained.  One of the greatest American inventions of all times is overlooked, the invention of \\"the list\\" -- such as the book itself.  Americans love to make lists such as \\"the greatest inventions of the past 2,000 years\\" and the \\"best 100 books of the century\\" and the \\"best home run hitter in baseball.\\" You name it, there's an American list for it.<br /> That's part of the fun of the book.  Other readers will undoubtedly come up with their own omissions -- this book was compiled by nonimations from about 100 prominent scientists and thinkers.  In itself, that suggests another distinctly American invention -- the one-upmanship of the expert by the average person. It's part of the social fabric of the United States; when Jeff Bezos came up with a list of 20 possible business ventures using the Internet, his employer at the time ranked selling books at the bottom of the list.  So, Bezos went out and invented Amazon dot com -- a typical American approach to the experts who says something is impossible, impractical or irrelevant.<br /> One of the fun things to consider is that this book had its origins on the Internet, at Edge.org, and a discussion among scientists and thinkers.  Yet, here it is in the form of movable type used to place ink on paper -- which, one of the contributors, is a technology that dates at least to the Minorans of 1,700 BC.  That's the nature of ideas; you spend all of your time inventing something, then people use it for some entirely different purpose.<br /> Think of poor old Thomas Edison, who invented a practical means of recording sound and then expected it would be used to record the last words of dying people, or to enable clocks to announce the time, or to teach spelling to children.  Instead, to Edison's disgust, it was used to record music!  Can you imagine?  With a band on every corner, musicians in every bar and theatre, someone came up with the idea of using the phonograph to record music.<br /> That's what makes this book fun, enlightening, well worth reading and quite relevant to own.  It will do two things for every reader: first, it will show how our world came to be, and second, it will prompt many readers to ask, \\"Why didn't they include . . .  ?\\" Brockman compiled a wonderful list, and he also left out a wonderful list. That's the beauty of America (which he overlooks), no matter how good your product, someone is always able to come up with a new and unexpected way of using it.

It's a good story, shucked of the religious fervor  with which many people praise Lincoln, but she seems to stumble on the most  element feature of Lincoln  --  his abiding faith in the common man.<br />  As Morris points out, in this age of debunking heroes, few men were ever  more unsuited for the presidency than Abraham Lincoln.  Plain and simple,  he was a country bumpkin.  Yet it is precisely for this reason that Lincoln  is arguably the nation's finest president.  Like Harry Truman, he  represented the people;  his greatest speeches expressed a boundless faith  in the individual and in America.<br /> Granted, she's British.  She has  that innate British belief in the duty of \\"the better class\\" in society to  do good for the common person.  Morris doesn't understand the instinctive  American dislike of being bossed around, of anyone telling them what to do.  She thinks in terms of \\"peace, order and good government.\\"  Americans  celebrate the ability of rebels to succeed.  In England, the top hatted  image of nobility is that of someone with a duty to society;  in America,  the image of the pompous nobility is that of someone who needs to slip on a  banana peel.<br /> Lincoln grew up in the era when American identity was  being forged.  He was six years old when the War of 1812 ended;  that was  the time when astute observers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Alexis de  Tocqueville outlined the innate character of Americans.  The Civil War was  the clash of two fundamental American principles;  first, every person's  \\"right to do as I please,\\" and, second, \\"one nation, indivisible, with  liberty and justice for all.\\"<br /> Lincoln was a common man.  In today's  terms, as Morris pointed out, his parents would be \\"trailer trash.\\"  He  worked all of his life to rise above his humble beginnings.  He  instinctively understood the common person's desire to be free, and the  freedom to do better; a principle nicely expressed in a speech at Peoria on  Oct. 16, 1854, \\"No man is good enough to govern another man without that  other's consent.\\"  It's an attitude that is fundamentally opposite the  British mentality, which believes \\"Good men have a duty to rule others for  the benefit of the governed.\\"<br /> Lincoln wasn't an accident.  He  reflected the best of his era, a time when President Benito Juarez of  Mexico could assert, \\"Peace is respect for the rights of others.\\"  Canada  became independent in 1867, just two years after Lincoln died.  Lincoln was  a genius in expressing the American desire for freedom;  Morris fails to  understand the extent of this desire for freedom.<br /> Her great  advantage, in viewing Lincoln as an outsider, is a lack of hero worship.  Had Lincoln been in office today, he'd make Bill Clinton look like a  choirboy.  Had Clinton been in office during Lincoln's time, the Union  would have been dissolved according to the latest public opinion polls.<br />  Lincoln was the final act in establishing the self-image and distinct  identity of the United States of America.  Before Lincoln, is was common to  say the United States ARE a great nation;  after Lincoln, and to this day,  Americans are proud to say the United States IS a great nation.<br />  Morris touches on this, and in so doing explains much about \\"who\\" Lincoln  became.  She presents a fascinating insight into Lincoln, the man;  she  ignores the setting, failing to explain how Lincoln put the final touches  on the nation building that had been underway since 1815.<br /> All in  all, a very good book.  It could be better, but there's many that are  worse.  It's well worth buying because of the assessment of Lincoln, the  man.  When you understand Lincoln, as the man, it helps explain the success  and failure of presidents during the past 50 or so years.Lincoln, as the man, it helps explain the success  and failure of presidents during the past 50 or so years.	2000-07-19

It is no accident that Toronto is often rated as one of the most livable cities in North America  --  Jane Jacobs lives there, and she takes an active role in helping shape her adopted city.<br /> She also does  something original;  she actively examines the topics she writes about,  instead of relying upon the mere observations of others.  When you use a  chunk of granite, a bar of steel or the speed of light, it's worth knowing  that inanimate objects don't change much.  But, Jacobs and all other social  scientists deal with people;  and people are continually changing.  One of  her central themes is that since Adam Smith in 1776, economists have tended  to ignore the real world.<br /> \\"Smith himself was partly responsible for  that blind spot,\\" Jacobs writes.  \\"He led himself and others astray by  declaring that economic specialization of regions and nations was more  efficient than economic diversification.<br /> \\"The theorists after Smith  retreated into their own heads instead of engaging ever more deeply with  the real world,\\" Jacobs writes.  \\"Plenty of observable, germane facts were  lying around in plain sight, ready and waiting to lead Smith's insights,  straight as directional arrows, into the subjects of development and  bifurcations.\\"<br /> Adam Smith overturned centuries of thinking when he  wrote, \\"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the  baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard for their own  interest.\\"  Until then, there was a general feeling that God, or Nature, or  other supernatural force provided our sustenance;  Smith said personal  interest is the key to economic life.<br /> Smith takes that idea the next  step:  Yes, natural products exist, but we can wipe them out by overuse.  Every system in nature is harmed by over-indulgence;  nothing can be  exploited without some collateral cost.  Excess carries the seeds of its  own destruction;  humans are a part of nature, and thus subject to similar  limitations.  Thus, the book's title  --  \\"The Nature of Economies.\\"  Every  society is a part of nature;  people are always subject to the inevitable  laws of nature.<br /> This isn't tree-hugging ecology or a `Save a Whale  for Jesus' fad;  it's the fundamental rules by which nature, and thus our  communities, live on a day-to-day basis.<br /> Consider a real example:  Phoenix literally \\"paves the desert.\\"  Twenty years ago, climatologists  knew this raised night temperatures, because asphalt soaks up heat during  the day and radiates at night.  Night temperatures have risen by almost 10  degrees  --  which adds immensely to air conditioning bills, and greatly  reduces livability.  Yet, city officials steadfastly ignore this feedback  to pursue a policy of unlimited growth.  Is this unusual?  Think of Los  Angeles traffic, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, El Paso, and Tucson  --  each with  its own growing problems.<br /> Jacobs argues the \\"nature of economies\\"  means being aware of feedback, and facing issues before they become a  crisis.  Despite her living in Toronto, do Canadians do it?  No, Canadians  ignored overfishing of the Grand Banks  --  once the richest fishing area  in the world  --  until the area was fished out which caused the economy of  Newfoundland to collapse.<br /> In brief, that's her lesson.  Ignore  feedback, ignore the evidence in front of our eyes, and we'll have economic  and social collapse.  Nature never offers \\"Get out of Jail Free\\" cards.<br />  Unlike many ecologists, Jacobs doesn't offer simplistic \\"get rid of the  automobile\\" solutions.  She says problems will arise whatever we do;  the  solution is in recognizing the feedback, then responding to the problem.  In other words, \\"Look around.\\"  Then ask, \\"What can we do different?\\"  She  doesn't offer solutions;  she offers thought processes to enable  intelligent people to find solutions.<br /> Does she have a valid point?  Well, Toronto officials listen to her, and have one of the best cities in  North America.  It's time her audience was expanded.in  North America.  It's time her audience was expanded.	2000-07-18

Even though it only had one-eighth of the population of the United States -- 90 percent of whom were slaves -- Haiti produced 60 percent of the world's coffee, vast quantities of sugar and other tropical produce.  (Jamaica was just as valuable for Britain, which helps explain why neither country cared much about whether the 13 colonies became independent or not.)  These were the \\"cash cows\\" of the 1700's. In 1791, the Haitians launched the only successful slave revolt in history.  Napoleon, when he added up the cost of defeat in Haiti, quickly sold Louisiana to the US.  He knew better than to ever again involve France in a war in the Americas.<br /> Today, the average Haitian earns about $250 a year. About 70 percent of Haitians are unemployed, about 85 percent are illiterate, and one million live in the United States and other rich countries where the earnings they send home keep their families from outright starvation.<br /> What happened?  Quite simply, greed. Generals, politicians and businessmen plundered Haiti, in some cases reimposing virtual slavery.  President Teddy Roosevelt got the United States involved, and after a century of American cash plus the US Marines, Haiti is still the poorest country in Latin America.<br /> In this brief book (at only 80 pages, it's what used to be called a pamphlet), Jean-Bertrand Aristide outlines a solution.  It's the same sentiment expressed by William Shakespeare in the play Julius Caesar, \\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\\" Aristide applies the same wisdom to Haiti, principally through his efforts to generate self-sufficiency.  The key is not what others can do for the poor of Haiti, but what poor Haitians can do for themselves.<br /> Teach people to read, help them start farms and businesses, provide a shield against the ruthless cruelty of international finance, and Haitians will create their own wealth.  Prosperity is not a gift of foreign aid or advisers, it is what people do for themselves.  Some help is needed, which is why Aristide founded `The Aristide Foundation for Democracy'...However, the principle element of this book centers on the Haitian effort to help themselves.<br /> \\"The neo-liberal strategy is to weaken the state in order to have the private sector replace the state.  Through cooperatives we can perhaps preserve some margin of public services,\\" Aristide writes.  It is one way, very effective so far, to offset the tremendous power of the 1 percent of Haiti's people who control 45 percent of the country's wealth.<br /> True, he offers a grim picture of existing poverty.  But, he also shows Haitians reviving their own pride, respect and a better life.  Freedom does not rest on handouts or foreign arms (Haiti disbanded its armed forces in 1995).  Americans learned that in 1776 when they declared independence.  No one \\"gave\\" Americans independence, liberty and prosperity -- though France did provide a lot of help -- it has to come from the heart.  Aristide is kindling the same spirit in &quot;Eyes of the Heart.&quot;<br /> He eloquently outlines the need, and the Haitian solution.  Instead of merely feeling guilty about the poor of the Third World -- about three billion people live on less than $2 per day -- Aristide outlines the reality.  He also shows what can be done, and how people can make meaningful contributions.<br /> For starters, buy the book.  Profits from it benefit the Foundation, and may well pave the way for more meaningful donations that won't be wasted.or of Haiti, but what poor Haitians can do for themselves.<br /> Teach people to read, help them start farms and businesses, provide a shield against the ruthless cruelty of international finance, and Haitians will create their own wealth.

One of the simplest facts he ignores is the US Air Force funding of \\"flying  saucer\\" research in the 1950's;  think of it, a 199-page book that totally  ignores the only known research done on the feasibility of building and  flying a genuine flying saucer.<br /> Let's face it.  New Mexico is one of  the poorest states (I lived there off and on since 1967, as recently as  1996), with some of the lowest education standards in the nation.  Albuquerque, where Smith is based, has one of the nation's highest crime  rates  --  the city has declined precipitously since the 1960's.  You don't  see states at the top of the economic and social scale claiming to see  \\"flying saucers\\" that are driven by kind-hearted ambassadors who will  rescue us earthlings from our folly.  Like the `cargo cults' in the South  Pacific after World War II, such miraculous interventions are the product  of a superstitious culture without much hope for improvement.<br />  Roswell is in \\"Little Texas,\\" not quite in the oil-patch but close enough  to be infected.  Except for the political boundary, it's more Texas in  attitude than New Mexico.  Smith misses this primary element of the Roswell  area, and in general ignores the mystical \\"New Age\\" atmosphere of New  Mexico.  It's his major fault  --  the book doesn't have a specific focus.  It wanders from topic to topic like a bored TV viewer with 500 channels to  watch, never stopping long enough to understand anything.<br /> It's a  shame.  Smith tackled one of the most interesting situations in New Mexico,  and turned it into utter boredom.  Roswell, the `little gray men,\\" flying  saucers and the nature of government coverups deserve much better.shame.

Does anarchy work?<br /> After reading this fascinating book, you may be tempted to answer \\"Yes.\\"  Granted, Gordon doesn't even tiptoe near such topics.  She is a careful, articulate scientist with a penchant for patient  and precise observation and the ability to resist any temptation to leap to  interesting conclusions.<br /> For years, we've been fed stories about the  Ant and the Grasshopper, \\"It is thrifty to prepare today for the wants of  tomorrow.\\"  Proverbs 6:6 urges us to \\"Go to the ant, thou sluggard;  consider her ways, and be wise.\\"  The Koran advises us, \\"Not so much as the  weight of an ant in earth or Heaven escapes from the Lord . . .\\"  If Big  Brother wants us to work, so Big Brother can relax while we labor, then Big  Brother has a hundred ways to tell us about the virtues of being as  industrious as ants.<br /> So, Gordon spent 17 years in the summer Arizona  desert to discover just how hard ants really do work.  She learned that no  ant would be as dedicated as her and her students;  for one thing, ants  tend to knock off work when the day gets too hot, and many tend to goof off  a lot.  However, when they do work, they accomplish a lot without a need  for bosses or ideologies.<br /> \\"No ant is able to assess the global needs  of the colony, or to count how many workers are engaged in each task and  decide how many should be allocated differently.  The capacities of  individuals are limited.  Each worker need make only fairly simple  decisions.  There is abundant evidence, throughout physics, the social  sciences, and biology, that such simple behavior by individuals can lead to  predictable patterns in the behavior of groups,\\" Gordon writes.<br /> In  other words, chaos works in organizing basic survival tasks.  To me, it  suggests a means by which wandering hunters and gatherers organized the  first communities, many of which do not appear to have a recognizable  hierarchy.  Her observations suggest that people, from the earliest days to  today's neighborhood self-help groups and corporate world, are able to  achieve specific tasks without needing a hierarchy of bosses and  motivational experts  --  provided they know what is expected of them.  In  brief, \\"You know why you were hired  --  go do it.\\"<br /> Gordon didn't  write this to suggest \\"Here's how to run your company\\" or as a new way to  organize society.  It's a book to make readers ask, \\"If ants function in  this manner, will people do the same if left alone?\\"  Rather than managers  frantically scurrying about to prod worker ants to get a job done, the  conclusion from this book might be called the Little Bo Peep School of  Personnel Managers, \\"Leave them alone, and they'll come home . . . wagging  their tails behind them.\\"<br /> Ants \\"know\\" what needs to be done;  a  home, food, security against thieves and more ants to keep the system  going.  Every ant, presumably, has an equal interest in achieving these  goals.  Our society is much more complex, because of our dependence on  material goods and genetically modified foods.  We may need good managers  to outline specific tasks.  However, Gordon's work suggests that we don't  need ideologues to dictate a course of action for a whole society.<br />  In 1934, Lewis Mumford summed up the need to boss people around, \\"The  clock, not the steam engine, is the key machine of the modern industrial  age.\\"  Instead of such outside control, Gordon's studies suggest the key  for knowledge workers is, \\"Leave people alone.\\"  Perhaps today Mumford  would say, \\"The ant, not a pushy boss, is a key example for the modern  knowledge society.\\"<br /> Gordon isn't so foolhardy as to suggest any  specific outcomes.  A careful scientist, she limits her observations to  observations of ants.  But the wealth of information she presents will  persuade everyone who reads `Ants at Work' to think for themselves.

It was relatively peaceful, and as one of the most cultured  cities in the West it attracted some of the world's best actors and  musicians.  It was a tough law and order town, as proven by the \\"Gunfight  in the Alley Near the O.K. Corral.\\"  Badmen stayed away, they whooped it  up in Charlestone and Galeyville.  Ever hear the old song, \\"She's Only a  Bird in a Gilded Cage'?  It came out of Tombstone's most famous brothel,  and was a lament for one of the working girls.  It was a town of almost  unimaginable riches that crashed and burned within a few years.<br /> In  this setting, Champlin crafted a story of a defeated Confederate officer  who'd ridden with Mosby's guerilla raiders.  Capt. Brady Cox Brandau  returned home after the war to find his home had been treated as badly as  the northern homes he used to plunder.  Instead of rebuilding, like  Scarlett O'Hara, he set out to prolong the war  --  like the James brothers  in Missouri.  In the 1880's, when Tombstone was probably the richest city  per capita in North America, it became his target.<br /> Plausible?  Of  course.  Keep in mind that Geronimo, accompanied by about 60 men, women and  children, keep half of the entire U.S. Army busy during much of the 1880's  without losing a single person.  Meanwhile, the army sustained at least  1,500 casualties and even then didn't catch him until he was old enough to  collect Social Security.  Champlin's story centers on one Confederate  officer, with about 10 followers, who was interested mainly in obtaining  gold and banknotes.  Compared to Geronimo, the fascinating element is that  it could all be true.  If the \\"bad guys\\" got away in real life (most of  them don't in this book), it would explain where all the stolen loot  disappeared to.  In modern times, Arizona is known for Charlie Keating  (nobody found much of his funds);  in times past, it's possible that even  cleverer operators got clean away with their gains.<br /> It's got all the  usual characters for a typical Tombstone tale of the West:  a clever bad  man, a beautiful female spy, a lone Secret Service agent, Virgil and Morgan  Earp brothers, plus a drunken Indian.  Every time Champlin writes himself  into a corner, one or more Apaches suddenly pop up to rescue our heroes.<br /> It's the type of escapist tourism literature that keeps Tombstone  alive to this day.  Tourists don't want the real thing, they want to  remember the Old West as their imagination portrays it.  This book does a  good job in reinforcing old myths, with an interesting and ingenious new  twist, that makes it an easy and pleasant evening read.n't in this book), it would explain where all the stolen loot  disappeared to.

Who runs Canada?<br /> The Queen of England, according to some Americans, though most would say \\"Canadians elect their own government.\\"  In Canada, similar to many countries, there's a suspicion the Americans really control  everything important.<br /> The Avro Arrow, a delta-wing twin-engine jet  interceptor with a top speed of about 400 miles an hour faster than the  F-18, came off the assembly line in Canada in 1957.  It was in production,  with six finished and 30 more on the assembly line, when it was canceled by  the government on Feb. 20, 1959.  Since then, the fate of the Arrow has  become representative of what many Canadians feel is the second-rate role  of their country in comparison to the United States.<br /> Campagna blames  the Americans, who told the Colonel Blimps in the Canadian military in the  late 1950's that bombers were obsolete and only missiles would matter in  the future.  Sure, tell THAT to the guys who still drive the B-52's, B-1's  and B-2's around the skies.  I blame the Colonel Blimps, who listened to  the Yanks with all the innocence of little old ladies in tennis shoes  trusting a used car salesman with a Yugo to sell.<br /> Well, maybe the  Americans were wrong.  Bombers continue to fly, interceptors continue to be  built.  It's not the first time an American has made a mistake.  In the  U.S., cancellation of an aircraft contract is barely noticed;  in Canada,  the Arrow was the only fighter interceptor in the whole country.  Many  Americans would say, \\"Well, that's life in the big city.\\"  For Canadians,  with an economy about one twelfth the size of the U.S., it was  devastating.<br /> It's what makes this book so valuable for Americans.  It boldly lays out the devastating impact a minor decision in the United  States can have for a little country trying so hard to produce quality  home-designed products.  American companies have had dozens of promising  fighter projects canceled  --  but, dozens survived.  In little countries,  national pride often rests on a single project.  When it is scrapped  because of anything involving Americans  --  even as innocuous as \\"Give me  your honest opinion, now, don't spare my feelings\\"  --  the result can be  devastating.<br /> It was the best in the world  --  see my review of `The  Immortal Beaver' for another best-in-the-world Canadian airplane, one the  Americans bought in great quantities  --  but the Arrow was canceled due to  faulty American advice (Campagna's view).  My view is that Canadians were  dumb to listen to the Americans.  Whatever, the result is lingering  anti-Americanism.<br /> When Americans ask, \\"Why don't they like us?\\"  about any foreign country, the reason is often as innocuous as the loss of  an Arrow.  That makes this book valuable for Americans, to understand the  impact of their mistakes on foreigners who trust them to know everything.  It shows how, even when they are being helpful, kind, courteous and  considerate, American advice is sometimes devastating.  Do you really  expect a guy with a Yugo to tell you there's a better deal just down the  street?<br /> That's life as a World Power.  It's not about to change.  Mexico has similar complaints about the US, but when Guatemalans complain  about \\"the colossus to the north\\" they mean Mexico and not the US.  Little  countries will always have this attitude about their big neighbors, and  this book is an excellent example of the lingering resentment it causes.  It's why some preach isolationism, to avoid such headaches.  For others, it  is an invaluable primer on the troubles that even the best and most honest  intentions can cause.<br /> Anyone who deals with Canada will find it  offers a valuable insight to the schizophrenic attitude of love/hate for  everything American, and the attendant pride/doubt about anything Canadian.

A few years ago, the wonderful British comedy `Are You Being Served' on Public Television portrayed a delightful group of store clerks and supervisors in a parody  --  some might say a documentary  --  of a  traditional London department store.<br /> At `Grace Brothers' the counter  clerks were superb, the floor walker was properly pompous but utterly  decent, the supervisors clueless and the store owners were totally  befuddled but always wonderful.  It was fiction, it was funny.  Had been  set in Canada, it would have been `The Eaton's.'<br /> Instead, this  superb book is available.  It bears out Marx's observation that all history  appears twice, \\"the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.\\"  McQueen  has written the tragedy, hopefully some clever Canadian comedian is now  writing the comedy.<br /> So, what does a Canadian book about an unknown  department store  offer American readers?  It's the painful story of how a  family can totally ruin a revered national institution through their own  hubris, arrogance, indifference and plain ignorance.  I've seen it happen  in some businesses within two generations;  the Eaton family was more  typical in that it took four generations.<br /> The lesson is that times  change.  In 1870, when Eaton's was just starting, store goods were  sometimes expensive, shoddy and unsuitable and unreliable.  Timothy Eaton  realized the most important guarantee for a customer was five words, \\"Goods  satisfactory or money refunded.\\"  Today, most consumer goods have  consistent quality, guarantees are almost automatic and customers look for  something different  --  price.<br /> It's why Wal-Mart succeeds;  its  stores are big charmless boxes with indifferent clerks and mass anonymity.  But the attraction is a reputation for low prices.  It's why Amazon dot com  succeeds; the Internet makes it possible to combine low prices with superb  service.  The four Eaton brothers who ran the chain  --  which once had  almost 60 percent of Canada's department store sales  --  were oblivious to  change.  They committed the worst sin in business, instead of adapting  \\"they did as Daddy did.\\"  The title for the musical comedy of this story  will be \\"How to Go Bankrupt Without Really Trying.\\"<br /> Sure, other  stores collapse.  Where's Woolworth's these days?  Look at Sears.  Add up  the J.C. Penney balance sheet.  In Arizona, the Goldwater stores that  funded the political career of Barry Goldwater vanished.  This book  details, sometimes with agonizing reality, why even a national institution  can be reduced to irrelevancy.<br /> One example may suffice.  Some years  ago, Eaton's stocked a particular item that invariably sold out within  days.  To solve the problem, the item was dropped because they couldn't  keep it on the shelves.  Wal-Mart would have ordered more and put it on  sale to attract customers;  Eaton's was embarrassed by empty shelves.  Add  up thousands of such petty mistakes by owners who ran Eaton's on the basis  of offering customers what they should have instead of what they wanted,  and you have the recipe for disaster.  McQueen is unsparing in this  portrait of self-indulgent arrogance.<br /> Anyone who deals with  customers will benefit if they read it on the basis, \\"Do we do that?\\"  I've  seen the Eaton attitude in a dozen or more family businesses, run by owners  who have the emphasize \\"We've got the money to pay the bills\\" instead of  responding to customers' wants.  When anything replaces customer  satisfaction, the business is headed for decline.<br /> Eaton's did it,  going from the most revered department store in Canada to bankruptcy within  a generation.  Anyone can do it if they follow Eaton's formula of elitist  indifference to customers  --  it's not patented.  Many people will do it,  even without reading this book.  Some who want to avoid it will read this  book.  An old saying nicely expresses its value, \\"A smart person learns  from his mistakes, a wise person learns fromthe mistakes of others.\\"rom the mistakes of others.\\"	2000-06-02

Dave McIntosh was there, flying 41 combat missions in the  navigator's seat of a Mosquito night fighter, and he calls it \\"the scardest  generation.\\"  It takes common sense to be afraid;  fear is often the one  element that provides the extra margin of caution needed for survival.<br />  It helps explain why the 24 Mossies of 418 Squadron achieved the highest  scores in RCAF history, with 105 aircraft destroyed in the air, 74 on the  ground, 9 probables, 103 damaged and 83 V-1s destroyed.  Not bad for planes  built of Ecuador balsa, Alaska spruce, Canadian birch and fir, and English  ash, often by furniture makers.  The twin engine Mosquito had a crew of  two, but it carried the same weight of bombs as a B-17 and could fly at 400  miles an hour.<br /> Granted, McIntosh volunteered for the RCAF. He  schemed to get into 418 City of Edmonton squadron, which flew night  intruder missions.  He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, one of  Canada's highest awards for valor.  He wasn't looking for a safe and  comfortable seat to sit out the war.  Most veterans who've been in actual  combat have little to say; those who do talk often emphasize the humor.  One of their favorite songs had the lines, \\"When the compass course is  west, that's the time that I love best\\"  --  in other words, heading home,  away from the enemy.  It's little wonder he took until 1980 to write this  book.<br /> It's a different kind of war memoir.  Americans brag, Brits  keep a stiff upper lip, Germans are betrayed heroes, Russians are `zhlobi'  --  crude and uncouth.  Canadians are like hockey players in a power play  on the goal  --  all of the above, and then some.  It has the same mood as  `The Corvette Navy' by J. B. Lamb, the loneliness of fighting men who are  trivialized by everyone not in combat.  Only the Canadian military trains  \\"zombies.\\"  There's a common feeling the government compromises anything to  avoid upsetting anyone on the home front  --  an attitude American soldiers  didn't acquire until the Vietnam.<br /> Sidney Seid, a San Francisco Jew  who joined the RCAF before Pearl Harbour, was the driver (pilots were never  called pilots) for McIntosh.  Seid loyally stayed with the Canadians even  though he could have doubled his pay by in the US forces.  It wasn't an  easy life.  McIntosh tells of one crew that spent its ops circling off the  coast of Holland, afraid to cross into enemy territory, faking complete  combat reports including targets visited, burning bombers, fires, weather,  the whole thing.  It was one way to cope with the terror of facing the  enemy.<br /> Canadian aircrews flew operations, or \\"ops.\\" The American  \\"missions\\" sounded too much like a crusade.  On one occasion, on night ops  over Holland, McIntosh and his driver suddenly heard a English voice in  their earphones, \\"Waggle your wings . . .  or you'll burn.\\"  The driver  waggled.  Wildly.  \\"OK, son\\" the voice added. A British night fighter had  found them in the dark;  had they been caught by a German plane, they  wouldn't have heard the bullets hit.<br /> No wonder McIntosh was scared.  But, as he told an army friend just back from the D-Day landings, \\"At least  when I'm shot at I can run away at 400 miles an hour.\\"  His friend replied,  \\"Hell, that's nothing, you should see me.\\"  Yet, for more than 41 ops  --  if they were chasing Buzz Bombs, or only went a short distance over Europe,  it was only half an op  --  they went back again and again.<br /> Any  veteran will sympathize.  Non veterans can only wonder how they did it.<br />  McIntosh, who became a Canadian Press reporter after the war,presents a  vivid story of the deadly realities of war.  It's too good of a story ever  to be made into a movie; but then, life is generally far better than any  movie.  So is this book.war, presents a  vivid story of the deadly realities of war.

It had to be downtown, which has the highest crime rate in the city including a murder rate that is eight times the national average. The  chief librarian wanted a big box, \\"a warehouse for books.\\"  Only limited  funds were available, and budgets were being trimmed for a library system  that circulates more books for less money than any other city in the  nation.<br /> Phoenix itself is a \\"branch plant\\" town where out-of-state  businesses build box-like factories for semi-skilled workers who assemble  products.  The major media are owned by out-of-state companies.  The  university is famed as one of the top party schools in the nation.  The  crime rate is among the highest in the nation, social services are among  the lowest, the traditional architectural style is the strip mall and the  modern version is faux theme park, while urban sprawl spreads faster than  ragweed.  The library site is between a parking lot and the lush green  lawns of a city park.<br /> This may sound familiar other hard-pressed  city officials.<br /> It's a classic case of downtown urban renewal.  Dozens of cities have faced similar challenges, and many have renovated old  neighborhoods and historic districts.  In Phoenix, the decision was to  build a state-of-the-art library as one of the crown jewels needed to  revive the downtown.<br /> The new library is primarily due to the  leadership of an outstanding mayor  --  Terry Goddard  --  who recognized  the importance that quality means to civic pride.  The result is that  Phoenix architect Will Bruder built one of the outstanding new libraries in  the nation.  This book is primarily photographs and drawings, showing how  it came to be and what it is today.  It will inspire any public official  faced with the need to do a lot more with less, and to do it with beauty.  It shows that outstanding civic quality is possible despite sometimes  severe budget limitations, and that signature buildings can be built  without raiding the public treasury.<br /> The east and west sides are  clad in copper, one of the four C's on which Arizona was founded  --  copper, cotton, citrus and climate.  South side windows are shaded by  adjustable louvres, for protection against temperatures that can reach 122  degrees.  North windows use fabric sails to cut the glare.  Twelve inch  thick concrete walls shade the main portion of the building, soaking up  heat during the day and allowing it to dissipate easily at night instead of  soaking into the building.<br /> The fifth floor Reading Room was  inspired, at least in part, by the Frank Lloyd Wright design of the Johnson  Wax Building which features tall columns that flare out at the top like  lily pads.  Bruder did something different;  he designed tall columns that  taper toward the top like massive dinner candles, with a circular skylight  above each. The columns are laced together with a network of cables on  which the roof floats, free of the walls and the columns.  The atmosphere  is like being out of doors.<br /> In Bruder's words, the library embodies  his core philosophy \\"that real architecture exists when both pragmatism and  poetry are served with equal passion.\\"<br /> This book expresses it  well.  It shows what a community can accomplish when civic officials are  willing \\"to think outside the box.\\"  Civic officials contemplating a major  project, whether they have ample budgets or not, will find this book is an  inspiration to soar above mediocrity.tions, and that signature buildings can be built  without raiding the public treasury.<br /> The east and west sides are  clad in copper, one of the four C's on which Arizona was founded  --   copper, cotton, citrus and climate.

US	49694975	R3N7P4P4EDHNVX	1550547240	313100067	The Immortal Beaver: The World's Greatest Bush Plane	Books	5	35	37	N	Y	He got d' Beaver Fever	All aircraft are good, or else they wouldn't land safely;  only a few become legends, such as the Douglas DC - 3 and the de Havilland Beaver, the world's greatest bush plane built in Canada at Downsview, Ontario, from  1947 to 1967.<br />  The Beaver was a typically Canadian project, it is  rugged, reliable, durable and practical for people who were haulers of  water and hewers of wood.  It is the haul-anything, go-anywhere pickup  truck of the air; similar to their earthbound brothers before they became  \\"sport utility vehicles\\" that are too genteel to stray from perfect  pavement.  The Beaver is 30 feet long, with a 48 foot wingspan, cruises at  125 miles an hour with a 1,500 pound payload  --  and weighs less than most  SUVs.<br /> Phil Garratt, longtime head of DHC, created the Beaver.  Think  of him as an original Sam Walton with an MBWA degree  --  management by  walking around  --  long before Walton.  Garratt didn't like rules, titles  or organization charts.  His favorite expression was, \\"You know what you're  here for, go do it.\\"  The people who designed and built the first Beaver  were like the dot com pioneers of the Internet who became legendary for  living on pizza and Pepsi and working around the clock.  Under Garratt,  there were no time clocks.  When workers came late, they worked late.  If  Sunday was needed for work, then Sunday was a work day.  Garratt knew he  was building the world's best bush plane, he inspired that vision.  People  who create exciting new projects sometimes don't rest even on the seventh  day.<br /> Sean Rossiter captures the mood and spirit of de Havilland  Canada.  This isn't a dull, dry, `how I built an airplane' book, it's a  story of teamwork, spirit, confidence and fun.  When I worked in Test  Flight at DHC in the 1960's, it was a company filled with pride, legends  and humor.  Many stories seemed too fanciful to be true, but most turned  out to be solid fact.  Rossiter presents facts, stories, legends and with  typical Canadian spirit includes the humor.  It is a superb book.<br /> In  the final analysis, when you look at anything worthwhile, people make the  difference.  In Canada, just after World War II, there was a glowing  confidence that anything could be done.  A few miles away at Malton,  Canadians built the Avro Jetliner which first flew in 1949.  Since neither  Canada nor the world needed 1,692 superlative bush planes,  most were built  for military use.  The US bought 980 Beavers, the first foreign planes  bought in peacetime by both the US Army and Air Force.  The US didn't buy  any Jetliners, thus only the one was built (there's an attitude in Canada  that if the US doesn't buy a product, then it's not worth buying).<br />  The last Beaver was built in 1967,  Canada's Centennial Year.  The English  owners of DHC closed the production line because the inventory had  increased to a couple of unsold aircraft.  Today, 53 years after the  Beaver's first flight, a thousand or more are still flying. How do you  justify making more if they won't wear out?<br /> Several firms in Canada  and the US refurbish used Beavers, and some will still fly 50 years from  now.  These survivors aren't pampered pets of millionaires, carefully  tucked into air conditioned hangers; they fly every day over some of the  world's most rugged terrain. A century is a long time for the commercial  life of any aircraft;  but hundreds of Beavers may achieve it.<br />  They're like the Model T Ford, the DC-3, the World War II Jeep  --  the  best ever built for a specific purpose.  But, the world moves on.  Today,  people want a Lincoln Navigator, a Boeing 737, or a Hummer.  Yet, a first  love lingers long.  One of Canada's best bush plane operators summed up the  widespread love of pilots and passengers for this plane, \\"He got d' Beaver  fever.\\"<br /> They couldn't have been built in any country but Canada, and  Rossiter nicely sums up this immortal plane and the unforgettable  characters who made it so.  Read it, and catch some of \\". . . d' Beaver  fever.\\"o.  Read it, and catch some of \\". . . d' Beaver  fever.\\"	2000-05-25
US	49694975	R28S2K00LZJB5H	0156656051	441663101	Night Flight (Harbrace Paperbound Library, Hpl63)	Books	4	49	59	N	N	The nature of duty	Sitting in the co-pilot's seat of a King Aire over western New Mexico a few years ago, I was eager to see the 11,301 foot high Mt. Taylor where a TWA flight had crashed in the 1930's, killing everyone on board.<br />  It's hard to understand how anyone can run into a lone mountain rising a  mile above the otherwise flat Colorado Plateau.  Surely one could go  around, or over, or do anything but hit it.  Yet, \\"flying blind\\" was a  deadly hazard of early aviation.<br /> This book is really about the  decisions of men who send others to face danger.  It doesn't have a happy  ending.  One pilot, his radio operator, and plane simply vanish.  Others  are on schedule, and the system operates without pause.  It's a reflection  on the nature of imposed duty, a contrast to today's voluntary acceptance  of risk.<br /> Saint Exupery wrote a few years after Charles Lindbergh  made the first solo flight across the Atlantic.  Aviation progress then  rested very much on the courage of pilots, which is why Lindbergh was such  a hero.  He typified the American spirit, \\"the lone eagle\\" accepting great  personal risk to be first.  `Night Flight' is the opposite side of the  coin, it deals with the willingness of men to order others to endure great  risk for a new venture.<br /> Weather's bad?  In Saint Exupery's words,  \\"if you only punish men enough, the weather will improve.\\"  Pilot's afraid?  For the supervisor, \\"a man was a mere lump of wax to be kneaded into  shape.\\"  Everyone is trapped within an impersonal system that leaves the  supervisor without one confidant, and pilots facing instant death in the  pitch black tumbling winds of a storm.<br /> In the 1930's, aviation was  the cutting edge of high tech.  Today, it's electronics. Sure, in our dot  com society, people risk their health, sanity, careers and families to the  relentless demands of the system.  However, risk takers are now volunteers.  If they win, they share mightily in the profits.  If they lose, with their  career scattered like little bits of broken aircraft metal across a harsh  landscape, they're invited to try again \\"because of what you've learned  from your last failure.\\"<br /> Progress always involves risk.  Saint  Exupery examines the need to risk others for the benefit of society.  He  treats it with sympathy, understanding, compassion and a view that is  touching and yet as impersonal and relentless as a storm.  It's \\"fate,\\" as  people have said for thousands of years.<br /> Over New Mexico, the King  Aire automatic pilot clicked off the tenths of a mile, accurate to within a  few feet because of Global Positioning Satellites.  Radar scanned the sky  for any hazard;  on the proper setting, it even shows rain in nearby  clouds.  Finally I asked, \\"Where's Mount Taylor?\\"<br /> \\"Down there,\\" the  pilot answered. It was 10,000 feet, about two miles below.  It's hard to  comprehend an airliner of the 1930's flying blindly into a mountain, when  positions are now known to within a few feet.  Saint Exupery paints a  brilliant portrait of that earlier era, framed in a discussion of the  duties of bosses who order employees to do extraordinary work.<br /> It's  not a management book, nor a call for workers' rights; it's a fundamental  discussion of the oldest problem in human relations  --  How do I order  someone to take risk?  Today, much risk is voluntary.  Societies with  people ready, willing, capable and the guts to accept risk become economic  leaders.  It's why Amazon dot com exists; launched by a man with the guts  to risk the money  --  no longer the lives  --  of others to create an  entirely new way of doing business.<br /> `Night Flight' is based on a  simple premise, \\"No guts, no glory.\\"  The nature of risk has changed, but  it's as applicable now as in 1932 when this book was first published.  Anyone who thinks about the duty of management will find this book  interesting.r scattered like little bits of broken aircraft metal across a harsh  landscape, they're invited to try again \\"because of what you've learned  from your last failure.\\"<br /> Progress always involves risk.

This book is about a man who spent his  professional life assessing people and situations, and thus is not afraid  to make tough decisions.  In Russia, for the immediate future, tough  decisions are needed.<br /> Putin's hero, Czar Peter the Great, used his  regal power to make Russia a great, rich and powerful nation.  Putin  intends to provide similar dynamic leadership with democratic principles.  An example may be Singapore, a mix of authority, discipline and  prosperity.<br /> The question-and-answer format of this book is based on  six four-hour interviews by three journalists.  Putin  admits he was, \\". .  . a pure and utterly successful product of Soviet patriotic education.\\"  He  was smart, dedicated, hard-working and very good in his chosen career with  the KGB.  He wasn't a old cloak-and-dagger \\"sneak and peek\\" spy;  he spent  his time reading reports, assessing East German officials and skillfully  pushing paper.<br /> Trained as a lawyer, he was appalled at how Communist  officials assumed they were the law simply because they were Party members.  Putin was never a dissident, he was the ultimate Organization Man whose  goal was a richer, happier, stronger and freer Russia.  He worked hard to  become an insider, and as such saw the total incompetence of the Party.<br />  His wife says, \\"He always lived for the sake of something.  There are some  people who work hard for money, but he works hard for ideas.\\"  When first  married, they had a 10-foot by 12-foot room in his parents' 275-square foot  apartment.  Try and think of any American president since Lincoln  --  another idea man  --  who lived in any similar conditions.<br /> Like  Lincoln, whose greatest idea was \\"to preserve the Union,\\" the prime  challenge for Putin is to preserve Russia.  His practical experience taught  him that a free market economy is far superior to the chaos, conniving and  cronyism of communism.  He says the Soviets failed because they \\". . . had  a terminal disease without a cure  --  a paralysis of power.\\"<br /> Two  things are clear;  Putin is not afraid to act, and he will never betray  Russia.  He learned from his father's World War II experience, \\". . . there  are always a lot of mistakes made in war.  That's inevitable.  But when you  are fighting, if you keep thinking that everybody around you is always  making mistakes, you'll never win.  You have to take a pragmatic attitude.\\"  He approaches life in that fashion.<br /> His political heroes also  rebuilt shattered nations.  Charles DeGaulle saved France from itself;  while in Germany, Ludwig Erhard succeeded because \\". . . his entire  conception for the reconstruction of the country began with the creation of  new moral values for society.\\"  The Soviet collapse created a similar  challenge for Putin. This book explains what his \\"effective authority\\" is  all about.  It's the best book available this year about a politician with  new ideas.<br /> This is a refreshingly candid portrait  of the soul of  the new President of Russia, a fascinating contrast to \\"personality  politics\\" that mask any inner feelings of American politicians.  Putin  trusts the Russian people enough to be honest;  our politicians hire spin  doctors to create \\"centrist\\" or \\"moving to the right\\" or \\"compassionate  conservative\\" images.  The contrast is ominous.<br /> Then, stop and  think.  Does America really need tough, effective authority?  Or are we  better off with superficial candidates and trivial issues?  If Putin  succeeds, he will outdo Peter the Great.  In America, do we need a great  crusade?  or merely to be left alone?  Another Lincoln?  or a Shrub?o be left alone?  Another Lincoln?  or a Shrub?	2000-05-22

I  know, I've tried it.  A full day's work produces only a small image.  First, find a hard river stone with a pointy end;  then, spend hours using  it to chip away enough desert varnish and surface rock to make a shallow  indent on a large boulder or cliff face.  When you finish, since rocks  don't rot or grow back, the design will last thousands of years.<br />  Rock art wasn't doodles or graffiti, churned out in a trivial moment or so;  it is serious statements of faith that Native Americans took days or weeks  to produce.  The original meanings may never be recovered, which is a great  loss;  but, the artistry can still be appreciated.  Patterson's sketches  are clear, concise and free of unrelated static.  Since petroglyphs are the  originals of modern Native American art, this is also a guide for artists,  historians and poets of the Southwest.<br /> It is a bilingual dictionary,  everything from \\"arrow\\" and \\"atlatl\\" to \\"X-ray styles.\\"  In Spanish, it  helps to know \\"Alto\\" means \\"Stop;\\"  in the petroglyph language, it helps to  know what sign means \\"Sun.\\"  Patterson offers educated insights into 600  common petroglyphs.  People today link certain symbols to ideas, such as an  \\"apple\\" as a gift for a teacher, a still life art object, a kind of pie, or  a computer.  In all likelihood, every petroglyph had as many or more  meanings  --  depending on the story teller.<br /> Consider Patterson's  description of the sun sign, which is still a popular design for silver  jewelry from the Pueblos:  \\". . . the outer circle represents the ring of  light around the Sun, the second represents the sun itself, and the inner  circle or dot, his umbilicus, which opens to provide mankind with game and  other sustenance.\\"  Next, think of modern artists who see the sun and paint  a yellow circle, while others paint a yellow circle and create a sun.  Now,  the petroglyph sun sign takes on new meaning.<br /> Art expresses a sense  of adventure.  A thousand years ago, petroglyphs were patiently chipped  into boulders and cliffs to create a permanent memory of unique and special  events.  They portray a dramatic history of gods, demons, giants,  tricksters and rare events as powerful and devious and clever as any Nordic  saga. They also offer maps to the beginning of creation and pathways to a  fulfilled life.  Petroglyphs are a record of the exploration, knowledge and  interpretation of America long before its \\"discovery\\" by Europeans.  It  reminds us that we have much yet to understand;  it may not be the \\"Rosetta  stone\\" of the Southwest, but it is one of the texts.<br /> This is a  masterful guide, sensibly devoid of guesswork and idle speculation (that's  my field).  Every society invents, discovers, experiments and creates to  explain its origins and values.  Patterson classifies common themes that  were important enough to be written on rock.

The fundamental reason for the public distrust and contempt for the news media is amply evident in this 96-page book analyzing coverage of the Lewinsky-Clinton affair  --  Americans have never tolerated a \\"holier than  thou\\" attitude from anyone.<br /> Now, don't get me wrong.  This is a  great book.  It covers a recent major story and all of the hazards of  reporting;  in fact, it is what the print media does best when it  investigates and reports controversey with depth, detail, discernment and  presumed accuracy.  But, after reading it, you'll understand why President  Clinton continues to be popular and why the media is so reviled.<br />  Clinton regularly apologizes for his mistakes.  The media, even when  egregiously wrong, never apologizes.  It brings to mind a McNaught  Syndicate \\"Grafitti\\" cartoon from the 1960's, \\"An editor isn't always right  but he's never wrong.\\"  In other words, never accuse an editor of a  mistake;  instead, explain \\"Here's some added details that would have led  you to a different conclusion had you had it beforehand.\\"<br /> `Warp  Speed' piously quotes Walter Lippman's observation that a journalist's role  \\". . . is to sift out rumor and innuendo from fact and publish what one  believes are facts.\\"  It ignores the common newsroom view that \\". . . an  editor's job is to separate the wheat from the chaff, then print the  chaff.\\"  It may be somewhat cynical, but if the media were as cynical about  their own performance as they are about the performance of everyone else  they would be held in much higher regard.<br /> It reminds me of news  coverage about the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbour.  The media got  the basic story right; but, most details in early stories were muddled,  incomplete, inaccurate or even fanciful.  That's expected in the fog and  confusion of war.  The Lewinsky-Clinton coverage was equally muddled,  incomplete, inaccuratre and fanciful.  That's to be expected in the fog and  confusion of politics and instant news coverage.<br /> The difference in  today's world is the willingness of the media to rigorously investigate  itself, which is about as objective as a church investigating the sins of  its priests.  Yet, a flawed watch dog is better than no dog at all.  In  this case, the investigating \\"dogs\\" are from Harvard and Columbia  universities  --  which style themselves as the College of Cardinals of  journalism.  It's like asking the Attorney General to investigate the  President.  Okay, \\"Who watches the flawed dogs?\\"<br /> Two hundred and  some years ago, the founders established a House and a Senate to provide  \\"sober second judgment.\\"  It's part of the checks-and-balances of our  society.  Today, the House and Senate are run by political parties  --  and  the media provides the \\"sober second judgment\\" from city hall to the  presidency.  If it's \\"political,\\" most people know it has little merit;  if  it's policy, the media highlights the issues.  Who do you think has  uncovered every major scandal of the past 25 years?<br /> Barry Goldwater  once called Richard Nixon the most dishonest man he ever met.  The  salacious details of the Lewinsky-Clinton affair were backdrop for whether  or not \\"Bunco Billy\\" is now trying for the title.  A politician accusing  someone of lying is \\"politics.\\"  When the reputable media raises the same  issue, it's good investigative journalism.  Remember, Goldwater didn't  comment until the media proved it to be true.<br /> It's a welcome trend.  Had the media investigated the Bay of Pigs or Tonkin Gulf resolution, we  would have been spared much grief.  This book is a great start in  self-criticism.  The media investigating the media?  Sure.  First question:  \\"How many professions can be trusted to investigate themselves?\\"  Second  question:  \\"How many will investigate themselves?\\"<br /> Okay, who better  to investigate the media?  If the media can't investigate itself, then what  can we trust it to investigate?  By the end of this book, the media looks  pretty good.  Not because of the Lewinsky-Clinton reporting, but for this  investigation.  It's a fascinating inside look at \\"news values.\\"  They can  be improved, but still, the media is refreshingly open to outside  scrutiny.<br /> So, who really investigates the media?

US	49694975	R30NZQM4QENO24	0670885517	700763528	The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory	Books	5	8	11	N	N	The soul of America	This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the real \\"soul\\" of the United States and its military future; it's not just a history of the Battle of New Orleans, it's also a primer for the debate about the future of the American military.<br /> The United States was thoroughly defeated  in the War of 1812.  By 1814, the New England economy had been destroyed  and several states were talking of secession to join Canada, Washington was  in smoldering ruins, the Navy cowering in ports and the British were  conducting search and destroy missions at will along the seacoasts.  At  Ghent, American negotiators threw in the towel and accepted the British  terms to restore everything as it had been before the war.<br /> Out of  this, Americans invented their nation.  Until then, European nations often  regarded the War of Independence as an accident.  After 1815, no one  doubted the United States.  Without the Battle of New Orleans, the United  States might have dissolved in confusion or dissension.  For the British,  it was a minor skirmish in a dismal far off swamp.  Only 291 British  soldiers were killed in the final attack, compared to 240 British soldiers  killed in the charge up Bunker Hill.<br /> After New Orleans, the British  created the greatest empire the world has ever seen.  After New Orleans,  the Americans created democracy as the world knows it today.  This nation  is a product of the resourcefulness, courage and ability shown by Gen.  Andrew Jackson at New Orleans.  Remini puts his focus on Jackson;  without  him, the Battle of New Orleans would have been a sorry repeat of the  burning of Washington.<br /> New Orleans didn't teach the British  anything.  They used the same stupid \\"charge the cannons\\" tactics in the  Crimean War, celebrated in The Charge of the Light Brigade.  In World War  I, British generals updated their New Orleans tactics to \\"charge the  machine guns.\\"  New Orleans taught the British nothing;  the War of 1812  taught Americans never to make the same mistake twice.<br /> Instead of  fat generals who were heroes of an earlier war, Americans learned the value  of military competence and professionalism.  Thirty years later, officers  trained in the War of 1812 needed less than one quarter of the troops used  in the War of 1812 to rout the Mexicans.  War is the harshest test of any  nation, and by 1815 the United States learned it could survive against the  world's finest military.  New Orleans showed they could also win smashing  victories.<br /> After the War of 1812, the United States became the de  facto partner of Great Britain in blocking further European interference in  the Americas.  Remini's descriptions of events relating to the battle are  vital;  it emphasizes the core values that made the United States what it  is today  --  and Great Britain what it is today.  It gave Americans their  wonderful confidence to always overcome any disaster and come back  stronger.  This is a wonderful book that explains the nature of the soul of  this country.<br /> Take away that self-assurance, and the United States  would have become \\"the first Balkans\\" with Serbian troops needed to keep  the peace among fractious states.  Hopefully, Professor Remini will now  expand his last four and one-half pages into another book of this length to  illustrate the lessons and myths learned from the Battle of New Orleans  --  as relevant today as they were in 1815 - 45.  The United States is now in  the position that Britain was in 1815;  in another century, the US may be  in the same position that Britain was in 1915.  That is the implicit  meaning of this book.<br /> Perhaps the finest assessment of the War of  1812 came from Thomas Jefferson when he wrote, \\"We owe to their [Britain's]  past follies and wrongs the incalculable advantage of being made  independent of them in every material manufacture.  These have taken such  root, in our private families especially, that nothing can now extirpate  them.\\"<br /> This book outlines the mood that made it so.  The decisions  of the next decade, in terms of military and civilian attitudes, will be as  significant as those made after Gen. Jackson's triumph over \\"the evil  empire\\" of his era.This book outlines the mood that made it so.

The public trusted reporters, just as it trusted presidents and auto company executives and  priests and all sorts of authority figures.<br /> Doubts began to arise in  the 1960's, with a variety of revelations.  Hugh Hefner said \\"sex is fun\\"  and people discovered he was right.  Various president's ordered hundreds  of thousands of Americans to risk their lives in Vietnam, but didn't offer  a similar national commitment.  Auto executives churned out cars that  exploded in rear-end collisions, refusing to spend a couple of dollars per  car to correct the problem.  After a president resigned  --  not before  --  Barry Goldwater called him \\"the most dishonest man I ever met.\\"<br />  Reeves seems surprised that such questioning includes the news media.  His  book is a wonderful collection of the doubts afflicting the media, and the  very valid reasons for such distrust.  Any reporter with a couple of years  experience can recount horror stories of unethical editors and publishers  who believe and act as if they are the most powerful people in the  community.  Remember the old adage, \\"If you talk to God, you're praying;  if God talks to you, you're nuts.\\"  Some editors believe, \\"If you endorse  our editorials, you're a good citizen; if you question our wisdom, you're  nuts.\\"<br /> Think of Reeves as the `Martin Luther' of journalism; his  book tacks his theses to the door of today's most arrogant institution.  In  response, the \\"Reformation\\" is here  --  it's called the Internet.<br />  Fifty years ago, in the \\"golden age\\" of journalism, some people bought a  newspaper for a single reason  --  for sports, stock tables, weather,  comics, advice columns, crossword puzzles or other single purposes.  The  rest was thrown away.  Now, the Internet provides such information directly  and with less hassle.  Newspapers will never recapture such shallow  readers.<br /> Only the media analyzes itself in full public view.  The  Catholic Church doesn't publicize the sexual liaisons of priests with young  boys  --  and, in some cases, young women.  Critics of priestly failings  are all noise and hate with no insight, wisdom or mercy;  despite that, no  priest would dare issue a book admitting, \\"We've got problems, and here's a  solution.\\"  But, the news media is its own toughest critic  --  as Reeves  shows.  The Janet Cooks and Duke Tullys are national embarrassments  featured by the media to deter others from making similar mistakes.<br />  Reeves criticizes the media with insight, mercy and rational analysis;  he  avoids egregious examples and partisan twaddle.  Read the Wall Street  Journal  and The New York Times  every day for a few weeks, and you'll  understand how \\"truth\\" is so variable.  Both offer vigorous, intelligent  and often opposite editorial opinions by highly intelligent writers;  it's  what happens in a free society.  Only tyrannies celebrate consensus,  conformity and conservatism.  The fault is not with opinions, it is with  mealy-mouth publishers who think circulation depends on being so bland that  the paper is \\"everyone's friend.\\"<br /> The grimmest fault of the media is  the oldest story in the world, \\"No guts, no glory.\\"  When you have gutless  publishers, reporters become equally gutless  --  and the public deserts to  \\"bold new media\\" such as the Internet.  Sadly, Reeves failed to suggest a  solution.  Quite simply, take a theme from his favorite movie, The Front  Page  (1931 version),  and get editors back to the three-martini breakfast  and a gin bottle in the bottom desk drawer  --  you can buy courage by the  quart, if that's what it takes to give them guts.<br /> Respect isn't  earned by licking every boot in the community, it comes from a basic  principle of old fashioned journalism, \\"Comfort the afflicted, and afflict  the comfortable.\\"  Sure, it takes guts.  Maybe it's why Reeves, brilliant  at outlining problems, fails to offer solutions.  After all, someone may  challenge him with a better idea.  Remember, he's one of the professors who  train modern journalists.<br /> That is his only weakness.  His book is a  wonderful analysis of problems facing conscientious journalists, probably  the best in the recent spate of criticism.  First, read it; then, disagree  with my analysis.  See?  You're already on the road to a solution.lliant  at outlining problems, fails to offer solutions.  After all, someone may  challenge him with a better idea.

He's a bold new thinker who is not afraid of new ideas.   This book offers the first new idea in socialism  since the start of the Industrial Revolution  --  one new idea in 200 years  certainly isn't going to overload any socialist's neural circuits.<br />  From Canada to Zambia, and all little lands inbetween, socialism collapsed  because it operated on the same basis as unregulated capitalism  --  Greed  is Enough.  Greed is the heart of free enterprise, as Marx said, but it  accomplished more in its first century than mankind did in all previous  human history.  Socialists didn't question this principle;  capitalists got  rich, socialists wanted the riches of the capitalists.  Samuel Gompers  summed it up nicely, workers wanted \\"More, more, more.\\"  Leftists spent 200  years trying to get more from the capitalists, and usually failed  miserably.<br /> Singer uses the first half of his book to demolish old  socialist assumptions, pointing out that even in the 1870's the anarchists  (today's Libertarians) proved communism could not work.  But, anarchists  got a bad name.  Instead of heeding their ideas, half of the world  experimented with various degrees of socialism while the other half tried  naked greed.<br /> The second half calls for altruism to humanize the  opportunism of the \\"Greed is enough\\" idea.  Will it work?  Only 6 percent  of people donate to blood banks  --  a truly altruistic action since donors  do not know the recipients  --  yet, this is a valuable part of our  society.  Charitable gifts often go to unknown recipients, such gift s are  to \\"help others\\" rather than a specific person.<br /> Until now, as Singer  writes, \\"Belief in the malleability of human nature has been important for  the Left because it has provided grounds for hoping that a very different  kind of human society is possible.\\"  His response:  Wrong.  Instead of  trying the change human nature, Singer wants Leftists to accept human  nature as it is  --  such as the inborn spirit of altruism,  the  willingness to help others without expecting a reward.<br /> He stands  firmly on the side of the weak, poor and oppressed.  Instead of handouts or  simply taking \\"more\\" from the rich, Singer believes, \\"most people will  respond positively to genuine opportunities to enter into mutually  beneficial forms of cooperation.\\"  Instead of propping up the rich or  arbitrarily redistributing wealth, government should \\"Promote structures  that foster cooperation rather than competition, and attempt to channel  competition into socially desirable ends.\\"<br /> What is this in practical  terms?  For example,  celebrate the fact that Amazon dot com is the best  idea in selling books since the paperback  -- the government shouldn't  interfere with Jeff Bezos' brilliance.  But, if Bezos' comes up with a new  cooperative venture  --  suppose he can vastly improve the effectiveness of  Habitat for Humanity  --  then the government should say \\"Right On!\\" and  provide whatever help is appropriate.  Let's encourage cooperation, as we  now subsidize existing businesses.<br /> Singer doesn't suggest anything  as specific as this.  Instead, he outlines a new idea that celebrates  riches and will effectively help the weak, poor and oppressed.  In other  words, \\"You can have your cake, and here's how we can get some for others  too.\\"<br /> His idea is great.   It already works in hundreds of little  ways.  If adopted, thousands of pages of other books will be written to  explore the details.  If not  . . . well, think of the miserable century  the world endured for rejecting anarchist views of the futility of  communism.  It's the idea that is important, not the personality behind the  idea.<br /> Singer's book offers two themes;  30 pages to explain why the  old socialism failed, and 33 pages to outline a new altruism.  It's a pure  idea, unembellished with pagesand pages of examples and larded with  tedious philosophy.

Lamb was one of those men, and he has written a superb story about  `The Corvette Navy' of Canada which helped fight the U-boats to a  stand-still in World War II.  Corvettes were rugged little ships, about 200  feet in length and only 1,200 tons, based on the design of Antarctic  whaling ships.  Almost 300 were built, the largest number of any one class  of warships ever built.  England's Royal Navy named them for flowers;  which meant the proud Teutonic U104 was sunk by HMS Rhododendron, and U147  was sunk by HMS Periwinkle, and U605 was captured by HMS Poppy.  It was  truly &quot;flower power&quot; in action.<br /> Canadians named their  corvettes after towns, and let crews design the coat-of-arms for each ship.  Five aces were chosen for HMCS Baddeck (bad deck -- get it?);  a crowned  lady falling on her backside in a puddle of water became the crest for HMCS  Wetaskiwin (Wet-ass-Queen).  Lamb, one of the top newspaper editors in  Canada during his career, includes the courage, duty, sacrifice, terror  and, thankfully  --  the humor that war can provide.  Lamb lived that  experience, as commander of HMCS Minas and later HMCS Camrose.  His book is  a first hand account.<br /> The winter North Atlantic, where Canadian  corvettes took convoys to and from England, is one of the grimmest bodies  of water on earth.  Fall into the sea, and you lose consciousness within  five minutes and freeze to death within 15 minutes.  Lamb tells of frantic  work by corvette crews to chop foot thick ice of the upper decks to keep  from rolling over and sinking.  He also tells of a depth charge attack  against a U-boat by a trawler which couldn't get away from the explosions  in time.  Geysers of water erupted and the trawler disappeared under the  spray;  when it reappeared with it's stern blown off and steam pouring from  broken boiler pipes, the captain meekly signaled, \\"I have busted  myself.\\"<br /> Even Americans, who got into the war two and one-quarter  years after Canada, are included.  Lamb was once part of a crew bringing a  new Canadian warship from British Columbia to the North Atlantic.  The  Americans posted an armed guard with a massive gun on his hip to prevent  any \\"monkey business\\" while in the Panama Canal.  Canadian ships in those  days issued a daily tot of rum to every sailor; so the guard was plied with  food and extra rum.  After he fell asleep in his chair, the Canadian  sailors slipped the revolver out of the man's holster and replaced it with  a banana.<br /> When the fun was over, they gave a very worried guard his  beloved gun back before they left him in Colon, Panama.  In a few months,  the Canadians were in the toughest combat theatre of World War II; the  American was left to keep Panama safe.  It's this combination of the  sublime to the ridiculous  --  how else do you expect teenagers in warships  to act?  -- that makes his book a rare gem in military histories.  Without  such kids, U-boats could have closed the Atlantic  --  and Germany might  have won.  Understand them, and you'll understand the mood of American  service men in World War II.<br /> Who were these sailors?  Look at it  this way:  anyone who was 30 years of age or older was immediately  nicknamed  \\"Pappy.\\"  The regular peacetime navy men all got safe desk jobs  in Canada or England;  just as the old Spartans sat at home and sent the  teens to Thermopylae.  Wars are ever like that, and Lamb tells their story  superbly.  Only one corvette now remains, as a dockside museum in Halifax.  Lamb's book heralds the passing of an fantastic era lived by incredible  men.<br /> Even if you've never seen a ship, let alone the North Atlantic  Squadron, you'll understand this story that's told in terms of the people.  It's a gem.nderstand this story that's told in terms of the people.   It's a gem.	2000-04-26

First came \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town\\" in 1912, which established Stephen Leacock as Canada's leading humorist.  Leacock wrote about various individuals in Orillia, but he took pains to point out that his \\"Mariposa\\" was typical of many small towns.  Richmond emphasizes \\"the civic spirit\\" that inspires and shapes a community.  For example, it was no accident that Orillia was the first community in the Americas to adopt Daylight Saving Time.<br /> If it was progressive, new and scientific in 1912, Orillia was for it.  Mayor \\"Daylight Bill\\" Frost, whose son Leslie Frost was Prime Minister of Ontario in the 1950's, vigorously promoted the new idea for \\"The Town Ahead.\\" It prompted the inevitable laughs, \\"Do you go on God's Time or Bill Frost's time?\\" As still happens to countless people, when the \\"Leap Ahead\\" day came, Daylight Bill forgot to set his clock ahead and got church an hour late the next morning.  The idea soon collapsed in chaos -- but, it became a national policy during World War I.<br /> Orillia became a leading town in many ways.  It pioneered the long-distance transmission of electric power, produced Tudhope Automobiles until the outbreak of war in 1914, erected one of the world's finest statues of the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, and helped begin the Canadian tradition of humor with one of the finest comedy troupes that entertained troops during the war.  One of the world's first health insurance plans began in Orillia; and the Soldier's Memorial Hospital was built to provide perpetual free medical care for every Orillia area veteran.  The list goes on and on.<br /> Richmond looks at \\"why\\" it all happened.  It's what he calls \\"the Orillia Spirit,\\" which has ebbed and flowed for the past 125 years.  Orillia collapsed in the 1920's and by the 1950's, wages were among the lowest in the province.  When Thomson Newspapers bought the local weekly in the 1940's, the staff trembled at the new owner's tight-fisted reputation for wages. Thomson insisted everyone had to accept Thomson wage scales, or look elsewhere.  The result was about a 25 percent wage increase for most employees.  By the 1950's, \\"new ideas\\" centered on visitors who could make clouds \\"disappear\\" through mental power alone.  By 1962, preparing Orillia's (and Canada's) Centennial in 1967, town officials tore down the original brick and limestone village meeting hall that had been built in 1867.<br /> As happens with many failing towns, the attitude \\"do as Daddy did\\" was considered enough to restore prosperity. It's all here; the brilliance and cooperation that creates an outstanding community or company, plus the bickering, infighting and pettiness that brings collapse.  The incidents in the \\"Orillia Spirit\\" will remind anyone of similar faults or greatness in their own situation; once such folly is recognized, it is much easier to confront and correct or flee and forget.  All this is woven into a well written account of how a small town with a Spanish name grew, thrived, failed, and is still bickering into the 1990's.<br /> In so doing, Richmond avoids the pitfalls of most \\"local\\" history. His writing is fresh, comfortable, clear and informative.  I know, I started an Orillia history in the 1960's and had I stayed would have produced a dense, dull, detailed and unreadable manuscript.  Richmond made none of those mistakes, which makes his book a fascinating story of a small town and a perfect example for anyone interested in writing a history of their town or company.t 125 years.
