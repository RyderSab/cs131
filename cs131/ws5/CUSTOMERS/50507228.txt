US	50507228	RHDPFOGZSUJAL	0452282969	341415707	Ordinary Horror	Books	1	3	3	N	N	Frustrating in the extreme	Hmm.  This book purports to be a thriller and for a while it manages.  An old man with a gopher problem buys some mysterious plants from a newspaper ad that claim to be \\"antithetical to garden varmints but harmless to everything else\\".  Then mysteriously all the pets disappear from the neighborhood and both the old man and the little girl next door have an unshakeable feeling of impending doom.<br /><br />Alright, that's fine for a start.  The problem is, that's about three quarters of the book right there.  The style is so SLOW.  It's not slow meaning boring.  But it kept taking so long for anything to happen.  It drove me nuts!!  For example, the little girl calls the old man in the middle of the night and asks him to come over because \\"the dog in her room is moving\\".  (The impending doom was explained to the girl as \\"a very bad dog.\\"  It was creepy.)  So the old man says he'll come over in the morning.  Then the next day he spends pages and pages flipping through old photographs of his wife!  Not going over to the neighbours' to progress the story line.<br /><br />The whole book is like that.  If it had been told concisely it would be a novella and one quarter the size it is now.  As it is, it is slow and frustrating and ultimately comes to no kind of resolution anyway.  Very frustrating.	2005-06-24

Admittedly, it has sat on my shelf for three years, waiting until I was in a suitably dark mood to be tempted by it. The authors present a lot of evidence and show very thorough research. The killer they suggest seems entirely plausible, much more so than in the other Ripper book I read and enjoyed (at the end of which, the author's conclusion was that the man had simply stopped killing. Serial killers don't just stop. So that was implausible). Good book.	2005-06-20

To me, the cover looks like a girl in a prom dress, so I was expecting humorous confessions of a high school student, whereas this was essays from a thirty-something somewhat successful writer.  Some of the essays made me laugh out loud, but I'd say maybe only 30% of the book was funny, the rest was either stupid, boring, or sad.  It was very sad for me to see this woman with a growing career and a husband who loves her, and she still has ridiculously low self-esteem and is constantly focused on her weight.  It's depressing that should make her think so little of herself, and I'm by turns angered and saddened.	2005-05-31

I picked it up at Half Price Books and it doesn't even have an ISBN, it seems to have been printed by a small, independent press in Silverdale, WA. The drawings are fun. The story is about a thirty-something bookish type who winds up in a typical pirate-romance-adventure story as the captain of a ship. The characters are fun, the story is fun. The only thing that bugged me is that, at least at the beginning, it seemed like every time someone spoke they were cut off or interrupted before they finished speaking which felt very disjointed and made it hard to get the sense of what was happening. After a while I either stopped noticing or it stopped happening. Either way I like this and plan to hang onto it for a bit.	2005-05-16

This is the first one so it contains a lot of setting-things-up. It's about a man, Alex, who sees his best friend killed and learns he has the power to possess other people and become a monster. Through one of the murderers, he exacts his vengeance and is sent to a hospital for the criminally insane. That's just the first page. Things progress from there. It was very interesting.<br /><br />It seems to have been drawn entirely on computer and the author has a way of showing people in 3/4 view so it looks as though they only have one eye, which I found very disturbing.	2005-05-04

I loved the first three of Celeste Bradley's romance novels.  They had gripping story lines, fierce chemistry, and always managed to pull my emotions into a twist as well and leave me sobbing at some point.  Her fourth was a bit of a disappointment to me.  It wasn't as gripping or as emotional as the others, but I still enjoyed it and kept it on my shelf to complement the others.  This one I was very excited to read.  It starred Lord Reardon, my favorite character from the other novels.  I knew not to expect too much because I had been dissatisfied with the previous one, but still this book was a big let-down.  The story and the characters were not so engaging.  The author's habit of pet-names began to grate.  And never were my emotions tightly involved.  I am very sad with the quality of this book.  I feel like now that the author has become successful she's gearing herself up to churn out a book every six months instead of taking her time to write something well-made.  I feel like this should be the last of her books that I read, although I'm not certain I will stick with that because I have been so drawn in to the world and characters she has created thus far.  Still, her books are getting awfully formulaic:  A man wounded in body and spirit who only needs the love of a good woman to heal him.  Bah!	2005-05-02

I must have read these four novels by Tamora Pierce at least eight times.  I loved them growing up and I love them still, although I am not nearly so pleased with her more recent work.  I'm glad that she is successful but the quality seems to have sharply fallen off.<br /><br />Anyway, this series is about a ten yr old girl named Alanna and her twin brother Thom who are being sent away to be educated.  Thom is meant to become a knight and Alanna to go to a convent school.  Neither twin is happy with the situation so they forge new letters of introduction from their father and Thom goes off to the convent/monastery to learn to become a Mage and Alanna is disguised as \\"Alan\\" and goes to the castle to become a knight.<br /><br />The books follow her adventures while at school then after she is ordained and they are so engaging and wonderful with many memorable characters not to mention a strong female role model.  I reccommend this series to anyone, but most especially anyone with a ten yr old daughter who might fall in love with these books the way I did.	2005-04-25

The first most noticeable thing about this book is the excessive use of alliteration, especially at the very beginning.  And I mean excessive.  At least two three or four word stretches with the same consonant sounds, per sentence for the beginning paragraphs.  After that it seemed to taper off but I still noticed it cropping up from time to time.<br /><br />Moving on.<br /><br />I picked this up from my local Half-Price Books because it had an intriguing cover (which has not even a remote resemblance to the story) and because it had an \\"Autographed Copy\\" sticker.<br /><br />It was an entertaining read.  It kept me reading to the very end to find out what happened, although that is really a genre-trait of mysteries.  The premise didn't quite stand up.  It is about a publisher who receives an unsigned manuscript on his desk of a novel so extraordinary and cataclysmic that it is bound to be an instant best seller, yet it works on different intellectual levels, and blah blah blah.  The problem is that this earth-shattering manuscript is not left as some vague idea in our minds.  Instead excerpts from it preface every chapter and are sprinkled throughout the book in other places as well.  Enough excerpts to tell that this would be an exceedingly boring, heavy-on-the-expository, self-indulgent thing that would hardly hold your interest all the way through much less skyrocket to the top of the New York Times Best Seller List.<br /><br />That complaint aside, it was a fine mystery.  I didn't see the ending coming the way it was eventually laid out.  I also think several of the plot twists were not fully supported, but I've certainly read worse.	2005-04-14

With her stamp of approval, I read this, and I parts of it were good. However, I did not feel any chemistry between the two main characters and tended to skim their love scenes. And apparently it is a requirement of the cowboy-romance that rape has to be involved portrayed as love, because this is the third book in which I've encountered it.  There was this side character who was really sweet and charming until he finally got alone with the girl he loved. Then he sort of kidnapped her and called her \\"mustang girl\\" because she struggled to get away as he was raping her, and he was generally creepy and forced himself on her even though she said no, and when she asked if he intended to marry her afterward he said, \\"Sorry, girl, this bronc can't be tamed.\\"  But he otherwise continued to be sweet and charming, except in his dealings with this girl when he was really really creepy. So, I won't be reading more by this author.	2005-04-04

Fight Club, Survivor, and Invisible Monsters were all good, interesting, informative.  But, like Lullaby, this book is a waste of time.  It may have one or two moments that are interesting, but mostly it is slow and boring.  It doesn't even have the fun little bits of ephemera that livened up his other novels.  He tries to include things, such as the anatomical names for liver spots and wrinkles, but that's not as much fun as how to make napalm in your bath tub, or what solvent best removes blood stains.	2004-12-29

But this is a well-written book.  The author is very good in his use of images, and the way he shows the normal people of the world to be as ugly in their love as Grenouille is in his hate.  I'm not sure I agree with the story's premise about the all-consuming power of scent, but I still recommend this book.  It is not a light read, but if you're in the mood for something a little bit weighty, this is definitely an interesting ride.	2004-11-28

I must say the cover didn't impress me all that much. (Yes, I judge books by their covers. For shame.)  It looked like one of a series, and said \\"A Wanda Mallory Mystery\\" in the corner, but apparently it is the first of the series. It was fun, and I'm definitely going to seek out the next in the series, if there was a next. Also, this was printed in 1991, and I liked that in this book, unlike the Stephanie Plum mysteries, people's fashions don't seem dated. She mentions wearing a black Betsey Johnson dress, or an Hermes bag, but she doesn't mention hot pink and green sweatsuits, so I'm not constantly pulled out of the action by cringing at the fashion choices. I'd certainly reccommend it for a good escapist read.	2004-11-14

That's when you get to see the culmination of the different personalities and the situations they put themselves in.  The rest of the novel is a too dry tale of a man and woman having an affair and having many long scholarly discussions about the differences in their religions (she is a jew, he is a christian) and the nature of their beliefs.  Unfortunately, nothing interesting ever is said and nothing of note ever takes place.  Yawn.  A time waster.	2004-06-26

Ignore the synopsis written on the back, obviously penned by a person who's never read it.  Instead listen to me.  This book is excellent.  It's the story of a world that turns upon the strict ordering of its society, adhering to a religion founded centuries ago; a religion that elevates men and supresses women, that reveres fireflies and fears Beauty.  A strict caste system exists allowing the few to rise but only at the expense of another.  Underneath the cities of this world the heretics hide, plotting a revolt and awaiting the second coming of their saviour, said to already walk their earth.  We watch this drama unfold by following the travails of a country boy, his country wife who is thrust into the big city, and the girl he was once promised to marry who was exiled to a Cat house long ago.<br />  Witcover provides an excellent tale with a complete mythology and history which is leant an air of authenticity by loosely borrowing on tales that are familiar from our own experience.  This level of world-building is on par with and may surpass that of the Baker's Boy trilogy and is equal to the world and religion created in the Kushiel's Dart trilogy.<br />It was a fast read although a large book, and it was self-contained so I do not have to wait for or hunt down other books in a series.  Definitely recommended.	2004-06-22

Very different from what I expected. It's really good. Carol Emshwiller (the author) really gets inside the heads of her characters. The tale is told mostly from the point of view of Charley, a teenage boy who lives in a world where humans serve as steeds for a ruling class of weak-legged aliens that like to ride around on our shoulders. It's more about the bond between young Charley and an infant alien, the next in line to the alien throne, as they learn together about what it means to live under this current symbiotic(?) system.<br />Ms. Emshwiller's grasp of psychology is amazing. I especially loved it when she would step outside of Charley's head and spend a chapter from an alien's point of view, or from a different human. The way that she managed to explain the entire society in the first chapter without ever really seeming to lay it on with the exposition. She's a master. I'm definitely going to have to hunt down more of her work.	2004-04-27

And it's nice to add a weird book to your repetoire every once in a while; shake things up.  Well.  Horse Badorties, our hero, is a brain-fried crazy hippie in New York in the 70s.  In this book you get to go on his tripped out journey as he gathers the detritus of civilization, from giant hot-dog stand umbrellas to old air-raid sirens, and passes through life.  This book really just injects you into his mind.  You are him, and you get to follow his strange, ADD thought processes.  If this book delivers a lesson, it is just that Horse, strange as he is, is a survivor.  Somehow, with no dependable source of income, he manages to get everything he wants.  He gets an apartment, a trip to the inner workings of the Museum of Natural History, and a fantastic success of a Love Concert.  Horse floats through life and for him nothing ever can go wrong.  His perspective is very unique, and crazy, but none the less valuable.  Buying two music boxes from a cheap-o toy store, he walks five yards from the store and they both break.  Instead of being distressed by this, however, he is inspired.  Now they are holy objects, their tiny clockwork dancers waiting for eternity for music that will never come.  Now they play the music of Nirvana.<br />Also, you have to read this for the Dorky-Day chapter.  Trust me.  Just trust me.	2004-03-02

In fact it is not.  It is a very slow-paced story of a newspaper in a sleepy little town.

The heroine is flighty and incapable.  At the beginning of the novel she is defending her Saxon keep against Norman invaders, their fourth attempt to take her castle.  The other three attempts she easily turned away but this one is different, due solely to their brilliant leader, without whose guidance they regain their idiocy.  Our brave heroine has a clear shot at taking out Royce (the leader) with her slingshot by hitting him in his temple, which would leave him dead and her castle would be safe.  Instead, she decides to aim for his forehead, so she'll leave a scar he'll carry for the rest of his life.  And he'll win her castle.  Right.<br /><br />Later on, once she's married to him, she puts on a show of independence and spirit and self-reliance but any time she begins to express dissent he \\"swiftly kisses her, which leaves her so bemused she completely forgets what she was talking about.\\"  Gag me.<br /><br />At one point our hero is told that Nicholaa (our heroine) was married briefly.  He has no reason to doubt this information, but somehow miraculously divines it was not so.  That's a minor point, though, so I'll let it pass.  There were other flaws, such  as the strange mixture of ignorance of the period (Ms. Garwood, medieval audiences did not clap to applaud) and extensive research while not accounting for the ignorance of her audience (such as using the obscure french names of the lady's clothing and not explaining what they described).<br /><br />Of course, not all of these are the author's fault.  A large portion of my disdain rests on the editors at Pocket Books who should have caught continuity problems and anachronistic details.<br /><br />I'm not even going to go into the boorish nature of our hero and the abusive relationship between the main couple, although I will concede some of the love scenes were very well done.  Still, if you'd like to read a good romance novel, I'd recommend something by Celeste Bradley.  Excellent, plot, characters, writing and love scenes in her novels.

The idea behind it was interesting and I enjoy reading about that period in history, but the character interactions were all poorly done.  The brother/priest who comes to hear Huitzitzitl's confession is wraught with historical innacuracies.  There is no way he would have acted the way Limon has him act.  He also seems to me to be a very incompetent priest.  I kept reading this book, hoping it would get better, but it never did and in the end I was left with a feeling of discontent and that I had wasted my time.  Save yourself the trouble.

I will say, however, that after reading this book I had to go burn it in my kitchen sink.  Not in a censorship kind of way, more like a spiritually cleansing kind of way.  I know some of the older romance novels often included a rape scene as a convenient way to explain why a character lost her virtue (and therefore could continue to sleep with the hero) but the rape in this book (which does not come at the hands of the pirate) is beyond belief.  The fact that the main character is content to stay and fall in love with the man who rapes her goes against all my feminist sensibilites.  This book is a gigantic waste of time.

It should be thrown with great force.&quot;  After reading The Drowning People, I have come to understand  exactly what that means.  This profoundly disturbing and ineffectually told  novel takes 220 or so pages to get to its rather grisly point and once  gotten you'll wish it hasn't.  I had to read this for a class I respect.  Were that not the case no power on earth could have persuaded me to finish  it.  While I have read books I've disliked before, this is the first time  I've literally felt the urge to physically rip the pages from the book and  burn them immediately.  For the love of all things, RUN SCREAMING FROM  THIS BOOK!	2000-03-07
