Scott's testimony is impressive enough alone, but when it is read as one-half of a story that is completed by Kimberly's perspective, it becomes something deeper and more dramatic. For &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot; is also the story of a marriage that survived what has killed many other unions in the past: the radical, life-changing conversion of one spouse that the other does not share.<br />The Hahns' testimonies are very different. When I first perused this book, I felt that Scott's story was closest to my own (though I am not a convert, but a &quot;revert&quot;--a cradle Catholic who ran away but came back). His approach was very intellectual and based on Scripture. Dr. Hahn knows the Bible back and forth, has studied Latin, Greek and Hebrew, has earned degrees in theology, and has been exposed to the best Catholic and Protestant thinkers. In short, the man knows whereof he speaks!<br />Whenever he related how study of Scripture opened his eyes to something, I found myself getting excited because he was making so much sense. His biblical justification of infant baptism blew me away--and that was just the beginning. In &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot;, he gives very logical insights on sola fide and sola scriptura.<br />As for Kimberly Hahn, her conversion was more emotional, though this is not necessarily a bad thing! I could not relate to her in the beginning, but I lately find myself recalling _her_ words and realizing that our journeys have so much in common. Both her conversion and my reversion cut so deeply into our souls that they became agonizing. She and I have asked soul-searching questions and received insights that would never stand up to debate, but which have touched our hearts (where any true conversion/reversion takes place). <br />This may be an awfully big claim to make, but I also believe that she and I were ultimately convinced not by the clarityand logic of Catholic apologetics, but by grace working in suffering. Whoever criticizes how emotional converts can be has no idea how deep the anguish can go and has gone, or that this anguish (including Scott's own) is as much a part of conversion as detached study. <br />This was my introduction to the Hahns and now I can't get enough of them. &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot; is great, but it is curds and whey compared to what else they have churned out. <br />Please note that all this book gives is the &quot;bird's eye view&quot; of a journey that took a very long time and a great deal of study. Therefore, some essentials may have been explained vaguely or skipped all together. For the &quot;worm's eye view,&quot; one should read Dr. Hahn's other books and transcripts of his lectures. <br />I recommend &quot;Salvation History&quot; (if I remember the title correctly), a series of five lectures in which Dr. Hahn really examines God's covenants and explains how the New Testament is hidden in the Old and the Old revealed in the New. &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot; devotes only a few paragraphs to this amazing subject--the surface of which was all Dr. Hahn was able to skim, even with five hours at his disposal. From there, read the book &quot;The Lamb's Supper&quot;, which is about the Mass, something else only lightly touched in &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot;. Trust me: they're worth it!	2003-02-08
US	47316940	RGROSQHL8CGEH	0787302198	590945043	Ziska	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A Thrilling Tale	At first, &quot;Ziska: The Problem of a Wicked Soul&quot; may seem like an odd title for what is, in essence, a romance. It is perfectly appropriate, however, when one learns that the story is about the darker side of the kind of love that &quot;many waters cannot quench . . . nor can the floods drown&quot;--the only kind of love that Marie Corelli believed in.<br />The story revolves around the mysterious Princess Ziska, who captivates the set of European tourists who are escaping their continent's harsh winter, in exotic Egypt. In particular, she draws three men towards her--Denzil Murray, a Scottish highlander; Armand Gervase, a French painter; and Dr. Maxwell Dean, an English historian and Egyptologist--for very different reasons.<br />During a costume ball, she comes as her namesake, Ziska-Charmazel, a woman who lived during the reign of Amenhotep. At this point it becomes clear that she has a diabolical agenda that involves one of these three men--her Twin Soul, the reincarnation of Araxes, a great Egyptian warrior and lover of Ziska-Charmazel.<br />Corelli tells this tale beautifully. The foreshadowing is excellent and the pace never lags. She keeps the reader in total suspense until the ending--which is proper, as &quot;Ziska&quot; is a mystery story (with some juicy horror elements). Unlike her more well-known reincarnation romance, &quot;The Life Everlasting&quot;, which had a perfectly predictable ending (not necessarily a bad thing), &quot;Ziska&quot; has a conclusion that is anybody's guess.<br />It may _still_ be anybody's guess. Though this novel was written only a mere century or so ago, it is dedicated to the present incarnation of Araxes. Where _he_ is, there Ziska-Charmazel shall also be. It's a nice, spooky thought.	2002-06-15

As a child, I read \\"The Swiss Family Robinson\\" by Johann Wyss (which I enjoyed) and \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" by Daniel Defoe (no comment). Then I found this book. Now I can't enthuse enough.<br />\\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" enchanted me from the beginning. It is the story of Karana, a young girl who must adapt to a life of solitude and loneliness after the departure of her tribe and the death of her brother. Yet there is nothing fatalistic or bitter about her: she has the strength to make the most of any situation and the grace to let adversity make the most of her. <br />Scott O'Dell tells the story in first person, keeping Karana's voice simple and honest. This may be cliched, but the best description I have for his style is \\"hauntingly beautiful.\\"<br />What makes this novel different from those of Wyss and Defoe is the character's relationship to the setting. Crusoe and the Robinson family could barely look at a plant, an animal or a rock, without thinking of how they could use it to practical advantage. In this, they resemble all the hunters who, at different points in the novel, come to the island to hunt otter and never really noticed any of its natural beauty.<br />In contrast, Karana was intimate with her island. She took what she needed for food, shelter, protection, even companionship--but somehow also gave back to the island and to the ocean. She did not change her surroundings and remain unchanged herself. \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" has many themes, but my favorite is the transformation that occurs when one lives at peace with nature and with circumstance.	2002-06-05

It has sci-fi, fantasy, and occult elements. It offers some adventure, some romance, and some mystery. What is most striking, however, is that the plot is about a spiritual quest--the kind everyone feels the need to begin, sooner or later, when the world's answers no longer satisfy one's questions.<br />Marie Corelli's nameless narrator represents the seeking soul in all of us. Yet, at the beginning of the story, she appears to have given up the search. Unlike those who have never bothered to search and do not mind being in the dark, she is wasting away in mind, body and spirit. Then she meets a mysterious painter who asks to do her portrait. It is in his studio that she has her first supernatural experience, which rejuvenates her body and rekindles her need to find the answers.<br />Her first teacher is another mysterious figure, a Chaldean named Heliobas. (It is hinted in some chapters that he may be one of the identities of the Avatar known as the Comte de St. Germaine. I'm keeping an open mind.) Naturally, most of the world sees him as eccentric and frightening: his strange experiments with electricity and his radical takes on everything (including the books of the bible) make him a fascinating teacher to those who have \\"eyes to see and ears to hear,\\" but a threat to society to those who remain in the dark.<br />Here is how Corelli's writing can be so off-putting. Nobody likes thinking that he or she is in the dark about anything; yet Corelli stoutly implies that this must be so for those who do not believe in her blatantly occult themes. Then she goes on to combine occult and Christian elements, creating a bizarre form of esoteric Christianity that she presents as TRUTH.<br />Yet let's not quibble over terminology. So what if Corelli believes that the soul is literally electric and that Heaven is a great electric circle? Other writers have made similar guesses about the soul and about Heaven, using safe words like \\"love\\" or \\"light.\\" When we read that Jesus' body was electrically charged, which was why he could heal through touch, we can at least be impressed by the spunk it took to say such a thing in Victorian England. <br />Ultimately, everyone gets to write the story of his or her soul's search for God and to discover that the many different stories are just retellings of the same one. This retelling is particularly lovely, due to Corelli's descriptive and reverent style. It is with great passion that the heroine declares: \\"I desire to know why this world, this universe exists; and I also wish to prove, if possible, the truth and necessity of religion. And I think I would give my life, if it were worth anything, to be certain of the truth of Christianity.\\"<br />I don't want to reveal the reason why the novel's title is \\"Romance of Two Worlds\\", because behind it is a fascinating twist that I think all readers should discover on their own. Don't worry that the book is all dialogue and teaching, however, as the plot takes many unexpected turns.<br />Other books in what has been called the \\"Heliobas triology\\" are \\"Ardath\\" and \\"The Soul of Lilith\\". However, it is \\"The Life Everlasting\\" that is the proper continuation of \\"Romance of Two Worlds\\", as it leads our heroine to a romance of her very own.	2002-05-29

Ray DiZazzo's writing is simple and straight to the point, yet charming enough to win a smile or two.<br />The story is a parable refreshingly set in the here and now. Its central character is Gloria, an executive, wife and mother, whose relationships with an employee, her husband and her son are becoming more and more chaotic and strained. Enter Joel, who meets Gloria in her dreams and shares four basic Focal Points of communication with her. Over the next few weeks, in her waking life and her dream life, Gloria uses these Focal Points and does not just get her message across, but transforms her relationships. <br />I particularly like Joel's Clarity Monitoring System and its holographic Sender and Receiver plates. It showed me, rather than told me, how Senders and Receivers can be on such different wavelengths that a message doesn't get through alive. Showing is always better than telling, which is why this book works so well.<br />DiZazzo could have easily written the one millionth non-fiction book on effective communication . . . and bored us all to death. The short story format really does get his point across much more effectively. The situations in Gloria's life are excellent, even amusing, illustrations for his message. As they represent common problem areas in communication that many people face today (on the job _and_ at home), they speak directly to readers.<br />This is not the kind of thing I usually read, but I enjoyed it immensely. \\"The Clarity Factor\\" is magical, even sentimental, at surprising moments.	2002-05-17

It is with great fanfare that the beloved characters of former books make their last appearance.<br />All sorts of incredible developments are described in the course of the novel--and some of them fairly stretch the imagination. My favorite is the \\"emigration\\" of the whole extended family to Plumfield: Meg has a house close by, Laurie and Amy have a mansion on an adjacent hill, and even Mr. March and Mr. Laurence have become neighbors to the school. Of course, this and all the rest make the story more fun . . . but I miss the old subtlety.<br />The school itself has become a college--a convenient twist that allows the characters from \\"Little Men\\" to still be in the same area years after they ought to have moved away. Though not all the Plumfield students make a second appearance, Alcott's famous favorites remain.<br />A decade later, Demi is having trouble deciding on a career and declaring himself to a certain young lady. Tommy is in pursuit of his childhood sweetheart, Nan, who has vowed to be a spinster for life. Nat is sent to Germany, far away from his beloved Daisy, for musical training. Emil is shipwrecked, Dan tangles with the law, and young Ted gets into scrapes worthy of his namesake's youth. There is enough \\"lovering\\" and \\"spooning\\" here to make up for the lack in \\"Little Men\\", but some characters brought in for the romance are ex machina.<br />\\"Jo's Boys\\" is also agonizingly preachy. I don't just mean the campaigning for women's suffrage and against alcohol, but also all the sermonizing about mastering one's faults, appreciating others' virtues, testing the strength of love by waiting, etc. Mrs. March's three surviving daughters try their best, but they cannot equal her talent for lecturing without putting people to sleep. The story positively drags when the moralizing begins.<br />At least no one has to forsake his or hercastle in the air, this time around. Even though Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie had to give up their artistic aspirations, being deficient in \\"genius,\\" the next generation of dreamers does not suffer the same fate. Few of them are made to \\"grow out of\\" whatever made them so wonderful during childhood. This almost makes up for the novel's appalling lack of polish.<br />Read \\"Jo's Boys\\" for closure, but if you feel homesick for Plumfield, stick to \\"Little Men\\".	2002-05-08

It's enough to make anyone's mind a little turvy-topsy, if you take my meaning.<br />Here is an example of what to expect: At the beginning of the novel, Cecilia draws an angel on her windowpane with one of her tears--a tear angel. It makes her wonder if tear angels are the same as angel tears. Like I said, everything is turned downsideup . . . but it all still manages to make sense.<br />The two main characters are a human girl named Cecilia and an angel from Heaven named Ariel. Cecilia is so ill that she cannot leave her bed, so Ariel comes to visit her on an angel watch. As he tells her things about Heaven, she tells him things about Earth; so this is really a conversation between an aspect of Heaven and an aspect of Earth. It so happens, Ariel tells Cecilia, that only angels and humans are able to wonder at themselves--to wonder at being able to wonder.<br />The conflict in this story comes more from their dialogue than from the plot. If you like philosophy, then you'll love the way they toss ideas back and forth like a game of pong-ping. &quot;Through a Glass, Darkly&quot; is more mystical than &quot;Sophie's World&quot;, however, and more poetic. In &quot;Sophie's World&quot; Jostein Gaarder toyed with everyone's world of knowledge, asking us how we can be sure we know what we think we know. In this novelette, he plays with the heady concept that we are all eyes of God, scattered throughout Creation: the mirrors the Creator uses to see Himself and all His works. A philosopher/astrologer named Alan Watts described this same concept as &quot;God, playing hide-and-seek with Himself.&quot; (Or isn't it seek-and-hide?)<br />This book is a lot like &quot;Mr. God, This Is Anna&quot; by Fynn. Part irreverent theology, part reverent heresy, &quot;Through a Glass, Darkly&quot; is so far-outthat it speaks directly to what is close-in. Read it with an open mind and a young heart.	2002-04-26

Illustrations) (English and Italian Edition)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A Great Allegory for Children!	Since another reviewer has already stated why this edition/transation is the best one to buy, my review will focus on the story, which is a charming allegory for children, no matter what language is used to tell it.<br />Children identify with Pinocchio because of all his troubles. They understand what it is like to want to and mean to do well, only to fail miserably. They are also very capable of matching his extremes of emotion. Childhood is so full of humiliations that they don't think, \\"Oh, what an idiot not to have gotten it by now\\" or \\"He's overreacting terribly.\\" (In fact, these are things said about _them_.) Instead, they cheer Pinocchio, who commits blunder after blunder--and is rewarded at the end of the book, for finally getting it right.<br />Also endearing are the puppet's \\"parents,\\" old woodcarver Geppetto and the \\"fairy with blue hair.\\" Despite their scapegrace's repeated failures, they forgive him again and again, giving him countless chances to redeem himself. As for the villains who prey on Pinocchio's naivete, they are perfect representations of what children find threatening. Some characters resemble playground bullies; others are more like the monsters under the bed. The talking animals are a little exasperating, but very nice.<br />\\"The Adventures of Pinocchio\\" is as whimsy as Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\": in both novels, anything goes. Unlike Carroll, however, Collodi injected moral lessons into the storyline. Pinocchio does not get into one humiliating episode after another just to amuse young readers; with every mistake he makes, he learns a moral lesson. <br />The plot structure is \\"poor\\"--which works to the book's advantage. This is what-happens-next kind of reading. Children care foremost about what new agonies a protagonist can propel himself into, and so will like the pace.<br />Accept no abridgements or adaptations. There are wonderful details that are often cut out for economy--or rewritten for somebody's idea ofstyle. For the real Pinocchio, read this book.	2002-04-07

A friendly warning to readers: Even though \\"The Way to Write for Children\\" is very precise about what SHOULD NOT be in children's books, it is quite the opposite about what SHOULD be in them.<br />On the very first page of the text, Joan Aiken bluntly informs readers that \\"there is no _one_ way in which to write for children.\\" In another chapter, she explains the futility of dividing child readers into age groups and trying to target a single age. Throughout the book, she gives examples of what she considers poor children's literature--and not without good reason.<br />Aiken is not a writing teacher who says, \\"Do this and this and this, but not that.\\" She is more like a mentor whose gut instinct about these matters is so finely developed that she can tell what will work and what will not, even though she may not be able to explain why. Yet she does try! Those who like their writing manuals well organized into clean-cut sections and subsections will not appreciate her attempts, but those who understand that she is truly sincere may dig deeper and find unexpected treasure.<br />You'll enjoy this book more if you have read as much children's literature as Aiken has and are familiar with the authors and titles that she liberally \\"name drops\\" throughout the text. I bought my copy three years ago and understood about 10% of it. Then I started studying some of the books she used as examples: \\"Daddy-Long-Legs\\", \\"Poems of Childhood\\", \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"I Am the Cheese\\", etc. With that, her words took on new life for me.<br />I can compare reading \\"The Way to Write for Children\\" to listening to a wise and remarkable friend speak--but not lecture--about children's literature. It is definitely not writing school, but the education I receive is superior.	2002-03-21

Some are for grown ups who love children. Some are for children who have no idea how dear they are to the grown ups in their lives.<br />Despite having had my copy of Poems of Childhood for ten years, I know absolutely nothing about Eugene Field save what I can infer from the poems in this collection. From their recurring themes, and the order in which they appear, I can guess that Field lost a child who was very precious to him . . . was slowly healed of his grief by the love and presence of other children . . . and was given a second chance with the birth of a new baby. <br />There are about 15 poems that hint of that lost child and a handful that juxtapose sleep and death, making me wonder if the baby died in its sleep. Other sad poems are merely wistful about beloved children who have grown up. Thankfully, there are just as many happy poems as sad ones: cheery verses about toys, imaginary creatures, and playground games. Field also wrote several lullabies that are perfect for rocking children to sleep, whether or not they are put to music. <br />I dont know any other poet who has brought such dignity to \\"babytalk.\\" Toddlers in his poems are called names like Pittypat, Tippytoe, Googly-Goo and Luddy-Dud. His imaginary fairies include Amberglee, Daisybright and Pilfercurds. Moreover, Im sure that no other collection of childrens poems has this many terms for \\"dreamland\\"--Blinkiwink garden, Shut-Eye town, and Hushaby street, to name a few.<br />Though Field could be accused of writing the same poems over and over again, most of his verses have such distinctive _personalities_ that this is not entirely true. What they _all_ have in common is his delicate touch--yes, even the ones in which his voice turns rustic and homey--that has endeared him to children and grown ups alike.	2002-03-19

This novel could be described as \\"Beverly Cleary plus Zilpha Keatley Snyder, with a touch of Carolyn Keene.\\" In other words, it has friendship elements, almost-magical elements, and some mystery elements, all at the same time.<br />This story is told in first person by Elizabeth, the new girl in town. With the perspicacity of a Ramona Quimby or a Harriet M. Welsch, she makes wonderfully droll observations about people she meets and things she does. (This makes it a little hard to believe that she's just ten years old--but the narration is so nice that this flaw is easily overlooked.) Her cleverness and wry humor fail her, however, when it comes to Jennifer, the first real friend she makes, who is unlike anyone she has ever met before.<br />On their first meeting, Jennifer cooly reveals that she is a witch and performs a number of seemingly magical feats to prove it. Before long, she starts to train Elizabeth to be a witch, too. Yet despite all the \\"bonding\\" they do, as Jennifer prepares rituals, rules, spells and surprises for her willing friend, their relationship remains slightly stiff. I am certain that readers won't mind, at first: Jennifer is too fascinating and her ideas are too imaginative and funny for anyone to complain about any lack of warmth. Besides, anyone is better than Cynthia, who lives one floor up from Elizabeth and is exactly what Angelica Pickles of \\"Rugrats\\" will be like in a few years.<br />Come the end, readers will have read a rollickingly good yarn sprinkled with practical lessons about friendship--so there really is nothing to mind about this novel. I recommend it for young girls who have liked \\"Harriet the Spy\\" by Louise Fitzhugh.	2002-03-15

In such a potent setting, Polly does not just relive the days of her friendship with Max, but also the glory days of Ancient Greece. <br />Max is a fascinating character, a painter who reads classical literature and has anthropology for a hobby. Keeping with the Greek theme, she becomes a Mentor to Polly, gently drawing the girl out of her shell. Anyone who has ever felt like an outcast will believe in the wonder of a friendship with someone who FINALLY, thank God in Heaven, UNDERSTANDS. Yet Max is not that simple. As she opens Polly's eyes to the complexities of life and of people, she reveals her own--and Polly must come to terms with that dark side. When she does so, she also comes to terms with her own.<br />The sexual elements in this story are unavoidable. When we open ourselves to everything sacred, spiritual, human, and real, we also open ourselves to what is sexual. Then we are not always touched by the light alone, but also by the darkness. In this novel about the coming of age of a young woman, L'Engle does not insult readers by tiptoeing around the truth: she presents life with powerful complexity, no matter which character she holds up to scrutiny. Yet she isundoubtedly on the side of the light: the novel's climax is a \\"vision of love\\" worthy of all Christian mystics.<br />\\"A House Like a Lotus\\" is probably the best novel she has ever written.	2002-03-12

For one thing, it is not set in Narnia at all and relates mostly Archenland history. For another, the heroes of the story are natives of that magical world, not children from our own. Finally, it has a strange effect on readers, who end up either loving it or hating it.<br />In the very first chapter, Shasta, a boy who is obviously one of the story's heroes, finds out that the man he has always called father merely found him in a basket by the seashore. There's nothing like mystery to open an adventure story--and the plot thickens when Shasta meets an enslaved talking horse named Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah (called Bree, for short). Bree and Shasta make a deal: if Shasta helps Bree to escape, then Bree will take him to Narnia, where they will both be free.<br />Of course, C.S. Lewis managed to throw a few obstacles in their way, some of them involving lions, to make the plot more interesting. As this story is set during the reign of Peter the High King, he even included some fascinating political intrigue, courtly chivalry, _and_ a lovely bloody battle. I particularly liked his descriptions of Calormen and its people, which really brought out their culture (though Archenland was allowed to remain a reasonable facsimile of Narnia). <br />However, these vivid and opulent descriptions are one reason why \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" rubs some readers the wrong way. Young people love to return to Narnia again and again because they each have their own Narnia: ultimately, Narnia springs from the imaginations of all readers, not Lewis' alone. The details about Calormen may stir those who have practiced visualizing with \\"A Thousand and One Nights\\", but they will do nothing for children raised on a diet of Western fairytales.<br />Moreover, a great deal of the writing is satirical and satire is humor for adults. Those who know a bit about Arab culture will appreciate the characterization of the Calormenes (or else be terribly offended by it), but only the more sophisticated readers will know exactly what Lewis is poking fun at when he creates proverbs such as, \\"As a costly jewel retains its value even when hidden in a dunghill, so old age and discretion are to be respected even in the vile persons of our subjects.\\" <br />Yet I can assure all readers and Narnia lovers that, despite the contrary elements of this novel, Aslan will not disappoint.	2002-03-09

Not so with &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the second book in the series (or &quot;Jo's Boys&quot;, the last book, for that matter).<br />For a long time, there was something about &quot;Good Wives&quot; that I did not like, but could not name. Now that I am in college, learning from and loving this novel for the first time, I know exactly what was once so off-putting to me: &quot;Good Wives&quot; is about changing and growing up--things that were completely alien to me in elementary school.<br />In this book, Meg struggles to be a poor man's wife and a good mother--tasks more trying than being a dutiful daughter and a kind older sister. Jo learns to hold her &quot;abominable tongue&quot; (a slight disappointment, admittedly) and aspires to be more like Beth. Amy comes to terms with money, her limitations, and what she really wants from life. Laurie drops his rascal's streak and resolves to become more serious. In the saddest twist of the story, Beth dies.<br />The things that happen to the March girls (and the Laurence boy) are no longer the happy sketches of youthful scrapes, pranks and plays. By the second chapter, &quot;The First Wedding&quot;, the first of them sets foot in the world of grown-ups, where actions have long-term consequences and one must make life-defining choices on one's own. The events in these books are sobering life experiences.<br />Much of &quot;Good Wives&quot; is made up of lengthy narrations--many passages quite preachy--that mostly illustrate what life-changing epiphanies the characters are having. Side by side with descriptions of the setting, background and new characters, are descriptions of life's crossroads. The characters also no longer bump into each other as much as before (except in certain delightful chapters); afer all, they _are_ learning to leave the nest and flyto where life is calling. &quot;Good Wives&quot; is also a novel filled with goodbyes.<br />Despite my initial dislike of this book and its more serious, sober air (though the chapter &quot;Daisy and Demi&quot; does give a hint of the frolicsome things to come in &quot;Little Men&quot;), I give it Five Stars because of the way it probed deeper: it explored not only the intricacies of family ties, friendships, and first loves, but also the characters relationships to the world, to society, and to themselves. Ultimately, though the innocent joys of childhood become completely lost to Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, and Laurie, the five earn a new happiness--something closer to glory.	2002-03-05
US	47316940	R3O2TKMBJBI74U	0312975856	56919881	The Phantom of Manhattan	Books	5	6	16	N	N	Intense!	I think that Frederick Forsythe's sequel to Gaston Leroux's &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; is actually better than the original, though being a purist about many writers and books, I can understand why fans of Leroux gave this novel negative reviews.<br />The first reason I think &quot;The Phantom of Manhattan&quot; deserves Five Stars is that it is better written. Leroux crammed a lot of detail and intrigue into the first &quot;Phantom&quot;--so much so that his attempt at an accurate historical account came off as a ghost story blown up into a pachyderm of a legend, when it was perfectly all right as a ghost story. Moreover, as a legend, it made a mess of a novel. Forsythe's &quot;Phantom&quot; is smoother in style, not to mention more fast paced and gripping. I was kept in suspense until the very last pages. <br />Even his setting is more believable than Laroux's--or perhaps I just haven't read enough novels set in nineteenth century France to know better. What I can say is that Forsythe adds details--real details from historical New York that add credibility to those from his imagination. They also bring out his sense of humor, like when a society writer skeptically wishes luck to a Russian immigrant who is working to become an established composer. This immigrant just happened to be Irving Berlin in a literary &quot;cameo.&quot;<br />The story is told in first person, as are many chapters of Laroux's &quot;Phantom&quot;. Only this time, the style is less confusing and bumpy, despite the addition of more narrators. A character from the first novel, Antoinette Giry, opens the story brilliantly, with a revealing deathbed confession about her _real_ relationship to Erik. It won't be the last shock provided by her character. Yet hard-core fans will note that Forsythe took liberties in changing Mme. Giry's character from an opera maid to a mistress of the corps de ballet, as well as in adding characters who may seem, at first glance, not--ahem!--worthy of beingprominent in the same novel as Erik, Christine and Raoul. <br />These objections only distract from the whole point: &quot;The Phantom of Manhattan&quot; is amazing! Each chapter either sheds light on what Leroux chose to leave in shadow (such as what transpired between Christine and Erik while Raoul and the Persian were trapped in the torture chamber), or sprinkles gunpowder for unexpected explosions meant to come later (like Darius' conversation with his &quot;god of gold&quot;). The entire plot is like a timebomb ticking away to the climax, which, despite the sort of tragedy Phantom Phans expect, is somehow quite fitting.	2002-02-26

(Readers find out exactly what that is by at least the third page and never forget it.) Nevertheless, he does bring the heroine closer to her dreams by sending to her to college for free. He's also mysterious and eccentric--a nice touch.<br />This heroine is Jerusha Abbot, who pluckily changes her name to Judy as soon as she enters college. Most of the novel is composed of her letters to the kind trustee, whom she has named Daddy-Long-Legs. Her observations on her roommates, friends, classes, teachers, and life in general are a delight to read and her style is light and funny. She remains as likeable today as she was when this book was first published in 1912.<br />Thankfully, the \\"modern\\" details that Webster sprinkled throughout the text will not get in the way of readers' enjoyment. When Judy confesses that she hadn't known that R.L.S. stood for Robert Louis Stevenson or that George Eliot was a lady--and almost laments that she \\"wasn't brought up on 'Little Women'\\"--readers don't mind that neither had they. It is the spirit of the words that comes through to them: they understand what is important--her embarrassment at the fact and her motivation to correct it--and that is enough.<br />As Webster considered herself a socialist and a reformer, one of the reasons she wrote \\"Daddy-Long-Legs\\" was definitely to show the more uppity folk of the early twentieth century that even children who are brought up in orphan asylums _can_ become useful, productive adults when they grow up.<br />Of course, the appeal of this children's novel has less to do with that message than with Judy's (and therefore, Webster's) sense of humor. I'm sure that children breeze through--and soon forget--Judy's little sermons about the need to cultivate imagination in children or the virtue of doing things out of love and not duty. (The passages about socialism are another story, however. Judy's socialist streak is one of the most fun--and one of the most important--elements in \\"Daddy-Long-Legs\\".)<br />On the other hand, children will love the more whimsical details. For example, during one lonely Christmas, Judy bought herself some presents; pretended that they came from her family in California; and proceeded to make up, name and characterize each hypothetical family member. Yes, this novel is great fun.	2002-02-23

She sees each story she shares as a cure for a spiritual deprivation, and so retells each one in her rich, soulful style, adding Latino ethnic twists to increase the illumination. Then, sounding like a village wise woman, she explains the effects of each type of deprivation in the souls and bodies of women. For instance, she interprets \\"The Little Match Girl\\" as a story about the necessity of putting one's creativity (represented by the matches) to good use: the failure to do so makes one freeze to death.<br />Certainly, women need the sort of healing that stories can give them--but so does everyone in the world, male or female. Men just didn't happen to be part of Estes' \\"target audience\\" when she wrote \\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\", I suppose. Yet it is precisely this book that encouraged me to read \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" and \\"The Selfish Giant\\" to my little brothers.<br />The wondrous thing about this book is that it is only one person's opinion about the power of certain myths. Anyone is free to agree or disagree with Estes . . . to take or reject her advice . . . to give her chosen stories different meanings . . . to apply her meanings to different stories. For example, Estes used \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" to lament how a rigid, uncompromising society can oppress mothers into abandoning \\"unconventional\\" children. To that I add that if the ducklings had had a father duck around, then the ugly duckling would have had proper protection from the pond bullies and a lot more backbone.<br />It is also delightful to recognize the archetypes playing hide-and-seek in the fairytales and myths of many cultures. Russia's \\"Vasalisa\\" is uncannily like \\"Snow White\\", except that the cottage in the woods houses a witch (Baba Yaga), rather than seven dwarves. Also, the colors white, red and ebony/black are not found in the features of the story's heroine, but are sewn into the dress of her doll. Then there are the striking similarities between \\"Bluebeard\\" and the Greek myth of Eros and Psyche. (Of course, the difference is that one ends happily and the other does not.)<br />Finally, I love the way almost every sentence here rings with the kind of beauty and passion I have come to expect only in poetry, never in prose. For this reason, I can sit with this book and just dip into the paragraphs to be refreshed.<br />The most potentially disturbing element in \\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\" is Estes' firm faith in the Life/Death/Life cycle--something very pagan. If readers miss the point early in the book, all the references to long-gone goddess-based religions of the ancient world will certainly drive home the fact. Personally, I thought it less bothersome than all the psychological concepts she used--half of which I don't buy at all. I've found that it helps to remind oneself all throughout the story that even though Estes writes of something true and deep, it doesn't follow that all women must identify with wolves (I happen to relate to mice), or feel like wild women, in order to be healthy in spirit.	2002-02-20

It is an exciting adventure story in its own right, though it does begin deceptively, dragging its feet. <br />Digory Kirke is the nephew; Andrew Ketterley is the magician; and Polly Plummer is the girl who lives a few doors down. The two children have been warned to keep away from eccentric Uncle Andrew, which they do gladly. One day, however, they accidentally enter his private study and get tangled in his mad experiment involving magical worlds. <br />Here the adventure begins in earnest. Digory and Polly visit a \\"deplorable world\\" called Charn and awaken the Queen Jadis. When they try to return to Earth, Jadis follows them, intending to conquer and rule their world, as she had conquered and ruled Charn. In their desperate attempts to take Jadis back to her own world, the children accidentally bring her--_and_ Uncle Andrew--into Narnia, on the day of its birth.<br />What follows is the longest bit of Narnian history since the story of the Telmarines in \\"Prince Caspian\\" (unless you count \\"The Horse and His Boy\\", which _also_ preceded \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" in the original ordering). There is the creation of Narnia, the selection of the talking beasts, the story of Latern Waste, the coronation of the first king and queen, and the entry of evil . . .<br />It is THIS history which makes \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" so wonderful. The history breathes new life into the Narnia that readers (ought to) already know and love. Learning about the creation of this magical world and about the past of the already-intriguing Professor Kirke of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is most fun when one has already been to Narnia and met Professor Kirke, so to speak.<br />There are other great things about this book, of course, such as the description of Charn (especially the room of figures), the conversation of the animals, the subplot involving Digory's mother, and many other elements. Discover them for yourself and experience the magic.<br />What I like most about \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", however, is how a paradox of good and evil is twisted into the plot. We all know that Digory and Polly weren't supposed to have awoken Jadis, much less brought her anywhere near Narnia. Yet it is precisely because they did it that Narnia became so special. The paradox is that it took a sin--or rather, the forgiveness of a repented sin--to truly bless Narnia.	2002-02-05

Will she be the one to fill the emptiness in their hearts and the silence in their home, at last?<br />Some adjustments _will_ have to be made first.

The children have to get used to a new and unorthodox mother. Yet their hope that everything will work out always shines through.<br />\\"Sarah, Plain and Tall\\" is a story about people learning to live together and become a family simply because they've grown to love each other. It is also about seeing both new things with old eyes and old things with new eyes. The reader will enjoy this short, joy-filled period in the lives of these characters, whether they are learning how to swim, sliding down haystacks, or tossing cut hair to birds.<br />Patricia MacLachlan uses very simple language, which only highlights her poet's gift of saying volumes and painting landscapes with a few well-chosen words. The images in the novel are as potent as images in poetry, even though everything is in prose. Every last word is meaningful.<br />I need only think of \\"Sarah, Plain and Tall\\" to remember that sometimes the simplest children's stories are the best.	2002-01-29

What child could resist the almost fairytale-like rags-to-riches, riches-to-rags twists in this novel? It has all the elements needed to be a \\"growing up book\\" read over and over by children and remembered fondly by adults.<br />At the beginning, Sara Crewe is a little girl so rich that she has her own French maid, a pony, and a rug that was once a live tiger (yes, the head is still on), all while attending boarding school. This school is run by Miss Minchin, one of the nastiest, yet still realistic, adult characters in children's fiction. While Sara is still rich, Miss Minchin is nothing but nice to her. After Sara loses her money, however, Miss Minchin shows her true colors and makes Sara work as a scullery maid in the school. To come through unhardened, Sara turns to faithful friends, to hope, and to her imagination.<br />Another reason that this novel is so well loved is simply Sara's character. Pardon this sweeping generalization, but I think that there isn't a girl alive who doesn't wish to be like Sara, if only a teeny, tiny bit. Sara is beautiful, intelligent, and so imaginative that she can make an entire schoolroom listen breathlessly to one of her yarns. She doesn't climb trees or skip stones . . . but no character is perfect.<br />A word of warning: Don't expect boarding school sketches worthy of \\"What Katy Did at School\\" by Susan Coolidge, \\"Little Men\\" by Louisa May Alcott, or even \\"And Both Were Young\\" by Madeleine L'Engle. Practically the entire story takes place in Sara's mind and she seems to block out the less rosy aspects of her environment. (Despite what anyone says, I'll warrant that she's a bit self-centered, too.) In the same way, Burnett refuses to let anything into this fictional world that hasn't been romanticized or idealized first. One thing this book has taught me is that there is actually such a thing as \\"too much imagination.\\" If children become too dreamy-eyed after reading this book, get them into sports immediately.<br />Yet not even I can disparage the loving attention to detail by a writer who, very much like her protagonist, delighted in imagining the most romantic things and revealing them to an enraptured audience. Naturally, my favorite descriptions are those of Sara's pretty things. Even as a child, I could envision everything that Frances Hogdson Burnett described: streetlights shining through heavy London fog, a doll with a miniature opera glass, child-sized hats with ostrich plumes, golden sunsets seen from attic windows, furniture come all the way from India . . . <br />\\"A Little Princess\\" truly is a gateway to a whole other world. A few dips into it now and then ought to be fine.	2002-01-19

The nine magically airy yarns in this small collection are definitely in the first category.<BR> <BR>&quot;The Happy Prince&quot; and &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; are perhaps the most famous of the nine. In the first story, the golden statue of a prince weeps for all the suffering people he sees and begs a swallow to strip him of his riches and distribute them to the masses. In the second tale, a giant builds a wall around his beautiful garden to keep out the noisy children, only to find out that he has also locked out the Spring. <br />&quot;The Young King&quot; is a variation on the theme of &quot;A Happy Prince&quot;. When a young monarch learns of the suffering and misery caused by his requirement for a robe, a crown, and a sceptre, he refuses to handle any of these riches and is given a more fitting raiment by a Divine Power. Keeping with the royal theme is &quot;The Star-Child&quot;, about a beautiful but horrible young boy whose physical appearance grows to match his ugly spirit. Another little bird appears in &quot;The Nightingale and the Rose&quot;, to help a young man win the heart of the woman he loves. <br />The stories' themes include beauty, tragedy, agony, compassion, innocence, and (Platonic) love. Some characters give their lives, or sell their souls, in the name of love. There are also the same archetypes that appear in dreams: the Divine Child, the Trickster, the Wise Old Man or Woman, the Number 3, and more. Add all this to Wilde's delicate writing and gilded imagination, and you get some of the most original tales ever written. <br />Though most of these stories end happily, all end tragically. That is to say, even when the endings are happy, someone always dies. Each story manages to associate everything thrilling and exquisite about beauty with the starkness of death. Accordingly, not all of these tales are suitable for children. For example, one scene in &quot;The Fisherman and His Soul&quot; features witches dancing before the devil and the princess in &quot;The Birthday of the Infanta&quot; is a heartless child whose mockery leads to the death of a little dwarf. Though the stories are moral at the core, and often explicitly Christian, they do not always make sense. <br />Despite the faults, the keening, poignant loveliness shines through, making me want to read each story again and again and again.	2002-01-12

(After all, today's culture has replaced the romantic nursery with the plastic daycare.) In those days, standard fare for children were characters who earned &quot;sweetmeats&quot; for memorizing a psalm or some other school lesson, who never got dirty without being punished, who were generally good (albeit boring) role models for young people who were to be seen, but not heard.<br />Then, one &quot;golden afternoon,&quot; an eccentric, avuncular, dear man told a group of children a story about a girl who tumbled down a rabbit hole and found herself in a world called Wonderland. I can picture the delight on the listeners' faces at each strange new twist--be it a talking animal that is as mad as they come . . . or an admittedly hilarious pun. <br />Take the Mock Turtle, who tells Alice of a school master he and his classmates called Tortoise. Since this teacher was a turtle, why was he called &quot;Tortoise,&quot; Alice wanted to know. The Mock Turtle replied, &quot;We called him Tortoise because he taught us.&quot;<br />Admittedly, the title character is still very Victorian. (I would say, hopelessly wishywashy.) That she exhibits only healthy curiosity, not outright astonishment, at the fact that a world like Wonderland can exist is a hint of what kind of children will enjoy this book. These ideal readers are those who see no difference between the mad world around them and the mad world down a rabbit hole. (Once they start to see, and to expect, rhyme and reason in what they read, it is time for J.M. Barrie's &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.)<br />As for you adults, don't worry about the plot, because there are several, all of them wiggly, that keep the story going. Don't look for much substance either. Unlike other fantasy worlds, Wonderland is a place where anything goes and so everything does go. Go mad, that is.<br/>Despite this _and_ the fact that children are no longer confined by Victorian standards, &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot; remains popular and in print. This may have something to do with Carroll's &quot;golden afternoon&quot; of storytelling (honored with its inclusion in the lyrics of a Disney song). I personally consider it an apt symbolism of the truth that the _place_ called Wonderland just happens to be hidden somewhere in the _time_ called childhood. How fortunate are those who have known that golden afternoon and all its wonders, and who remember how to return!	2001-12-25

In the first of the &quot;Kairos&quot; books, &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;, Madeleine L'Engle took Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and Calvin O'Keefe on a quest through the macrocosm of time and space. In this second book, &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot;, she adds an even deeper dimension to her fictional world--which she makes as real to us as our world, sometimes even more real--by sending them on a journey into the microcosm of the human body.<br />How is it possible for a human being to enter a human body, you may ask, as did the still-irritable, yet still-lovable, Meg Murry. In a special class that teaches universal truths, rather than the imports and exports of Nicaragua, Meg, Calvin, Mr. Jenkins, and the also-human readers will meet a cherubim who has memorized the names of the stars . . . speak to a farandola inside one of Charles Wallace's cells . . . watch the birth of a star &quot;small&quot; enough to hold in a human hand . . . and ultimately learn that size, number, order, and anything that can be measured does not matter.<br />What do matter are names, for &quot;He knows them all by name&quot; . . . even the little stars so far away from inhabited planets that only those who see without eyes know their names. The loss of a star is no more and no less tragic to the Universe than the death of a young boy. Everything we does matters. Everything we touch sends ripples into the cosmos--the cosmos within and the cosmos without. This time, the mission is to save Charles Wallace's life. Annihilators called the Echthroi want to X him, as they want to X everything else in the Universe. As the book's characters were bound to fight them in the story, we are bound to fight them in real life. This is adventure on a grand scale!<br />Though the literary critic in me sees a lot of less-than-perfect elements in this novel, I still gave &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot; five stars because what matters most about it is its message. L'Engle's plot twists and fictional inventions make even me raise my eyebrows a few times, but her passion never fails to captivate me. Without fail, it draws me into a world too real to be imaginary and gives me faith in my own world.	2001-12-06

How many will _not_ find corny a tableau of two school-aged hedgehogs frying ham for a mole and a water rat, in a badger's kitchen?<br />Moreover, Kenneth Grahame's narration reminded me of the kind of things an elderly English gentleman would say while showing his well-behaved grandchildren in Eton collars and boaters around the family's countryside estate. To some readers, this will be hopelessly boring; to others, it will be wonderful and charming. The former group will find it hard to understand the glory of being up at dawn and floating quietly down a river, past loosestrife, willowherb, bulrushes and meadowsweet, having never experienced it. The latter group ought to have more experience in letting dreams fill in what memory cannot. To be fair, though, picnics, boat rides and such really are exciting to only a tiny segment of readers.<br />Substantial conflict appears in this episodic novel only when the exasperating Mr. Toad does; and Mr. Toad's &quot;frivolous antics&quot; take up only half of the book. I found myself wishing that it had taken Badger, Mole, Rat and Toad much longer to reclaim Toad Hall from the weasels and stoats who had &quot;invaded&quot; it. In my almost-grown-up opinion, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; ends too soon and too suddenly after it starts to get interesting.	2001-12-04

He has to build a special pen, buy food with his own allowance, and even do some odd jobs for extra money. Also, as Shiloh is really someone else's dog, Marty has to lie and keep secrets from his parents and friends. He excuses his actions with the fact that Shiloh is better off with him than with the abusive original owner--which is, I know, justification enough for most readers. The novel is not that simplistic, though: Marty eventually realizes that he will have to come clean, even if it will mean losing his dog.<br />The characters in &quot;Shiloh&quot; are well-drawn and realistic. It was nice to read about complex people who love animals, grow up with guns and occasionally hunt for their own food. Their West Virginian dialect is a pleasure to read. Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's observations, through Marty's eyes, really seem like an eleven-year-old boy's, not a grown woman writer's. Moreover, her pace, like her integrity as a storyteller, never lags.<br />This is a great book for teaching children not just about dogs and other pets, but about right and wrong. Nothing is purely white or purely black in this novel, not even the &quot;villian,&quot; Judd Travers. There is a powerful scene near the climax when Marty starts asking himself questions about what is ethical and what is not--about whether or not the ends justify the means. All the scenes that follow show how a young boy, through his love for his dog, learns life lessons about maturity, responsibility and respect.<br />Despite all this complexity, the lessons of &quot;Shiloh&quot;, like its theme, are very simple. They are the universal values that all children pick up for themselves whenever they truly experience life.	2001-11-03
US	47316940	R29B6GYNTXTZH1	0064471071	671298565	The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (The Chronicles of Narnia, Book 5)	Books	5	11	14	N	N	An &quot;Odyssey&quot; for Children	After reading the very first line, &quot;There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it,&quot; I realized that I had made a huge mistake beginning &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; half an hour before bedtime. More exciting and adventure-packed than the two preceeding books (in the original ordering, of course), &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, it is hard to put down.<br />The main characters that readers will recognize are King Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, and Reepicheep. Sadly, Peter and Susan have since become too old to reenter Narnia; but the story does amazingly well even without them. Here, Eustace, who will reappear in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, is introduced for the first time. They are an interesting bunch, all providing something essential to the story, especially Reepicheep (whose character and personal history are developed further) and Eustace (who experiences a wonderful kind of redemption).<br />The Dawn Treader is a ship King Caspian built in order to fulfil an oath made on his coronation day to find the seven lords and friends of his father that his uncle Miraz had sent to explore the Eastern Seas. Every two chapters or so, the Dawn Treader stops at an island, where its crew and passengers have a small adventure-within-the-larger-adventure, discover the fate of each of the seven lords, and learn good moral lessons. For instance, one island, called the Dark Island, is a place where dreams come true. It may sound wonderful, until you realize that the dreams that come true are not the pleasant daydreams, but the nightmares. After the last island, the passengers even reach, or very nearly reach, the End of the World. <br />Though I compared this book to Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot; in the title of this review, I must add that it can also be likened to John Bunyan's &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot;. This voyage is not guided by fate and devoid of reason, but is blessed byAslan (who symbolizes Jesus) and is full of meaning and purpose. It does not merely represent the passage through life, but the passage through life _as a Christian_. That may be why one reviewer complained that this novel is overly preachy. Yet we readers are human, after all, and in need of being preached to now and then. Another thing that may surprise readers is the chivalry with which Lucy, the only girl on the ship, is treated by the men. Though it not &quot;politically correct,&quot; as Eustace himself points out at the beginning, it has a certain rightness to it. <br />Remembering how the March girls in Louisa May Alcott's &quot;Little Women&quot; played at being good in imitation of the character Christian in &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot;, only to realize that their game was really a way of life, I can say that it would be wonderful if children today could apply the allegories in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; in the same way. Parents, take note: it is easier to ask a child, &quot;What would Edmund tell you about forgiving someone who has done wrong, like Eustace?&quot; than to launch into a weary sermon about forgiveness that they may not remember anyway. There are more archetypes in this book, and in all stories about Narnia, than C.S. Lewis himself must have realized: and children can only benefit from knowing them as they grow up.	2001-10-26

It is somewhat disconcerting, therefore, when the story opens with a rather clumsy squeak. The four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, find themselves unceremoniously _yanked_ back to Narnia after one Earth year and many Narnian centuries of being away. There is no party to welcome them, only apples growing wild to feed them, and only the ruins of a castle to shelter them.<br />As the children have been gone for so long, some backtracking is necessary before their heroic adventures can begin. As he did in all the books in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, C.S. Lewis gives us a bit of Narnian history that puts the present events in perspective and is genuinely fun to read. This History lesson begins with the Telmarine invasion after the Golden Age of Narnia and ends with the battle between Prince Caspian and his evil uncle Miraz. It's a lesson so absorbing and believable that it makes Narnia seem more real than, say, Bavaria. The political intrigue sprinkled throughout the book is a fine bonus.<br />What I liked most about &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; was the chance to see the two Kings and two Queens of Cair Paravel in action. Their adventures and their characters were given very little space or elaboration at the end of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;; so I was glad to be able to really see them as their royal Narnian selves. (Now that I've read further, I can say that &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; is even better for this purpose. After reading &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, I discovered why King Peter was dubbed Magnificent; and after reading &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, I learned why Queen Susan was called Gentle; King Edmund, Just; and Queen Lucy, Valiant.)<br />And what would Narnia be without Aslan? (I LOVE THIS LION!) In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, the major lesson that he imparts is that we must have faith and follow him, even when we may appear foolish to others. If we keep insisting that we can find the way by ourselves, then we only get lost. There are other morals throughout the book, most of them woven into the story, such as King Peter's courage in challenging Miraz to a &quot;clean wager of battle&quot; (read: one-on-one combat), &quot;to prevent the effusion of blood&quot; (read: the blood of his innocent subjects). Lewis can moralize better than any other children's writer I know.<br />&quot;Prince Caspian&quot; is not to blame for being the second book in the series--therefore, the sequel that can't help but be slightly disappointing. Though I gave it four stars for the bumpy linkages in the plot, child readers will, if asked, say it deserves five.hat would Narnia be without Aslan? (I LOVE THIS LION!)

US	47316940	RKQQZOKCLX093	0140432108	866295104	Agnes Grey (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	81	89	N	N	Simple, Unpretentious and Down-to-Earth	After reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (by Emily), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (by Charlotte), and &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (by Anne), I found myself slightly disappointed by the lack of passion and romanticism in Anne Bronte's &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;. This novel truly is simple, unpretentious, and down-to-earth--and, therefore, far too easy to underestimate and undervalue.<br />The title character is the younger daughter of a poor family, who seeks employment as a governess in order to help her parents make ends meet. This noble act of maturity on her part earns her nothing but disillusion, humiliation and hardship in the hands of the tyrannical children and over-indulgent parents of Wellwood House (Note the intriguing initials W.H., which stand for Wuthering Heights and Wildfell Hall in other Bronte books) and, later, Horton Lodge. For several chapters, Anne Bronte does not do much but--dare I say it?--complain about the lot of the Victorian governess. Though her portraits of the children and their parents were obviously drawn from reality, which certainly won sympathy from me, I wanted to tell her to &quot;Get on with the story&quot; many times.<br />The plot does pick up after the artful and exasperating Rosalie Murray has her &quot;coming out&quot; ball. Thoughtless rather than tyrannical, Rosalie has the most well-drawn character of all of Agnes' charges, which makes her such a great foil for Agnes. Rosalie delights in thinking that she could have any man she wishes and enjoys nothing more than toying with men's hearts. When she finds out that Agnes might be in love with the curate, Edward Weston, she makes every attempt to make Mr. Weston fall in love with _her_, thinking that it would be a grand joke to make Agnes miserable. Yet it is impossible to hate her, somehow. She steals every scene she is in; half the story is truly hers.<br />I am happy to say that both Rosalie and Agnes get what they deserve, which is, fittingly, what each explicitly asked and worked for. (Read that any way you wish--or better yet, read the book.) &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; has left me believing that we truly do sow what we reap and receive what we ask for.	2001-10-05

Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession. <br />Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.<br />Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.<br />I am never tired of rereading this part.<br />The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)<br />There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family.	2001-10-05

In the first chapter of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, Jane Austen introduces Catherine Morland and pretends to apologize for having such an unromantic heroine. In the next few chapters, Catherine appears to live up to her creator's apology, while the author appears to forget all about telling us about the abbey for which her novel is named. <br />The presence of the two shockingly audacious and impudent Thorpes--John and Isabella--almost makes up for this. Never did I want to slap and/or kick two fictional characters more. The ways in which they try to foil Catherine's hope of romance with Henry Tilney--and arrange a marriage between the artful Isabella and Catherine's innocent, unsuspecting brother--are enough to make readers gnash their teeth. Ironically, the scenes with the charming Henry and his kind sister Eleanor ramble along in comparison to the explosive scenes &quot;graced&quot; by the outrageous Thorpes. <br />I liked the last twelve chapters better. Actually set in Northanger Abbey, they are a hilarious satire of the nineteenth century Gothic novel. Catherine stumbles into misadventure after misadventure (if I may be so generous as to call them such), thanks to her wild imagination and voracious novel-reading. It is wonderful to be caught in the excitement of a (pseudo) Gothic mystery that readers know is not real, but that they understand _could_ be real. It's the excitement of telling ghost stories around a campfire then trying to get to sleep. Everyone believes that anything could happen, though anything rarely does. It's nice, safe, thrilling fun.<br />In my opinion, Jane Austen was having so much fun herself, in writing these scenes, that she did not sufficiently develop the romance between Catherine and Henry. They have few scenes together and Henry's character is too agreeable to be as interesting as John Thorpe's--or even General Tilney's. (Jane Austen should have apologized for him instead of for Catherine. Henry Tilney is more a Mr. Bingley thana Mr. Darcy.)<br />Despite this, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; has the expected happy romantic ending--with the author still giving cheeky asides to the reader. I'd still recommend this book . . . but only after &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, of course.	2001-10-05

I would have given &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; four stars instead of five, because of all the issues left only half-explored or totally unexplored by Michael and Jana Novak. (For instance, barely anything was said about Eastern religions.) However, this book's shortcomings are not half as important as what this book can do for people.<br />&quot;Tell Me Why&quot; can start debate among believers and non-believers alike. It can inspire critical thinking among the most complacent readers. It can even bring about new joy and enthusiasm to those who need a boost to their faith.<br />Other reviewers have complained that the discussion &quot;degenerates into Catholic dogma.&quot; Being Catholic, I can assure other Catholics that this is a great book to read--and tell believers of other faiths that this is a book that will set them thinking about their own religious and spiritual beliefs. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; covers abstract issues, such as how to choose a religion and why it is important to believe in a Higher Power, and practical points, such as abortion and ritual--all explosive topics in their own ways.<br />To its credit, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; does not merely lay down Catholic doctrine and leave the reader, who may be unfamiliar with Catholicism, floundering for answers; it presents the philosophic background of each teaching. Doing so requires a lot of intellectual meandering, which is why Michael Novak can take over ten pages to answer a simple Yes or No question. (Of course, problems still crop up when Michael Novak explains something to daughter Jana's content, but not to the reader's.)<br />The text is sprinkled with quotes and prayers from figures such as C. S. Lewis, G. K. Chesterton, and other philosophers of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. (Michael Novak has a mind very much like a database when it comes to his field.) While reading, I often found myself thinking about unincluded others who have written about spritual and religious matters, such as M. ScottPeck or Kahlil Gibran. Though my experience proves that &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; is far from perfect or comprehensive, it also shows that this book _does_ inspire people to look into themselves in order to complete what the authors may have left unexplored.<br />We need more popular theology in our lives.	2001-09-12
US	47316940	R31XVPYWODGLSL	0553277472	340684550	Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values	Books	5	23	26	N	N	Resonance Required for Highest-Quality Experience	&quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; is an entire experience in philosophy and spirituality condensed into what I found to be a very thought-provoking anti-novel. It has three main &quot;streams&quot; of thought: the story of the motorcycle-riding narrator and his son, the story of Phaedrus, and the Chautauqua that is the narrator's way of explaining Phaedrus' philosophy. <br />Though the first two chapters of the narrator's musings are slow to bring the reader into the plot, intriguing mystery elements are revealed by the end of Chapter 3. By this time, the reader should know that Phaedrus spent his whole life searching for a ghost, found the ghost, &quot;thrashed it good,&quot; and became one himself. However, the nameless narrator cannot tell Phaedrus' story without also giving the reader a crash-course in history, philosophy, and of course, motorcycle maintenance (through the Chautauqua, of course). I now warn those who cannot bear long lectures about dead historical figures, slippery concepts or technical minutiae to leave this book alone. <br />Part I of the book is set chiefly in the Dakotas. During this part, the Chautauqua mostly discusses the classical-romantic split in people's thinking. What makes Robert M. Pirsig's discussions unique is how he deftly brings Zen concepts into the reader's understanding of the split. <br />Part II begins with the narrator's arrival in Montana. It is the reader's first real encounter with Phaedrus (an unforgettable, though hardly endearing, character) and the first introduction to the &quot;ghost&quot; that he so passionately pursued. (The ghost's name: REASON. One of its popular haunts: SCIENTIFIC METHOD.)<br />Part III takes place during and right after the narrator and his son's hike up a mountain. The chapters in this section are almost entirely devoted to the Chautauqua. The discussion of the ghost of Reason is dropped and a full, in-depth explanation of something outside Reason, Quality, is taken up.Pirsig takes great pains to say how Quality determines our values, creates our mythos and touches our hearts. Those who like taking detours when an interesting topic distracts them will love this part. Those who don't care for such detours and want to get on with the story will find this part long-winded and over-written. (This is their second warning!) <br />Part IV continues and ends Phaedrus' story as the narrator and his son go through Oregon and California. In the Chautauqua, Quality is joined by Reason once more. The reader finds out how Phaedrus travelled to the University of Chicago, took his philosophical inquiry to its logical end, and finally became a &quot;ghost&quot; himself. His conclusions about what is Real, about what is True, about what is Beautiful, and about what is Best, can prove liberating to anyone who has been independently wondering about them. The ending also contains an interesting twist in the story of the narrator and his son. <br />I can find connections between the ideas in this novel and those in the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the parables of Kahlil Gibran, the poetry of T. S. Eliot, the books of the Bible, and other great spiritual or philosophical literature that generations have read and shared. (Pirsig even explains the why and how of this phenomenon in the Chautauqua.) To best enjoy this story, the reader must relate to it--or resonate to it.	2001-08-26

The story is set in Occupied Denmark and told through the eyes of Annemarie Johansen, a 10-year-old girl who has to help save her Jewish friend Ellen. This novel humbly, simply and unsensationally honors the anonymous heroes and heroines of WWII.<br />However there are some elements and developments in the story that readers in Annemarie's age bracket may not understand. For example, at one point in the story, Annemarie discovers that sometimes it is okay to lie to your friends, in order to protect them. I'm sure that readers of this book will not grow up as quickly or as soon. In fact, readers and Annemarie may begin on the same level at the start of the novel, only to have Annemarie outpace them to maturity at the end.<br />There are also many beautiful but subtle nuances in the storytelling that may be confusing to young readers, such as Lois Lowry's many flashbacks and asides.<br />Moreover, readers who expect the kind of action and suspense found in &quot;The Giver&quot;, another Newbery Award-winning book by Lowry, will be disappointed. They may find the plot boring and Annemarie passive. The reason for this is that Annemarie is not in the middle of the action, the way her friend Ellen is, but really on the sidelines. This is a story told by an introspective, sensitive observer. What it lacks in thrills and excitement it makes up for in depth. Children who have read &quot;The Giver&quot; and have felt what it is like to be the one who has to leave, can read &quot;Number the Stars&quot; and know what it is like to be the one left behind.	2001-08-15

Conversely, &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; deals primarily with the gray areas. At the risk of sounding melodramatic and trite, I say that most of the Laws covered in this book can be used for great evil or for great good. It depends on the reader. There is really nothing wrong with most of the Laws per se.<br />Each Law comes with true stories from history about those who successfully observed it and those who foolishly or naively trangressed it. Robert Greene has an interpretation for each story. Though each Law is self-explanatory, Greene's explanations are not padding, fluff or stuffing to make the book longer. They actually give greater clarification and depth. Greene's insight even extends to crucial warnings about how the Laws could backfire. <br />There are two reasons to read this book:<br />1. For attack: To gain power, as have others who have carefully observed the Laws;<br />2. For defense: To be aware of ways that people may be trying to manipulate you.<br />As Johann von Goethe said (as quoted in &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot;, of course): &quot;The only means to gain one's ends with people are force and cunning. Love also, they say, but that is to wait for sunshine, and life needs every moment.&quot;<br />Those who say they have never used any of these laws are either being hypocritical--or lying.	2001-08-15

In &quot;Before the Story&quot;, an introduction to the novel, Jerry Spinelli writes, &quot;What's true, what's myth? It's hard to know.&quot; Was Maniac Magee really a superhero in an urban legend of childhood--or was he just an extraordinary, though very human, young boy? Again, even to those who have read the story several times, it's hard to know. I doubt if Spinelli himelf knows the answer. During Part I, for example, Jeffrey/Maniac is a boy in Chapter I, a legend in Chapter II, a boy in Chapter III, a legend in Chapter IV . . . you get the idea.<br />Even the rest of the characters have that half-unbelievable, half-real quality about them, though not as powerfully. For instance, few people have ever known an Amanda Beale who carries her entire library to school everyday; but it is easy to believe that _someone_ like Amanda does exist . . . somewhere out there. And most kids could interview all the old parkhands in their states and probably not find one who has struck out Willie Mays, or any other major league baseball player, for that matter. Yet it is still easy to believe that the novel's Grayson has a real-life counterpart. Beginning with Chapter One, when the first strange characters, Uncle Dan and Aunt Dot, are introduced, readers may suspend their disbelief and experience one of the most wonderful adventures in modern children's literature.<br />I call it an adventure because, whether he or the readers know it or not, Jeffrey/Maniac is on a quest. He is looking for a place to call home, a place where he can be accepted and happy. Readers follow him from his first home in Bridgeport to his final home in a place-you-will-have-to-read-the-novel-to-know-about. This quest is not the only mythical element in this great novel: the hero also has several tasks to perform and dangers to brave before he achieves his dream. Along with all his &quot;superpowers,&quot; he even has a &quot;fatal flaw&quot; to overcome: his naive nearsightedness when it comes to others.<br />Some of the tasks are as simple as undoing an impossible knot. Others are as &quot;dangerous&quot; as trying to make peace between blacks and whites in a neighborhood. Something else mythical is Maniac's experience in the West End, which can be called a &quot;Descent into the Underworld&quot;. Like a modern Odysseus, he makes many educational stops on the way to his own special Ithaca. (The three parts of the book mark these stops.)<br />All of this is told in Jerry Spinelli's beautiful prose, which sometimes nearly becomes poetry. For example: &quot;For most of November, winter toyed with Two Mills, whispered in its ear, tickled it under the chin. On Thanksgiving Thursday, winter kicked it in the stomach.&quot; At other times, the narrative seems to come straight out of a character's mind, with Spinelli taking on the voice of that character. <br />To top it all off, &quot;Maniac Magee&quot; has an excellent moral. (There are many little lessons scattered throughout the plot, but I will focus on the main one.) Interestingly, the novel does not make any fixed judgements on running away. First it seems to say that running away is not the answer and that homes must be worked on, as much as found. Then it reminds us that Jeffrey/Maniac would not have found his home had he not run away to look for it in the first place. <br />This story tugs at the heart and enriches the soul, but it also opens the mind.	2001-07-12

It contains makeshift altars and special names, made-up rituals and homemade costumes, &quot;modified&quot; hieroglyphics and even a new way to walk. Anyone who has ever invented his or her own special world, out of fascination or out of boredom, will understand the appeal of &quot;The Egypt Game&quot;. <br />While reading, I often thought that Zilpha Keatley Snyder had more fun writing about the made-up rituals than the characters had performing them. Not only are they fun, they are more or less well-researched, which is only right, as two of her characters are enthusiastic readers who pay attention to details. Throughout the story, Snyder's sense of humor shines through, whether she is making one character sprinkle ashes into his hair or making two other characters refrain from doing so, &quot;because to a girl even the death of a pharaoh isn't worth a dirty head.&quot; <br />Except for April Hall and Melanie Ross--and the Professor, of course--the characters are not very complex. They become part of Egypt not because they have something vital to add to the plot, but because they make the game more fun. Only a few of them go through a change that is apparent at the end of the story. However, their personalities are varied enough to contribute to the small conflicts in each chapter (this is a semi-episodic novel), and to let readers have different favorite characters.<br />The book has its darker parts, however. Part of the story involves the murder of some small children, and the murderer remains at large for most of the novel. (Even I found this extreme. The story could have been just as fun and mysterious without it.) Also, the idol worship and divination aspects of some of the games may be disturbing because they are very realistic and taken very seriously by the children. As for the Professor, his role in the story is so ambiguous at the beginning that only experienced readers will be able to tell, by the third chapter, whether the Professor is spooky or friendly, a bad guy or one of the good guys.<br />In spite of the drawbacks, I found &quot;The Egypt Game&quot; truly enjoyable and fun to read. I only wish that children had more books that stress the wonder of discovery, imagination, and good, old-fashioned play.	2001-06-02
US	47316940	R2MTF5KUD88OJ5	0060973617	984502839	Up the Down Staircase	Books	5	39	41	N	N	The Best Antinovel I've Ever Read	Don't be put off by my title. An antinovel is merely a book that rejects the traditional elements of a novel. In &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot;, the story is told through letters, memos, notes left in suggestion boxes, and scribblings in notebooks. Some people may consider the letters the clumsiest part of the novel, as they are too detailed and precise to have been written directly from the protagonist's memory (as they are supposed to have been). That is not the point, however, as this clumsiness is something you only notice after you've finished reading (hopefully), assuming that you're really into the story.<br />Like all other books about teachers-who-touch-the-lives-of-students, this novel is touching, poignant and funny--and properly depressing at the right times. It is also full of the strangest characters, teachers and students alike. Yet real life teachers will recognize their own students in the fictional ones and real life students will agree that the weird teachers in the novel are pretty realistic.<br />What makes &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; different from others of its kind (e.g. &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot;) is that even though it is &quot;messagey&quot;, it was not written by someone who had an axe to grind. Yes, Bel Kaufman exposes the terrible working conditions and lack of respect public school teachers get, as well as the poor education students are subjected to--but Kaufman is no Dickens! (Thank goodness!) The crusade to help teachers and students is put in the background, where it belongs; and the story of Miss Barrett, her students, and the other colorful people of Calvin Coolidge, remains in the foreground.	2001-04-02
US	47316940	RSPOIZAVL5LQ3	0553278223	726968599	The Martian Chronicles (The Grand Master Editions)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Portrait of Humanity by a Sci-fi Writer	&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is full of stories about what humanity does when it is let alone and thinks that no one is watching. As they are science fiction stories, the characters all have science on their side, helping them shape the world--nay, the solar system--to their ideal. It's not always a nice process. Over and over again, in each short story, the human qualities of the first ones on Mars, and even the qualities of those who remained on Earth, are exposed. Humanity certainly does not look pretty in this book. The men who landed on Mars were more ready to kill strange creatures than try to befriend them--more ready to destroy remnants of Martian civilization than preserve it. Even those with ideals were bent on wiping out those who thought differently from them. Those who remained on Earth were just as inclined to destruction. For them, the issue was nuclear war. Yes, the Martians did their horrible share of killing out of fear of the unfamiliar, but who are Earthlings to cry foul over that?<br />However, there are some stories about nice people (such as &quot;The Green Morning&quot; and &quot;The Million-Year Picnic&quot;). Other stories are more optimistic (&quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot;) and even whimsical (&quot;Night Meeting&quot;). One is even poignant without being too dark (&quot;The Long Years&quot;).<br />Though I found a lot of the parts about robots and telepathy really hard to believe (even for my gullible, credulous, Madeleine L'Engle reading self), I have to admit that the situations that involved these fictional conceptions made a lot of sense.<br />What I disliked most about this book was the lack of good female characters. The women who were in the stories just slumped and sighed around a lot, except the woman in &quot;The Silent Towns&quot;, who was purely disgusting.<br />What I liked most about &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; were the last two stories, &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; and &quot;The Million-YearPicnic&quot;. They gave the message that, despite all the destruction humans can bring about in five years--and on two planets--there is no reason to give up on humanity or for humans to give up on themselves.	2001-04-01
US	47316940	R1KTEEUEZ1HI9I	0440911710	335248947	Camilla (Laurel Leaf Books)	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Beautiful Bildungsroman	I've read &quot;Camilla&quot; during different stages in my life and have found new meaning in the novel each time. I have always loved the book for its rich imagery and descriptions of everything from New York's Central Park to a piano concerto by Prokofiev. I also love it for its strong protagonist, Camilla Dickinson, who can seem unbelievably perfect for a teenage girl. After all, she isn't just intelligent and sensitive, but she also has a sense of the cosmic and the beautiful. For instance, she reads the classics not because she is forced to at school but because she likes reading them.<br />Another thing fascinating about the book is that each character has his or her own take on what Life is. These philosophies are great to take apart when analyzing each character's motivations. Madeleine L'Engle is good at writing books with many different characters because she can give each one a different take on Life (as she does here), on Death (&quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;), on Love (&quot;A House Like a Lotus&quot;), and on Existence and the Universe (any book in the Time Quartet).<br />The plot is basically about how a young girl, in the course of a few weeks, becomes a young woman. The story is deeper and richer than that description, however. What makes &quot;Camilla&quot; stand out among other bildungsroman stories for young people is the fact that its protagonist's &quot;growing pains&quot; are less troubling and awful than usual, not because the author gave her a break, but because she had learned to cushion her fall into adulthood with a strong faith in the beauty and goodness in the Universe. If I could compare Camilla Dickinson to any other person, real-life or fictional, I would pick Anne Frank.	2001-03-27

This book should have been required reading in my PR class! Not only does it have comprehensive case studies of PR programs with all sorts of objectives (launching a new product, making old products look hip, etc.), it has a story for every PR tool I learned about in class. There is also a second part that shows how to plan a Marketing-PR program. <br />What I really like about this book is how it is so full of ideas. They are excellent mental triggers. I can open the book to almost any page, read about one company's PR program or tactic, and suddenly be filled with all sorts of ideas related to whatever I'm working on.	2001-03-24

When I read the synopsis on the book jacket, I assumed that Robin, the protagonist, was a lot like Whitey of the movie &quot;Boys Town&quot;, to be taught the right path by Brother Luke, who I deduced was the equivalent of Father Flanagan. I was wrong. Robin wasn't rebellious at all. This is one reason why the story does not bump along as much as it flows. (Its lack of conflict keeps it from bumping, but the author's lovely prose keeps it flowing.)<br />The setting is romanticized. There is nothing about the disgusting sounds, smells, habits, and parasites of the Middle Ages. If I had not read Cushman's &quot;Catherine Called Birdy&quot; (another good book) first, I would have thought that Medieval England was clean, pretty, quaint--and only a little muddy when it rained. Though things are protrayed as more lovely than they really were, I have to say that the attention to detail--from the handwritten manuscripts to a small town's market day--was amazing. I felt as if someone had tossed me several hundred years back in time and that Robin, Brother Luke, and John-go-in-the-Wynd were my guides who explained everything to me. It was a fascinating journey, though it took place in an armchair. (The original illustrations help a lot.)<br />The main characters are as real and as idealized as the setting is. What I mean is that they are three-dimensional and realistic, but also that they have halos and little wings. They are really, really good. To some, they may be boring; but if there were more people like them in the world, we would all be much happier. Brother Luke was a wonderful, patient and understanding mentor to young Robin. He always seemed to know exactly what to do to help Robin to maturity. I don't know how someone can finish the first few chapters and not like Brother Luke for the rest of their lives. Readers may also leave liking Robin, though they may find him too &quot;goody-goody.&quot; All I can say is that he was a naturally quiet, modest boy who was eager to please his father and serve his king. This did not make his struggle to gain self-mastery and to find the &quot;door in the wall&quot; any easier than it is for all the young people who have to go through it.<br />The premise is about how Robin found his door in the wall. Life walled him in, but he was taught to believe in himself and not give up. He learned woodcarving and even had some adventures. In the end, he learned that even a little lame boy can please his father and serve his king--if he really, really wants to. I think that if more young people who feel walled in by life read this book, then they will be better off, for the following reasons:<br />1. it will show them a beautiful world, where they can drop their cynicism and be young again;<br />2. it will give them, if only in their imaginations, a kind teacher in Brother Luke;<br />3. it will teach them about the door in the wall, and how all they need to do to find it is to look.<br />PS--If you're a teacher, please read &quot;Keeping Kids Reading&quot; by Mary Leonhardt before you assign this book.

It isn't just a story that falls flat--it's a story that was in bad taste before it was even set to paper. Yes, yes, I know that the novel has a powerful message that is helping to end child abuse and create more understanding of Multiple Personality Disorder. My point is that it is too obviously preachy--and Sheldon is not good with that. Probably the worst part of this book is his attempt to psychoanalyze and help Ashley, his tortured protagonist. (What a sad, pathetic protagonist she makes, too!) Though Sheldon has created a lot of psychos, he has never taken their psyches apart before--and this lack of practice is woefully apparent. (For a real psycho, one who was not used to create sympathy but to tell a great story, read &quot;Master of the Game&quot;.) In my opinion, Sheldon did not write this novel for his readers. He wrote it for a cause. It is a noble cause, yes--which is why there is information at the end of the book for those who want to help--but I have to wonder if Sheldon has run out of real ideas, which is why he is turning to causes for inspiration.	2001-02-07

Those who remember Katy as a tomboy who always tore her frock and ran holes in her hose will be pleasantly surprised when they see how she turned out. Yes, she did mature greatly at the end of the first book, &quot;What Katy Did&quot;, but the second book shows her as such a ladylike young woman that it will seem like she never ran around wildly as a child.<br />Katy and Clover go to boarding school where they make friends and have all sorts of adventures that only boarding school girls can have. (It is an episodic novel.) There are lots of funny stories about how school rules get broken and what it's like to live on the same floor as a strict teacher. A whole chapter is devoted to a wonderful game called &quot;WORD AND QUESTION&quot;. It is my favorite chapter of the book, since it is full of funny poems and funny situations. (Word and Question is also one of my favorite games to play.) Another chapter is all about the S.S.U.C., a club of which Katy is president. The acrostic unbelievably stands for &quot;Society for Suppression of Unladylike Conduct&quot;--for Katy, Clover and all the members are determined to be as ladylike and proper as possible.<br />Some people despair that Katy, who was such a wonderful tomboy, finally lost herself. They say that the book influences little girls who are like Katy to be someone they are not. Personally, I think that &quot;What Katy Did at School&quot; is not about a girl being something she is not. In fact, Katy is extremely self-possessed. I believe that the books &quot;What Katy Did&quot; and &quot;What Katy Did in School&quot;, when taken together, teach little girls that it is okay to be wild and free--but it is also okay to be ladylike. Anyone who says that Katy stopped having fun in this book has never read it, was never really a girl, or just has a personal bias against boarding schools.	2001-02-04
US	47316940	R19XRT9EN741LV	0671036025	730840886	San Francisco Earthquake,1906	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Okay--but not great	The first thing I'm going to say about Kathleen Duey is that she certainly did her research on the San Francisco of 1906. She has many details about what the streets looked like, what styles were in fashion, how corsets were put on, etc. The second thing I'm going to say about her is that her descriptions are very vivid. When I read her novel, I really saw San Francisco before the earthquake, heard the street sounds, etc. These reasons are why I gave the book three stars instead of two.<br />What I did not like about the novel is all the disjointed characters. Ms. Duey's point in having all of them was, I believe, to show exactly how the earthquake affected people from all walks of life. So those of you who are expecting a love story--thanks to the plot synopsis--should know that there are other stories in the novel, not just Joseph and Sierra's. Why the jacket copywriter of this book wrote that it was about a love that defied the odds, yadda, yadda, yadda--I don't know. It is really about more than that, so those who just want the love story will find fewer pages dedicated to it than they would like.<br />Speaking of the characters, even the most minor ones were more than two-dimensional cardboard figures (though just barely). However, the most important &quot;character&quot; was not a person, but the city itself. In this story, San Francisco, 1906, becomes more than just the background and setting, it becomes something dynamic and active. I liked that--and those who like seeing a place come alive will, too.	2001-02-04

When I'm feeling muddled about things, I still turn to it as a reference. I'm glad that I have it because it provides good SUMMARIES of the reasons to study philosophy, of the ideas of major philosophers, and of time periods in history. I capitalized all the letters in &quot;summaries&quot; to stress that these are all &quot;Sophie's World&quot; provides. For something really in-depth, don't turn to this book, which is more like a crash-course in philosophy. What makes this crash-course different from others, I must say, is that it illustrates how one philosophy made way for the next one, such as how philosophers in one era were inspired by thinkers who came before, how ideas were modified and expanded, how history shaped the way people thought and vice-versa, etc. Also, the philosophical discourses in the novel are dialogues between teacher and student which utilize the Socratic method, which is still the best way to start opening a student's mind. The problem crops up when Sophie understands a concept before the reader does. Since she has grasped it, Alberto no longer needs to explain, though the reader may still be dangling and desperate. Another problem with &quot;Sophie's World&quot; is that some parts are very boring, such as Alberto's explanation of how Newton arrived at the Theory of Gravity. <br />As a novel, &quot;Sophie's World&quot; is weird. At first it seems part-mystery story, since both Sophie and the readers have no idea who Major Knag and Hilde Moller Knag are. When the identities of these two figures are finally revealed, the story takes another strange turn. There are many other strange things about the story, such as the TWO ENDINGS (one is abrupt, the other is open-ended). Readers are left unsure about what the moral of the story is. Alberto and Sophie promise to reveal the meaning of life during their &quot;philosophical garden party,&quot; but do they really? Neither Alberto's final word on the subject nor the chaotic events that take place during the party (including people's reactions to them) make much sense. One has to wonder about the point of studying philosophy when &quot;graduation day&quot; seems to dismiss philosophy entirely. (Of course, like all things in philosophy, this is open to debate. Some people I know actually thought this ending made sense.)	2001-01-31

Only recently did I learn that it was, at one point, banned because of &quot;explicit sexual content.&quot; I had to laugh at this because the only thing sexual that happened in the story was something very natural to a young person's development. (Please remember that the protagonist is an adolescent.) It was also crucial to the story as it showed how the community attempted to stifle sexual and romantic feelings (this includes love) in its members.<br />I have to admit that there are parts of the book that are too heavy for younger readers. Aside from the above-mentioned situation, there is euthanasia and infanticide. Yet these things are necessary for the reader to really understand what the characters' lives are like. They are a community without feelings, without history, without the ability to cope with anything that is out of the ordinary. Only two people in the story, a young boy named Jonas and an old man known as the Giver, have feelings, emotions and true awareness. Only they can see colors and hear music and experience joy, anger, sadness and other feelings. In the end, Jonas is smart enough to use all the knowledge and information that he has received to do some good. Instead of letting the community continue to hide, he and the Giver carry out a plan that saves everyone. (At least, that is what the plan was supposed to do. The story ends without clearing up what happened to the community.)<br />The book teaches the necessity of sharing emotions--be they happy ones or sad ones. It teaches the importance of history and the richness of variety. Its ultimate moral lesson is that people cannot hide from the darker aspects of life, because in doing so they hide from all of life and ultimately from love as well. Then the darker aspects (euthanasia and infanticide, among other things) win anyway. We can't kill them by hiding from them: we have to take them head-on.	2001-01-31

Her descriptions of her characters and settings are illuminating. At the risk of sounding cliched, the reader is truly transported into another time and place. Part of the reason for this is that Fox can tap into both the physical and psychological traits of people, places and time periods.<br />Her characters are well-drawn and thought-provoking, if only because of the protagonist/narrator's reactions to them. What kind of men would work on a slave ship? Not all of them, according to Paula Fox, are monsters. Most of them are made up of histories, beliefs and opinions that an English class would relish to take apart and try to explain. Each of them has his own reason for being there and his own justification for what he is doing.<br />This book may be too heavy for young children, particularly the climax and the ending. The reason may be that Fox did nothing to diminish the horror and the evil that was inherent in the slave trade. Yet, as a novelist, she made room for complexity in human beings (none of her characters was a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out) and in situations. As a result, readers end up with a better idea of the slave trade than if they read a story with stereotypical racist characters written by a novelist with an agenda.	2001-01-29

Frankweiler (Yearling Newbery)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	An Adventure Story with a Twist	This was the first real novel I ever read on my own. It made me want to get lost in the Metropolitan Museum, too.<br />Claudia and Jamie ran away from home to prove something to their parents. For this reason, some parents may not want to read this story to their children, in case those children follow the characters' example. I think that if more runaways followed Claudia and Jamie's plan--which was well-thought out and well-carried out, not done in the passion of the moment--then they would get into less trouble. Parents also forget a crucial point: these two characters run away to a MUSEUM.<br />Claudia and Jamie end up learning new things every day. They join a class that is touring the museum. They visit the UN building. They go to a library to learn more about Michaelangelo. Most importantly, however, they learn how to be friends and not just brother and sister, or &quot;partners-in-crime&quot;.<br />I called this an adventure story with a twist because of the &quot;buried treasure&quot; element. Instead of finding a map and searching for gold, however, Claudia and Jamie discover a mysterious statue that could or could not have been sculpted by Michaelangelo and do all that they can to find out the truth about it. In the end, as in all good adventure stories, they find their &quot;treasure,&quot; using all the things they learned during their stay in the museum. <br />The story also has a moral that the author did not state explicitly as a moral. It is that Claudia did not really want to run away, she just wanted to be different, to have a secret. In the end, she does achieve her goal to be special, which is why she no longer needs to run away to find herself. She already knows who she is. The buried treasure was not just the secret, it was also her identity.	2001-01-29

For one thing, I never liked Harriet's lack of introspection. She was always looking at people but never really seeing them as anything more than characters to write about. As an author, Harriet would have interesting people in her stories and all sorts of far-out, imaginative, creative plots--all pretty two-dimensional, for that is how Harriet saw life. She never seemed to understand another element in people, one that helps them get along with others and still be individuals.<br />Many of the characters in this book were extremely fascinating. In the hands of another writer, their personalities could have been deeper and more profound. Louise Fitzhugh just makes some of them look like caricatures.<br />Of course, in the end, everything works out (read that however you wish) and Harriet, as the protagonist, learns all sorts of valuable lessons. I wonder if she realized the meanings of those lessons, however, because she did not write about her reactions to them. Most of her commentaries are short and dry. She does not reflect on things. To be extremely fair, I have to say that the readers do reflect on what happens to Harriet, whether or not she herself does so. This is why many people have come away loving this book and learning a lot from it.	2001-01-29

Like them, I discovered &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot; when I was very young, and I still love it. It is the kind of book you can read again and again as you grow up. Each new time it is read it can reveal new layers of meaning. When I first read it, I thought it was just an adventure story with a unicorn (a really great adventure story, of course). Then I began to see how it took a stand for love and against apathy. In the plot, Charles Wallace has to fight the Echthroi (evil forces). Writing this story was Madeleine L'Engle's own way of fighting the Echthroi, which really exist. Through her story, she warns us about not letting the &quot;Might-Have-Been's&quot; haunt us; she asks us to take a stand &quot;in this fateful hour&quot; against the &quot;powers of darkness.&quot; If this is too mystical for some of you to stomach, then you probably have not entered this author's world, which, like the Christian world, is teeming with angels and demons. In this world, everyone must choose sides.<br />This is a book that children should have on their bookshelves. It may be a little to heavy for them at first, but as they get older, the layers of meaning will begin to become apparent to them. I have given all my younger cousins copies of Madeleine L'Engle books for their libraries. That is one way I know of teaching them how to care about the past-present-future of the Universe.	2000-10-27
