There have been many \\"perfect\\" teams; that is, teams that went undefeated and untied en route to a consensus National Championship. USC itself has enjoyed their fair share of these kinds of wire-to-wire perfect seasons. But the stars have never been aligned for any team quite like the 2004 Trojans. First of all, they are the sixth team to be ranked number one in the nation from the pre-season polls through the bowl games. USC is the only team to do it twice. The 1972 Trojans, considered by many to be the greatest team of all time, accomplished the feat. But SC was also ranked number one from the end of the 2003 regular season through the bowls, and carried that right through 2004 without interruption. <br /> <br />The 2004 Trojans also boast the Heisman Trophy winner, two-time junior All-American quarterback Matt Leinart. His teammate, All-American sophomore running back Reggie Bush, was a New York finalist for the award. USC won a repeat National Championship, a feat rarely done. They are in the middle of a 22-game winning streak. They beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, a game that was previewed as the greatest game in college football history. The 1944-45 Army Cadets featured a similar winning streak and two Heisman winners, Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis. There are other teams that compare, but nobody has done it quite the way Carroll's team is doing it. <br /> <br />A few came close. The 1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers featured an undefeated regular season that included winners of the Heisman and Outland Trophies. They lost to Miami in the Orange Bowl. The 2003 Oklahoma Sooners looked to be on a similar path, but their Heisman winner, Jason White, faltered in the Big 12 championship game as well as the Orange Bowl. <br /> <br />In light of USC's recent dominance, it is worth consideringtheir place in history. Not just the current Trojans, but USC's football program going back to the beginning of the 20th Century. It is time to take the mantel of \\"greatest program in the history of college football\\" away from the struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and lay it squarely with the deserving new champions from USC. Furthermore, USC continues to lay claim to the greatest historical athletic program in college history, as well.  <br /> <br />The two-time defending National Champions are a dynasty. If Leinart returns for his senior year in 2005, they will be better than they were this season. Leinart will be a senior, the Heisman favorite (as he was all of this year), and a three-time All-American. He will walk away from his career with more honors than any player ever; three National Championships (?), two Heismans (?), the Johnny Unitas Award, the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Trophy, the Davey O'Brien Award, et al. He will probably be the number one pick in the NFL draft.  <br /> <br />The 2003-04 Trojans are very possibly the greatest two-year dynasty ever. If they win a third title in 2005, that will be a first. They lose a couple of linebackers, but aside from Leinart, Bush will be a junior, running backs LenDale White and Herschel Dennis return, the whole offensive line returns, the tight ends and receivers are back, and the defense will be, for the most part, experienced. The 2005 Trojans have the potential to be the greatest single-season team ever assembled, better even than the 1972 Trojans. Soph-to-be Jeff Byers was the nation's best lineman coming out of high school and could win the Outland Trophy before graduating. Soph-to-be linebacker Keith Rivers was the top prep at his position and may garner a Butkus trophy some day. If Leinart leaves for the NFL, USC will re-tool at quarterback with one of two blue chip recruits. <br /> <br />In 2005, John David Booty will be a red-shirt sophomore. He was the top prep quarterback in America at Louisiana's Evangel Christian High School. His competition? Mark Sanchez, the top prep quarterback in the U.S. at Mission Viejo High (the nation's number two team) in Orange County, California in 2004. USC has had the number one recruiting class in the country for three years in a row. Last year's was considered the greatest of all time. The 2005 class, which will be finalized in February, promises to be just as good. The pipeline is endless. In light of the fact that they will enter next season ranked number one, favored to win their third National Championship in a row, they are worthy of continued hype. Consider that if Troy runs the table in '05, their winning streak will probably be 35. With either Booty or Sanchez living up to the challenge, maybe with senior running back Bush winning the Heisman and starring with a cast headlined by juniors Rivers and Byers, the 2006 Trojans could challenge Oklahoma's 57-game winning streak of the 1950s. Now we are looking at four National Championships in a row, but wait, there is more. Booty could quarterback the team in 2006 and 2007. Sanchez would be a red-shirt junior and senior in 2008-09. Considering that the last two SC quarterbacks (Carson Palmer in 2002 and Leinart in '04) won the Heisman, USC could conceivably come away with four more of the trophies before the end of this decade. The scenario could be: <br /> <br />2005: Senior quarterback Matt Leinart, USC. <br />2006: Senior running back Reggie Bush, USC. <br />2007: Senior USC quarterback John David Booty, USC (Oklahoma running back Adrian Petersen will be a pro by then). <br />2009: Senior quarterback Mark Sanchez, USC. <br /> <br />Steven Travers is the author of the Best Selling \\"Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman\\".

There have been many \\"perfect\\" teams; that is, teams that went undefeated and untied en route to a consensus National Championship. USC itself has enjoyed their fair share of these kinds of wire-to-wire perfect seasons. But the stars have never been aligned for any team quite like the 2004 Trojans. First of all, they are the sixth team to be ranked number one in the nation from the pre-season polls through the bowl games. USC is the only team to do it twice. The 1972 Trojans, considered by many to be the greatest team of all time, accomplished the feat. But SC was also ranked number one from the end of the 2003 regular season through the bowls, and carried that right through 2004 without interruption. <br /> <br />The 2004 Trojans also boast the Heisman Trophy winner, two-time junior All-American quarterback Matt Leinart. His teammate, All-American sophomore running back Reggie Bush, was a New York finalist for the award. USC won a repeat National Championship, a feat rarely done. They are in the middle of a 22-game winning streak. They beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, a game that was previewed as the greatest game in college football history. The 1944-45 Army Cadets featured a similar winning streak and two Heisman winners, Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis. There are other teams that compare, but nobody has done it quite the way Carroll's team is doing it. <br /> <br />A few came close. The 1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers featured an undefeated regular season that included winners of the Heisman and Outland Trophies. They lost to Miami in the Orange Bowl. The 2003 Oklahoma Sooners looked to be on a similar path, but their Heisman winner, Jason White, faltered in the Big 12 championship game as well as the Orange Bowl. <br /> <br />In light of USC's recent dominance, it is worth consideringtheir place in history. Not just the current Trojans, but USC's football program going back to the beginning of the 20th Century. It is time to take the mantel of \\"greatest program in the history of college football\\" away from the struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and lay it squarely with the deserving new champions from USC. Furthermore, USC continues to lay claim to the greatest historical athletic program in college history, as well.  <br /> <br />The two-time defending National Champions are a dynasty. If Leinart returns for his senior year in 2005, they will be better than they were this season. Leinart will be a senior, the Heisman favorite (as he was all of this year), and a three-time All-American. He will walk away from his career with more honors than any player ever; three National Championships (?), two Heismans (?), the Johnny Unitas Award, the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Trophy, the Davey O'Brien Award, et al. He will probably be the number one pick in the NFL draft.  <br /> <br />The 2003-04 Trojans are very possibly the greatest two-year dynasty ever. If they win a third title in 2005, that will be a first. They lose a couple of linebackers, but aside from Leinart, Bush will be a junior, running backs LenDale White and Herschel Dennis return, the whole offensive line returns, the tight ends and receivers are back, and the defense will be, for the most part, experienced. The 2005 Trojans have the potential to be the greatest single-season team ever assembled, better even than the 1972 Trojans. Soph-to-be Jeff Byers was the nation's best lineman coming out of high school and could win the Outland Trophy before graduating. Soph-to-be linebacker Keith Rivers was the top prep at his position and may garner a Butkus trophy some day. If Leinart leaves for the NFL, USC will re-tool at quarterback with one of two blue chip recruits. <br /> <br />In 2005, John David Booty will be a red-shirt sophomore. He was the top prep quarterback in America at Louisiana's Evangel Christian High School. His competition? Mark Sanchez, the top prep quarterback in the U.S. at Mission Viejo High (the nation's number two team) in Orange County, California in 2004. USC has had the number one recruiting class in the country for three years in a row. Last year's was considered the greatest of all time. The 2005 class, which will be finalized in February, promises to be just as good. The pipeline is endless. In light of the fact that they will enter next season ranked number one, favored to win their third National Championship in a row, they are worthy of continued hype. Consider that if Troy runs the table in '05, their winning streak will probably be 35. With either Booty or Sanchez living up to the challenge, maybe with senior running back Bush winning the Heisman and starring with a cast headlined by juniors Rivers and Byers, the 2006 Trojans could challenge Oklahoma's 57-game winning streak of the 1950s. Now we are looking at four National Championships in a row, but wait, there is more. Booty could quarterback the team in 2006 and 2007. Sanchez would be a red-shirt junior and senior in 2008-09.

All indications are that Pete Carroll and his University of Southern California Trojans are poised to become the greatest collegiate team of all time.  <br /> <br />The defending co-National Champions have a dynasty on their hands. They could very possibly win two or three National Championships in a row.  <br /> <br />USC's last two recruiting classes were ranked number one in America, and the 2004 crop is thought to be the best in history. Not since the 1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers has a team entered the season with so many highlights. Therein lies the problem. <br /> <br />USC is the hottest ticket in America's hottest town, the toast of Hollywood, the biggest thing in a media hothouse. They set the all-time USC attendance record in 2003 and will likely break that in 2004.  <br /> <br />Based upon history, one is increasingly impressed with USC. Five years ago, a Top 25 listing of the Greatest College Football Programs of All-Time would have shown USC to have slipped. However, in light of their National Championship last year and favored status to repeat this year, Troy is now back to its second place status, poised to assault Notre Dame for the top spot in the next 10 to 15 years. <br /> <br />Long dynasties are hard to come by in college football, but SC has a long history of doing just that. It is for this reason, combined with the glow of being Notre Dame's biggest rival, its great inter-city tradition with UCLA, and a history that goes back farther than almost any program (Michigan and Notre Dame are the only schools that go back as far and are still powers) that Southern California is not just second all-time in football but first among all athletic programs (and first by a wide margin in baseball). <br /> <br />The Greatest College Football Team in history is generally considered to be John McKay's 1972 Trojans. In addition, SC claims the best single-season team in the 1920s (1928) and '30s (1931). They are considered the best team of the decade of the 1930s,1960s, 1970s, and now the 2000s. <br /> <br />Further proof of SC's ability to maintain a tradition is their consistency. The top dynasty period in history was the John McKay/John Robinson era lasting from the early 1960s until the 1980s. The Howard Jones \\"Thundering Herd\\" teams of the 1920s and '30s also ranks highly. Among the best three-year periods ever, none is better than SC's run from 1972-74. Among 5/6-year periods, consider three of Troy's eras (1967-72, the best of anybody, followed by 1974-79 and 1928-32).  <br /> <br />The best 10/15-year period? USC from 1967 to 1979, but that is not all. Also ranked is the period 1962-72 and 1928-39. Among great long-term dynasties (20/25 years), nobody beats Southern California from 1962-81, when they won five National Championships and four Heisman Trophies. The Trojans easily have the most professionals, the most first round draft picks, the most Hall of Famers, the most Pro Bowlers and the most All-Americans. They are, undisputably, a football factory. The empirical evidence cannot be argued against.  <br /> <br />On top of all this, USC counts the most Major League baseball players, the most baseball Hall of Famers, the most All-Stars and various dominant players.

It is for this reason, combined with the glow of being Notre Dame's biggest rival, its great inter-city tradition with UCLA, and a history that goes back farther than almost any program (Michigan and Notre Dame are the only schools that go back as far and are still powers) that Southern California is not just second all-time in football but first among all athletic programs (and first by a wide margin in baseball). <br /> <br />The Greatest College Football Team in history is generally considered to be John McKay's 1972 Trojans. In addition, SC claims the best single-season team in the 1920s (1928) and '30s (1931). They are considered the best team of the decade of the 1930s, 1960s, 1970s, and now the 2000s. <br /> <br />Further proof of SC's ability to maintain a tradition is their consistency. The top dynasty period in history was the John McKay/John Robinson era lasting from the early 1960s until the 1980s. The Howard Jones \\"Thundering Herd\\" teams of the 1920s and '30s also ranks highly. Among the best three-year periods ever, none is better than SC's run from 1972-74.

It is extremely appropriate to our current social situation, in which the Dumbass has crept out of the woodwork and made his presence known. His existence - who he is and the mindless, mocking, illiterate, ignoramus ways he spews forth words of stupidity - are identified, making knowledge of the fact that he is a Dumbass that with which is known by those who have access to facts. The Dumbass is able to get by in society by remaining silent, leaving question as to whether he is a Dumbass in doubt. When the Dumbass communicates with the general public, the question as to whether he truly is the Dumbass or not is no longer left to doubt. Anonymity is the best ally of the Dumbass. When the Dumbass exposes himself to the light of day, a large spotlight shines upon him. The spotlight says, \\"DUMBASS!\\" The Dumbass therefore confirms his Dumbassedness and his Dumbassedness becomes common knowledge to a wide swath of the general public, who upon hearing of the Dumbass consistently reach the general, rapid-fire conclusion, \\"Hey, there's a Dumbass!\\"<br />\\"Yeah, that's a Dumbass.\\"<br />\\"He sure as heck is. A Dumbass\\"<br />\\"Who is a Dumbass?\\"<br />\\"Can't you tell? Check out the this Dumbass.\\"<br />A few minutes to check out the Dumbass, followed by...<br />\\"Oh, how right you are. That's a Dumbass!\\"<br />The Dumbass often does not realize that he has been identified as a Dumbass, because he is a Dumbass. This is perilous for the Dumbass, because at this point, he lives like a snail on a straight razor, and his fate is not in his own hands. Those who have determined he is a Dumbass have the power to expose him as the Dumbass to a large portion of the public. The decision whether or not to expose the Dumbass is left to whoever has identified him as the Dumbass, not up to the Dumbass. He who has identified the Dumbass may expose the Dumbass at a time, place and setting of his own choosing. Whether he chooses to do this is never known by the Dumbass, who lives withthreat of exposure of his Dumbassedness for time immemorial. Only the possible benevolence of the one who has identified the Dumbass can save the Dumbass from exposure.  <br />The Dumbass often does not realize that he has been studied, as in the case of a Harvard/Yale study that took five years at a cost of $1 million. The determination of learned minds, upon analysis and incontrovertible evidentiary conclusion, is that the Dumbass is a Dumbass. Therefore, it is thus and decided: He is the Dumbass. At such point, there is nothing the Dumbass can do. He is the Dumbass and nothing he does or says can relieve him of the burden of Dumbassedness. All future attempts to speak, write, mock, belittle, make fun of, criticize, lamely try to be smart, make bad attempts at humor, copy, plagiarize and generally communicate with the world in any way simply magnifies his Dumbassedness. The Dumbass at this point has no choice whatsoever except to crawl into a hole and withdraw from all contact with the world, which is best left to those who can think, analyze and through excellence make the world at least safe for Dumbasses, who in olden times were tortured and met bad fates in non-American countries that were wickedly prejudiced against Dumbasses along with sex deviants, child molesters, and those deemed to be undesirable characters of poor morality.<br />Unfortunately, the fact that the Dumbass has been identified and now has knowledge that he is the Dumbass will probably not stop him from further action which identifies him as the Dumbass. This is because he is a stupid Dumbass. This makes him a sitting duck, because the facts are now known. Intelligent humans now know what to look for and how to determine who is the Dumbass. The instant he pops his head out of the shadows and makes any attempt at interaction, it is simply determined as fact that he is the Dumbass. He has been branded, and therefore it is.<br />The Dumbass resorts to drastic action, attempting to jealously bring down or reduce to his level those who are superior to him. Sometimes this leads the Dumbass to insanity or even suicide, but despite his human branding as Dumbass For Life, hope remains eternal even for the Dumbass, who despite everything is loved by God and forgiven by Christians even if though he has been identified as the Dumbass. The song \\"Amazing Grace\\" was about a Dumbass who, despite being wretched, was saved. The tricky part is for the Dumbass to recognize that he must ask for forgiveness, but God in his wisdom usually provides him just enough light to see Truth! <br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"<BR>(...)	2004-07-17

Michael Moore said he is an independent, not a Democrat, but this was exposed as just one of his lies when it was shown that he in fact is a Democrat. In 2004, he has veered from plain ol' anti-Americanism to Kerry's best hope. He is part of the &quot;new religion&quot; of modern media technology and is an example that works against his theme, which is that he is a censored artists, silenced by a Big Brother of corporate Republicans. <BR>Moore said Disney censured him by not distributing &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, but this is another lie. Their agreement was to help him produce it, never to distribute it. He used that line only to further the myth that he was restrained by corporate interests and found a huge distributor, Miramax. It was all part of his plan. Disney released another documentary, &quot;The Heart and Soul of America&quot;. &quot;Heart&quot; made no attempt to discredit &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;. It simply is an affirmation of true, good facts about this great nation. Moore called it the work of &quot;right wing extremists,&quot; which is like calling reporters who wrote about the Yankees' fourth World Championship in three years in 2000 &quot;Yankee propagandists.&quot; Speaking of things in New York, Moore expressed anger at the terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center. That makes sense, but wait. He was frustrated that they chose to kill New Yorkers, since the Democrats are strong in the Big Apple. He would have preferred Osama to have killed people in a Republican stronghold. New evidence has surfaced that anti-American Leftists plan to disrupt law enforcement during the Republican convention. The Left is not just a &quot;useful idiot&quot; of terror but an accomplice. Is commentary really necessary? <BR>Moore is, in reality, an example of how, as America has become the dominant power in world history, our themes - freedom of press, of expression, of dissent - are not censured but allowed to magnify. <BR>What the Left does not understand is thatthe likes of Moore do damage to the Democrats, and are of great value to the Republicans. They forget that their anti-war protests in the 1960s did not win them any elections but gave them instead Nixon and Reagan landslides. Actually, they may understand it, but they are obsessive-compulsives who cannot control their impulses.<BR>While Moore is not part of mainstream Hollywood, he is certainly part of the dominant media culture that the film industry embodies. Moore's documentaries get bravura responses from Hollywood and Cannes. <BR>What Hollywood just does not understand is what kind of economic windfall they would reap if they made conservative-theme films. If they depicted the bad politicians as actual Democrats, the word of mouth among conservatives would fuel boffo box office. On the few occasions when they stray to the right, as in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; franchise, they reap a whirlwind of success.<BR>What Democrats do not grasp is that Moore is a terrible role model, and that true knowledge of who he is, combined with the fact that he is a spokesman for their party (whether he owns up to it or not) is simply a negative reflection of that party. This fact is obvious on its face and needs no commentary from the right. I will offer more anyway.<BR>For years, Moore's work has been discredited, whether it be his documentaries or his books. Those who have seriously studied his work have consistently found him to be a liar in the main. He is a propagandist who takes 15 percent of truth, 70 percent lies and 15 percent exaggeration, and attempts to foist it off as journalism. The fact that he is a darling of the Left is as telling a true statement of their wacko views as any. Moore is the torch-carrier of Emma Goldman. He wishes he was Hunter Thompson, a gonzo journalist and a real talent, but he is a pale imitation. <BR>To believe Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; (the title stolen without permission from Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;), one mustaccept the fact that George Bush knew about 9/11 ahead of time; allowed it in cahoots with Osama bin Laden and the Saudi royal family in order to justify the long-desired American invasion of the Middle East; spirited bin Laden's legitimate family out of the country because they were part of the plot (which would be done to bring oil profits to the Bush family while satisfying their personal vengeance against Saddam for attempting to kill Bush 41). The fact that Bush 41 invaded Kuwait to oust Saddam in 1991, then left without the so-called oil grab, combined with the fact that Bush 43 is in the process of leaving Iraq without the so-called oil grab (again), are just the first two of 6,778 pieces of factual evidence that have been determined by the world to discredit Moore's work as lies.<BR>After &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11's&quot; first weekend, the liberal press hit us with big headlines telling us that it &quot;broke records&quot; and is reaching the largest audience in history, selling out theatres and influencing the election. It may have sold out theatres, but only because it played in a limited number of art houses. The fact is, it made $21 million. &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; made $117 million in its first weekend. The truth is that &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; finished with the 228th best opening weekend ever, just behind &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;. They were right about one thing, though. It will influence the election. In favor of Bush. <BR>Still, Moore is a hero of the Left. Because of all the historical reasons cited herein, because they are desperate and see their only source of joy, political power, being pulled away from them more and more each day, they are beyond the Truth. They lie, and we have little choice but to be merciful for those who lie. This charade, however, is getting tiresome.<BR>These Truths remain self-evident.

It was about the Fox News Channel, which is a fair, balanced news organization that roots for America. The Left says they are conservative. They are not. They just look that way compared to the liberal CNN, CBS, and most of the other network and cable stations (except for MSNBC). Fair and truthful analysts have concluded that Fox is the most believable and trusted news organization. Fair and truthful analysts concluded that Franken's book was, like Michael Moore's books and documentaries, filled with lies and half-truths. Franken was fed information by the Democrat-leaning Kennedy School of Government, and funded by George Soros, a socialist billionaire, who started Air America. Air America failed immediately. Conservative talk radio succeeds where liberal talk radio fails because conservatives, like Christians, are starving for Truth and decency in a world of anti-Americanism, religious intolerance and negativism. Conservatives are more likely to be educated people who prefer to improve themselves by learning about the world by listening to talk radio. Liberals are more likely to be old '60s rockers who prefer to listen to Santana and The Grateful Dead on FM. Res ipsa loquiter. <br />Throughout the Cold War, does anybody really doubt that, all else being equal, the Communists &quot;voted&quot; for Democrats over Republicans? Is their any doubt that terrorists prefer Democrats to Republicans? Is commentary really necessary? Res ipsa loquiter.<br />Hollywood and the rock'n'roll world is solidly Democrat. This is a world of drug abuse, alcoholism, adultery, divorce, homosexuality, atheism and immorality. The country 'n' western community is overwhelmingly Republican. This is a world of religion, family values, patriotism, respect for the military and overall morality. Res ipsa loquiter.<br />Time has forced many historical facts to recede in our collective memory, replaced by afuzzy kind of Leftist thinking that has even romanticized Communism among our youth, who do not always know the complete facts. How else to explain the popularity of Che Guevara t-shirts and posters? Some celebrities - Chevy Chase, Oliver Stone, Steven Spelberg, to name just a few -  have gone so far as to travel to Cuba and meet with  Castro, returning with glowing reports about the Cuban dictator's &quot;charisma&quot; or some such malarkey.  <br />Based on the undeniable Truths of empirical evidence, one is left to determine the simple fact that those aligned with the right are more likely to be good and decent people, while people aligned with the Left less likely to be. To deny this is to be a sophist and rely on various and sundry lies, identifiable by those who can read, write, see and have access to facts. Franken is another of these leaches who eat away at traditinal goodness, using the youth's ignorance as his weapon.<br />Forgive me my tresspasses as I forgive them theirs. <br />STEVEN TRAVERS<br />AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STRAVERSCA@AOL.COM	2004-07-15

I have a friend who won an Oscar for editing &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. A few years ago, he drove his girlfriend to the bank in downtown Beverly Hills. Parking being what it is in the B.H., my man waited in the car while his girlfriend went in to do her banking. My pal, being a big-time Doors fan, popped in a tape, which played &quot;The End&quot;, loud. It was hot and the window was down. Jim Morrison was wailing about how he &quot;took a face from the ancient gallery and...walked on down the haaaaalll, yeah...&quot;<br />Suddenly, Danny Sugarman, one-time Doors assistant, now married to Iran-Contra ingenue Fawn Hall, and the author of &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, appeared at the window, surprising my friend.<br />&quot;Are you looking for me?&quot; he asked my friend.<br />It seems that Sugarman had an appointment in the area but could not find the address. Hearing The Doors playing loudly, he figured it was a siren song, like the wailing of the mermaids drawing Ulysses to the rocks, meant to say to him, &quot;Hey man, I'm over here.&quot;<br />Somehow this is a story that resonates in the memory of Jim Morrison, who is as much legend and hype as a great rock star and poet. Morrison may have been the sharpest rock singer ever. The son of a Navy admiral who was in charge at the Gulf of Tonkin, while growing up he would invite friends into his room and close his eyes.<br />&quot;Pick a book,&quot; he would tell friends, gesturing to his shelves, which were stocked with thousands of titles.<br />&quot;Go to any page,&quot; he would say. &quot;Read any line.&quot;<br />His friends would do that, and Jim could always tell them the name of the book and the author. That is a genius.<br />Sugarman's work captures the genius and charisma of Morrison. It is, along with his other book, &quot;Wonderland Avenue&quot;, just possibly the best rock book ever.<br />Steven Travers<br />Author of &quot;Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman&quot;<br />straversca@aol.comca@aol.com	2004-07-14

In 2004, he has veered from plain ol' anti-Americanism to Kerry's best hope. He is part of the &quot;new religion&quot; of modern media technology and is an example that works against his theme, which is that he is a  censored artists, silenced by a Big Brother of corporate Republicans. <br />Moore said Disney censured him by not distributing &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, but this is another lie. Their agreement was to help him produce it, never to distribute it. He used that line only to further the myth that he was restrained by corporate interests and found a huge distributor, Miramax. It was all part of his plan. Disney released another documentary, &quot;The Heart and Soul of America&quot;. &quot;Heart&quot; made no attempt to discredit &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;. It simply is an affirmation of true, good facts about this great nation. Moore called it the work of &quot;right wing extremists,&quot; which is like calling reporters who wrote about the Yankees' fourth World Championship in three years in 2000 &quot;Yankee propagandists.&quot; Speaking of things in New York, Moore expressed anger at the terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center. That makes sense, but wait. He was frustrated that they chose to kill New Yorkers, since the Democrats are strong in the Big Apple. He would have preferred Osama to have killed people in a Republican stronghold. New evidence has surfaced that anti-American Leftists plan to disrupt law enforcement during the Republican convention.

In 1943, the U.S. Navy intercepted word that Josef Stalin was going to sue for a separate peace with Adolf Hitler. They also discovered that Alger Hiss, a leading New Deal Democrat and top advisor to President Roosevelt, was a Soviet spy. In addition, numerous high-level Democrats in FDR's Administration were Soviet spies and \\"fellow travelers.\\" They approached FDR, whose response was \\"f--k off.\\" The Navy, during this time of greatest national security threat, reached the conclusion that the Democrats could not be trusted!  In response to this, they began the Venona Project, designed to read all the Soviet cable dispatches. Venona continued to confirm that the American government and society was rife with Soviet espionage from within the ranks of the anti-American Democrat Left.<br />When the war ended, the Republicans began to investigate these rumors. Richard Nixon asked FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to assist. Hoover told him he could not let him view Venona because it was too important to the on-going Cold War vs. Soviet Communism, but that Nixon's instincts, particularly about Hiss, were right. Hiss was convicted. Numerous Leftists were convicted or exposed, as were many in Hollywood. When McCarthy went after them, the Left attempted to discredit him. Venona would have justified him, but Hoover refused to disclose Venona's secret. McCarthy was sacrificed and allowed to twist in the end, and for decades the Left proffered the lie that there were no Communists in Hollywood, the government, the Army or in America. <br />After Ronald Reagan won the Cold War, Soviet archives were opened. Venona was discovered and became the Venona Papers. It verified that Hiss and all the accused and convicted Communists in Hollywood, the government, the Army and in America were in fact Soviet spies or \\"fellow travelers.\\" One of those fellow travelers had escaped to Russia, but returned when the Statute of Limitations ran out. He returned to the U.S. in 1996. He was asked why.<br />\\"To vote for Bill Clinton,\\" he replied.<br />Is further commentary really necessary?(...)	2004-07-14

The question is whether the Monica Lewinsky scandal rose to the level of an Impeachable offense. Technically it did, but Senate Republicans said it was not serious enough to remove him from office. But the bottom line is that the American right believed that Clinton got away with many more serious crimes in Arkansas and in the White House. This included the \\"Clinton body count\\"; Mena; Whitewater; the Riady scandal; the Communist Chinese spy/fundraising scandals; drug dealers at White House parties; assaults and sex harrassment of women; character assassinations; illegal campaign contributions; affairs; Hillary's $1000 investment that in 30 days became 100 grand; and various other misdeeds. Conservatives were unable to pin any of it on the Clintons. Were they guilty of all of it? Probably not. Most of it? Maybe. It was frustration over his ability to get away with what he did get away with that pushed the conservatives into going after him on something they could nail him on.<br />(...)	2004-07-12

Fair enough, and I cannot argue that point. But at the same time, there are aspects of Machiavellianism, which actually is now called realpolitic more than Machiavelli, that are essential in modern politics, especially campaigning and warfare, or more appropriately, the politics of pre-war.<br />The crux of the author's advice to the The Prince is that it is better to be feared or respected than loved, which certainly parallels America's post-9/11 place in the world. There are times in which it is appropriate and better to be loved, but obviously this is a calculated act. It reminds me of how the Clintons did polling to determine what would be the most popular place to vacation for them with the public, or how after Moncia they &quot;allowed&quot; cameras to &quot;capture&quot; them, &quot;cuddling&quot; in bathing suits, or how Clinton walked into Ron Brown's funeral telling a big you-know-what-eating joke until he saw cameras, then wiped a fake tear from his eye.

He was troubled, and did not like his step-father. He read an ad or heard about a rock band in Hollywood that was hiring a teenager to answer mail, so he went for and got the job. The band was The Doors. Getting from Westchester to Hollywood by bus is not all that easy, but he did it just about every day. Jim Morrison befriended him and told him not to let his parents addle his brain with Ritalin, an ironic anti-drug message coming from the Lizard King.  <br />As a teenager, Sugarman accompanied Morrison on sojourns to the Sunset Strip, where despite his minority he was admitted to the rarified air of The Doors, The Byrds, and other classic California bands. His step-father was appalled.<br />Remarkably, despite his lifestyle, Sugarmnan was good enough at baseball to be offered a scholarship of some kind to play at UCLA, but his commitment to the band tugged at his dedication for the game, so he never went the diamond route.<br />As Morrison went downhill, so too did Sugarman. Unlike the song \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\", Sugarman managered, barely, to escape. After Jim's death, Sugarman picked himself up and lived in a house on Wonderland Avenue. It was all set up by Ray Manzaerek, the Doors' keyboardist extraordinaire. Manzarek, the \\"sensible one\\" among The Doors, wanted to continue the band, or at least his own musical career. Sugarman was hired to be the band's manager, and it was a lucrative life for a guy still in his early 20s. He quickly found himself drawn back into the sordid life of drugs, alcohol, sexual excess, and the like. The Wonderland address did not help, it being a small enclave off of Laurel Canyon, the famed street that connects West Hollywood with the San Fernando Valley. Its narrow canyons and streets are dotted with picturesque homes that embody the California Dream, and are inhabited (especially then) by those artists whose labors have born fruit. The Sharon Tate murders occurred in the general vicinity. Wild, loud parties were so commonplace that neighbors hearing the screams of Charles Manson's victims thought it was just another bash. John Holmes would be involved in a massacre there in the '80s. Later, this would be the area where Heidi Fleiss connected porn with Hollywood money.<br />Sugarman, who eventually would marry Iran-Contra ingenue Fawn Hall, lived with his gorgeous girfriend and lived the life. Aside from The Doors, he also managed the unbeliavable Iggy Pop. Once at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool, Iggy was sunning himself next to \\"Gilligan's Island\\" icon Tina Louise. Iggy plopped his manhood from out of his floppy shorts, showed it to Ms. Louise, and asked sardonically if she would care for a shag of the old English sausage. Tina politely declined. <br />The book describes one after the other of Sugarman's friends and associates meeting the Grim Reaper, and in the end he lists pages of names - musicians, producers, groupies, enemies, friends, girfriends, agents, and others - who died of drug overdoses in the pre-AIDS, pre-Cocaine-is-addictive era.<br />The message of this book is that despite glamour and fun, it is essential to be grounded, and one must do whatever he or she can to find that center.<br />(...)	2004-06-25

Watch the documentary. But above all listen to the audio book on tape. Bob Evans' voice is magic. A few years ago he did ads for the NFL, talking about how &quot;Broadway Joe&quot; Namath popularized the league by beating Baltimore in Super Bowl III. It was one of the best commercials ever. When Evans speaks, there is a richness and storytelling quality to his voice that cannot be taught. It is a combination of God-given talent and years of stories so wild, so crazy that no matter how outrageous they are, one still feels Evans is holding back because the real truth is just beyond the pale.<br />Evans' life is beyond comprehension. Luck above and beyond all belief, combined with talent and drive. The son of a Jewish New York dentist, Evans was a film buff and teenage stage actor. His older bro Charles started Evans-Piccone, the lucrative clothier, and Bob hitched along for the ride, wealthy in his early 20s and acting a part of his past. He travels to L.A. on business, and a famous actress sees him and decides he is the man to play the role of her ex-husband, Irving Thalberg, in an upcomng film, which he stars in.<br />Back in New York, he is discovered a second time, this time by Daryl Zanuck, who sees him in a club and says he is the man to play Pedro Romero in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. Pictures of Evans reveal that these discoveries are no accident. The dude was so handsome that words cannot do him justice. Ernie Hemingway was non-plussed by Evans, as were his famous co-stars who conspired against him to get him off the movie. Zanuck arrives, sees Evans play the bullfighter, and says &quot;The kid stays in the picture.&quot; The story of his life.<br />Stardom follows? Not so fast. Old footage reveals that despite his looks his acting talent was, in Evans' words, <BR>&quot;half-assed.&quot; So now what? Evans decides to become a producer. He buys rights to a book to film with Frank Sinatra in the lead and a promising producing career lies ahead. In 1966-67, he is hired to take over the failing Paramount. This is portrayed as an accident, luck, a fluke, but Evans does not give himself credit. He had brains, creative genius, charisma, looks and all the tools for Hollywood success, so his ascension is less remarkable than it would seem for a guy who is only about 30.<br />It immediately becomes apparent, though, he was hired to fail. The suits in New York just want a young face to deflect criticism of them as they fold Paramount. But Evans wins them over with a short of the upcoming &quot;Love Story&quot; and &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot;. Reprieve. In the '60s, Evans produces gems. Add to the above &quot;True Grit&quot;, &quot;Odd Couple&quot; and other classics. Money rolls in, but Evans does not get super rich and is always on the hot seat.<br />He marries the beautiful Ali McGraw and has the world by the tail. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is given to him, and he decides Sicilian mob pictures fail because they lack Italian authenticy.<br />&quot;I want to smell the spaghetti,&quot; he says.<br />Francis Ford Coppola, is the only Italian director at the time. It is tempestuous to the extreme, and when &quot;The Prince&quot; wins the &quot;Patton&quot; screenplay Oscar he cannot be fired. Evans claims he saved the film by making it longer, Coppola scoffs at the notion to this day. Two brilliant minds. Evans leaves Ali to the charms of Steve McQueen on the set of &quot;The Getaway&quot;, and she leaves him.<br />&quot;A man who thinks he knows the mind of a woman knows nothing,&quot; Evans opines.<br />His pal is Henry Kissinger, who Evans talks into coming to &quot;The Godfather&quot; premiere in the middle of the mining of Haiphong Harbor. Evans goes on to make &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;Marathon Man&quot; and most of the important films of Hoillywood's greatest era, the 1970s. He squires women who are so beautiful that it makes men drool. In the documentary, a TV host asks about it, and Evans claims to livelike a monk with no life, working 24/7. As he says this a montage opf models, actresses and beauties on his arm puts the lie to this story.<br />Evans falls into a coke habit and gets involved with shadowy people associated with the murder of a Hollywood wannabe. He loses everything, almost including his sanity and life. Near-uicide. Drug addiction. Insanity. Debt. The loss of his house. Another Hollywood casualty.<br />But with the help of his pal Jack Nicholson, Evans comes back, gets his house back, again makes big pictures, and stays very much in play with the ladies. <br />The kid stayed in the picture.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>...	2004-06-25

What the book centers on are two things, mainly, which is the growth of new talent coming out of the four big film schools of the 1960s (USC, UCLA, NYU, Columbia) and the development of the blockbuster, which eventually degraded character development as the staple of winning screen formula.<br />Descriptions of parties at Margo Kidder's Malibu beach pad are awesome. Here all the young Turks gathered - Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Paul Schraeder, Francis Ford Coppola, Marty Scorsese, etc. These SC, UCLA and NYU minds formulated \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Apocalypse\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"Jaws\\" and so many others.<br />While the sex and drugs got out of hand at Margo's, John Milius would repair to the beach and fire his weapon. Considered the best and the brightest of all of them coming out of SC, Milius was the lone conservative, who tried to stay clean. He would write great movies like \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"Apocalypse\\", and direct \\"Red Dawn\\" and \\"The Wind and the Lion\\". His stuff is just fantastic, but he never went on to the fame of his contemporaries.<br />Eventually, blockbusters like \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" contributed to the so-called \\"cartoonization\\" of Hollywood. The comparison of psychology, dialogue, structure and symbolism as seen in \\"Marathon Man\\" and \\"Chinatown\\" are replaced by graphics, as seen in \\"Star Wars\\", or by a giant mechanized shark.<br />The end of the era is the failure of \\"Heaven's Gate\\", which brings down its studio and leads eventually to the rise of independent films. <br />This book tells the story of the integral American art form in all its glory and ugliness.	2004-06-25

It includes tremendously creative, wonderful writing, but in the light of retrospection much of it is reduced to gratuitous pornography. When it was written in the 1930s, Miller's graphic sexual content was considered avant-garde, shocking and artistic. It was banned for this reason until 1961. This was the best thing that could have happened to Miller and the book, creating a cause celebre. But reading it in 2004, it is rather incoherent and, if it came out today, it would not hold up to scrutiny the way Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe stand the test of time. Miller's \\"cancer\\" appears to be a cancer of the soul. His descriptions of Parisian life in the 1930s - the whore houses, the scum, the thieves, liars and morally corrupt - describe an eating away of goodness, the way real cancer eats away at bone, skin and body. Reading Miller, one wants to shout, \\"Get this man to a church.\\" Liberals would excoriate this sentiment as judgment, which of course has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the one thing that could have saved Miller from his moral atrophy is and always will be the Lord Jesus Christ!<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<br />AUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"<br />(...)	2004-06-24

The 1920s were a strange time. John Reed?s \\"Ten Days That Shook the World\\" reached a large audience in the United States and internationally. Many wanted to know why an entire planet could be thrust into war. In an attempt to address that issue, some decided that nationalism, governmental agendas, realpolitik, racism, class warfare, capitalism, Democracy, and corporations in bed with politicians and militarists were to blame.  Nationalism was part of it. German unification and Balkan nationalism played a role. Governmental agendas and realpolitik always have played a role in conflict. Since Communism addressed the concept of \\"one world government\\" and a \\"world without borders,\\" some concluded that Communism offered the answer to these problems.  Racism was never an original part of the war, but would emerge as an ugly by-product. The Turks unleashed an open can of worms resulting in \\"ethnic cleansing\\" and genocide pitting Christians against Muslims, Turks against Arabs, secular vs. religious. In Germany, an easy scapegoat began to emerge: The Jews. Lies began to spread that Jewish banking interests profited from the war. In the American South Jewish influence was an affront to their sensibilities. The Ku Klux Klan rose again after a period of dormancy. The KKK?s \\"mandate\\" pitted them against a \\"worldwide Jewish conspiracy\\" somehow in league with Papal domination. They said Catholics pledge allegiance not to the U.S., but to the Vatican. But few Catholics and fewer Jews lived in the South. Many blacks did. They were becoming a more prominent segment of society. Blacks were emerging as professional athletes in the Negro baseball leagues, and as musicians in the jazz world. As they asserted themselves, this infuriated the white underclass.  But the most pernicious thing that emerged out of World War I were Westerners who believed that the war had occurred because of the failure of capitalism, Democracy, and corporations who were in bed with politicians and militarists. When Reed?s book came out, a segment of society allowed themselves to believe that the new political system in Russia should be given a chance. Communism became \\"the answer\\" to society?s many problems, including racism and poverty. The failure of Communism, already evident by 1920, was not exposed to the world. Reed either chose not to write about the thousands and thousands of famine victims, the secret police, the crackdowns and forced marches, the banishments, assassinations and disappearances, or he was controlled by the hierarchy, and not allowed to see it. He probably did not want to see it. He had found his story and he was going to stick to it. The great failure of the free press, of governments and political figures, of humanists and truth-seekers, was the failure to pin Russia - Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and the rest of them - down before they became too powerful. To expose them for what they were.  STEVEN TRAVERS  AUTHOR OF \\"[...]\\"  ...	2004-06-24

They included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, who once said of Oakland, California, \\"There is no there there.\\"<BR>  Hemingway was a reporter for the Kansas City Star, a man's man of gruff, Midwestern sentiment. He came from a family of some local prominence. Perhaps because he did not face great hardships growing up, he felt the need to test himself. In this regard, Hemingway and Teddy Roosevelt have much in common. Hemingway went looking for his manhood in World War I and found it. The experience formed him. He saw action fighting alongside the Italian allies and sustained wounds. According to his own account, he had a \\"life-after-death\\" episode. While recovering, he fell in love with a pretty American nurse. When the war ended the romance did not take, in part because Hemingway had a stubborn streak of jealousy. But he used these events to launch a career of great works, writing in a tone of melancholy wistfulness, imbued with American patriotism and the manly need to face danger, romance and adventure with courage and idealism, tinged by ironic cynicism.<BR>\\"A Farewell to Arms\\" was his semi-autobiographical account of World War I, including his lost love with the nurse. Hemingway captured the \\"lost generation\\" in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", which detailed American ex-patriates in Europe who were mentally and physically scarred by the Great War. His main character is unable to consummate a relationship with a beautiful woman who pines for him, because he sustained injuries in the war that prevent him from sexual functioning. The woman goes on to a career of carnal conquest with a variety of men, none of whom fulfill her. Amid much drunkenness and debauchery, the book addresses anti-Semitism, a relatively new theme in the 1920s, although Hemingway is not wholly sympathetic to Jews. When the book was made into a film in the 1950s, Daryl F. Zanuck cast a handsome young Jewish man, Robert Evans, as a Spanish bullfighter. When Evans approached \\"Papa\\" Hemingway at Yankee Stadium, the old man rebuffed him. He was furious that one of his beloved characters, a Spaniard, be portrayed by an American Jew.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"<BR>(...)	2004-06-24

Southern writers became a breed unto themselves. Erskine Caldwell described the hardscrabble life of &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. William Faulkner wrote about violence and sin in the Old South, although his verbiage is very difficult to follow. Thomas Wolfe infuriated Southerners with his rejection of their ways, but ultimately his work in &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; pays ironic homage to his roots. H.L. Mencken, editor of the American Mercury, became a leading voice of crabby intellectual conservatism, ridiculing prejudice and ignorance.

Bush, &quot;Don't let the turkeys get you down.&quot; This is sage advice of the highest order, and applies to all people, famous or not. This is the Ronald Reagan that Peggy Noonan writes about.<br />Reagan was excoriated during his time, but he never became petty. The way he handled criticism is a model for the way all good people should handle criticism. The Reagan model is to stay positive and upbeat, no matter what the drumbeat of stupidity is.  To follow his example is to stay above the fray, to maintain the Christian principle &quot;forgive me my tresspasses, as I forgive those who trespass against me.&quot; The lessons that average people can learn from Reagan is that if you are a good and decent person, even if the small people, the various and sundry pizzants of the Dumbellionite Class, the ignoramuses, the people of low moral character, the dregs and the ne'r'do'wells attempt to mock you, to bring you down to their level, to react with jealousy at succeses they are unable to achieve, simply continue on a path of honesty and good works. Forgive them and let not your heart be troubled.<br />God bless Ronald Reagan.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>...	2004-06-23

But Reagan was not afraid to air his opinions, to put his name and his face on his words. The world is filled with people who skulk in the shadows, hiding behind a veil of secrecy, spewing critcisms and non-entities under the guise of anonymity or assumed aliases. Reagan dealt with these kinds of low people when he was dealing with Communists in Hollywood. He triumphed over his critics in a manner that all people of goodness, conscience and honesty can learn from. He was proud of his accomplishments, and continually strove to do the right thing despite the bickerings and mutterings of those who were not pimples on his rear end. This is a fine lesson to learn from his letters. He was himself always - upright, proud, never hiding from his purpose but always willing to take full responsibility for himself.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<br />AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>...	2004-06-23

It also brings to mind some of the best sports books ever. &quot;Ball Four's&quot; Jim Bouton played the game. &quot;North Dallas Forty's&quot; Peter Gent played the game.<BR>Having stood on the mound, facing down a hitter with the bases loaded, the crowd yelling, the opposition hurling insults, your future on the line and the hair standing up on the back of his neck, is an experience known by few. Jordan knows it. <BR>Here he writes about pitchers, his specialty. He writes about superstars like Tom Seaver, playboys like Bo Belinsky, hardthrowing drunks like Steve Dalkowski, 6-6 lefties who never lived up their potential, like Sam McDowell, and prep phenoms from his home state of Connecticut who met the same fate as the author.<BR>Jordan's talent is not one that can be learned in a literary class. He is of the school of hard knoocks, rough hewn, real, human. Bravo, Pat.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;	2004-06-17
