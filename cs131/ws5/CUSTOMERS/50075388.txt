As page 200 neared I looked in the index and saw that Pirates of the Carribean was discussed at page 399.  I skipped ahead and rest the rest of the book.  I will never go back and bore myself again with reports from Mike Eisner about Mike Eisner and how Mike Eisner is great.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book for anyone who wants to stay awake when they are reading.	2005-10-09

The Longest Night has no spies, just a guy nmaed Mouse, who is a Meyer Lansky employed hit man from Brooklyn, and who just happens to be Jewish.  We follow Mouse on a mission to Europe in which he is charged with helping to liberate a train-load of Dutch Jews who are headed for concentration camps.<br /><br />The writing is very good,especially the description of war-time Europe, and the story is well-told.  The only thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is that the pacing is slow to build up momentum, and this kind of book should be more tense.<br /><br />I will read Keizer's next book, and hope he delivers on the promise shown here.	2005-10-03

I didn't get it. This was interesting, but when I find myself skimming a book I can't bring myself to give it more than three starts.  Boring is boring, and this book is boring.  There is a good 400 page novel hiding here, but those extra 150 pages are doozies.<br /><br />Angels & Demons reads like a sort of 'testing ground' for Da Vinci, and while many of the parts that made Da Vinci a thrill ride are present in Angels, the parts don't work cohesively to give the same thrill. There is way too much detail given here about Vatican history and way too much time is spent dwelling on protagonist Robert Langdon's thought processes regarding artwork.  I found myself skimming pages at a time in order to get to the next important detail.  If I wanted an Art History lesson I would've taken a course in college about it!  Also, by the time the main villain was unveiled there wasn't much suspense as to the villain's identity.	2005-09-26

There's not much of a plot in this outing, and Zack is never in peril of any kind so the suspense is kind of thin.  Overall, this was one of the more amusing Zack books but also one of the least satisfying.<br /><br />I'm a 2nd grade teacher and have read this entire series, but won't be steering my class toward this one.  Most kids I work with aren't Elvis fans and won't get much of the humor.	2005-09-24

Zack visits a new dentist to have some of his teeth worked on, but as often happens to Zack the new dentist is more than he appears to be.  Zack starts going through a surprising transformation and he and his father must seek out some answers to get the situation resolved.  This book is one of the more suspenseful in the series, and was enjoyed by my 7-year old son and me.<br /><br />I will probably have some of the kids in my 2nd grade class read this book when National Dental Month rolls around.	2005-09-24

The contrast in their childhood upbringings and off-court relationships and training practices are covered well and thankfully not in laborious detail.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear more from Tracy Austin, Hana Mandlikova, and other players to help balance the Martina/Chrissie rememberances, but other than that, this book is very good.	2005-09-17

The characters are caricatures, however, and all seem to have come out of a character-factory.  The story zips along nicely, with plenty of action, but gets muddled due to an excessive amount of characters who have very little to do to the plot besides pad the pages.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not sure what audience Coville was trying to reach.  The dialogue and some of the situations seem designed for Grades 5-8, but the lack of details and amount of silliness seem intended for kids in grades 2-4.<br /><br />I wouldn't read this aloud to my 2nd grades, but might give it to a 4th grade teacher to share.	2005-09-17

The action scenes are top-notch, as are the dialogue and relationships.  The philosophical discussion and exploration of the neighboring dimensions became redundant after awhile and started to undermine my enjoyment of the text.  Luckily, I know how to skim the boring sections!<br /><br />I found the book to be engaging and enjoyable, and will read the next one in the trilogy to see where the story goes.  I hope this trilogy doesn't go the way of The Matrix trilogy, to which it has rightly been compared, and become progressively worse.<br /><br />I'll be keeping my fingers crossed.	2005-09-12

Readers who laugh at the headlines in the Enquirer and Weekly World News will get a kick out of the outlandish conspiracy buffs Jack meets at a convention.  But if you're a reader who enjoyed Jack's repair work from the first two novels you will most likely be disappointed, as  Wilson seems to have included a couple of incidents here mainly due to an editorial edict.<br /><br />This book ties Repairman Jack into the Adversary Cycle neatly, and connects the Rakoshi from 'The Tomb' and the broadcast power angle from 'Legacies' neatly together.  I would have given the book four stars, but found the ending to be extremely disappointing.<br /><br />I will continue to read the series, and hope the suspense gets turned up a notch in the next few books.	2005-09-06

For the last 6 years I've taught in a low-income, high crime area.  For the six years prior I taught in one of the wealthiest and safest CT districts.  This book offers ideas that can benefit all the students I've ever had, whether wealthy or poor.<br /><br />The overriding idea that Mr. Clark believes is that students must learn to be good people, not just good students. His book is about building character, and how good character can help lead to academic success.  If a classroom is filled with students who exhibit good character, than that room is a haven for students where students feel safe and unthreatened. They then don't have to worry about being criticized and picked on, and can instead put their energy into learning.<br /><br />Mr. Clark offers up ideas about how to get students to be good people.  He doesn't tell the audience how to teach or what academic subjects to focus on, he's interested in showing how important it is that character education be taught together with academics.<br /><br />Parents as well as teachers can benefit from this, but to benefit you might have to be willing to try something new.  Change can be good.	2005-09-01

The action, dialogue, and business scenes in the book are right on target, but the mystery aspect of the book falls short as do the scenes depicting the home lives of the central characters.  The mystery is fairly obvious and the home stories are riddled with cliches.<br /><br />This was highly enjoyable, but flawed.  If you read it you'll enjoy the ride.	2005-08-31

Lou Gehrigs's life reads like Roy Hobbs' life in \\"The Natural,\\" by Bernard Malamud (not the movie!).  Both men are gifted and decent players, whose lives and careers are cut short by disease.  I'm a long-time fan of both Gehrig and baseball, and was captivated by Eig's writing, and the details he put down about baseball back then, as well as Gehrig's life.<br /><br />Superb.	2005-08-28

There are lots of funny scenes in the story, and it was a lot of fun to picture which of my friends most resembled which of the guys who needed to go to Man Camp.  The premise, that men have forgotten how to be REAL MEN, is true to a degree, and was just believable enough to keep the book from being too ridiculous.<br /><br />In any case, at 212 pages the book is a perfect length for what it is.  My wife is now enjoying it, and will undoubtedly pass it on to some of her friends.<br /><br />This book makes a good companion for the movie \\"Hitch\\" and covers a lot of the same ground.	2005-08-23

The story centers around a terrorist attack in London and the reverberations that stem from that attack. The CIA and Mossad agents on display are all presented fairly, and add a measure of reality to England's response against the Jihad responsible, and the Saudi Arabian prince who's fronting the cash.<br /><br />A very strong book.	2005-08-18

Eve's long visits to \\"Ghost-World Pirateland\\" and \\"Serial Killer Hell\\" in her hunt to catch the villain do not move the plot along nearly enough to justify the almost 100 pages Armstrong devotes to them, and only serve to bog down the action.  Likewise, the final battle between Eve and the Nix, which also involves old favorites Lucas,  Savannah, and Jaime, the necromancer, takes way too long to come its conclusion, and features a plot device that was never hinted at.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but it's the first one by Armstrong that I will not be giving to any of my friends to read.  I'm hopeful that her next book, which will feature Elena and the werewolves, will regain the taut suspense that Armstrong's earlier books had.  Stephen King's best writing was done when his editors had the guts to edit him.  Let's hope Armstrong is amenable the next time an editor offers a suggestion.	2005-08-14

I'm a 2nd grade teacher who firmly believes that as long as a child is reading a book, then that book is a good book! I don't care if it's Captain Underpants, The Day My Butt Went Psycho, or Charlotte's Web.  The only way children are going to become good readers is by practicing reading. The best way to make a child a happy reader is to give that child a book he or she is happy to read.<br /><br />My son is going into second grade and is a relucant reader.  He knows how to read, is good at it, but just doesn't want to do it.  Jim Benton's Franny K. series is helping to change that. We just finished reading this entry, and my son was more than eager to help out with the reading so we could find out what happened next.  The words might be a little difficult for most beginning readers, but the pictures are great, the chapters are short, and lots of funny things happen.<br /><br />I'll be using the Franny K. series in my classroom this year, and firmly believe it'll help lots of reluctant readers become better readers.	2005-08-06

Ethan Black's newest Voort thriller moves along at a breakneck pace, putting our hero through one of the most harrowing experiences in literature, an experience more discomfiting than the dental torture scenes in Marathon Man, and equally as hard to read as the torture scenes in Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />Conrad Voort is broken down by the experience and must decide to succumb to the terror, or fight back.  The final 150 pages of this book are taut with suspense and action, and the interfamilial tension between Voorts, Voort and his partner, and Voort and Camilla add an emotional element that makes the suspense more real.<br /><br />This was an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.	2005-08-06

Once again, Rollins delivers exactly that.<br /><br />Sandstorm starts off like all great thrillers do, it introduces all of the main characters and then brings them together at the end of Act One.  In Act Two the characters band together to achieve their goal, but bad things happen, and the characters get separated.  Act Three has the characters merging together in an effort to beat the enemy and the the elements.  You know how it'll turn out, but it's so enjoyable you'll keep reading it anyway.<br /><br />The only thing keeping me from giving this book five stars is that Act Three goes on way too long.  The final fight is overlong and could have been condensed by fifty or so pages.<br /><br />On to his next book!	2005-08-05

Neither of them can do half the job Lashner does in bringing a courtroom drama to life. Victor Carl, the main character and narrator, is a one-of-a-kind lawyer, and for that we readers should rejoice.  Carl is a self-deprecating attorney who takes on cases and gets involved in situations that compel the reader to keep turning the pages.  The laughs generated by the story are genuine, the supporting characters well-drawn, and the courtroom scenes are  entertaining.  This story's villain is the most creative and entertaining character I've encountered in many years. This was a brilliant novel!<br /><br />Lashner, Sheldon Siegal, and David Ellis are writing some of the best legal thrillers out there, and if you haven't discovered any of these authors you have some great books ahead of you.	2005-07-28

Lawrence Block has written a gripping, moving, and suspenseful novel to mark the return of Scudder, Elaine, TJ, and other lesser characters.  This is the first of the Scudder books to be set in post-9/11 NYC, and Block is able to convey the characters' reactions to that event without belaboring it.  The mystery is excellent and the taut narrative keeps the story moving.<br /><br />It's been a pleasure to follow Matthew Scudder over the years, watching him age and interact with his cadre of supporting colleagues.  If Lawrence Block needs to take this much time between books in the series, I hope he continues to do so.  It was well-worth the wait.	2005-07-24

Serenity Falls has the trappings of classic horror tales like Salem's Lot, Wither, The Exorcist, and The Keep.  Like those other books Serenity Falls first sets up the everyday life of the community in which it takes place before starting to reveal the horrors that lurk behind seemingly normal doors.  I don't want to reveal any more about the story because I feel that horror is best left for the reader to discover at his or her own pace, and to give away details now would take away from your own enjoyment.<br /><br />The only place where this book fails (besides too many typos!) is that it is only the introduction to the story.  This book leads into the confrontations that will take place in the second installment, and I wish that the story had been published in one volume instead of being split into three.	2005-07-22

The first 450 pages were entertaining, and filled with lots of characterization and romance, but were sorely lacking in thrills and action.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />My 9-year old son devoured the first five books in the series earlier this year. He started to read this book and lost interest before finishing the first four chapters. \\"Dad, is there any fighting?\\" he asked.

It's a more mellow, peaceful, and lyrical affair that seems to come from another era, specifically the 1930s.  Carl Webster, the main character, is shown from the ages of 15-28, as we see his rise from farm boy to US Marshall.  His story is interweaved with real crime figures from the era, and some fictional characters as well.  The story meanders, taking its time to get from beginning to end, with a healthy dollop of history thrown in so we get the flavor of the era.<br /><br />There are none of the typical Leonard criminals who back-stab and cheat their crime partners, the humor is less frequent, and the violence is toned down.<br /><br />I found this to be a gentle, absorbing read, but don't think I'd want to read another with the same main character.	2005-07-16

My favorite story of them all is the one where he invents an invisible friend to help him get out of field day, but his mom turns the tables on him by treating the best friend even better than she treats Andy.<br /><br />I'm an elementary school teacher, and WOULDN'T READ this to my class due to some of the situations presented.  The most disturbing story was the one where Andy dressed up as a girl and went to a dance, where one of the boys tried to pick himi up.  However, I will read it to my children at home because I know there won't be any complaints. It's a perfect book to pick up when you have 10-15 minutes to spend reading because you can easily finish each short story within that time.	2005-07-13

The characters in this story are amusing, especially the Rusty Knight, and the talking frog.  Edward is a bland main character, but serves a purpose as the straight man around whom all the magic takes place.<br /><br />I will be using the book in my 2nd grade classroom this year, and feel that the short chapters and solid story will prove to be big hits with my students.<br /><br />The Moongobble series is an excellent introduction to the world of fantasy, and should prove to be a gateway novel for younger readers that will eventually lead them to the Secrets of Droon series, and from there to Harry Potter.	2005-07-13

We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives.  Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining.  I loved reading about this side of publishing...<br /><br />Then I hit the wall.  Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming.  The dialogue started disappearing.  The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.<br /><br />I gave up at page 130, regretfully.  I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't.	2005-07-09

The author's weird syntax and writing style - as if he was trying to reinvent grammar and punctuation rules - take a lot of getting used to, especially considering how ordinary the events in the book are.<br /><br />By the time I was used to the writing style, and didn't have to keep rereading sentences to see if they made sense, I was already past page 75.  Some readers might very well have given up on the story by then, and I don't know anybody who would blame them.<br /><br />This was Lupica's first foray into Harlan Coben territory. He has his pinky toe on the property line, but needs to work on getting his whole foot there.	2005-07-02

This book has them all, but not the way you might be hoping for.<br /><br />Want some supernatural creatures?  This book has them!  Vampires, witches, werewolves, fairies, pixies and ghouls abound throughtout the pages.  But except for the main witch, none of them really do anything to liven up the story.  The vampires are strong, but don't do anything supernatural.  The werewolves are simply paid assassins with no supernatural skills.  The characters are given supernatural titles, but the titles are no more than window-dressing.<br /><br />Want some sexual tension?  This book has it. It has so much sexual tension that the sexual tension stops being tense, and instead becomes boring.  This is especially annoying because the sexual tension never amounts to anything.  NO PAYOFF!<br /><br />Want an interesting mystery to solve?  This book ha...Never mind.  It doesn't have one.  We know from the start who the bad guys are, and the story never solves anything.  We're left in limbo at the end.<br /><br />I won't be buying anymore titles in this series. Thankfully, Kelley Armstrong is still writing.	2005-06-28

This time Drummond's been loaned out to the CIA (to get him out of the hair of his JAG commander), and he gets involved in a whirlwind race to save America from a team of daring and well-organized group of assassins.  The main action takes place in a 48-hour span, and we follow the increasingly punchy Drummond along as he attempts to help solve the problem by identifying the assassins.<br /><br />There wasn't a dull moment in the book, and I recommend it highly.	2005-06-26

This is the first of Silva's books featuring Gabriel Allon that I found myself skimming through to get to the good parts.  Once I got to the good parts I enjoyed the book immensely, but there were far too many parts that seemed to be there merely to educate us readers about the Israel/PLO conflict, and that didn't serve any purpose in terms of moving the plot along.<br /><br />Were I grading the book on how well it was written, I would have given Prince of Fire all five stars.  But I grade books on how entertaining they are, and I was not entertained.<br /><br />If I wanted a spy book in the Le Carre mold I'd want this book.<br /><br />But I don't like Le Carre, and found myself quite bored.	2005-06-24

The incredibly funny and moving story of how little nerdy Joey Margolis navigates his early teens in 1940's Brooklyn is told through a series of letters, notes, matchbook covers, and newspaper articles.  Joey's adventures and misdeeds bring him into contact with the Roosevelts, Mel Ott, Louis Armstrong, Humphrey Bogart, and many other celebrities, but the book mainly focuses on his relationship with fictional Giants' 3B Charlie Banks, and it is a relationship worth sharing with anyone you care about.<br /><br />This book touched me emotionally like few other books ever have, and it's going to be my Father's Day gift to my father this year.  I'm glad that I'll be able to share this with him, and look forward to sharing it with my own sons when they get a little older.	2005-06-09

I can't say the same for Sudden Death.  The red herrings are obvious, as are the suspected culprits.  This would have been okay if Mr. Rosenfelt had kept the book as tightly written as the others, but the narrative went on for too long as Carpenter repeatedly went through a litany of thoughts regarding the possiblility of his significant other moving away from him, and his fears of being killed by a noted drug dealer.  The humor that was so abundant in the other books in this series is also not as evident, and the text could have used more to compensate for the psychobabble.<br /><br />Enjoyable, but not as much as the others.	2005-05-31

The Tunnel, Otto's Boy, and 58 Minutes were exciting reads with good plots and page turning narrative.  This book falls far short of those other two with its wafer-thin characters and annoyingly condescending tone.  Also, for an action-thriller this book has a lot of space taken up by Wager's political opinions and societal observations of late 1960's America, which is when this book was written.<br /><br />I only recommend this book for die-hard Wager fans.  And, yes, that pun was intended.	2005-05-28

Moore is able to interweave Rapunzel, Rumpeltstiltskin, The Frog Prince, and a few other fairy tales into an entertaining laugh-out-loud narrative that's sure to have you smiling and wishing Moore would hurry up and get his third novel out already.<br /><br />I finished this book in less than a day (even hiding in my office so I could finish the last 20 pages without being disturbed), and heartily recommend that anyone in the mood for a Princess Bride type fix get a copy immediately.	2005-05-03

What is deniable is how interesting and involving it is.  The set-up is good and the first 150 pages moved along well as we are introduced to the cast of characters and their motivations.  The following 100 pages read like quicksand however, and the pace begins to move slower and slower.  By the time I got to page 270 I surrendered and refused to fight through the boredom that had captured me.<br /><br />If you like spy thrillers like Le Carre wrote grab this book.<br /><br />If you enjoy a Follett or Silva-paced thriller skip this.	2005-04-19

The story rockets along, propelled by tight narrative, short action pieces, sizzling dialogue, and chapters that are shorter than the hairs on Michael Jordan's head.  I found this book to be fun and involving, and though the two big twists at the end weren't surprising, the way the main character reacted to his own surprise made the segments believable.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who just want to escape for a while.	2005-04-19

Does he find any similarities where previous investigators have failed?  If you have to ask you've probably never read a thriller before.  A good read, but with an ending that could have been more detailed.<br /><br />This book is similar to 24 by Greg Iles, and other books due to the nature of the theme, so if you've enjoyed other books with parents searching for their seemingly gone-forever children chances are good that you'll enjoy this one as well.	2005-02-21

The suburban characters we meet are faced with less-than-perfect lives that aren't what they envisioned themselves having, and it would surprise me if there were readers unable to identify with one of the leads.  The deus ux machina of the novel comes from a newly paroled child-molester who moves into town, ratcheting up the suburbanites' fear factor and motivating them into making some questionable decisions.<br /><br />A fascinating read, and a book sure to generate conversation.	2005-02-21

Humor is a good tool to help move a book along.  Armstrong writes great dialogue in which different characters have distinctly different voices, and sarcasm and attitude roll off the paper.<br /><br />2) Keep the plot moving! Readers don't need to have our plots bogged down by long internal debates raging inside character's head.  Armstrong has a knack for giving us the information we need without putting us to sleep.<br /><br />3) Entertain us.  This book's twists and turns and sex are all well-done, and manage to keep the pages turning long after the clock strikes midnight.<br /><br />This book was lots of fun, and will be passed on to many of my friends.	2005-02-06

This lean, spare novel conveys the joy of 1940's baseball while bringing us back to how life was in war-time America, and the period shortly after the second World War.  Parker tells the tale of Robinson by focusing on a fictional bodyguard hired by Branch Rickey to protect Robinson.  The criminal elements of the novel combine with the social aspects of Robinson's groundbreaking season and make this book a compelling page-turner.<br /><br />It's a nice feeling to encounter a book that you wish would never end.  This book gave me that feeling.	2005-01-23

I wanted to read this book because I'm a Stephen King fan and enjoyed his article on the Little League World Series that appeared in The New Yorker magazine a few years back.<br /><br />The Stephen King sections of this baseball diary were terrific.  His sense of humor, emotions, and sense of pacing came through perfectly, and unlike some of his recent fiction he was able to keep his writing on-target.<br /><br />The Stewart O'Nan-penned pieces weren't a match for the King-scribed parts.  Mr. O'Nan's writing was clinical, and largely unemotional despite his insistence that he's a rabid Red Sox rooter.  He spends a lot of time detailing mundane details of gathering batting practice foul balls, autographs, and conversations with ushers. A lot of time. A REALLY lot of time.<br /><br />A diary is supposed to reveal a person's honest emotional state and opinions, and the woodenness of the O'Nan sections made me put this book down on two occasions and pick up another book to read.  Thankfully, the Stephen King sections increased in frequency once August rolled around, and I was able to weather (and skim) O'Nan's parts.<br /><br />Overall, the book was mediocre.	2005-01-22

The Wicked Witch's childhood and foray into college were engrossing to read about. The rest of the book became a thinly-veiled retelling of Hitler's rise to power in Germany and a lecture about how power corrupts and how evil it is to infringe upon the rights of others.  Unfortunately, the main character is largely devoid of personality, and Maguire doesn't have the ability to lure the reader into the fantasy of Oz.<br /><br />This book is a critic's darling, but I don't think it would win the People's Choice.	2004-12-08

All the elements that were present in his earlier books are present here, and in a much more advanced form.  The characterizations are sharp, the action fast and furious without being deadened by long-winded explanations of the weaponry, the story crystal-clear, and the science accurate and intriguing.<br /><br />While much of the story is similar to Excavation, Rollins has moved the action to the Amazon river basin in South America, and the natural wonders of the rain forest climate easily top the wonders of subterranean Earth.  The plants and animals talked about in this book are indigenous to the rain forest, and while we learn about the habitat the education comes as a result of a fast-paced taut tale.<br /><br />An excellent read, and one you shouldn't expect to be able to put down.	2004-11-28

Perhaps not on the first ballot, but definitely within the first few years of eligibility.<br /><br />This book made me feel as though I'd stepped through a time-warp and into the stands of the Polo Grounds 100 years ago.  The baseball scenes are told with an obvious fondness through the eyes of the narrator, whose life we learn about through his musings on his beloved Giants and the magnificent Christie Matthewson.<br /><br />Spanning almost twenty years of baseball action, from Matty's rookie season no-hitter through his death in the mid 1920's, we are given a glimpse of how life used to be for an avid baseball fan.  We are treated to encounters with John McGraw, Hal Chase, Smokey Joe Wood, Amos Rusie, and Christie Matthewson himself.  Near the end of the book there is an impressive amount of time given to the 1919 Black Sox, and the tainted World Series against the Reds.	2004-11-19

It provides insightful commentary along with per game statistics that let you know how even the most little-used bench warmer would perform if given a starting job in the NBA.  Last year's book predicted great things for Zach Randolph and Michael Redd, and this year's book is packed with great articles and helpful info.<br /><br />I wish I'd known about this book two years ago!	2004-11-19

Books	4	15	15	N	N	Gutman Hits it Well, but it Goes Foul	This is the third in Mr. Gutman's new series and it was by far my first-grade son's favorite of the three.  The narration by AJ, the reluctant school-goer, is engaging and the character of Mrs. Loopy is well-drawn and entertaining.  Throughout the book Mrs. Loopy makes attempts to liven up books for AJ in order to turn him into someone who doesn't hate books.  Judging by how well the author lured my son (a reluctant reader) into the book, Mrs. Loopy met her objective.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: I am an elementary school teacher and found three parts of the book objectionable.<br />1) Mrs. Loopy pulls up her shirt to show a tattoo to AJ and his classmates.<br />2) AJ and his classmates break into Mrs. Loopy's office instead of lining up with the rest of their class.<br />3) In the last chapter AJ grabs Mrs. Loopy's shirt and pulls it out in order to have visual access to her belly button.<br /><br />An enjoyable read, but be aware of those parts before you read.	2004-11-17

Of course, as in many of these books, there are grudges being held and old scores to settle.  The fun of this book is in watching the older spy run rings around his opponents, and also the way he influences a younger spy to come along to his way of thinking.  The book is highly entertaining and made for a good read.<br /><br />If I were Brian Garfield and I heard about this book, I might decide to see just how many similarities there are between Hopscotch and Whirlwind.  Can you say 'lawsuit?'	2004-11-11

Not only are the suspense, pacing, and characterizations written with verve, panache, and skill, Alten also manages to educate the reader about both prehistoric and modern marine life.

It's a tale of a bloated body of words that have nothing to do with moving the story along and makes the reader wish King had never started this literary journey, and it's a tale of streamlined prose that ratchets up the tension and makes us glad that we have journeyed with Mr. King all these years.<br /><br />Enough.<br /><br />This series started with four great books, declined with numbers 5, and was barely tolerable with Song of Susannah.  This final installment has elements of the first four books, but is bloated by many passages that have nothing to do with moving the story along.  I loved the early parts of the book that brought the Ka-tet together again, Brautigan's story,  and the Coda and Epilogues.<br /><br />What I mostly could have done without was every scene involving Roland's 'son.' If only Mr. King (or his no-good editor) had figured out that a well-placed shot from Susannah in the Dixie Pig would've saved the reader many pages of pointless text (and a few thousand trees' lives) this book would've rated much higher.<br /><br />After I put down \\"From a Buick 8\\" midway through, I'm wasn't sure I was going to continue filling my shelves with Mr. King's books.  And though my journey through this book was almost abandoned due to the relentless inanity of the story, I'm glad I stuck it out.<br /><br />Fare well, Roland.  Mr. King, please get an editor with some cajones!	2004-11-09

Too many James Patterson-like short chapters permeate this book, making it read like a screenplay instead of a novel.<br /><br />Entire chapters have seemingly been cut, leaving the reader to wonder why certain elements of the story were introduced in the first place.  The romantic angle between Jack Swyteck and his co-attorney, Sofia, is never explored though it is hinted at frequently.  The investigations done by supporting character Theo are, with one exception, totally glossed over.<br /><br />This was enjoyable, but it's not much more than a book-by-number.	2004-10-11

Get up, exercise, shower, get myself and the kids ready for work, go to work, get the kids......<br /><br />But somehow I finished this book in three days.  It had been sitting on my shelf for months, waiting for me to succumb to the bait, and when I finally did I was definitely hooked.  The story moves along briskly with well-drawn (almost like a comic book) characters, scenes of suspense, romance, humor, and mystery.  The only thing holding me back from giving the book 5 stars is that there wasn't enough mystery.  Too many key points were revealed early on, but I'll forgive the author and buy the next two in the series.	2004-10-09

I am happy to report that this book fit the bill!  I read the entire book to my son in less than one day, and the light-hearted text stimulated conversations about time, numbers, and dinosaur theories and habits.  While the story is simplistic, it is engaging as well, and leads into many future series possibilities.  If there are more, my son is already set to read them, and I'll be giving them out to children in my classroom as well.	2004-10-09

I'm male, and thoroughly enjoyed the story, much as I did with the book Wither, by John Passarella.  The supernatural aspects of the story are well-done, with believable (within the context!) updatings of the werewolf mystique, and a look into the social aspects of werewolf life.  The story is engaging, action-packed, and with plenty of humor provided by the protagonist, Elena.  I recommend this book highly, and look forward to reading Stolen.	2004-08-28

The text is lean and humorous, and the story twisted enough to keep you guessing a little bit, while not so twisted that the experienced mystery reader will have trouble finding the clues.<br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Rosenfelt for another engaging entry, and bravo for keeping the book under 300 pages.  Not every book needs to be lengthy, especially when it is as entertaining as this one.	2004-08-17

Simply told, with a bevy of narrators telling the story in different voices, Election (the book) was every bit as enjoyable as Election (the movie). Normally, books far exceed the cinematic versions that are made of them, but in this case the book and the movie are equally high-quality. If you liked the movie, you'll like the book.<br /><br />The only differences are the ending, and the progress of Tammy, and both the book's ending and Tammy's situation were much more believable in the text.<br /><br />I have just taken Perrota's other books out of the library (yes, Amazon, some of us still go there) and am eager to read them all.	2004-08-12

There are no serial killers here, and no cheap thrills.  We know who the guilty party is from early on, and the joy of the book is found in watching Davenport et al inch closer to the answers they seek.  Sandford's lean spare dialogue serves to move the story briskly along, much like one of McBain's beloved 87th precinct novels.<br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Sandford.  It's a pleasure to read a book that's not bloated by an author's diarhea of the word-processor.	2004-08-10

No Thrills Ahead...Enjoy Carefully	Unlike most of Grisham's earlier works, like The Firm and The Pelican Brief, this book does not revolve around a life-or-death search for the truth behind a major conspiracy.  This book is a slow, leisurely-paced tome that traces the history of a small-town in Mississippi as told through the eyes of the 'Yankee' who takes over the local weekly newspaper.<br />Yes, there is a murder, but there's no mystery.  The murderer is sentenced to jail, and when he's released new murders occur. Most experienced readers will already know who the guilty party is, so the joy of the book must be taken from the old-fashioned story-telling rather than from solving a mystery.<br />I enjoyed this book, but won't be recommending it to people who enjoy brainless thrillers.	2004-07-08

I read this book on vacation, enjoyed it, but was disappointed to discover that I'd correctly guessed the villain before the first third of the book was finished.<br />I enjoy Margolin's writing, but hope he starts taking his time so that he can come up with some more original plotting.  I'd hate to see his books go the way of Jonathan Kellerman's and Robin Cook's: two authors whose redundant story-lines moved them from my 'Must-Read' list to my 'Must-Avoid' list.	2004-07-08

I've been reading Block's books for 25 years, starting with The Thief Who Couldn't Sleep, and while I am an avowed fan of the author, am also able to admit that some of his offerings have been far from top-notch.<br />This book, however, is first-rate fun.  An entertaining and breezy mystery with quirky characters, superb burgling, and a size that's just right for the content.  Block is rarely guilty of over-writing, and like Elmore Leonard, writes great dialogue that moves the story along.<br />The story here is the weak element.  While the plot is joyful and interesting, the sheer number of coincidences that play such an important part in the story become a bit much after a while.  The conclusion of the book fails to bring all the salient elements together, and to his credit Block's protagonist admits as much.  I have a feeling Block wrote himself into a corner and sort of crapped out on the ending.<br />You know what?  I didn't care.  I loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.	2004-05-08

While every Finder book has been worth the wait, this one is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.<br />Wow!  I'm an avid reader of thrillers who lately has become bored by the genre.  Baldacci, Kellerman, the Ludlum ghost-writers, and many others have been boring the pants off me. But when I saw Finder's name on the cover of this book, a little charge went off inside my head.  No two books from this author have been alike in content, but they all share the same trait.  Readability with a twist.<br />I loved Paranoia and read it in two days. Considering that I have a full-time job,  help out a lot with my children and household chores, and was whacked by another driver today...that says something about how much this book entered into my psyche.<br />A page-turner with humor, suspense, romance, action, and surprises.

I've been in the mood for a courtroom thriller, but most of the recent books I'd picked up in the genre all looked hell-bent on boring me to pieces with overlong plots full of convoluted and contrived plotting narrated by a stoic, boring, and morally upstanding protagonist.<br />Not this one!  Arch Gold is a bit underdeveloped as the main character, but since Gold is narrating, who cares?  The story zips along from chapter-to-chapter, and no space is wasted on boring filler material.  If James Patterson were still writing good books, and tried his hand at a legal thriller, this might be the book he'd come up with. The story was interesting, the humor frequent, and my satisfaction complete.	2004-01-26

This book stinks!  The writing is juvenile, the ideas insipid, and the style awful. The best thing I can say about the book is that it's short.  It didn't take me long to flip through the pages (most of them have lots of empty space on them) and reach the end. The arguments are short because Russo has no facts to back them up, only opinions.  Russo's opinions stand alone about as well as a flamingo in a hurricane.<br />This is the perfect gift for a sports-nut who doesn't read, or for people who need kindling for their fireplace.	2004-01-18

This book is a radical departure for Mills, and though I approached it tentatively my fears proved unfounded, as the book quickly grabbed my attention, and the narrative sped along.<br />This book is reminiscent of Christopher Lehman Haupt's book, Thank You for Smoking, but is told at a much more breakneck pace.  It has the intelligence of some of Donald Westlake's more scathing books, and a healthy dose of humor and irony help propel it along.<br />I do admit that the characterizations are weak, but the characters are here as a deus ex machina, and aren't the important part of the story.  The important part of the story is the examination of the conflict in our government between the desire to get tax-money from tobacco firms, and the government's desire to protect people from the dangers of smoking.  Mills clearly thinks that anyone still smoking has brought upon their addiction to themselves, especially younger smokers who've been brought up in an enviroment where they're taught about the hazards of lighting up as soon as they enter school.<br />I recommend this book without hesitation, but only if you want to be entertained whlie being educated.  If you want a 'critic'-acclaimed level book, this one does miss the mark.	2004-01-13

The early chapters set the tone well, reacquainting us with some previously important characters, and introducing us to some new ones whose roles will grow and help move the story along.  The writing is excellent, and the plot superb, and the book is well worth the few hours of missed sleep it caused by not letting my eyelids close.	2003-09-25

Normally. Although all the elements usually found in the Plum series are in this book, they don't seem to emerge naturally.  The humor, plot, and situations that are present seem to be randomly thrown together, and the result is a book that's okay to pass the time with, but not one that makes me recommend this to others.  The addition of Stephanie's sister to the characters adds nothing to the story, and merely serves to add another crazy character to a series rich with crazy characters.  The real proof to me that this book is not up-to-par with Evanovich's other offerings is that my  mother-in-law didn't read past chapter 3, and normally she finishes off one of these novels like Lula can finish off a Big Mac.	2001-11-30

The author then keeps the action,  and character development, moving as Beamon is drawn once-again into the  political arena.  The book is especially timely considering that we are in  an election year, and have to consider who we'll vote for and why.  The  pacing is superb, the dialogue and action crisp, and if you liked the  opening scene from M-I:2, then you'll love the rock climbing parts of this  book.
