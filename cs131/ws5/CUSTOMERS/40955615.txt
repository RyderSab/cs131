But while the way in which the letters are introduced, they are grouped by pencil stroke, which, while better than introducing in alphabetical order, means that the lower-case and capitla letters aren't introduced together. I suggest using the order suggested by the \\"Between the Lions\\" educational consultant: m s t p f n a o d k l u b g r i z c h w y qu x e (lower case before upper case.) Whatever you do, do not use the \\"Obvious Letters\\" CD; it is educationally unsound.	2005-09-23

But as a certified preschool teacher in a state Board of Education accredited center I am surprised at the positive reviews for this product. Parents should not use this with their children at home, and day care teachers should not be using it with their class, at the risk of setting things down in a way that will put those children at a disadvantage in public school reading instruction. The words for the objects used for the letters are in ALL CAPITALS, and that is not how we are to model words. While it is debatable whether or not it is acceptable to teach preschoolers to print their name with all capital letters at first (I do, but transition them into using the initial capital and the rest lower case), the research shows that early learners need to be in a \\"print rich\\" environment, and the words around them need to be printed in lower case except for proper nouns. There are other, albeit less important, flaws in this CD-ROM electronic book, but it should be enough to note that while this presentation is \\"cute,\\" it is certainly educationally unsound. It would be far better to get and use \\"Look, Write, & Remember Letter Formation Practice Pages\\" by Susan Brindise from the Scholastic publishing house.	2005-09-22

The Constitution of the United States of America specifically states in a number of places that no state or citizen can form another nation without the consent of the Congress, if at all. By concluding that Southern secession was Constitutional, the author loses credibilty. There are other ways to \\"justify\\" the secession that led to the Civil War, but the Constitution is not one of them.	2005-08-10

I couldn't believe the words in the &quot;editorial review&quot; above! As A politically conservative Christian I say this book is NOT an unbiased examination of the similarities and differences in the Holy Bible and the Qur'an. First, there is a photo of Usama bin Laden on the cover; how does that shade the views about Islam in this book? Second, Muhammed is branded a terrorist instead of as a warrior; there is a difference between war and terrorism! Third, the book uses the old word &quot;Koran&quot; instead of the newer, more respectful &quot;Qur'an.&quot; This book looks to be only for Fundamentalist &quot;Christians&quot; who want justification to believe untruths and half-truths about Islam. A better book, if you would read it with an open mind is &quot;Islam Denounces Terrorism&quot; <BR>by Harun Yahya. That book shows you thjat what is goig on in the world with terrorists who claim to be following Islam is based on politics, not on faith in Allah and adherance to the Qur'an.	2003-10-13

Older children can read the culturally sensitive text and all children love the colorful, interesting pictures. <BR>My only problem with the book is the naked, rear view of Adam and Eve in the beginning.

Despite some five-star reviews, I do not think this book is good for reading.<br />While this book does have a method which could help children to read, the philosophy for it is flawed. There is much misinformation. The book talks about the &quot;failure&quot; of Phonics and Whole Language in teaching schoolchildren how to read. That is just plain wrong. <br />Phonics ONLY instruction produced children who could read but not understand what they read. But phonics must be a part of effective instruction in reading. Part, not all. <br />Whole Language instruction did produce excellent when it was used properly; with all of the components used according to the model. But many times a &quot;whole language&quot; program did not fully follow the model and so children could not read well.<br />Whole Language died a political death but an effective systems, a &quot;Comprehensive Literacy Program,&quot;  does work. If your school system uses it you'd be better asking your child's teacher for things to do at home to help your child rather than buying this book.	2003-08-28

This is a classic book for young readers and I had thought it would be accurate on the level of the readers. I looked back at a copy with a publishing date of 1985 and I was shocked when I saw the apatasaurus called the old, incorrect name of \\"brontosaurus.\\" But that was not the worst error! Many older books have the name wrong 9and thus the wrong head, but that can be a minor thing.<BR>But it got worse when it showed the \\"brontosaurus\\" as having nostrils on top of its head, which is actually a feature of the Brachiasaurus. And then having it hid from the Allosaurus (correct predator, at least) under water perpetuates the swamp-dwelling, water-immersing behavior model which is again incorrect. <BR>If only those offending pages could be excised it would get four or five stars. The book does show the flying and swimming contemporaries of the dinosaurs; correctly identifying them as not being \\"dinosaurs.\\" That could be more explicit but the point is made, even if subtly.<br />Now I see above there is a new publishing date. I hope the offending passage has been corrected. Then it would be a solid four-star book.	2003-05-01

Nothing could be further from the true. That concept perpetuates feelings of racial inferiority among African-Americans.<br />In reality, as every artist and many others know, every color has a positive and a negative quality. <br />Black is sometimes used negatively but consider that black is the formal color, black is the upperclass color, and many other good associations.<br />To be fair, the book is trying to help the situation.

When I saw her interview on a news magazine show she was describing Impressionism! Certainly not all of the Impressionist were murderers!<br />A second is her idea that using prostitutes as models somehow made him a prime suspect. Again, in the times, artists often used prostitutes as models as many &quot;respctable&quot; women would not shed their clothes for an artist. Also, Degas, for one, thought they were more &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; than professional models.

This book is taseful but focuses on the body area and would give you good knowledge and ideas. Get this book!	2001-11-07

If you read this you can become better educatedd on what gear you really need and how to use it properly (safely).<BR>Includes one particular gem: Do NOT get eye surgery if you plan on real mountaineering. You can have severe vision problems at altitude. This led to Beck Wethers terrible Everest injuries.	2001-11-05

There are at least a half-dozen better books for begiiner and intermediate pastelists. It is not bad, just not exceptional, either.	2001-11-05

Much more specific to rock climbing than &quot;the bible&quot;, &quot;Mountaineering: the Freedom of the Hills&quot;. <br />If you and a partner go through the exercises you will be better skilled than most of the climbers on the rocks.<br />Covers basic skills,  and has great sections on setting up Toprope anchors and placing protection on Lead. <br />ONLY problem is the casual use of girth-hitched slings. Girth hitching seriously reduces rope strength.	2001-11-05

Photos are not as good as a live model but this book is better than others. <BR>The only problem is it should be in color since the color changes on the skin in the light are really needed for good painting and drawing.	2001-10-29

If you try to learn the techniques on your own with this book you will be frustrated. This is the reference for after you take such a course. <BR>While it is shows many scenarios, it can be confusing with so many variations. They should have concentrated on the principles so the climbers could think their way out of a specific situation using the basic scenarios.	2001-10-29

There are a number of knot books, and this is the best! The illustrations are the best and in a brief volume rope care is also addressed. While I like most of the books in the &quot;How to (Rock) Climb&quot; series, their knot book illustrations are not as clear as this one.	2001-10-24

This book gives the principles of making anchors then shows examples of actual anchors and critiques each. Very helpful.<BR>The problem is the author, like many traditional climbers and guides, prefer to use the climbing rope as part of the anchor. This complicates things in a rescue situation. Slings and coralettes should be used for the belay anchors. Keep that in mind and this book will be very helpful for you in &quot;real&quot; climbing.	2001-10-24

But if you are just going to do top-roped cliff climbs it is way too much. Some books are actually better for rock climbing than this book's rock climbing sections.	2001-10-24
