The book is a state-by-state (with some Canadian listings also) description of prairie preserves accessible to the public.  Two or three preserves in each state are given fairly detailed descriptions (half a dozen pages or less) and several more preserves in each state are given a couple of paragraphs each.  Each preserve description contains information on the outstanding features of that place; sometimes these are geological, but more often plants or especially animal.  Some minimal climate data is included, and an important paragraph on when are the best times to visit. <br /> <br />Much of this information is available in fragmentary form over the internet, but it is worthwhile to have this consolidated complete in one place, and in a form you can take on a road trip.  A good guide to seeing this ecosystem (which is highly endangered and doesn't get nearly enough attention, though not a \\"great\\" book.	2005-04-10

E.O. Wilson is a shining example.  Unfortunately, Dr. Gotwald doesn't live up to Wilson's standard. <br /> <br />This book is written for other scientists.  It never gives a clear view of the big picture for any of the numerous species of Army Ants discussed.  Instead, it covers topics like \\"behavior\\" or \\"parasites\\" for all the numerous species of ants discussed.  Ants are always referred to by their scientific names, and I found myself befuddled trying to keep track of which genus of ants was which, or even which genus lived where.  Nowhere in the book is there a clear picture of \\"Species A behaves like this, it lives here, it makes a living by doing X, it's most common food items are Z, it is most commonly predated or parasitized by \\"B, D, and D, and the routine cycle of their existence is ______\\". <br /> <br />As an example, early on in the book, I learned that a great many army ants make their living by traveling and living underground, and preying primarily on other ant species' larva.  This was mentioned very early in the book, yet after completing the book, I'm not sure which ants these are, where they live, or (most importantly) how do they find and attack other ant nests.  The closest thing to a description of this activity described another ant species attacking a termite nest. <br /> <br />I'd rate it a \\"2\\", except that there just isn't any competition for a modern adult book on these ants.  You will learn a lot from the book, you'll just have (if your experience is like mine) a tough time putting the pieces together.	2004-12-27

Basically this is a rather thin book of drawings.  Plan views of buildings, vehicles, pieces of equipment, signage, and whatever else the author could find.  There's very little commentary or text, and there are some problems with what is there.  For instance the author describes the large round doors in Number Six's home as being \\"Rover-friendly\\" but doesn't explain how Rover would enter through the narrow front door!  He also gives credence to the story that the Prisoner is the John Drake character from an earlier series, even though McGoohan denies it. <br /> <br />I was a little surprised at the limited coverage of clothing.  It may be that there just isn't enough information out there, but extremely detailed drawings, and perhaps even patterns would be useful for the truly fanatical folks who want to create their own Village-style clothing! <br /> <br />About the only thing in this that made me say \\"Ah, that's interesting!\\" was a diagram of the layout of all the different nameplates in front of the masked audience in the Fallout episode.  It isn't really useful or vital, but I was curious at all the different groups listed--Anarchists, Old Folks, etc. <br /> <br />I can't recommend it for the money.	2004-09-17
US	52990752	R39J9W8DORNZJL	186108238X	617144280	Close-Up on Insects: A Photographer's Guide	Books	3	3	3	N	Y	Good book, but not remarkable	This book does well at covering the basics of insect photography.  The author begins by giving a broad review of general photographic principles.  Almost all of this is better-covered in general photography books, and it doesn't add much.  About the only thing unusual in this section is the author's encouragement that medium format cameras are the best choice for insect macro photography.  He gives some good arguments for this, and adequately covers most of the reasons NOT to use medium format, except that he completely omits any mention of the problems with depth of field inherent in medium format.<br />The author definitely is an entomologist, and appears extremely knowledgeable about insects and behavior.  We benefit from his expertise because most of the last half of the book is chapters on several common insect groups, with advice on photographing each type.  This is by far the best part of the book--This part rates four stars.<br />The book concludes with a very brief section on organizing your photo files, and marketing your work.  Nothing special here.<br />As is typical in nature photography books, each page is heavily illustrated with photos from the atuhor's files.  Many of the photos are gorgeous.  The author is from Europe, and most of his subjects are naturally European species.<br />The book does well on discussing technique in terms of approaching insects, and where to look for some common types of insect.  It doesn't do a very good job of discussing a number of techniques special to macro photography.  For instance, the author does mention use of reflectors for lighting in at least one place, but other than saying it can be handy, he gives no specific advice.  He repeatedly talks about using water tanks to shoot aquatic species under controlled conditions, but never gives any specific advice.  The book was published in 2002, and is good in acknowledging some recent technical developments and products among film cameras, but I don't recall even a brief allusion to digital--This isn't really a flaw, but it is peculiar.<br />Not a bad book, and the sections on specific insect types make this a useful purchase for the dedicated insect photographer.  But I think Larry West's book on insect photography is better.  I also thought Ronan Loaec's general macro photography book was a better buy.	2004-05-19

He applies this explanation to two actual examples where knowledgeable and trained people did stupid, self-destructive things that are in direct opposition to their knowledge and training.  That in itself was probably worth buying the book for.  The author claims that the majority of people, when confronted with a highly stressful situation, don't react appropriately.  This doesn't mean that they will fail to come through the situation, they may survive through luck, and they may have the opportunity to regain their composure and function properly before anything fatal happens.<br />In the succeeding chapters, the book gives detailed description of actual emergencies, and describes how those involved reacted.  Each chapter focuses on a particular type of behavior that is typical of survivor types.  This is the bulk of the book, and it is not as instructive as the first two chapters, though it is very interesting reading.<br />The epilogue summarizes key things the author believes mark those who are survivors from those who are not survivors.  The behaviors won't come as a big surprise to most people.  <br />One thing that disturbs me about the book is that the author almost harps on how much more important these behaviors are than actual skills.  I don't think the author believes that skill is unimportant--In particular two of his accounts of survival at sea show that skill is quite important--But I'm concerned some readers will decide that acquiring basic skills isn't urgent.  Which would be the wrong lesson to take from this book.  The book does acknowledge that training is important, but doesn't really do so until the epilogue I spoke of, where he urges those who will go into the wilderness to \\"take every training course you can find\\".  But that's a little late to start emphasizing that point!  Throughout the book, the author refers back to his father's frightful experience during World War II, which started his interest in what marks a survivor.<br />Those who want to supplement this book would benefit from Leach's \\"Survival Psychology\\", which discusses some of the same ideas and applies them to less outdoorsy situations such as hostage scenarios.	2003-11-23
US	52990752	R8QVDP83MFHLB	1590130022	83534825	Devil to Pay (The Richard Delancey Novels) (Volume 2)	Books	3	7	7	N	Y	Readable, very different from Hornblower	This book deals with Lieutenant Richard Delancey's efforts to find a purpose and direction in his career after stagnating for several years. It is the second in a series, I didn't read the first one, but didn't feel like I'd lost much by skipping it.<BR> For the first two-thirds of the book, the &quot;purpose and direction&quot; plot dominated (at least for me) the naval elements of the story.  In fact, very little of the book covers dashing nautical adventure of the type C.S. Forester might have written--Most of it takes place on shore, and the ships seem to be just platforms and vehicles, rather than central elements.  Naval battles barely intrude into the story at all.<br />As another reviewer commented, the last third of the book deals with a spy mission similar to the unfinished Hornblower novel.  In effect, the book is four different &quot;episodes&quot; strung together.  It is adequately good reading, but not brilliant.  The most interesting part for me was watching Delancey grow in ability, find a purpose, and gain confidence in himself as an officer and a leader.<br />Not a brilliant book, but good enough to make me seek out others in the series (this is the first one I read).  I'd give it three-and-a-half stars, if I could.	2003-09-14
US	52990752	R26KEWDAJ0KYGT	039331619X	210743552	Why the Allies Won	Books	3	11	18	N	N	Readable, but no clear purpose, and minor factual goofs	This book goes into a fair amount of detail about events that were important for the allies winning World War II--Enough that it reads like a historical overview in those areas.  But it makes little or no mention of other events.  The result is a book that is too broad for a detailed study of particular events or ideas, but not complete enough to satisfy someone wanting a one-book introduction to the war.  It also leaves the reader with an exaggerated idea of the potential for Axis victory in the war, at least in my opinion.<br />The book is basically a collection of essays on different topics that stand alone.  There is no unifying theme, except victory in World War II.  Nor does the author give a single &quot;pat&quot; answer to the question implied in the title.  He simply describes a number of things that the Allies did well, or the Axis (mostly the Germans) did badly that lead to the war turning out the way it did.  And his points are all, or at least nearly all valid, even though they aren't comprehensive (he leaves out some important things, in my view).  One of these points is actually a pretty good one.  He does a better job than any other author I know of in demolishing the myth of German high technology and wonder weapons.  He feels (justifiably, I think) that these projects actually detracted from the German war effort.<br />The book has some good points--Many of the essays are decent, and the author seems to have scoured original source diaries and memoirs for relevant quotes that illustrate some of his ideas.<br />The book is heavily tilted towards the European theater.  There is some discussion of the naval war in the Pacific, a very brief discussion of the final bomber offensive against Japan (including the atomic bombings), and a short discussion of the deficiencies of Japanese ground forces.  Otherwise, the Pacific War is mentioned in passing if at all.  The US submarine war against Japan was very important in the defeat of Japan, but is mentionedonly in passing.  US amphibious invasion tactics and technology as used in the Pacific are not covered.<br />There are some factual howlers in the book.  To pick two from my area of expertise, the pretty good discussion of how the US and Britain developed their ideas on strategic bombing doesn't even mention the disastrous British daytime bomber raids in December 1939, which turned the RAF brass against unescorted daytime bombing.  A less important one is an incorrect date for the first US air attacks on German forces--The author gives the date of the first raid by bombers entirely crewed by US airmen, but identifies it as the first US bomber attacks, which simply isn't true.  I mention that, because it makes me wonder about whether the book has other slipshod facts in it that I don't recogize.<br />Not an awful book, but overall it is too general for the specialist who is well-read on World War II, and has too many problems and gaps for an introductory book.  I'd skip it.	2003-08-31

A few are complete essays, but most are excerpts from longer works.  At least one is a one-panel Gary Larson cartoon!<br />Most of the selections are entertaining, or at least interesting.  Many are records of direct observation by naturalists in the 19th or early 20th Centuries.  Usually they have some distinguishing feature such as freakish behavior, first observation, or an exceptionally interesting experiment included.<br />This is not a scientific book on insects--Although many of the authors are scientists, the excerpts don't fit together to make a textbook or organized survey of insects.  What it is is very interesting and entertaining--A good bathroom or bedside book for the insect-lover.  Definitely do not choose it as your first or only book in trying to learn about insects, but it makes a good addition to the insect library of an enthusiast.	2003-08-04

The author had great access to official records of the submarine war. The book has the strengths and weaknesses you'd expect from that sort of sponsorship. First, it is very thorough, and within constraints, very authentic. The author and editors had direct access to the people who'd run submarines against the Japanese. And this is very complete (within constraints, again). Maps, illustrations, and informative tables are included. But there are those constraints I mentioned. This is the &#34;party line&#34; Navy history of the war. Everyone is a loyal sailor, tried and true, selflessly doing his job for Mom and apple pie. There's little hint of personnel problems, such as the near-mutiny of the officers of the BATFISH (mutiny is perhaps too harsh, see the August 2016 comments below), or the political problems which lead to flaws in US torpedos, and made it more difficult to identify and fix the problems. Because of wartime secrecy requirements, there's also little or no mention of US efforts to decode Japanese naval traffic. The USS Nautilus is given credit for sinking the carrier Soryu at the Battle of Midway, when it is pretty clear that the submarine contributed little or nothing to the sinking. Despite my grousing, the book is readable, detailed, and invaluable for understanding the US submarine war. I just recommend that it be supplemented with less biased and more modern books...Clay Blair's SILENT VICTORY would be a good start.	2003-08-03

Large, well-reproduced photos of important or interesting naval items.  Most are dynamic and excellent shots, though a few have depth-of-field problems--Lengthy objects sometimes have the close or far end slightly out of focus.<br />The accompanying text for each item is brief, basically a lengthy caption.  In some cases, I wanted more detail.  Some of the petty details that are included are very interesting, though.  My favorite was the reaction of dockworkers in England to the Navy effort to build ships of long-lasting teak in the Far East.  When their jobs were threatened by foreign competition, the English shipwrights began spreading rumors of how teak splinters were poisonous!<br />The selection of subjects is EXCELLENT, with almost all of them in wonderful shape.  The collections of a number of museums were used, as well as the ship HMS VICTORY at Portsmouth.  Oddly, I don't remember any items from the outstanding naval museum at Portsmouth, however.<br />Highly recommended for the illustrations, though if you really want to know details of how items of rigging and such were used, you will want to supplement this book with another that has better text (and probably has greatly inferior illustrations). The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea would be a good choice.	2003-07-30
US	52990752	RXNXTI0NV09P9	0674454898	470389774	Insects through the Seasons	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Readable, worthwhile	This is one of several books by Dr. Waldbauer I've read. I thoroughly enjoy his books. The book is divided into chapters that follow insect activities through a year. Each chapter covers a type of activity that is appropriate for the time of year, such as breeding, getting enough to eat, hiding out, keeping warm (these are my paraphrases, not actual chapter titles).  The book covers a variety of different species. It's extremely readable. Only disadvantages I can see are that it is not organized well for reference, and it may not offer as much depth as you want if you are particularly intrigued with one of the dozens of subjects he discusses. You'll have to go to other sources for an all-in-one-place focus on one species. On the other hand, the book makes no pretense of being a comprehensive reference work--It is a readable overview, and never pretends to be anything else. So if that's what you are looking for, this book will serve very well.    Recommended for anyone with a non-academic interest in the subject.	2003-02-22

The equipment advice given is hopelessly obsolete.  None of this is the book's fault, of course.  Most of the techniques described are similarly old-fashioned, but they are still fundamentally sound in most cases.<br />Unless an old-fashioned book of this type really interests you, I'd pass on the book.  Nothing wrong with the book, just that this day is past.  John Shaw's book on closeup photography may be a better choice, though it is (unlike this book) specialized towards nature photography.	2003-02-18

It does give you sufficient information on them to help understand what you see when you view them in the field.  And it helps you identify the most common ones in the USA and Canada.<br />A few pages in the front of the book give brief background information on dragonflies, and on equipment and strategies for observing them in the field.  Then you go to page after page of species descriptions.  Important identification information is given for each species, and at least one (sometimes more when appropriate) photo.  The photos are usually of good quality both as photos and as identification aids.<br />A key in the inside cover of the book helps you pick out characteristics of a dragonfly you are observing, and the key then points you to the appropriate pages in the book using a color tab system.<br />I compared copies in hand of this book, and its chief competitor, DRAGONFLIES THROUGH BINOCULARS.  I felt this book would be more useful in the field, so I ordered this one from Amazon.com, not the binoculars book.  That's the best testimony I can give.  I've since read and begun to use the book, and I am happy with my choice.<br />Only downside to this book is that it may tempt you to order one of the larger, more in-depth books on dragonflies, which are quite expensive!	2003-02-18

The strength of the book is that it is Osa's first-person narrative. This is someone who was really there.  And the Johnsons do some amazing things together.  The book keeps moving at a fast pace, the adventures keep coming, and I didn't want it to end.  <BR>The book is a window into a very different era.  The Johnsons were products of their time, and some of their viewpoints will bother a few readers.  They were not bigots, and in fact appear to me to be rather enlightened for the time, but some of her descriptions of native peoples seem slightly condescending.  I may be reading something that isn't there.  Some of their practices while exploring  and photographing new places would now be totally unacceptable--Stirring up inoffensive animals to get some action for the cameras, or casually introducing an alien plant (watercress) into Africa.  Again, these are products of the views of that day, rather than something to condemn.<br />The book does have some weaknesses:  The biggest one is that this is (effectively) &quot;The Authorized Biography&quot;.  Many problems and difficulties are glossed over.  I read in the modern Introduction that Martin continually struggled with health problems during his adventures, but there is no hint of that in the text.  Because the book covers so much ground, in many cases the description of their adventures is scanty, and I wanted more detail.  And I suspect there's more to the story in some cases. So I am going to find some other books on the Johnsons and try to learn more about them.<br />Perhaps that's the strongest thing to say about the book--That it left me wanting to know more, and inspired to find it out!  I'm also going to visit the museum in Kansas dedicated to their work.	2003-01-23

Rather than spending time discussing how to use photographs to make your submissions more appealing, or how to market books or articles that include both writing and photographs, this book is a very basic introduction to principles of photography.  There are many, many superior books on this subject.<br />To make matters worse, this book is very dated.  There is significant space spent on setting up a black-and-white darkroom, and the author sings the praises of manual focus camera systems which haven't been manufactured for a decade.  The book is copyrighted 1998, so there is no excuse for this.  A writer who knows little of photoraphy is literally much better off without the book than with the dated information it contains.<br />I cannot recommend the book for any purpose.  I haven't checked back to verify, but I believe this is my first one-star rating out of my many Amazon reviews (I've given very few two-star ratings, also).  I can give it with a clear conscience.	2003-01-12

Robert Asprin would crank out another book in this series every year or two. The books were lighthearted, and not great literature, but they were immensely entertaining. Asprin produced several of these, but the early '90s, the long run came to an end. \\"Real-life\\" crises for Asprin, combined with quarrels with the publishing house were rumored to be responsible.<BR>Now MYTH is back. In the foreword, Asprin tells us he tried to pick up the story where he'd left off, but that it was just too much--The numerous characters and plot twists were too complex to just jump back into after all this time.<BR>So Asprin tried to ease back into things, writing a story set earlier in the series, in between two of the earlier books. He limited himself to just three of the numerous characters.<BR>Reading the book, you can tell Robert is out of his groove. It doesn't sing like the others. Even though the book is shorter than earlier stories in the series, I still found myself waiting for it to be over. It isn't atrocious, but it ain't great. Like an earlier reviewer, I do prefer Phil Foglio's illustrations to the ones used here, but that's a minor point.<BR>Despite this, I urge you to buy the book! Only if sales on this one (and the recently released SOMETHING'S MYTH-ING) are good will there be more of these books, and even though this one is a bit of a rough re-start to the series, I am confident Asprin can get his old groove back and resume writing winners.<BR>The base rating for this one is three stars, but I am so pleased to see the series back in production, I'm giving it a bonus star!	2002-10-28

The book captures one particular activity--Rutting, and describes how several different species act it out.  The social and breeding habits of several different species, including deer (white-tailed and mule), elk, moose, bison, and caribou, are described.  Covering several species in one book gives the reader a good opportunity to compare the habits of each type.  The author writes with a wry sense of humor--I'm not the only one who felt this way, I overheard a park ranger and volunteer discussing it in one of the visitor's centers at Rocky Mountain National Park!<BR>There are some downsides to the book--It is not a terribly thick book, and much of the space inside is taken up with excellent photographs.  The pages are large enough to display the photos in an attractive way so they can be appreciated.  Unfortunately, this means there is not as much room for text as in most books.  Despite this, I never felt like coverage of any species was slighted.  Choosing a narrow topic probably helped.  The book isn't cheap, but I felt considerable satisfaction from reading it.  Recommended.	2002-10-28

Think about \\"The Guns of August\\" and you have the idea. The book describes how selfishness, ineptitude, overconfidence, and betrayal make this happen.  I love the series, and I enjoyed this book, but it is weaker than most of the predecessors.  Some may be disappointed that the great majority of the book deals with politics and diplomacy rather than space battles.<BR>Honor Harrington is certainly part of the book, but the recent series trend of spending more and more time focusing on other characters is continued here.  Overall, the basic plot is okay, though the main betrayal in the book strikes me as a scam more suited to high school student government, rather than the State Department of a sophisticated interstellar government.<BR>I agree with two comments of other reviewers--The book is longer than it needs to be.  A couple of times while reading it, I actually found myself looking at how much I had to go in the book, and thinking \\"When will we get to the really good stuff?\\" Much of it is genuinely interesting, but we spend too long just watching the slide towards war. I also strongly agree with the reviewer who said that the book reminded him of the middle volume of a trilogy.  That's a perfect description!  A slightly heavier editorial hand might have improved things by trimming some of the scenes out of the book.<BR>The book covers a lot of changes in Honor's universe, and if you are a fan of the series, it is a must-buy.  I'm confident Weber can pick up the tempo in future books, and you'll be lost if you miss this one.  But you might consider waiting for the paperback and saving a few bucks.	2002-10-23

Not much biology.	The book recounts many of the sightings of the sea serpent, almost to the point of being boring. I wasn't aware of this \\"serpent\\" as an ongoing phenomenom in early American history till reading the book, but now I see that these sightings influenced our expectations and assumptions about sea mysteries in a big way.<BR>The sightings do tend towards repetition after awhile. Some of the personalities who became involved in the legend are interesting. I'd have enjoyed more \\"biology\\" or at least biological speculation, but that's limited to a chapter at the end of the book. Worthwhile for those with an interest in cryptozoology, others should probably skip it.	2002-08-28
US	52990752	R1FV7SBNWXPAN8	1885061331	94438536	Birds of Oklahoma Field Guide	Books	5	52	52	N	N	Specialized, but excellent!	Perhaps the greatest strength of this book is that it is extremely specialized--It is prepared with the goal of helping you identify in the field birds frequently spotted in Oklahoma. The book has a two-page spread on each species, the left side is a photo of the bird (possibly with insets of different morphs, juveniles, or the opposite sex), and the right side is a page packed with information. Each species has short descriptions of key facts about the species. If the male and female of a species are very different in appearance and have dramatically different dominant colors, each gets a page spread (with photograph) in the appropriate color section. Each species layout includes an Oklahoma map with ranges where the bird is found in different seasons.<BR>I mention color section, because the book is organized by predominant color. If you see a bird that is mostly yellow, you turn to the \\"yellow\\" section of the book. Page edges are marked to enable you to do this quickly. Look through the photos in that section, and hopefully you will be able to make a quick match. For me, this system works very well.<BR>The book is fairly small, so it can easily be carried in the field. I do wish the binding and pages were more waterproof. I suspect it will need replacement sooner or later. But for this price, I can afford that down the road!<BR>The book doesn't try to do a lot of things, but the few things it does, it does very well. It will do a good job of helping you ID common birds found in Oklahoma. It won't identify rare strays or accidentals, and it won't be much use if you are trying to bird in Connecticut! But within this limited sphere, it is an excellent value.	2002-08-03

Some of the insects covered are butterflies, notably monarchs, locusts, and ladybugs. There is a fair, but not overwhelming, amount of information on each type of insect.  The style is highly readable.  I liked the book so much, I went and bought other of Waldbauer's books.  Highly recommmended!	2002-07-30

Unfortunately, it focuses on birds of the Northern Prairie--Canada, Montana, and the Dakotas mostly. This is shown via a map near the front of the book, but not mentioned on the front or back cover.<br />The big strength of the book is the photos. Excellent photos. I enjoy the book, even though the region is not my preferred one.	2002-07-28

This is an outstanding book on bird photography. It also contains outstanding photos. The closest thing to a weakness with the book is the strong association and support Morris has with Canon products. I'm a Canon person myself, but I sometimes wonder about equipment advice Morris gives in his book or his fine website at birdsasart, because of his contract connection with Canon. <BR>Despite my whining on this subject, the book is excellent if you want to learn about photographing birds. It includes a review of the basic principles of any type of photography, then goes on to give very detailed information on techniques of photographing birds. In addition to camera use, there is good information on tripods, stalking techniques, and some bird photography hotspots around US and Canada.<BR>An excellent book, even for non-Canon shooters!  I gather that it is being released in a paperback edition now, which will be a better value.	2002-07-28

The writing does suffer somewhat from a flowery style in some (not most) parts. The book is not very long, there is a lot of white space on each page, and the excellent photography takes up a lot of space. Still worth reading. At the end is a good annotated bibliography.

The author watched a prairie dog town for several months a year for over a decade, marking each of the animals so he could track individuals.  He describes details of how he made his observations, but most of the book describes the habits and social behavior of prairie dogs, just as the title says.  The book has a LOT of detail, but is readable and interesting. Some is rather surprising, such as prairie dog mothers who attempt to murder their nieces and nephews, but who, if they don't succeed, will nurse these same infants a few weeks later.<BR>Recommended, if you want to \\"know it all\\" about prairie dogs!  For less intense studies and gorgeous photography, look for \\"Prairie Dogs, Sentinels of the Plains.\\"	2002-07-22

I was originally going to rate it two stars--I raised it to three because  the author seems such a nice guy! The book consists of fifty sets of two facing pages, each set devoted to a bird.  On the right is a painting, usually showing a side view of the bird and nothing else.  On the left is a page of text on the bird, usually an anecdote about the author's experience with the species.  Most of the stories are very dated, from the 1940s or 1950s.  I find the book mildly amusing to leaf through when I'm bored, but it is no use as a reference, didn't challenge or inspire me, and I wouldn't dream of taking it into the field.  There are much better uses for your reading dollar.	2002-06-20

Purchasing this book was part of my effort to learn more, and the book was useful for that. The book is very readable, and a very interesting overview of the buffalo.  Unfortunately, it dates from the 1970s, and knowledge has moved on since then.  The most obvious example of this is coverage of \\"Blue Babe\\"--A frozen buffalo from several thousand years ago which was discovered after this book was published.  I'm sure there are other places where our understanding of buffalo and their place in the scheme of the prairie has changed, but I'm not expert enough to identify them.  I really like the book, but would like to see it updated to reflect new findings.	2002-06-17

That's because it is out-standing in the field!  :-)<BR>The book is not intended as a guide to learn everything about birds, it is intended as a pocketable reference you can take with you.  It fits neatly in my front pants pocket, and is stiff and heavily plasticized so that it will withstand wetness and rough handling.  The bird data is very limited--A single side view of each bird species, with the name below.  For the price, and for this purpose, I think it is hard to beat.  You will want to supplement it with a more complete and bulkier field guide, and hopefully with a large non-field book of information on the life and habits of each species--For that purpose, I recommed Kaufman's LIVES OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS or the similar Sibley book.	2002-06-17

The guide has a minimum of information on petroglyphs, and I'm not sure that there is much here that will really be useful in the field.  It contains more of an overview of what petroglyphs are, and a VERY sketchy view of different categories (different cultures, different methods of making petroglyphs, etc.).  I kept being reminded of something I might have been given as a handout in elementary school.<br />I have two criticisms, one is that I don't really see much information here that will be useful in the field.  The other is that the guide is printed on medium-quality paper, and with no plasticizing or water-proofing at all.  It will quickly disintegrate when taken into the field, unless you take strong measures to protect it from moisture, dirt, and rough handling.  I just don't see much use for it, even at this very low price.	2002-06-15

I found myself wishing for more in-depth information.  The book is illustrated with good-quality drawings.  I enjoyed it, but craved more depth.  Probably unrealistic of me to expect it from a book with 150 or so pages of text.<br />The book has a brief coverage of relevant Indian legends, a surprising amount of information on details of the different species of prairie dog, how the prairie dog fits into the ecosystem, and decent coverage of animals with close ties, such as the black-footed ferret.  The main place I felt &quot;shorted&quot; is the brief coverage of prairie dog behavior.	2002-05-13

There are a variety of different types of destinations covered (marine, large mammal, bird, wildflower). The depth of coverage of most sites will be adequate for most people, and the book includes some sites that were new to me.It also has some nice photographs!<BR>  I see no need to include the African sites in a book of this type. I doubt the author intends us to use this book as our sole guide on an African Safari, and any specialized guide we did buy for such a trip would provide far more information than this one. On the other hand, I'm sure there are some good nature spots in Europe, and I can easily see a North American adding one nature stop to a conventional European vacation based on the type of information in this book. If the author had included some European destinations, it would have been more helpful than the African material.<BR>Despite my griping, a decent book.

There are some decent photos, but the focus of the book is on information rather than art. Each article gives the key information on what is to be seen at each site, and advises on the best time of year to visit. The focus is on the natural history here, there is little information on where to stay or dine. But those topics can be left to more \\"ordinary\\" guides! Incidentally, the 100 sites are well-distributed across the country, and I even learned of one in my own state that I didn't know about .<BR>If the topic excites you, I predict you will find the book valuable.	2002-04-03

There are some excellent photographs, and very interesting excerpts from historical documents.<BR>On the negative side, the book isn't very detailed--In the introduction he reveals that it is oriented towards teen-aged readers, though this isn't apparent from the covers of the book.  There are a couple of minor factual howlers that don't detract from the overall worthiness.  There is essentially no coverage of plants, fish, or coral, and surprisingly, the birds covered do not include the more famous endemic Hawaiian birds such as the Nene or any of the Honeycreepers.<BR>Despite these limitations, it is interesting and worthwhile, especially if you haven't read other books on Hawaiian natural history.	2002-03-25

There's not a lot of explanation of some concepts, or even of some creatures that are referred to. I'd have liked to have seen it as a large-format illustrated book with graphics showing exactly what is referred to, whether it be creatures, or even to illustrate a description of how continents moved over time.<BR>One of the valuable features of the book is that the author is an Australian. He doesn't share the assumptions and prejudices that most North Americans have (I am a citizen of the USA), and doesn't hesitate to kick around ideas such as re-introducing elephants to replace the mammoths and mastodons we have lost. This is particularly evident in his strong criticism of the American tradition of exploiting the land for all it is worth.<BR>He does do a good job of illustrating the dramatic effects that people, even primitive ones, have on an ecosystem. And he pointed out some key recurring things that have repeatedly affected North America over millions of years--Such as how our physical geography affects our weather, and what this means for the plants and animals that live here. Or even the remarkable effect squirrels have had on plants, and on the hunter-gatherer cultures here!<BR>I believe that reading the book is going to actually make a long-term change in how I think about many things. Not a common thing to happen. I highly recommend the book, though I suspect many readers will want to supplement it with more specialized ones on the particular subtopics that interest them.	2002-03-17

It does have two chapters I thought were very worthwhile in a more general sense--One on the reasons NOT to move to Hawaii, including some insights on how to predict if you might be unhappy there, and a chapter on the detailed process of packing, moving, and shipping your possessions.<BR>Overall, a rather limited book.  On the other hand, if you are actually considering making the huge leap of moving to Hawaii, the limited cost and short time it takes to read this book may be very good investments, even if you don't fit the model of a settler on the Big Island.  I should give fair warning, I have NOT (yet) moved to Hawaii, so my evaluation of the book is based on logic and instinct rather than personal experience with making the big move!	2002-03-12

There are numerous sightings or locations listed, but only extremely brief details about each (usually a couple of sentences).<br />There are some statements that make me think the author wasn't too critical or thoughtful in screening the information listed--In one case, witnesses are quoted as hearing the whistle of a sailing ship blow. Don't count on being able to locate specific places, even for listings such as stone circles. Very little information or specifics are provided in most cases.<br />As the previous reviewer stated, Mexico is ignored. The rich heritage of \\"mysteriousness\\" in Hawaii is also ignored, though this is more geographically justifiable. The book has numerous illustrations and photographs, but they are not of very good quality.<br />If you are considering purchase of this book, I'd suggest considering Salvatore M.

The book is fairly short, extremely readable, and a good example of how NOT to do this sort of thing.  The author wrote up a list of extreme sports events he wanted to experience, despite being a self-described &quot;couch potato&quot;.  Bane did several items on his &quot;list&quot; without anything like the proper training or preparation.<br />The short length of the book means that a disappointingly brief chapter covers each item on the list.  There's not a lot of technical or &quot;how to do it&quot; information in here, though I doubt many will read this book for that.  I admit I'd hoped for some discussion of the boring old administrative stuff involved in setting up adventures like these. There is some discussion of his internal mental experience, and a sort of rough-and-ready sports psychology.<br />I enjoyed the book, but it scared the bejeezus out of me that anyone would do these things this hastily!  An entertaining read for armchair extreme sporters, but not much more than that.	2002-01-21

The book is a series of chapters focusing on different topics.  Each chapter is headed by an etching of a particular scene.  The chapter explores all the small minutiae of the scene, and instructs you in recognizing what they can tell you about it.  Some of the things you can learn about (specific to New England in some cases) include: What the size of the rocks in a stone fence tells you about past land use; what the number of dead trees in an abandoned beaver pond can tell you; the meaning of a group of gnarled, twisted, and stunted apple trees in a field.  The only thing that restrains my enthusiasm about the book is it's great strength--The etchings. I'd prefer to see photographs, particularly detailed closeups of some of the things discussed.  The book contains blowups of portions of the etchings, and these do help. But I'd like to see the etchings supplemented by photos of real occurrences, showing real color.<BR>Nevertheless, highly recommended!	2002-01-16

It is a potboiler adventure set the Far East in the late 1700s.  The characters are flat, and because the author spends so much time shifting viewpoints between so many different characters, none except the hero achieve much actual depth.  The plot isn't that interesting or exciting.  This was the first of the series I'd read, and I won't be picking up any others.  Not awful, but not the best--Not even average.	2001-06-13

This book makes for entertaining reading.  The book consists of brief two or three page summaries of how to deal with various incidents. There are decent illustrations and text.  I'd expected the text to be light and humorous, but it is very seriously-written.  The authorities cited sound impressive, and some of the situations are things that real people SOMEWHERE have to deal with sometimes, even if most of us will never have to face them ourselves.  But the book is mainly for fun. Some of the articles scare me: the section on \\"how to perform a tracheotomy\\" gives a reasonably good summary of the process, but doesn't warn that the carotid arteries are right next to the area you'll be merrily slashing on. And if you cut into the carotid, the person you are helping will be in a very bad situation, even if you do open the airway....	2001-06-10

There are some VERY interesting anecdotes that give background about why different things happen, or how things came to be--For instance, until reading the book I had not understood the idea behind the airlines that remove seats from their aircraft (as American is now doing, and TWA did a few years ago).  The few new ideas I saw weren't followed up on--For instace, &quot;Use repositioning flights to travel long distances at cheap rates&quot; but with no information on how to search out such flights from the wealth of flight information available on the internet. Unless you are a total novice at this stuff, I don't think you'll learn much that is useful in achieving the goals listed in the title.  If you ARE a novice of that type, the book is okay.	2001-06-10

I learned about some things to do that were not covered in less detailed guides.  The book gives a lot of background and detail on some things that aren't covered well (or at all) in other guides.  This includes just the right amount of information on how to arrange for night-time viewing of turtles laying eggs, for instance, and covers some attractions (such as Butterfly World, north of Miami) that I really enjoy, you which get little or no mention in many guides to Florida.  Be aware that the series of which this manual is a part makes no effort to cover hotel and resturaunt reviews--Those are in a different Michelin series.  If you can possibly live with this limitation, I highly recommend the book!	2001-06-10

Instead of focusing on a single character, this book shifts between several points of view.  And as previous reviewers have noted, there are lengthy digressions inside the head of Peter J. Frigate, a thinly-disguised version of the series author.  As far as plot goes, some of the characters have come up with a much better way to reach the tower at the end of the River--Instead of retracing the twisty path of the River over every inch of the globe, they will just build a dirigible and fly directly there.  To make this possible, Farmer had to retroactively lower the mountains of Riverworld--This is rather lamely explained as an error of perspective.  We also discover that there is something seriously wrong amongst the secret masters of Riverworld.  It's apparent their agents among the resurrectees have lost communication with their bosses, and are desperately trying to re-establish it. Also, the spectre of permanent death has returned once more to humanity. Some of the characters seem a bit retro-70s now.  Of course, it can be argued that their personalities ARE from the 1970s! :-)  Reading it for the first time in two decades, I enjoyed the book, but it certainly didn't advance the storyline very much.	2001-02-16

The book focuses on how Clemens tries to find out the secret of Riverworld by building a magnificent steamboat that will carry him to the tower located at the end of the River.  This book is about the efforts to build the steamboat, not about the journey.  There is a lot of political intrigue in the book, as Twain has to cooperate with others, including unsavory types like the former King John of England.  The book held my interest, and I read it almost in one sitting. Since Farmer has literally everyone in human history to draw from, there are lots of interesting characters, and Farmer writes the story competently.  I recommend the book, but it would probably best to read TO YOUR SCATTERED BODIES GO first.	2001-02-11

Some of my favored books from those &quot;old days&quot; don't hold up well.  But this one does! Farmer came up with a awe-inspiring setting that gives him access to literally every human who ever lived, as well as some non-human characters, and the ability to shift settings quickly and dramatically. The hero of this book is Sir Richard Burton, the 19th Century British explorer and adventurer. After Burton breathes his last on Earth, he finds himself (after a puzzling interlude or two) reborn on another planet among everyone who ever lived on earth.  All their basic needs are provided for, and in this new world, even further death is not permanent; since humanity is freed from the need to struggle for life, it's necessities, or even for many of its pleasures, there is time for something else. The focus of the series is on how different people used this unique opportunity.  Burton uses it to try to uncover the motivations behind the beings responsible for the resurrection. Fortunately for him, he has a secret ally among the resurrectors.  The book is interesting, very readable, and not terribly deep.  I enjoyed it, and am going to re-read the whole series.  You'll learn a lot about Burton in the book, but it did not inspire in me (originally or now) the fascination it appears to have inspired in some other reviewers.	2001-02-10

Shows our Sore Spot	The most interesting thing about this book is not the book itself, but the reactions it excites.  It has drawn an incredible number of reviewers, many of whom are very critical and emotional about it.  Our culture has a sore spot where power is concerned, and this is a good illumination of it.  As others have noted, the various laws are contradictory and inconsistent.  The book openly admits this, by giving examples of &quot;reversal&quot;.  It would be nice if the book openly proclaimed that power and politics are all situational--And in fact this point is made in the book.  But it probably wouldn't look enticing to potential buyers if they put it on the cover!  The book does have some fascinating accounts of past experiences in it, and is interesting to read on that basis.  I'm even willing to agree that carefully reading all these accounts of power-grabbing will probably help an avid powermonger become more aware of the dynamics of different situations.  But it isn't going to make you into a Kennedyesque figure in and of itself (thank goodness!).  The book is beautifully designed and laid out.	2001-01-13

The book has three main divisions, 1) the eruption of Mount St. Helen, 2) some miscellanous events in Indonesia, Alaska, and Columbia, and 3) the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. There is only a limited amount of information about how volcanos form and erupt in the book, and it is scattered throughout the book. There is a lot of detail about the frantic activities of geologists during an eruption, and a good discussion of the quandary involved in balancing too early a warning with too late a warning. There are some very dramatic events here--The horrific stories of the people who were too close when Mount St. Helens erupted; the pilots who flew a Boeing 747 as a glider when all four engines were knocked out by volcanic ash; and geologists helicoptering near an erupting volcano to restore a data link so that a clear picture of what's happening within the volcano can be regained. There's a lot of diplomatic and bureaucratic infighting between factions in USGS, and among other actors involved in making warnings of volcanic activity. The book would benefit greatly from more and better quality pictures. There are relatively few pictures, and the quality is not good. I was fortunate to see a Travel Channel show on the eruption of Mount St. Helens right after reading the relevant chapters, but most people can't count on that! Despite my whining about lack of good photos, I enjoyed the book, it has some interesting accounts in it. But I'd hoped to learn more about the science behind the volcano.	2000-12-31

There is very brief information on a number of suppliers of each type of adventure.  The commentary provided on each is brief and to the point.  I found two problems, one of which was very important--The book is rather dated. It was published in 1995.  As a result, there's not even a hint of the internet in it.  Also, I suspect some of the suppliers are out of business, or at least have moved on to new address/phone numbers.  The other problem is that it is organized by activity. So it is easy to find providers of llama hiking tours (there really is such a thing!) in several states.  But if you are going to be in Poughkeepsie for several days, and want to know about adventurous things to do there, the only way to find out is to go through each category of adventure looking for references to Poughkeepsie.  I'd wait for an updated edition--And I hope there is such an edition, this is a fine idea.	2000-12-30

Most, but not all are Caribbean islands. There are also descriptions of other &quot;traditional&quot; snorkeling places, such as the Yucatan Penninsula and Hawaii. And there are two large sections on snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands. Several snorkeling sites are listed at each separate location, and useful advice and information is given for most.  All sites are rated on a 1 to 5 &quot;starfish&quot; point system. About the only criticism I have of the book is that much of the hotel information seems to be pulled directly from the hotel's advertising about themselves.  A little more independent commentary would be nice.  The information is still useful as a starting point. Finally, for each location, there is useful information on weather, how to get there, and when to go. If you have the first edition of this book, I see little reason to purchase this new edition, however. I do wish a few other sites or activities had been included, in particular snorkeling with whale sharks off Northwest Australia. That's something that interests me, but there seems very little information on it out there. If you travel to snorkel, and don't have the First Edition, GET THIS ONE!	2000-12-30

And there are some fascinating state parks out there. This book seeks to fill that gap by providing brief but adequate information on over 200 parks in all 50 states. If you do the math, you'll see that there can be only brief descriptions of 200 parks fitted into this 384 page book. But there is a surprising amount of information crammed into each of the articles, even including some nice, but small photos. The main service this guide performs is highlighting the best parks in the Park System of each state, and giving you enough information to get there and enjoy them. It is not (and realistically cannot be) an exhaustive guide to each listed park, or to all state parks. Well worth buying if the subject interests you.

It just seems like things never take off, and I was never thrilled the way I was by the first book.  The climactic &quot;quest&quot; (admittedly a poor choice of words, but I have none better) doesn't capture the imagination like the descent into Hell of the original, and climax seems short and unsatisfying.

It gives maps, driving directions, and advice on the best way to enter the water at a given site.  There is a useful chart that classifies the different snorkel sites as to how good the snorkeling is (water clarity, fish variety) and how easy water entry is.

It gives very specific advice and travel directions, down to the level of &quot;turn left at the blue two-story house&quot; to many destinations, lots of which you won't find in the typical Frommer's or Fodor's guidebook.  It is very blunt and negative in a few cases, which is refreshing. I didn't get full advantage of this book on the first part of my Big Island trip, because I read it ahead of time, and left it in the hotel room, taking only my U. of Hawaii map with me when out and about.  This is my usual procedure with guidebooks, because they usually aren't specific enough to be useful when out on the road seeking anything but the biggest and grandest activities or sites.  Later in the trip, I realized my mistake, and kept it on the seat beside me while driving.  One of the best features of the book is a list of &quot;adventures&quot; near the end of the book which are just that. Adventures, some of which are even mildly risky. I only did one of them (snorkeling with manta rays) but it was well worth doing. If you want to visit the Big Island, and get out of your Kona Coast resort, I highly recommend you purchase this book, read it ahead of time, and take it with you on the road! The only criticism I have of the book is not the authors' fault, and is inevitable in a book this specific--Some of the information invariably becomes outdated over time.  For instance, the manta rays I referred to are no longer appearing regularly at the location listed in this book.  This sort of thing is inevitable, and is the price of being so specific and helpful.  But the book is probably due for a third edition before too long...	2000-12-10

It is an overall guide, and I think you will probably also benefit by supplementing this book with a specific guidebook oriented towards the island(s) you are spending most of your time on.  Avid snorkelers (I am one) will also benefit from the Malinowski series on snorkeling in specific islands in Hawaii.

Useful for penetrating the immense amount of information to identify the most unusual or spectacular attractions on each island.	2000-12-10

It has general advice on visiting Hawaii, how to get the best deals, etc., followed by a chapter on each of the major islands.  It does not cover islands a new visitor is less likely to visit, such as Lanai and Molokai.  The specific chapters on each island give useful coverage of major attractions or activities, and very detailed commentary on a limited number of hotels/resorts/B&amp;Bs.  I highly recommend the book, but once you have decided to visit, I recommend that you buy specific books covering the island(s) you want to visit.  If you want to spend more than a few days on a given island, you will probably want more detailed coverage than given in this book.  Despite this, the book is VERY valuable for a first-time visitor who wants to figure out the who, what, where, why and how of a Hawaiian vacation.	2000-12-10

An adequate guide to identifying the water creatures you'll see in the water near Hawaii.  It has very broad coverage for the size, and packs a lot of information.  On the negative side, the book is very small-format, which means it is convenient to take on the boat or in a fanny pack.  But it could be improved by making the page and binding more waterproof--It won't last long on a boat.  And the small format means that it is unsatisfactory for casual reading at home before or after a trip--The photographs are postage stamp-sized, and the descriptive text is VERY brief. Finally, the book has dual Japanese and English texts.  This shouldn't bother me, but for some reason it does.  If nothing else, it vividly illustrates how many Japanese tourists there are in Hawaii!	2000-11-19

It does have very good and specific information on snorkeling. It also has reasonable information on non-aquatic sights and things to do, though only the VERY high points.  And has reviews of resturaunts and places to stay, including a few very cheap ones that won't be featured prominently in your typical travel guide. The maps are useless. Don't use it as your only travel guide on a trip.  But it is useful, if snorkeling is high on your priorities there. Of limited value otherwise (as the title suggests).	2000-11-17

I have already dreamt up enough vacations to last the rest of my life, and I've only had this book two days. The book has short, two or three page descriptions of 132 hotels.  Most of them are based on old castles or palaces, though there are a couple based on convents, and at least one is an old royal hospital.  They are all appropriate for the book.  There is usually an exterior photo and an interior photo, and good information on the history of the place, both as a castle (or whatever) and how it came to be a hotel.  There is fairly detailed information on accommodations, including comments on virtues and vices of specific rooms in some of the hotels (at least one specific room is listed as allegedly haunted).

I didn't like it as well as the first book, and it comes close to being a three-star novel rather than four. The book delivers the expected thud and blunder,  though I got a little confused about what was happening in the middle of  the book.  The only serious complaint I have about the book is one that  sometimes pops up in David Drake's work:  One of the characters is  EXTREMELY morbid.  To the point where it becomes annoying.  Ms. Mundy is  repeatedly described as having thoughts along the lines of &quot;It made no  difference to her whether the spaceship blew up and incinerated everyone  aboard, or took off as planned.  But she admired competence, and wasn't  going to let failure be her fault.&quot;  At one point, I found her  perpetual morbidity to be so bad I considered not finishing the book.   Fortunately, this seems to let up about halfway through the book, and I  really enjoyed the last half. Worth reading, but read WITH THE LIGHTNINGS  first.	2000-07-16

I gather that this book is co-authored, so don't know if this novel is typical of Cussler's solo work or not.  In any event, I found the  book fast-paced and entertaining.  It did hold my interest.  It is NOT  particularly well-written, there are times when a paragraph reads like a  list of brand names of scuba or paramilitary equipment, and other times  when there is too much clumsy and lengthy descriptive prose. <br />All the  major heroes are charismatic, super-competent, calm, and saintly.  I almost  started laughing out loud when I read the lengthy list of academic degrees,  accomplishments and skills one hero had built up by the age of 30, any one  of which most of us would be happy to achieve in a working lifetime.  The  heroes do get hurt and do make mistakes, but never seem to suffer more than  inconvenience because of it. I kept expecting someone to cry out:  &quot;Zounds! It was only a flesh wound!&quot;<br />As an archeology buff, I  will refrain from posting my opinion of the archeology in the book, since  Amazon would delete most of the words.  I'll just say that if America had  been visited by pre-Columbian Old Worlders as frequently as suggested in  the book, the major hazard they'd have faced would have been colliding with  each other at sea like the Andrea Doria and Stockholm do in this  book!<br />Lest this all sound hypercritical, I will say that the book did  keep me reading and interested.

Books	4	34	37	N	N	Interesting and novel	Upfront I must confess that though I am very knowledgeable about history and science, I am neither a paleontologist nor an expert on Classical History.  But I was intrigued by this book, and I found it  fascinating.<br />The author begins the book with a slam-banger of an  idea--The first chapter discusses the idea that the Greek legend of  Griffons originated from Greek fossil observations in Asia.  The author has  very convincing evidence for this, based on how Griffons were described and  handled differently by ancient writers, specific details of ancient  writing, and fossil evidence still in place in modern times.  I found it  fascinating.<br />The later chapters are still interesting, though don't have  the novel impact of the first chapter.  The ancient attitude towards  fossils is discussed, including quarrels between city-states over  possession of fossils which were thought to be the remains of heroes and  demigods.<br />I found the book interesting and convincing, but I cannot help  wondering if maybe there is evidence being ignored when it would discredit  the author's hypothesis. I lack enough expertise in either field to be  sure.  I fell for Von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods as a teen-ager, and  the experience keeps me suspicious of revolutionary ideas in archeology and  ancient history, even to this day!	2000-06-07

I enjoyed the book, in fact I finally stopped reading it at 2 am one morning so I could get to bed and get up at 7! I finished the last  1/4 of the book the next night. It may be the break in reading that cut the  drama for me--I was just not as impressed with this book as with others in  the series, and definitely not as impressed as I was with David Drake's  other work.  I suspect Drake did much of the overall plotting while Flint  did most of the grunt work of writing (I have no evidence for this, just a  suspicion).<br />The book is a good, enjoyable adventure yarn.  As another  reviewer has pointed out, it is predictable, but at least things do go  wrong for the heroes from time to time. In fact, various characters in the  book repeatedly harp on how things go wrong in combat.<br />There are repeated  references in the book to historical parallels with real-world battles.   Without dwelling on it, I will say there is a plot reason for doing this.   But I suspect that readers who are not history maniacs (I am a history  maniac) will find them puzzling or distracting. I didn't find the author's  writing style as annoying as some of the other reviewers, but I did have  trouble at first keeping track of the characters and events of recent  novels in the series. I have completely forgotten some of the events of  previous books, and this book didn't gently remind me of them as I might  wish for. I hope the authors don't let the characters numbers  &quot;grow&quot; anymore in future installments.<br />Good book, but not a  great book.

It starts with the first troubled mission shortly after World War II and runs past the end of  the Cold War.<br />The stories are gripping, and would often be worth reading  as fiction.  It is amazing that they are fact.  Some of the tales told are  questionably related to the topic, such as the hunt for the US submarine  Scorpion after it was lost, but even those are so interesting I will  forgive the author for putting them in.<br />If the topic interests you at  all, I predict you will enjoy the book.	2000-06-07

The author focuses  on trying to work effectively with your personality type.

The various short episodes include, experiences as an medical student, visiting psychics in England, travelling in remote villages in Asia, climbing Mount Kilminajaro,  working with Sean Connery on THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, and new age  explorations.  But the episodes all tie together to make a point. The most  surprising thing in the book is that Crichton makes a very strong case for  &quot;psychic phenomena&quot;. From his work and education, I'd always  assumed he would be a hard-science materialist, but he is not. He makes an  interesting case for his viewpoint, and I'm sure he's sincere (he has  little to gain from making such claims).  But I can't say he convinced me.

This sounds pretty dull, but it isn't. The book is readable and interesting.  The subject is also an important one, at  least if you depend on information from charts.  It is especially valuable  if you regularly prepare charts for others.  The title is sort of stolen  from an even better book called HOW TO LIE WITH STATISTICS. That is an even  more valuable book which teaches some of the same lessons as this one.	2000-03-26

Exclusively for Today's Leaders and Managers	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Expensive, but a lot of useful information	A CD-Rom jammed with articles from EXECUTIVE EXCELLENCE. I actually got my copy as a bonus for subscribing a couple of years ago. Many of the articles are interesting, but they are all quite short, almost MTV-ish. This seems to be the preferred style for this publication. If you are a fan of Warren Bennis, or one of the writers who regularly contribute to that publication, this is a good way to pick up some new material from your favored writer. The articles are on a variety of topics, which means that there will probably be something for everyone with an interest in this subject, but by the same token, there will be a lot that won't interest you. The CD includes a search engine that is workable. I benefitted from the magazine and the CD, but they didn't set my world on fire.	2000-03-26

And that is the case.  It is lengthy, thorough, but surprisingly readable.  Chapters talk about various subtopics in modest detail.  Often, I could wish for more specifics, but for a book of this  scope of subject, that would not be practical.  Illustrations and graphics  are informative and useful. The book is timeless, though new research  of course makes the new editions necessary--We still have a copy of the  first edition (from 1963) where I work, but a copy of the latest edition is  essential if you work or study in the radiation field.	2000-03-25

In some cases I think I &quot;get&quot; the theme he's trying to illustrate, and in  others I don't. I'd have been happier if he would have come out and bluntly  stated the point he is trying to make in each chapter. I guess I just don't  understand stuff unless I'm hit over the head with it! Despite this, there  are lots of lovely photos, and some interesting facts in the text. The two  improvements I'd suggest are 1) Tell the reader exactly the point you are  trying to make (don't leave it as an exercise for the student), and 2) put  in some diagrams with labelled parts showing the exact physical  relationships between parts of various circles when these relationships are  being discussed in the text. If this sounds too whiney, I must point out  that I bought the book in preparation for a trip to Cornwall where I'm  going to visit some of the circles described in the book, and I do believe  I'll enjoy my visits more because of having read this book.	2000-03-20

Kotter on What Leaders Really Do (Harvard Business Review Book)	Books	3	9	14	N	N	Sound work, but brief, overpriced, and non-groundbreaking	The book is rather brief for the price. As you'd expect from the publisher, the material is sound. Basically, the first half of the book deals with initiating change in an organization, and ensuring that the change lasts.  It is useful, but not earth-shattering. Much of it reminds  me of Schein's ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP, which covers this in  a lot more depth. After the section on change, we have three  moderate-length articles on power, managing your boss, and the proper  activities of general managers.  These are all decent and useful pieces,  but again I didn't find anything earth-shattering. If you find the book  appealing, I'd wait for the trade paperback edition.	2000-03-19

If you enjoy &quot;displaced in time&quot; stories, or if the idea interests you, you can expect to like the book. The hero is a PhD-to-be who gets mysteriously plunged back to Rome in its declining  years, and takes it on himself to use what he knows and avert the coming  dark ages.  It is funny in places, sad in a couple of places, and exciting  all through. The other part of this book is a rather forgettable story by  an excellent writer, David Drake.  If you enjoy this book, look up  &quot;Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen&quot; by Piper, or &quot;Island in the Sea  of Time&quot; by S.M. Stirling	2000-03-15

I used this book (actually the 3rd edition) in preparing for my comprehensive exams for my master's degree. The title is descriptive. The book is short excerpts of key writings on the organization theory. The selection of readings is appropriate. The only complaint I have is that sometimes I wished I had the complete book in question! On the other hand, some of this stuff is really dry. If you are pursuing the field in an academic way, this is a valuable book.  But I can't imagine reading it for enjoyment or idle curioisity.	2000-03-15

The book has a series of chapters on the expected topics, like dealing with hiring, firing, and the personnel system. It is a worthwhile book, but doesn't have anything startlingly new or original.  Still one of the few books to treat this subject from a practioner's view  rather than an academic one. If the subject interests you, I'd suggest  reading Haass's &quot;The Power to Persuade&quot; in addition to (not  instead of) this book.	2000-03-11

Not wonderful	Basically, this book is about a coal-mining town in West Virginia which is mysteriously transported to Germany at the time of the Thirty Years War. This theme has been developed before, going back to Mark Twain (or maybe  further). To my knowledge, S.M. Stirling was the first major writer to move  a whole community back to another time, with his Nantucket Series, and now  Eric Flint seeks to get his version in. I am a fan of this genre, so I  expected to enjoy this book, and I did. One way that it is different from  most of these stories is that it focuses on the &quot;little  people&quot;--The movers and shakers of this book are not professors or  military officers or big-time politicians.  The hero is a failed boxer who  is a minor union official. On the other hand, the book is filled with  affectionate praise for King Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus Adolphus was a  real historical figure, and if you don't know who he is, don't worry, you  will know when you finish the book! I enjoyed the book, think most who are  interested by this idea will enjoy it. Only criticism I have are that too  much time is spent with the time travellers offstage, describing the Battle  of Breitenfield, a real historical battle. Some may be disappointed that a  minimum of time is spent describing clever technological  improvisations--These seem to be a staple of this genre, but there isn't  much of it here. If you enjoyed this book, I'd look up H. Beam Piper's LORD  KALVAN OF OTHERWHEN, S.M. Stirling's ISLAND IN THE SEA OF TIME, and L.  Sprague deCamp's LEST DARKNESS FALL.	2000-02-28

I enjoyed ASHES, but it was definitely not the best of the Honor Harrington books.  Fans of the series will enjoy it, and find it worth their money. Other reviewers have pointed out that this book features Honor  more as a teacher and mover-shaker than as a warship or fleet commander. I  felt it started out a little slowly, but that feeling soon passed. The  major &quot;news&quot; I can mention without committing spoilers is that  there are MAJOR changes in the Harrington universe here. Important people  die, and the politics change dramatically. If you are a fan of the series,  you will enjoy the book. If you don't know the series, do not buy this book  (yet), instead go buy ON BASILISK STATION! By the way, some of the reviews  published before this one commit some serious spoilers. Before you read on,  you have been warned....	2000-02-27

It's tough to keep track of all the characters. It's so much like the real World War II you can find the Winter War and the Manhattan Project in it. It's not as good as Guns of the South,  Case of the Toxic Spell Dump, or even WorldWar. It's a good buy for  Turtledove fans. It would be wise to buy it in paperback, not hardback.	2000-01-24

I did enjoy the book, but found it somewhat unsatisfying. On several occasions I felt confused about what had happened. In one  particular case, Hoare is attacked and somehow subdued, and I have no clue  how it happened! A passing remark by one of the villains later alluded to  how the hero was subdued, but his comment didn't make sense to me. The period  stuff is decent, though not as in-depth as I expected it to be. If you want  sailing adventure, I'd go for \\"The Revolution at Sea\\" series instead.	1999-09-15

Valuable checklists	This book is a minimally-rewritten version of &quot;Taking Charge&quot; which Smith published a few years ago. The book contains useful and extremely pragmatic advice for managers and leaders. It is more oriented  towards &quot;big shots&quot; than first line managers, but there is value  for anyone who manages people. Biggest criticism--There is not an  overriding theme in the book, it is a collection of chapters on individual  subjects.  Biggest attaboy--The book has a number of checklists that are  useful. The author is a former military officer, and that shows in his  examples, but the advice he gives is broadly applicable.	1999-07-07

And I enjoyed this book. But I didn't learn a great deal. If you known almost nothing about World War II in the Pacific, and want a broad,  lightweight introduction, this book is okay. If you are looking for an  in-depth book, or even a book with some new insights on a few detailed  areas, this book probably doesn't fit the bill.	1999-06-28

The book focuses on taking a broad view of all aspects of the problem, not on a highly-analytical breaking-down of a  situation. This is fine, though not earth-shatteringly good or original.  Unfortunately, the middle half of the book is an unfocused meandering about  the contributions of Hollywood to violence in society, and then to the  problems faced in managing nuclear weapons. The last part of the book has a  fairly good discussion of the four basic Jungian personality types, and how  personality type affects problem-solving. This is pretty good stuff, but it  is about the length of a magazine article. Not a worthless book, but not a particularly good value for your  money.	1999-05-24

Hyman Rickover Built the Nuclear Navy	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Biased, but readable and interesting	The author holds Admiral Rickover in extremely high regard, so much so that the book reads more like advertising than non-fiction. I can't recall a single case in the book where Rickover is described as making a mistake,  being unreasonable, or doing something dumb! People in a position to know  tell me that Rickover was extremely difficult to work with, especially when  challenged by a subordinate, but you'd never guess at such problems from  Rockwell's book! Rickover is presented as stern and demanding, but always  fair. Despite my nit-picking, this is still a worthwhile book for someone  interested in the subject. Rickover definitely knew how to get things done,  and deserves great credit for his work on making nuclear power reactors  into a working concept. It is highly readable, and the Rickover quotes  sprinkled through the pages are worth the purchase price. A lengthy, but  more balanced account is in Norman Polmar's book, Rickover.	1999-01-15

It has good explanations of what you will see, and of the author's  view of the significance of it. But you must keep in mind that the author  takes Ancient Egyptian beliefs more seriously than most 20th Century  Americans--Some of his ideas are a bit dotty by my lights. But he is fair  and reasonably unbiased. The book format is tall, narrow, and  thick--probably about as small as possible to get the information across,  but still larger than ideal if you plan to take it into the field with you  in Egypt. The size ends up not being totally satisfactory for either  leisurely reading or as a field companion. Still the only book I'm aware of  that makes a serious effort to be an &quot;on-the-spot&quot; companion for  viewing Egyptian antiquities in a studious way.	1998-12-21

This book is just what it says--Aerial photographs of various monuments of ancient Egypt. I found it extremely satisfying.  I visited Egypt about 18 months ago, and was in many of these same places--The opportunity to see  them from a different vantage point was enjoyable.  I love the book, though  I wish the photos were in color rather than in black and white.

The text is intriguing and informative, and the photography is excellent. Not only does it cover the pyramids most familiar to the layman, but it also extends to the  lesser-known (and less durable) Egyptian pyramids, as well as giving  coverage of the efforts in Nubia to copy the Egyptian work with smaller  pyramids. The level of detail was just right for a fascinated  non-archeologist such as myself.	1998-12-15

Drake writes about a group of sailors (and one civilian) trapped on a planet which changes sides in an ongoing interstellar war. They change from welcome guests, to being hunted  by their former hosts. If you are a David Drake fan, you will recognize  this as being very similar to the situation in THE FORLORN HOPE--And you  will be right. But this is not merely a rehashing of the same theme--The  story is different, and very enjoyable and moving. To survive, the  protagonists have to learn to depend on each other. I felt THE FORLORN HOPE  was a better book, but this book is still excellent.	1998-11-03

It appears he would approve of the car company that declined to fix gas-tank flaws they discovered in a vehicle, because it was cheaper to pay off injury lawsuits than to conduct a recall. Still worth reading.  The author does explain himself in detail, and you will understand the points he wanted to make in the book.	1998-10-18

But I  don't feel the author adds enough &quot;meat&quot; to make the book the  money. The most valuable part is a section on identifying &quot;exceptional  individuals&quot; in job interviews.  This material could have been put in  a good-sized magazine article or essay. I didn't find the bulk of the book  terribly useful, and (unlike the previous reviewer) I felt the anecdotes  didn't add that much.

Many management books prescribe one management method as the cure-all  which would resolve all problems. Others suggest that one management  philosophy is the only one appropriate for a given organization.  This book  suggests that there are several basic management philosophies, and that  organizations go through different cycles with a different managerial  approach being correct for each stage in the cycle. The best managers are  those who are able to determine the best approach at a given time, use it  until it is no longer needed, then switch to the appropriate new strategy.  I could have wished for more depth, but still found the book worthwhile.   I'd also like to have seen more on becoming a &quot;master manager&quot;,  but that seems to have been reserved for another book!	1998-09-29

Some of the stories have  interesting notions, but don't really do anything spectacular with them.  The book would have been improved if the editors had included an afterword  on each story discussing how the incident described in the story was  different from the real world, and (if applicable) why that's important.  Some of the historical episodes, such as Bodicca's revolt against the  Romans, and the flight of the Goeben and Breslau in World War I, are rather  obscure. The voyage of the Goeben, for example, was literally a crucial  episode in world history, but most people are not World War I buffs and  won't understand this, and how important the alternative resolution in this  story was.	1998-09-29

She began her academic career determined to scientifically prove  the paranormal, but over time became disenchanted when her experiments  repeatedly failed to find &quot;psi&quot;, and she found flaws in the  experimental methods used by researchers who reported success. The book was  originally published in 1986 or so, and has been updated with a few  chapters added to the end. The book is valuable because the author is not a  traditional debunker. I get the feeling she thinks there is something  valuable to be discovered in studying &quot;altered states&quot;, but she  believes they are a construct of your mind, and doesn't think that psi is  involved in them. I would have greatly appreciated a chapter trying to  summarize all her ideas--There are a number of intriguing thoughts  scattered through the book.	1998-09-22

Unfortunately, it doesn't go into any particular  topic in sufficient detail to be truly satisfying. Also, I fully agree with  the comment of Vincent O'Sullivan--Despite the title, the book does not do  a good job of analyzing WHY people believe weird things. I'd give it 3 and  1/2 stars instead of four, if I could. It's still worth reading if an  overview of fringe beliefs with critical commentary is interesting to you.	1998-09-22

Groves shamelessly includes in the book a copy of a memo from a White House official saying that General Groves shouldn't be appointed head of the project, because he &quot;lacked the necessary tact&quot; to deal with the scientists!  Groves gives an enjoyable and interesting account of what he did, and why he did it.  He is self-serving on rare occasions, but doesn't hesitate to include incidents where he made a mistake.  He also includes amusing stories such as the raid on Fort Knox for hundreds of tons of silver for wire to use in a sophisticated machine (copper was too hard to get due to its other uses in the war effort); and the tale of the Treasury Department auditors who required DuPont Corporation to return thirty-one cents of their one dollar profit on their &quot;cost plus a dollar&quot; project to construct a factory costing tens of millions of dollars.  The flow of the book occasionally suffers, because Groves will break the continuity to follow a special topic all the way through to the end of the war.  However it is still great reading. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject, or anyone interested in management of large projects.	1997-10-10

It describes an episode of women's activism on health issues before activism was considered the proper province of women.  During and after World War I, hundreds of women, mostly young and unmarried, were employed to paint the dials of watches with self-illuminating paint containing Radium.  Some of the women began to fear for the job's effects on their health, but had great difficulty in getting any action taken.  This book describes their efforts to have these hazards corrected, and the problems they had dealing with uncaring factory management, inept government officials, skeptical members of the medical community, and eventually with the courts. It is disturbing, yet fascinating!  Highly recommended	1997-10-10

History lesson included	Harry Turtledove was a professor of history at UCLA, and his deep knowledge of history shows in this book. It is a snappin' good yarn, but also offers a LOT of insight into why the Civil War was fought, and into the minds of abolitionists and slaveholders.    Highly recommended, both as a piece of fiction and as a way to learn something about the issues behind the Civil War.  I recommend it.	1997-09-12

I did enjoy many of the anecdotes and situations discussed. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the book offered much useful advice to those who want to lead. The author offers brief bullet points at the end of each chapter that summarize key lessons, but most of them are fairly self-evident, and they are not well-developed.  This type of book seems to be popular lately. People looking for historical lessons based on real figures would do better to read &quot;Lincoln on Leadership&quot; or the old Attila the Hun books by Wess Roberts	1997-07-25

He analyzes different types of conversation, and has suggestions on which ones are most useful in motivating and gaining commitment.  In particular, he urges that conversations be moved away from &quot;past-focused&quot; orientation in favor of a possibilty-focused discussion that can be used to encourage action.  The only complaint I have is that I wish some of the material was more thoroughly fleshed-out. But I still found the book readable and useful	1997-07-25

The essays are of varying quality, and not all of them will be relevant to everyone, but it is a valuable book on a subject that isn't well-covered elsewhere	1997-07-14
