Krugman served on the advisory board at Enron in 1999 during the Clinton Administration. During that period, Enron was getting many Ex Im bank loans rubber stamped.  Enron became a regular on the Ron Brown Commerce Department flights to drum up business overseas.  The flights were obviously a pay for play deal. During this period, Enron was also shoveling $3 billion or more into the Dabhol power plant in India.  Enron owned 65% of the plant but it became a black hole and was one of the straws that finally broke Enron's back.   <br /> <br />If we are headed towards a depression as Mr. Krugman opines then it may have a lot to due with corrupt crony capitalism and fraud.  Mr. Krugman should have given us more information on what he actually did at Enron.  He wrote a lot of articles about the Enron fraud but he always left out how he was on an advisory board at the company.	2005-02-15

It appears that Accuracy In Media has a few questions about this book.  Looks like amazingly corrupt Kofi Annan gets another free pass. Why are U.S. taxpayers being forced to fund this corrupt den of theives and murderers called the UN? Ted Turner is such a weasel.  He now makes his living murdering buffaloes for his buffalo steak house.  What a parasite.  <br /> <br />Accuracy In Media press release below:  <br /> <br />NBC Reporter Refuses to Disclose How Much She Received From Ted Turner <br /> <br />WASHINGTON -- A New York Sun report today indicates that Lisa Fasulo, NBC and MSNBC correspondent to the UN, has defended her work and denied a conflict of interest stemming from a grant she received from Ted Turner's United Nations Foundation to help pay for her book, An Insider's Guide to the UN. News of the grant was first reported by Accuracy in Media (AIM) Editor Cliff Kincaid. <br /> <br />AIM is calling on NBC News to reveal how much money Fasulo has taken from Ted Turner's UN Foundation. In a column released on Wednesday, Kincaid charged that the financial relationship may explain why she is so pro-UN in her 2004 book. Fasulo \\"would not say how much money she received from the United Nations Foundation, which Ted Turner created in 1997 with $1 billion of his fortune,\\" The New York Sun has now reported in its follow-up story. Among other things, the book whitewashes UN chief Kofi Annan's role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide. <br /> <br />In email messages to Ms. Fasulo that were not answered, Kincaid asked her: \\"How much money did you accept from the UN Foundation, Better World Campaign, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund?\\" These are entities that she acknowledges helped underwrite the book project in some manner. Kincaid also asked her: \\"In the part of your book on Kofi Annan and Rwanda, you ignore the genocide fax from Annan's office showing that he refused authorization for UN troops on the ground to prevent genocide. Why did you ignore that?\\" <br /> <br />Accuracy In Media (AIM) is a non-profit, grassroots citizens watchdog of the news media that critiques botched and bungled news stories and sets the record straight on important issues that have received slanted coverage. <br /> <br />To schedule an interview with AIM Editor Cliff Kincaid, contact Anne Tyrrell at (703)739-5920 or atyrrell@sbpublicaffairs.com  <br /> <br />	2005-02-07

North Vietnam was ready to surrender conditionally until Kerry &amp; Fonda rendered their aid. <br />As the American POWs returned home in 1973, they spoke out about the inhumane treatment and torture they had suffered as prisoners of war. Their stories directly contradicted Jane Fonda's earlier statements of 1972. <br />Some of the American POWs such as Senator John McCain, a former Presidential candidate, stated that he was tortured by his guards for refusing to meet with Jane Fonda and her group. Jane Fonda, in her response to these new allegations, referred to the returning POWs as being &quot;hypocrites and liars.&quot; <br />The Wall Street Journal (August 3, 1995) published an interview with Bui Tin who served on the General Staff of the North Vietnam Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. During the interview Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory. <br />Mr. Tin responded &quot;It was essential to our strategy&quot; referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets. He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts &quot;to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement.&quot; Visits to Hanoi made by persons such as Jane Fonda, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and various church ministers &quot;gave us confidence that we should hold on in the face of battlefield reverses.&quot; <br />Mr. Tin surmised that &quot;America lost because of its democracy; through dissent and protest it lost the ability to mobilize a will to win.&quot; Mr. Tin further advised that General Vo Nguyen Giap (Commanding General of the NorthVietnam Army) said the 1968 Tet Offensive was a defeat. Gen. Giap in his book, made the same statement, adding that they were surprised by the news media reporting and the demonstrations in America. Instead of seeking a conditional surrender, they would now hold out because America's resolve was weakening and victory could be theirs.<br />From 1969 to the end of the war over 20,000 American soldiers lost their lives in a war that the United States did not have the resolve to win. If General Giap was accurate in his assessment that North Vietnam was going to seek a conditional surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, but stopped due to the sensationalism of the American news media and the anti-war protests following the 1968 Tet Offensive, it follows that those who participated in these anti-war activities have to share partial responsibility for those 20,000 + Americans deaths. <br />We won the war on the battlefield but lost it back home on the college campuses and in the city streets. <br />Americans must realize that there are agents* operating in this Country attempting to undermine our Country and it's leadership through our democratic principles in an effort to achieve a foreign country's goal. A prime example of such a person during the Vietnam War was Jane Fonda, an admitted Socialist, who blatantly supported North Vietnam. * Agent - Any person who works to obtain the goals of another nation either for money or for their own political beliefs. <br />A valuable lesson was taught by North Vietnam to other nations on how the United States may be defeated by fighting a two front war - the battlefield and the American home front. We must be aware of this vulnerability. <br />In 1975, after the fall of the South Vietnam Government, Jane Fonda returned to Hanoi with her newborn son Troy for a celebration in her honor for the work she had done for North Vietnam. During the celebration, her son was christened after a Viet Cong hero, Nguyen Van Troi. Troi had attempted to assassinate Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara while on his visit to South Vietnam in 1963. The South Vietnam Government executed Troi for this attempted assassination.	2004-03-03

The book fails to mention how Kerry smeared Vietnam Vets by calling them all &quot;babykillers&quot; in front of the Senate. <br />Much of Kerry's speech before Congress painted his fellow GIs as so brutal that, today, they could easily be mistaken for Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen killers.<br />He reported to Congress that U.S. soldiers had &quot;personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam.&quot; <br />C. Stewart Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International (Kerry's cousin), was awarded a contract worth billions designating Colliers International as the exclusive real estate agent representing Vietnam.<br />Kerry's group, The Vietnam Veterans Against the War Organization, was funded by Jane Fonda.  <br />Jane Fonda personally sought out returning American soldiers from Vietnam to solicit them to publicly speak out against American atrocities against Vietnamese women and children during her broadcasts.  North Vietnamese officials based in Canada allegedly coordinated her broadcasts. <br />In 1972 Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden and others traveled to North Vietnam to give their support to the North Vietnamese's Government.  When she returned to the United States, she advised the news media that all of the American Prisoners of War were being well treated and were not being tortured. <br />As the American POWs returned home in 1973, they spoke out about the inhumane treatment and torture they had suffered as prisoners of war.

North Vietnam was planning a conditional surrender at the Paris Peace Conference. After the North Vietnamese saw how well their allies (Kerry) on the streets of  and the campuses of America, the North Vietnamese decided to fight on.  The efforts of Kerry &amp; Fonda dragged the war on longer causing 20,000 more American boys to die.  Don't believe it?  Use the Internet and you will find the answers. <br />Finally, John Kerry actually went in front of a Senate committee and essentially called American troops in Vietnam - babykillers.  Kerry also lied and said American troops were murdering 200,000 Vietnamese a year.  Kerry provided no evidence to back up these lies.  <br />The North Vietnamese thanked Fonda and Kerry's group for their efforts in saving the communists in Hanoi.

Great title for a work of fiction. A better title would have been \\"Helping My Cronies on Wall Street, So I Can Have Another Mega Paying Gig When I Leave Office.\\"  <br />Mr. Rubin was a co-head of Goldman Sachs when he took the job at Treasury.  His replacement at Goldman was now Democrat Senator John Corzine.  Goldman is currently being sued in a variety of civil cases which occured on Corzine's watch in which Goldman and other investment banks, during the dot bomb era, manipulated Internet stocks on the IPO day.  The firms are accused of trading the shares back and forth to drive Internet stocks from IPO prices of say $15 to $100 on the first day of trading.  The rationale?  To sucker small investors into buying essentially worthless Internet stocks.  The end result was a big Treasury tax receipts in the short term due to a manipulated financial bubble or mania. <br />Rubin at Treasury did not oversee the S.E.C. but was a key member of the Administration supposedly protecting the public from this form of manipulation.  The end result of the dot bomb scam is one of the greatest financial manipulations and fleecing of the public in history. <br />As the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin did have oversight over the IRS.  The IRS during the Clinton Administartion was used to investigate it's political foes while failing to carefully scrutinize the tax returns of companies like Enron, Worldcom, HealthSouth, Global Crossing and other firms or ponzi schemes that costs investors and taxpayers billions. <br />The book fails to mention how the Treasury Secretary with oversight of the IRS failed to deal with Islamic terror groups raising money in the United States.  This is direct responsibility of the Treasury Deaprtment.  The FBI had solid proof in 1992 that Hamas and other Islamic terrorists groups were raising money in the United States.  Janet Reno and the Treasury Department turned a blind eye to their activities. <br />The book fails to mention Rubin's semi-secret Plunge Protection Team or market crash protection scheme used to keep the stock market bubble afloat by buying NASDAQ futures in Asia overnight to keep the U.S. market propped up & tax revenues from stock investments soaring. The plan worked well until 2000, the last year of the Clinton Administration, when the NASDAQ started it's plunge and lost half of it's value.  Rubin was at the helm of one of the largest financial bubbles in global history, which devastated many Americans but it made Clinton look good for a few years.   <br />The book only glosses over Mr. Rubin bailing out large U.S. banks, aka his friends, investments in Mexico, Russia and Asia.  <br />There is also no mention how Mr. Rubin, as the new vice chairman at Citibank making $16.5 million (see Yahoo Finance for Citibank payroll info), called the Bush Administration loking for a bailout for Enron. Citibank had huge loans to the Enron, which was more of a ponzi scheme then corporation.  <br />The Clinton Administration regulalrly went to bat for Enron on their huge India power project and on Ron Brown's \\"trade\\" missions.  One wonders if Mr. Rubin's IRS gave Enron relatively easy reviews while the IRS was giving Mr. Clinton's criticis proctological audits.     <br />In retrospect, Mr. Rubin was probably one of the most corrupt Treasury Secretaries in U.S. history.	2003-12-12

Reagan was often in the wilderness in speaking out against totalitarianism but he never gave up.  <br />If anyone doubts Reagan's belief that communism was evil, they should read Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million by Martin Amis.  Amis book is about the incredible inhumanity of Josef Stalin and how Stalin turned the Soviet Union into hell on earth.  Be prepared to read an incredibly disturbing book.  <br />Meanwhile, buy this book and learn how a very brave man stood against monsters like Stalin.	2003-01-21

Stalin's inhumanity knows no bounds.  Reagan was right when he called the Soviet Union \\"the evil empire.\\"  PResident Reagan was lambasted by the left and others for that statement but he was right.  <br />The stories of the Soviet slaves ships will leave you in tears and numb.  Mr. Amis also details how Stalin transformed the entire state into hell on earth.  <br />The stories of young people murdering older people by suffocation with plastic bags in Camboida under Pol Pot look like a picnic compared to Stalin's Soviet Union. <br />This book also is also a stinging indictment of the left from the 1930s until today.  We have the same type of people today who want to appease tyrants like Saddam, Castro, Kim Jong-Il and others who fawned over Stalin.  One of Stalin's lackeys included folk singer Pete Seeger who was awarded a medal for his good \\"works\\" a few years ago by Bill Clinton. <br />Buy this book but be prepared to reading some of the most distrurbing books you will ever read.	2003-01-21

Dr. Savage points out how the left wants to destroy America.  If you think he is wrong just look at California.  The state is $35 billion in the hole and illegal aliens continue to flood into the state (as well as the rest of America).<br />Savage also points out how 9-11 and the sniper case where 10 people were murdered is directly related to our open borders.  We have now found out that the shooter in the sniper case was illegal alien & Jamacian John Malvo. <br />Sadly, the Republican Party (RNC) is almost as bad as the evil Democrats in allowing the borders to remain wide open.

Savage tells it like it is, which makes a lot of people uncomfortable.

Maher is a lefty stooge who spends some of his time hanging out at the Playboy mansion with Hef.  The good news is Hef's \\"empire\\" is losing money hand over fist so Maher will eventually have to go out and find his own whores.   <br />Maher constantly parroted the Democratic Party line on his incredibly lame TV show. This book is another DNC cut & paste job.  Maher fails to address the Clinton open border policy & the uncontrolled immigration policies which was a primary cause of 9-11. <br />Mr. Atta, 9-11 terrorist leader, laughed at the joke security & INS polocies at Miami airport.  During the same period of time, the Clinton's INS devoted a huge amount of resources to catch Elian Gonzalez.  Meanwhile, Atta was slipping in and out of the U.S. through Miami airport & laughing his head off. <br />In addition, Maher fails to address why Clinton failed to do anything after we were bombed 6 times and ambushed once by Al Qeada. Clinton sent Louis Freeh's corrupt FBI to investigate and did nothing else. Clinton felt bombing Kosovo for 70 days would get Monica off the front page.  Tackling Al Qeada or a real threat might hurt Clinton poll numbers.<br />Bill Maher never addresses why 9-11 & Bin Laden happened, he just make more excuses for Bill Clinton and blames SUV drivers. <br />Avoid this garbage.  Maher proves in his tome that he really is a sleazy character.	2003-01-02

A book about him mentions how he supposedly would tell Maria B on CNBC little news tips and news \\"sccops.\\" She would parrot them and he would sell on the news. <br />He also loved Internet stocks and was pumping Martho Steward's stock after the news came out about her insider trading. The stock then tanked. Avoid this guy. Why Kudlow does a show with him is beyond me.	2002-12-21

The scam sucked the little guys in on IPO date when the shares were traded by investment banks and hedge funds to the moon.  The whole thing was bogus. Where were you Mr. Levitt and your predecessor Mr. Waldman during Clinton's reign of terror?  Playing golf? Giving lectures? <br />What nerve.  Millions of small investors got hosed on your watch and you have the nerve to publish this drivel.  Nothing changes on Wall Street.  Always a scam going to screw the little guy.	2002-12-15

The borders are still wide open	Ms. Malkin does an excellent job explaining why the United States will be attacked again and why our way of life faces a serious threat.  The muslim terrorists 9-11 attack not only killed thousands but did serious damage to the U.S. economy.  If you doubt it ask the 100,000 + people who lost their job in the airline, travel, hospitality and aviation industry.  The next time could be a lot worse. <br />How did it happen?  Wide open borders during Bill Clinton and political correctness.  President Bush still has not taken the steps necessary to protect our borders.  Ms. Malkin has warned us, will we listen?	2002-12-15

The review mentioned photos of same sex couples but their were only a few and no nudes.  I hope I can get my money back.<br />I do think Al and Tipper have a point that, in the future, more American families will look more like the Michael Jackson household.  We will see more diversity with same sex parents, transgendered parents and interracial transgendered parents too.  The future looks bright but it just did not come out in this book which is a real shame.	2002-11-27

Maraniss failed to do his homework because many people in Tenn loathe Gore. I was hoping the author would go into whether Gore's father was a member of the Klu Klux Klan but this appears to have been whitewashed this dirty little secret.<br />Gore could have done something about terrorism (six Islamic bombings during his VP) but Al was in the bathroom after drinking to much tea at illegal fundraisers.	2002-11-27

Nothing has changed since 9-11 and the terrorists can come and go as they please. <br />Sadly it is probably too late to do anything. Read the book and understand. We already have let the invaders in and the intolerance of \\"tolerance\\" will be the final straw. A friend of mine works in a government agency and they are worried about what the terrorist will do next.	2002-09-24

He tarnishes the good name of men who actually fought and died in Vietnam.  Disgraceful. Avoid anything written by this man.	2001-06-21
