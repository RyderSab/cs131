While N.T. Wright is the contributor that I knew I would side with more in this particular debate, I did not think that Borg would be what he is. By that I mean that he is no J.D. Crossan laying down ideas and giving me no way or reason to join him. My overall impression is that Borg stops just short of being quite a bit like Wright. Both men share a Jesus who subverts authority and liberates but Borg's is really nothing more than that. I gave this book five stars becuase it is, as other reviewers have said, a very good introduction to the debate. Futhermore, both men can write well, which is refreshing. I simply feel that Borg had the burden of proof (since I've already read some of Wirght's work) and he did not sway me. But he did inform me, which is honestly well worth the price of the book.	2005-05-12

But this is an intriguing set of essays. Stanley Hauerwas approaches many issues from a totally different perspective than the world around him. Unlike many western Christians Hauerwas does not look at social issues in term of rights; for example abortion. Hauerwas does not qualify his remarks on abortion in terms of right to life, right to one's body, etc. instead Hauerwas' view of life is that it is a gift of God that we should not address as a right because rights are ostensibly legal entitlements. This does seem to be a Biblical perspective on the issue, at least it is in my opinion. That not withstanding Hauerwas makes little use of scripture in these essays. Something I find rather disturbing. As a Christian I want to see ethics spelled out in scripture because that's the bread and butter of my faith. This is the only major shortcoming I can readily identify in the way he addresses things. Overall I would recommend this work to any Christian would wishes to reflect on social issues in a way that does not require them to play ball with the world at large.	2005-02-04

All Moore is really doing is identifying an emerging consensus between Covenantal and Dispensational theologians. That seems to over-simplify American evangelical theology by quite a bit. Eschatologically one would think that there are only two views representative of America's evangelicals. This is not the case. Moore really only gives credence to Amillennialism and Dispensationalism (and he really only discusses Progressive Dispensatiolism). While academically Progressive Dispensationalism may be gaining ground but it is a far different than the brand you'll find in most evangelical bookstores. And Amillennialism is probably as popular among Covenentalists as is Postmillennialism, so why is the only recognition of Postmillennialism that it exists. This book is barren as a real assessment of where American evangelicals are going. I see absolutely no reason to believe that an academic consensus will have much of an effect on the majority of evangelicals. In fact it seems that most Christians in America are moving away from theology and have been for decades despite the fact that so much ground is being broken at the scholastic level. I will say this of Moore's work here; it is informative. But being informed of a movement that really has had almost no effect on the majority of America's evangelicals and their churches is a waste in my opinion. The true task should not be to make Covenantal theology look more like Dispensational and vice verse but instead to foster a greater appreciation in the hearts and minds of layman and pastors for the study and truth of God.<br /><br />It also seems to me that this work is a little too skewed in the direction of Dispensational theology. It's not really and explicit thing but it's something that did trouble me slightly as I read this work. I'm also not sure that Moore ever quantifies his acceptance of many of these concessions made between the respective views. Why does he so willingly claim that these are positive steps? Again though I must say that I found this work to be informative. I am relatively young and I was truly unaware that many of these concessions were ever problematic. I was introduced to Amillenialism by Hoekema. And Progressive Dispensationalism is really about my age.Why does he so willingly claim that these are positive steps?

I picked this novel up hoping that it would prove to be a bit less morose in the end than the two works by Blair that I'd read just prior to it (Animal Farm and 1984). It was not. It's the same desparity and coldness that Orwell sees in the real world. This novel is not about characters in Burma. It's about people being forgotten, used, trampled, marginalized and discarded. Racial and ethnic superiority are the least of our problems. Narcisism and solipcism are the most obvious causes of the events in this novel. Flory is a scared man who does not fully realize the potential he has and pays for his timidity. All-in-all this is a terrific novel that I would recommend to anyone looking for a strong substantial book to read.	2004-09-09

Benniof's characters were more musing and thoughtful than they were complex. There wasn't much of a conflict for the Monty especially. He was so aloof it was disturbing. I didn't feel that he was tortured enough. I didn't even get the sense that he was really all that cool, which is the impression it seems Benniof wants to give. Monty just seems lazy and detatched from the lives of everyone around him. While there are refernces to things that seem to have had an impact on his life in huge ways (e.g. his father's being an alchoholic) these things just seem to be filler to keep the story moving another few inches. This is not a terrible book though. It's just not outstanding.	2004-08-21

This was indeed like nothing I'd ever seen before when I first read it because I wasa used to reading the very broad and uninformative history editions that we used in school. Howard Zinn did a very good job of presenting the way things truly were, are and probably always will be. Which, while depressing, is nice to read when all you're used to is the typical BS that historians feed people. Even the liberal, it seems, are not exempt from Zinn's wrath. Presidents Roosevelt and Clinton seem to bear the brunt of the critcism, or at least those are the two chapters that stick out to me the most. It seems that Zinn holds the left up to a higher standard than he would say Presidnet Reagan or George Walker Bush. This is probably because both men are creditted with revolutions that never happened. Neither really eworked to promote the cause of peace and neither, in Zinn's opinion, did enough for the widowed, orphaned, indigent or just plain poor people in the United States. I would certainly recomment this work to anyone who is capable of reading other books as well. Everything that happens in this book happened in reality but there is certainly a perspective to much of the presentation. Be careful and make up you own mind.	2004-08-21
US	38948667	RG70SCMTJXJCA	0060929871	949556910	Brave New World	Books	4	1	1	N	N	AAhh	When I first read this book I loved it for its content and social commentary. But in all honesty, this is not an outstanding literary work. Huxley's writing is very superficial. I don't mean that in any pejorative way either, it's simply that his novels are about written to be about what they're about. That may not make too much, let me elaborate. Essentially what Brave New World is, is Huxley's essays in novel form. Now these are tremendous essays with a lot of thought and applicability to reality. But when this work is compared to 1984, a work that is not only writtened to be about something but could exist on its own simply for the skill that Blair has with prose, Brave New World is lacking. The characters are probably the baest example of this. In 1984 Winston is a very complex character who has quite a hard time with himself because he is too weak fight Ingsoc and too ignorant to articulate his feelings. While somehow Bernard is quite articulate but only for the sake of his being a Freudean model. Winston's problem is something that people truly experience. Not being able to argue with a \\"superior\\" figure because the esoteric feelings they have are adequate to convince them of something but to languid to effect someone prepared for the arguments. That isn't the only problem I have with this novel but I haven't got the time to go on.	2004-08-17

I was still, very much, in the infant stages of my faith and was very eager to attend whatever Bible studies were available to me. I went to one on a Monday night and the topic of discussion was predestination. I had absolutely no view and little interst in the subject at the time. I was totally ignorant of the ins-and-outs of any point in the debate. As the discussion went on an intern suggested that maybe God had deliberately limited his knowledge of the future to make our choices truly free. It didn't sound right to me-but who was I to question?  <br /> <br />This work exposes the very poisoness presence of such thinking in the church. Namely that oour liberty and autonomy are tantamount to God's being good. That we must form for ourselves from clay a god who suits our desires. This notion is not merely a harmless suggestion to be shrugged off in hopes that it will be abandoned at some later point when mislead christians see the error behind it on there own. No, this is an heresy that must attacked more vehemently than Arianism, Gnosticism, Euticheanism, etc. Why is this heresy so much greater than the rest? It isn't. But the times in which we live are the soil from which this lunacy has sprung. This is not merely some handful of clerics and scholars gone astray. Open theism's very heart is the idea that liberty is the utmost goal in any arena, even God's. Dr. Piper and company have each contributed resounding calls not to laymen, pastors or seminary professors alone. The call goes out to all. It starts with the educators then to their students (the clergy) then to deacons and elders and most importantly to the men and women who fill churches all over the world. The church should never be lazy with orthodoxy. But the fact that even the identity of our God is in danger of being taken from us we must be ever vigilent to pursue and broadcast the light of God's sovreignty to all who are near us. I know I haven't made too much comment on the book itself, so let me jst say: read this book and share it in the first Bible study you attend. Do not let heresy cloak itslef in the shadows of your church.	2004-08-17

I just don't see that much interaction between the three authors. Also, the fact that there were only three authors is problematic. Not having separate sections for Historic and Dispensational Premillenialism will certainly effect a work like this negatively. To have a Dispensationalist speak for an Historic Premillenialist ir vice versa will leave one of the views with poor representation because the presenter has no vested interst in that viewpoint (and is in fact an opponent, causing their presentation to intentionally be weak). This is certainly not the book that you want to use in a discipleship group or study. THe presentations are too weak. The way that each author approaches the discussion is far from forceful, which I feel it should be. I would suggest Meaning of the Millenium instead. But I could be wrong since there are people who've rated this work higher than the four-point. So check it out if you'd like.	2004-08-06

When I first read this novel I liked it but thought that it could have been better. I think much of my thining was caused by Brave New World. But the more research I did into this work and Blair himself lead me to believe that he was right-on. The type of totalitarianism that he was addressing were despotic. I found it odd though that Blair seemed to demonstrate the Marxist system in such a bad light. But it seems that if one looks at his commentary in the light in which it was written one sees that he was not addressing Marxism but Bolshevism (or Sovietism) and Nazism. These were not the happy pleasant dystoipias that one finds in Huxley. Also the issues that Blair was addressing were different from those that are normally thought of, especially in the cse of Huxley. Blair is addressing humanity and the abstracts that go with it while Huxley is looking at aspects of Western culture (e.g. drugs, technology, education and higherarchical class structure). It's true that many of the same issues are dealt with in both works but Huxley still comes to happier conclusions, disturbing as they may be. The reason for this seems to be that Huxley's world was the precursor to Blair's. The war had not yet begun. The socialist experiments in Germany and the Soviet Union had not yet failed. The Spanish revolution had not yet begun. While the world was not perfect it was much easier to be ignorant about the many evils of the world and assume that the only ills that the world could bring were held in the deterioration that over-indulgance would yield. While both are accurate Blair had a lot more information to work with.	2004-07-30

The main character, Yosarean, is compelled after months of being put into the line of fire to stop. He no longer wants to follow the orders of his superiors who have no-one's interst but their own at heart. (This is best articulated by Colonel Cathcart, who longs to be featured in the Saturday Evening Post.) Yosarean's solution is to not go into harm's way any longer. Most of the novel is rapturously funny with characters who never answer a question with a satisfactory response. But toward the end the tone becomes dark and quite disturbing as Yosarean becomes more and more haunted by the memories of his fallen comrades, which amounts to nearly all of them. All-in-all this is most certainly a work that I would recommend to anyone looking for a laugh. But be prepared for an intensely dismaying end.	2004-07-23

Usually when I read tha various citations of critics on the back of a novel they're way off. But in the case of Cacciato they couldn't have been more correct. Tim O'brien packaged the dreams and hopes of anyone living in an irrepressably miserable situation. I was a bit disapointed with the ultimate outcome of the novel but, as one reviewer here so aptly stated, his prose is excellent. I can't think of any other novels that make me pine to see the places within them. The colors, sensations and experiences are absolutely vivid. This is a must read for anyone.

Neither James White nor Dave Hunt do a particularly note worthy job in this debate. I feel that this may be the direct result of the word limit in White's case but Hunt seems to know very little about the issue at hand. Dave Hunt's presentations and rebuttals were childish at their best. He never addresses the issues raised by White but instead continues to repeat the same things that he has said in reference to calvinism. This work does not bring me to the conclusion that Hunt is well versed in this issuse but is instead someone who has picked up a new hobby. White on the other hand deals with what he actually does address with style and care, as is to be expected of a man of his intelligence. The biggest problem in this book though is that White allows many of Hunt's claims go unaddressed which is terrible in a debate and were Hunt actually paying attention to what White is saying instead of mis-representing calvinists by paraphrasing with elipses, White would not have done nearly as well as he did. I like this book because I think that it shows not simply the intellectual divide between White and Hunt but demonstrates (this may be a stretch) the desire of calvinists to do real and complete exegesis in opposition to many semi-palageans who simply proof-text and ignore greater scriptural contexts.	2004-06-15

I feel that he has met his goal. Verkler addresses the issues that are typically involved in hermeneutics; history of Biblical interpretation, lexical/syntactical elements, theological models, etc. But he makes it clear that application of scripture is ultimately the purpose of hermeneutics and ultimately his goal in this work. This is a very easy to understand, basic treatment of hermeneutics that will aid in further study.

I never thought I'd hear anyone excuse the emptiness of the Kings, Rices, Grishams, etc. but Meyers' did just that. He represents the pretensious and inexplicably flawed writing of today's 'literary' authors as just what it is. Hard to read Bool-sheet. The part of this book that I absolutely love the most that Meyers calls a spade a spade and says that if it's hard to read that's probably because it's poorly written. It seems unfair that contemporary critics would allow someone to feel stupid simply because they don't like garbage. <br />Literature isn't as subjective as some would believe. It consists not simply of words but of good utilization of those words. Anyone could slap a bunch of words on a few pages and expect people to like it. The rel issue is that people need to at least try nd distinguish between novels that seem to be words vomitted onto a paged helter skelter and words used to crft a novel out of scattered words and blank pages.
