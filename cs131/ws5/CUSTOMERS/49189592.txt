I too approached this book with a similar impression of it, though it was surprisingly ranked at number 42 on top-100 list.  Unfortunately, the excellence of Dickey's work is lost in the constant and chronic referencing to that one scene.  This story is about man's search for self-identity, self-awareness, and acceptance.  The story is told from the perspective of Ed Gentry, one of four men to embark on a whitewater river adventure.  Ed's frame of reference on this trip is primarily defined by his athletic friend Lewis.  Ed compares himself and the other members of the group to Lewis as he looks to find himself in a bit of a mid-life crisis.  Ultimately, Ed finds his validation in his ability to push himself beyond what he previously thought possible.   Dickey manages to generate some interesting insight into the human psyche within the context of a plot that is as exciting as anything I've read.  The descriptions of the river and the challenges the four men face are well done enough to get you there.  The plot has several sections where it almost becomes a page-turner rather than a brooding, introspective classical novel like much of the other selections on the top-100 list.  I liked this book because it was an exciting story that was far more deeply written than most adventure novels.	2004-06-29
US	49189592	R3LITW8W4MHA0Y	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fantastic	This book was rated number 41 on the Modern Library's top 100 list, though after reading it I felt it should have been rated higher.  On the surface, this is a simplistic story and a rather short one at 200 pages.  What is brilliant about this book, however, is Golding's ability to craft a powerful and timeless statement about humanity and mankind.  His prose is concise and focused, yet his ability to paint a picture of castaway life on a tropical island is every bit as good as much longer tomes.  I found the breakdown of civilized values played out on a beautiful tropical island to be a terrific dichotomy.  The interplay between the English school boys and the brutal reality of survival on an island provided numerous intersections in a brilliantly interwoven plot.  The end result is a rather haunting reminiscence of this story after you've finished reading it.  This is similar to Robinson Crusoe or The Count of Monte Cristo in that they are all stories we know.  Yet, going back and reading them again as an adult brings new worlds of meaning and perspective along with perhaps a new-found appreciation for why they are timeless stories to begin with.	2004-06-27

It didn't this time.  This book is impressive on many levels.  Steinbeck has captured the reality of life in America during the Depression like few others.  In doing so, he has also captured a snapshot of America that is both poignant and enlightening.  The greatest works of art and literature transcend themselves beyond the immediate and become timeless and that is very much the case here.  Most readers will find they have little in common with the Joad family and yet Steinbeck portrays the human side of an Oklahoma family so well that most every reader can relate to them.  Steinbeck's brilliance is apparent in his ability to portray and to relate the human condition.  It is also apparent in creating a work of vision that is both immense in scope and finite in detail.  Oddly, in a tragic story largely full of despair, Steinbeck still manages to communicate a sense of optimism and hope for our society.  This book is worth reading more than once and I have to agree with its rating in the top 10 of the century.	2004-06-27
US	49189592	R2HDQWGNRCQTJN	0451518829	990924494	Sons and Lovers	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Sons and Lovers	This work by D.H. Lawrence was rated number 9 on the top 100 list, and I think it's a fair rating.  Sons and Lovers is a beautifully written and intricately drawn story of a young man.  This actually serves as a pseudo autobiography as it mirrors DHL's life rather closely.  There is a quality to this work that you do not find in contemporary novels.  The characters are developed to an incredible depth and with great skill and precision.  You find after reading this book that you feel you know some of the characters better than your neighbors.  This is not a book about action or drama, it is about life.  The focus here is not on the storyline, but on the people involved in it.  As opposed to today's authors, Lawrence uses the storyline to define the character and personality of the participants.  I think this book is so well written that it can make you look at your own friends and family and understand how little you really know of them.  Many scholars talk about the idea of Lawrence introducing the Oedipal complex, but it's not really what this book is all about.  While that psychiatrical phenomenon is a component of this work, the defining quality of this work is really about Lawrence's ability to capture the people in his story as eloquently and with such detail as he has.  If you can appreciate good literature, this book is a must read for you.	2004-06-19

In style, this novel is similar to some of Faulkner's work in that much of the text is extremely first-person.  That is, Rhys gets so dialed-in to the character that the perception of events and interactions blurs and at times is hard to follow.  Also, the first-person perspective shifts subtley from one character to the other.  Much like Faulkner, the reader has to glean that the narration is from another character's perspective.  As such, this is not a novel to breeze through, but rather one that you have to absorb.  The words and the characters seem to sink in over time.  It has an ephemeral quality that may have something to do with the Caribbean setting.  The literatti love that Rhys took the character from Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the \\"mad woman in the attic\\" and brought her to life.  I, however, found that the strongest aspect of this work was the Faulkner-esque writing style, which transposed nicely with the Jamaican tropics.  Rhys gives you a sense of life in the Caribbean, of its politics, its rhythyms, and its joys and despairs.  The disjointed and transposed first-person perspective created an intense sense of the insanity of the woman against a backdrop of politics and socio-economic tension.  The descent into madness of the main character, Annette Cosway, was confusing at times, but emblematic of Rhys' effort here.  This is especially true at the end of the novel when the setting shifts to England and the once beautiful heiress has been transformed into the mad woman in the attic.	2004-05-04

That being said, Jimmy Carter is a fascinating individual, much lauded and awarded, and deservedly so.  His book, The Hornets Nest, is an admirable effort, but it reads like a confused text book.  The storyline and dialog are average, though the subject matter is interesting.  Compared to other books in this genre, Carter's book struggles for stature.  Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, and Robinson Crusoe were some of the original historical novels and are much stronger in many aspects.  I don't think Carter was trying to write the next Rob Roy, however.  I think he accomplished basically what he set out to do, which was to write a book that taught people about the Revolutionary War without being a textbook.  I think he actually could have written two books with the material he has in this one.  He easily has enough material and research to have written a non-fiction book about the Southern perspective on the Revolutionary War.  I think he could have taken the fictional storyline and dialog from this book and written another about the psyche and psychological dichotomy of life thrown into war and the choices and decisions one has to make as an individual.  If you have an interest in this time in history, you will find this a worthwhile read.  For all its faults, this book is still very well researched and full of information about how the state of Georgia came to be.  The role of the southern States in the Revolutionary War is much less well-known that that of the northern States and the stories of George Washington and Cornwallis.  If you enjoy politics and history, you will likely enjoy this book much more than the average reader.  If these subjects are not your cup of tea, you are probably best served to look elsewhere.	2004-05-04

What most don't know is that the story is about much more than simply being shipwrecked.  It's about man's view on God and his place in the universe and his faith in himself.  RC is a good book, though I think a bit laborious.  I think that the movie &quot;Castaway&quot; with Tom Hanks has conditioned us to think of shipwreck stories lasting only a few years.  This story lasts 26 years and is, as a result, very elaborate.  I found it interesting to see how the author delved so deeply in the main character's religious beliefs and how they so strongly impacted his thoughts and actions.  The book did have a bit too much of a feel good aspect to it in that things were either going very well or very poorly for the castaway, though I think that is somewhat symptomatic of the time it was written in.  The work is perhaps more impressive when you consider that it was basically illegal to write this kind of story back then.  It had to be written from the first person perspective, almost as an historical or autobiographical piece in order for Defoe to get it published.  To that end, this was truly one of the first of the novels in the historical genre that was later followed by Sir Walter Scott who wrote Ivanhoe and Rob Roy, among others.	2004-04-08
US	49189592	R2MCFD7T2ZHECM	0553265954	881120122	Darkness at Noon	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Fantastic	Darkness at Noon is ranked 8 on the top-100 list of books (past century) by the New York Library and I can now see why.  This novel has a very simple story line about the imprisonment of a political figure in 1930's Soviet Union.  The perspective with which the protagonist approaches his situation and the personal philosophies he employs to deal with his situation are impressive.  Koestler dials into the character's mind and paints a picture that is at once complex and yet understandable.  His ability to put you into this persons shoes (so to speak) make you feel as though you are there.  You understand the reasoning behind his actions and comments.  The way that he interacts with the world around him becomes understandable if not almost familiar and you end up feeling as though you have known Nicholas Salmonavitch.  This story does not demonize the Soviet Union, it's government or its people in the tumultuous political climate of the 1930's, but rather portrays it simply as it was.  Koestler's command and grasp of writing are similar to Hemingway in that he creates a powerful and meaningful story without a lot of flowery prose or a vocabulary that has you running to the dictionary every five minutes.  I found this novel to be as impressive and well-written as anything by Joyce, Faulkner, Huxley, etc. if not more (for me) more fun to read.  I found the style to be similar to Nabokov and Konrad, both of whom I also enjoy reading.	2004-04-03

The book takes you through someone's life using a trip to Heaven after their recent death as the vehicle to introduce you to the characters and events.  You either like Albom's writing style and abilities or you do not.  It's not for everyone (as with many popular books, the reviews on this are all over the place).  His work is analogous with the Hallmark or Disney Channels on tv.  It's a bit schlocky and designed to pull at the heart-strings, but it's well-written for what it is.  If you are willing to use this book to get you to look at yourself and your life from another perspective, you will find value in it.  If you are simply looking for a good story, you will likely be disappointed.	2004-04-03

In fact, he does so good a job, that many actually come away from this story with the belief that they've also read an analysis on historical documents and events (they have not).  The plot revolves around solving a murder in the Louvre that takes the protagonist on a journey around France and London, solving clues and learning about secret religious orders in pursuit of the location of the holy grail.  DaVinci Code elevates the concept of action novel to a new level.  It will get most readers to think about religions in a new way and it will potentially change the way we look at the impact of religions on the world we live by showing us the possibilities.  But let's not get carried away.  This is an exciting, well-written novel, and (for page-turning, make you think about new possibilities, well-done thinking person's action), it is on a par with Michael Crichton, Anne Rice, and others.  This book came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  Just make sure you don't try to come off like some kind of expert on religion when you're done.  Some of the concepts Brown uses to put his story together are highly disputed and not necessarily subject to verification.	2004-04-03
US	49189592	R1OHN8QYXTWQJR	0679745580	990777880	In Cold Blood	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Capote's New Genre	I liked this book, I'm just not sure I really loved it.  Capote does get you into the story, the event of the murder of the Clutter family and he does it very well.  His work on this novel defined a new genre of \\"real-life fiction\\" and we hear the common refrain before many of today's tv shows, \\"based on real life events\\" and we can thank Capote for much of this.  However, I can't help but wonder if this story is not as timeless as Capote had initially imagined.  In a day and age where horrific murder is reported daily or at least weekly on multiple news channels, Capote's book lacks the timeless essence his other work is known for and as a result, lacks that dramatic punch that it must have had in the 60s and 70s.  I also found that once I read \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and several of his other short stories, (for which he was much heralded), I had a different take on the book.  In retrospect, I noticed a much more liberal slant to Perry and Dick, the two murderers in the novel than I did when I first read their story.  Capote is very forgiving of his character's faults in his stories and this becomes much more apparent in \\"In Cold Blood\\" if you are already familiar with his work.  Capote is a one of the most well respected authors of the last century, but if you want a feel for his work, read some of his short stories before getting into his most well-known novel.	2004-03-13

Rice does a good job with an exciting story-line, which is usually the strongest part of her work.  Her character development struggles a little bit in this book as with the rest of her recent work.  The main character struggles with his sexuality and the homo-erotic prose is stronger in this book than in her other works.  Lestat, usually the star, is only part of the backdrop and not seemingly himself.  He is understanding, open with his feelings, and overly supportive.  The whole book had a \\"too good to be true\\" aspect to it that detracted from an otherwise gripping storyline.  Everything the teenage main character tried to do worked, despite the odds, and it seemed to be presented in a flippant and casual manner.  This gave the book a slapstick overtone that was never present in the original Vampire Chronicles.  In those works, the characters struggled mightily with their obstacles and challenges and success was never a certainty.  In this work, the characters and the challenges they face in life are simply too shallow.  In essence, Rice's story was so good that it worked in spite of her recent drop in quality.	2004-03-13

There is more to this case than is traditionally associated with the name Jack the Ripper and Cornwell puts it forward brilliantly.  She delves into not just the results of the use of the latest forensic science, but into the social mores and customs of the time period.  She explains how the formation of the London Police Dept and Scotland Yard only a few years before the murders actually made it easy for the killer as well as encouraged the police and media to dis-associate other murder victims to the case.  She also discusses the results of attempts to link the suspected individual and the evidence from Jack the Ripper using DNA samples collected from envelopes and stamps from the actual evidence files at Scotland Yard.  Cornwell paints a fascinating portrait of the Ripper murders and her background as a forensic scientist gives an accurate an assessment of the identity of Jack the Ripper as anyone can with modern technology.  If these subject matter appeals to you (if you like Discovery Channel's shows on forensic science and CSI, etc) you will really enjoy this book.	2004-02-04

In my quest to read the top 100 fiction books of the last century, I picked up what is probably Kafka's seminal work. (this was listed at number 92)  I found this book to be a somewhat poignant discussion of how our society judges people, how perception is reality, and how in life, you rarely get a fair trial.  I also saw Kafka's work as unique and unlike any of the other books I've read on the top 100 list.  Kafka's style is straight-forward and concise and his sentences are packed with meaning.  There really isn't a lot of superfluous verbiage or flowery, overly-descriptive prose.  As with most of the classics, this book is worthwhile if you're looking to get something out of it beyond the storyline.	2004-01-24

Miller's work is existential and to that end it is one of the best works I've read.  He lets the reader into his head in a surreal stream of conscious dialog.  This book is a classic and has a place in contemporary literature because of Miller's ability to challenge established thought and censorship.  For that alone this book is worth reading.  Without the liberal use of the &quot;c-word&quot; this book is relatively unoffensive or at least unlikely to be banned.  His use of that word in particular is both its hallmark and its least impressive quality.  His use of it will challenge the reader, perhaps to be open minded, perhaps as a screen against the prudes and narrow-minded readers of the world.  His work is similar to Kerouac in that you have someone able to capture their search for meaning in life.  Miller delves into the subject far more deeply than Kerouac.  Kerouac's search led him to travel across the US, while Miller's search was to a far greater extent internal.  Although he travelled across the Atlantic, he really didn't explore Europe the way Kerouac explored the US.  Although Miller's novel is set in 1930s Paris and Montparnasse, it really isn't a novel about Paris or even France.  Rather, it's about Miller's ability to capture his thoughts and understandings seemingly as they occur to him.  You get the impression that these thoughts are fleeting as they are woven into the story and as a result they become much more eloquent.	2004-01-06

I had heard from a number of people that Cold Mountain was the best book of the Civil War genre since Killer Angels and one of the reviews in the book jacket for Cold Mountain comments similarly.  I'm not a Civil War fan or a history buff and yet I was very much moved by what I read.  If you don't like history or the Civil War as a subject, do not let it put you off from reading this book.  Shaara brings the story to life so well and with such facility that you become engrossed in the novel.  He almost supercedes the subject itself.  Its a shame he hasn't written more 'historical novels'.  His ability to put you into the perspective and the minds of the Generals and Officers involved in the conflict is second to none.  Sir Walter Scott was the originator of the historical novel genre, but I haven't read anyone as good as Shaara.  I can understand now why it won a Pulitzer and I would certainly expect that 100 or 200 years from people will view Shaara's work with the same reverence they view the classic novels now.  Every once in a while you read a book that simply moves you as a person, that changes your perspective and your understanding of the world around you.  This is one of those books.	2003-12-20

This monster was not actually called Frankenstein, it was not slow and lumbering, it was not stupid or incapable of speech.  While the literary critics have been historically slow to warm to this novel, it is a work of substantive quality and structure.  It also conveys a powerful message about good versus evil, vanity, and personal responsibility.  This novel is really, in a lot of ways, more than a horror story, its about how people view themselves and those around them.  There is much debate (in literary circles) around whether or not Mary Shelley actually wrote the novel of her own accord or whether she had a good deal of help.  I would suggest the paucity of anything else even remotely in the class of Frankenstein would lead one to certain suspicions.	2003-12-06

Having read Moby Dick, I was prepared for a complicated and somewhat dissolute read with great symbolism.  Typee is none of that, though it has elements of the style that would, through Moby Dick make Melville post-humously famous.  Written today, this book would not be a hit, though one can see why it was when it was published in the 1800s.  The symbolism in Typee is not as substantive or immediately obvious as in MD, but it is present and gives this work more depth than is at first apparent.  I don't know that I have an accurate sense of what Melville is all about after reading this and MD, and I would probably recommend one read Billy Budd or at least another novel in order to really get a feel for Melville.	2003-12-06

His work is everything you're looking for and yet the story is unpredictable enough to keep you reading and turning the pages.  Like most characters in this genre of books, Bosch's life is written out as a chronology.  In this novel he's now retired and he does reflect back, if briefly, on some of the previous cases we all read about.  Its an appealing element to the Bosch series in that you find yourself relating to the character, almost as if you can imagine getting to know them.  If you like Connelly, you'll probably find that this is one of his best works.  You can see his continued growth as a writer and his works generally continue to get better and are more polished.  Connelly shows again that he's one of the most gifted writers in this genre.  All in all, another great read.	2003-12-06

Much like Marquez's other work, he paints pictures and concepts in fragments of time, glimpses of memories and remembrances, and pieces of his characters personalities.  The perspective and narration shift, sometimes intangibly and in mid-sentence.  The effect is mosaic and powerful.  He eloquently captures the essence of dictatorships and abuse and distortion of power from a distinctively non-Western perspective.  The character in this novel is a composite of multiple Latin American dictators, written in the fantastic and surreal style that is Marquez and is similar to Rushdie.	2003-09-25

The story was believable enough to keep you on the edge and fantastic enough to keep you turning the pages.  I will be surprised if it doesn't win the Booker Prize, though I'm not sure this one is destined to be one of the all-time classics.  It gives the reader a lot to think about, much like the movie or storyline from &quot;Castaway&quot;.  It keeps the reader wondering how they themselves could and would react if pushed to the absolute limits like Pi in this story.  I find myself recalling scenes and situations from the book and it certainly does have that haunting quality.  You'll find this one on a lot of book-club lists for the simple reason that it actually does a reasonably good job of living up to the hype it gets.	2003-09-25

The people and places are surreal and distorted, yet familiar at the same time.  In a lot of ways, its similar to the distorted vision from which we view the world as children, where everything seems larger than life and more important than it really is.  I've read articles where Marquez and Rushdie's writing styles have been favorably compared before and if you've read one, the similarities will become immediately apparent upon reading the other.  Rushdie has done a fantastic job of telling a story with a political message that doesn't really feel like a political message because it was so masterfully told.  Like most good books, this is one you find yourself remembering for a while.	2003-09-04

Most of the reviews for this book are glowing and for good reason.  GGM's writing style is unusual, perhaps reminiscent of Carlos Castenada and also Rushdie.  Marquez uses the events and emotions of his generally shallow characters to paint a picture of human emotion and struggle.  The characters are painted almost in composite rather than as a picture.  Details are used not to create a complete portrait of the character or of the town but to set a mood and convey almost intangible concepts.  Appreciating this work is perhaps a little like appreciating Salvador Dali's paintings.  The events that occur in the town are fantastic and surreal by design.  Taken at face value, the book is almost nonsensical.  Read and understood perhaps more as art, as an attempt to paint a picture, the book is haunting, moving, and evocative.  This is definitely one work of literature that will stretch your boundaries and stands up to any of the classics.	2003-09-04

Like FC and Pulp Fiction, among others, this book challenges your perception of society.  It challenges the way you see yourself and it makes you laugh at the same time.  It is dark in its humor and punishing in its frank assessment of the state of our society.  Although its not really one of the all-time classics, it is rapidly becoming a cult classic.  You have to appreciate this genre to appreciate Palahniuk and therefore this book.	2003-08-30
US	49189592	R35PZ5OUODA8Z6	0812565657	259828480	Ivanhoe (Tor Classics)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Ivanhoe	Ivanhoe is a continuation of the work of Sir Walter Scott as regards his historical novels.  Scott was one of the first to create the concept of a historical novel and to this day, his ability to accurately capture and convey the historical time period in which his stories were set is impressive.  If you have already read Rob Roy, this will be an easier read for you.  It has less of the colloquialisms and true Scottish language and therefore you find yourself translating less and enjoying the story more.  This book is perhaps better appreciated when it is read amongst other Scott works, including Rob Roy.  It is a classic and it reads like one.  The storyline isn't terribly complicated but the characters can be difficult to follow from time to time as they have multiple names and (for some), their true identities are revealed later in the novel.  As with Rob Roy, you actually do end up learning a bit about what life was like for many people in that era, which I found perhaps most interesting about the book.	2003-08-30

While it was enjoyable, it would have been easier to appreciate if I had read Ivanhoe first.  Rob Roy is a difficult book to read and it does require some patience.  The Scottish language and customs can be difficult to get through and it does start a bit slow.  If you have already read Ivanhoe, this will be a bit more challenging, but definitely worthwhile.  Once you get into it and the action picks up a bit and the characters have all been established, it flows much more quickly.  Scott's work seems to have a pattern of establishing the characters and setting first and extensively before getting into the flow of the plot.  I think this makes his books slow to get into but ultimately fun to finish.	2003-08-30

I don't know that this book was particularly well written as he really did little more than aggregate a lot of (often, not always) interesting interviews.  I'm not sure the book is still contemporary and I do feel that race relations have come a good ways along since this book was written.  That being said, I do think this book is very worthwhile for most anyone, even today.  While it was very interesting to gain insight into minority views on the Reagan administration, Farrakhan, etc., I think I honestly gained more from the every day stories and perspectives that were related.  It will certainly get you to think about race relations from an entirely new perspective and that is far and away its most valuable aspect.	2003-06-15

As a non-fiction work, this book follows the life of Christopher McCandless through interviews with friends, family, and acquaintances.  I can relate to this individual on multiple levels as he went to high school just down the road from me.  He ran cross country in high school, as I did.  He died in Alaska and I was born and raised there.  Krakauer does a very good job of bringing to life someone that we actually know relatively little about.  Chris's story is sad and yet poignant at the same time.  It's hard not to respect not only his intellectualism, but his drive to understand the truth in life.  While this ultimately cost him his life and is in retrospect the result of decisions few of us would ever make, it does strike a cord with me.  This is one of the few stories that I actually find myself reflecting back on long after I finished reading the book.	2003-03-30

What JP did to bring dinosaurs to life, Timeline does for the Medieval Period.  Crichton has clearly done his homework, as usual, on both the technological and historical fronts.  I typically have found stories set in the Medieval Period to be rather boring as history, particularly European history does not tend to interest me.  This book managed to bring the time period to life in such a manner as to make the factual explanations every bit as interesting as the action and suspense.  While Crichton may not rank with the classic authors of all time, this book, much like Jurassic Park was a terrific page-turner.	2003-03-30

The storyline is suspenseful and fast-paced as usual though the villain is a little more down to earth than the usual drug-using freaks Sandford typically supplies us with.  In fact, it is this aspect of the story that sets it apart from his previous works in that this was a character that on some levels and in some aspects, most people can relate to as regards his everyday life.  Chances are, if you're looking at this book, you've already read at least some of the Prey series and are hooked like the rest of us.  This one doesn't disappoint.	2003-03-30
US	49189592	R3CWUTPSOXIMU	0446611611	817062475	City of Bones (Harry Bosch)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Great read	This book is one of Connelly's best and is more along the lines of Concrete Blonde, The Last Coyote, etc.  The characters are well developed and the storyline is intelligent and fast-paced.  I liked this book better than Void Moon, Black Ice or any of his science fiction genre efforts for those reasons.  If you already like Connelly's stuff, you will really enjoy this one.  If you're looking at him for the first time, it's similar to the &quot;Prey&quot; series by John Sandford.  Connelly keeps you in suspense as to the identity of the villain until the end, whereas Sandford shares the chase from the villain's perspective and you know who did it all along.	2003-03-30

I would really rate it at 3.5 stars and in reading the other reviews posted, I also note that it is certainly not a book for every one.  The book is heavily segmented in short, bursty chapters that shift from one subject to another like a worn out party drunk who can't finish a thought or make a continuous series of points.  The story really doesn't flow as it is constantly interrupted by Melville's soliloquies on history, art, culture, and philosophy.  However, there is a mosaic effect to the work that is only gained in retrospect, which is actually quite impressive.  Overall, the book is definitely worth reading, but expect to either appreciate it after you've read it or not to like it at all.	2002-07-06

It has a quick and loose flow to the story, much like the current array of slasher novels that are so popular (and which I also like).  It also makes you think both while you're reading the book and long after you've finished it, much like most of the classics.  It's not one of the all-time greats, but it does make you think on a lot of levels you probably have thought on before.  It tests your perspective on the retail intensive world and culture we live in and more than once, it makes you reassess your values and priorities.  If you have a narrow-minded view of the world around you and are afraid to challenge your current perspective and personal philosophies, you will not like this book.	2002-07-06
US	49189592	R2TH75L3X7WDFS	0553208845	36215520	Siddhartha	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Modern Classic	I found this book to be an excellent work in the tradition of many of the classics.  This is a short piece of work, really almost more of a novella and it reads quickly.  What is impressive about Hesse's work here is the depth of philosophy he delivers with such concise prose.  This is also a novel that is timeless in scope rather than being a period piece.  There are few trappings of any particular era which allows Hesse to deliver his message in a much more simple (and short) format.  In hindsight this story was a very effective method for introducing the reader to some of the basic tenets of the Buddhist religions.  This is the first of Hesse's works that I have read and I found it to be profound and powerful.  I look forward to reading more of his work.	2002-03-12

As with his first work, this novel is also written in the mosaic, multiple perspective and stream of conscience style that is definitive of his work.  This book is difficult to read and follow if read in a casual manner, but it is a definitive work and worth the effort.  As you read each chapter you likely struggle to place and interpret what you are reading into the rest of the story.  As you get closer and closer to the end, the story takes shape much as a mosaic picture takes shape when viewed with a wider perspective.	2002-01-22

The story documents the philosophy that in order for a good man to conquer or overcome evil, he himself must become evil.  This book ties in so very well with the moral and philosophical positions and issues the US Government has to address and take into consideration (...).  Conrad is a phenomally gifted author whose stories serve to consider and address the various moral and philosophical issues man is so often confronted with.  Heart of Darkness is a powerful and well-written observation on the battle of good versus evil within man's conscience.	2001-10-27

While not as complex or intriguing as 1984, Animal Farm nonetheless is worthwhile in its own right.  The book is essentially an argument against Totalitarianism or Communism delivered through an allegory of a group of animals on a farm.  The dynamic between the animals and the farmer is the medium Orwell uses to make his case.  Although it is a relatively simple and short story, it conveys a powerful message.  The book was written after &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, Orwell's autobiographical description of his participation in the Spanish Civil War and indeed takes on new and greater meaning when read after HtoC.	2001-08-06

The book's most valuable asset is that it lends credibility to Orwell's rather strong political views that are so eloquently expressed in his other works.  It is one thing to rail against Communism or Totalitarianism, it's another thing entirely to pick up a gun and do something about it at great risk to life and limb.  The book in and of itself is not a great book.  It is a description of a rather banal civil war that at times is pathetic, comical, and as with any war, ultimately sad when taken at face value.  That it is a non-fiction account of the author's participation at Catalonia sets it aside from Orwell's other work.  It has made a few top 100 lists, however, I struggled to find a justification for such a lofty ranking.  If you are a fan of Orwell, Huxley, etc or are a fan of European history then this book will appeal.  Absent such a range of interests, the (potential) reader is probably better off searching elsewhere for an engrossing novel.  Ultimately, I enjoyed this book to the extent that it allows for a much deeper perspective on Orwell and his philosphies.	2001-08-06

Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be.  The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society.  This book and its sister novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels.  Though much lighter in spirit than many other &quot;timeless&quot; works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture.	2001-04-16

What is most impressive about 1984 is that so many of the concepts discussed, either implicitly or explicity are still applicable and relevant in today's modern politics.  Doublethink as a concept is not far off from the lies today's politicians ask you to believe as they continue to become embroiled in one controversial moral or ethical crisis after another.  One has to wonder, after reading this book, if we are not in fact on our way to catastrophe ourselves in the 21st century.  Though the threat is not perhaps militant in nature, it is still real nonetheless in the form of moral decay.  This book is emminently comparable to Huxley's Brave New World and if you enjoyed one, you'll enjoy the other.	2001-03-12

It is not as polished or well targeted as some of his other works, particularly &quot;Brideshead&quot; or &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;, though this is largely due to the fact that he is writing about Hollywood rather than the English society with which he was eminently more familiar.  With one of the better endings in the top 100 of modern fiction, this book is a must read.	2001-03-05

I'm working my way through the top 100 modern classics list from the Modern Library Editorial Review Board and this was no. 55.  I have to say that as a whole, the beatnik generation really paints a rather abstract picture in its impact on modern literature.  I can see the link to Faulkner in some of Kerouac's writing, though perhaps more so in his later writings than in &quot;On the Road&quot;.  Philosophically, the book is somewhat shallow.  It's greatest strength really lies in its ability to reach people of all walks of life on some level.  I think we can all relate to the desire to explore our world and our culture and certainly our role in it all to see where the reality of our perspective meets with our expectations created by that perspective.  I can't say that the beatnik generation really had an amazing impact on our culture, but it did effect the way we all see things.  To that end, it's a very worthwhile read.	2000-12-28

I bought this book because of the NY Times review comment quoted on the back of the jacket in essence saying that this book was the true companion to &quot;On the Road&quot;.  While I can say that I was mildly interested with Kerouac's prose in &quot;On the Road&quot;, I can also say that I found this book to be absolutely awful.  Why anyone has any interest in the drunk and high reminiscing of the characters in this book is beyond me.  Abstract views on sex and drugs are fine, (eg Hunter S. Thompson), but this isn't even mildly interesting or amusing.  I had hoped, ultimately, that I would find something of value in Kerouac's style or philosophy, perhaps even something that would enable me to see the world from a different, but somehow valuable point of view... unfortunately, that was not the case.	2000-12-14
