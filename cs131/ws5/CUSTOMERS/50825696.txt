The &quot;Reader from Boston&quot; is absolutely on  target, but I'd like to add the following, abbreviated list of the myriad  problems with this book:<br />1. The hero is unable to be anything but blunt  and straightforward.<br />2. The hero possesses such skills in the art of  duplicity and subtlety that he's able to insinuate himself into the highest  realms of wartime France's government.  A terrible case of split  personality?<br />  3. At the time of the story, the hero has been spy for 6  years, has come home while Napoleon is imprisoned at Elba and returned to  Europe before Waterloo.  This would take about eight years.<br />     4. At  Waterloo, the spy magically becomes a field officer, and in the three days  of Waterloo almost starves and learns how to live and eat with every sort  of human being.  Right.<br />5. Seven years before the time of the story, the  hero's sister escapes their abusive mother and flees to America.  The hero  won't acknowledge the sister or her husband because the sister has hurt him  by leaving him, the hero, to the tender mercies of their horrible mother.  The hero was 27 years old and afraid of his mother, while he was under  cover in France?  The timeline for all these events is so out of whack, I  don't see how anybody could have missed it or overlooked it.<br />6. The hero  has an illegitimate child by a French whore.  The child is dumped on his  doorstep and while under cover, the hero sends the child to his estate in  England to be raised by servants.  No one notices the child is deaf, until  the heroine shows up.  After one, brief encounter, the heroine deduces the  child isn't troubled, but deaf, and within about two and one half months  teaches this four year old manners, cleanliness, how to communicate and how  to spell and read.  Right.<br />7. The heroine is a genius mathematician who  is thrilled because her husband essentially asks her to balance his  checkbook?  Right.<br />8. The hero is also some sort of genius scholar (He  majored in &quot;French Studies&quot; at Oxford around 1800?  Right!) who  overlooks a recent, single, very large deposit in his banking account and  multiplies a number by 3 instead of 300?  Weird.<br />9. The heroine is a  botanist of such amazing skills that in the space of about three months,  beginning around September, she rejuvenates a neglected flower garden, and  it is a garden of such beauty, the characters are enjoying this remarkable  floral display in November, and she's worried that her husband has picked  her roses (in full bloom, by the way) sometime in late January or February.   A genius, indeed.<br />  10. The characters move between the United States  and England with amazing ease during a declared war between the two  countries (the author's put so many other things in the story, however,  taking on the War of 1812 might have been daunting even for her).<br />If you  can suspend reality long enough to ignore these types of gross errors, you  may enjoy the book.  Otherwise, save your money.	2000-09-13

Her books are intelligent (not a common acholade for this genre),  entertaining, and convincing.  The situation where the hero paints himself  into a corner through his own &quot;cleverness&quot; is terrific, and the  heroine's faithfulness to her &quot;mystery&quot; lover is perfect irony,  and there's the bonus of Ms. Ivory's prose, which is almost lyrical.	2000-09-13

There are no cardboard characters, and no  easy answers or judgments.  The business side of trading in human beings:  deplorable, ugly and interesting.  Right and wrong and all the shades in  between.  The book is not sympathetic to an appalling business, but a  realistic look at a conspiracy of cultures, (including the Africans who  captured and sold slaves) survival and the profit motive.  There is a  compelling romance in this book, which begins with an eye for an eye sort  of justice.  It's not pretty or comfortable, but it is a page-turner.	2000-09-12

I love  nineteenth century novels, and the prose in this book is amongst the best  I've encountered by a 20th Century novelist.  It's rich, sensuous, a  tactile experience with words.  When the little oddities started showing  up, I couldn't figure whether I was irritated that he'd ruined a perfectly  good book by adopting the rather quirky, experimental art forms common to  the 1960's and 70's, or whether I was struck dumb by the sheer brilliance  of the experiment.  In regard to the meaning of it all, I have to agree  with every reviewer here, including the one who gave it one star.  I  pondered the existentialism, concluded, revised, dismissed, pondered,  concluded with proviso's, and on and on until I felt like Elliot's poor  women, coming and going and talking about Michaelangelo.  Wouldn't it be a  stitch if the author meant this as a grand prank, and every single one of  us has fallen into the trap?  Brilliant.  Buy it and read it because it  just might be the masterpiece it's purported to be, and if it's not, well,  it's at least an interesting puzzle.	2000-09-07

To  those reviewers who actually believe this is a great piece of writing, may  I observe that they have been wandering the wasteland of romance too long  and they need to wander a couple of isles over to the &quot;classic&quot;  section.  Perhaps if they delve into the works of Dickens or Hardy or  Austen or even Hemmingway, they might be able to discern the difference  between a great writer and the verbal equivalent of fingernails scrapping a  blackboard.	2000-09-07

It's one of those most wonderful of parables in that it speaks to many  people on many levels, and none of what's said is wrong.  I loved the  single line bits of wisdom and advise interspersed throughout the book (my  favorite:  If you're still alive, your mission must not be done.), but the  theme I needed to hear was the most glorious thing about the Father's plan  is that it's all up to us.  It's our choice, and not even God's current  Messiah will force us.  He must, indeed, love his children.<br />I absolutely  recommend this book.  It may open some doors; it may close some; it may  inspire or it may irritate accepted theology, but it's not a waste.  Bach,  like the reluctant student, tells us that this book kept pushing him and  pushing him until he finally gave in and wrote it.  No matter; he still had  a choice.	2000-09-07

I never did  understand why the Montgomery chap went West or why he stayed so long.  The  ego of the heroine was only exceeded by her general stupidity, and when the  hero and heroine get together, it's amongst the most disgusting couplings  imaginable.  (A log cabin, with a force that pushes the heroine across a  floor---full of either splinters or dirt---and bangs her head up the wall  while 100 or so miners are outside taking bets on when they'll come out.   YUK.)  The little sister is also a strange character.  She speaks with a  hill billy accent, even though she grows up in the Rockies and has a  cultured mother and an educated father.  Apparently Ms. Deveraux watched  &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; one too many times.	2000-09-06

There are probably many with this ability, but there are  also, regrettably, many charlatans.  In regard to the skeptic who  challenges for some great piece of knowledge from the medium, I must say  that one of the things, which convinced me of Mr. Andersen's ability, was  the very lack of &quot;great secrets revealed&quot;.  Mediumship has a  reason and a purpose, but I don't believe it's to reveal the secrets of  history nor the universe nor to give someone the winning lottery number.  I  am convinced that Anderson is one of the best, and I only wish I could  afford to have a reading.  Barring a personal reading, it's comforting to  read of other's.	2000-09-06

I was given a burden which I believe  is one of the heaviest God asks any of His children to carry, and this book  helped set me on a spiritual path which ultimately saved my life and my  sanity.  This is not an easy or sweet look at God's messengers.  It  explores angels in history, in literature, in religions and throughout most  cultures.  I grew up in a religion which was very narrow and which didn't  place emphasis on angels except as they ministered to great people.  This  book changed my mind and opened whole new doors and avenues for  exploration.  I've been on that journey of encouragement and hope for four  years now, and because of it, I see traditional theology differently and  MORE POSITIVELY. I believe the writing of this book was inspired and I  can't thank Ms. Burnham enough for giving me this stepping stone.  I've had  many unexpected and beautiful experiences in the midst of a grief so  profound it's at times physically painful, and this is one of the books  which helped me accept those experiences and know that reality is much more  than the confines of the world we see.	2000-09-06

This is not  an easy read, but it's one everyone should undertake, just as everyone who  has the opportunity should visit the Holocaust Muzeum in Washington, D. C.   It is too horrible to accept, let alone understand, but this book helps,  and God forbid that we ever forget.  This book will help, and while  &quot;entertaining&quot; is not a word I'd use to describe this  masterpiece, it is riviting and unforgettable.	2000-09-06

The heroine deals with a dark secret in a  unique way; she's funny, bright and thoroughly likable.  The hero is a  typical jock, and even though he unabashedly refuses to get in touch with  his feminine side, he's also funny, bright and thoroughly likable.  When  these two finally get together, it's the cumulation of every half time  extravaganza of every Superbowl ever played.  Susan Elizabeth Phillips is  one of my very favorite writers of romance and this is one of my two  favorites of her books.  If you like contemporary romance, which contain  adult humor which is subtle enough to be really funny, don't miss this one.   Hot cha cha, indeed.	2000-09-06

The woman  (heroine?)was a victim of her parents and was willingly manipulated by an  awful father.  Her husband?  I actually liked him better than her since he  at least acknowledged he had a problem.  What I really find shocking,  though, is the attitude of the reviewers.  One calls the issue of beating  up women a &quot;controversial&quot; subject.  One relegates this violence  to &quot;political correctness&quot;.  I really thought beating the h---  out of someone smaller than you was universially deplored (except by the  perpetrator).  There's nothing controversial or political about beating up  women and children.  It's quite simply disgusting and the bully who does it  is a scum bag.	2000-09-06

Stranger still?  It  works.  It really does, and the result is enchanting.  The hero is  magnificently well-adjusted AND masculine (reminds me of Jamie in Diana  Gabaldon's books).  He's comfortable in his own skin and teaches the  heroine how to be comfortable in hers too. I understand the reviewer who  complained about the ending and some of the plot devices, and even though I  think she's right, I can't explain why for me, with this book, these  problems were no problems.  Perhaps because the characters were so very  charming.  I loved it.  If Ms. Ivory's other books even come close to  this---well, I'm hooked.	2000-09-01

It was very, very  ugly, and Lily seemed to recover so very, very easily that I found it  totally unbelievable.  What happened to Lily was akin to what happened to  Jamie in &quot;Outlander&quot; and that one scene in &quot;Outlander&quot;  almost ruined the book for me, and what happened to Lily never left my mind  at any point in this book.  It was simply too dark to be glossed over.    Nonetheless, the book was interesting enough and well written enough to  keep my interest, although I will never, ever re-read it.	2000-09-01

The outline or the bones of this book are great, but  the story really needs to be fleshed out.  I also think this would have  been a bit more interesting if the heroine were older than 18.  In short,  this would have been absolutely wonderful if it had been a full-length  book.  Maybe this is one of those instances when an author ought to  consider an update or rewrite, because this has the potential of being a  best seller.  (But, please, please don't do it, Miss Ballogh, unless you  love the story and characters enough to do a better job than Catherine  Coulter in her attempts at rewrites).  With these provisos, I thoroughly  enjoyed the book.  If not entirely satisfying, it was nonetheless a quick  and enjoyable read.	2000-09-01

The minor characters are drawn with such a wide brush, they are almost  caricatures, but somehow, that even worked and the end result was charming.   It's a lovely story and deals with death in a spiritual way (almost  unheard of in romance).  From the blurb in the back cover, I noted Ms.  Kelly is involved in the Hospice program, which is probably why this  portion of the book is both lovely and has substance.  I was also impressed  that Ms. Kelly understands the titles and rituals of the Church of England,  and treats them and prayer with something more than a plot device.  This is  rare in romance.  This was my first book by this author, but it won't be my  last.  I was totally impressed.	2000-09-01

RESULTS:  (1) The heroine blames the hero because he was late for the  appointment and tells him she never wants to see him again.  The hero goes.   (2)  The hero blames the scientist father because years ago, his mother  died in child birth because they were away from civilization and the kid  blowing up the lab is somehow also the father's fault and the hero swears  never to see his father again.  Now the really good one, (3) The heroine's  father blames the hero for his son's death also, and so he kicks the  heroine out (even though she's just kicked out her husband) and disinherits  her.

US	50825696	R204OVSRD3BOQR	0312966806	74138788	Tell Me Lies	Books	1	9	16	N	N	A Great Disappointment	I had heard so many good things about this author, I couldn't wait to find  one of her books.  Perhaps that's why I disliked this book so much.  The  humor was smart mouthed, and forced, with no wit, and in some places it was  totally inappropriate to the situation.  Irma Bombeck or Susan Elizabeth  Phillips she is not.  The heroine was a classic &quot;I want to be your  victim&quot; type, and although she was an art teacher, she apparently had  no sense of style or color in her own home, and judging from how she  handled her own daughter, she obviously had never taken a child development  class while she was getting her teaching certificate.  The children in this  story talked like adults from a sitcom, and the author's understanding of  death and bereavement for both parents who have lost a child and a child  who has lost a beloved parent, is so shallow, it's insulting.  In this  regard, it's a strange small town where the heroine didn't know the local  undertaker.  <br />Which brings me to a comment about this &quot;typical&quot;  small town.  Gossip is not cute.  It is viscous and ugly and hurts people  badly.  I grew up in a small town, and viscous gossips were no more liked  or admired there than they were in the big city in which I spent my  adulthood.  Also, the idea that a small town would somehow flaunt justice  and &quot;take care of their own&quot; even though their own was a murderer  is an insult to every small town in the U.S.  In addition, the grandmother  whom everyone describes as &quot;feisty&quot; and &quot;gutsy&quot; is a  woman who killed her first husband, betrayed her second husband several  times, and verbally abuses her daughter and granddaughter in the ugliest  possible way.  I found nothing cute or admirable about her.  The love story  in this book was superficial, and the murder mystery was only interesting  in that you finally found out why you had to read page upon page of  uninteresting gossip (which would be uninteresting even if you knew the  people involved).  <br />I was so hoping for another Susan Elizabeth Phillips,  but this author doesn't even come close.	2000-08-30

Move to San Francisco.  It's some kind of legal free zone.  <br />Here's the setup.  Nick  and Daisy were once stepsiblings (his father, her mother).  His father  kicks Daisy and mom out one day, and because he'd been married several  times and was going broke paying alimony, he smeared mom's name all over  the tabloids by telling them mom was having a lurid affair with his best  friend.  The tabloids fell for it, printed it, and dad had no alimony this  time around.  You see, there are no divorce lawyers in SF and no liable  laws in California.  A couple of years later, Daisy and Nick meet again,  and he deflowers her (she's nineteen).  After the act and after telling her  he loves her, he puts on his pants and leaves with, &quot;It's been nice.   See you around.&quot;   Years pass and Nick is a photographer and Daisy's  an ex-cop with her own security business.  Nick accidentally takes a  picture of an upstanding citizen who's in line for an ambassadorship doing  the dirty with a young lady who is not this good citizen's wife.  That very  night, two thugs show up demanding the film, which is stashed in Nick's  photo bag behind the front seat of his car.  The thorough thugs do not look  there; instead, they dislocate Nick's shoulder, tear up his dark room and  leave when the neighbors call the cops. At this point, Nick still doesn't  know what's on that film, even though the ambassador-to-be does (although  how he knows, we don't know-details, details).  In the meantime, Nick's  sister is having a small problem.  Because the banking laws are pretty  loose in California (never mind about those bothersome federal laws), she  takes some money from an escrow account and now has to pay it back.  Well,  when Nick discovers the incriminating photos, the lights go on real bright.   He'll sell the pictures to the tabloids and help sis out.  Thenext day,  Nick goes looking for a bodyguard who's both competent and within his  budget.  I don't want to ruin it for you, but guess who fits the bill?   Nick doesn't tell Daisy the real story about the negatives because she  wouldn't approve.  Daisy moves into Nick's apartment, and the very next  day, the thugs try to run Nick over on a public street.  Nick won't file a  police report because there's no proof (we all know this isn't the first  time the State of California has had a problem with &quot;probable  cause&quot;).  The next day, the thugs show up again, this time with guns.   Daisy promptly dispatches them, and I stopped reading (page 145).<br />Without  stating the obvious, I think this plot could use a little fine-tuning.   First of all, the investigating officer after the break-in had to be that  idiot some village is missing.  He left the film with Nick?  Or maybe he  just didn't see the connection between the assault and the film the thugs  were looking for-keep in mind, Nick doesn't yet know he's got a gold mine.   The car incident also has a bit of a plotting problem, but it's a  masterpiece of sophism.  You see, the REAL reason Nick doesn't file a  police report is because Daisy would find out what's really on the film,  and therefore, Nick's lie.  Nick told Daisy the pictures were of a woman  doing the deed who's getting a divorce from an abusive husband, and if Nick  lets the police know about the pictures, the abusive husband would take it  out on the poor woman, even though the abusive husband is now on an out of  control crime spree.  Daisy, the ex-cop, accepts this reasoning.  Well, you  know how hard it is in California to get those abusive husbands off the  streets?<br />I would go into the romantic twists and turns, but I think I've  probably confused you enough.  Besides with this kind of a plot, the  romance is superfluous, and I'll even refrain from telling you Nick's  reason for acting like an unprincipled jerk in the first place.  Trust me,  though.  His reason is as brilliant as the rest of the plot.   Have fun!  (and P.D. James can rest easy tonight)	2000-05-26

Obviously, this means little to her multitude of fans, but if you agree this sort of unskilled writing  defeats the purpose of reading as surely as wrong notes defeat the purpose  of a symphony, be warned!  Whether one likes a story and its characters is  subjective, but there are rules governing the construction of sentences,  and  I think an author's failing in this area is akin to a bricklayer not  being able to use a trowel.   <br />I've read the first 50 pages of this book,  and I want my money back.  I'm not upset over a few sloppy sentences or a  bit of confusing syntax here and there.  I'm not referring to one or two  paragraphs containing disparate or extraneous sentences.  I'm talking about  almost every sentence and almost every paragraph. May I share a few random  examples?<br />&quot;Expression unconvinced, Giles changed...&quot; [Have you  ever tried to convince an expression of anything?  But then the expressions  in this book do a lot of things.  Read on.]<br />&quot;Voice dangerously soft,  Maxie said....&quot; [Since it takes Ms. Putney two paragraphs to describe a  walk down the hall, and another for raising a hand to knock on a door, and  yet another while the hero contemplates standing vice sitting, I can't  figure out why she tosses out necessary pronouns and adjectives.]  <br />&quot;She shoved all but one of the arrows point-first into the earth  near her right hand, then nocked the remaining shaft.&quot;  [The imagery  here is priceless.  Is she trying to tell us poor Maxie's right arm is  closer to the ground than the left?  Also, this made me wonder what would  happen if Maxie tried to put the arrows in the other way around.  Point  first!  Clever girl, Maxie.  But then, what can you expect from a heroine  named after a feminine hygene product?]<br />&quot;Her expression, however,  had returned to its normal determination after two months of  drifting.&quot;  [Where did it drift to?  The Himalayas?  Are drifting  expressions painful?]<br />You get my drift?  Every page is filled to  overflowing with this sort of writing.  I wish publishers would take note  and stamp these books with a disclaimer, &quot;Warning!  Published Before  Editing!&quot;	2000-05-25
US	50825696	RLM64NGB30WTP	0671778633	119994188	Bewitching	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A Jewel	This is a full-blown, suspend reality, Fairy Tale.  The heroine is an inept witch; the hero is so up tight, if he lived today, he'd be an accountant or a nuclear engineer, pocket protector and all.  The situations  are a stitch; the one-liners are laugh aloud funny; and the deflowering  (for those who have read the book, no pun intended!), is the funniest I've  ever read.  (When the hero says the expected, &quot;I know this is hurting  you!&quot; she responds, &quot;If it hurts you too, why are we doing  this?&quot;---and it gets funnier.)  I can't believe my good fortune in  discovering Loretta Chase AND Jill Barnett in the same month!  I do so  enjoy a good romance, which is also very frustrating since there are so few  good authors.  I don't even mind trite if it's well written and amusing (as  in the author uses words over one syllable correctly and can write a  grammatically correct sentence).  Anyway, &quot;Bewitching.&quot; is right  up there with &quot;Lord Scoundrel&quot; and some of the better Julie  Garwood books, and I am now on the hunt for every book Ms. Barnett has ever  had published, which is the best compliment I can give any author.  Thank  you, Ms. Barnett, and please keep writing.	2000-05-19

Linda Howard is Addictive	This was the first Linda Howard book I read, and it was sooooo good, it sent me combing through used book stores and garage sales looking for her out of print books.  This was also the book that introduced me to paperback  romances, and began my search for other authors as good as Howard (alas,  there are very, very few). I'd always enjoyed romance, but had never  ventured beyond Anya Seton, M.M. Kaye, the Bronte sisters, Jane Austin,  Georgette Heyer, Margaret Mitchell, Jan Cox Speas, etc.  Obviously, there  was a finite number of these books, which led me to set aside assumption  and try pulp fiction. I'm glad I did because some of it (like  &quot;Midnight Rainbow&quot;) is wonderful fun. Thank you, Miss Howard, for  hours of pure reading pleasure.  I just wish I could find several of your  equals, or failing that, I wish you could write a bit faster.	2000-05-05
US	50825696	R1H3XCJ5L8XLKR	0899668143	829916644	Katherine	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Classic	I first read it as a teenager and have re-read it more than a dozen times.  I would recommend this book to students who couldn't see the point of reading for fun, and without exception, they began to understand the  absolute joy of curling up in a quiet corner with a good book.  I also  credit this book with giving me an enduring interest in history and  politics.  She draws you into the period and so you end with a very real  understanding of why there is such reverence for the Magna Carta.  Anya  Seton is a solid historian, and a truly great story teller, and I credit  her for giving me one of my greatest gifts:  a love of reading.  This book  is not one of the &quot;accepted&quot; classics, but because of this book,  I ended by actually enjoying the accepted ones.  No, she is not Dickens or  Austin or Dostoyevsky or even Mark Twain.  But this book is a fine piece of  writing and a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I can't imagine anyone being  disappointed, and I agree with the reviewer who laments that the book is no  longer widely circulated.  In fact, I find it difficult to believe that  Hollywood hasn't discovered it.  Someone ought to take note.	2000-05-05

If you are hooked on Linda Howard, even her bad books are winners, and this is one of the really good ones.  Action packed and sexy (and nobody, but nobody writes sexier novels).  Kell is a to die for hunk  (Yea, yea, I know.  Stereotype.  But so's Mel Gibson, and I'm not  complaining.)  Rachael is bright, strong, independent and thoroughly  likeable.  This is romance with a capital &quot;R&quot; and another LH  winner.	2000-05-05
US	50825696	RO1MQH5AURIZU	0451199979	234694502	Devilish	Books	2	10	22	N	N	Very, Very Disappointing--Boring	I am truly sorry to give this book such a low rating, but it's really not worth reading.  I can see the influence of Georgette Heyer, here, but without the charm or wit.  I can see the possibility of a gothic hero, but  without the romance and mystery of Jane Eyre; I can see the need to make it  intelligent by  quoting the classics, but quotes alone and obvious  symbolism doesn't bring it all together.  Also, the sex is much, much too  sophisticated and &quot;cold&quot;-and the reference to Sapho just makes it  off-putting (if I wanted that sort of thing, there are some fairly specific  sites on the Internet-it simply doesn't appeal to bisexuals who buy  romantic novels).  I once had a professor, who explained why realism just  wasn't a good venue for the rich and privileged, and he was right-it's like  an orchestra where the viola section is off key.  Realism is a good way to  explain the poor folk, but when used with the privileged classes, it's more  like whining than living.  I read the other reviews which is what prompted  me to buy the book.  OK.  I'll admit she's intelligent to a certain extent,  but if I want to read &quot;intelligent&quot;, I read Dostoyefsky or  Solzhenitsyn or Shakespeare or Joyce or even George B. Shaw.  I buy  romances for the same reason I watch comedies.  They are a titillating  escape, and if they pretend to have depth, they should be more like a soap  opera than an opera.  In short, the emotions should be involved here, and  her characters don't have emotions.  (Sort of like Bill and Hillary)   Rothgar would be a very proper preacher or politician-can you imagine  having sex with General Robert E. Lee?  Same thing.  All duty, all  sophistication, no sweat (literally).  (I think she based him on the hero  in Heyer's book, &quot;These Old Shades,&quot; but the reason Heyer's  character was lovable and interesting was because he was, well, wicked and  forbidden and innocence conquered him.).  The heroine is also very  unlovable.  She would make a great congresswoman, but a lousy companion.   (I know congresswomen and congressmen-and I don't know one who I would put  in a romantic novel.)  Don't get me wrong.  I like strong women characters,  but this one is also too good to enjoy knowing  (I'd never go to lunch with  her, let alone happy hour).  She's so caught up in her earldom (and she is  NOT Elizabeth I) and its attendant power; I wonder why she doesn't continue  to just have sex with herself (which she apparently does--and which some of  us also find off-putting); she is admirable, but dull.  She has no verve,  no life, and no passion.  <br />I can't really find an exact reason why I  dislike this book.  Maybe it's because neither hero nor heroine has a sense  of humor.  Also, the political intrigue was boring-and I mean deathly  boring.  I skipped pages in this.  Also, the book didn't even get started  until page 166-before that, you read synopses of her other books.  <br />She  understands the idiosyncrasies of the Georgian period, but it's purely  factual-there is no love or affection for the period and its mannerisms,  and it comes across.  Again, I refer to Heyer who could draw you into the  period she was writing about and make you want to experience it.  Beverley  makes you feel like you're taking a tour with the docent of a museum.  Sort  of interesting, but boring (that word just keeps coming up!).<br />This book  was above all, frustrating.  The lady can write.  She could probably be  very good, but there is no emotion in her book; there is no fun, no  acceptance that she is a writer of romance not classics.  She needs to  relax and enjoy her genre, and not try to be what she is not.	2000-05-05

This lady couldn't pass freshman English, let alone get published (and I would really, really like to know how that happened).  The guy in this book is a self-centered dork, with no  redeeming qualities.  The lady is ok, except for her judgment in men.  The  plot is stupid, the writing is less than sophomoric--how, please could this  get a 5 star rating unless her friends are writing in?  No kidding, this  book is so bad, it's embarrassing!  Please don't encourage her.  She needs  to keep her day job.	2000-05-05

She is a lovely soul and just the like that lost sheep Christ spoke of.  She makes me  smile, and I'm sure she makes Jesus smile.  What a gift she is, and I thank  her for sharing.<br />By the way I must comment on a couple of the reviewers'  observations.  This book is a compilation of autobiographical sketches.  I  can understand why it isn't everyone's cup of tea, but  complaining that an  autobiography is about the author is a bit strange.  I was also interested  in the lady who was in the hospital and Jesus didn't visit her, therefore,  Annie was making it all up. Ah, the powers of deductive reasoning.  I never  wrote a symphony, ergo, neither did Beethoven.  Finally, am I the only one  who thinks perhaps that person claiming to be an &quot;English lit  prof&quot; from Cornell is diddling with the truth?  If he is, indeed, who  he claims, I strongly urge him carefully review his &quot;Strunk and  White&quot; before he attempts another review or teaches another class.	2000-04-16

Ms. Chase has talent and wit, and I'm sorry I just discovered her.  I would like to read all her books, but am unwilling to spend ( )for a paperback  on the secondary market.  Are there any plans to reprint her older novels?   Seems to me it would be a smart move by both the publisher and the author.   <br />Excellent, Ms. Chase.  Thank you.	2000-04-15

She's obviously educated, and she weaves an enchanting tale.  Her descriptions are wonderful, and if you enjoy language for its own sake, you will enjoy this book.  If you like Anya Seton's work, you  will probably like this book.
