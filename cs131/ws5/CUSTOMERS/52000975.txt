For Napa Valley wine lovers, 1976 is the turning point in the history of what is now considered to be one of the world's truly great wine producing regions. That's the year that two California wines beat two French wines in a blind tasting at a Parisian wine shop. When the news appeared on the pages of Time Magazine, it seemed to legitimize Napa wines in the eyes of many wine lovers.<br /><br />The trouble with pointing at 1976 as a turning point in the history of Napa Valley wines -- and of California wines by extension -- is that the year is really just a single point on a long timeline. Like 476 (the date generally accepted to mark the fall of the Roman Empire), 1476 (the start of the Renaissance in Florence), 1776 (the independence of the United States), or 1876 (the invention of the telephone), the date is a culmination of a process that started years before and that continued to evolve for years afterwards. It's a kind of shorthand that references something that is without a doubt cheated when it is reduced to a date and a one-paragraph explanation.<br /><br />But if you accept the premise of the 1976 turning point, then it would be impossible to find someone better equipped to tell the story than author and journalist George M. Taber. Mr. Taber was the Time correspondent who -- when faced with a slow news day -- decided to attend what was supposed to be a gimmick wine tasting in Paris nearly 30 years ago.<br /><br />The results are well known: the 1973 Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon and the Chateau Montelena Chardonnay from the same year handily beat their better known and costlier French rivals from Bordeaux and Burgundy -- despite being judged by a panel of French wine experts (no Americans were included). It was a man-bites-dog story that captured the wine world's attention.<br /><br />\\"It seemed like a nonevent -- clearly France would win,\\" Mr. Taber wrote, recalling his opinion before the tasting. But the event also seemed to \\"a perfectly wonderful way to spend an otherwise slow afternoon.\\"<br /><br />The final sentence of the article has become nearly legendary: \\"California (wines) defeated all of Gaul.\\"<br /><br />The account of the afternoon, the circumstances that led up to it, and the events that followed make for fun and informative reading. Mr. Taber gets points for being a compelling storyteller, with a crisp no-nonsense writing style one would expect from a veteran journalist.<br /><br />My criticism -- as I write this I am wavering between awarding three or four stars -- is that the story seems to take the event too seriously. Even aside from the necessary shorthand of focusing on a single event to tell a larger story, it seems to inflate the importance of the developments of May 24, 1976 beyond that.<br /><br />The word \\"revolution\\" appears on the book's 336 pages scores of times, but I don't think that what happened can rightfully be referred to with the R word. French wines were considered the best in the world before the tasting; they are considered the best in the world now. They fetch the highest prices at auction; their names are the most recognizable to wine lovers.<br /><br />Mr. Taber contends that has happened to a large degree because after 1976, the French started to copy certain aspects of the California winemaking style. But the degree to which that happened is dwarfed by the number of ways in which California wine makers emulated the French both before 1976 and afterwards.<br /><br />What's more, the very fact that California wines were invited to take place in the 1976 tasting proved that they were no longer from a land best known for the bulk production of insipid sacramental wines, as California had been in the 1940s and 1950s.<br /><br />My guess is that the reputation of California wines would be almost exactly the same as is today without that fateful tasting 29 years ago and without Mr. Taber's account of it then and now. The only difference is that it might have taken a bit longerto get there -- and the tale told about it would probably make for a much less interesting read.it might have taken a bit longer to get there -- and the tale told about it would probably make for a much less interesting read.	2005-09-13

As would be expected, Seymour Hersh's writing is as always clean and angry and compelling. And the conclusions the investigative reporting icon draws are well thought out and more than a little frightening.<br /><br />In short: if you can read only one book in this genre this year, you've found it.<br /><br />A reader examining Mr. Hersh's work for the first time here may not realize how far ahead of the curve he has been in exposing scores of intelligence failures, poorly thought out national security initiatives, and the horrible Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Many of Mr. Hersh's points were treated with suspicion when they were made, only to be accepted as common wisdom when the full story became known (though the book's editors would have done well to make that clearer, but more on that in a moment).<br /><br />His main point in Chain of Command is all these issues -- the selective evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, the sidestepping of the federal bureaucracy and the diminished importance of Congress, the misuse of intelligence, the abuse of human rights abroad, foreign policy zealotry, and so on (I might add elections-related shenanigans from four years ago) -- amount to a kind of coup d'&eacute;tat, and it's hard to argue against his points.<br /><br />Clearly, Mr. Hersh is outraged in Chain of Command, but what earns my respect the most if the fact that his anger is not partisan, but instead based on what he seems to see as a widening gulf between what is happening in the U.S. and because of the U.S. and what comes out of the mouths of senior government officials. Mr. Hersh is an old-fashioned muckraker and proud of it.<br /><br />Now allow me to quibble for a moment.<br /><br />The vast bulk of Chain of Command was distilled from around 20 articles Mr. Hersh wrote for the New Yorker, though editors updated a few subjects and juggled the order a bit, most obviously to emphasize new reporting regarding Abu Ghraib. I would have argued in favor of printing the original articles as they were published, in chronological order and with dates on them -- something that would have elegantly presented the material without begging the question of what was known when. The updated information could have easily been presented in a short epilogue to each chapter or to the whole book.<br /><br />Additionally, Mr. Hersh on a few occasions threatens to undermine some of his credibility by relying on speculation on subjects like prison conditions at Guant&aacute;namo, and by making only passing references to minor evidence that could weaken his arguments, on subjects such as troop movements between Afghanistan and Iraq. But he never crosses the line in a way that has damned many of the other books out this political season, thanks in a large part to his solid reputation launched when he broke the story about the My Lai massacre in Vietnam 35 years ago.<br /><br />But these points are very, very minor compared to the points this very important book makes. I rarely give five-star ratings to books, but I have no second thoughts in doing that here.20 articles Mr. Hersh wrote for the New Yorker, though editors updated a few subjects and juggled the order a bit, most obviously to emphasize new reporting regarding Abu Ghraib.

As a serious discussion of evil -- something I held out hope for until a couple of minutes after I cracked open the cover -- it is far too superficial and haphazard. A light and fun treatment of the subject? Um, doesn't writing something about evil preclude that tact?<br /><br />Instead, we're left with an an almost random list of people who, at the highest levels, are responsible for some truly atrocious events (Adolph Hitler is first; Ossama bin Laden eighth), then eroding into a list of rapists, assassins, and serial killers at the middle levels, before concluding with the world's most famous sexual fetishist (the Marquis De Sade) and a couple of computer virus writers. Almost half of the evildoers are from the U.S.; almost all are men.<br /><br />None of this is to belittle the horrible to nasty things these people did, though it could be argued that the format of this book does that. The whole concept is similar to learning about food by writing about the hundred most tasty meals ever prepared, or discussing parenting by ranking the hundred best-behaved children ever to be potty trained. It's absurd. Much more interesting would have been an investigation into what kind of psychology makes people evil, or of historical trends regarding the subject.<br /><br />But there are other problems:<br /><br />--How do you rank kinds of evil? The whole process requires some kind of formula based on how much persecution is worth how many murders, that the murder of anonymous masses is worth more or less than a high degree of sexual perversion, a lack of sanity, or a low IQ, and puts a ratio on how much property damage is worth a human life.<br /><br />--Also, how good is the history this information in based on? Comparing the well-documented evils of Nazi leaders with the myth of someone like Vlad The Impaler, the historical character that Count Dracula is based on who is ranked in the top ten and who may or may not have existed ... well, you see the point, which is made over and over again.<br /><br />--There are many factual errors. The number of dead listed for the battle of Antietam is actually the number of men killed, injured, or missing. Chilean dictator Salvador Allende was not a Communist. And no serious commentator has blamed Iraq's Sadam Hussein for the anthrax attacks in the U.S. in 2001. There are many more examples.<br /><br />--Then, as with any top 100 compilation, what about those left off the list? Africa and Latin America are woefully underrepresented. What about the perpetrators of apartheid in South Africa or of the African slave trade? Or Fransisco Pizarro, who destroyed the great Inca capital of Cusco and killed tens of thousands of natives so he could send their gold and silver home, to the smelters of Sevilla? What about Abamael Guzman, the founder of Latin Americas bloodiest rebel group, or Alfredo Stroessener, who ran Paraguay as a haven for ex-Nazis and who left his country a generation behind most of the rest of the continent?<br /><br />In the end, the book's limited value is as a collection of mini biographies of despicable characters aimed at the small niche of people interested in rubber necking at an almost random collection of people who left a negative mark on history. For anything beyond that, this book is not up to the task.d who may or may not have existed ... well, you see the point, which is made over and over again. <br /> <br />--There are many factual errors.

It is an unmeasurable quality: a combination of soil, climate, character, history, and tradition that enthusiastic tasters say they can recognize in the wine. It is why a specific wine tastes the way it does and not the way one produced a few hundred yards away tastes.<br /><br />Though Napa Valley is certainly a newcomer compared to the oldest wine-growing areas in France, Italy, and Germany, Napa certainly does have history, and certain patches of it are celebrated for producing wines that have enough sophistication and depth to stand up to any other wines in the world.<br /><br />But to what extent does that mean California wines have a quality like terroir?<br /><br />It's an interesting question and one that deserves a book that includes a thorough and lively treatment. The Winemakers Dance, unfortunately, is not that book -- although not for a lack of trying.<br /><br />Passionate authors Jonathan Swinchatt and David Howell are geologists by trade, and it shows by the way they attempt to argue for terroir in Napa from the ground up -- including scores of geological maps and aerial views of the valley floor and nearby mountains. The authors discuss many of the key players and vineyards in the region in great detail.<br /><br />The problem is that despite the authors' attempt to create something accessible to and compelling for the general public, the books falls far short of that, remaining for the most part an academic treatise. Amazon's description of the book got it right: \\"exhaustive and ... exhausting.\\" I am a bit of a wine buff myself, with a mid-sized and growing collection of wine books, but this was tough to get through, and a third of the way through I gave up trying to read it cover to cover and instead settled on a strategy of picking through the tests for parts that captured my attention.<br /><br />Am I disappointed I bought it? No, not too much, despite my complaints, The Winemakers Dance taught me a great deal about the relationship between the winemaker and the land in Napa Valley. But it's back on my shelf now, and, unfortunately, I think it'll probably stay there.e tests for parts that captured my attention.  <br /> <br />Am I disappointed I bought it?

If you are in that same category, then author Toby Faber's passionate and well-written Stradivarius: Five Violins, One Cello and a Genius is worth a look..<br /><br />I didn't say it is a must-read, because any conclusions one draws about these outstanding instruments after reading the book's 300 or so pages comes from a kind of triangulation based on the six chapters, one each about the six best-known examples of violin-maker Antonio Stradivari's work. Each story is compelling in a different way -- my favorite is about the so-called \\"Messiah,\\" believed to be the only Stradivarius in existence that has never been played -- but the quality of each tale varies a bit.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes from the book is from the writer George Eliot. \\"Tis God [who] gives skill,\\" she wrote, \\"but not without men's hands ... He could not make Antonio Stradivari's violins without Antonio.\\" Quite an endorsement from a writer not known for hyperbole.<br /><br />The most interesting theme with a subject like this one is how and why these instruments made with relatively crude technology and tested by Mr. Stradivari's more or less untrained ear during a brief span starting more than 300 years ago have elicited praise like Ms. Eliot's and, according to most experts, have never been equalled in quality. But that important story is told here as much by implication as by intent; I would have liked to have seen more discussion or analysis in this area, perhaps in some kind of concluding or summary chapter.	2004-11-04

(\\"Hello\\" in Molvanian)<br /><br />I've written a few chapters in travel guidebooks over the years, and in my travels I've leafed through many more of these sometimes-haughty volumes. That background was enough for me to instantly smile at the idea of a fictional satire like The Jetlag Travel Guide to Molvania: A Land Untouched by Modern Dentistry. The idea at first seems so simple and clever that it's surprising someone didn't come up with it sooner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like a comedian who only tells jokes about one subject, this gag started to wear thin long before I reached the end. I've seen some criticism of this book for being insensitive toward Eastern Europe, where the made-up republic of Molvania is purportedly located. But I think the real problem is that my knowing smiles at the purposely bland explanations of Molvania's currency exchange and mail service soon give way to the ability to almost guess the punch line before reading it.<br /><br />The book does have its moments, mostly because authors Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, and Rob Sitcht are skilled at accurately mimicing the tone of various travel guides found in any backpacker's backpack. Amazingly, the book seems to have given birth to a cult of misinformation about this would-be country: one bogus news report I saw announced that Molvania had been removed from the Eurovision song contest, where it would have competed with a song written in badly broken English that starts with the words in the title to this review (the music video is available online).<br /><br />Despite its strengths, I see the whole project as an intelligent and worthwhile joke stretched far beyond its value. I have read that there are more Jetlag Travel Guides on the way -- one about a made-up Latin American backwater, and another about a fictional African nation. After reading the Molvania edition, I can only hope that the announced future plans are another elaborate hoax like the one that created this unfortunate toothless republic.<br /><br />Grovzsgo!

It's melodramatic, but I always saw these things as symptoms of a culture bent on cheapening itself, where being able to act and talk like an expert was just as good as being one.<br /><br />But as a worked through this thick little book my dislike softened a bit, and even if it never really became anything warm it did turn into a kind of begrudging acceptance. In the end, I'm glad I didn't buy this book myself -- it was a gift -- but I'm also glad I read it.<br /><br />Most of the book's value, I think, comes from the context it builds. I did not find any single chapter extraordinary, and quite a few seemed disappointing (this is not the fault of author Felipe Fernandez-Armesto -- after all, how can anyone adequately describe anti-Semitism or theories about the afterlife or the history of time in a mere two pages?). But together they formed a mosaic that from a distance gives a pretty good picture of current thought and where it came from.<br /><br />Nobody will become an expert -- real or otherwise -- at anything by reading this book. But  Mr. Fernandez-Armesto clearly is an expert, and I admit that his efficient and often opinionated writing does a good job at laying everything out in easy-to-understand terms.<br /><br />In the end, reading this book is a little like taking a spoonful of everything on a restaurant's menu in order to figure out what plates might be worth eating more of later. That sort of thing usually leaves me with heartburn, and rather than picking this volume up again I would prefer to refer to the original sources or, at worst, an encyclopedia. But for the world's enthusiastic skimmers, Ideas Than Changed the World is probably worth considering.	2004-09-28

After all, there isn't much compelling about Mr. Borges' life aside from his writing: he lived at home with his mother until she died when he was 75 years old, and he boasted about not venturing beyond his bedroom and his father's library for days at a time. Without a doubt, Mr. Borges' extremely original work is far more interesting than his seemingly unimaginative life.<br /><br />All that made for a challenging assignment for biographer Edwin Williamson, who pulled it off surprisingly well. Mr. Williamson certainly did his leg work: he apparently read everything Mr. Borges wrote short of his laundry lists, and he talked to scores of people who knew Mr. Borges when he was alive.<br /><br />But the most interesting parts of this book's 384 pages was still the examination of the literature, where Mr. Williamson convincingly reveals how much of the great writer's work was an elaborate code hiding his personal suffering coming from failed loves, and a feeling of inadequacy in regard to his mother, who all but worshipped the heroes of the Argentine independence movement in her family line.<br /><br />But that is about as close as Mr. Williamson comes to uncovering Mr. Borges' inner self. He could have come a bit closer had he not left out several important facts that must have been easy to come by: Mr. Borges' finally found love with former student Mar&iacute;a Kodama, who was many years younger than the writer. But Mr. Williamson doesn't tell us how much younger. Additionally, Mr. Borges' well-known and important (but puzzling) estrangement from his boyhood friend Adolfo Bioy Casares gets only a passing mention. And Mr. Borges' political naïvet&eacute; and confusion -- he called Argentina's dictatorship of the mid-1970s to the early 1980s a \\"necessary evil\\" and he turned his back on his native land by choosing to die in Switzerland -- is chronicled but not explained.<br /><br />It's difficult to judge how much of this is Mr. Williamson's fault. As one of the 20th century's most important and influential writers, Mr. Borges is clearly a worthy subject for a major biography. But the man's private life perhaps means that a worthy biography is impossible. Despite Mr. Williamson's noble effort, the best biography of the enigmatic Argentine may still be his collected works.s back on his native land by choosing to die in Switzerland -- is chronicled but not explained. <br /> <br />It's difficult to judge how much of this is Mr. Williamson's fault.

He is a complex and heavy-handed head of his household who is at once sympathetic and cruel.<br /><br />Most of the story is told before the actual appearance of the first white settlers, but their pending arrival hangs over the middle part of the book like a rain cloud. By the time it actually happens in the last 50 or so pages of the book, Okonkwo has been driven into exile, his life a shambles. He has only a slim hope of redemption, and that is shattered by the arrival of the settlers.<br /><br />Okonkwo's story is a relevant one even at a time when cultural and political imperialism has turned away from Africa toward the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. But more important than its relevance is its artistry: it is a deceptively simple epic tale somehow packed into just over 200 pages, and one of the most impressive first novels on record.

Wodehouse and Graham Greene's lighter efforts. In the book, Mr. Waugh points his razor wit toward the media, royalty, politics, warfare, and travel, all in the context of a fictional and fanciful war in the made-up Republic of Ishmaelia that is based on Italy's ill-fated war in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), which Mr. Waugh himself covered as a young reporter.<br /><br />His sharpest barbs are saved for his one-time profession, which he paints as being populated by lazy and back-stabbing prima donnas incapable of independent thought and more interested in style -- or at least the appearance of style -- than in substance. The bland Boot, the story's protagonist who is a decent enough fellow but a hopeless journalist, manages to get far closer to the truth than any of his colleagues but does so only by chance.<br /><br />Though the attitudes, language, and practices described in Scoop are more than a little dated, there is an element of truth in the picture Mr. Waugh paints of the Fourth Estate (as sad cases like the contemporary one involving one-time New York Times rising star Jayson Blair remind us). The descriptions are, however, greatly exaggerated: it is impossible to imagine a time when writers were sent into the field so poorly prepared, with unlimited expense accounts, and rewarded for sending in cryptic messages that are somehow turned into massive front-page reports. There is a slight element of sour grapes in Mr. Waugh's description of the newsgathering field he failed to excel in, something most obvious from the names he chooses for the fictional newspapers in the story (The Daily Beast, The Daily Brute, etc.).<br /><br />More importantly, like most popular satires, Scoop is really less about its subject matter than about comforting those who don't move in the same circles as the rich and powerful the book dismantles between its covers -- remember that these are the same people who were expected to buy this book when it was published in 1938. Even critics at that time recognized this in an as-a-matter-of-fact way, referring to Scoop as a comedy of errors Mr. Waugh dashed off to pay the bills between more weighty projects.<br /><br />But the most serious flaw of the book concerns the way the main character, Boot, evolves ... or fails to evolve. Characters are the cornerstone of any great story and even with a farce like Scoop (compare Boot to the bumbling Wormold in Mr. Greene's Our Man in Havana, another satire produced by a serious writer on a lark) the story is dramatically improved by illustrating the evolution of characters over the length of the narrative. But in Scoop, Boot returns home just the same as when he left. All of the characters, in fact, fail to change at all during the course of the story, with the possible exception of the compelling and shadowy Russian/Hungarian/Pole cum German love interest, K&auml;tchen -- not the best possible work from an author known for producing noteworthy personalities in his more noteworthy novels like Decline and Fall and Brideshead Revisited.he story (The Daily Beast, The Daily Brute, etc.).<br /><br />More importantly, like most popular satires, Scoop is really less about its subject matter than about comforting those who don't move in the same circles as the rich and powerful the book dismantles between its covers -- remember that these are the same people who were expected to buy this book when it was published in 1938.

The book even uses Mr. Vargas Llosa's preferred device of switching between narratives in alternating chapters as he did with such great success in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter and The Feast of the Goat, among others.<br /><br /> But in the end, I think, the story falls well short of those other two wonderful books, for a variety of reasons that left me puzzled.<br /><br /> First, I'll add my name to the chorus of reviewers who were left confused by Mr. Vargas Llosa's decision to pepper his narrative with second-hand comments from the book's two main characters (especially with Flora Trist&aacute;n, who seems to ask herself at least once every page something like &quot;but you could not have known that, could you, Flora?&quot;).<br /><br /> More importantly, the style of alternating chapters between the story of Ms. Trist&aacute;n, a 19th century social reformer, and her grandson Paul Gauguin, the painter, doesn't work nearly as well here as it does elsewhere. That is mostly because the two stories have very little to do with each other. Ms. Trist&aacute;n and Mr. Gauguin were related -- though they never met each other -- but aside from a few passing and insignificant comments by Mr. Gauguin about his grandmother, one story line never crossed. Are you interested in the story of Ms. Trist&aacute;n's epic battle to mobilize workers in France in the 1840s? Then read the odd-numbered chapters. Do you prefer the story of the famous painter of Tahiti and Tahitians around the turn of the 20th Century? Then skip the odd and read only the even-numbered installments.<br /><br /> The one common thread between the two narratives is hinted at in the title: in their own way, both Ms. Trist&aacute;n and Mr. Gauguin spend their lives trying to reach a certain kind of paradise. In the case of the former, it's through trying to create a kind of workers' paradise in which women and laborers are protagonists. In the case of the latter, it is through fleeing the closed art world of Paris in the 1880s for the paradise of Tahiti, where Mr. Gauguin felt the savage and pure soul of mankind was still bare to see. But in the end, all both characters find is frustration and, of course, death.<br /><br /> Days after finishing the book, it is both characters' deaths that stick with me the most. Mr. Vargas Llosa describes their physical declines with horrible consistency. The biting and consuming gut pains that crippled Ms. Trist&aacute;n upset my own stomach. And the periodic descriptions of the insects attracted to the foul-smelling puss dripping from Mr. Gauguin's syphilis sores more than once left a bitter scowl on my face.<br /><br /> Mr. Vargas Llosa does deserve kudos for the way he brings two distant and distinct historical characters to life, his second consecutive historical novel in which mounds of research make the actual history seem at once central and effortless. If you are a fan of Mr. Vargas Llosa's work, you'll no doubt find plenty to enjoy in The Way To Paradise. But to everyone else, I'd recommend one of the author's real top-shelf efforts.

In the early 1980s, the drama represented by the races -- both real and virtual -- between Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett were on par with the more or less contemporary rivalries between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, between Mohammed Ali and Joe Frazier, between Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe.<br /><br />As author Pat Butcher -- a fair middle distance runner in his own right -- points out, as with all great rivalries, the battles between Mr. Coe and Mr. Ovett attracted attention as much because of the athletes' personalities as because of their prodigious talents. Mr. Coe -- now Lord Coe -- was the refined and cultured middle class boy, compared to Mr. Ovett, the muscular and brash son of market trader.<br /><br />Based on his world record for 800 meters that lasted for an amazing 16 years and his successful defense of his 1500-meter title at the Los Angeles Olympics, Mr. Coe was probably the most successful of the two. But such comparisons are really not relevant with a rivalry like this one. These two men traded world records -- some of which stood for mere hours before the other crushed them half a continent away -- in a way that entranced any sports fan in the early 1980s. Each won the other's specialty at the Moscow Olympics in 1980, and Mr. Ovett once won 45 races in a row over nearly three years, a record unlikely to ever be duplicated at the highest level.<br /><br />As a high school and university-level middle distance runner at that time, the battles between these two great athletes had no small influence on me, which is why I decided to buy this book the moment I saw it. But the thing that pushes this volume over the top is the way Mr. Butcher interprets the men's dominance.<br /><br />Why has the drama of the middle distance never approached the pitch it had during Mr. Coe and Mr. Ovett's best years? Mr. Butcher points the finger at the two champions themselves.<br /><br />As someone who closely followed the sport 20 or more years ago, I was amazed to find that Messrs. Coe and Ovett raced each other only seven times in the 15-year span during which they were both active, and four of those were in Olympic finals. In addition to avoiding serious competition outside the biggest of races, they pioneered the use of professional pacemakers in world record attempts, a still-used strategy that harvested them a combined 17 world records but also turned the middle distances into a mechanical and predictable exercise that has virtually eliminated serious competition outside of the world championships and the Olympics.<br /><br />In the end, The Perfect Distance forced me to reconsider my romanticized view of the careers of these two great champions, which is in itself significant. It is an original effort, compellingly written, with an insider's understanding of the sport. And yet it remains accessible to the casual sports fan looking for some insights into what might be the most thrilling era in track and field since Roger Bannister and John Landy chased the magical four-minute-mile a generation earlier.

Without a doubt, this is the best available general resource source on papal histories, well referenced and organized with a no-nonsense writing style that makes it both an invaluable source of information for scholars and a fun book to just open to a random page and read.<br />The collection of papal mini-biographies here is the most complete I know of, including even the various anti-popes and the historically questionable Pope Joan. Where the available information is incomplete or contradictory, author, editor and researcher J.N.D. Kelly usually points that out. Other books give more information about specific aspects of the papacy, but none offers such a wide range of information between two compact covers.<br />My one complaint is a minor one: Mr. Kelly's judgments about what did and did not happen and who should and should not have been pope (regarding everything from Pope Joan and the anti-popes to conspiracy theories surrounding the unexpected death of Pope John Paul I in 1978) tend toward the official Vatican view more often than I'd like. But a book has to take some point of view, and if Mr. Kelly had done the opposite I'd probably be complaining now that he was a bit too antagonistic for my taste.<br />All in all, this is an irreplaceable resource for any theologian, religious scholar, or intellectually curious reader.	2004-07-19

I picked up Skinny Dip on a whim,  looking for a well-told but light story to read in the summer heat, and I was only partially rewarded.<br />The story does have its moments. The story's feckless antagonist,  a biologist called Chaz, is initially cast as a villain by explaining that he doesn't separate his papers and plastics for recycling. On the payroll of a rule-bending tycoon, Chaz fakes test results to mask fertilizer runoffs in the Florida Everglades and then he throws his wife over the side of the ship on an anniversary cruise to prevent her from discovering the deed. She survives only by grabbing onto a bale of marijuana that happened to be floating by, and vows to take revenge. It's not Ulysses, of course, but it was never met to be.<br />Where Skinny Dip falls short is in its pacing and its politics.<br />The poor rhythm of the tale comes from its length, which includes too many dead spots to make it the kind of page-turner it could have been with a more aggressive editor (see the lengthy and ultimately unsatisfying revenge plot of the cannabis-hugging wife).<br />And the politically correct characterizations -- however admirable they might seem at first -- are in the end tiring. Mr. Hiaasen seems more than a little earnest in the moral undertones he creates. The book's obvious environmental subplot, the use of a character who vows to never misuse the services of illegal aliens again, a host of smiling good guys who never drink and who will their assets to charity -- it's enough to make it seems like the obvious lessons and not the narrative are the point of the book.

It's not even about a man and all the dimensions that implies. It's about a great cyclist. Now, is that good or bad?

And the story from pop music icon Madonna isn't bad either.<br />Which is a way of saying that I think the real star of this book is Russian illustrator Gennadii Spirin, who manages to create a magical eastern European world of fanciful architecture and fashion and dreamlike snowy settings using mostly color washings and a trusty No. 2 pencil. The five- and seven-year-old children I read the story to already knew the book before I arrived, and it was the illustrations and not the story that had them giggling in delight.<br />That said, the story itself is pretty good. Madonna's writing style is crisp and fresh -- probably something she developed by writing some of the world's best-known pop songs over the last generation. She seems very comfortable in her role as a storyteller, at least until the last pages, when the story becomes rushed in order to tie everything up while making sure that the moral isn't lost on its diminutive audience. But the kids didn't seem to mind that.<br />The story is about a fellow called Yakov, a village cobbler with a sickly child. When the traditional medicine and the town's wisest elder all fail to help the poor boy, Yakov turns to a cast of characters whose names give a clue to their morals: Ivan the Arsonist, for example, or Vladimir the Villain. The boy is miraculously cured. The point is that we've all got a little bit of Vladimir the Villain in us, and if we are bold enough to admit that and fight these dark tendencies, well, then anything is possible.<br />I am no expert about contemporary children's books, but the moral seems a bit more religious than Mother Goose and the Grimm's Fairytales I grew up with. Again that's a likely reflection on the author, who is famously devoted to Kabbalah, a kind of Jewish mysticism. Fortunately, it is the philosophy's moral values and not its mysticism that shines through.<br />Using the old schoolhouse grading system, I'd call it a sold B -- good enough to consider buying for children in the appropriate age group, but not quite good enough to stop you from wondering if you'd even be thinking about it if it had not been written by one of the world's most recognized popular culture figures.ues and not its mysticism that shines through.<br />Using the old schoolhouse grading system, I'd call it a sold B -- good enough to consider buying for children in the appropriate age group, but not quite good enough to stop you from wondering if you'd even be thinking about it if it had not been written by one of the world's most recognized popular culture figures.	2004-06-29

But I refer to it and re-read parts of it periodically, even though the years appear to have dampened some of my enthusiasm for this brick of a book.<br /><br />The more I think about Ulysses, the more I decide that most of the value of reading and understanding the book (two very different things, by the way) comes from its ambition and the impact it has had on 20th century literature. This is the work that -- probably to the chagrin of literature students everywhere -- more or less invented the stream of consciousness style of literature, and which literary historians say marked the start of the modern era in English literature. The narrative, a nearly 800-page examination into the events in Leopold Bloom's life on June 16, 1904, is dense but also very compelling, and the language is often crisp and colorful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the language is even more often a bizarre maze of metaphors, references, and descriptions so inaccessible that some scholars think they may contain some kind of secret code. At one point, the erotic and deflating soliloquy of Molly Bloom (Leopold's wife) takes up something like 25,000 words unmarred by a single punctuation mark -- a section long enough to be published separately as a novella.<br /><br />Without a doubt, a similar book written today by an unknown talent would never find its way the shelves of the neighborhood Books-A-Million without first shedding 300 or 400 pages under the red ink of some unfortunate editor. There's also little doubt that the modern literary cannon is better off for the fact that that didn't happen when Mr. Joyce produced this seminal work. Readers are also better off, but only the ones willing to work at it.when Mr. Joyce produced this seminal work. Readers are also better off, but only the ones willing to work at it.	2004-06-16

But almost nobody has been willing to read this unlikely best seller and then write a review that ignores the lessons about punctuation the book focuses on. That in itself offers strong proof about its value.<br />Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a charming book and an unusual success story, and I applaud it for bringing to the fore a debate about the aspect of our language that has suffered most from its inundation under a sea of Internet chat and cellular text messaging. Using a mix of humor and anecdotes, author and journalist Lynne Truss manages to create a highly readable and enjoyable primer that not only explains how punctuation works but why it is important.<br />If you have any doubt, witness the sentence: \\"A woman without her man is nothing.\\" Now add two lonely punctuation marks and the meaning is turned on its head: \\"A woman: without her, man is nothing.\\" The title of the book is another example -- it is supposed to be a description of the diet of pandas, but because of poor punctuation it sounds more like a complaint about a murderous dinner guest.<br />Fair warning: American readers might have problems with some of Ms. Truss's vocabulary (a \\"fag\\" is a cigarette in England; \\"rubbers\\" are erasers), and her statements about placing all punctuation marks outside quotation marks and the frequency with which she uses Britishisms like \\"actually\\" and \\"obviously\\" will stand out to readers already comfortable with their grip on grammar and punctuation. A lot of those problems could have been eliminated by putting the manuscript in the hands of a thoughtful editor before releasing it in the United States.<br />I also have a problem with treating punctuation as an end rather than as a means to an end. I think anyone who writes even a grocery list while trying to remember thousands of often archaic and obscure rules could starve to death before they ever make it to the supermarket. The ultimate goal should be to make the writer's intent clear. Punctuation is simply a tool to that end.thousands of often archaic and obscure rules could starve to death before they ever make it to the supermarket.

But while I and many others might complain that the new king of the cable television wars sins by appealing to the lowest common denominator, it is also clear that it has -- for good or for bad -- reinvented a sector less than a decade after arch-rival CNN invented it.<br />While the title of this book might imply that it focuses mostly on the seven-year history of Fox news, it is really about the evolution of the sector as a whole. Well documented is Fox's blatant disregard for conventions most journalists consider (or considered) beyond reproach -- above all the value of objectivity and a healthy suspicion of institutions -- but  the central argument is how it forced its values on rivals CNN and MSNBC, the well-funded joint venture between Microsoft and NBC.<br />The book is an accessible read, well researched, objective in its take on the subject (author Scott Collins works for the Los Angeles Times, and not one of the three main players in the sector), and packed with enough information to even satisfy people in the business.<br />But despite all that, I think it also misses the real spark behind Fox's rise. Mr. Collins' central argument can be boiled down to a 1995 Times Mirror poll he cites that reported that while 40 percent of Americans said they were politically conservative only 5 percent of journalists did. Fox, he argues, rose up to compensate for that lopsidedness.<br />While that is no doubt relevant, I think it is also a simplification. I see the main difference between the pre-Fox and post-Fox worlds of news coverage not as one between circumstances in which conservatives did not have a voice and one in which they do, but instead a story about a society that is losing its empathy, its tolerance for opposing views. The arguments for why that took place are best left for another day, but if one accepts the point it becomes clear that Fox is not a cause but a symptom.accepts the point it becomes clear that Fox is not a cause but a symptom.	2004-05-29

For example, the queen piece evolved from the vizier (a bearded male piece that was like an anemic bishop, able to move only one diagonal space in any direction), who stood next to the king in one form or another for five centuries before the queen definitively appeared. Even then, the evolution was not universal: several games using the hapless vizier are still played in the Middle East, and the game most folks now know as chess is in some cultures still called &quot;queen's chess,&quot; treating it as a derivative of some lost standard version of the game. The first chess queen appears in the 10th or 11th century, and it seems to have taken her around 300 years to accumulate the power she has today.<br />But more interesting -- even if somewhat unconvincing -- than a mere collection of trivia are Ms. Yalom's theories about why this evolution took place the way it did. I was thrilled by her research to uncover what she calls &quot;missing link&quot; pieces, chess pieces no longer used but that played an intermediate role between the original colored lumps that the Moors played the game with when they arrived in Spain the eighth century (the Koran doesn't allow the depiction of living creatures) to the six distinct pieces used today. She find the mention of the queen piece in a late 10th century Swiss manuscript, what appear to be 11th century ivory queens in Italy, and a distinctly female face on a queen a century later in Spain. She writes that the queen was able to give the vizier the boot thanks to the rising status of women in medieval Europe, the same period when the Virgin Mary started to play more than a bit role in the church's teachings.<br /><br />Ms. Yalom comes up with other examples to support the idea, some well known and some less well known. She mentions the 10th century Spanish royal Toda de Navarre who went to war to install her grandson on the throne; Urraca de Galicia, who divorced her husband, King Alfonso I, and then defeated him in battle; Spain's Queen Isabella, whose support sent Christopher Colombus to the New World and whose resolve sent the same Moors who brought chess to Europe back to North Africa, where they've remained; Adelaide de Bourgogne, who later became Holy Roman empress; and Matilda di Toscana, who famously led troops into battle on horseback. But while I found this role call of powerful and iconoclastic women interesting, I was ultimately unconvinced by Ms. Yalom's argument: these women spanned too long a period and were too dissimilar to appear to be any more than fascinating historical anomalies, which is just what I think the queen chess piece is likely to be.<br />By the end, I began to wonder if the book was written for a female audience, or at minimum an audience already interested in gender issues. That is only because many of Ms. Yalom's points seem thinly supported ... probably supported enough for a&quot;me too&quot; crowd, but often insufficient for more skeptical readers like me. The book would also make an interesting read for chess players, which is why I picked it up in the first place. Of course, it might be doubly interesting for female chess players -- but Ms. Yalom points out that there aren't as many people in that category as one would hope: despite the gender of the game's most powerful piece only around 5 percent of chess players are women.a &quot;me too&quot; crowd, but often insufficient for more skeptical readers like me.

The horrible centerpiece of the book is the 1984 case of a two fundamentalist Mormon brothers who brutally murdered their sister in law and her infant daughter; and the context comes from the colorful description of the Mormon church's first decades, when violence apparently became a cornerstone of the faith. But the undercurrent is about the place of religion in America -- a theme that comes to a head during the murder trial of the Lafferty boys.<br /><br />In justifying their unspeakable crime, the Laffertys claimed they were acting on direct orders from God, who told them that the two victims were standing in the way of His plans. Attorneys developed an insanity defense, claiming -- not unreasonably -- that anyone who believes such an \\"order\\" could not be sane. But the book points out that so-called normal religious people believe many things that don't stand to objective reasoning: the virgin birth, for example, or the transformation of bread into the body of Christ. Are these people insane as well? If not, who decides what religious beliefs are rational and which are not? And if there is no objective standard to judge these things by, does that amount to a sanction of atrocious acts committed by would-be messiahs like the Laffertys?<br /><br />A more or less similar story could have been written about any number of other ghastly crimes (author Jon Krakauer mentions several in passing in Under the Banner of Heaven), and the Mormon church by no means has a monopoly on violent histories. But Mr. Krakauer does make a compelling and highly readable case that the basic beliefs of Mormons (e.g., the church's historical reliance on violence, its love-hate relationship with polygamy and government authority, and the belief that every member can receive direct revelations from God) make this sort of event more common. And he certainly tells the story of the Laffertys in a way that will keep readers turning the pages even as they shake their heads in disbelief.<br /><br />Several of my fellow reviewers have dismissed this book as anti-Mormon propaganda, and after reading it I can certainly understand why it is not a best-seller in Salt Lake City. But I cannot have an opinion about how subjective the book might be since I am far from being an expert on Mormon history. Until now, my views of the church had been shaped by bits of information I'd been taught in U.S. history classes, a single trip through heavily Mormon northern Utah, the glossy public relations campaigns from the mainstream church, and a small handful of interactions with Mormons over the years.<br /><br />But what is clear is that Mr. Krakauer did an extraordinary amount of research to produce this book. He weaves together stories of dozens of historical and contemporary Mormon families in far-flung outposts of the American west, Mexico, and Canada, mixed in with historical records, news accounts, and Mormon doctrine. Other non-fiction writers would do well to read Under the Banner of Heaven if for no other reason than to understand how important going through a good bit of shoe leather plays in producing a memorable work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some simple and mostly cosmetic steps could have made this book much better.<br /><br />As one would guess, a story with so many characters is bound to be a little confusing. But Mr. Krakauer makes it more so, alternately refering to major players in the book by their first and last names. As a result, Mormon church founder Joseph Smith and modern-day polygamist Alex Joseph are both puzzlingly referred to as \\"Joseph\\" -- and other similar examples abound. Also, the sheer number of Laffertys, Lees, Batemans, Blackmores, Johnsons, and Smiths featured in the book might make some kind of family tree printed on the inside covers helpful, though I suppose that given all the instances of church members marrying their cousins or step-daughters could mean that such a diagram would have to exist in three dimensions.<br /><br />Then there is the annoying problem of footnotes. It is true that adding a bit of information from outside the narrative can add another layer of complexity to a story. But in this case the use of footnotes is too often used to simply explain who a person is, which could simply be added to the narrative; or to explain that legal rights to reprint a given passage had been dutifully obtained, something would could have easily been relegated to the end of the book. Some pages have as much information in their footnotes as in the main text, and when the information found there is superfluous, it interrupts the flow of the narrative and creates the impression that Mr. Krakauer is trying too hard to impress, like a kid in school who sits in front and raises his hand even before the teacher finishes asking the question.

But while it is mostly a forward-looking effort from the sadly puzzling historian and author Niall Ferguson, I find it most frightening when it looks to the past. It's in those parts of his thesis that Mr. Ferguson argues, for example, that the U.S. should have dropped as many as 50 atom bombs on China in order to end the Korean War quickly and neatly, and where he opines that the Vietnam War should have been fought even more ruthlessly starting back in the mid-1960s, as a way to snap the North's resolve.<br />It was all enough to compel me to temporarily close Colossus with a scowl and a wrinkled brow to reach for the comfort of a dusty old volume containing he works of Tacitus, the first and second century Roman historian who Mr. Ferguson no doubt knows far better than I do. Tacitus, best known for his opinions about the throne's power to corrupt and the scandals and ruined lives its corruption produced, famously wrote about Domitian's reign of terror: &quot;They made a desert and called it victory.&quot;<br />Evidently, if Mr. Ferguson had his way, the desert would stretch far beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. He backed the controversial U.S. war effort in Iraq from its first rumblings, criticizing it only where it has paused to reassess or deny its imperial designs when that time could have been used to forcefully to indiscriminately crush resistance (or anything that appears to be resistance ... or that might evolve into resistance). He argues for a U.S. foreign policy along the lines of that employed by imperial Britain, endeavoring to win the Middle East's hearts and minds by ruling their pocketbooks and politics.<br />If these dangerous points had been made by almost anyone else, I would have stopped reading after 30 or 40 pages and dismissed the writer as a crackpot. But I grew to know Mr. Ferguson through the Pity of War and The House of Rothschild -- not books that swayed me with every argument, but which were full of worthwhile, uncommon, meaty, and complex theories that forced me more than once to dramatically reconsider what I believed. And while last year's troubling effort Empire now seems like a kind of uncomfortable preface to Colossus, it had been easy for me until now to dismiss that book as an aberration. So I returned to Colossus after a short break and finished its 400 pages, sadly shaking my head almost the whole time.<br />Without a doubt, Mr. Ferguson is a talented writer with a stunning command of information and historical context. He writes compellingly and with great enthusiasm, more so in Colossus than in his earlier work. But it appears to me to be sorely misdirected here: he fails to convince that the U.S. has the power to develop the kind of empire he describes and, more importantly, he fails to explain why it should even try to do so. I get the idea that without many decades of time to provide context to what he writes about, Mr. Ferguson loses almost all of the edge that previously made him stand out among his contemporaries.<br />Sigh. I don't know what sparked this apparent evolution in Mr. Ferguson's interests, but I can only hope that it doesn't get around.hich were full of worthwhile, uncommon, meaty, and complex theories that forced me more than once to dramatically reconsider what I believed.

But you'd never know that based on most of what's written on the subject: most literature on the subject tends to treat discussions of the global economy in black-and-white terms. Authors, essayists, and columnists too often rely on gimmicky strategies that pull on the heartstrings but do little to examine the real pros and cons of an increasingly global world, focusing more on what's wrong than on what can be done. And discussion I've seen too often takes too narrow a view -- life in a particular village, the impact on a specific industry -- for a well-rounded debate to take shape.<br />In Defense of Globalization is the first effort I've seen in a long time that manages to avoid most of those pitfalls, relying on objective and unemotional discussions of evidence rather than anecdotes, and presenting its arguments in a straightforward and gimmick-free way. It is full of important information and still eminently readable.<br />Opponents of globalization usually base their arguments against the international market economy on a few strong points: that it encourages child labor, that it erodes democracy, that it weakens the plight of women in the developing world, that it kills local cultures, and that it harms the environment. In this book, scholar and author Jagdish Bhagwati addresses each of those issues in a series of chapters that make up the heart of the book.<br />But globalization proponents will not find in In Defense of Globalization a blind defense of their views. Mr. Bhagwati takes the anti-globalization points seriously. He goes so far as to show that he shares many of the anti-globalists' views and values (especially regarding poverty), and he points out many areas where unchecked global capitalism has the potential to do more harm than good. This makes the book much more effective than it would have been otherwise.<br />But despite all that, Mr. Bhagwati still sees free trade as the best was to raise incomes and speed up the long-term development of the world's poorest economies, and he compellingly illustrates why any kind of trade protection -- no matter how noble its intent -- in the end leaves the protected and the protected against worse off. And unlike many efforts of this kind, it doesn't simply stop at pointing out what's wrong -- it offers many options for improving the current situation.<br />In the end, In Defense of Globalization is not aimed at partisans on either side of the globalization debate if what they are looking for is information to back up what they already believe. This is a book will make anyone who thinks much about globalization think again ... and perhaps realize they share more than they thought with the opposite side.he book much more effective than it would have been otherwise.<br />But despite all that, Mr. Bhagwati still sees free trade as the best was to raise incomes and speed up the long-term development of the world's poorest economies, and he compellingly illustrates why any kind of trade protection -- no matter how noble its intent -- in the end leaves the protected and the protected against worse off.

Still, I'm not sure I could have guessed that I'd enjoy it quite as much as I did.<br />Mr. Abt's keen eye and feel for words rarely produce spectacular results but they almost always capture the heart of the subject they are examining. What I didn't expect was the way reading all of these essays as a collection would work together to create a larger picture, the way that some talented designers can take a collection of paintings or magazine covers and organize them in such a way that they create a unique portrait when viewed from an appropriate distance.<br />The portrait this collection produces spans a 25-year period that starts with the tail end of the career of Eddy Merckx, cycling's Babe Ruth (if I can be permitted a baseball analogy...), and ending well into the era of its latest star, Lance Armstrong, the sport's Hank Aaron (...or maybe two of them). In between, all of the giants of the sport -- Greg LeMond, Miguel Indurain, Francesco Moser, Sean Kelly, Claudio Ciapucci, Laurent Fignon, Bernard Hinault, Chris Boardman, Jan Ullrich, Mario Cipollini, and the recently deceased Marco Pantani -- are presented as Mr. Abt saw them at the time, and not with the sometimes distorting benefit of hindsight. Add to that a host of profiles of other would-be champions, flash-in-the-pan talents, and colorful racers and you have a collection of articles that belongs on any cycling fan's bookshelf.<br />The photography, unfortunately, is not what it could be considering the talent of photojournalist Graham Watson and the photogenic nature of the sport. Unless Mr. Watson inexplicably withheld the cr&egrave;me of his personal collection, I can only blame this on some nameless editor who ran great photos too small, and who skipped what must have been some extraordinary shots from Mr. Watson's portfolio in lieu of some rather ordinary alternatives. But the writing is the real reason to buy Off to the Races, so don't let the unexceptional choice of photos cause you to miss this highly enjoyable volume.rom Mr. Watson's portfolio in lieu of some rather ordinary alternatives.

Suffice it to say that this one -- written with collaborator John Tierney-- has the same crisp writing, the same kinds of unusual story lines and plot twists, the same kinds of colorful characters that made Mr. Buckley's other novels wonderful examples of worthwhile light reading.<br />In this story, a failed investment banker becomes a monk and in the incarnation of Brother Ty, he somehow becomes a catalyst in the ethically flawed rebirth of the monastery's wine. The story is a satire that takes aim at self-help books, but as someone raised Catholic (and practically living in the shadow of the Vatican), a former financial journalist, and a wine lover ... well, a story line that among other things takes aim at the Holy See, Wall Street, and Napa Valley hit close to home in too many ways for me not to love it.	2004-04-28
US	52000975	RPKB91B2V9DQV	1582342903	972545783	The Rider	Books	4	28	28	N	N	The Writer	Cycling holds a unique niche in the world of sports. It is a delicate balance between rider and machine, between strength and tactics, between the individual and the team, between man and the elements. Anyone who has ever ridden seriously knows that almost any serious ride is an epic journey, an endless series of choices and possibilities, of suffering and pleasure.<br />To date, I have read nothing that captures the real essence of that experience nearly as well as Tim Krabb&eacute;'s The Rider, which was originally published in 1978 in Amsterdam and which appeared in English only in 2002. Like a racing bike that has been relieved off all excess weight and trimmed of anything that could increase resistance against the wind, The Rider is prose in its most basic and stripped down form. There is hardly a wasted or misplaced word here: the writing is crisp, powerful, efficient, and compelling.<br />The little book weighs in at just 148 pages, just a little more than one for each of the 137 kilometers of the Tour de Mont Aigoual, by all rights a nondescript semi-pro bicycle race through the rolling mountains of C&eacute;vennes, in south central France. It may not sound like much, but Mr. Krabb&eacute; breathes life into it by describing perfectly what goes on inside a racer's head: everything from relevant glimpses at strategy -- in addition to being a strong rider and an even better writer, Mr. Krabb&eacute; may be best known as a chess champion, and his eye for tactics and detail shows -- to interesting thoughts about his own athletic career, about philosophy, fantasy, his competitors, and fascinating memories from cycling history.<br />The book is set in the 1970s, a time that will seem quaint to riders who have become interested in the sport only over the last few years: a period when riders made decisions about strategy rather than have it radioed into their ear pieces, when leather straps and not titanium clips held the shoes to the pedals, and when riders packed half an orange and a few figs in their pockets to fuel the ride rather than the latest scientific miracle mix.<br />I found it all exhilarating. As I leafed through my copy of the book earlier in order to double check a few facts before writing this review, I found myself happily re-reading some of the more compelling passages. While I was doing so, two (non-cyclist) friends stopped by and I read out loud to them Mr. Krabb&eacute;'s dramatic account of Charley Gaul's stunning victory in the 1956 Giro d'Italia ... and they were unimpressed.<br />Which brings me to why I withheld one star from what I think is an excellent book: its appeal is far from universal. Unless you are a rider -- or at the very least, a serious fan of the sport or very close to someone who is a rider -- then I think it will be difficult to appreciate the discussions of the nervousness that accompanies a rapid descent from the mountains or the thought that goes into choosing the right gears.<br />But if you are a serious (or semi- or formerly-serious) rider, I can't imagine that you wouldn't be as thrilled by this book as I was.<br />If you do get a copy, my one piece of &quot;strategic&quot; advice would be to keep careful track of the names Mr. Krabb&eacute; mentions, famous and otherwise: to an English speaker's ear, many may sound quite similar. In addition to Mr. Krabb&eacute; himself we meet riders called Kl&eacute;ber, Koblet, Coppi, Caput, K&uuml;bler, and Clemons. And don't even get me started on the mouthful that many Dutch names represent to non-natives.

What's next? A comedic treatment of domestic abuse or drug addiction?<br />Whatever it is, based on the two efforts of Mr. Buckley I have read so far, it is bound to be an entertaining and intelligent. This time around, Mr. Buckely sets up fictional circumstances that hilariously skewer the scandals surrounding Bill and Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Barbara Streisand, Johnny Cochran and OJ Simpson, Marc Rich, Monica Lewinsky, and the American legal system. Don't be surprised to find yourself laughing, loudly and often.<br />A friend of mine calls this kind of book a \\"warm shower\\" -- it's nice when you're in it, he says, but the good feeling doesn't last long once you step out onto the bathmat. It's a characterization I can't deny, but I'll say that this warm shower is better than most. It won't force you to ask yourself important questions, and it won't affect the way you see the world. But as an easy-to-read story that manages to keep the pages turning without insulting anyone's intelligence, it's hard to beat.	2004-03-27

Mr. Baker has a gift for capturing the essence of habits, thoughts, reactions, and objects that are so small, so insignificant that most people don't ever notice them ... and yet when Mr. Baker puts them on the page, he gets it just right.<br />None of the half dozen of so books I've read from Mr. Baker sound like much when the plots are summarized, and that is certainly the case with The Fermata. The book's story line is based on the ability of the 35-year-old narrator Arno Strine to somehow stop time, and most of the pages are used up with explorations of how he decides what he can and can't do while time is stopped.<br />The unimpressive story line means that the value of the book depends almost entirely on Mr. Baker's ability to keep the prose engaging. Sometimes it doesn't work (as with his more recent effort Box of Matches) and sometimes it works well, as with The Fermata. As always, what holds it together when it works is Mr. Baker's memory for trivia, his intelligence, and his eye for detail: witness the title: &quot;Fermata,&quot; the noun form of the word &quot;stop&quot; in Italian, is also a musical term that means holding a note longer than the time value -- a perfect name for a book with this kind of plot.<br />Ultimately, my criticism of The Fermata is one shared by all of Mr. Baker's books and all literature based on prose rather than memorable plots or characters. In my mind, they're like the old clich&eacute; about Chinese food, which tastes great but leaves you hungry a few hours later. In the case of this book, the prose keeps the pages turning, but when you're through, very little of it sticks with you.	2004-03-12
US	52000975	R3FJSQNBZIACAE	0811839060	183124333	Tour de France/Tour de Force Updated and Revised 100-Year Anniversary Edition	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A matter of context	The 100th anniversary edition of the Tour de France/Tour de Force is a little hard to characterize. The volume's size and emphasis on photography make it seem like coffee table book, and yet the ambitious if not comprehensive text examining 100 years of history of the world's greatest bicycle race make it appear to be something of a reference resource.<br />That's not necessarily a good thing, because when something tries to do too much, it often ends up doing what it does badly. In the case of this book, &quot;badly&quot; may be too strong -- but it does leave something to be desired.<br />Much of the period between the wars are glossed over, for example, and the quality of the photography is uneven. The characterization of some riders (most notably, five-time champion Jacques Anquetil) can be a little patronizing, and the introduction by three-time winner Greg LeMond seems way off the mark (evidently, Mr. LeMond thought  the assignment was to subjectively recount his victories rather than record his view of the Tour as a whole -- the second introduction by gifted cycling journalist Samuel Abt is much better, and the discussion of Mr. LeMond's career in the main part of the book is a fairer treatment of it).<br />But despite those faults, I find I still enjoy this book a great deal. Maybe it's a soft spot in my heart for this kind of history: to read that riders for many years sipped on champagne and puffed on cigarettes for energy, that the first Tour's riders rode more than 250 miles a day (albeit for one week rather than three), that they had to dismount their bikes to change gears by hand, and that the winning riders were once on their bikes for nearly 250 hours during the span of the race (compared to less than 100 hours in most modern editions). And while I was puzzled by the selection of some photos (several just show groups of unidentified riders from different points in the race's history), the best shots are very, very good.<br />In the end, the strong point of the book is the context it provides. For die-hard cycling fans, any book of this scope holds a certain attraction. But the case is more compelling when it comes to more recent cycling fans, many of whom came to the sport only after Lance Armstrong started his amazing string of Tour de France victories in 1999. For them, a book like this provides an invaluable way to understand the sport better and to meet the ghosts of the past champions Mr. Armstrong will ultimately be measured against.int of the book is the context it provides.

But painting an accurate picture of a place is one thing, and grumbling under one's breath is rather something else.<br /><br />Yet with The Stones of Florence one can almost imagine Ms. McCarthy's scowl as she rails against other writers who write about Florence, about the tourists who visit the city, the traffic on its streets, and the smog that surrounds it. Although modern environmental laws have improved the air quality in Florence in the years since this book was written in 1964, the city has become an ever more popular subject for writers, the traffic has worsened, and the crowds of tourists have grown larger and less cosmopolitan ... I shudder to imagine what Ms. McCarthy would write today.<br /><br />In my eyes, most of the book's value comes from the fact that it is considered one of the parents of modern travel writing, a blend of history, literature, autobiography, and intelligence gathering. For students of the genre, this would probably make an interesting read. But for anyone thinking of reading this ahead of a long-awaited trip to the storied Tuscan capital, I dare say that seeing the city first from Ms. McCarthy's often jaded point of view could color the experience in an undesirable way.	2004-03-06

Wade Rowland, author of Galileo's Mistake, certainly doesn't have much faith in conventional wisdom.<br />Most people were taught that the conflict between Galileo Galilei and the Vatican was the last gasp of the Age of Faith before it gave way to the Age of Reason -- a view seemingly supported by the church itself, which in 1992 officially admitted it had wronged Galileo. But it is Mr. Rowland's contention that the venerable mathematician and astronomer was not a casualty of a revengeful and backward church but instead a victim of historical circumstances and his own lack of tact.<br />Mr. Rowland notes, for example, that the church never bothered Nicolaus Copernicus, who proved mathematically that the earth rotated around the sun more than 20 years before Galileo was even born and nearly a century before Galileo's famous summons to Rome.<br />The difference, of course, is that between what Copernicus said in 1543 and what Galileo was told in 1632, Rome experienced the full brunt of the protestant reformation and responded with its own counter-reformation: the Holy See could no longer afford dissent that that kind. Those are the historical circumstances.<br />Galileo's lack of tact, his \\"mistake\\" as Mr. Rowland puts it, is more complicated. While Copernicus presented his views in the Latin \\"De Revolutionibus,\\" Galileo made his mark with \\"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany\\" which was written in Italian, a vulgar street language at the time. More importantly, where Copernicus released his proofs on his deathbed and to a largely academic community, a Galileo just past middle age touted to a wider audience that his proof showed that the scientific method was clearly superior to the Bible as a way to understand the universe. And lastly, while the church warned Galileo to stop his promotion of the scientific method in 1616, Galileo came back to it just 16 years later when he published \\"Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems,\\" where he ostensibly explained both sides of the heliocentric-geocentric debate but made no mistake about which side made most sense in his mind. The Vatican, Mr. Rowland states, had no option but to call Galileo to Rome.<br />It is when it describes the circumstances Galileo's trial rather than the circumstances of the theological debate that this book is most interesting. Like the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial  or the case against Rosa Parks in 1955, Galileo's trial was about rules being broken and not about whether the rules were right or wrong. In that light, Mr. Rowland writes that a narcissistic Galileo was clearly guilty of breaking the rules set out by an embattled and desperate church -- a church that showed its leniency by placing Galileo under house arrest rather than burning him at the stake as was common at the time.<br />To make his points, Mr. Rowland uses fictionalized dialogue and he creates situations where he takes certain liberties to fill in the gaps between what is known as fact, and for its part, the writing flows easily (revealing Mr. Rowland's journalistic background). But for all that, Galileo's Mistake remains a thought provoking and interesting but ultimately unpersuasive book. The traditional view of Galileo's trial is surely not without fault, but the evidence that it is almost completely wrong seems too flimsy to believe, even after 300 pages of explanations ... no matter how interesting they might be.both sides of the heliocentric-geocentric debate but made no mistake about which side made most sense in his mind.

I didn't read Medea when I was in school, but I have now read through this slim tragedy twice over the last month, and the more I think about it the more I find the story line and its captivating protagonist fascinating and current.<br />Before opening the play, my knowledge of Medea had been limited to the occasional reference to it in news reports involving infanticide -- not something that made me eager to read the original.<br />Though Medea does take the lives of her children in a twisted revenge plot, it would be a serious mistake to consider that unforgettable act the central part of the play. Instead, it is Medea's evolution that is most important.<br />Despite the fact that she gave up her life to follow Jason, Medea is revealed as a kind of proto-feminist early on in the story, a woman defined more by cleverness than by rage ... and yet never seeming merely cunning or calculating. Sadly, this kind of dominating and complex female character would be somewhat unusual by the standards of popular literature today; she must have been exceptionally remarkable in the day of Euripedes, the play's author.<br />The tragedy itself indicates this kind of reversal in several ways, ranging from the manner in which Creon reacts to Medea in their conversation near the end of the story to the way the chorus makes mention of streams flowing upwards in the mountains.<br />But for all its value, Medea does not stand on its own. Readers must know what ancient Greek audiences already knew: that Medea sacrificed everything, including her life in her home country, to help Jason win the treasured Golden Fleece and to mother his children. But soon she is abandoned in favor of a woman of more noble birth, which is where the play begins. This edition -- not the play itself -- loses a star for failing to explain that context in what could have been a very brief but invaluable introduction.	2004-02-18

He was talking, of course, about repeating as champion of the Tour de France after his stunning victory in 1999. But he could have just as well been apologizing in advance for this rushed and poorly organized effort, Mr. Armstrong's second autobiography after the inspiring and hugely popular volume It's Not About the Bike.<br />I am puzzled by the sloppiness of this book, unless it was hurried along in order to have it in bookstores in time for the holidays. Whatever the reason, readers who found this book in their stockings were treated to two spellings for the name of Mr. Armstrong's colorful teammate, Floyd Landis/Landes, and were told twice within the span of one paragraph that riders would not leave the mountains until the final three days of the 2002 Tour.<br />More importantly, the narrative drifts wildly in terms of what it is trying to do. At points the aim seems to be telling Mr. Armstrong's side of his failed marriage or the constant drug testing he must undergo. Sometimes Mr. Armstrong tells us that just finishing an grueling event like the Tour de France is an accomplishment, and later he says that he'll quit the moment he realizes that he can't win. He tries to take ammunition away from critics who think he's a hothead or too self centered. A few times, Mr. Armstrong even puts on his philosopher's cap and opines about politics, love, Sept, 11, the duties of public figures like himself, or the notion that everyone ought to adopt a cause.<br />By trying to be almost everything, Every Second Counts risks being about nothing. It's the same problem that befalls many singers who have big hits on their first records, or championship teams that disappoint a year later. Luckily for cycling fans, the same thing didn't happen to Mr. Armstrong on the bike, where, through 2003 at least, he maintained the hunger and strength necessary to overcome what must have been an enormous and growing temptation to rest on his laurels and enjoy what he accomplished.<br />And that brings us to one of the two main things that are right about this book. Every Second Counts is clearly at its best where Mr. Armstrong is most passionate: the parts dealing with riding and racing, and those dealing with his own recovery from cancer and his work with other cancer victims.<br />Even with the help of an accomplished journalist like Sally Jenkins, Mr. Armstrong has never come across as much of a writer, but when his passion shines through that hardly matters. He would have been much better off if he had simply stayed with what he knows best and cares most about. Oh, yes, and found a better copy editor.he maintained the hunger and strength necessary to overcome what must have been an enormous and growing temptation to rest on his laurels and enjoy what he accomplished.<br />And that brings us to one of the two main things that are right about this book.

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	35	38	N	N	Half valuable, completely disturbing	The Price of Loyalty is really two books in one. The first part concentrates on painting a flattering picture of its main subject, former Treasury Secretary and Alcoa Chairman Paul O'Neill. This part is at times gratingly predictable, painting a picture of Mr. O'Neill as a maverick genius, the only member of President George W. Bush's inner circle with the awareness and valor to point out that the emperor has no clothes. The second part, which is much more interesting and important, points out that -- at least the way Mr. O'Neill tells the tale -- the emperor indeed has no clothes.<br />I was briefly tempted to suggest that every American ought to read this book before voting in the upcoming election, but I won't because I think that its credibility is strained by the many times the two main themes of the book overlap. It is hard to avoid doubts about whether certain episodes are told with the goal of painting the preordained picture of Mr. O'Neill, the hero, or of Mr. Bush, the heel. I don't see it as a matter of honesty or dishonesty, but more of the kind of filter Mr. O'Neill passed information through and what might or might not make it through.<br />Still, it's a worthwhile read: even though it weighs in at more than 350 pages, it is a fast and compelling read.<br />More importantly, if even half of the convincing anecdotes -- about juggling budget numbers in national addresses, of disregarding evidence that would make war in Iraq more difficult to justify, of the way the Grand Old Party has been hijacked by its most Machiavellian wing -- are true, then there is a lot we should be worrying about. And though the White House has cast Mr. O'Neill's views as sour grapes from the highest level figure to have left the administration to date, there is little reason to doubt the statements and archives of a man who has been known for the occasional verbal gaffe and a lack of peripheral vision, but not for a lack of integrity.	2004-02-11

But in reading its pages, it's clear that it was really a labor of love, a massive project undertaken by an already established writer who had no need to produce something so unusual and challenging in order to help his own reputation.<br />But we are clearly better off because of he did produce it. Inside are exactly 200 precious stories, parables, fables, and good old fashioned yarns -- all of them plucked from the Italian folk tradition, dusted off, and improved by Mr. Calvino. I admit that &quot;improved&quot; is not a word I'd usually want to read in regard to a modern production of classic literature, but from the bits and pieces I know from experience, improvement was needed: many of the tales were originally published based on cobbled together version of traditional oral stories with partially-developed sub-plots and characters whose names or motives change partway through the story. I have seen the original Italian versions of at least three of the stories between this book's covers -- Fra Ignazio, Rosemary, and the Peacock Feather -- and was thoroughly confounded by the original, only to be charmed later by Mr. Calvino's cleaner and more thoughtful retellings.<br />It is important to remember that the Italian literary tradition dates further back in a direct line than any other in Western Europe: many of these tales were originally written in Italian long before the language evolved beyond being anything more than a vulgar street slang and when only Latin and Greek was spoken in the drawing rooms of literate Italians. And yet it wasn't until 1956 and Mr. Calvino's self-described obligation that more than a couple dozen or so of these wonderful stories was gathered in a single volume.<br />Hats off also to George Martin, Mr. Calvino's translator, surprisingly enough, for only this book. Mr. Martin does a terrific job of preserving Mr. Calvino's cadence and subtle linguistic flare, and he does it while staying away from the temptation of translating too literally, a flaw that has a hold on many less talented translators.d Mr. Calvino's self-described obligation that more than a couple dozen or so of these wonderful stories was gathered in a single volume. <br />Hats off also to George Martin, Mr. Calvino's translator, surprisingly enough, for only this book.

At that time, I was more or less the same age as the son of the book's narrator, Phaedrus, and of course I could not help but interpret the story from the younger man's perspective: this was an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct.<br />Now, as an adult, I see things through Phaedrus' eyes -- which is to say author Robert Persig's eyes, since in terms of concepts (if not geography) it is considered autobiographical -- and I can recognize many of Phaedrus' musings and thoughts as those of a man who is at once confident of and also seeking his place in the world.<br />The book is best known as a tribute or sequel to Henry David Thoreau's Walden, which Phaedrus refers to at several points. Others have pointed out, for example, that the protagonist's long (and not too interesting) discussion of what he carries in his knapsack recall Mr. Thoreau's own endless lists of the materials used to build his lakeside shack or the seeds he planted for his sustenance.<br />But there is much more to this book than that. The provocative blend of Eastern and Western thought, the way he generalizes regarding his philosophical predecessors (and gets some things wrong), the conclusions he draws and the way he sometimes fails to follow his own advice -- they blend to create a picture of an intelligent, complex, and flawed character. Not unlike many of the book's readers.<br />Maybe that is a key to the book's lasting impact -- at least to this point. Like Walden, the book has practically become an icon in the decades since it was published. A quick scan on Amazon reveals dozens of books using the title Zen and the Art of something ... of knitting ... of making a living ... of archery ... of falling in love ... of poker ... of day trading ... even of the actual maintenance of motorcycles.<br />But unlike Walden, I think the high water mark for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has come and gone. It was an interesting and compelling re-read for me -- as it would no doubt be for others -- but as I worked through it I started to realize that much of its appeal was as a philosophical time capsule, a glimpse at a time when the globalization of ideas was still new, when East and West were further apart than they are today. Take that away and most of what is left is an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct. And that's not so hard to find elsewhere.Art of something ... of knitting ... of making a living ... of archery ... of falling in love ... of poker ... of day trading ... even of the actual maintenance of motorcycles.<br />But unlike Walden, I think the high water mark for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has come and gone.

I am attracted to elegant writing in general, and to author Michael Ondaatje's work in particular. And the setting -- amid the problems revolving around the Sri Lankan Tamal Tigers -- is something I know about only from newspaper headlines and have been eager to know about on a more personal level.<br />Unfortunately, although I found this book wonderfully written, it seemed to be about almost nothing, at least nothing I could recognize. Open its pages and read almost any paragraph and the images and word choice will enchant you. But without a more coherent story line and better character development, I'm not sure who could enjoy this.<br />I did make my way  through the whole thing, but I found it slow, murky, depressing, ambiguous, and ultimately unsatisfying. The protagonist, forensic anthropologist Anil Tissera, is particularly puzzling in my mind: I read more than 300 pages dominated by her thoughts and fears and interactions and yet I still have no idea who she is.<br />Yes, the writing here is delecate and elegant. But one could say the same thing about most of Mr. Ondaatje's work. My suggestion is to pick another of his books, one that comes with a compelling story as well as the wonderful writing.	2004-01-26

So I easily assumed that this fun \\"what if\\" genre of looking at history would be fascinating to me.<br />And I was right, at least at first.<br />But over time, reading this book wore me down. That isn't a criticism of any essay in particular: I think that several -- such as Lewis Lapham's exploration into the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, Thomas Fleming's piece about how the American Revolution Could have been lost, and John Keegan's view on how Hitler's war could have been won -- are particularly strong. But like certain kinds of desert, what started out as a tasty indulgence just became too much to enjoy.<br />We've all had the experience of sitting next to a know-it-all guest at some dinner party, someone who has an unusual explanation for everything and who won't listen to anything or anyone who doesn't support what he thinks. That mind-numbing feeling is the similar to the one I had after reading a few of these essays in a row.<br />Does that mean you shouldn't buy this book? No, not necessarily. But if you do buy it, my suggestion would be to take it in stages. Read an essay or two and then switch to something else, and then come back to it. As for me, the purchase What If 2?, which once seemed assured, will have to wait a while.	2004-01-24

I don't want to go overboard (p. 78), but I must disagree with my previous reviewers here and say that this book is a worthwhile addition to any writers' shelf. I could jump on the bandwagon (p. 100) and criticize it for a lack of an index or the absence of overly detailed etymological information, but take it from me (p. 175), it does what it sets out to do fair and square (p. 57).<br />Notwithstanding what a previous reviewer wrote, the book certainly does shed light on (p. 167) the basic etymological origins of the most common (and many not-so-common) clich&eacute;s. Call me old-fashioned (p. 25) but I think the most important aspect of this book is that it keeps first things first (p. 63) by defining clich&eacute;s in a straight forward (p. 173) and dispassionate way -- something that prevents the text from eroding into the kind of mess that develops when an author tries to both inform and entertain.<br />At first glance (p. 7), I thought that an index was conspicuous in its absence (p. 33). But all things considered (p. 5), I wondered how effective an index in a case like this would be since it would necessarily have to be organized by key words in a phrase (even if there are several versions of it), the meaning of the phrase, and the meaning of any mistaken interpretations. In the final analysis (p. 94), I think that that the book is fine the way it is ... certainly nothing to be sneezed at (p. 135).<br />Last but not least (p. 100), while it's not for me to say (p. 96) whether owning this book will help you be a better writer or understand the written word better, I will say that if you glance through its pages and fail to learn something to your advantage (p. 112) I will eat my hat (p.50). I will summarize in order to be perfectly clear (p. 17): I am not saying this is the greatest thing since sliced bread (p. 79), but it is certainly quite good.	2004-01-23

Aureliano Buend&iacute;a among the great protagonists of 20th century literature.<br />A linguistics professor, the often hapless and despairing and always comical Mr. Pnin has an unexplainable pride and an obsessive-compulsive personality. Like the book's author Vladimir Nabokov, Mr. Pnin is a quirky Russian expatriate in middle class America: he would be hard pressed to be more foreign. And yet he is a wonderful illustration of everyone's fruitless attempts to control what cannot be controlled in their lives. He is a stinging parady of himself, of Mr. Nabokov, of us.<br />In my mind, Pnin surpasses even Mr. Nabakov's masterpiece Lolita, simply because so much of the story of unforgettable Lo-li-ta has become so clich&eacute; that much of the author's artistry is obscured from modern readers' eyes. But with Pnin, Mr. Nabokov's deft and subtle hand is plain to see.	2004-01-20

The trial is a ridiculous farce, and the real art comes from the way Meursault dispassionately describes the events overtaking him: the funeral, the trial, the sentencing. The story is at once beautiful and unsettling.<br />Of course, none of this is anything that hasn't already been said among the other reviews here. What prompted me to write a review about this now (after all, I had first read this story more than 20 years ago and have only re-read parts of it recently) is the new and much-heralded translation from Matthew Ward. Mr. Ward's work has been almost universally praised by critics, who have called it an essential update and a production that will make the book more accessible to American audiences.<br />That may be so, but I can't escape the feeling that it also cheapens this great book. I realize that some traditionalists will always accuse a modern translator of a classic piece of literature of tampering with art. But even if I keep that in mind as I read The Stranger in its newest form, I still get that sinking feeling.<br />Take the opening paragraph, for example. I have always considered the opening lines in The Stranger among the best in the western literary cannon, and they seem to lose firepower in Mr. Ward's version of the story: \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe. I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: `Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday.\\"<br />Compare that to the classic Stuart Gilbert translation that is familiar to most English speakers to have read this book: \\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: `Your mother passed away. Funeral tomorrow. Deep sympathy.' Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.\\"<br />Don't the short and choppy sentences of the telegram contrast strongly to the emotionless as-a-matter-of-fact narrative from Meursault in the second example? And isn't that lost in the newer version when both Meursault and the telegram have the same tone? The Meursault from Mr. Ward's translation always talks that way, giving the impression that he actually puts a bit of thought into what should be his dispassionate commentary, rather than just speaking in meandering run-on sentences as someone simply going through the motions would (and the way author Albert Camus described Meursault in later years).<br />Also, who is Maman? I'm not sure I would recognize the word as a form of \\"mother\\" if I weren't already familiar with the story.<br />In sum, the value of The Stranger is beyond doubt. But consider the issue of the translations strongly, and, if possible, consider one of the older translations that create a story closer to what I believe Mr. Camus intended and not something that may have been crafted to subtly reshape the story for modern audiences.s to have read this book: \\"Mother died today.

Here he talks about what he calls the \\"thrill\\" of boldly finding out what no man knew before, on subjects ranging from the discovery of the reasons behind the crash of the space shuttle Challenger to the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos and from the role of science in society to his Nobel acceptance speech. And while it is not specifically written with the non-scientist in mind, a strong background in science is not necessary to understand and enjoy the wind-ranging collection of philosophies, musings, and remarks collected on these pages.	2004-01-18

But upon a recent re-reading Timequake, I have realized that, objectively speaking, this is the product of a great writer in possession of declining powers, a volume that is predictable while puzzlingly swinging between memoir and fiction.<br />On the surface, the storyline is classic Vonnegut: there's a \\"time quake\\" that means that everyone in the world is forced to relive every second of every day between 1991 and 2001, but they are unable to change a moment of that unfortunate decade. Of course, he introduces himself and his alter ego Kilgore Trout into the story, and unusual situations abound.<br />There is nothing necessarily wrong with that, but it doesn't come off nearly as cleanly as similarly unusual storylines in Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse Five, and The Sirens of Titan do. In the end, when Timequake doesn't feel forced -- not a word I would use for any of Mr. Vonnegut's other novels -- it feels like the author is simply going through the motions.<br />There are bits and pieces of the story that revive the nostalgia that readers of Mr. Vonnegut's better books may be looking for. But for the uninitiated, there are better places to start.	2004-01-17

And that's a shame.<br />This is a wonderfully written story that convincingly challenges the traditional sympathies we all developed in reading Hamlet, especially regarding Hamlet's cold and calculating mother. Mr. Updike forcefully and dramatically paints a picture of Gertrude as a sweet and decent woman fatally flawed by her attraction to Claudius, her husband's brother. And Claudius plays more than a supporting role here, giving more insight into Hamlet, who at once seems more confused and easier to understand. It all works because of Mr. Updike's wit, insight, and often perfect timing.<br />Gertrude and Claudius is also a scholarly study, based on the same source materials Shakespeare used. In fact, as the plot draws closer to Hamlet's 30th birthday and the start of the play that carries his name, Mr. Updike changes to progressively newer sources. That creates a story is \\"historically\\" accurate (well, as much as a story based on ancient legends can be). Incidentally, there is an interesting and slightly confusing aspect to that as well: Claudius starts out as Feng, and then becomes Fengon before finally being called Claudius; for his part, Hamlet starts out as Amleth. Each section starts with the words \\"The king was irate,\\" but in each case there is a different king -- Horwendil (Amleth's father), then Fengon, then Hamlet.<br />But one of the most compelling aspects to the story is the fact that it was written at all. Mr. Updike is a writer near the end of his career and with nothing left to prove. He has excelled writing several genres of fiction, criticism, poetry, and commentary. And yet this story shows that he is still experimenting, still challenging his abilities.	2004-01-17

And while I'm not sure I agree with author Jack Hollander's claim that fighting poverty may be the single most important environmental step available to us, it is certainly among the most important steps.<br />But the idea that poverty is responsible for all of our environmental ills is a simple-minded and counter-productive argument. If that were so, how does one explain that 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gasses (which most scientists link to global warming) are produced by only 25 wealthy and industrialized countries? How many developing countries have had nuclear reactor accidents? Why are cancer rates higher in wealthy nations? What percentage of the world's bunker fuels (toxic transport-related pollution, mostly from jet airplanes) is released by groups based in Africa, Latin America, or unindustrialized Asia?<br />Even taking all of that into account, the scale is tilted even more toward the environmental culpability of wealthy nations than is apparent. Witness the biggest environmental disasters of the last generation: Shell in Nigeria, Dow Chemical in India, and Texaco in Ecuador, to name three. They all took place in the developing world, true, but only with the money, technology, and personnel paid for by companies from wealthy countries.<br />The most damning evidence against Mr. Hollander's thesis may be related to climate change. It is accurate to say that the developing world burns unfiltered fossil fuels, which, gram for gram, release more CO2 into the atmosphere than natural gas, refined petroleum, or even coal. But how many small fires designed to keep a family warm during a cold desert night are needed to balance out the smelters and factories of Pittsburgh, Manchester, or Turin? Yes, the third world is still using polluting leaded gasoline that most wealthy countries outlawed a decade ago, but does anyone think that all the old cars on the streets of Havana or Nairobi can produce the same pollution in a week that a single hour of traffic on the highways of Los Angeles or Hong Kong releases into the atmosphere?<br />Of course, poverty issues must be addressed, but addressing them will not produce an environmental panacea. In fact, it would likely do the opposite: the quickest route to wealth for most poor countries is a rapid industrialization, simply because that takes advantage of cheap labor and it sidesteps the need for a widely educated workforce. But that route usually involves the purchase of outdated equipment, the use of cheep (and usually polluting) fuel sources. And third-world governments bent on industrialization rarely have a desire to pass and enforce environmental rules.<br />There are important areas where eliminating poverty would help the environment: wealthier farmers are more likely to rotate crops to assure the long-term viability of the land (and give less reason for deforestation) and less likely to pollute the water supply with harmful fertilizers. Population growth rates are lower in rich countries because children cease being an economic asset (free labor) and start to become an economic cost (another person to feed and clothe). And of course there is the incontrovertible injustice of those of us in wealthy countries doing nothing while millions around the world are at risk of starvation.<br />But framing this in an environmental context is just wrong. Not only is it inaccurate, but it can also be spun into a dangerous diverting tactic, an excuse for rich countries to do nothing about their own environmental sins and instead point a gnarled finger at the Third World and claim those countries must act first.at the Third World and claim those countries must act first.	2004-01-13
US	52000975	R2DAJEZRPVUO9W	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	1	49	62	N	N	Leonardo in drag	Some of my fellow reviewers wrote that this was a book they couldn't put down. But once I started it and I did put it down, I found the book hard to pick up again -- my mind just filled with so many other things I'd rather be doing. About half way through I gave up the fight and didn't even try to start reading again.<br />It isn't that the book is dense or difficult to read. To the contrary: I'd say that at first glance, author Dan Brown is a compelling storyteller, adept at seamlessly leading the reader from one scene to another. Sure, his constant foreshadowing is more often than not heavy handed, and some of the peripheral characters seem a little two-dimensional. But those are (unfortunately) common flaws and not the reason I was so displeased by the book.<br />What really bothered me was how much Mr. Brown got wrong. The first example is the book's title: &quot;da Vinci&quot; isn't Leonardo's family name, it is a reference to his illegitimate father, which is a reference to the father's home town of Vinci, just west of Florence. In Italian, &quot;da Vinci&quot; just means &quot;from Vinci.&quot; No, Leonardo, like his contemporaries Raffaello and Giulio Romano, like Giotto, like Caravaggio, like Rembrandt ... like modern day Cher or Madonna, is correctly referred to by his given name. The book should have been called &quot;The Leonardo Code&quot; or &quot;The Leonardo da Vinci Code.&quot;<br />Inside, there is more of the same. The author refers to some invented speculation that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is really a portrait of Leonardo himself in drag. Proof? Mr. Brown narrative says that computers show that key facial features are the same as those in contemporary portraits of Leonardo and that without this explanation the identity of the model is a mystery. The truth? No contemporary portraits of Leonardo exist, while the identity of the model in the famous painting is extremely well documented.<br />There is more: Leonardo's &quot;Last Supper&quot; is not a fresco, as the book says. And the idea that Mary Magdalene somehow dressed up as a man and appears in the painting in lieu of one of the apostles is more than a little far fetched.<br />I know that a novel cannot be taken as a historical document and that by definition, events are fictionalized in any work of fiction. But they have to be fictionalized in a context that is real or at least believable. If that doesn't happen, the structure of the story crumbles because we no longer know what means something and what doesn't. A more specific example: the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; carries with it certain information, who the subject was, what the painting means, who painted it, and its place in the West's cultural canon. Those factors are part of the package that simply cannot be jettisoned. If the author wanted a painting (or an artist) that didn't carry those exact meanings, then he would be better off selecting different subjects, or just making them up from scratch.<br />If a novel set in modern times included a character who drove a '78 Ford Pinto, we could draw certain conclusions about him. Maybe he doesn't have much money, or he has a bad taste in cars, or he has been forced to use this unfortunate vehicle. But if the story is written so that the Pinto is candy apple red, that it attracts &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahhs&quot; from people who see it, and can race down the highway at 200 mph, then we scratch our heads. Why did the author call the car a Pinto? Wouldn't it be easier and better to have called it a Ferrari?<br />When I first started to notice these kinds of incongruities in The Da Vinci Code, I wondered if they were early clues that Robert Langdon, the main protagonist, was a bit delusional, or at least too free and easy with the facts. But it didn't take long to understand that the one who was too free and easy with the facts was the author.a fresco, as the book says.

But even if the worst is yet to come, this collection of slapstick humor and wisecracks is tilted enough to assure that its subtitle -- A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right -- should only be said between snickers or with tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br />I don't differ with most aspects of author Al Franken's political agenda. He makes important points regarding the GOP's reliance on &quot;Clinton bashing&quot; as a fallback explanation for almost anything that goes awry. And I have always enjoyed seeing political figures with the spotlight placed on their job-related lies and misrepresentations, something that Mr. Franken's eager team of Harvard researchers seems adept at uncovering. In my opinion, the basic ideas behind his views on the Bush tax cuts, the war in Iraq, and election strategies come close to the mark.<br />But I wonder why it is so hard to produce some kind of thoughtful and intelligent partisan discussion these days, something biting and serious but written well enough to capture the public's imagination. By that standard, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them falls flat on its face. The book instead settles for being Mr. Franken's latest self-centered treatise with another title that sounds as if it was written by an R-rated Dr. Seuss and filled with arguments pat enough that they could fit into word balloons over the heads of teenage comic book characters. We deserve better.	2004-01-04

Vino Italiano is not the best book if what you need is an introduction to Italian wine. But if you already know there is a big difference between a Vino Rosso di Montepulciano and a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, then you'll no doubt appreciate this informative and easy-to-read book as much as I do.<br />This book gives the lover of Italian wine, food, and culture a lot to be excited about. It is divided into chapters that cover an Italian region (or in one case, two minor regions) and each chapter contains more information than some lesser books contain in their entirety. Included are regional recipes, maps and other essential information (e.g. significant producers, grapes grown, etc.) related to its wines, and stunning black-and-white photos that make it tempting to regard this as a coffee-table book. But I think the best part of each chapter is a well-written and entertaining essay that includes anecdotes that frame the character of the people, history, and culture of the region being described.<br />Of course, the centerpiece of it all is wine. But authors David Lynch and Joseph Bastianich understand that even in Italy, that subject cannot stand alone, and so they bring in discussions of hunting, and football, and fashion, and Mussolini, and cars, and artisan vinegars, oils, and cheeses.<br />Reading over what I have written here, I feel that I have not done this book justice. There is such a range of well-researched information here presented in such an accessible way that a different reader might pick it up and enjoy the book just as much as I do but for an entirely different set of reasons.<br />Perhaps the best way to conclude, then, is with my own brief anecdote: Italy is a country very understandably proud of its culture of food and wine, and the domestic Italian best-seller lists always have a few new books on those subjects listed on them. And yet every time - without fail - that I show this book to my Italian friends, their comment is, \\"Why can't we have a book like this in Italian?\\"book like this in Italian?\\"	2004-01-01

Travel, I have always thought, is about experiencing a different culture and its history and not about checking the most important cathedral or museum in a city off a to-do list.<br />But I must admit this small-but-thick book intrigued me. Most of the criticisms of something like this will be of specific choices the author makes: How could she overlook X? Or what was she thinking when she included Y? And while I admit that I scratched my head at a few curious omissions and chuckled at some of the choices that did make the cut, I must say that overall, the selection is very good. Every traveler or would-be traveler will find selections of interest on its pages, whether they are looking for luxury or natural beauty or history or art or culinary masterpieces or thought-provoking journeys.<br />But I think the real strength of 1,000 Places to See Before You Die is author Patricia Schultz' lively writing. Ms. Schultz has a real gift for description, and her love and enthusiasm for the places she writes about at once manage to excite the reader about the place being described and to give him or her a small taste of it before even diverting the eyes from the page.<br />All that said, I would be disappointed to scan someone else's copy of this book and see places that have been already visited crossed off in red ink or to discover that future trips were being planned to maximize the number of the 1,000 places that can be visited in a short time. I don't think the book should be used like that, but rather as a means to provoke thought and conversation regarding the best of what the world has to offer us by giving us the views held by one person (albeit someone who is extremely well traveled and with unusual writing talent). We'll all come up with our own lists in our heads, lists that may or may not overlap with the contents of this book. And that's something worth being passionate about.he contents of this book.

Books	2	27	43	N	N	I'm still wondering	Oh, I know how the dictionary defines Gnosticism, and I have a general idea about the philosophy (for lack of a better word) from having briefly studied the famous Gnostic gospels at one point. But I have always been interested in learning more about these early might-be Christians, and so I bought this book with the hope of reaching a deeper understanding of the subject. Sadly, after difficult-to-read 350 pages I'm still left wondering.<br />One of the problem with the Gnostics is that until 1945, knowledge of their beliefs and influences has been second or third hand, based on what early church historians and orthodox polemicists had to say about them. But 1945 was when a library of what are thought to be Gnostic writings -- the gospels -- was discovered in Nag Hammadi in Egypt. This book examines those writings.<br />So far so good, but the point author Karen King seems trying to make here -- apparent contradictions in the writings discovered in 1945, speculation about the origins of Gnosticism (she thinks its roots are in Judaism, but she failed to persuade me) -- seem muddled. Ms. King apparently seeks to explain the Gnostics as a group that can be understood, with a common evolution and a set range of beliefs. But I came away thinking just the opposite: that what as been traditionally attributed to Gnosticism may actually be a catch-all phrase for religious thinkers contemporary to early Christianity that don't fit into any other category, like the choice of \\"other\\" that appears at the end of a census form or opinion questionnaire.<br />The book is too poorly organized, dense, and tough to navigate to be compensated for by the interesting and thought-proviking points Ms. King raises from time to time.  There must be something better on this subject.	2003-12-18

This book is more than 800 pages long, and so I assume that the post-1975 stories were held out both in order to make sure the book could be lifted without strain or (more likely) as the stuff for a second mammoth volume of this great writer's work.<br />Most of us already know at least a few of the 102 stories in this thick book (I read one, \\"A &amp; P,\\" when I was in high school, long before I became a fan of Mr. Updike's work, and I didn't even realize he had been the author of it until I saw it again here), and many of the ones we don't know will reveal themselves as gems. But also -- fortunately or unfortunately -- many of the stories here simply don't work: the plots are either dated, or the characters or their motivations are too thin.<br />Curiously, I am unsure about whether this is positive or negative. I dismiss the possibility that the uneven quality here is natural when examining the work of a young writer not yet fully in control of his powers. After all, Mr. Updike had already created his two most memorable characters -- Rabbit Angstrom and Henry Bech (who appears in this book) -- before most of these stories came to life.<br />Instead, I see this as welcome proof that Mr. Updike is human, that he doesn't produce something awe inspiring every time his pen touches paper. That's the same realization I had when I saw my boyhood sports hero, quarterback Bob Greise, in a live game for the first time and all he seemed to do was get sacked and throw interceptions and incomplete passes all afternoon. In both cases, it's not the way I would have written the script, but perhaps it makes the truly great performances (and they are here, too) seem even better.afternoon.

I'm going to ask to be trusted on that, because -- try as I might -- I can't find a way to describe it and make it sound as good as it is. Of course, that may be part of the attraction of this soulful, entertaining, and rewarding novel, the fact that its value cannot be easily identified and named.<br />Certainly it wasn't the subject matter that captured me. Born in the mid-1960s, I'm of the generation old enough to remember the Summer of Love, tie-die tee-shirts, and flower-painted VW vans, but not old enough to have been part of the era they are identified with. And even since then, when some aspect of those days rides into vogue on a wave of nostalgia, the period has seemed interesting to me only in the most general terms.<br />But T. Coraghessan Boyle's important new novel is about the details: a 1970s California commune burning out a step or two faster than the hippie movement as a whole. The story has the obligatory bad LSD trip, and the predictable complaints about free love. But instead of becoming a clich&eacute;, it manages to reveal the ugly (and smelly) realities of commune life while drawing the reader in with something other than the kind of curiosity that makes people stare at car accidents. The prose is fast-paced, easy to read, and at times very funny, while also exposing a surprising level of human complexity and societal insight.<br />I suppose it shouldn't be a surprise. As anyone who has read World's End knows, Mr. Boyle is one of contemporary literature's best pure storytellers, and he's returned to his former heights here. Trust me on that.	2003-12-07

After all, how can someone with such a tilted and iconoclastic view of the world be sane? The Far Side is long gone from newspaper funny pages, but I'll admit that the thought crossed my mind again as I flipped through the pages of this massive collection.<br />Yes, &quot;massive&quot; is the right word. A few days ago in a bookstore in Milan, I saw what was reported to be the first copy of the book in Italy. It took both hands to transfer the collection to the viewing table, and I almost had to remind myself to lift with my knees and not my back. The literature that came with it said it tipped the scales at around 9 kilos or nearly 20 pounds. That's almost as much as the spare tire for a car, or more than a case of wine. Obviously, Mr. Larson would be more likely to compare the weight to a family of talking chickens or that troublemaker Rex, the dog-philosopher -- but the uninitiated wouldn't figure that out until the books are actually open.<br />When open, of course, the warped humor of the Far Side takes over. I loved the strip from the first time I saw it: this time around I felt very nostalgic about re-experiencing the brief instant between when I finish looking at the panel and when I &quot;get&quot; it, and the personal recognition at feel when I see the puzzled look or knowing smirk that the child-like drawings manage to convey.<br />Looking at this new book, another quality to Mr. Larson's work came into focus: I think it speaks directly to the creative and self-deprecating side of American culture we have seen too little of lately. It's not universal ... few non-Americans understand it. In a busy bookstore in the center of Milan, with customers poking around the latest releases on subjects as mundane as writing HTML code and gossip about the Formula 1 race car circuit, I got lost in the pages of this collection for more than 45 minutes without anyone looking over my shoulder or asking me when I'd be finished. It had been on display for 10 days or two weeks, and yet the pages looked almost untouched.<br />There's more here than just Far Side cartoons -- its pages incorporate angry reader responses to cartoons, and some of the clever responses. They include essays (including one from Steve Martin!), explanations, and anecdotes, all of it with top quality binding.<br />All in all, it's not surprising that it's such a hefty production.

The story is so tightly and entertainingly written that I practically inhaled it (pun intended), taking less than a day to finish the book's nearly 300 pages even though for the most part I had to read it a few pages at a time while working at a conference.<br />Author Christopher Buckley pulled off the seemingly impossible here: making a despicable protagonist like Nick Naylor seem sympathetic. I won't go into the way Mr. Buckley does it, but it is definitely worth finding out for yourself.<br />My only complaint is that the ending to the story wraps up a little too neatly, a little too much like Hollywood. It's a weakness, but not a serious enough of a weakness to cloud the value of this original and clever book.	2003-11-19

You may even find yourself looking at the world through Zazie's wide eyes, seeing things with the innocence of a child narrated with a vocabulary like Charles Bukowski's.<br />I pity poor translator Barbara Wright -- author Raymond Queneau's preferred translator, from what I understand -- for what must have been buckets of perspiration shed in what could have only worked as a labor of love. After all, this is a book is more about language and dialogue than it is about anything that could be mistaken for a plot.<br />The other main source of Zazie in the Metro's charm comes from its unusual roll call of characters. Aside from the always-interesting Zazie, the book offers the quixotic and curious \\"Unkoo\\" Gabriel, his dour sometimes foil Gridoux, and even a parrot called Laverdure, whose solitary line -- \\"Talk, talk, that's all you can do\\" -- seems to get blurted out only with exceptional timing.<br />It's easy to understand how this colorful tale inspired a generation of French readers and writers. It is even said to have had a hold on Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director of the wonderful and similarly playful film, Amelie.<br />Compared to all this, the plot of this story hardly seems worth mentioning: young Zazie comes to Paris to visit her uncle, but what she really wants to do is ride on the metro for the first time. Because of a strike, she can't, and she compensates with a string of other adventures.<br />Up until this point, I know, this does not sound like a three-star review (or three and a half, if that had been possible). I have given Zazie in the Metro what amounts to a so-so rating for reasons I am not too sure how to describe.

US	52000975	RXYQRSRHGX8F5	0060087757	850040655	Spanglish: The Making of a New American Language (Spanish Edition)	Books	3	18	27	N	N	Purists beware	The author compares Spanglish -- the hybrid &quot;language&quot; part way between Spanish and English -- with Yiddish, a mixture of Hebrew and German that evolved into the mother language for Jews in Eastern Europe. But I see it closer to Ebonics, an effort to put an acceptable face on something that should not be acceptable, an excuse for speaking badly.<br />Now, that is not a criticism of the book as much as it is of the concept (or the phenomenon) the book is based on. But to the extent that author Ilan Stavans promotes this lowering of the language bar, I cannot help but take issue with this slim volume.<br />Spanglish (the book, not the &quot;language&quot;) is much more a reference resource than it is something one would read from cover to cover, with most of the pages taken up by a 4500-word Spanglish dictionary (just writing that phrase made my heart sink). But the introductory essay -- called the &quot;Jerga Loca,&quot; or Crazy Slang -- gives Mr. Stavans' take on the issue of Spanglish, which he seems to see as a fully mature idiom. This is something that may or may not be true, but which gives me heartburn just to think about.<br />Take, for example, the wonderful opening line of Don Quixote: &quot;En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme....&quot; (In English: &quot;In a certain corner of la Mancha, the name of which I do not choose to remember ....&quot;). Mr. Stavans cheapens it to: &quot;In un placete de la Mancha, of which the nombre no quiero remembrearme....&quot; It makes my skin crawl.<br />I cannot deny Mr. Stavans' point that language is dynamic and evolving. Simply comparing the writings of William Shakespeare with those of Charles Dickens with those of John Updike is enough to prove that. Glance even at Miguel Cervantes, who spelled the same of his protagonist &quot;Don Quijote&quot; in the original. But this is a process that happens naturally and without encouragement, and it is certainly not served by lowering expectations to the lowest common denominator.<br />I do not give the book a lower rating simply because it must be judged -- at least for the most part -- for what it is, and on those terms I find it well researched and effectively written. It might even serve as an effective primer for &quot;gringos&quot; unfamiliar with Latin American culture and who want to learn to understand certain unfortunate Hispanic Americans. But I select three stars while holding my nose, because while the spread of Spanglish cannot be denied, I think that anything that promotes it just stinks.tions to the lowest common denominator.<br />I do not give the book a lower rating simply because it must be judged -- at least for the most part -- for what it is, and on those terms I find it well researched and effectively written.

It is also a fascinating tour of the mind of Marcus Aurelius, the military leader, emperor, educator, philanthropist, and philosopher who remains one of history's most noble protagonists, and whose writings reveal the loneliness of his soul without being bitter.<br />This is a must-have book for the nightstand of anyone living a contemplative life, a profound precursor to modern self-help books written by a Renaissance man who lived centuries before the Renaissance.<br />There is no plot to summarize here, no accurate generalizations to be made. One gets the idea that these are thoughts the author jotted down, sometimes between appointments and sometimes after months of contemplation. Often they are obvious, sometimes they are obscure. They can seem rooted in history, and at times based on today's current events. They can be funny, surprising, or sad. But they are almost always worthwhile.<br />A final note: I have two editions of this book, and while I think both this one and the Hicks' translation are very good, I prefer this by a small degree.	2003-10-23

I just sat down for a quiet night of reading some wonderful Pablo Neruda poems while sipping from a soothing cup of warm tea, and I was rudely shocked at the ham-handed translations I found on the pages of this book!<br />I am not particularly a fan of poetry, but Mr. Neruda's transcendent and passionate work has always held a special place in my heart. I discovered Mr. Neruda's poems in the original Spanish some time ago, but I bought this edition more recently because I feared that the last few years in Italy had eroded by Spanish skills to the point that I'd benefit from having my native English to refer to for help. Instead, the translations left me appalled.<br />Anyone reading Mr. Neruda's poems for the first time with this book could only assume that this great poet was a mediocre talent trying to impress beyond his abilities. The rhythm is gone, the intelligence is altered, and the word choice sometimes sounds as if it was produced by one of those annoying Internet translation programs. At points, I was seriously left wondering if Mr. Belitt is even a native English speaker.<br />It's a terrible shame, too, because it's so nice to have both languages in the same edition. And while I am strongly critical of Mr. Belitt's translations, I cannot at all fault his selection of poems: all of the Neruda poems I like best are here, whether they are well known or obscure.<br />As I am about to file this review, I see that all but a couple of my fellow reviewers came to the same conclusion I did. Take our advice, please! Seek out another, better translation of Mr. Neruda's work. I'm not sure which to suggest, but rest assured that you could hardly find an inferior one.	2003-10-22

That's the rule I made up that allots a book that many pages to convince me to continue. If it fails to do so, it's back to the shelf or into a box -- sometimes to never be heard from again.<br />The Sheltering Sky is a good book, but it starts slow and never manages to evolve into any kind of a page-turner. But something I can't put my finger on wouldn't let me push it aside after those 50 pages, something I'm now very glad for.<br />The general premise of the story is simple: three Americans travel to Morocco in the wake of the Second World War to escape civilization and to find themselves. But the story is really an exploration into the way people react in a crisis and especially the way Americans interact with unfamiliar cultures.<br />It makes for a memorable if not effortless read, one of the popular 20th century books that deserve the label &quot;classic&quot; and that will compel you to confront your own morality, ethics, arrogance and pathos.<br />Though the book is dense and serious, it is not without a few subtle jokes: the two rival French army commanders, one of whom drinks only cognac and the other named d'Armagnac; the pathetic and entertaining Lyles; the unintentionally comic diplomat who tries to help Kit over the book's final pages.<br />I'll conclude with a tip: once you've finished The Sheltering Sky, go back and re-read the first chapter. It's beautifully written, but some of its insights are clear only in retrospect.	2003-09-26

I don't attach to it the same deep meanings that some of my fellow reviewers did, but there is plenty here that any true book lover will identify with and enjoy.<br />I found the book a bit uneven -- we've all read enough bad poetry to want to avoid reading about flawed verse in the chapter called Scorn Not the Sonnet, and while the point is well made in Nothing New Under the Sun, I felt I was going to suffocate under the weight of all those footnotes. But where Ex Libris is good it is very good.<br />On this book's pages, you'll find charming anecdotes about messages written inside book covers, funny stories about people compelled to proofread at all time, an essay on the joy of reading a book in the place it is about, and a little stab at the annoying practice of removing the gender from popular sayings. Every one a gem.<br />This is also a handsome edition of the book, making it a great gift for any book lovers you know. It's an even better gift to yourself.	2003-09-26

Unlike most other books in the genre, The Great Unraveling is smart and informed, it avoids selectively choosing facts that artificially make the author's points seem clearer than they are, and it does not rely on comedy as a substitute for insight and intelligence.<br />Bravo to author, columnist and economist Paul Krugman for creating the first political book I've seen this season that is at once honest enough, well researched enough, and also well written enough that it can target an audience that stretches far beyond the usual policy wonks and think tankers. Mr. Krugman somehow manages to be angry and sensible at the same time, no easy trick.<br />Yes, of course, the author has an agenda. But anyone who thinks it is a simple &quot;get-Bush&quot; agenda is looking at it too simply. In this book Mr. Krugman looks at policy with an extremely critical but fair eye -- exactly what the fourth estate is supposed to be doing. Thank goodness someone is still doing his job.<br />I have been a reader of Mr. Krugman's columns in the International Herald-Tribune for some time, and so I had read many of the &quot;chapters&quot; before they appeared in The Great Unraveling. But there is a great value to having all of these pieces in one place. And those who do not read Mr. Krugman's thoughts on a regular basis will find it hard to believe these writings were not written with the intention of forming a logical and cogent argument as they do on the book's 300-plus pages.<br />I have always thought that Mr. Krugman's strength is his ability as a writer to make complex arguments understandable without cheapening them, but what I like best about his work is that he uses his writing skill in a supporting role, letting the facts tell the true tale.<br />My complaint? I would have liked to see more new and longer commentary here. There is some, but one of the shortcomings to Mr. Krugman's normal forum in the New York Times is that he is limited to 500 or 750 words to make important points regarding issues as complex as the nation's budgetary problems, the justification for the war in Iraq, and corporate blunders.

But even if the worst is yet to come, this collection of slapstick humor and wisecracks is tilted enough to assure that its subtitle -- A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right -- should only be said between snickers or with tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br />I don't differ with most aspects of author Al Franken's political agenda. He makes important points regarding the GOP's reliance on \\"Clinton bashing\\" as a fallback explanation for almost anything that goes awry. And I have always enjoyed seeing political figures with the spotlight placed on their job-related lies and misrepresentations, something that Mr. Franken's eager team of Harvard researchers seems adept at uncovering. In my opinion, the basic ideas behind his views on the Bush tax cuts, the war in Iraq, and election strategies come close to the mark.<br />But I wonder why it is so hard to produce some kind of thoughtful and intelligent partisan discussion these days, something biting and serious but written well enough to capture the public's imagination. By that standard, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them falls flat on its face. The book instead settles for being Mr. Franken's latest self-centered treatise with another title that sounds as if it was written by an R-rated Dr. Seuss and filled with arguments pat enough that they could fit into word balloons over the heads of teenage comic book characters. We deserve better.	2003-09-02

But what many people don't know is that Chronicle of a Death Foretold is the book that won Mr. Garcia-Marquez the Nobel Prize.<br />Sure, that's mostly a quirk of the calendar. But the book was Mr. Garcia-Marquez's most recent publication when the Nobel committee sat down to discuss who deserved the award for literature in 1982. And though it's hard to imagine anyone on the committee nominating the venerable Colombian as a result of this slim volume, it is easy to conclude that nothing here would make them second guess their votes either.<br />Chronicle of a Death Foretold has everything that makes the work of Mr. Garcia-Marquez such a joy, albeit in abbreviated form. Its pages contain great characters and names, unusual events made believable by the storyteller's skill, a mysterious storyline, a surprising complexity.<br />And because of its diminutive size and straightforward style, it's a great way to sample the Mr. Garcia-Marquez's work for the first time.<br />If you do that and enjoy the story, try News of a Kidnapping in addition to the two great novels mentioned above. The two -- News of a Kidnapping and Chronicle of a Death Foretold -- are the two novels that employ a style that harkens back to Mr. Garcia-Marquez's early days as a journalist, using interviews and investigation as a base for a fictionalized reconstruction of real events recounted with the same style that earned the author his reputation.	2003-09-01

Author Paulo Coelho does a good job here of describing the mindset that would lead someone to suicide, and in setting the stage for Veronika's rebirth in the later parts of the book. Really understanding the book, I think, requires understanding this part.<br />But understanding Mr. Coelho requires understanding the rest of the story.<br />There is a simple beauty to Mr. Coelho's style, in evidence as he describes Veronika's ascent from the depths of her private purgatory to her return to her place among the living. This evolution in Veronika is the crux of the book and it illustrates Mr. Coelho's strengths and weaknesses as a storyteller: his ideas are fresh and original and his sense of plot of solid. But his techniques as a writer, his dialogues, his pacing, are weak.<br />To be sure, Mr. Coelho's ideas are the cornerstones of his legion fan base. The ideas are not only visible in this book when it comes to Veronika's rebirth but also in interesting but minor parts of the story. One of my favorites was when Mari -- an antagonist to Veronika, a lawyer, and a fellow patient at the Villete hospital where most of the story takes place -- muses about how she would defend Adam in the eyes of God for the role he played in the Fall of Man. I also enjoyed the metaphor from Zedka -- another patient -- about the king and queen who rules a kingdom of mad people and how they reacted.<br />But I quarrel with Mr. Coelho's development of characters, and especially with his choice of dialogue. Veronika, notwithstanding her epic journey from being suicidal to becoming essentially optimistic, can seem almost two-dimensional in the sense that she seems to evolve on her own, like a self-contained universe. And events are too pat: witness Eduard, who may have been pretending to be a schizophrenic waiting for the off chance that someone like Veronika would come along.<br />The dialogue is similarly contrived. Open the book to any page and read out loud what is between quotation marks and it will probably seem artificial. People do not talk that way -- especially when they are talking to themselves, which is often the case here. I also wonder why Mr. Coelho chose to put certain dialogue -- things like &quot;yes, I will&quot; or &quot;sometimes I do,&quot; which would normally be added to the narration in the form of paraphrase -- in quotations when they add almost nothing to the characters' development.<br />I have friends who are big fans of Mr. Coelho's work and they tell me that these unconventional characteristics add to the other-worldliness of the author's stories. I can see how that might work, but I cannot help but feel that they simply make the story less effective, that they dull the edge of what could be sharply original and important story rather than one that is merely good.<br />Despite that, I will say that if you are reading these reviews because you are undecided about whether or not to read Mr. Coelho's books, I would encourage you to do so and to start with Veronika Decides to Die. In spite of its imperfections, it is a quick and enjoyable read and probably the best point of entry to the collection of work from a writer who has enjoyed phenomenal success worldwide. As I have stated, I do not believe this is a book without flaw, but I cannot be so critical as to say the story is also without value.

That significance is something to savor.<br />I will avoid the clich&eacute; of saying that the story &quot;has it all,&quot; but Sacred Hunger does come close to that. There's the adventure of a band of men moving between three continents and pushed until they snapped and yet optimistically deciding to create what they saw as a kind of utopia, there is an examination of the cruelty that humans are capable of inflicting on each other, the story includes an accurate lesson in a period of history and its economics and geography, a touching love story, a metaphor for modern times.<br />Curiously, the pages also include the story of a small brass button. I still haven't decided what the button represents, but I did note that it is the only thing in the story that manages to survive all the kinds of hell the length of the story includes, changing hands at least six times between the beginning of the book and its final pages and yet it ends up no worse off.<br />The title of this volume refers to its grandest theme, the desire that drives men to extreme action. It is in this aspect that the book shines brightest, as the term is defined differently but compellingly for each of the main characters, especially the two main characters, cousins Erasmus Kemp and Matthew Paris.<br />There is a sacred hunger in almost all of the less central characters as well, in Michael Sullivan (the fiddle player who longed to be treated like a man ... and only person to own the brass button twice), in Billy Blair (who was robbed of his money and who ended up a judge), in Saul Thurso (the captain who never failed his owners), even in many of the slaves and the other seamen forced into service, and in the soldiers camped in Florida and Africa. Therein lies one of the potential stumbling blocks for readers of Sacred Hunger: it includes a great many characters and to really understand the book it is imperative to remember who came from where and which character has a problem with or a debt to whom. Most of the crew is introduced starting with chapter 12, and I found myself referring back to that part of the book often to remember the particulars of certain figures. Later, it is also important to remember the characteristics of different African tribes involved in the story.<br />There are few female characters in the book, and those who do appear can seem unconvincing compared to the complex representations of many of the men. Similarly, I found myself wishing I knew much more about the artist and philosopher Delblanc, who comes into the story late but who plays an absolutely key role. If I have a criticism of the book it is the way Delblanc is developed.<br />But I use the conditional on that point because I am not sure if I do indeed have a criticism of the book. It is easy to seek out minor discrepancies or personal critiques in a volume of this size and scope, but the fact remains that sacred Hunger is a breathtaking story, the best I've read in some time.lies one of the potential stumbling blocks for readers of Sacred Hunger: it includes a great many characters and to really understand the book it is imperative to remember who came from where and which character has a problem with or a debt to whom.

But once I started it and I did put it down, I found the book hard to pick up again -- my mind just filled with so many other things I'd rather be doing. About half way through I gave up the fight and didn't even try to start reading again.<br />It isn't that the book is dense or difficult to read. To the contrary: I'd say that at first glance, author Dan Brown is a compelling storyteller, adept at seamlessly leading the reader from one scene to another. Sure, his constant foreshadowing is more often than not heavy handed, and some of the peripheral characters seem a little two-dimensional. But those are (unfortunately) common flaws and not the reason I was so displeased by the book.<br />What really bothered me was how much Mr. Brown got wrong. The first example is the book's title: \\"da Vinci\\" isn't Leonardo's family name, it is a reference to his illegitimate father, which is a reference to the father's home town of Vinci, just west of Florence. In Italian, \\"da Vinci\\" just means \\"from Vinci.\\" No, Leonardo, like his contemporaries Raffaello and Giulio Romano, like Giotto, like Caravaggio, like Rembrandt ... like modern day Cher or Madonna, is correctly referred to by his given name. The book should have been called \\"The Leonardo Code\\" or \\"The Leonardo da Vinci Code.\\"<br />Inside, there is more of the same. The author refers to some invented speculation that the \\"Mona Lisa\\" is really a portrait of Leonardo himself in drag. Proof? Mr. Brown narrative says that computers show that key facial features are the same as those in contemporary portraits of Leonardo and that without this explanation the identity of the model is a mystery. The truth? No contemporary portraits of Leonardo exist, while the identity of the model in the famous painting is extremely well documented.<br />There is more: Leonardo's \\"Last Supper\\" is not a fresco, as the book says. And the idea that Mary Magdalene somehow dressed up as a man and appears in the painting in lieu of one of the apostles is more than a little far fetched.<br />I know that a novel cannot be taken as a historical document and that by definition, events are fictionalized in any work of fiction. But they have to be fictionalized in a context that is real or at least believable. If that doesn't happen, the structure of the story crumbles because we no longer know what means something and what doesn't. A more specific example: the \\"Mona Lisa\\" carries with it certain information, who the subject was, what the painting means, who painted it, and its place in the West's cultural canon. Those factors are part of the package that simply cannot be jettisoned. If the author wanted a painting (or an artist) that didn't carry those exact meanings, then he would be better off selecting different subjects, or just making them up from scratch.<br />If a novel set in modern times included a character who drove a '78 Ford Pinto, we could draw certain conclusions about him. Maybe he doesn't have much money, or he has a bad taste in cars, or he has been forced to use this unfortunate vehicle. But if the story is written so that the Pinto is candy apple red, that it attracts \\"oohs\\" and \\"ahhs\\" from people who see it, and can race down the highway at 200 mph, then we scratch our heads. Why did the author call the car a Pinto? Wouldn't it be easier and better to have called it a Ferrari?<br />When I first started to notice these kinds of incongruities in The Da Vinci Code, I wondered if they were early clues that Robert Langdon, the main protagonist, was a bit delusional, or at least too free and easy with the facts. But it didn't take long to understand that the one who was too free and easy with the facts was the author.	2003-08-05

But the book remains a tightly constructed and fast-paced story, interesting without being complicated. Basically, classic pulp fiction.<br />Admittedly, advances in cloning in recent years make the characters who never heard of the subject seem a bit dim by modern standards. And the old-fashioned communications methods (e.g., having an operator call you back in order to place an international call, or misunderstanding things because connections are so bad) seem almost contrived. Even the Cold War-type mentality can at first seem cartoonish. But remember that this is taking place in 1974-75 ... that's the way it was.<br />I first read the book around 20 years ago and I remembered enjoying it well enough. Recently, I picked it up again when I wanted something easy to read on train journey, and it was just what I needed: absorbing without the thought that would require me to resent the porter when he came by to check my ticket.

But instead of focusing on that, Merda is content to be little more than a list of ways to accuse someone of practicing the world's oldest profession, and new methods to refer to defecation in every day conversation. Instead of using insight, it relies on shock value.<br />Sadly, it also confuses some regional phrases with true Italian, and there are more than a handful of translation errors.<br />It is true that much of the information contained on the book's pages is difficult to come across without hanging out with i ragazzi after dusk on a street corner in Naples, but it could have been so much more.<br />Combine those fatal shortcomings with poor quality given its price (it's produced using newsprint between two flimsy covers), and you end up with a product with little to recommend it.	2003-08-02

Even the title Mr. Paulos selected became part of the country's every day lexicon, a simple way to refer to the challenge of understanding the way the world is influenced by probabilities, variables, and equations.<br />A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market, to use a metaphor Mr. Paulos might use, falls short of that level by a degree of magnitude.<br />Part of the problem, I will admit, is the high standards set by Innumeracy. If it weren't for that effort, the author's humorous and candid accounts of his own investment failures here (no, math geniuses aren't any better at it than the rest of us) and his clear and easy-to-understand explanations of what the stock market numbers actually reflect would result in a better reception for A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market.<br />Then again, it may have been Innumeracy's success and critical acclaim that allowed A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market to even be published.<br />The actual text checks in at just over 200 pages, and yet the book spends a great deal of time beating around the bush, promising to come back to certain points in the future in several instances, making the slim volume feel more unwieldy than it should. And it is repetitive, using the same story about a stock scam based on mass mailings on three separate occasions. It even shows poor editing: the author can't seem to settle on a single spelling for the bankrupt consulting firm Arthur Andersen, or is it Arthur Anderson?<br />Yes, there are lessons to be learned in A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market: investing is complicated, for example, and a strategy of diversification and investment in simple index funds can yield strong results. But a reader doesn't have to delve into A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market to glean these nuggets of wisdom -- they are just as available in the Sunday newspaper's investment columns and from any number more complete investment guides.<br />In this book, Mr. Paulos warns again and again that he made an error by not judging the financial results of WorldCom, the company whose failure forms the centerpiece of this book, objectively enough. It's an important point; he wanted the company to succeed and so he failed to recognize evidence to the contrary. And it's a lesson that people who buy this book because of the esteem they have for Mr. Paulos after reading Innumeracy and other efforts will wish they applied to their decisions on book buying as well as stock buying.arket to glean these nuggets of wisdom -- they are just as available in the Sunday newspaper's investment columns and from any number more complete investment guides. <br />In this book, Mr. Paulos warns again and again that he made an error by not judging the financial results of WorldCom, the company whose failure forms the centerpiece of this book, objectively enough.

But anyone reading this book with that approach will walk away disappointed.<br />The volume, originally published in Spanish under the name Lo que Varguitas no Dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), is designed to fill in some of the blanks in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter from the perspective of Aunt Julia herself. And it does do that, especially regarding topics related to the somewhat rushed ending to Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter and the events that took place immediately after the narrative ends.<br />But Julia Urquidi never pretended to be the writer that Mr. Vargas Llosa is, and that is very apparent here. Unfortunately, that problem is even exaggerated in the English-language edition of the book, which is translated so that it has a bit of a textbook feel to it. Also, one gets the impression that while Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (like most novels) is first and foremost designed to be a compelling story, My Life With Mario Vargas Llosa is instead part apology and part revenge. The story line often feels like an afterthought.<br />Apologists for this book claim that where the two volumes overlap, My Life With Mario Vargas Llosa is usually far more accurate. That may be true, but without the fanciful and gripping pace and style of Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, few people will read this book closely enough to notice.<br />Another complaint: because the book is scarce, the price is high enough that potential readers should think twice before buying.<br />But I don't mean to make it sound like My Life With Mario Vargas Llosa is without merit, because that would not be fair.<br />The book offers fans of Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter bits and pieces of information that in the end can add another layer of enjoyment to the original tale. We find that Mr. Vargas Llosa's rise to fame and fortune was not nearly as meteoric as he makes it sound, for example, and we discover that the fascinating Pedro Camacho was for the most part on a serial writer called Ra&uacute;l Salm&oacute;n (who is even quoted in the book). Ms. Urquidi even raids the family photo album to publish a handful of black and white images that show us what most of the main characters looked like in real life.<br />If you are a big fan of Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (as I am), then I think My Life With Mario Vargas Llosa is probably a worthwhile addition to your bookshelf. For anyone else, I'd suggest using your time and money on something else.s meteoric as he makes it sound, for example, and we discover that the fascinating Pedro Camacho was for the most part on a serial writer called Raúl Salmón (who is even quoted in the book).

Now I finally understand what they were laughing about.<br />I first realized I was interested in the nature of stupidity after reading a few editions of the Darwin Awards, the silly Internet mailings that detailed the adventures of people who died in stupid ways, or, as the creators of the awards put it, &quot;improve our gene pool ... by removing themselves from it.&quot; But while The Encyclopedia of Stupidity honors that style (it even includes a brief discussion of the Darwin Awards), it goes beyond that.<br />In sum: if it's not impossible to be clever about stupidity, then that's exactly what author Matthijs van Boxsel manages to do.<br />On the most obvious level, this substantial volume is a simple collection of trivia, anecdotes, and ruminations. But as you read through example after example drawn from everything between myth and history to popular culture and dark humor, it becomes clear that there is a sort of &quot;theory of stupidity&quot; that binds the whole thing together.<br />Mr. van Boxsel at one point frames stupidity as &quot;unwitting self-destruction, the ability to act against one's best wishes.&quot; In other words, the book seems to be telling us, the trait the book disects is not a lack of intelligence but a very human kind of flawed or mistaken intelligence, the darkness that makes the light true intelligence visible.<br />The book is more funny than serious, though there are bits of both styles on its pages. And like any encyclopedia, it is more fun to just open up to a random page and read what is there than it is to read from cover to cover. Enjoy.	2003-07-10

In a strict sense, of course, a terrorist is simply someone who uses terror to achieve his aims. But isn't that what armies do? Is someone on the ground during a bombing raid any less terrified than the people running around Manhattan on Sept. 11?<br />Most likely, the real definition is that a terrorist is someone who uses terror to achieve his aims *and* who has an opposing personal or political philosophy. But doesn't that depend on who is doing the talking?<br />In this book, Walter Laqueur takes a view on defining terrorism that the U.S. Supreme Court took a few years ago when trying to define pornography: a strict definition is impossible, he writes, but most of us recognize it when we see it.<br />Unlike most people, I am not convinced by that view. In fact, I think it is use of this imperfect word that makes understanding some of the complex issues in the world extremely difficult: Hamas, the PLO, and Israel, for example, all label their bloody clashes as a battle against terrorism. Ditto for the two sides involved in \\"the troubles\\" in Northern Ireland, and for the bitter standoffs between oppressive governments and student movements in Iran and China. Haven't U.S. and Western European militaries in recent years been labeled terrorists by local populations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Sudan, and Sierra Leone? If the word existed then, would 18th century revolutionaries in North America and France have been called terrorists as well?<br />A less central criticism: Mr. Laqueur is clearly more of a scholar than a stylist. Though that is what you'd want for a study of this kind, his writing style can seem plodding, unnecessarily dense and very often difficult to interpret, especially when putting issues into a historical context. Be prepared to read some passages more than once to get their meaning.<br />But while I cannot agree with Mr. Laqueur's popularly held view as to the definition of terrorism and I do not admire his writing skills, I cannot fault his in-depth and often counter-intuitive analysis as to the origins of what most of the western world sees as terrorism.<br />While most commentators see most guerilla movements as a product of poverty and the absence of democracy, Mr. Laqueur points out that the 20th century's most repressive regimes -- Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany -- did not suffer from significant grassroot insurgencies. In South America, he informs us, the first post-colonial guerilla organization bloomed in democratic Uruguay rather than under Pinochet in Chile or Peron in Argentina. In more recent years, he notes that all of them men involved in the Sept. 11 attacks -- including Osama bin Laden himself -- all came from the relative freedom of comfortable middle class upbringings and most were quite wealthy.<br />Mr. Laqueur's background as a historian is most evident in the way he dissects the differences between anarchists and radicals who flourished among European intellectuals in the 19th century, the freedom and liberation movements from the early 20th century, and more recent terror movements that are usually associated with religion or life philosophies. The first two, he writes, were limited by rationality, while the most recent incarnations are far less constrained and based more on a hatred of something than a desire for something.<br />Near the end, Mr. Laqueur predicts that it is modernity that will eventually transform the Arab world, not wealth or democracy. Although that may sound like an argument in semantics, it is different because modernity includes beliefs and philosophies rather than just external conditions -- a premise that is sure to spark howls of protest from thinkers who see the Arab world as different but not inferior or less evolved than the western world.<br />The book's conclusion is its most chilling point: the path to modernity is really a race against religious fanatics' quest to obtain biological or nuclear weapons.

As I write this, I find myself in the unusual position of criticizing the thick volume even though I turn to it for information on a regular basis.<br />My biggest complaint is that I feel the book doesn't really know what it wants to be. On the one hand, it is a comprehensive reference book that in many areas goes into more depth than other general wine books. But it falls short as a reference book because it lacks the scope of books like The World Atlas of Wine or The Global Encyclopedia of Wine, which cover more up-and-coming wine producing countries, more specific producers and, especially in the case of The World Atlas of Wine, are enhanced by beautiful photographs and maps. Though the Wine Bible is substantial (it weighs in at a hefty 910 pages) its design is more compact than the other books I mentioned, and so might make a better travel companion for someone visiting multiple wine producing regions in a single trip. But the lack of good maps makes a supplemental book necessary.<br />Additionally, the book can feel like a disjointed collection of articles that ought to have been better integrated before publication. Often, the same information (referring to multiple or confusing names for grape varieties or regions, or quality standards in specific countries) is referred to parenthetically several times, often in quick succession -- something unnecessary, especially given the book's excellent glossary.<br />But despite these criticisms, I find myself referring to the book repeatedly. Part of the reason for that is author Karen MacNeil's pleasing and unpretentious writing style, which somehow manages to please wine lovers of many different levels of knowledge. Ms. MacNeil's passion for wine comes through in the text and her knowledge of the subject is extremely impressive, with her descriptions often compensating for a lack of quality photos. And though I would like to see more wine producing areas covered by the book, the regions she does address are covered extremely comprehensively. The quality of information is also very even: before travels to these areas I have read the book's sections on South Africa, the Mosel, Loire, Ribera del Duero, Languedoc, as well as everything on my adopted home country, and could not detect any ebb in Ms. Mac Neil's enthusiasm or knowledge.<br />After some thought, I settled on four stars for this review, despite the complaints I have. The book is just too useful and too skillfully written for fewer stars. The next addition, I feel sure, will earn five on my improvised scale.<br />Once you have moved beyond the most basic level in wine knowledge, this is an important book to have. If you can buy only one book on the subject, this is not the one I would suggest -- The World Atlas of Wine gets my vote for that honor -- but if you were to limit your collection to two books, then I think this is a serious candidate for that second position. Once you've got that much covered, I'd lean toward a book that focuses on your favorite wine producing region or another specific aspect of the subject, like tasting or wine production.or a lack of quality photos.

But just because I didn't anticipate this charming and inspiring love story doesn't mean I didn't thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />Though I have been a fan of Dorothy Gaiter and John Brecher's Wall Street Journal wine column for the last couple of years, I only knew the bits and pieces about their personal lives that I had gathered from reading their Friday installments. But while the column is about wine and it includes small asides about the couple's lives, this book turns the formula around and we find out much more about the writers in a lovely story where wine is an important but junior partner.<br />Each chapter is named after a bottle of wine that they enjoyed at that point in their lives, and a reader knowledgeable about wine will recognize that as their taste in wine became more sophisticated their bond to each other was becoming more profound.<br />The book is a light read -- please don't expect a meaty, intellectual tome -- but that's a big part of its charm. Fans of Ms. Gaiter and Mr. Brecher's column with immediately feel at home with the book's unpretentious and elegant prose, and anyone who picks it up should find him or herself immediately immersed in a story as simple and well made as some of the surprising wines they discover early in the book.	2003-06-17

This was a guy who tried to construct a vocabulary without using the letter &quot;s&quot; so that he could mask his lisp. As a child, he hilariously tells us, his midget guitar teacher had a voice like a recording played back too fast and he taught his students to love their guitars by suggesting they imagine them as a &quot;stacked&quot; woman. And that's just in the first two (short) chapters.<br />But suddenly, the same sharp commentary that had me laughing out loud in public a few chapters earlier started to seem predictable, and the sarcastic wit I identified with early on had somehow eroded into a grating kind of pessimism.<br />Fortunately, I put the book aside and read something else for a few days. When I picked it up again, it again seemed fresh and bitingly comical. And then I realized what I now think is essential to enjoying Mr. Sedaris' work: it needs to small bites in order to be digested correctly.<br />So I end up with three stars -- an average between the two stars I would give it had I read the book straight through and the four I think it deserves when it comes in drips and drabs. I can't agree with my fellow reviewers who consider Mr. Sedaris a modern day Mark Twain or P.G. Wodehouse, but he is pretty damn funny. Just remember, like most things, the key is moderation.	2003-06-03

I won't go so far as to say it renders the other's irrelevant -- the Wine Bible is also quite good, and several books on have that are more narrowly focused on specific countries or regions are essential to me -- but this is the one that explains the most about more subjects.<br />It should not be surprising: Hugh Johnson has produced four editions of the book before this one, and the addition of the wonderful Jancis Robinson just solidifies the Atlas' place atop of the heap of wine literature. This great looking and easy-to-read book is pleasing in so many ways: its delightful photos and large format make it a great coffee table book; the detailed maps and region-by-region explanations make it a good travel companion; and the text's lively anecdotes and density of information virtually make the volume a thrilling page-turner. It is at once accessible enough for beginners and informative enough for experts.<br />No, it is not perfect. As with any comprehensive wine book, some will complain that certain remote (and perhaps up-and-coming) wine producing regions have been left out or glossed over. And despite improvements from previous editions (thanks to Ms. Robinson, I believe), there is still some of the crusty and old-fashioned wine lingo that often intimidates the uninitiated.<br />So with what amount to only minor caveats, I wholeheartedly recommend the World Atlas of Wine. Get it and you will never feel the same about the wine you drink again.	2003-05-25

But it necessarily suffers from the problems that any writer addressing current events and people still in power suffers from: the knowledge that what is written will have an impact on the way the writer is treated and the access he is given in the future.<br />That is especially true of Bob Woodward. Dating back nearly 30 years to when he and partner Carl Bernstein famously made names for themselves by uncovering much of the Watergate scandal, Mr. Woodward's strength has always been his ability to track down information rather than a talent for putting events into perspective. With Bush at War, I could almost feel certain editorial decisions being made to protect that access to information above all else.<br />In fact, some of that access seems to have been limited despite the care he took. In painting a picture of the president's decision-making, the book is notably light on first-hand information from Vice President Dick Cheney or Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, for example, and much heavier on the views of Secretary of State Colin Powell.<br />That imbalance is not ideal, but it does present one of its unlikely strong points: while the views of the hawkish Cheney/Rumsfeld faction of the White House's advisory team are well known (because they were turned into action on the battlefield and on the diplomatic front) Mr. Woodward's efforts here give us an interesting perspective on what might have been had the more multilateralist and tactful Secretary Powell had his way.	2003-05-21

I took it down for a friend to borrow, but before I would let it out of the house, I found time to re-re-read odd pages and passages, followed, of course, by a fair share of laughing out loud and shaking my head in wonder.<br />The book isn't a biography as much as it is a simple collection of anecdotes. But when the anecdotes come from somebody with the story telling ability, the smarts and the optimism of Mr. Feynman, then that is plenty.<br />To be fair, each time I re-read the book, it seems a little more dated -- not in the charming sense of old-fashioned values like wearing your best suit for a Sunday afternoon stroll and saving love letters in a box tied together by twine, but in the sense of context. We have to remember, for example, that the price Mr. Feynman paid for a bottle of champagne at one point would be a small fortune if it were stated in today's dollars, and that traveling from New York to Los Angeles was not something one could do on a moment's notice, as it is today. More seriously, Mr. Feynman's treatment of women -- as objects to be conquered and as the gender that \\"owes\\" men something in return for a couple of drinks or a dinner -- will today seem politically incorrect to people who dwell on those things.<br />But there is too much great stuff between the book's covers to let those kinds of minor problems stand in the way.<br />Of all the qualities Mr. Feynman shares about himself on the book's pages, the one that I like the most is his child-like curiosity: he seems to want to know everything how every thing works. Friends tell me I'm a bit like that myself and when I first made that connection I wondered if it was one of the reasons I was so enthralled by Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman -- and its follow-up, What Do You Care What Other People Think? -- starting from the moment I first picked it up and clear through many re-readings and many more years.

Before reading Empire, I had him placed in my mind as an eccentric and enjoyable young historian and the author of sometimes inaccessible historical tomes that -- if you could make it through them -- often gave innovative takes to what had been tired subjects.<br />I cannot say that I agree with everything in previous efforts from Mr. Ferguson: in The Pity of War, for example, one of his main points was that Germany was not militaristic before the first world war. And in The House of Rothschild (his best book), I believe Mr. Ferguson's take on the French family judges them to harshly by using today's standards on a 19th century history. But with Empire, the author appears to have completely lost his hold on reality.<br />Mr. Ferguson spends most of the book's 352 glossy pages glossing over some of the atrocities of Britain's colonial period (he does not claim it was faultless, only that the spilled blood was necessary). He argues for the virtues of colonial rule in India, and spends far too little time and effort on the policies that set the stage for apartheid in South Africa. He says that the money and technology the empire spread balanced out the evils committed in colonial Africa and parts of Asia and the Caribbean. But this is all just setting the stage for his argument about the current American empire, and the lessons it can learn from Britain's former position as the world's lone superpower.<br />The issue of America's role in the world using history as a guide is an important and interesting subject -- and I enjoyed reading Mr. Ferguson's argument that, as a former British colony, the U.S. is a kind of heir to Britain's empire. But his appalling conclusion is that the U.S. should tighten its grip of influence on the world and make its self into an empire in more ways than the simple economic, social and military dominance it has now. What? Isn't America's might and unilateral policies what sparked anti-Americanism across the globe? If the U.S. followed the British example, wouldn't the kind of uprisings and insurgencies that crippled it at its peak be many times worse now, when combined with modern technology?<br />This book is not designed to be read on its own, but as a companion to a BBC television series. I have not seen the series, but I must imagine that certain topics were selected and highlighted because they made good television. I don't know how that explains Mr. Ferguson's dangerous conclusions, but I am gripping at straws here. I guess I don't want to believe that a writer I have admired in the past has really become so distasteful.sm across the globe?

But the book will illustrate the most basic and most important rules of grammar in a way that has given generations of writers the foundation and the tools they needed to develop their individual styles.<br />It has become a classic of English grammar, something that must seem an unlikely niche. When you see those back cover shots of authors with massive bookshelves behind them, you'll be surprised how many will include this thin volume. Even the compact and no-nonsense title has become part of the modern world's literary lexicon: look on Amazon to see how many books are called \\"The Elements of Style of\\" Something, whether it's Java script or e-mail lingo or architecture or the Unified Modeling Language.<br />I am still using the third edition to this book, which was first published nearly 25 years ago. I glanced through the new fourth edition a few days ago and noticed the glossary of obscure grammar terms added to the back. I thought about getting it, but the glossary wasn't enough to persuade me to retire my old dog-eared copy with its underlined passages and comments in the margins that date back to my high school days. If you have an older edition, it's likely you already know the value of these elements of style, and so it's your call whether it's worth upgrading to the new book with its glossary. But if you don't have this book, then that is a problem with only one solution.	2003-05-13

With this book, he seems intent on singing the same song years after the curtain was drawn.<br />Ostensibly, this is a book about wines -- one of my passions -- and for the first few dozen pages it appears to be just that. There are some interesting and unusual observations about wine on the pages of Bacchus & Me, and Mr. McInerney deserves credit (hence the three stars) for breaking many of the crusty and useless conventions that limit most wine literature.<br />But the more one reads the book, the more one realizes that the chapters are less about wine than about Mr. McInerney himself. He reveals himself as a shameless name dropper, and someone most interested in repeating a half dozen humorous and entertaining observations in a variety of contexts while boasting about his fat expense account and privileged access to bottles of wine that most of us will never even see.<br />The problem is not that these lines are uninteresting or irrelevant -- as an occasional aside they would add to the intriguing take on one of the world's most written-about subjects. But in the frequency in which they appear here they can leave a throbbing in the head like an old bottle of jug wine does, when what we really wanted was one of those fine bottles of Bordeaux Mr. McInerney seems to be in love with.	2003-04-30

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	From the soapbox	For many readers fortunate enough to have read the Lord of the Rings books before the recent string of well-done movies, J.R.R. Tolkein's timeless masterworks are what defined fantasy, dreams, possibility. The books will always be one of the cornerstones of my literary foundation.<br />I saw the first of the movies when it came out in 2001 and I can find only one criticism with it. The casting was good, the acting crisp, the cinematography inspired. But it was not as good as the book, and it could never be as good as the book. This, of course, speaks more to Mr. Tolkein's gifts than it does to any shortcomings of the motion picture, but it couldn't be more relevant.<br />I'll step up on the soapbox for a moment and say that while good films like the Lord of the Rings succeed and showing viewers the limits of the directors' and screenwriters' substantial imaginations, they by definition fail at helping to stretch the limits of the viewer's. And that's what Mr. Tolkein's books did so well for me and generations of other readers.<br />This is not a problem invented by the Lord of the Rings, and it probably would exist in substantially the same form if neither the books nor the movies had been produced. But the phenomenon -- which appears to be producing a generation that thinks in clich&eacute;s and spurns originality -- seems especially acute in this case simply because the Lord of the Rings is such an important work.<br />Mr. Tolkein's unforgettable Middle Earth can only exist in the mind: the complexities of the histories, traditions, panoramas and inhabitants go far beyond anything possible anywhere else. Yet instead of being abstract, it is full of the type of allegory that is relevant to our lives in a highly personal way.<br />What all this means is that you should read these books. Or re-read them. Or re-re-read them. Or introduce them to someone else. And if you manage to do so before you or the reader has seen the films, then you will have succeeded in opening up a new world that could not exist without the books, and you will have done so before the Big Screen can dictate how it's all supposed to look, feel, sound and behave.g up a new world that could not exist without the books, and you will have done so before the Big Screen can dictate how it's all supposed to look, feel, sound and behave.	2003-04-15

This books weighs in at a hefty 400 pages, and it would have benefited from a filter of some kind that would have cut out half of the text by eliminating many of the second, third and fourth examples that illustrate the same points and dull the impact of Mr. Entine's relevant and valuable research and conclusions.<br />I am not a physiologist, but as a middle distance runner at the university level, a sports journalist for nearly a decade and a keen observer for longer than that, I have seen nothing to make me disagree with Mr. Entine's main points. I do agree with the arguments of those who say there are also cultural factors at play, but to deny the genetic part of the equation does not stand to reason. The opposing view would assume that all types of talent were somehow evenly distributed among the genetic groups.<br />If that were the case, why are so many great runners from Kenya and Ethiopia but not from, say, Uganda or Zimbabwe (or Mongolia or Bolivia), where conditions are similar but the genetic makeup is different? In the U.S., why do inner city white kids succeed in basketball less often than inner city black kids? From another angle, why, for example, is it rare to see great black swimmers or gymnists, even in proportion to their participation?<br />That said -- and Mr. Entine makes this point as well, albeit in passing and with some conditions -- none of that gives support to the simple-minded people who write off the accomplishments of successful athletes by pointing to their genetic head start. In global sports competitions that are usually decided by fractions of seconds and millimeters, nobody can succeed without dedication, hard work and discipline at a level that is unfathomable to most of the rest of us.<br />The point here is that among those who gather the strength and will to work that hard, a few will stand out because of their genetic advantages, and they are the ones who usually go home with the gold medals. Of course, this does not mean that great champions cannot come from other genetic groups, only that this will happen less often. And these great champions should not be looked down upon for who they are, but celebrated -- they represent the best of what humankind can muster in a specific area, just the same as Mozart, or Einstein, or Shakespeare.cation, hard work and discipline at a level that is unfathomable to most of the rest of us. <br />The point here is that among those who gather the strength and will to work that hard, a few will stand out because of their genetic advantages, and they are the ones who usually go home with the gold medals.

But it is the way they mesh together that is part of the magic in this book. Without giving away the story line here, let it suffice to say that at certain points you'll find yourself smiling and flipping back through the pages uttering \\"but didn't he...\\" or \\"I thought that...\\"<br />The story itself offers a fascinating look at several aspects of life in Peru, one of the most complex and interesting countries in the world. But it does it effortlessly; using a love-torn teenage protagonist, a sexy older woman, an enraged father, an eccentric serial writer, and a compelling cast of misfit radio artists.<br />Though certain parts (especially the story of Julia) are well documented, the exact extent to which some of the rest of the book is based on real life is still being debated. Every once in a while in Lima, for example, an obituary will mention that its subject was one of the people the unforgettable Pedro Camacho might have been based on, and many old Peruvians have theories about the exact bar or town where certain scenes were set.<br />Like any writer, Vargas Llosa takes certain artistic license and some people have grumbled about inaccuracies in the text. But I shrug off those complaints: a novel is never meant to be an accurate historical document.<br />Nonetheless, if you are intrigued enough by the story in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter to read more and you understand Spanish, the most important and entertaining of the complaints is by Aunt Julia (Julia Urquidi) herself, called Lo Que Varguitas No Dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say).

Sure, Michael Moore is guilty of certain factual misinterpretations combined with a healthy dose of hyperbole, but anyone who has seen his film Roger and Me or glanced at anything he's done since then knows that is the man's job. He is not trying to be objective, he is not trying to pass himself off as an intellectual, and he did not submit this book in article form to Foreign Affairs. He is simply trying make readers ask themselves some questions, forcing them to either cheer or shout. And if you glance down this page at the list at the emotion praise or criticisms he sparked, he has done just that.<br />This book is more important than it is great. Moore's insight, his talent if you will, is framing complicated problems in a way that is understandable and which forces a response in readers and viewers. Good for him. As far as the complexity of his arguments go, this is the drinkable house wine, your favorite tee-shirt and jeans, a catchy song you've heard a hundred times. But even if it is simple, familiar and even predictable, it is also important.<br />As Moore points out, issues in the world today are not divided cleanly between good and evil, and in that context a well-stated voice of dissention is often more patriotic than wild cheers and applause. So kudos to Moore for speaking out at a time when we have heard too much of the latter and not enough of the former. As any patriot will say, I may not agree with many of the points the man writes in this easy-to-read book, but I'll defend his right to write them.<br />So liberals, conservatives, libertarians, hawks, doves, anarchists, monarchists, oligarchists, numerologists, astrologists, everyone ... read the book, give yourself a moment to think about it and then come back to this page and tell us what you think.	2003-04-03

It's not even an objective account of Lance Armstrong's life and career. But what it is is more important than all that: the book is an inspiration with few peers. I have read it more than once, and each time I read the last page I close the cover, put the volume aside and think: I can do anything I set my mind to doing.<br />As the title says, the story is not (only) about the bike, as its lessons of hope and perseverance are relevant to anyone facing adversity. But it is probably best enjoyed by those familiar with cycling, since it also offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of someone who does what he does better than anyone else.<br />If there is anyone who doesn't already know the general outline of Lance Armstrong's history, he overcame a deadly battle with cancer to win the Tour de France, considered by some the most grueling and difficult endurance test in the world. And it's a story that is still current: Lance won the tour twice more after the book was published and will be vying for a record-tying fifth title this summer.<br />As I wrote at the beginning, don't buy this book if you want a philosophical tome about overcoming a life-threatening illness, or a spin-free look at the complex life of an athlete who is probably still under appreciated in his home country and at once admired and resented in Europe, where he spends most of his time. But if you want an easy-to-read real-life story to inspire you and illustrate what is possible -- and what could be more important than that? -- this is the book you want.	2003-04-02

He should have called this book, the 1989 followup, Big Print Thick Paper.<br />Instead, he called it Story of My Life, which is just as well, since the protagonist, Alison, must utter that phrase 500 times. That in itself is a major factor in helping the fluff stretch out over 180 or 190 pages or so, but it doesn't help the narrative avoid sounding as if most of it appeared in word balloons over the heads of the main characters, like in a 1950s-style Real Life comic book.<br />It's easy to write this book off as a product of the tail end of the most decadent decade in the U.S. since the Jazz Age (though the 1920s did at least give us some extraordinary literature), and there may be something to that point of view. But I choose to see it as the swan song of a self-indulgent literary style whose time had come before it really began and a writer whose success would have been impossible at any other point in history. In that respect, Story of My Life has some value as a sort of literary time capsule, a curious reminder of a time we'd rather forget. But is it worth reading now? Ask yourself this: what did Jay McInerney write next? Where did his career rise to after this exercise? If you know the answer, you get my point.	2003-04-01

Why start reading a book when you already know how it ends? When the movie already gives you a mental picture of what the characters are like? When it would be impossible to read the description of a scene, a conversation, an expression, or a mood without thinking first of the director's and screenwriter's interpretation of those things?<br />I stand by that view, but I also suggest throwing it out the window when it comes to The Pianist.<br />I was so moved by the film that when I saw this book in a store, I could not help but pick it up. Once in my hands, I could not help but read the first few lines. Once I read them, I could not help but buy the book. And once I bought it, the next day and a half of my life was dominated by the chilling, horrible, graphic and compelling story.<br />I won't go into an overview of the plot, since my fellow reviewers have covered that territory very accurately. But I will say that this is a rare case where the value of a book is not compromised by the movie -- the story is so well told and the details (most of which the movie screenwriter was forced to leave out) are so evocative and potent that they flow over and around any preconceived notions.<br />The film is well done, and by all means it should be seen. But don't let seeing the movie deprive you of the pleasure of this powerful book, which illustrates once again what we have known all along -- that great literature succeeds where other art forms fall short.	2003-03-25

While the Rome guide obviously lacks the vastness of the national editions, it is the best available English-language resource for anyone in the Eternal City looking to find a great meal at a restaurant that isn't already listed in every other guide book.<br />Granted, this book suffers from some of the shortcomings of the Gambero Rosso series as a whole: it generally doesn't reward restaurants that do something out of the ordinary, no matter how good, and the growing sector of ethnic and fusion restaurants in the capital are ignored. One might even criticize the choice of Rome for Gambero Rosso's first English-language restaurant guide, since Florence, Bologna and Genoa all have culinary traditions superior to that of Rome (no doubt Rome's 30 million tourists a year were the deciding factor there). But for any ex-pat living in Rome or any English-speaking visitor who wants some solid advice on where to eat his or her tripa or tagliateli, this is the book you want.	2003-03-19

I first became interested in Italian hand gestures after I read that a key soccer game was once lost because the coach explained (complete with hand gestures) what he wanted an incoming player to do. Once the player was in the game, the opposing coach (who saw but did not hear the plan) was able to stop it.<br />What's not to love?<br />This is the best of several books on the subject, and it can be treated as pure entertainment or something to study before a trip to the 'bel paese' -- it works well in both contexts. The gestures are clearly explained, and the subject matter skillfully stays clear of the ridicule or overly comic elements that plague some similar efforts.<br />My take: there's hardly a more interesting way to prepare for a trip to Italy than to open a bottle of dolcetto and practice these gestures with your travel partner.<br />A side note: Italians get a big friendly laugh from forigners who accurately use their hand gestures!	2003-03-19

I have read several of Edward de Bono's books in recent years and I enjoy his theories. Which is why I recently dished out a lot of monet for the Why So Stupid book that is supposedly his magnum opus and is available only by direct mail. And after reading it, I will report that most of what is there for a very high price is also in this book and in de Bono's Thinking Course, which can be had for around 4% of that cost -- if that isn't worth a 5-star rating, what is?<br />The more expensive book does illustrate a more evolved form of de Bono's theories, and they are applied in more situations (including many that are relevant to the world today). But my advice is to by this book or the Thinking Course -- both are excellent primers on de Bono's excellent ideas.	2003-03-17

What kind of writing reads best with sans serif type? Why do editors tell you the name of the font at the end of some books? What is the rationale of putting the page numbers on the top versus the bottom of the page? Is there a maximum weight for a book? Or, in this case, a minimum? Why so many blank pages at the end?<br />But halfway through A Box of Matches I began to wonder about larger questions, almost none of them good: Is this literature? Is it even fiction? Can a story exist without conflict? Without antagonists? With no plot? Only one multi-dimensional character?<br />I have always applauded Baker for pushing the boundaries a little more each time out, but he went too far in A Box of Matches. As a writer, he has a world-class gift for describing minor events perfectly and crisply. But isn't there a limit to how minor minor can get? Couldn't he have found something more worthwhile to use his talents on?<br />I kept waiting for some kind of O Henry ending or the sudden realization that Emmit, the self-absorbed main character, had somehow evolved. Anticipating what might happen made the book pass faster, but those sorts of developments aren't Baker's style. In retrospect, the book seems like the literary equivalent to recording an Opera star singing scales before a show.<br />No, no, no. Go back and read The Fermata, The Mezzanine, U &I, even Double Fold (his wonderful non-fiction debut) and save yourself from this Book of Matches. If Baker wants to publish his writing exercises, nothing says we have to read them.	2003-03-12

The general subject matter is at once irreverent and relevant to the world we are in today, and the insight into human nature is timeless.<br />Without giving away the story, the end of the book is biblical, one way or another. I see it as apocalyptic, which is an easy interpretation, but a friend sees similarities with the Great Flood, a cleansing event. Now I wonder if the first and last books of the Bible have more in common than I first thought. Thanks, Kurt, John, Ice-9.<br />For those who don't know much about Vonnegut himself, the man never meant to become one of the leading writers of his generation. He was a short story writer in the 1940s and 1950s, when that was still a viable profession, and he turned to novels reluctantly. According to his biographies and interviews he's given, he saw himself as a simple story teller, a catalyst for readers to live in a different reality for a few pages, to chuckle a little on the bus home. But his longevity, the importance of the then-contemporary issues he has written about and the impact he had on generations of young people (who later became middle aged and then old people while remaining influenced by the writer from Indianapolis) have solidified Vonnegut's place in the American literary canon, and Cat's Cradle is the best example of his work.<br />Enjoy.	2003-02-24
US	52000975	R1S09ODBYK6CNQ	0312420277	278415393	The Feast of the Goat: A Novel	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A feast for the mind	This is a highly personal book for me: I am half Dominican and a relative of one of the minor characters portrayed in the book, and I grew up hearing first-hand stories about the Trujillo regime. Additionally, I have been an avid reader of Vargas Llosa's books for several years starting during a span of several years when I lived in Peru, the author's home country. Because of that, I put off reading the book for several months, fearing that it might not live up to the possibly unreasonable expectations I had built up.<br />But those fears melted away within a few pages of starting the book, with the compelling story of Urania, the protagonist in one of the three major story lines that fill the pages of the novel. In retrospect, the story of Urania seems to be the weakest of the three lines (it is also the only one that is mostly fiction, though it can be seen as a amalgam of several real events with some artistic license thrown in), but that is more a statement about the strength of the story about the dictator's eventual murderers and (most notably) the one about Trujillo than it is a weakness about Urania's tale.<br />The story is gritty and intense, riveting and important -- an examination into a 31-year dictatorship that much of the world is unaware of, as well as a fascinating probe into the minds of people who lived under extraordinary circumstances. Without a doubt, The Feast of the Goat will solidify Vargas Llosa's place among Latin America's literary giants like Garcia Marquez, Neruda, Borges, Paz and Allende.	2003-01-20

Why, why, why base a book on a piece of history which, in itself was fascinating and gripping, and then strip it of factual integrity and relevance and make a romantic slush of it all?<br />From the very beginning the nasty term \\"the host country\\" tried to put us off the scent that Patchett was basing her story in Peru 1996-97. Fine if she was going to create her own set where these relationships blossom against all odds. But then she seemed determined to conjure tropical appeal into the text (I won't call it prose) with stereotypical descriptions of Peruvian jungle life, and the garua fogs that are inextricably linked to Lima and no other city.<br />The obvious reason for the desire to distance herself from the nail-biting siege at the Japanese embassy is to clear the way to delve into siege mentality. But linking the surroundings so obviously to Peru distracts from that. Sprinkle in the factually wrong details that jolt you out of what little suspension of disbelief you'd managed to achieve and the whole structure of this book is self-defeating.<br />Which brings us to the characters. The fact that Gen is supposed to be able to speak quite so many languages is remarkable but once the tally nudges over five distinct language groups, it frankly erodes the verisimilitude one can only presume patchett was aiming for. He is the lynchpin of this book without which there would be no communication but he was stretched too far. That said, he comes across as a sympathetic character in the widest sense of the word and has a certain emotional appeal until the last few pages. If this sharp mind is so blunted because of the siege's end then that is potentially fascinating psychology and needs to be examined. Not to do so just jars.<br />There were some nice touches in this book and the middle section ran with some ease but those positives were outweighed by irritations and silly stereotypes.<br />This was a book idea that had potential but having read to the end on a long train journey, I was left wondering if patchett had ever been to Peru. Had she read a wide range of accounts of the embassy siege? Had she talked to any survivors of a hostage crisis? Had she spoken to any psychologists? Or was this just a romantic dream she found a home for?<br />(Post Scriptum -- fellow critics of this book, Bel Canto does NOT fit into magical realism. Magical realism is a serious literary genre where your suspension of disbelief is wooed into a higher realm of irreality where people can float into the sky at a moment's notice without it seeming strange, where libraries can stretch to eternity, where modern lives can be subsumed into myth. Bel Canto is not magical realism. It is mundane fiction.)were some nice touches in this book and the middle section ran with some ease but those positives were outweighed by irritations and silly stereotypes.<br />This was a book idea that had potential but having read to the end on a long train journey, I was left wondering if patchett had ever been to Peru.

But I found the book uneven at best -- and it's now gathering dust on my bookshelf.<br />The problem is that the so-called &quot;secrets&quot; the book uncovers are dominated by sites and histories that anyone who has been to Rome more than once or twice would have already heard about or stumbled upon. In many cases, they are so obvious -- Ever heard of the Imperial Forum? Does St. Peter's ring a bell? -- that it was hardly worth wading through it to find the few really worthwhile suggestions.<br />That said, none of the recommendations are unworthy of attention. It's only that the title &quot;city secrets&quot; seems to imply something for the more advanced visitor or resident. Instead, a large minority of the secrets are available from any general guidebook.<br />The recommendations reflect that eclectic group of contributors who collaborated to produce the volume. But it would have benefited enormously from a finer filter that could weed out the most obvious places. Of course, that would have left enough for a good airline magazine story and not a book.	2001-09-02
