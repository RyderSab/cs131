Some of those books are quite good.  \\"The Zanzibar Chest: A Story of Life, Love, and Death in Foreign Lands\\" by Aidan Hartley, at first glance, seems to be another journalist-memoir of this sort.  It is that, but it is much more.  Mr. Hartley weaves many threads into a tapestry of his life in Africa: There are the memoirs of a journalist who covered Africa's big stories of the 1990s (Somalia, Rwanda, AIDS, etc.).  There is also the behind-the-scenes story of being a journalist, the psychic toll it takes, office politics, the dangers and disappointments of journalism, and plenty of boozing and whoring.  There are the stories of Mr. Hartley's parents and ancestors (ex-pats and colonial officials) and the story of the life and death of one of his father's friends.  Finally, the story of how all of this affects Mr. Hartley's private life, his career, his home, his love affairs.  All of it is told with a clarity and clear purpose that makes this much more than a book.  It is a window into a world.  Great.  Very highly recommended.  Books not 1/10 as good have sold more copies.  Too bad.	2004-02-03

It teaches counting, and tells the story of a South African child, her family, and their garden, and a seed that grows into a plant and yields a harvest of pumpkin that is made into . . . Isijingi. There are actually three texts in this book that can be read separately or together: the counting text; the story of the seed; and background about South African family life. The book is illustrated with a couple dozen color photographs, and also includes a map of Africa and South Africa.  This book teaches more than counting, something just as valuable: a look at another people and their culture.  Younger children will like the counting text, with its large font and big pictures, slightly older children will appreciate learning about South Africa, its people and food.	2004-01-18

The illustrations are large, colorful, and detailed.  The book begins with morning and ends at night and depicts people having breakfast, going to school, doing housework, shopping, playing, etc.  The emphasis is always on modern people (not wildlife, not \\"exotic\\" tribes).

This book is not focused on its supposed subject (Emma McCune, a one-time British aid worker who married a Sudanese &quot;warlord&quot;), and its many excursions into other seemingly related topics somehow distract more than enlighten.  A very good editor could have made this a much better book.  As it is, I can only recommend it to people who are very, very interested in the aid biz or Sudan.  I am sure that there are many other books on these subjects that would be more useful to the general reader.	2003-06-17

Petterson was the only U.S. State Department official who was there the entire time. He tells the story of the various political players on all sides: the \\"Arab\\" rulers and elites who lost power; and the \\"African\\" revolutionaries who took it; the British officials -- old \\"African hands\\", and the Americans, eager to support democracy but wary of communist influence. Briefly, Zanzibar and its bloody revolution was on the front pages, but soon it was forgotten. Petterson tells of not only the international diplomatic calculations, but also writes about the day-to-day life of a diplomat in a far away place and time, and relates some of the history and atmosphere of a real place that many Americans might equate with Shangra-la or Xanadu. Illustrated with historic photographs. Well worth reading for the East Africa enthusiast or historian of U.S. diplomacy.  And it has a great ending!	2003-05-19

He was an African-American who escaped Jim Crow in the U.S. to become a missionary in Africa.  He co-founded a Christian mission in Africa where they had been none before and for a time ran it single-handedly.  He was also an amateur anthropologist/ethnologist and became the first foreigner to establish contact with the Kuba people of central Africa and to describe their culture to the outside world.  On top of all that, he documented the cruelty of the King Leopold's Congo rule.  Unfortunately, it is not clear that \\"Black Livingstone: A True Tale of Adventure in the Nineteenth-Century Congo\\" by Pagan Kennedy is up to the job of elevating William Sheppard to his rightful place in history.  The book is well written, worth reading, and might be valuable to anyone interested in Africa, the Congo, or Christian missionaries, but a lot of the story is missing and is filled in with generalities from Sheppard's time.  It may be the case that original documents concerning Sheppard's life are lost, and this is the best that can be done, or perhaps another book can do better.  Four stars, but barely.	2003-05-06

Of course, there are measurements provided, but Ms. Council makes clear that adapting the recipes to your liking is part of the learning process.

An additional plus to this cookbook is the introduction by the author which is a mini-biography of her life with food, starting with learning to cook for her family on the farm, then working as \\"domestic help\\" in a white family's kitchen (and inventing a dish on the spot), and finally opening and operating a restaurant that has become an institution.

While the title indicates these are foods found in contemporary Israel, each dish is traditional, originating perhaps in Israel, or more often somewhere else: Germany, Iran, Italy, Libya, Morocco, Turkey, etc., but all a part of the Jewish diaspora and eventual return to multicultural Israel.  The author really tells the story of each dish (there is just as much \\"story\\" as actual recipe): the people that make it, where they come from, how they live, and how the author came to learn it all.  There are lots of historic photographs too.  One slight drawback is that this book is most useful to someone who is an experienced cook, especially one who is familiar with Jewish cuisine.  In a few places where a food or cooking technique may not be familar, it is not as much a step-by-step guide as it could be.  However, this is a minor fault in a very valuable and enjoyable book.	2002-11-21

This coffee-table book is a great choice for armchair travelers and anyone who wants to climb (or has climbed) Africa's highest mountain. The book documents the journey of a party of climbers who accompanied David Breashears and his team as they made an IMAX film about the mountain. Author Audrey Salkeld, who specializes in books about mountaineering, has assembled a great mix of Kilimanjaro ecology, geography, history, lore, and travelogue related to her climb.  The story starts with East Africa's Chagga people and their legends, then moves to missionary Johannes Rebmann whose story of equatorial snow was met with disbelief, then on to the other explorers, and eventually the first (known) mountaineers who climbed the mountain.  Several other authors contributed articles on the Kilimanjaro's relation to the Rift Valley, Missionaries in Africa, Elephants, Mountain Sickness, Film and Literature, Plants, Volcanic History, etc. Very well illustrated with color photographs and historical images, as one would expect from a book published by National Geographic.	2002-10-15

The first half of the book, which looks at the oldest (mostly pre-historic) food traditions, was the most interesting for this reader.  Fernandez-Armesto serves up some interesting &quot;food for thought&quot; on nearly every page, starting with the fact that oysters are just about the only food that is still commonly consumed live in modern times, then some thoughts about what may have been the first animals to be domesticated and raised for food.  The sections dealing with human's transition from hunting to husbandry and gathering to agriculture are insightful.  The author's command of the various literature related to food (not often combined in one text) is impressive.	2002-10-07

He was captured by African slave traders, taken to the Atlantic coast, and sold into the slave trade. He was taken to the Caribbean, then Virginia, and eventually Europe. He served a ship's captain and sailed the Mediterranean and on a voyage to explore the North Pole (Greenland). He obtained his freedom and became an author and early anti-slavery activist. The publication of this book made him the best-selling black African author ever (up to that time). This book became a prototype of the \\"up-from-slavery\\" autobiography (typified by Frederick Douglass) and is a classic among Atlantic slave narratives.<br />The book is autobiographical and arranged chronologically, the author detailing events of his African childhood and his years as a slave and eventual self-emancipation. One notable thing about the book is the extent to which it is a travelogue: Equiano clearly enjoys telling travel tales more than decrying the horrors of slavery. His depictions of being a \\"stranger in a strange land\\" (e.g., the first time he encounters a clock, a painted portrait, books) are memorable.<br />The Norton edition is filled with related texts pertaining to Equiano and his times: articles and excerts by other writers about Africa, slavery, abolition, Equiano's birthplace, his literary influences; a useful map; a diagram of a sailing ship, etc. A good choice among several editions of Equiano's book.	2002-07-16

Burton wrote: <br />&quot;My visits to Mr. Walker [Rev. William Walker, in Gabon] first gave me the idea of making the negro describe his own character in a collection of purely Hamitic proverbs and idioms.  It appeared to me that, if ever a book aspires to the title 'l'Africaine peint par lui-meme' [the African depicted by himself], it must be one in which he is the medium of his own spirit, the interpreter of his own thoughts.  Hence, 'Wit and Wisdom from West Africa' &quot;<br />First published in 1865, &quot;Wit and Wisdom from West Africa&quot; is a collection of roughly 1700 proverbs from seven languages spoken along the Atlantic coast of Africa.  The proverbs were not collected by Burton himself; he complied them from other published sources (mostly missionaries who were working on African language dictionaries and grammar books).  In a few cases Burton had some communication with the collectors whose works he borrowed from.  &quot;Wit and Wisdom from West Africa&quot; contains the following chapters (noted with the original source and number of proverbs):<br />1) Proverbs in the Wolof Tongue (from &quot;Grammaire Wolofe&quot;, by J. Dard, 1826), 226 proverbs.<br />2) Proverbs in the Kanuri Tongue (from &quot;African Native Literature&quot;, by Rev. S.W. Koelle, 1854), 83 proverbs.<BR> <BR>3) Proverbs in the Oji Tongue (from &quot;Grammatical Outline of the Oji Language&quot; by Rev. H.N. Riis, 1854), 265 proverbs.<br />4) Proverbs in the Ga or Accra Language (from &quot;A Grammatical Sketch of the Akra, or Ga, Language&quot;, by Rev. J. Zimmermann, 1858), 221 proverbs.<br />5) Proverbs in the Yoruba Language (from &quot;Grammar and Dictionary of the Yoruba Language&quot; by Rev. T.J. Bowen, 1858) 483 proverbs.<br />6) Proverbs in the Efik or Old Calabar Language (from &quot;A Dictionary of the Efik Language&quot;, by Rev. Hugh Goldie, 1862) 418 proverbs.<br />7) Proverbial Sayings and Idioms in the Mpangwe (Fan) Tongue (collected by Rev. Preston and Rev. Adams) 14 proverbs.<br />Each proverb is printed in its original language (in the Latin alphabet) as well as in English.  Many proverbs have a few sentences of additional commentary.  In a few cases Burton questions the spelling used by the original collectors.  <br />With the strange (to us) mix of admiration and admonition vis-a-vis Africa that characterizes Burton, he provides an introduction to each chapter that discusses each people's (tribe's) geography and history.  It seems clear that Burton was looking for something African to celebrate; and not finding an African Shakespeare or Da Vinci, he settled on proverbs as an African accomplishment worthy of acclaim.<br />These proverbs having been  collected over a century ago, they offer a glimpse into Africa's past; perhaps as Burton wished, a bit of &quot;the African as depicted by himself&quot;.	2002-03-18

Despite focusing on the hot chile pepper in Africa, the &quot;Flavors of Africa Cookbook&quot; does provide an overview of African cooking in about 160 recipes; from the North African tajine to the South African bobotie and all the sauces, soups, stews and curries in between.  There are authentic traditional African recipes featuring such ingredients as plantains, yams, and groundnuts (peanuts) as well as African-inspired fusion cooking from in and out of Africa.  But the African pili-pili, peri-peri, and piri-piri (all African words for chile peppers and dishes made with them) is the star here.  The book's introduction is a history of the chile pepper in Africa.  There is much related to spicy-hot African cookery throughout the book, including advice on exactly which hot chiles to use to obtain the most authentic results.<br />There are just a few things I noticed and wondered about: <br />The general consensus among scientists is that Capsicum (peppers) are native to America and were spread throughout the world in the early years of the age of European exploration. This book states that chile peppers first appeared in North Africa, but were spread to the rest of the continent by Europeans, but there is no further explanation.  Perhaps there is some confusion of the Capsicum with the Aframomum melegueta (or grains of paradise, a pepper-like spice that is native to Africa) or other spices native to Africa.       <br />Poulet (chicken) Gnemboue (or Nyembwe) is a chicken stew made with palm nuts, the fruit of the African oil palm.  It is a dish made in equatorial West Africa, especially Gabon.  People outside of Gabon sometimes substitute hazelnuts, pine nuts, almonds, or peanuts.  In this book, this recipe (with almonds) is called a &quot;North African tajine&quot;.  <br />There are a few mistakes in Swahili: (and I am no expert there, but) I noticed that &quot;Curried Chicken and Banana Soup&quot; is parenthetically titled &quot;Supa Ya N Dizi&quot; which should be &quot;Supa Ya Ndizi&quot;, meaning &quot;Soup of Plantains&quot;.<br />Oftentimes the authors enthusiasm for chile peppers goes a bit too far, leading them to abandon the use of the African names for recipes.  For example, a sort of black-eyed pea fritter popular in West Africa and known as &quot;Akara&quot; (along with other African names) is called &quot;Blistering Bean Balls&quot; in this book, with no mention the dish's African names.  Also, &quot;Poulet Yassa&quot; (made by grilling chicken that has been marinated in an onion-lemon mixture) is sometimes made with hot peppers, but is just as likely to be flavored mostly by the onions and lemon with little or no hot pepper.  Not all African cuisine is spicy-hot after all.<br />Finally, the &quot;Zanzibar Duck&quot; recipe seems to have been copied almost word for word from Laurens van der Post's &quot;Recipes: African Cooking (Foods of the World)&quot; (New York: Time-Life Books; 1970), but with no acknowledgement.<br />Overall, a good book for adventurous cook who likes it hot.	2002-03-07

AD, died 1378?) probably traveled overland more than any person in history before the invention of motor vehicles. His \\"Rihlah\\" (\\"Travels\\") is the monumental achievement in travel writing, made all the more amazing by the fact that he accomplished his travels almost 700 years ago. <br />Beginning with a trip circa 1325 for the Islamic haj (visit to Mecca), he spent nearly thirty years traveling and working in almost every Islamic civilization in existence (he also traveled in many non-Islamic countries): North Africa, Syria, Mecca, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Persia, Asia Minor, the Swahili coast, Samarkand, India (where he worked for seven years at the court of the Delhi Sultan), then China, the Maldives, the Malabar coast, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and Sumatra, then after his return home, he visited Spain, Morocco, Timbuktu and the Niger River area. <br />After his final return home, the ruler of Tangier, Ibn Juzayy, commanded him to write (by dictation) the account of his travels. He was able to recall from memory events of the previous three decades -- very impressive considering his detailed descriptions of the people, places, customs and traditions he came into contact with.<br />To this day, Battuta is still considered a generally reliable source for the geography of the 1300's. Historians and geographers have checked out his account of his travels and have found it amazingly accurate. Battuta is truly a window to the past, giving modern readers a look at the social, cultural, and political history of medieval civilization.<br />\\"The Travels of Ibn Battuta, A.D. 1325-1354\\", translated, revised, and notated by H.A.R. Gibb contains:<br />Vol. I: <BR>Ibn Juzayy's introduction <BR>1. North-West Africa and Egypt <BR>2. Syria <BR>3. From Damascus to Mecca <BR>4. Mecca <BR>5. From Mecca to Kufa <br />Vol. II: <BR>6.

Gibb (Profesor at Oxford and Harvard, author of many distinguished books on Arab and Islamic subjects) has done an excellent job: the introductions, notes, and appendixes are excellent. Well worth reading for anyone interested in the any of the areas Battuta covered, or for anyone with an interest in travel or history in general.	2002-03-05

This stretch of the Congo river was probably first written about in &quot;Through the Dark Continent&quot; by Henry Morton Stanley, who, in the employ of the King of Belgium, laid the foundation of the Congo Free State which inspired Conrad to write &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and the disintegration and aftermath of which became the subject of V. S. Naipaul's &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; and Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;.<br />Now, Jeffrey Tayler in &quot;Facing the Congo&quot; tells the story of his attempt to recreate Stanley's voyage down the Congo river.  He begins as did Winternitz, taking a barge up the river in the mid 1990s.  As there are virtually no roads in the Congo region these river barges are the only transportation available to the average Congolese.  They function as floating villages, filled with merchants who trade manufactured goods for forest products along the river route.  As if that isn't enough for a book, Tayler then buys a pirogue (canoe), hires a guide, and attempts to paddle back down to where he started.  <br />&quot;Facing the Congo&quot; is an excellent record of his trip.  He is a thoughtful and thought-provoking writer and as is the case with most good travel writing the book is not only a record of his voyage, but also a record of self-discovery.  Especially interesting are his interactions with the Congolese people he encounters along the way: people who usually can't fathom why a foreigner would be travelling the way he is.  Other writers might simply depict such encounters in a comical or stereotypical fashion; Tayler makes an honest attempt to see their world through their eyes.  He even manages some sympathy for the military and secret police officials that block his path.  A good choice for any armchair traveler or anyone interested in Central Africa.	2002-02-25

This book is a step in the right direction.  <br />If you enjoy both traditional recipes, and learning about the people and places that developed the traditions, then this book is for you.  &quot;Africa's Gifts to New World Cooking: Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons&quot; contains about 180 recipes from over a dozen countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Americas, all of them pieces in the culinary puzzle of the African diaspora.  <br />The recipes are categorized as &quot;Appetizers&quot;; &quot;Soups&quot;; &quot;Sauces and Condiments&quot;; &quot;Vegetables and Salads&quot;; &quot;Starches&quot;; &quot;Main Dishes&quot;; &quot;Desserts and Candies&quot;; and &quot;Beverages&quot;.  Each category contains a mix of African and African-influenced New World recipes, for example, in the &quot;Main Dishes&quot; section we find &quot;Chicken Pelau&quot; (from Trinidad and Tabago), then &quot;Moqueca de Peixe&quot; (Brazil), then &quot;Caldou&quot; (The Gambia), and &quot;Roast Chicken&quot; (United States).  Each recipe is introduced by a short paragraph about its history or the author's thoughts.<br />In addition to the recipes, the book contains an informative introduction, and a glossary of ingredients and utensils.  There is also an index. This book is a worthwhile addition to any cookbook shelf, as is the author's book of African recipes &quot;The Africa Cookbook: Tastes of a Continent&quot;.	2002-01-30

Winternitz and her companion traveled by river barge along the entire navigable portion of the Congo river, from Kinshasa to Kisangani. The Congo river barges are legendary among 'extreme' travelers. The end of Belgian colonization of the Congo meant the end of roads, making the river the only practical way to travel between Kinshasa and Kisangani. These river barges are (were?) floating villages, complete with markets and nightclubs populated by traders who make their livelihood onboard, as well as travelers going from place to place. From Kisangani the journey continues overland, to an eventual return to Kinshasa by air. In Kinshasa the pair are arrested and interrogated by the secret police after interviewing a politician opposed to president Moubutu. Winternitz gives an even-handed and interesting account of the journey, along with relevant history and background information. The book contains a good bibliography. This book was journalism when it was first published, and it is still worth reading today, as a document of the Congo under Moubutu.	2002-01-30

Of course, he runs into border guards and various officials, who eventually become fodder for his &quot;wit&quot;.  This account of his &quot;adventure&quot;, even though it may be completely true, leaves much to be desired: the author is annoyingly whiny and both an egoist and egotist.  He goes for laughs, not much else, and only partially suceeds.<br />Somehow this book reminds me of Abbott and Costello's &quot;Africa Screams&quot; -- everything about Africa in &quot;Malaria Dreams&quot; is told in a ridiculous and exaggerated manner.  The key difference is that we know that Abbott and Costello are comedians (and their movie is a half century old), while &quot;Malaria Dreams&quot; wants to be accorded the respect due to a non-fiction book.      <br />This is one of the poorer examples of the every-foreigner-who-goes-to-Africa-thinks-he-should-write-a-book phenomenon.  Better examples of this genre are: <br />&quot;The Ponds of Kalambayi&quot; by Mike Tidwell; <br />&quot;French Lessons in Africa: Travels With My Briefcase in French Africa&quot; by Peter Biddlecombe; and<BR>  <BR>&quot;Native Stranger: A Black American's Journey into the Heart of Africa&quot; by Eddy L.

The framework of the book is the author's report from a scientific conference held by the World Conference on Mummy Studies. Pringle introduces not only the latest scientific research into mummies, but the scientists themselves who have devoted their lives to studying the &quot;everlasting dead&quot;. She also introduces some of the ethical problems of mummy research: to autopsy or not to autopsy, to display or not to display. <br />This book is not just about Egyptian mummies. Despite the fact that the word &quot;mummy&quot; comes from Arabic and was first applied to the Egyptian practice, there are mummies all over the world. The oldest mummies are found in South America. For the World Conference on Mummy Studies, any preserved human dead is worthy of attention: bog bodies from Europe, frozen bodies in the world's highest mountains, preserved Communist dictators, and even future mummies preserved by cryonics. Pringle also looks into the recent history of ancient mummies: collector-mania and using mummies for medicine and paint (!).<br />If you think you would never want to read a book about mummies, this is the book for you. Informative, interesting, and very well-written, &quot;The Mummy Congress&quot; is destined to become a classic.	2001-11-10

It is a fascinating introduction to the idea of African-American diffusionism.  Van Sertima casts a very wide net, cataloging the possibility of voyages to the Americas by Phoenicians and Egyptians in ancient times, and West Africans in the centuries before Columbus.<br />The evidence (similarity of American and Egyptian pyramids, European encounters with dark-skinned people in the Americas before trans-Atlantic slavery, Native American and West African folktales and oral history, New World crops in the Old World and vice-versa prior to 1492, linguistic similarities between West Africans and Native Americans, ancient American statues with Negroid features, Columbus's contact with African sailors, etc.) presented in this book is continually interesting, and is enough to convince someone who wants to believe it, but it is never quite conclusive enough to convince a skeptic.<br />At some points, the book is not as well organized as one would wish, and it sometimes jumps from topic to topic without adequate transition and introduction.  Also, I did not care for the way some of the information was presented in historical novel form.  But overall, there is much food for thought here.  Thor Heyerdahl has proved that ancient peoples had the technology to cross vast oceans; there is absolutely no reason why Africans couldn't have sailed to the Americas (especially since the Gulf Stream makes it possible to get between Africa and America almost without trying).  Whether they did so by accident or design, and when and how often, are questions historians and archeologists still have to answer.  Much more work is needed in this area.  Given that this book was first published in 1976, one can hope that another substantial work in this area may come soon.	2001-11-01

Hess has provided an informative introduction to the recipes (which are reproduced in their entirety), explaining many 19th century cooking concepts which may be unfamiliar to the modern cook and providing as much of Abby Fisher's story as can be found.  In Fisher's original text it is interesting to see some of the earliest known written recipes for several dishes and to discover others which are almost unknown today.  Fisher's original recipes are typical of 19th century (and earlier) cookbooks.  Each recipe is several sentences in a single paragraph, with no separate ingredient list.  In many cases it is assumed that the cook will know how to prepare something that is taken as a given in the recipe.  This is a cookbook from a time when all cooking was &quot;from scratch&quot;, when there were few labor-saving kitchen gadgets, and printed books were luxury items.  It is not a step-by-step cookbook.  [For that, see Chef Paul Prudhomme or Southern Living.]<br />&quot;Good Things to Eat&quot; by Rufus Estes is sometimes called the first cookbook written by an African-American.  &quot;What Mrs. Fisher Knows&quot; was published thirty years earlier.  (It could be said that Mrs. Fisher, a former slave, did not actually &quot;write&quot; the book as she evidently did not know how to write; she dictated the recipes to a member of the Women's Cooperative Printing Office in San Francisco which published the work in 1881.)<br />(The editor, Karen Hess has done similar work on Mary Randolph's &quot;The Virginia Housewife&quot; and &quot;Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery and Booke of Sweetmeats&quot;.)	2001-10-26

Nothing escapes Burton's observation. He writes of everything from the local hairstyles to the price of pombe (African beer). He gives detailed descriptions of the landscape, geography, flora, and fauna. He writes of Arabs and the Eastern slave trade. He depicts safari life in the days of human porters and mules. He tells of the people he encounters, though his descriptions of Africans may be offensive to some. There is a wealth of information here, something for everyone with an interest in Eastern Africa, or exploration, or imperialism. The place names have sometimes changed from Burton's time to ours, as have the English spelling conventions of Swahili words. Anyone with any interest in Eastern Africa, especially the precolonial period, should arm themselves with a good atlas and reference book and read Burton. <br />Burton led an amazing life of exploration and scholarship [he wrote &quot;The Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah&quot; after disguising himself as an Arab to travel to the sacred city; he visited Salt Lake City and wrote &quot;City of the Saints&quot;; after exploring in South America he wrote &quot;Explorations of the Highlands of Brazil&quot;; and he translated the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and poetry of Luís de Camões], still he may not be an easy writer to come to terms with for many contemporary readers. He is far from what we would call &quot;politically correct&quot;. But he wrote so much and so well, and is practically the only writer to travel in Eastern Africa in the 1850's that is in print today (except for John Hanning Speke who was with him on this trip, and who wrote &quot;Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile&quot;). <br />To put this book in context it is wise to read something about Burton, particulary Burton and Speke in Africa; know why in &quot;Lake Regions&quot; Burton never refers to Speke by name. (There are a few Burton biographies, and books about Burton and Speke; or see the movie: &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot;)	2001-10-20

Still it is an important and outstanding book.  Reader is a good writer and his research and grasp of a myriad of disciplines related to his subject is impressive.<br />The story is told by geography:  Savanna, Desert, Rain Forest, Mountains, Sahel, Great Lakes, Coast, Southern Africa.  Being a &quot;companion&quot; to the PBS/NGS TV series there is some (but not much) focus on the people who appeared in the television documentaries.  Mostly Reader tells the stories behind the story; his history of Africa is as much about the environmental, geographical, and physiological as merely chronological.  For example, Reader tells why bananas and plantains are so important in African history; what makes camels so invaluable in the Sahara, how sickle cells and malaria are related, even the advantages and disadvantages of walking upright.  Of course there is some in-this-year-such-and-such happened, but that is kept to a minimum.  This &quot;Africa&quot; is not only an outstanding introduction to Africa, it should also be of interest to any Africanist.  <br />The photographs by Michael Lewis are good enough to be a book of their own; they combine with Reader's well organized and informative text to make &quot;Africa&quot; an excellent portrait of the continent.  Reader's &quot;Biography of the Continent&quot; is also highly recommended.	2001-09-30

The book covers the basic anthropology subjects: courtship and marriage, family, politics, land tenure, home ownership, and so on.  The Swahili culture is complex and somewhat difficult to define; there has never really been a Swahili nation-state, and many of the people who live in Swahili cities are not recognized as Swahili.  Middleton writes from his own long experience of East Africa (he is the author of several books) as well as bibliographic research.

Now it has aged into an historical novel. The largest part of the novel concerns two men, once childhood friends: Kimani, a Kenyan Kikuyu, and Peter, a British settler. They grow up together on a farm in the &quot;white highlands&quot;, Kimani is the son of a farmhand, Peter the son of the owner. They imagine themselves working together as adults, as gunbearer and white hunter, guiding tourists on hunting safaris. Instead they become adversaries during the Mau Mau. Ruark tells a good story though the book is a bit long in places. Throughout the novel, the depictions of both African and British characters is remarkably balanced and fair. Ruark is one of the few white writers of the 1950s to provide a sympathetic and (apparently) informed view of African (particularly Kikuyu) culture. It is the clash of Kikuyu and British cultures, as British law is applied to traditional Kikuyu custom that is the impetus for Kimani to join the rebellion. It would be interesting to know if all of the novel's details of the Mau Mau oaths are accurate. The female characters are a bit one dimensional; this is a book about hunting, warfare, and the world as seen by men. Overall, a very good book, especially for anyone interested in Kenya and the end of colonialism.

Burton is a well-titled book.  It describes Burton's exploration at a time when a good part of the East African mainland was more-or-less under the control of the Omani rulers of Zanzibar, after they had moved their capital from Oman, begun the cultivation of cloves, and achieved control of the East African slave trade.  Burton made the journey in 1857, however publication of the book was delayed until 1871 (he shares his ideas as to why).  Burton begins with a valuable review of &quot;How the Nile Question Stood in 1856&quot;, which summarizes the various theories about the source of the Nile at that time, a question which he and his colleague John Hanning Speke played large parts in solving.  The book continues in typical Burton fashion:  observations on Zanzibar city, its fauna and flora, industry (&quot;closely akin to nil&quot;), government, rulers, foreign residents, and the ethnology of the &quot;Arabs&quot; and &quot;Wasawahili and Slave Races&quot;.  Continuing on the East African mainland (present Kenya and mainland Tanzania) he covers the city of &quot;Mombasah&quot;, as well as the geography and ethnology of the interior.  Much has changed since Burton's time, especially the spellings of places and peoples.  The book closes with a touching biographical chapter about the aforementioned John Hanning Speke.  Appendixes cover &quot;Commercial Matters at Zanzibar&quot; (exports, imports, prices); &quot;Thermometric Observations in East Africa&quot;; &quot;Meteorological Observations&quot;; etc.  This is a very good book for those interested in first-hand accounts of exploration or East African history, but it is not an introduction to the subject.	2001-08-02

Those who know Mary Kingsley probably never thought there would be a children's book about her, but why not?  Her classic \\"Travels in West Africa\\" is still in print after over 100 years, and deservedly so (please see my review).  This is a fine book for children, especially because its true-life Victorian heroine did something that most modern people wouldn't do, i.e., she traveled, on her own, though mostly unexplored Africa (Gabon to be precise), and afterwards became a very popular writer and speaker.  Hopefully children who read this will someday go on to read Kingsley in her own words.  [One small note: terminology has changed a bit, by \\"West Africa\\" Kingsley refers to what we would today call the Atlantic coast region of Central Africa.]	2001-07-30

It is basically a mystery, set among British Egyptologists and Egyptophiles in late 19th century Egypt.  The novel's Egyptian background (both ancient and 19th century) is (as far as I can tell) all historically correct; evidently this continues through the entire series of Amelia Peabody mysteries, each with its own susequent historical setting.  The story is romantic, but with its female heroine it is at times a gentle parody of the typical romance novels.  Add the facts that it is witty, literate, well-written, and populated with vibrant characters and this book is easy to recommend highly.  I am certain I will read more of Elizabeth Peters [who is actually a pseudonym of Barbara Mertz, who is an author of nonfiction Egyptology books, and is also Barbara Michaels, a pseudonym she uses to author gothic suspense novels].	2001-07-26

In this book Dr. Close shares many unique and moving stories from his medical practice in New York, Congo/Zaire, and Wyoming. His stories from his time in Africa are especially interesting to me. In the pre-independence Belgian Congo he worked first as a hospital surgeon in Kinshasa, then in independent Zaire, as President Mobutu's personal physician. From his perspective as a physician he sees the end of colonialism in central Africa, and the beginning of the chaos of independent Zaire. One very touching story is that of his domestic security guard, an elderly veteran of WWII, whose wish is for a doctor to see his dying wife, just so he can tell his grandchildren that she was seen by a doctor before she died. The chapters about Mobutu depict a man very different than is typically seen in print; apparently even dictators have their good side. This book is recommended to anyone who is interested in medicine or Africa. [Note: most of this book is the same as the out-of-print &quot;A Doctor's Story&quot;; the newer version has two new chapters and photographs.]	2001-07-25

The recipes are modernized and streamlined for cooks in the developed world (e.g., canned and frozen foods are used in place of less processed counterparts, more common ingredients are often substituted for rarer ones); this may be a good thing or not depending on what you're looking for.  The book is aimed at students and has a class-project feel to it.  While there is much to admire here, I found several things that concern me.  Consider the following from the &quot;Africa&quot; section of the book:<br />1) A recipe from Tanzania with the Swahili title &quot;Ndizi na Nyama&quot; is called &quot;Stewed Tomatoes with Bananas&quot;. &quot;Ndizi&quot; means &quot;Banana&quot; (or &quot;Plantain&quot;), &quot;na&quot; means &quot;and&quot;, and &quot;Nyama&quot; means &quot;Meat&quot;, but there is no meat in the recipe.  Maybe the recipe is &quot;Ndizi na Nyanya&quot; (i.e., &quot;Bananas and Tomatoes&quot;).<br />2) A recipe from Gabon for &quot;Gâteau&quot; is a recipe for French bread.  &quot;Gâteau&quot; is the French word for &quot;cake&quot;, and &quot;pain&quot; is the French word for &quot;bread&quot;.  The text explains that people in Cameroon and Gabon use the word &quot;gâteau&quot; (instead of &quot;pain&quot;) to refer to bread.  I lived in Gabon for two years and will be the first to admit that the French language as spoken in Africa often differs from that in France, but I never met anyone who called bread anything other than &quot;pain&quot;.  Perhaps things are different in Cameroon.  (Interestingly, the Gabonese almost always did use the word &quot;gâteau&quot; to refer what the rest of the French-speakingworld call &quot;beignets&quot;, that is, &quot;doughnuts&quot;.)<br />3) Why does a recipe in the &quot;Egypt&quot; section for &quot;Egyptian-Style Eggplant Salad&quot; have the title &quot;Auberginen auf Ägyptische Art&quot; (which is German for &quot;Eggplant in the Egyptian Style&quot;)?  I don't get it.<br />4) Why call the &quot;stiff cornmeal porridge&quot;, which is eaten all over Sub-Saharan Africa, by its Lesotho name &quot;Putu&quot; even when it appears in dishes from other countries where it is called by other names?  The more common Eastern African name, &quot;Ugali&quot;, is never mentioned. <br />These may seem very small matters, and they don't affect the quality of the recipes, but they make this reviewer begin to wonder about the rest of the book, especially unfamiliar recipes.  Despite the fact that most of the recipes and related texts seem correct (as far as I can tell), until this book gets a complete going-over by a team of fact checkers, I cannot recommend it.	2001-06-25

Look first to the work of Harold Courlander.  He is one of the finest folktale anthropologists of his generation. &quot;The Cow-Tail Switch and Other West African Stories&quot; is one several of his books which are of interest to Africanists.  (He also authored several similar books of folktales and traditional literature from other parts of the world.)  In 1947 when &quot;The Cow-Tail Switch and Other West African Stories&quot; was first published, there were far fewer books of this kind than there are today.  Two things that make Courlander's work stand out, even now, are: 1) his well written prose, and 2) the notes, which give the reader more information about the story, where it came from, and how to understand it in the context of the culture that produced it.  This second point is especially important today, when a lot of books of so-called &quot;African&quot; stories are published without any background information at all.  This collection of stories, all from Western Africa, is great for kids and adults.  (Harold Courlander is also the author of &quot;The African&quot;, which bears many similarities to &quot;Roots&quot; by Alex Haley, though Haley's book was published years later.)	2001-06-12

Winternitz and her companion traveled by river barge along the entire navigable portion of the Congo river, from Kinshasa to Kisangani.  The Congo river barges are legendary among 'extreme' travelers.  The end of Belgian colonization of the Congo meant the end of roads, making the river the only practical way to travel between Kinshasa and Kisangani.  These river barges are (were?) floating villages, complete with markets and nightclubs populated by traders who make their livelihood onboard, as well as travelers going from place to place.  From Kisangani the journey continues overland, to an eventual return to Kinshasa by air.  In Kinshasa the pair are arrested and interrogated by the secret police after interviewing a politician opposed to president Moubutu. Winternitz gives an even-handed and interesting account of the journey, along with relevant history and background information.  The book contains a good bibliography.  This book was journalism when it was first published, and it is still worth reading today, as a document of the Congo under Moubutu.	2001-06-11
US	52879248	RWVUHPUGJ0YYS	0060956399	723179563	The White Nile	Books	5	54	58	N	N	Magnificent Must Read	Alan Moorehead is one of the finest writers of history books for the lay reader, and &quot;The White Nile&quot; is one of his best books. Moorehead focuses on the period of 1856-1899, telling the story of European discovery, conquest, and colonization of the Nile region. The first part, &quot;Exploration&quot;, covers Burton, Speke, Baker, Mutesa, Livingstone, and Stanley. The second part, &quot;Exploitation&quot;, covers growing European influence in Khedive Ismail's Egypt and Barghash's Zanzibar in the 1860's, and introduces General Gordon. The third part, &quot;The Moslem Revolt&quot; sees General Gordon defeated by the Mahdi at Khartoum and Emin Pasha rescued by Stanley. The last part, &quot;The Christian Victory&quot; tells of Marchand's march to Fashoda, Kitchener's victory in Khartoum, and the arrival of Thomas Cook cruises. Some may object to Moorehead's emphasis on Europeans, but this is part of the history of the region. It is fascinating history and it is brought to life in this book, which has deservedly become a classic. Well worth reading not only for the history itself, but also for Moorehead's well-crafted prose. Five stars.	2001-06-02

Her story is remarkable. In the 1890s, unmarried and no longer having to care for her parents, Kingsley decides she should travel in &quot;the tropics&quot; and sets off for &quot;West Africa&quot; (i.e., the West coast of Central Africa). She travels as a scientist, collecting fish specimens, and finances her travels by trading along the way--but mostly she travels for the love of adventure and to satisfy an appetite for the unknown.<br />Kingsley's book is a treasure trove of information about Atlantic-coast Central Africa in the late 1800s. But beyond its historic and sociological value, the book is just wonderful. Her descriptions are vivid, her insights interesting, and her understated humor is a joy. Anyone with a love of exploration and a good story would enjoy this book.  Unabridged versions are highly recommended.<br />Readers with a particular interest in Gabon should also see the works of Robert Nassau, an American missionary who was in Gabon when Kingsley traveled there. Evidently they met and discussed all things African at length, though Kingsley makes little mention of him. Nassau wrote &quot;Fetichism in West Africa&quot;, &quot;In an Elephant Corral&quot; and &quot;My Ogowe&quot;, but doesn't get the credit he deserves. Also of interest is &quot;One Dry Season: In the Footsteps of Mary Kingsley&quot; by Caroline Alexander. Alexander visited Gabon in the 1980s and compared what she saw then to what Kingsley had seen a century earlier.	2001-04-29

Most have never heard of the bonobo, the forgotten  ape.  No wonder.  The bonobo was one of the last large mammals to be scientifically classified. Long confused with chimpanzees, it was declared a distinct species only in the 1930s.  There are very few bonobos in the wild, and far fewer in zoos.  But bonobos are, as is made very clear in this book, very different from chimpanzees, especially in their family and social structures and, to be most frank about it, their sexual habits.  I will leave more detail to the author, world-renowned primatologist Frans de Waal.  This is a very interesting and well written book, with much to say about apes, and much food for thought about our own species.  It includes many excellent photographs by Frans Lanting.	2001-04-26

It is that, but it is well done.  Maier's book is mostly anecdotal stories of individual Africans, circa the 1990s: a stone-sculptor in Zimbabwe, a medical researcher in Mali, an elderly woman in Ghana, the &quot;only honest man&quot; in Nigeria, all of them doing their best in a changing world.  His tone is respectful and basically positive and optimistic, but without being romantic or glossing over the continent's well-documented problems.  Like many books about Africa, some of &quot;Into the House of the Ancestors&quot; is devoted the author's theory of why things in Africa are so bad: Maier says the problem is colonialism's replacement of the traditional and indigenous with the modern and foreign.  For things to change, the solutions to Africa's problems must come from Africa.  Maier believes that in the 1990s Africa began a second revolution that will lead to better things.  One can hope.  Whether the future proves Maier right or not, these stories are compelling non-fiction reading.	2001-04-05

The protagonist is Meka, a village elder, who has always been a good colonial subject.  When he is summoned to receive a medal at a ceremonial presentation, his ideas begin to change.  Meka, his wife, and other villagers are well-drawn characters.  The English translation reads very well, and preserves the elegant vocabulary and sentence structure of the original French.  The novel is an indictment of colonialism, but with a subtle and often humorous approach.  &quot;The Old Man and the Medal&quot; was among the first African novels I encountered, but it is also a book that I have enjoyed re-reading as I have learned more about Africa.	2001-03-23

Salt mining in this part of Africa is an important part of history and lore; salt has been carried to market by camel caravan for centuries, and it was at times so rare that it was reportedly worth its weight in gold.  Trench's journey required a carefully planned overland trip on camelback.  Trench lived and traveled with nomads through the Sahara to Taoudenni then on to Timbuktu.  His account of the journey -- his relationship with his guides, the difficulties of desert travel, encounters with government officials -- is very good reading.  &quot;Forbidden Sands&quot; also contains the fruits of his research into the historical record of the region. (Ibn Battuta and Rene Caillie, for example.)  A great book for armchair travelers or readers interested in the Eastern Sahara and Mali.	2001-03-16

In Mali, some distance from Timbuktu, he finds a desolate, nearly dead village which was once an important waystation on trans-Saharan caravan routes.  He has an epiphany. He decides to teach the villagers how to raise vegetables in a garden.  With his own money and resources he starts the garden.  One thing leads to another, and he decides to stay longer than he had planned.  Overcoming numerous obstacles he eventually starts a school and a hotel (which he calls the Hilton, in hopes that the real Hilton hotel corporation will sue, thereby publicizing his project).  Life in the village changes: an entrepreneurial class begins to emerge from a medieval master-serf society.  He comes to love the village and its people.  He tells his story in &quot;Seasons of Sand&quot;.  It is not a great book per se, but Aebi's story is worth hearing, and he shares much of his first-hand knowledge of Saharan peoples and traditions.  He is a down-to-earth and practical man, and he writes without pretension.  The story ends circa the early 1990's.  What has become of Aebi and the people he single-handedly helped?  The rest of the story should be part of a new edition of this book.  This book deserves at least some of the recognition that &quot;I Dreamed of Africa&quot; has received.	2001-02-16

This book focuses mostly on Africa in the 20th century, which, for most of the continent saw the last decades of colonialism and first decades of independence. Davidson draws on lessons learned over a lifetime to describe the nation-state both in Africa and Europe (a surprising amount of the book describes the advent of the European nation-state). He also describes many personal experiences from decades spent studying Africa. This is one of many fine books by one of the 20th century's best historians.	2001-02-06

It is told in the first-person by a girl, daughter of missionary parents, growing up in the Belgian Congo, circa 1960.  The stories are focused on the narrator and her memories of her parents and the local people (Congolese and ex-pats) in and near missionary communities.  Issues the seven-year narrator deals with include the mix of American Protestant and African traditional beliefs she encounters; the meaning of the equator and scientific reality; and White racism towards the Congolese.

The descriptions of Botswana and its people (especially the female American doctoral student who is the narrator, the internationally famous economic development expert she falls in love with, and other members of the ex-pat community in Africa) are three-dimensional and well-drawn.  Most reviewers of &quot;Mating&quot; mention its erudition and intellectual qualities.  My problem is that there's just too much of it.  I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had been about a hundred pages shorter; as it is, I ran out of interest about two/thirds before the end.  I can recommend it mostly to readers who like long books full of long words.  Another story of ex-pat love in Africa is told in &quot;Rules of the Wild&quot; by Francesca Marciano.	2001-01-22

Brokken is a Dutch travel writer and novelist (sort of a Dutch Paul Theroux).  He took a trip to Gabon in the 1990's and writes about his experiences, but what's really impressive is his knowledge and presentation of Gabonese history and the historical literature written by people like mystery writer Georges Simenon; explorers like Paul du Chaillu, Count Brazza, Henry Morton Stanley, and Mary Kingsley; physician philosopher Albert Schweitzer; and Gabonese historian Andre Raponda-Walker.  Brokken tells the stories of the Gabonese kings and peoples; the conflicts between the coastal and the inland populations; and the 19th century migrations of the Fang (including some interesting ideas on that central African bugaboo, cannibalism).  I was a Peace Corps volunteer there.  This is probably the most interesting and best written book about Gabon that I have read.  Even if you've never been to Gabon, or even Africa, this is a very good and informative mix of travel essay and history.  Well worth reading.  I very much hope Brokken's other books about Africa will be translated into English.	2001-01-09

This book is an interesting and very readable documentation of Kenya in the era of Isak Dinesen, Bror Blixen, Denys Finch Hatton, et al (all of whom she knew). Hemingway praised this book lavishly, saying: <br />\\"Did you read Beryl Markham's book, \\"West with the Night\\"? I knew her fairly well in Africa and never would have suspected that she could and would put pen to paper except to write in her flyer's log book. As it is, she has written so well, and marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a writer. .... But this girl who is, to my knowledge, very unpleasant,... can write rings around all of us who consider ourselves as writers. The only parts of it that I know about personally, on account of having been there at the time and heard the other people's stories, are absolutely true. So, you have to take as truth the early stuff about when she was a child which is absolutely superb. She omits some very fantastic stuff which I know about which would destroy much of the character of the heroine; but what is that anyhow in writing?\\" <br />As Hemingway may have suspected, Markham may not be the real author, and \\"West With the Night\\" does leave out major portions of her life; it would be a good idea to read it along with the biography of her life, \\"Straight On Till Morning: The Biography of Beryl Markham\\" by Mary Lovell (Lovell also wrote \\"A Rage to Live: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton\\").	2000-12-29

It is a pleasantly nostalgic memoir of a childhood spent in the town of Kouroussa (French Guinea, now Guinea) and the village of Tindican, his mother's birthplace.  Chapter by chapter Camara recounts his childhood memories: his father's work as a goldsmith and his position in society, his parent's magic, village life, the rice harvest, elementary Koranic education, circumcision and young men's secret society, secondary education in Conakry, girls and courtship, and his departure to continue his studies in France.  After almost half a century in print, this deserves to be called a classic.  [Note: some authorities state that his family name is Camara (also spelled Kamara) and his given name is Laye; the text supports this at one point.  If using search engines to look for information on this author it may be useful to try both versions of his name.]	2000-11-30

At the same time, cookbook writers and other gastronomic experts state that Africans had no culinary traditions or cuisine of their own; they learned it all from contact with Europeans. There is a contradiction here. It is this book's goal to document African cuisine and especially to demonstrate the unacknowledged and unappreciated African influence on culinary traditions outside of Africa.<br />Of course, \\"The Peppers, Cracklings, and Knots of Wool Cookbook\\" has chapters on African influences in the cuisine of the Southern U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil. It should be obvious that the food traditions that came to the Americas with enslaved Africans had a significant effect. (Should be obvious, though is still unacknowledged and unappreciated.) <br />What is surprising and a bit controversial is Spivey's hypothesis of African influences in ancient times in the Americas and Asia. Spivey takes it as a given that Africans sailed to and traded with the Americas in ancient and medieval times. The real extent of this contact (if any) and its effects on cuisine may be lost to history. At this time, most scholars are unconvinced -- however, this could change with time.  The question remains:  When there are similarities in the cuisine Mesoamerican people and West African people, is it may be due to specific historical contact between the two? or it could also be a case of two separate cultures making the best possible food in similar environments with similar gastronomic possibilities?  Spivey clearly prefers the former and ignores the later.  There is the need for more research here; this book is just getting the ball rolling. (The possibility of Old World peoples visiting the Americas before Columbus is well presented in \\"The Diffusionists Have Landed\\" in \\"The Atlantic Monthly\\" magazine; January 2000.)<br />Spivey's book is also part cookbook, and the recipes are excellent. It should be mentioned that these recipes are more based-on-tradition than actually traditional. In some cases it seems that Spivey invents recipes based on the theory of historical contact between African and non-African cultures. For example, \\"Chocolate Lamb and Beef Sauce\\" which combines the African peanut-stew and the Mexican molé sauce traditions. Does Spivey believe that ancient Africans made this after their voyages to America? Is there any historical text that mentions such a dish?  Or did this recipe come into being with her book? Either way, it sounds delicious.	2000-10-17

It came out of Hemingway's 1953 Kenyan safari (two decades after the trip that resulted in &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;) and tells the story of the narrator's hunting and game warden adventures, his affair with an African woman, and his wife's pursuit of a lion.  The safari party is vividly portrayed and the local Africans are documented with respect and understanding.  Hunting and the African flora and fauna are well described, as the British colonial administration and the ensuing Mau-Mau comprise the background.  As usual, Hemingway shares his philosophy of life, love, art, and death, and shows himself well versed on things African and literature related to Africa.  Son Patrick Hemingway, who was there in 1953 and who worked in Kenya as one of the last generation of white hunters, did an excellent editing job, forging the book from the original manuscript and providing a very useful introduction, cast of characters, and Swahili glossary.  This is highly recommended for any Hemingway fans and anyone interested in Africa.	2000-10-12

It takes patience and effort to read this book, but for some readers it will be well worth it.  <br />It is hard not to give an equivocal review of &quot;The Famished Road&quot;.  I would have liked it more if I had read it some years ago when I was more into writers like Thomas Pynchon, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, or Salman Rushdie.  Comparing Okri to those writers should give you an idea of what this book is like: long, complicated, often surreal (the term &quot;magical realism&quot; is used in discussions of this book), and sometimes confusing.  Okri weaves many elements of traditional Nigerian folklore into his novel, but the form and structure are very much in the tradition of the modern English novel.  I can't get help but feel that this book seems to be written for an audience of professors, grad-students, and people who are very serious about the novel as an art form.  Those aren't necessarily bad things, indeed for many readers those are the best qualities a book can have.  I wonder if many Nigerians have read this book, and if not, if a book popular in Nigeria might be more interesting and informative than &quot;The Famished Road&quot;.  But that's the thing: being interested in the novel as an art form is not the same as wanting to read a book to learn something about Nigeria.  <br />Another Nigerian writer whose works are often based on African folklore is Amos Tutuola.	2000-09-28

People who have spent some time in Africa with Africans or have studied Africa seriously are more reserved in their praise. Nothing about Africa in this book is incorrect (as far as I can tell), there's just not much of it.	2000-09-27

This is a  very fine introduction to and overview of Sub-Saharan Africa. Lamb mixes  first-hand reporting with an effective presentation of Africa's colonial  and independence-era past.  The entire book is well written, packed with  information, and well worth the time it takes to read its 300-some pages.   The original edition was published in 1983, before the AIDS crisis and  Nelson Mandela's transformation from prisoner to president, and this is one  small problem: what is written in the present tense in the book is nearly  as historical as what is presented as prior history; its a bit difficult to  keep straight when the various notes and epilogue were written.  A quick  look at a few websites (like the CIA World Factbook) should provide the  most recent information.  This sort of thing is sure to be a problem with  any book that covers recent history.  Nevertheless, this book's strengths  far outweigh this small weakness.  This is an outstanding and very fair  look at Africa's cultures, history, politics, societies, and  traditions.<br />Lamb's book starts with an overview of African politics circa  the early 1980's and a chapter about the difference between traditional and  modern Africa.  The next chapter covers some of Africa's &quot;big  men&quot; bad and good: Mobutu, Bokassa, Moi, Nyerere, et al.  Uganda's Idi  Amin gets an entire chapter, as does the OAU.  In the next chapter, African  coups are discussed.  Then the end of the colonial era, Portugal's African  colonies, and African relations with the U.S. and U.S.S.R. The contrasts  between the Ivory Coast (led by President Houphouet-Boigny) and Guinea (led  President Sekou Toure) make an interesting chapter.  Westerners' African  Culture Shock is the next chapter's subject, followed by a chapter about  journalism in Africa.  Health and sickness is treated next, then some sense  about African money and economies. Finally Nigeria and South Africa each  get a chapter.  <br />Anyone looking for a relatively short and easy to read  book about Africa would do well to read David Lamb's &quot;The  Africans&quot;.	2000-09-16

Many Westerners feel the need to write a book after traveling  or living in Africa, some actually do, but few  write a good book; here is  the exception: this is a very good book.  In the mid-1980s Tidwell worked  as a Peace Corps volunteer in the very center of Africa, rural then-Zaire  (later Congo or &quot;Congo-Kinshasa&quot;).  This published account of his  experience is thoughtful and honest and his prose writing and story-telling  skills are excellent.  He shares valuable insights into the daily lives,  culture, and history of the villagers whom he taught fish farming and lived  and worked with for two years.  As expected, Tidwell documents the joys,  sorrows, and travails of aquaculture, but that is only part of this book.  He also writes about his faithful household employee; drinking; sickness  and recovery, or death; hunting; poverty; marriage, family life, and  children; cotton farming; diamond mining; and a hundred other things.   Equally engaging and important is his description of the effects his  experience had on him, physically, mentally, and emotionally.  This book is  an excellent choice for anyone with an interest in the Peace Corps, Africa,  or Tilapia.	2000-09-05

It went a  long way in establishing Hemingway's reputation as a hunter and adventurer.   Though non-fiction it has the organization of a Hemingway novel and reads  much like his other works.  His descriptions of the landscape, local  people, other hunters, and especially animals, hunting, and killing are  superb.  Hemingway also shares, mostly as dialogue, his thoughts on life,  war, fate, and notably literature and the literary life.  His often-quoted  idea of all American literature being descended from one book by Mark Twain  is presented here, as are his thoughts on how America destroys its writers.   Some knowledge of Eastern Africa (such as a basic history, a guidebook, an  encyclopedia article) might be useful as Hemingway often does provide much  introductory material.  With &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; Hemingway  follows in the footsteps of Theodore Roosevelt's &quot;African Game  Trails&quot;; both did much to popularize among Americans the idea of  recreational travel in Africa.  Hemingway went on to write two fictional  stories set in Africa: &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; and &quot;The  Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot;.  A good book, moreso for fans  of Papa and those with an interest in Africa.	2000-09-05

It is an  annoying combination of hodge-podge and mish-mash that adds up to less than  the sum of its parts.  Not only does the book as a whole not hold together,  but too often the stories themselves are little more than strange  juxtapositions of unrelated thoughts, images, and events that leave the  confused reader with a response of &quot;Huh?&quot;.  The success of her  first book evidently convinced Gallmann that there is no end to her  readers' patience.  This book might make sense to her, as her own personal  journal, but for the rest of us it is elliptical and way too  self-indulgent.  There are a few interesting scenes, and we may learn a  thing or two about Africa and Africans, but there are far better books to  read.  (See my other reviews for starters, please.)  It would have been far  better to save the material in &quot;African Nights&quot; until, with the  help of a very good editor, a real book could have been made from it.	2000-08-26

The action takes place in and around Karen, but this isn't Blixen's Africa.   The novel's tone is on the ironic, cynical, and jaded side, but one  suspects there is a lot of truth here.  The privileged, self-obsessed,  always-outsider Wazungu are not easy to like, but they seem to be in  keeping with the apparently deserved reputation for decadence among the  ex-pat community in &quot;Happy Valley&quot;. (see: &quot;White  Mischief&quot; by James Fox).  As with most fiction (by white authors) set  in Africa, Africans play a small supporting role, but this is the only  novel I know of that asks, Why?  This is a romance set in Africa, but it's  a romance the way Clint Eastwood's &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; is a  western.  It takes the conventions and forces them through the ringer; the  characters themselves in &quot;Rules of the Wild&quot; react against the  (&quot;Out of) Africa(&quot;) that was (or never was).  Kenya's natural  wonders and human tragedies are well described, but the real story here,  also well written, is emotional as the narrator struggles to understand her  world and her self.  This isn't for everyone, but I suspect most people  under-40 will enjoy this novel.	2000-08-25

European and  American settlers in Eastern Africa, once friendly neighbors, reluctantly  turned to enemies.  World War I battles in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the  history of pre-WWI German colonization in Africa (more-or-less present day  Rwanda, Burundi, and mainland Tanzania, Cameroon, Togo, and Namibia), are  today mostly forgotten.  The background of the novel is the amazing success  of German lieutenant colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck (not much portrayed in  the story), who commanded Germany's tiny, undersupplied African force  (mostly African soldiers).  He inflicted embarrassing losses on British  forces at Tanga, and tied down Allied forces that outnumbered his own by at  least 10 to 1 for the duration of the war.  Against this fascinating and  little-known history, &quot;An Ice-Cream War&quot; is an engaging novel of  war, love, and revenge.  <br />Boyd's comedy of diplomacy in Africa &quot;A  Good Man in Africa&quot; is also recommended.	2000-08-20

Biddlecombe careens from business-class hotel and international conference  center to rural village and farm, and describes his encounters with  everything from white magic in Benin, locusts in Mali, to lost luggage in  Congo.  He shares his encounters with Africans of all sorts: government  minister, customs officer, doctor-entrepreneur, gold smuggler, chicken  farmer, soap manufacturer, and cassette pirater.  He shares his thoughts,  knowledge, and conversations covering African leaders, economic  development, the CFA franc, colonization and independence, health and  nutrition, literature, music, and architecture.

This handsome book is  a very fine biography for young readers; it includes many excerpts from  Sarah's letters and the Queen's diaries, as well as historic illustrations.   Relevant information about 19th century West Africa and Britain (e.g., the  Dahomey empire, the slave trade and British actions to end it, Christian  missions in Africa, Sierra Leone, the British class system, women's place  in society, etc.) is well presented.  Although Sarah's story is interesting  because of its uniqueness, much about the lives of ordinary 19th century  West Africans and Europeans can be learned here.  Despite the fact that  there is little material concerning Sarah's life, the author has done a  fine job and readers interested in Africa should be glad he did.  The book  contains a useful bibliography which includes &quot;Dahomey and the  Dahomans&quot; (1851) by Frederick E. Forbes (the captain who rescued and  adopted Sarah).<br />19th century Dahomey is also the setting of &quot;The  Viceroy of Ouidah&quot; by Bruce Chatwin.	2000-08-13

Beginning with a trip to Mecca for the Islamic pilgrimage, he  spent nearly three decades traveling and working in almost every Islamic  country in the Eastern Hemisphere (He also traveled in many non-Islamic  countries). His &quot;Rihlah&quot; (&quot;Travels&quot;) is the monumental  achievement in travel writing, made all the more amazing by the fact that  he accomplished his travels almost 700 years ago. Most of his writing  covers his travels outside of Africa (Arabia, Persia, India, and China).  However, his written accounts of his visits to the nascent Swahili  city-states on Africa's East Coast and the West African kingdom of Mali are  the only primary historical sources for these civilizations in medieval  times. Battuta is truly a window to the past, giving modern readers a look  at the social, cultural, and political history of medieval African Islamic  civilization.<br />&quot;Ibn Battuta in Black Africa&quot; is a well-edited  collection of Battuta's travels in Sub-Saharan Africa. The book is not a  lengthy one (it can be easily read in an evening), but it is full of useful  information in the introduction and notes on Battuta's text. This is a very  good introduction to Ibn Battuta for the student of African history.  <br />Also see &quot;The Travels of Ibn Battuta&quot; (three volumes) by Sir  Hamilton Gibb: an unabridged translation with excellent notes.	2000-08-09

The book is a combination of  personal essay, travelogue, and history.  Much of the criticism of the  &quot;Wonders of the African World&quot; TV/book production focused on  Gates' sometimes goofy (to the point of insulting, think some) behavior  vis-a-vis Africans; in print, Gates is more in his element and the book  reads well.<br />This is no comprehensive history of Africa; rather, Gates  explores something of interest in each of the countries he visits (the  relations between ancient Nubia and Egypt, Christianity in Ethiopia; the  ancient library at Timbuktu; the Eastern slave trade and African/Arab  lineage of the Swahili; the Western slave trade and the Asante Kingdom; and  megalithic ruins in Southern Africa).  Gates writes a middle course between  two opposing camps: the outmoded &quot;Africa has no history&quot; and the  extreme &quot;All civilization originated in Africa&quot;.  Gates is no  scholar of the history of Africa (and he makes this clear in the opening of  the book).  Readers who know little about Africa will certainly find much  of interest here and will enjoy learning about Africa along with Gates.   Students of African history might wonder what all the fuss is about.   Everyone will admire the beautiful sepia-toned photographs by Lynn Davis.   The book is filled out with well-chosen quotations from a variety of  historic writers as well as vintage illustrations.  Notes on sources are  provided.  <br />It is a pity that Gates did not travel in central Africa,  along the Congo River.  That's the part of Sub-Saharan Africa with no  ancient books (like Timbuktu), no lost cities of stone (like Southern  Africa and Sudan), noancient priesthood or empire (like Ethiopia).  It  would heve been very interesting to see what Gates would have made of  it.<br />A full-fledged and highly recommended history of Africa is  &quot;Africa: A Biography of the Continent&quot; by John Reader.

Long ruled by Omani Arabs, Zanzibar  had achieved hegemony on the coast of Eastern Africa and had grown rich on  the harvest of slaves and ivory from the continent and spices (especially  cloves) from Zanzibar island itself.  They had spread their influence and  Swahili language as far west as Kisangani on the Congo river (the setting  for V.S. Naipaul's &quot;A Bend in the River&quot;).  Times were changing:  European traders and missionaries were the harbingers of colonization for  the continent, protectorate status for Zanzibar, and the crusade against  the Eastern slave trade.<br />Sayyida eloped with a German and had to leave  Zanzibar.  She moved to Germany where she was eventually widowed and alone  (her Islamic family in Zanzibar rejected her for marrying a European  Christian.)  She wrote this book for her children, to provide them a record  of her history.  In it she describes life in the Zanzibar royal palace and  plantations: traditions, customs, palace intrigues and overthrows, the  harem, slaves, festivals, manners, the status of women, and so forth.  She  compares her life in Europe to her life in Zanzibar.  This book should be  of value to anyone interested in Zanzibar or Eastern Africa, or Arab,  Islamic, or Women's studies.<br />Please see my other reviews of books about  Africa.	2000-08-03

As far as I know, this is the only book that focuses on being an African among African-Americans, and being an  African-American among Africans. Philippe Wamba, born of a African-American  mother and a Congolese father, was raised in the United States, Congo, and  Tanzania.  Growing up he is always partially the outsider, not fitting in  completely among Africans nor African-Americans.  He astutely observes  relations between Africans and African-Americans on both continents.  His  personal and family history and anecdotes are interesting enough, but they  are only half his book.  His book is also a thoughtful and very  well-researched essay on various connections (and disconnections) of  Africans, African-Americans, their culture, history, and relations.  He  discusses everthing and everyone from James Aggrey to Maya Angelou, Edward  Blyden to James Brown, the Congo Free State to the Cosby Show.  These two  strains are woven together quite well: throughout the book his family's  story sets the scene for a lesson in African history or a review of  African-American literature, which in turn, leads to the next topic in his  own story. (In this way the book reminded me of &quot;Zen and the Art of  Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; by Robert Pirsig, which is both a story of a  father-son motorcycle trip as well as a history of Western philosopy.)  The  book contains useful notes, a bibliography, and an index.  Highly  recommended.	2000-07-28

He played a  significant role in the nation's history, and was actually named Viceroy of  Ouidah by an Abomey king.<br />Chatwin's &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot;  (his fist novel, written after visiting West Africa) is a very well written  book.  I found it a pleasure to read, hard to put down (it is one of the  few books I have read in a single sitting).  It is a short book: nothing in  Chatwin's text is extraneous; every sentence advances his story, which is  an intriguing blend of fact and fiction, past and present.<br />Werner Herzog  made a film titled &quot;Cobra Verde&quot; (1988, starring   Klaus Kinski)  which is based on &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot;.

Certainly it contained  what was then the largest collection of recipes from Sub-Saharan Africa  ever assembled (it may hold that record still).  The cuisine of Northern  Africa is well represented (no surprise; there are far more cookbooks of  Northern African recipes than Sub-Saharan recipes).  Of the recipes from  Sub-Saharan Africa: Western and Eastern Africa are well represented.  The  Southern African (e.g., South African) recipes are mostly of the Dutch and  Malay variety (to be fair, the apartheid policy made it impossible to  investigate the gastronomy of other South Africa peoples).  There are very  few recipes from Central Africa, as is usually the case with African  cookbooks.<br />The recipes are good ones, well selected to be both authentic  representations of African cuisine, and easy for the non-African cook to  prepare and appreciate.  Most of the ingredients are easy to obtain outside  of Africa.<br />Harva Hachten's book is just as much a piece of journalism as  a cookbook (though of course there are numerous recipes).  She collected  her information on African cooking on a few lengthy trips through Africa in  the 1960's.  What appears in the book is largely what she happened to run   into as she made it her job to meet people, try their foods, and ask for  their recipes.<br />Recipes and introductory tests are arranged by region:   North Africa; West Africa; Southern Africa; Central Africa; East Africa.   There is a glossary and a list of ingredient substitutions.  A table of  contents listing the recipes would have been useful (they are included in  an index.)	2000-07-09

Barbara Kingsolver uses multiple narrators to tell the story of an American missionary who takes his family to the Belgian Congo in the  last days of colonial rule.  It is compelling reading, there are many  memorable scenes and images, and several very suspenseful moments.  The  characters, both the missionary family as well as the local Congolese, are  well drawn.  The book's historical background is equally interesting.  This  is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a good novel, even moreso for anyone  interested in Africa.<br />There have been few English-language novels set in  Congo (Zaire), but two of them (&quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; by Joseph  Conrad and &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; by V. S. Naipaul ) rank among  the best in English literature.  &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; will take  its place alongside these classics.  Taken together, the three novels tell  the story of the Congo in the 20th century: Conrad's story covers the early  Belgian Congo colonial period; Kingsolver's novel is set at the end of the  colonial period and the coming of independence; Naipaul's novel is set  during the rule of Zaire's first strongman Mobutu Sese Seko.<br />&quot;King  Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial  Africa&quot; by Adam Hochschild is a non-fiction approach to the story of  the Belgian Congo and its aftermath.	2000-06-29

His theory that  the cats of Lamu are descendents of a lost breed of cat from ancient Egypt  is quite interesting.

Amazingly, Stanley  decided to approach Equatoria from the Atlantic side of Africa by going up  the Congo river and overland through central African forest. The expedition  crossed hundreds of miles of then-unknown Africa, encountering every  obstacle and difficulty along the way.  The eventual end of the mission is  one of history's great ironies, but I don't want to give anything away.   <br />&quot;The Last Hero&quot; is a very well-written adventure story, all  the more interesting because it is true.  My only complaint (a very minor  one) concerns the absence of notes and bibliography which could have given  some historical documentation and sources.<br />Another good book is &quot;The  River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration and Exploitation of the World's  Most Dramatic River&quot; (nonfiction) which is also by Peter Forbath (a  journalist who reported on Africa).  Henry Morton Stanley was also a  bestselling author, he wrote: &quot;How I Found Livingstone&quot; (1872);  &quot;Through the Dark Continent&quot; (1878); and &quot;In Darkest  Africa&quot; (1890).	2000-06-22

This, her first book, is a very relaxed, informal affair, more like a  friendly conversation really, as if you had met Hepburn and told her you  were interested in Africa, and she started, &quot;Oh I was in Africa  once...&quot;  It's Hollywood in Africa, 1951.  Some of what she writes is  now a kind of history: where else might you learn that airplanes once had  sleeping-berths like Pullman railway cars.  Of course, mostly there is  movie-making: working with director John Huston, and co-stars Humphrey  Bogart and Robert Morley; how the cast and crew managed their equipment and  wardrobes on location; the boat itself and the Ruiki river; living  conditions in the temporary camp (including some very practical advice  concerning improvised toilet facilities), colonial-era hotels and travel,  and so on.  The hardcover edition is illustrated with dozens of  photographs.  An interesting and charming book for anyone with an interest  in Africa, classic Hollywood movies, or Hepburn, Huston, or Bogart.  <br />Peter Viertel, who worked with Huston on &quot;The African Queen&quot;  also wrote a book about the experience titled &quot;White Hunter, Black  Heart&quot; which Clint Eastwood made into a movie.	2000-06-13

The  book is often interesting and amusing, especially the reproductions of  advertisments for clothing and other essentials.

Her story is remarkable.  In the 1890's, unmarried and no longer having to care for her parents, Kingsley decides she should  travel in &quot;the tropics&quot; and sets off for &quot;West Africa&quot;  (i.e., the West coast of Central Africa).  She travels as a scientist,  collecting fish specimens, and finances her travels by trading along the  way--but mostly she travels for the love of adventure and to satisfy an  appetite for the unknown.<br />Kingsley's book is a treasure trove of  information about Atlantic-coast Central Africa in the late 1800's.  But  beyond its historic and sociological value, the book is just wonderful. Her  descriptions are vivid, her insights interesting, and her understated humor  is a joy.  Anyone with a love of exploration and a good story would enjoy  this book.    <br />The Everyman edition is an abridged version (edited by  Elspeth Huxley, of &quot;The Flame Trees of Thika&quot; fame).  Older,  unabridged versions are highly recommended.<br />Readers with a particular  interest in Gabon should also see the works of Robert Nassau, an American  missionary who was in Gabon when Kingsley traveled there.  Evidently they  met and discussed all things African at length, though Kingsley makes  little mention of him.  Nassau wrote &quot;Fetichism in West Africa&quot;,  &quot;In an Elephant Corral&quot; and &quot;My Ogowe&quot;, but doesn't get  the credit he deserves.  Also of interest is &quot;One Dry Season: In the  Footsteps of Mary Kingsley&quot; by Caroline Alexander. Alexander visited  Gabon in the 1980's and compared what she saw then to what Kingsley had  seen a century earlier.	2000-06-09

The novel's protagonists are an aristocratic family in the empire of Segu (now part of  Mali) swept up in the historical currents of the time: Islam, Christianity,  European imperialism, and the Atlantic Slave trade.  As with  &quot;Roots&quot;, the story is told from the African perspective, which is  refreshing and much needed.  The novel is well written and filled with  abundant historical detail.  There are many deatils here that a student  might research in a library, for example: the different lifestyles of the  Fulani and Bambara and relations between them; the &quot;Brazilians&quot;  in Africa, former slaves from South America that managed to return to  Africa; the socio-economic status of Africans of mixed-(European and  African) ancestry.<br />It seems a pity that many young people are forced to  read this book in school; hopefully they will return to it when they have  the maturity to understand and appreciate it.	2000-06-07

This book is unique.  It is  not a cookbook, there are no recipes; rather it is a memoir of meals, food,  and hospitality encountered over decades of living and traveling in Africa.   Anyone with an interest in African cuisine would do well to obtain this  book.  Van der Post is very much the intellectual; he shares his thoughts  as well as a description of interesting, unusual, and just plain good  African food.  He is an African of European ancestry.  His views of  Africans are never racist nor prejudiced, and it is clear he has a genuine  respect and admiration for traditional African people and their mode of  living, but at times his writing may strike some contemporary readers as a  bit dated.  Nevertheless, he is always an interesting and informed writer  who has written much that is worth reading.<br />  Some (not all) of this book  is similar to the text of his &quot;Recipes: African Cooking--Foods of the  World&quot; (published by Time-Life, 1970), which is a complete cookbook  with recipes as well as much introductory text (It is a two-volume  publication: large coffee-table book of text and pictures, plus a small  spiral bound book of recipes).	2000-06-01

He is far from what we would call  &quot;politically correct&quot;.  But he wrote so much and so well, and is  practically the only writer to travel in Eastern Africa in the 1850's that  is in print today (except for John Hanning Speke who was with him on this  trip, and who wrote &quot;Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the  Nile&quot;).  <br />To put this book in context it is wise to read something  about Burton, particulary Burton and Speke in Africa; know why in  &quot;Lake Regions&quot; Burton never refers to Speke by name.  (Or see the  movie: &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot;)<br />The book is a detailed  chronological account of nearly three years of difficult travel between  Zanzibar and Lake Tanganyika.  Nothing escapes Burton's observation.  He  writes of everything from the local hairstyles to the price of pombe  (traditional beer).  He gives detailed descriptions of the landscape,  geography, flora, and fauna.  He writes of Arabs and the Eastern slave  trade.  He depicts safari life in the days of human porters and mules.  He  tells of the people he encounters; his descriptions of Africans may be  offensive to some.  There is a wealth of information here, something for  everyone with an interest in Eastern Africa, or exploration, or  imperialism.  The place names have sometimes changed from Burton's time to  ours, as have the English spelling conventions of Swahili words.    Anyone  with any interest in Eastern Africa, especially the precolonial period,  should arm themselves with a good atlas and reference book and read Burton.	2000-05-28

You hear his African stories, his opinions, his knowledge of animals and hunting. The book proceeds chronologically and contains many excellent descriptions of tracking and hunting African game (these might become redundant for some readers). Readers might also be disturbed by his description of what he perceived as the inferiority of certain African peoples, and the need for Africans to be &quot;civilized&quot; through European rule. He also believed in the rightness of making parts of Africa (the best parts of course) a &quot;white man's country&quot; for European settlers, though he insists that &quot;the African native should be treated fairly&quot;--how this would be accomplished is not discussed. Still...<br />&quot;African Game Trails&quot; is a wonderful book for anyone interested in East Africa in the early 1900's, or for anyone interested in Theodore Roosevelt. It was his love of the outdoors, of nature, and of hunting (not contridictions in his time) that led Roosevelt to spend a significant amount of his life in the world's wide open spaces away from &quot;civilization&quot;. It is clear that he, like many great thinkers (Beethoven comes to mind), found solace and renewal in the fresh air and quiet of plains, forests, and mountains. He spent almost a year on his African safari. His book was the first by an American to popularize the idea of recreational travel in Africa (still considered a daunting prospect by many Americans today). The prose is easy to read and makes one want to keep reading. Also of interest is the appendix containing the list of books (the &quot;pigskin library&quot;) that he took with him on his safari.<br />Roosevelt also promoted the outdoor life and its benefits in &quot;A Book-Lover's Holidays in the Open&quot; (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916)	2000-05-10

These two areas are highlands and  mountainous, rather atypical of Africa.  With the help of colonial officers  and numerous African guides and porters he completed the assignment, filed  his report and later wrote this short book.<br />&quot;Venture to the  Interior&quot; is a thoughful, philosophical, and introspective account of  the expedition.  Van der Post very much writes in the style of travel  writers like Bruce Chatwin and Paul Theroux; the reader sees as much of a   mental landscape (Van der Post's) as a geographical one.  He describes the  journey, both the physical and the mental, in prose that is honest and  clear.  His thoughts on Africa are usually interesting and often  profound.<br />The people he encounters and writes about are mostly Europeans:  the district officer, the businessman, the settler-farmer.  It would have  been nice had he written more about the African population.  Still,  overall, this is a book well worth reading for those interested in Africa,  exploration, travel writing.<br />Most of Van der Post's other books are also  well written and well worth reading.	2000-05-08

Ms. Harris has done a very good job, and this  is a welcome addition to the small (but growing) collection of African  cookbooks.  Many African dishes (e.g., Poulet Yassa or Groundnut Stew)  deserve to be as well known as classic dishes from Europe, Asia, or the  Americas, and Ms. Harris is doing something to make make these dishes  better known.  She has also collected a great many lesser known recipes, so  there's something here for everyone.  To the extent that she provides some  information about African food, it tends to be anecdotal, though nothing is  incorrect as far as I can tell.  It may be a bit too much to expect one  book to describe the gastronomy of an entire continent.  (Could we imagine  a book called &quot;The Europe Cookbook: Tastes of a Continent&quot;?) and  therein is the problem.  <br />This book's title says &quot;continent&quot;  and it contains recipes from Western Africa, Eastern Africa, Southern  Africa and some from Northern Africa.  My real complaint is the complete  absence of recipes from Central Africa -- the Congo River basin area.  This  willful ignorance (in the sense of &quot;to ignore&quot;) of Central Africa  seems to be common among &quot;fair-weather Africanists&quot;; it also  occurs in &quot;Wonders of the African World&quot; by Henry Louis Gates.   It is distressing to see that even as we enter the 21st millenium there is  still a &quot;dark place&quot;, an unknown place on the map of Africa, much  as Conrad described in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; over a century ago.   True, there has been a civil war going on in Congo, and before that Zaire  was not an easy place to travel. But there are many Congolese who live in  Europe and America who could have provided insight into to the gastronomic  traditions of Central Africa.  Ms. Harris seems to have picked only the low  hanging fruit.  Of course it is much easier and pleasant to travel and dine  in Senegal and Ivory Coast, or Kenya and Zanzibar rather than Congo and the  Central African Republic, but if you want to say your book covers the  continent, you can't ignore the very heart of Africa. <br />Ms. Harris has  written a good book, despite the fact that it ignores the very heart of  Africa.  If you're interested in cooking you should have some African  recipe collections; this is a good one.  Other good African cookooks that  contain not only recipes but also very good writing that puts the recipes  into a cultural context (but also mostly ignore Central Africa) are:   <br />Ellen Gibson Wilson - &quot;A West African Cookbook: An introduction to  food from Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.&quot;<br />Laurens van  der Post - &quot;Foods Of The World: African Cooking&quot; (from Time-Life)  and &quot;First catch your Eland: a taste of Africa&quot;	2000-04-18

Furthermore,  the majority of books about Africa of this era (mostly by explorers and  missionaries; few or none by Africans) are long out of print and can only  be accessed in mjor libraries. Given that, Burton's work is a valuable and  readable account of a voyage along Africa's West Coast, as far south as  Fernando Po (Equatorial Guinea). (We should be thankful for the publisher.)  His text is direct and readable. The account is chronological, port by  port. Burton describes the the places and people and whatever catches his  interest. His opinion is always present. Burton goes into many  details--trade, early colonial administration, rulers, languages, etc.--and  it is unlikely that any one reader would be interested in all of it, but  most students of African history are likely to find something of interest.  There is no index.  It should be noted that Burton has plenty of scorn and  disdain for many of the Africans he encounters (as well as for many  Europeans); this is typical for Burton, but may upset a reader who is new  to this writer.<br />Many of the names (of places, tribes, etc.) are  antiquated so a good reference book is a help. <br />Overall this is not  Burton's best book, but it does have a place along with his other books on  Africa (&quot;First Footsteps in East Africa&quot;, &quot;The Lake Regions  of Central Africa&quot;) and it adds something of value to the reputation  of the great writer, explorer, traveler, and translator who produced  &quot;Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al Madinah and Mecca&quot; and  &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;.	2000-04-14

The novel is set in the city of Kisangani, on the Congo River in Congo (formerly the Zaire river in Zaire) -- though interestingly, the author never says this explicitly.  I have never seen an account as to what Naipaul's experiences in Zaire were exactly, but he manages to tell the story of the early days of Zaire's independence, after colonial rule as the Belgian Congo. <br />The protagonist is a young Indian from the Eastern coast.  (&quot;Indian&quot; in the sense of his ethnicity, his family has been in Africa longer than they can remember.)  He has purchased a shop in Kisangani, and trys to build up his business as the &quot;big man&quot; consolidates power in the newly independent country.  Things go from bad to worse, for the new shopkeeper and the country.  Though this is fiction, every word is true.   <br />Naipaul writes beautifully, and has many insights into Africa, colonialism, history, and life.  This is one of the few books that I have read and enjoyed more than once.<br />Some people recommend Chinua Achebe's &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; to readers looking for an &quot;African&quot; novel.  But to recommend &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; over &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; makes sense only if you can read just a single book about Africa. Achebe's novel is set in Nigeria; Naipaul's is about Zaire. It's like saying don't bother with &quot;Brothers Karamozov&quot;, read &quot;Great Expectations&quot; instead. I should hope a serious reader would turn his attention to both.<br />(The last days of the Belgian Congo is the setting for Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;. Many good nonfiction stories from this time and place are found in &quot;A Doctor's Life: Unique Stories&quot; by William T. Close.  A literary approach to the early days of the Belgian Congo is Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.)	2000-04-14
