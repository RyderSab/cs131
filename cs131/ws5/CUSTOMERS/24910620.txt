I started the book and immediately thought this woman was crazy, a looney, a wack job. After getting a feel for the book I realized that although this woman seemed crazy to me, I related SOME things to her. It's been awhile but years ago I remember going through a break up that was hard to let go. Now, I was in high school and that to me is a teenager thing but I could relate. Different phases, different situations but probably all the same feelings. This book jumps around to different things which keeps you interested on her journeys, all the while learning a little about canning. Something I know NOTHING about. In the end it comes together, it's a amazing how all the jumble of stories, times, thoughts come together to show a lesson learned. Now, I have a feeling each reader will take something completely different from this book, a lesson of some sort!<br /><br />My favorite line was (I think) from page 85 or 86. She talks about her phase of collecting things. All sorts of things. One being wooden birds on sticks for her garden/yard. her neighbor yells at her \\"your like Martha Stewart on crack!\\" I loved it. It was a total giggle out loud!	2005-10-07

I'm sure by now you've read what this story is about, so I'll just give my two cents.  This is a great quick book that easily sucks you into the the story line.  I loved all the characters these boys would meet.  I loved the references to the books these boys read.  Especially, because the stories were familiar!  I was thrilled to have found this and can't wait to read Dai Sijie's most recent novel.  I would also recommend \\"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\\" if you enjoyed this book.	2005-07-10

Generally, only women have a special relationship with chocolate, we crave it. I think this book will have a special place in the heart of women, just like chocolate! A book women will relate to, understand, and love. I was engrossed in this novel. From the very start I could feel the hearts of these women. I didn't understand such a hard time and culture. Chinese women in this novel with stood so much pain. If it wasn't for the other women, I doubt they could of made it. Before reading this novel I had never heard of nu-shu or footbinding. So, I not only enjoyed a story but learned something as well. I think I could have gone without knowing some of the culture of the 1800's. The pain hurt my heart. However, the strength of these women was amazing, and filled me with pleasure. This is one of those books you will read, put on a shelf, and eventually read again. You'll want to pass on to your daughter, or your sister. You won't forget Lily or Snow Flower, because their bond will last forever.	2005-06-29

I was expecting more about coyotes and an adventure type book.  Nope, this was about love and so much more.<br /><br />A book of family, families cultures and beliefs, extended family, mystery, love, secrets, romance and coyotes!  You not only learn something in this book but you fall in love with it!<br /><br />My only complaint is that this is the authors only novel so far!  I will be waiting for more.  Especially if I can fall in love with more characters.  Way to go Jessica!	2005-06-06

Not only is this book about sisters and their relationship, but it's about love, betrayal, growing old, living through trauma, marriage, business, and the list continues.  You WILL fall in love with Lola.  You will fall in love with Ellen.  You will struggle to find the truth in the sisters.  They will slowly let you into their hearts and let down their guard.  This is one of those books that grabs ahold of you because you love these characters.  The book toys with you, one minute you will laugh and the next you will feel the tears in your eyes.  You will be given information that will shock you for a split second, then the story will unfold behind the information.  My next stop is to find this authors web site and be informed about all her writing.  I am a true fan and would recommend this to any bookclub, as long as your meetings are long because this one can be talked about for hours!  A true jewel!	2005-05-17

I suppose Tess is just one of those characters I couldn't relate to, she didn't seem real to me.  I loved Casey, I thought she was a jewel.  So real and full of life.  Kenny was fine, I just have a hard time believing he left his current girlfriend for a girl he had dreams about years ago.  And that Tess just fell head over heals for him after doing nothing but talking bad about him.  I will read more from this author but I would stay away from this one if I were you.

What ever your current situation might be, you can always change it.  It might not be easy but it can always be different.  A good lifes lesson for people who complain alot!<br /><br />I loved meeting the different characters (this is my first book by this author).  I found each one so different it was funny to see them all in one place.  And get along so well.  Except for Amy that is!<br /><br />I'd say this is very predictable, but like most stories that are similar to this I can expect that.  I wasn't dissappointed by this because I could read into it.  I do generally like a curve ball thrown in but this was what I expected and very enjoyable.  There was enough going on in this I didn't get bored.  Although, I've noticed some of the reviewers think this is not as good as other books she has wrote.  So, that makes me even happier to go read Dorothea Benton Frank's other books.	2005-05-04

I love a book about 'psychos' it is truly creepy. So, this book was right up my alley. I love being scared by more of a 'true to life' experience. Well, we have all read about real life weirdo's so this was perfect. The novel takes you from character to character. Each chapter is something new. AND, once and awhile at the end of a chapter something makes you hold your breath...and you won't know what happens until you read a few more chapters to get back to that character. True on the edge of your seat writing. Brett McBean is truly a great horror writer and you should have this story added to your horror collection! I await the next book by McBean!	2005-05-02

Running With Scissors kept me going because 'things we're always happening/changing.' This was pretty much just about being in AA, drinking, trying to deal with relationships, more drinking...oh, and then more drinking. I think this could of been a shorter book.

There were some gruesome parts in this but it seemed more of a thriller  to me.  I have to admit that the whole underground hospital thing was creepy!  An underground psycho ward, and under that the \\"Night Cages\\"-really spooky.  I enjoyed this quick read but it didn't have any \\"oh my God\\" thrills for me.	2005-04-25

In every Sparks book I am SO glued to it I can't put it down.  This one I bought the day it came out and FINALLY finished it  a week and a half later.  I couldn't absorb this story.  I could read the ending right after meeting Doris and knowing about her 'power'.  I NEVER guess Sparks endings.  I am usually the one crying my eyes out, smiling that he blindsided me with something I did NOT expect!  This was like every other romance novel. Nothing spectacular.  I didn't like Jeremy.  He seemed to perfect in that 'stud' way, I couldn't tell how genuine he was.  Lexie just struck me as being the 'let's feel sorry for me' type.  Too sappy and I just didn't get into it.  I want to at least give this a three star 'OK' rating but can't because I was disappointed in this.	2005-04-22

Her words are amazing. I was transformed into the characters minds...if that makes sense.  I felt apart of the characters.  Each character is suffering something in this book and in a weird way I can almost relate or feel these characters sorrows.  The power of the women in this book fascinates me.  They are so close, so tight like the knots they tie in this story.  I just loved it.  Kidd's writing is so giving, all the details layed out, everything described perfectly.  Her writing just doesn't get boring.  I refused to skip over words-scared I'll miss something.  Well, as you can tell I loved this.  As well as the Secret Life of Bees.  I treasure books that teach me things about life, and her books do just that!  I shed tears in this, not because of sadness but because I felt perfect closure for these characters.  Something that so many books lack.  This book I hold high on a pedestal.	2005-04-07

You meet all sorts of different characters in this, along with numerous zombies.  I normally don't get into zombie books but this was a good one!  Really gross, flesh falling off, intestines dragging, body parts missing gross.  I actually had to make faces reading this which actually means this book was really good!  The only problem I had with this ride was the ending.  WHAT ENDING is a better choice of words.  I am either an idiot and didn't completely \\"get it\\" or it just didn't give me enough information to process this.  Now, since my reading of the book-yesterday, I did a search on the web and found out there is a sequel.  This NOW helps me to understand it a little better!  Keene's writing is super and I will look for more of his books.	2005-04-05

I fell in love with these characters and their lives...hard lives.  This book takes you from childhood to ultimately death of the main character Nella.  The book moved along quickly but gave plenty of information so I didn't feel cheated.  Nella has a hard life.  I worried about Nella and her family.  I just waited for her life to collapse.  It didn't, Nella was a strong character, so strong in fact that the ending left me very sad.  She came into my life as quickly as she left.  I'd recommend this to any Trigiani book lover.  It's ONE of her best!	2005-03-30

She lost her daughter to cancer and is now trying to cope with her job and home life.  She struggles with her son and husband.  It's almost as if she's a child sturggling to deal with life.  It's almost as if she doesn't know what she wants.  She wants to be a good mother and wife but all she see's is the pain from losing the daughter a few years prior.  I have not lost a child so it seemed hard to feel for this character.  Some of the choices she makes isn't what I think a normal person would choose.  But again, I have not lost a child so I suppose I can't say what I'd do.  The book was over as quick as it started.  I didn't feel as though I got to know Miranda the way I would have liked.  I felt sorry for this character but didn't feel a bond with the character either.  I wanted in to Miranda's head.  But, so did everyone else!  The ocean and the end seemed alright I suppose.  I did think it was a little odd to take her son out so far in the ocean assuming she could \\"hang on to him.\\"  What parent does this?  So that seemed a little far fetched to me.  It's one thing to be in the ocean playing but another to take a child past the waves.  So, overall I think it was an ok story.  I didn't connect with this like I have done with other books so I didn't rate it as strong.	2005-03-29

I can only hope we return to the amazing writing of Big Stone Gap in book three.  This one was ok, maybe because I loved returning to a beautiful place and time.  I loved the characters returning to make me laugh.  These things were all hear in round two but without the heart.  The story was ok, I loved visiting Italy and watching Etta grow up.  But missed the amazement of Big Stone Gap that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I didn't find this had any suprise in it.  Just a story of a married couple trying to cope with life.

I wasn't sure how to take it in.  Sometimes I wanted to laugh but felt guilty for doing so.  This (i think) was a wonderful story.  I kept thinking how odd that I enjoyed it so much when so much seemed so awful.  I think the way it was written kept me from feeling guilty about enjoying this.  The characters all seemed to know they were a bit crazy.  Everyone had some sort of \\"issue\\".  From Dr. Finch, to Agnes to Augusten.  Some seemed to have more issues than others that's for sure.  I find it hard to believe it took me so long to read this.  Since I took my time I am now able to enjoy \\"Dry\\" right away.  I find it hard to recommend this book but at the same time find it just as hard not to.  Bizarre, funny, witty, horrible, weird...all wrapped into one.	2005-03-07

I loved being kept in the dark at the beginning...I couldn't wait to find out what the heck was going on in Maggie's life. I was hyped by the first few chapters. I also love a book that flips back and forth from characters or time frames. This makes you so excited finish a chapter to jump to another character, then back again! This book did that and that's a plus for me! About three quarters way through the book it was starting to get old for me. The story is about Maggie and Sam (husband and wife) trying to find out who kidnapped their son and how to get him back. Maggie takes off to find her son on her own and Sam stays hot on her trail to find his own answers, which includes trying to find out who Maggie is and what kind of trouble she's gotten their son into. Sam stays a step behind Maggie for most of the book. In my opinion I got tired of the chase between the two and it seemed Sam would finally get somewhere close to Maggie and she'd disappear again. This is fine generally but in this story it got old. That's where I lost interest. Then to top it off it seemed like the ending didn't have that 'POW' I was looking for. So, all in all it was good, I'm just not sure I'd tell anyone to 'run right out and buy it.'	2005-03-02

Nothing fancy, nothing amazing...just a darn good book.  I loved this community and the characters the author created.  I was pulled in and watched this town grow.  This story was about much more than Ava Maria and her search for answers.  It was about this town and the people who made this such a rich place to visit.

Ok, it was a good topic, sounded interesting...was interesting but then it just started going down hill.  The idea of some weird guy witnessing a murder and being excited about it-is weird enough.  Then to have this guy go after the murderers because he was so excited about the murder they committed is crazy.  That idea of this sounded like an edge of your seat book.  It seemed somewhere in the middle this things changed.  It started by diving into the cops mind about his problems when the story was about the murderers and the psycho that kidnaps them.  I kept wondering why I was getting so much information about this cop...what role did he play in this?  When the ending finally came around I didn't even know it.  I turned the page to go on to the next chapter and there were no other chapters.  It was over.  I did one of those things were you read the last few paragraphs wondering, \\"did I miss something?\\"  So, the plot was good enough but I can't say this was worth too much of your time.	2005-02-10

Out of all the books I have read I found this to be a typical Laymon.  Some of his books have that \\"amazing\\" last page.  This one didn't.  In fact I thought this one left a lot (of what I would consider) important information out.  I hate a book that leaves me asking questions at the end.  Without giving anything away, I wanted to know about the \\"hole\\" and \\"more history\\" to this.  The book did move very fast and as most Laymon novels go...it had me at the edge of my seat the entire time.	2004-09-01

An emotional account of what goes through a fathers mind in these unthinkable instances.  I didn't think this was a predictable book what so ever.  I was not expecting this story to turn in the end.  This story of a father and son will be in my mind for a long time.  It makes you want to be a better person, no matter how wonderful you might already be.  It makes you want to take that extra time or effort in a relationship...especially with your children.  I can not say enough about what I've read from Kirk Martin.  I highly recommend his books!	2004-08-18

This is truly a book for women, although I think men would benefit from some of the romantic gestures. I could NOT wait for Anna to make a decision. In fact I was sure I had it all figured out. I loved how she tried to find ways to deal with her heart and tried so hard to come up with the right decision. My heart went out to her. My mouth dropped as the bomb was dropped towards the end. I did not expect the unexpected. From that point on I needed tissue. So much lead up to this point and I couldn't believe it was over. I am so glad I married my soul mate and never had to question my heart!	2004-08-02

I am dissappointed to know it's a part of a trilogy and now I must find the other two books to read!  This is more gore than most of his books but it didn't stop me from loving it.  This is Laymon and the ending is a jaw dropping thrill!	2004-07-29

I enjoy his writing-although a tad bit far fetched at times.  I wasn't sure how I'd like this 1800's book with a western theme.  Well, I can't say enough good things about it.  Trevor/Willy was a great character, who got himself in all kinds of trouble.  I have to say if your a Laymon fan, get your hands on this book it is well worth the hunting for it!	2004-07-15

I read this book recently to my 7 year old son.  Wanting to show him the power of books.  I was worried he'd be upset by the ending in this.  I shouldn't of worried.  I was the one who ended up crying and reading it to him at the same time.  As an adult I felt foolish.  He wasn't near as upset about it as me and I KNEW what was going to happen since I read it as a child myself.  WOW, the power of a book.  Simply amazing.	2004-07-14

This was the first book I have read by Mosley so I am not familiar with his other books or how he writes.  I can say this is NOT what I expected.  Saying this it's hard to explain what I had trouble with.  I suppose I assumed a more mysterious or evil reasoning for the cage.  I just waited for there to be more.  There wasn't.  I don't think this was a bad book, for the most part I enjoyed it.  I just had some other ideas about it and it dissappointed me.	2004-07-12

I don't like to give away how stories are told but I have to say I wasn't expecting what happened in this book.  I am amazed at how much I loved these characters.  This is one of those books you don't want to end.  This was my first book by Leclaire and it will not be my last.  She is a wonderful heartfelt writer that makes me excited to find her books.	2004-07-08

He tried his best to manipulate Barton.  Although it took a lot out of him he was very brave in this story.  The only problem I had was the last 60 pages or so.  The story just got weird.  Then at the very last chapter Billy wanted to go somewhere (I don't want to give anything away) and I just thought as a parent that was a little to weird.  Overall a pretty good book.	2004-07-06

I loved learning some things about autism and how families cope with it.  I loved hearing the story from this young boys point of view.  The mystery of this was wonderful, a mytery in a mystery.  Chistopher was a delight to meet and follow through this story!	2004-07-06

His last two have been wonderful and I have managed to read both of them in one sitting. I love the idea of writing letters-to tell a story. This story manages two love stories in one book AND throws in a little mystery at the same time. I can't imagine a tougher life than the one Jennifer is leading. So many different obstacles to overcome. She is very lucky to have Sam in her life. I won't spoil any of the book I'll just say it's an amazing read and I will cherish this as much as I do Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas!	2004-06-29

I know that in trying to have my 2nd child it took longer than I wanted and I was so dissappointed.  I felt so sorry for Avery.  The book examines this husband/wife relationship and how they cope with change.  Sometimes I found myself sticking up for Avery and other times sticking up for Dan.  Sometimes in an arguement with a spouse you only see your side and block out the other persons point of view.  I found myself loving the idea of seeing both sides.  It sure opens your eyes!  Each of these characters talk to their friends and family more than each other and you just start wishing they would talk together.  Then Avery starts to fall for someone else and everything is spinning out of control.  All this is happening while Daniel is trying to start his new life with this family.  Well, I loved it.	2004-06-25

Ok, my husband caught me and took over knowing how obsessed I was with this book.  I first thought this wouldn't be my cup of tea because it was talked about lawyers and court.  I do not get into books where I am left wondering what's going on because I am not familiar with the setting.  I figured I'd get lost in criminal courtroom jargon.  This was not the case.  This was layed out very nice and very easy to read.  It moved very fast.  It is full of twists and I swear I kept thinking I knew what was happening I figured I was going to figure it out.  Not the case.  I think I figured just about everyone a crook, criminal or somehow involved!  Just a wonderful read and well worth hardcover prices!	2004-06-23
US	24910620	R138NX1VZ01PO0	188147562X	596027330	Come Out Tonight	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Way out there.	As a Laymon fan I have to say this has got to win the &quot;most far fetched&quot; award.  Yes, Laymon is typical of far fetched novels but this wins hands down!  Sherry is in for one heck of a night.  I continued to ask myself &quot;why&quot; doesn't she ever call the police.  I'm sure that would be a Laymon no-no, but geez this book just gets farther and farther away from reality.  I found myself saying &quot;oh, come on-this can't be happening.&quot;  When a book just gets to unrealistic for me I have a hard time staying interested.  This is one of them.  I love Laymon and will continue to hunt down books he wrote.  I just hope this is the worst!	2004-06-22

I didn't have an abusive father but I did have a best friend and could completly relate to the story about growing up.  Fighting with your best friend, thinking your in love and kissing your first boy.  This story not only tells about growing up but also how kids cope with losing a parent.  These kids are left with an abusive father that has limited parenting skills.  I was glad Berg didn't dwell on the abuse or keep this story depressing.  As much as parts were unsettling it was also a good story of friendship and hope for these sisters.  I would recommend this book to my family and friends as a quick read about growing up.	2004-06-17
