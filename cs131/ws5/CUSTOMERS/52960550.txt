Henry of Science Fiction	Fredric Brown was best known as a science fiction writer with a flair for the surprise ending.  Actually, he wrote more mysteries than he did science fiction.  His only series, the Ed & Am Hunter mysteries, ran to seven novels.  This volume collects the first four.<br /><br />\\"The Fabulous Clip Joint\\" (which won an Edgar): Ed Hunter's father, an alcoholic printer with a shrewish wife, is murdered on his way home from a late night binge. Aside from an alcoholic witch of a stepmother and an over-sexed younger stepsister (neither of whom he particularly likes) the only family Ed has left is Uncle Ambrose, an itinerant carnival worker that Ed hasn't seen in over a decade. Ed searches out his Uncle Am and together they set off on a quest to find and punish the killer. Under Uncle Am's guidance Ed learns (1) that his father wasn't the mediocrity Ed thought him to be, (2) that he, Ed, is capable of much more than he ever imagined, and (3) who killed his father.<br /><br />\\"Dead Ringer\\": In a lateral logic puzzle, the author gives you a set of seemingly incongruous facts forming a \\"fair play\\" mystery. If you can fit the facts together correctly, you can solve the mystery. \\"Dead Ringer\\" is a lateral logic puzzle. All the pertinent facts are there. You just have to recognize which ones are relevant and the solution is obvious. At least it's obvious after Ed and Am Hunter explain how the facts fit together. A naked midget is found stabbed to death at the carnival. Later a chimpanzee drowns, and finally a child dies. Through the first two deaths, Ed and Am Hunter mind their own business. The third death stirs them to action, and the mystery is quickly solved. They arrive at the solution independently, but Am gets there a little quicker than Ed.<br /><br />\\"The Bloody Moonlight\\": Ed Hunter, rookie detective with the Starlock Detective Agency, gets his first solo case. He goes to the country to check out an investment opportunity for a wealthy young lady who's appealing for more reasons than the size of her bank account. He has trouble sinking his teeth into the assignment because of a beautiful girl who isn't what she seems, a disappearing body, and a narrow minded sheriff who shoots first and asks questions later. On his way to interview the inventor, who may be in radio contact with Mars or Jupiter, Ed finds a body with the throat torn out. Ed leaves the body, finds a phone, and reports the crime. When the sheriff can't find the body, he beats Ed up, which makes Ed determined to [1] return the favor, and [2] find the body again. The plot thickens as Ed unravels who killed whom, the true identity of his dream girl, and exactly where those radio signals are coming from. He gets everything sorted out, and then confronts the problem of keeping the sheriff from killing him before he can expose whodunnit.<br /><br />\\"Compliments of a Fiend\\": In one of his books on the paranormal, Charles Fort wrote of the disappearance in Mexico of the author Ambrose Bierce. He then mentioned the disappearance (several years later and almost a continent away) of another man named Ambrose, and asked whether there might not be an Ambrose Collector at work. It is against this backdrop that a gentleman calling himself Ambrose Collector telephones the Starlock Detective Agency asking for an operative who had experience with carnivals. Starlock dispatches Am(brose) Hunter, and he falls off the face of the earth. When Ed Hunter begins to miss his Uncle Am, a mutual friend opines that he must have been gotten by the Ambrose Collector. With only this clue to go on, Ed begins the search for his uncle. The investigation lurches along with no apparent progress, but all the while Ed is unwittingly gathering clues. When Ed solves the problem of the missing 45 minutes, the clues fall into place. Now Ed must not only find his uncle, but also survive the discovery.of her bank account.

All others taught that history was an endless progression of ever-repeating cycles.  You can find an echo of that philosophy in the Book of Ecclesiastes.<br /><br />The revolutionary nature of the Jewish concept of history having a beginning and working toward an end can easily be overlooked, so ingrained is it in modern thought.<br /><br />The Old Testament is not an easy read, even in a modern translation.  Cahill gives a selective abridgement of the Old Testament story, along with a commentary.  You can fault him for his selectivity or disagree with his analysis, but he elucidates a very important concept.<br /><br />This concept, the non-cyclical nature of history, was adopted by Christian theology, and it served to help engender the rise of the West.  Cahill's book, along with the others in his \\"Hinges of History\\" series, is well worth reading.	2005-09-09

The ending of \\"Clipjoint\\" is all-the-more surprising because he telegraphs the identity of the killer but still manages to bring off a number of unexpected twists.<br /><br />I've known and enjoyed Fredric Brown for decades as a science fiction writer.

With three warships, a crew of cutthroats, and the help of Cleopatra, princess of Egypt, Decius manages to keep from getting himself killed by the pirates, but garners no glory.<br /><br />Then the Roman governor of Cyprus is murdered, and Decius believes the solution of the murder will also be the solution to the pirates.  He just hopes that it wasn't Cleopatra behind it all.  Although Decius has been fairly astute in figuring out whodunnit in previous installments of the series, he displays little deductive ability as he thrashes about in search of a solution.<br /><br />The SPQR series is peopled with a continuing cast of likeable, engaging characters as well as thoroughgoing rogues.  Hermes, Decius' slave, continues to develop.  Julia, Decius' wife, is ever helpful.  Julius Caesar and Pompey are offstage, but their influence is still felt.  Titus Milo puts in a brief appearance. We are introduced to another interesting character in Ariston, the \\"reformed\\" pirate.  We can only hope that Ariston becomes a regular in the series.	2005-08-01

If our God is the one true God, those who worship other Gods are sadly mistaken and must be corrected.  We can correct by persuasion or coercion.  Missionaries choose persuasion.  Countries which make it a capital offense to proselytize a religion other than the state religion choose coercion.<br /><br />Stark studies the history of religious conflict and the conditions under which religious tolerance can flourish.  Two powerful religions sharing the same turf will come into conflict.  E.g. Northern Ireland (Protestant versus Catholic), Bosnia (Christian versus Muslim).  Multiple religions sharing the same turf can hammer out a modus vivendi of living together with respect for one another.  E.g.  The United States, where the vast number of creeds and sects, from Amish to Zen Buddhist, live together, not only without trying to kill each other, but for the most part quite courteously.<br /><br />He observes that, although American creeds practice courtesy, secularists do not, speaking in the most scurrilous and derogatory fashion about those who believe in God in general and Fundamentalists in particular.  I'd like to see him write a book on the causes of such religious intolerance from those who have little or no religion.	2005-07-31

He further asserts that the rediscovery of Classical wisdom impeded rather than enhanced the growth of Science.<br /><br />\\"Aristotle's Children\\" argues that Islam's rejection of Aristotle led to scientific stagnation whereas the West's embracing Aristotle spurred scientific discovery. \\"For the Glory of God\\" stands for the proposition that, had the West rediscovered Aristotle too soon, Science might never have come to be.  Science did not conquer Christianity, the Christian concept of God gave birth to Science. Read the book to see how this could be.<br /><br />Stark says a number of other things which don't square with the conventional wisdom on religion.

Hagrid is still playing with his blast-ended screwts.  Dobby is as loyal to Harry as ever, and Kreacher is as big a pain as ever.  Harry is still the star Seeker on his house's team, and Ron is still having a crisis of confidence as the team's Keeper.  Malfoy is still malevolent, Harry still suspects Professor Snape of treachery, and Professor Dumbledore still trusts Snape completely.<br /><br />Everything has changed around Hogwarts.  Harry has fewer childish escapades.  His conflict with Malfoy takes a sinister direction.  With the help of the Half Blood Prince, Harry begins to excel at Potions.  Student mishaps around Hogwarts become more common and more deadly.  The world grows darker as Lord Voldemort waxes stronger and stronger and kills more and more witches and wizards.  Dumbledore, who's beginning to show his age, starts giving Harry private lessons.  Bertie Botts' Every Flavor Beans are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />\\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" revealed that Harry was destined to meet Voldemort in a conflict which only one of them could survive.  In \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" Harry begins to learn what he must do in order to have any hope of winning.<br /><br />\\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" was a light-hearted romp.  The saga took a somewhat sinister turn in \\"The Chamber of Secrets,\\" and in \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" it became downright gloomy.  Each succeeding installment of the saga has been darker than its predecessor, and \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" is darkest of all.  You might even say that \\"Half Blood Prince\\" is to the Potter saga what \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" was to the Star Wars saga.  Dedicated Potter fan will come away from the book impatient for the final installment to wash away the gloom of the penultimate installment.<br /><br />I haven't given more than passing consideration to Rowling's sources, but I think the discerning reader can see some indebtedness to previous writers of fantasy.  The names of the characters put one in mind of Bunyan's \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\"  Although Rowling isn't quite as heavy-handed as Bunyan in naming her characters, the names often give us insight into who the characters are.  E.g.  Deloris Umbridge takes great umbrage at the lest infraction of the rules.  Professor Lupin is a werewolf.  The Malfoy family is certainly malevolent.  Harry is sure that Professor Snape is a Snake.  The name-fits-personality pattern does not apply to all the characters.  Only one of the Weasleys is a weasel.  The wizard school has already been done in at least two fantasy series: \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" and \\"The Black Cauldron.\\"  Harry struggles to get piecemeal clues about his identity and his fate much as Corwin does in the \\"Chronicles of Amber.\\"  Children thrown into an unfamiliar magical world has already been done in \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia.\\"  Finally, Voldemort bears a more than passing resemblance to Sauron of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" while Dumbledore looks more and more like Gandalf with each succeeding book.<br /><br />Rowling has nicely set up the final installment, and her legion of fans will await it with bated breath and more than a little trepidation as to whether the good guys can win.

What is it? Why is there so much of it?  How does it resemble, yet differ from, lying?  The book is not only erudite and articulate, it is succinct, short, and small.  I found the size/price ratio somewhat disconcerting.<br /><br />Frankfurt, for all his study, fails to discern the origin of the term MBE.  The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that the term \\"bull\\" comes from the old French word \\"boule,\\" meaning fraud, deceit, trickery, or foolishness.  Thus \\"bull\\" is the correct term and \\"bull****\\" is a scatalogical intensifier.<br /><br />Frankfurt misses another point.  MBE is most certainly hot air spouted without regard for accuracy.  I submit that scholarly discourse on trivialities is also MBE.  For example, Frankfurt's book -- or this review.	2005-05-19

Quite by coincidence, I audited this CD immediately upon the heels of auditing Plato's \\"Phaedo.\\"  \\"Phaedo,\\" set upon the day of Socrates's execution, gives a mediation upon how we should live given the immortality of the human soul. In Phaedo, Socrates argues for immortality of the human soul and then speaks of how that should influence our behavior.  \\"Phaedo\\" is Plato's version of \\"The Purpose Driven Life.\\"<br /><br />Much of what Warren says echos the words Socrates spoke over 2,000 years ago.  Warren's book certainly doesn't compare to \\"Phaedo\\" as either great literature, great philosophy,or great theology.  His language is much simpler, and he buttresses his arguments with scriptural citations where Plato supports his with logical analysis.  I doubt that Warren set out to write great literature, but he succeeds well in giving an easily understood exposition of how Christian faith should affect our actions.<br /><br />\\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" doesn't quite put the moral philosophy of \\"Phaedo\\" on a Christian foundation, but sufficient parallels exist to suggest that a \\"purpose driven life\\" can transcend Christianity.	2005-05-09

If he was a conservative, he was a rather liberal one.  Some of the ideas he voices would be anathema to conservatives.  E.g.  Wealth concentrated into fewer and fewer hands should be redistributed to the have nots.  Liberals on the other hand, would be distressed by other of his views.  E.g.  Once the wealth gets redistributed, government should not attempt to prevent the talented and industrious from re-accumulating it.<br /><br />The paradox is not really paradoxical at all.  Obscene wealth in the hands of a very few causes unrest (and eventually revolution) among the obscenely poor.  On the other hand, if industry and talent are not rewarded, culture stagnates.  Durant gives the fall of the Roman Republic as an example of an obscenely rich aristocracy committing political suicide by refusing to peacefully redistribute some of their wealth to the poor.  The economic stagnation of Communist East Europe serves as an example of what happens when you stop the natural flow of wealth back to the talented and industrious.<br /><br />Durant makes some statements that would get him lynched in the 21st Century American media.  E.g.  \\"Only those who are below average really want equality.\\"<br /><br />Durant is probably most accurately classified as an agnostic, but he says that on balance, religion has done far more good than harm for civilization.  Durant contends that civilizations and cultures decline and die when they lose their moral compass.  And they lose their moral compass when they lose their religion.  Simply put, those contemplating crime are more likely to be detered by the wrath of God than the long arm of the law.<br /><br />Durant voices many other thought-provoking opinions.  You may not agree with everything he says (his wife doesn't), but you will certainly be stimulated to deep thought by what he says.<br /><br />I was somewhat amused by the interviews interspersed among the chapters.  The reverential awe shown by Durant's interviewer was quite neatly counterbalanced by the sardonic wit of Durant's wife, Ariel.  When Durant said something she didn't agree with, she let you know about it and gave excellent reasons for her disagreement.  Durant quite wisely did what any intelligent husband would do.  He almost always let her have the last word.t), but you will certainly be stimulated to deep thought by what he says.   <br /> <br />I was somewhat amused by the interviews interspersed among the chapters.

Production values are excellent, and the actors deliver their lines in conversational fashion, without a hint of the wooden presentation that is almost impossible to avoid when speaking the written word.<br /><br />I have read and re-read the \\"Apology\\" several times, but never have I been so engaged by the dialogue as when I heard it in this edition.  Socrates comes across as somewhat eccentric, somewhat arrogant, but completely honorable.  His sense of dignity renders him incapable of mounting an effective defense against the criminal charges, and indeed he really doesn't attempt to defend against the charges.  Instead, he seeks to justify himself and his career to his students and to posterity.  He thoroughly achieves this aim.  Unfortunately, in the process of justifying himself to posterity, he thoroughly enraged the jury, and they voted for the death penalty by a landslide.  It was almost as though that was what Socrates wanted them to do.<br /><br />\\"Phaedo\\" records Socrates' last day, as he fearlessly faces death.  In his last hours he and his friends discuss Socrates' ideas on the immortality of the human soul.  Socrates wandered far afield as he spoke on the soul, and the philosophic exposition is both flawed and uninteresting.  About halfway through the dialogue, I became impatient for Socrates to go ahead and drink the hemlock and put me out of my misery.  I stuck to the end, however, and having done so, I realized that the beauty of \\"Phaedo\\" lay not in the philosophy, but in the courageous and dignified bearing of Socrates as he confronted death.<br /><br />The attitude of the executioner to the condemned man is striking.  Whereas Luke records the centurion who executed Christ as saying \\"Surely this man was innocent,\\"  Plato records Socrates' executioner as crying and begging Socrates' forgiveness.  If you are not moved by the death scene, you are hard-hearted indeed.records Socrates' executioner as crying and begging Socrates' forgiveness.

When I recently reached for the book again, I found it so dilapidated I decided to go onto Amazon.com to see if I could find a better copy.  I bought this volume and found it to be quite satisfactory.<br /><br />Two things the reader must know:  1.  The quality of the poetry is very uneven.  Some of it is perfectly wretched.  2.  The book was published during an era of ethnic insensitivity, and the book reflects that insensitivity.<br /><br />If you can overlook these two shortcomings, the book can be a rewarding reading experience.

Rubenstein doesn't set out to answer this question, but his work stands as authority for the proposition that ancient wisdom, specifically the works of Aristotle, changed the balance in favor of the West.<br /><br />During the early Middle Ages, while Europeans were beating each other over the heads with poorly forged swords, Islamic civilization was at its zenith, and Arabic \\"falsafa\\" (philosophy) was the reason.  Europe had completely forgotten Aristotle, but the Arabs knew his works and studied them earnestly.<br /><br />During the 1200 to 1400's, the \\"Reconquista\\" recovered both Spain and Aristotle from the Arabs.  Over the next few centuries, both cultures struggled to reconcile science with religion.  Religion won an unconditional victory in the Moslem world and Islamic civilization went into decline.<br /><br />Rubenstein records the initial enthusiastic acceptance of science by Europe, the uneasy truce that developed between science and religion, and the ultimate \\"victory\\" of science over religion.  Ironically, the men whose work formed the foundation for that victory were almost uniformly men of religion.  Rubenstein argues for a modern detente between science and religion similar to Stephen Jay Gould's concept NOMA (which is described in Gould's book \\"Rocks of Ages\\").  Zealots from the camps of both science and religion would do well to read these two books.<br /><br />Since reading this book, I have read Rodney Stark's \\"The Victory of Reason\\" and \\"How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization\\" by Thomas Woods.  Taken together, these books give a quite different perspective on Aristotle, Christianity, and the Middle Ages.  Stark also wrote \\"One True God\\" and \\"For the Glory of God,\\" which further elaborate some of the ideas put forth in \\"The Victory of Reason\\" and \\"How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.\\"rate some of the ideas put forth in \\"The Victory of Reason\\" and \\"How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.\\"	2005-02-11

He has tottered on the brink of retirement for the past 30 or so years, until in the last few Rumpole books it strains credulity that he could still be kicking around.  In my review of \\"Rumpole and the Primrose Path\\" I expressed the wish that future opuses come from Rumpole's youth.  Finally, Mortimer has given us a story of the youthful Rumpole.<br /><br />Rumpole earned his wings and made his reputation just after WWII by trying and winning the infamous Penge Bungalow Murders.  I believe that Rumpole has made passing references to his famous victory at least once in every Rumpole story.  In this work he not only makes a passing reference, he tells the full story.<br /><br />Rumpole is attending a chambers meeting when he once again mentions his famous victory.  Sadly, the younger barristers haven't a clue as to what he's talking about.  He undertakes to inform them.  Rumpole-aholics (and newcomers to the series) will be delighted with the results.	2004-11-26

I could see Sherlock Holmes and James Bond, but the rest went right over my head.

He was an elderly barrister nearing the end of his career when he made his debut back in the 1970's. Now, thirty some odd years later, he must be pushing 100. I hoped that any future Rumpole opuses would come from his as-yet-unchronicled youth.<br /><br />Such was not the case. This latest offering has Rumpole fully recovered from his heart attack and showing the vigor of a youngster in his early sixties. Apparently Mortimer has decided to stop the aging process and keep Rumpole's age forever on the edge of retirement. I, for one, approve. Although the plots in this last book are not as complex as in earlier stories, the mysteries are still as satisfying as ever. The supporting cast of regulars has subsided somewhat into the background and more attention is shown to Rumpole's relationship with his wife, Hilda.<br /><br />Although possibly not quite up to the high standards of the first stories in the Rumpole Saga, the stories in this book are quite satisfying.	2004-09-09

The cross exams are varied. Davies even includes the Prophet Daniel's legendary cross examination of the Elders from the Apocryphal book of Susanna.  The maxims are loosely classified under general headings, and the whole work is begun with a 40 some-odd page table of contents.  The table gives each maxim in full and then gives an abstract of the exposition which follows.  You get the gist of the bood reading just the table of contents.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the price.  There are better modern expositions of cross examination available, but their prices will run to approximately four times the price of this book.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment with the book is its narrowness.  Davies' first principle states that the purpose of cross examination is to cast doubt on the other side's presentation.  That is one of many different objectives you can achieve on cross examination and sometimes it is not even the most important objective you can achieve on cross examination.  The over-arching objective of cross examination is to persuade the factfinder that your cause is just and that your side should prevail.	2004-08-22

What arguments can they marshal in favor of their positions?  Nicholi scours the writings of these two men and juxtaposes their contrasting views on the eternal questions.  He also explores the life experiences which helped to mold each man into the person that he was.  Neither man had a happy childhood.  Most telling to me, however, was the exposition of what their worldviews did to their personalities.  I spent the first half of my life buying into the stereotype of the happy Godless versus the unhappy Godly (piety isn't supposed to be fun).  Lewis & Freud turn that stereotype on its head.  Lewis was much the happier man.<br /><br />You can weigh the arguments of Lewis & Freud one against another, award debating points, and declare winners and losers, but this book will not definitively answer any of the eternal questions referred to in the title.  Although the book doesn't answer the question of the hereafter, it does answer the question of which worldview is going to make you a happier person here-and-now.<br /><br />One could say that the contrasting lives of Lewis and Freud provide empirical evidence for the wisdom of Pascal's wager.	2004-08-19

In the book he seeks to recount the 'prehistory' of Amber, and does a fair job, but there are discrepancies with Zelazny's Amber. E.g., I don't think Chaos threw Shadows in the original Amber series. Zelazny's Chaos was a wild, unreal place where the laws of physics had never been enacted. Any Shadows cast by Chaos would definitely not be the mundane worlds through which Oberon and Dworkin travel.<br /><br />The greatest difference is not in the story itself, but in the way it is told. Zelazny was a master wordsmith whose prose bordered on poetry. He was to science fiction what Raymond Chandler was to the mystery genre. Betancourt can tell a story, but his diction is more logical than lyrical.<br /><br />There is a great cliffhanger ending, however, and I am interested enough to read the second installment, 'Chaos and Amber,' which is in paperback. The third, 'To Rule in Amber,' is not yet released. I'm probably going to wait until it comes out in paperback to finish off the trilogy.	2004-08-03

Roman military history is full of crushing defeats--Allia, Cannae, and Carrhae, to name a few. None of these battles 'stopped' Rome. Neither did the Teutoberger Forest. Although it broke Augustus' spirit, succeeding emperors were undeterred and expansionist. Rome's failure to conquer Germany was due, not to the military acumen of Arminius, but to three things:<br />  1. The decentralized body politic of Germania. The U.S. confronts a similar problem today in the Iraqi insurgency. It's hard to pacify a country which has no central government to surrender and tell its citizens to stop fighting. Rome solved a similar decentralization problem in Spain in the wake of the Second Punic War, but Spain did not present the next problem.<br />  2. The complete unsuitability of the legionary system for waging war in heavy forests. Close order heavy infantry needs lots of level, wide open spaces to maneuver. Think of the caricature of the Minutemen firing from behind trees on the Redcoats marching by with parade ground precision.<br />  3. There is just so much area that a pretechnological government can control, and Rome was near its limit.<br /><br />  Notwithstanding the flawed premise of the book, Wells gives an interesting account. He starts with the biographies of the three protagonists: Augustus, the aging Emperor who wandered the halls of his palace saying 'Varus, Varus, give me back my legions'; Varus, the doomed general who paid the price for the dual sins of overtrust in a treacherous German 'ally' and underestimation of the tactical and logistical problems of marching three legions through such inhospitable terrain; and Arminius, the duplicitous Roman auxiliary soldier who forsook his hard-won Roman citizenship to betray his mentor, Varus. During Rome's long history, it confronted many admirable war leaders:  Pyrrhus, Hannibal, Massinissa, Jugurtha, Spartacus, Vercingetorix.  Arminius is not one of them.<br /><br />  Wells next describes life on the fringes of Empire, and then gets down to the business of recounting the battle.  He gives little credence to the written accounts of the battle, and concentrates on the archaeology of the battle. The general course of the battle may have gone as he describes, but it is implausible to think that it was over as quickly as Wells believes. The German light infantry would not have been able to bowl over seasoned, battle-hardened troops easily. Jugurtha twice caught Marius just as flat-footed as Arminius caught Varus, and Marius was able to fight his way through. Coincidentally, Marius was marching to winter quarters just as Varus was. The Romans should have been able to put up a stubborn enough resistance to draw the battle out to the three days reported in the written histories.the business of recounting the battle.

These heretics seem to have had a worldview not much out of step with modern avant-garde thought. Chesterton's critique of these ideas is lucid, lyrical, and logical.

No historical fiction I have ever read brings Republican Rome to life better than SPQR.  The mysteries through the first four books haven't been all that mystical, but the excitement moves the stories along quite well.<br /><br />Decius Metellus the Younger is a minor Roman Senator who serves in a series of menial government jobs and finds murder, mayhem, and mystery everywhere he goes.  Each of the first three books of the series has ended with Decius fleeing Rome to escape the homicidal fury of those he has angered.<br /><br />This story is different in that it takes place during one of Decius' many enforced absences from Rome.  He goes to Egypt with a diplomatic mission headed by his uncle, Metellus Creticus.  The book reads somewhat like a 'Lonely Planet' guidebook as Decius explores the city of Alexandria, visiting the Jewish Quarter, the Palace of the Ptolemies, the Pharos lighthouse, the Library, and many other long forgotten landmarks including the Temple of the Muses.<br /><br />Decius encounters murder in the Temple, and being offended that so vile a crime could occur in so holy a place, he sets out to solve the murder and avenge the Muses.  He manages to get on the wrong side of almost everyone he comes in contact with, evades a number of attempts on his own life, and uncovers a plot to overthrow the Roman influence in Egypt.  When he wakes up one morning with a hangover and a murdered courtesan in his bed, things really get complicated.  Not only does he get himself arrested for murder, he has a very hard time explaining things to his fiance.  Not surprisingly, the story ends with the murder solved, the plot foiled, and Decius leaving the city in a very undignified manner.	2004-07-31

Good advice, but where did the aphorism come from? &quot;SPQR III&quot; gives a humorous answer to that question, and also gives us a rolicking good story of love, murder, and political intrigue.<br /><br /> One engaging aspect of the SPQR series is the ensemble of remarkable characters who reappear book after book. Quintus Caecilius Metellus the Elder, a battle scarred, no-nonsense soldier and politician who is both proud of and embarrassed by his eccentric son. Metellus Creticus, a dour man who happens to be one of the most powerful soldier-politicians in Rome. Titus Milo, a handsome, muscular organized crime boss who doesn't need weapons to defend himself. Asclepiodes, a talented physician who specializes in stitching up gladiators and performing autopsies. Fausta and Clodia, two women who are as heartless as they are beautiful. Publius Clodius, a reprobate who has only two ambitions--to become the most powerful man in Rome and to kill Decius Metellus the Younger.<br /><br /> In this book Roberts makes two exemplary additions to the ensemble: Julia, niece of Julius Caesar, love of Decius' life, and no mean detective in her own right. And finally, Hermes, a lazy, hungry, insolent slave whose cupidity sometimes interferes with his loyalty to Decius his master.<br /><br /> &quot;SPQR III&quot; follows the same plot as the first two offerings in this series. Decius investigates a sacrilege, becomes embroiled in a series of murders, uncovers a plot which threatens the very existence of Rome, dodges repeated attempts on his life as he pulls off a caper which saves the Republic, and flees Rome pursued by assassins. The mystery is not so much &quot;whodunnit&quot; as &quot;how's Decius going to keep from getting himself killed?&quot; It's all good fun.	2004-07-31

They almost invariably got themselves involved in politics and stirred up trouble. You had to have the Emperor's permission to form a club. When the Roman governor Pliny the Younger got complaints about an outlaw political club calling themselves Christians, he wrote to the Emperor Trajan seeking guidance as to how to deal with them.<br /><br /> When Pliny found that they were engaged in nothing more sinister than worship and instruction in right living, he wanted to be as kind as possible. He told Trajan he had decided not to condemn anyone on the basis of rumor and not to put anyone to death who renounced Christianity. Trajan approved.<br /><br /> Pliny's perspective is the first of five 'outside looking in' perspectives of ancient Christianity presented in this book. The physician Galen, the philosophers Celsus and Porphyry, and the Emperor Julian the Apostate also wrote about this upstart religion, and it is instructive to see how Roman attitudes changed over the years.<br /><br /> Galen thought of Christianity as a second-rate philosophy which had many admirable characteristics, but was ultimately based on fallacious reasoning. Celsus, the first pagan thinker to study Christianity in depth, took Christians to task for what he saw as all sorts of lunatic ideas. Porphyry penned what is probably the most incisive critique of Christianity ever written. Julian attacked Christianity with the fervor characteristic of many former Christians. He not only sought to discredit it with literature, he sought to destroy it with legislation. Interestingly, one of the laws with which Julian sought to undermine Christianity dealt with public education. Apparently Julian didn't like prayer in schools any more than the modern Supreme Court.<br /><br /> Wilken gives an engaging study of the hostile world into which Christianity was born, and in which it matured. This book does little to explain the miracle of how Christianity survived and thrived in the face of such opposition, but that is not its purpose. It admirably achieves its purpose of describing that hostile world.d thrived in the face of such opposition, but that is not its purpose.

US	52960550	R1RBVSN7H0IBW	0735202974	149602614	Patton on Leadership	Books	5	4	5	N	N	The Analects of Patton	Axelrod gleans Patton's speeches and writings to distill what he believed to be Patton's philosophy of leadership. He also includes a few memoirs of Patton by those who knew him personally. Axelrod sets out each anecdote or saying in boldface and then gives a brief commentary on what he believes Patton meant by the statement. For the most part, the commentaries are superfluous. You could completely dispense with them except for the fact that they sometimes contain additional statements by and anecdotes about Patton.<br /><br /> Patton emerges as a talented but flawed leader. Contrary to his reputation as &quot;Old Blood and Guts,&quot; he was a humane commander who truly cared for the welfare of his troops. His statement that he'd rather waste ammunition than lives pretty well sums it up.<br /><br /> The book is well organized, entertaining, and informative on the subjects of both leadership and military history.	2004-07-23

Half the fun of Nero Wolfe is the comfortable interplay between and among familiar characters. This is especially true of Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. A neat mystery is set out, the characters banter back and forth as they set to solving it, and some sort of a caper is concocted to aid the solution.<br /><br /> The SPQR series seems to be in the same mold. The city is Rome in the declining years of the Republic, and some of the recurring characters are actual historical figures. There is no Nero Wolfe to sit idly sipping beer and thinking as Archie Goodwin does all the heavy lifting. Decius Caecilius Metellus must do both the thinking and the legwork. He's as accomplished as Archie Goodwin in handling the rough stuff, but he's not as sharp as Nero Wolfe in figuring out whodunnit.<br /><br /> The stories begin with Decius as a minor government functionary who encounters murder at every corner. As he sets about solving the murders, he invariably irritates powerful and dangerous men, uncovers a threat to the very existence of Rome, and dodges attempts on his life as he unravels the mystery. With each succeeding book through the first three, he climbs a little higher in Roman politics and makes more and more enemies.<br /><br /> In the first three books, there really won't be a lot of mystery about whodunnit if you're familiar with this period of ancient history, because Roberts is very faithful to the history. The real mystery, and what kept me turning the pages, is &quot;how's Decius going to survive solving the murders?&quot;<br /><br /> The conspiracy of Catiline is a familiar episode in Roman history. Sallust wrote a monograph about it. Cicero published his speeches on it. Maddox follows the course of the conspiracy very carefully. You can get the actual history of the conspiracy of Catelina from Sallust's monograph on the subject and from Cicero's recorded speeches against Catelina. If you're not familiar with the story, you might want to wait until you've read this book before reading the histories.<br /><br /> Now, if a mystery carefully follows the course of known historical events, how can there be any mystery to it? Furthermore, how can there be any entertainment value to it? Let me count the ways:<br /><br /> 1. If you don't know the history, you've still got a mystery. Even if you do, you'll have fun puzzling out Maddox's fictional details of the conspiracy.<br /><br /> 2. A good mystery derives as much entertainment value from the interplay of interesting characters as from the mysteries themselves. From Holmes and Watson to Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin and beyond, the cast of characters turns mediocre stories into very good stories. Much of the fun of the Decius Metellus stories comes from the interplay of the interesting characters Maddox peoples his stories with.<br /><br /> 3. Many mysteries (Columbo, e.g.) give the audience the culprit from the beginning, and the mystery is &quot;how's the good guy gonna catch the bad guy?&quot; In the Decius Metellus stories, the mystery is &quot;how's Decius going to survive?&quot; Decius alienates all the powerful men of Rome, foils numerous attempts on his life, and somehow escapes with his hide. Each of the first three stories ends with Decius, having solved the mystery, fleeing Rome pursued by Furies.<br /><br /> The stories start at a sedate pace, but as the tension builds the pace quickens. In the last third of the story things are happening at breakneck speed, and the reader breathes a sigh of relief as Decius hotfoots it out of Rome.<br /><br /> If you like history and you like mystery, you'll like this story of a young politician unwinding a serpentine plot to overthrow the government.corded speeches against Catelina.

It was the heyday of three of the greatest science fiction writers of all time (Asimov, Clark, & Heinlein, aka the Big Three), and there were many others writing who were almost as good.  A goodly number of them are represented in this collection.  Only Arthur Clark is missing.  The stories, with their writers, and my ratings:<br />***\\"Destination Moon\\" by Robert Heinlein.  This story was cutting edge for its day, but it has not aged very well.  The science is good, but the characters and motivations are somewhat far fetched.<br />***\\"Pebble in the Sky\\" by Isaac Asimov.  Another story based on a very interesting premise, but alas, the science hasn't held up.<br />*****\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" by Harry Bates.  Bates is not one of the greats of the early days of sci fi, but this is a great story.  Adapted from the excellent movie of the same name starring Michael Rennie, who reprises his role in this radio play.<br />****\\"The Man who was Death\\" by Alfred Bester.  This is an episode from \\"The Shadow.\\"  I'm no fan of the Shadow, but Bester was one of the best, and he turns in an excellent effort.<br />****\\"Almost Human\\" by Robert Bloch.  A story of robotics and computers.  The science hasn't aged gracefully, but the story is still engaging.<br />*****\\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" & \\"Zero Hour\\" by Ray Bradbury.  Two chilling speculations for the cold war/nuclear age.<br />***\\"Adam and the Darkest Day\\" by Wyllis Cooper.  Another cold war/nuclear age speculation. What might happen if thermonuclear explosions caused the Earth to slip its orbit and begin to recede from the Sun?  What if there were only three people left to rebuild civilization?<br />*****\\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\" by L. Sprague DeCamp.  DeCamp became more comfortable with sword and sorcery fantasy, but in his younger days he wrote very good science fiction.  This story resembles Ray Bradbury's \\"A Sound of Thunder.\\"  Both stories revolve around time travel, dinosaur hunting, and what might happen if someone tried to do something to change history.  \\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\" is the better story.<br />*****\\"Colony\\" by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" which was made into \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\" which was made into \\"Total Recall.\\"  In this story Dick explores the dangers of extraterrestrial colonization.<br />***\\"Speak no More\\" by Gordon Dickson, who explores an interesting premise, but goes astray with the denouement.<br />*****\\"Green Hills of Earth\\" by Robert Heinlein.  This story was from Heinlein's \\"Future History\\" series, about a blind space age poet who longed to return to the green hills of Earth.<br />*****\\"A Pail of Air\\" by Fritz Leiber, who is best known for his Fahfrd and the Grey Mouser series.  This tale demonstrates his virtuosity with speculative science fiction.  Another post-disaster story which finds the Earth in such a horrific Ice Age that the very atmosphere is frozen.  You have to go outside to get a pail of air to thaw out by the fire so you can breathe.<br />***\\"Oxychloride X\\" by Arch Oboler, who was not a science fiction writer, but was something like radio's answer to Alfred Hitchcock.  The protagonist invents a powerful acid, but... it's not really science fiction.<br />*****\\"The Seventh Victim\\" by Robert Silverberg.  I remember reading this story as a child.  I never saw the movie version (\\"The Tenth Victim\\"), but if it was as good as this radio rendition, it was very good indeed.<br />****\\"No Way Out\\" by Robert Silverberg.  Isaac Asimov is reputed to have said that if Silverberg had been born just a few years earlier, he would have been one of the Big Three rather than Asimov.  I don't know if I would go that far, but Silverberg does write an excellent story.<br />*****\\"Junkyard\\" by Clifford D. Simak.  Simak has the knack of making you laugh and scaring you at the same time.  \\"Junkyard\\" deals with the discovery of a junkyard on an abandoned planet.  The spaceship's crew eventually discovers the chilling solution to the mystery of how it got there.<br />***\\"Mr. Costello, Hero\\" by Theodore Sturgeon.  Sturgeon puts his talent for telling bizarre stories to good use in this speculation on human nature and political science.<br />*****\\"The War of the Worlds\\" by H.G. Wells.  Well, not really.  This is not the Orson Welles rendition of that story which frightened the nation back in the 30's.  It is a radio adaptation of the Oscar winning movie which starred Rod Taylor.  Dana Andrews stands in for Taylor in this adaptation, and the radio play might just be better than the movie version.rd on an abandoned planet.

I immediately ordered the first two books in the series and dove into \\"King's Gambit.\\"<br />I was disappointed.  The writing was pedestrian, and the solution to the murder mystery was obvious.  Decius Caecilius Metellus is a minor official with a talent for snooping.  A freed gladiator is found murdered in the streets of Rome on the same night as a warehouse fire.  Decius begins looking into the matter, and is warned off by his father and several other movers and shakers in Roman politics.  He obstinately pursues his duty of figuring out \\"whodunnit,\\"  employing such unorthodox means as consulting a medical doctor for insight into how wounds were inflicted.  So much for the first half of the book.  The second half makes up for the first, as young Decius navigates the treacherous waters of Roman politics and slips closer and closer to almost certain death as he tries to solve the mystery, save the Republic, and bring the conspirators to justice.  The story closes with Decius departing Rome pursued by Furies.  He was able to fashion an imperfect justice and save the Republic and his hide--but only just, and Rome will be too hot for him for several years to come.<br />The farther I read, the better the story got.  The writing improved, the characters became more engaging, and the plot thickened considerably.  I've read many historical novels set in Ancient Rome, but none seemed to bring Republican Rome to life quite as well as Roberts' little novel.  I haven't read the second novel in the series yet, but I've already ordered the third and fourth.	2004-07-10

Well, he did die valiantly (or quixotically) as a medieval samurai charging on horseback into gunfire, but he wasn't a reactionary.  He was a little bit more complicated than that.<br /><br />Instead of being the movie's staunch defender of the status quo, Takamori was instrumental in dismantling Japanese feudalism and bringing Japan into the 19th Century.  He embraced Western technology and admired some aspects of Western government.  Fierce in battle, compassionate in victory, loyal to a fault, tortured by his perception of himself as a failure, eager to embrace death before dishonor, this was a man who commanded such respect that he endangered the Meijin government by simply refusing to participate in it.<br /><br />How could one of the greatest supporters of the Meijin emperor rebel against his sovereign? How could one of the main architects of the moderinzation of Japan wind up charging on horseback into the murderous gunfire of the modern Japanese army? How could he in death be transformed into a hero of mythic proportions?  Read the book and find out.	2004-06-29

From there he goes on to explore the world of the Evangelists, and then he presents a chapter on each Gospel.  The individual Gospel chapters discuss the social settings and major themes of the Gospels, and give both an outline and a reading guide to the Gospels.<br />After dealing with the Canonical Gospels, Reddish considers the apocryphal/pseudepigraphical gospels, giving a description of each and discussing its relationship, if any, to the canonical Gospels.  Finally, Reddish turns to the Quest for the Historical Jesus, setting out and discussing in detail the scholarly criteria for determining historicity of the various Gospel accounts.<br />This slender volume has more breadth than depth, but it claims to be no more than an introduction to Gospel study.  It serves that purpose well.	2004-06-18

Books	5	114	125	N	N	Determined Attack, Dauntless Defense	In the mid 1500's the Ottoman Turk Suleiman the Magnificent was a septagenarian, but he still was the most powerful ruler in the world.  He had carved out an empire in the Middle East, and he wanted to expand it into Europe.<br />A small group of men on a miniscule island in the Mediterranean didn't exactly stand in his way, but they were a bloody nuisance.  They were the Knights of St. John of the Hospital, a relic of the Crusades.  Driven from the Holy Land, they had settled in Rhodes and become pirates preying on Moslem shipping.  The Turks had twice beseiged Rhodes and finally driven out the pesky Knights, but the Knights took refuge on Malta and continued to be a thorn in Suleiman's flesh.<br />Suleiman decided to destroy them, capture Malta, and use its port as a base of operations against Europe.  He sent an armada and an army to do the job, and a few thousand defenders faced off against tens of thousands of invaders.<br />The Turks decided to capture the harbor first so that their ships would have a safe haven against possible storms.  A small fort called Fort St. Elmo stood in their way.  They figured they could overwhelm the Fort in less than a week, occupy the harbor, and the rest of the island would soon fall to their attack.<br />When we think of famous last stands, we think of the Alamo and Thermopylae.  The Spartans withstood the Persians for 3 days at Thermopylae.  The Texans withstood the Mexicans for 13 at the Alamo.  Fort St. Elmo stood for an entire month before it finally succumbed.  The defenders of Fort St. Elmo fought stubbornly and to the last man, enduring unimaginable hardship, and they wrought terrible slaughter on the Turks.<br />When the fort fell, the Turks took no prisoners and mutilated the bodies of the fallen defenders.  Grand Master La Vallette of the Knights responded by decapitating all his Turkish POW's and using the severed heads as cannonballs to bombard the enemy.  Then the battle for Malta began in earnest, with no quarter asked and none given.<br />The seige of Malta is a gripping tale of brutality, courage, and tenacity peopled with larger-than-life protagonists like Suleiman the Magnificent, Grand Master La Vallette, and Dragut the Barbary Coast pirate.asked and none given.  <br />The seige of Malta is a gripping tale of brutality, courage, and tenacity peopled with larger-than-life protagonists like Suleiman the Magnificent, Grand Master La Vallette, and Dragut the Barbary Coast pirate.	2004-06-17

How could it possibly have enough information on it?  When I installed and opened the program, I was delighted.  The navigator comes with the HCSB and KJV standard, and you can upgrade to eleven additional versions.  It also has standard &quot;Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary&quot;, &quot;Easton's Illustrated Bible Dictionary&quot;, and a set of maps and photographs.  There are also numerous devotional helps. You get a 30 day preview of all the upgrades, which range from the 11 additional versions to John Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.<br />What I like best, however, is the HCSB translation.  It is as readable as any modern translation, and more readable than most. Its translation philosophy seems to be just the right mixture of &quot;formal equivalence&quot; versus &quot;functional equivalence.&quot; It is not an unreadable word for word rendering, nor is it a paraphrase which plays havoc with the Greek and Hebrew sentence structure.<br />The scholarship is excellent, the text is heavily footnoted, and technical terms such as &quot;Sheol&quot; are &quot;bulleted&quot;.  Put your cursor on the bullet, and a definition of the technical term pops up.  Put your cursor on the footnote number, and the footnote pops up.  Scriptural references in the footnote are hyperlinked to the actual passage.<br />You get quite a lot of navigator for a very reasonable price.	2004-05-30

The accomplishment of which he was most proud was his service at the Battle of Lepanto. He felt, as do many historians, that the battle saved Europe from conquest by the Turks. The battle may not have been quite as decisive as all that, but European history would have been quite different had the Spanish lost.<br />This book gives a readable account of this turning point in history, as well as a rousing account of, not only the battle itself, but the Seige of Malta, which served as a prelude to the battle.<br />That Lepanto was the high water mark of Spanish naval accomplishment is all the more remarkable in that it preceded by only a few years the debacle of the Invincible Armada.	2004-05-27

The second was \\"The Crusades: Flame of Islam,\\" and it treated with the later Crusades.<br />Lamb wrote military history engagingly, almost like it was historical fiction.  Most of his other historical works were biographies of great generals  -- from Hannibal to Alexander to Genghis Khan.  As a youth, I read as many of his books as I could find until I hit upon his biography of Alexander the Great.  I was sorely disappointed.  It was unabashedly historical fiction.  This caused me to doubt the historicity of his other works until I read Steven Runciman's three volume work on the Crusades.<br />Comparing Runciman to Lamb reassured me of \\"Iron Men's\\" basic historical merit.  It is fairly accurate and extremely well told.  Lamb starts with the turn of the millenium and moves to the Pope's preaching a crusade.  He describes the crusade of Peter the Hermit, and then gives an account of the First Crusade.<br />How on earth these naive, strategically clueless men-at-arms were able to wrest Jerusalem from Islamic control is beyond me.  They had only three things going for them -- Religious zeal, superb fighting ability, and excellent armor.	2004-05-18

He had this to say about the fraudulent Roman state religion of Christianity:<br />Nero, who was suspected of setting the fire, needed a scapegoat.  In order to point the finger of fault in another direction, he \\"fastened the guilt\\" on a group which was \\"hated for their abominations\\" --  Christians.  Tacitus went on to say that the group took its name from a man called Christus who was executed in Judea during the reign of Tiberius by the Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate.  Tacitus added that Christus' execution checked the \\"mischievous superstition\\" temporarily, but it sprang up again and even spread to Rome, where \\"all things hideous and shameful\\" eventually come.That evidence alone is sufficient to 1. Establish Jesus' existence as good history, and 2. Call into serious question the thesis that Christianity was created by members of various secret societies, mystery schools and religions in order to unify the Roman Empire under one state religion.<br />Interestingly, the author deals with Tacitus' notice by peremptorily dismissing it as a pious fraud.  The only reason advanced for this dismissal is the weak argument that, although the early Church fathers cited to various passages in Tacitus, they never referred to his mention of Christ.  There is an old saying in forensic science: \\"negative evidence proves nothing.\\"  The fact that the Church fathers didn't mention Tacitus' notice doesn't mean it wasn't there.  There's good reason for them not to mention it.  They could hardly be expected to call attention such an unflattering account of early Christians.  If some later interpolator were going to insert a fraudulent passage, they would have put something in a little more laudatory -- something along the lines of the pious reworking of Josephus' notice of Jesus.<br />The author's dismissal of the Tacitus passage as fraudulent puts me in mind of another old saying:  \\"When the law is against you, argue the facts.  When the facts are against you, argue the law.  When they're both against you, slander the other side.\\"<br />Based on sound historical evidence, you are free to make of Jesus what you will.  You may choose any of the horns of C.S. Lewis' trilemma: \\"Liar, Lunatic, or Lord,\\" but you cannot seriously deny his existence.

Beautiful English couple with excellent scholarship to make for a piece of literature that has helped shape our culture in ways we don't even suspect.<br />Unfortunately, the English language has changed somewhat over the past 400 years, and Biblical scholarship has advanced light years.  We need a new standard.  Although modern translations are thick as fleas on a dog's back, no one translation seems to stand out above the rest, and none compare to the KJV.<br />Finding a translation to replace the KJV has been an itch I've been trying to scratch for decades without much satisfaction.  I have tried almost every translation I can lay my hands on, from the Amplified Bible to the Simplified Bible, from the New American Bible to the New Jerusalem Bible.  You can find at least thirty different translations of the Bible on my bookshelves, and they have all been weighed against the KJV and found wanting.<br />Then I found the HCSB.  It is as readable as any modern translation, and more readable than most.  Its translation philosophy seems to be just the right mixture of \\"formal equivalence\\" versus \\"functional equivalence.\\"  It is not an unreadable word for word rendering, nor is it a paraphrase which plays havoc with the Greek and Hebrew sentence structure.<br />The scholarship is excellent, and the text is heavily footnoted with manuscript references and variant readings.  Sometimes it puts the variant I would prefer in the footnote. E.g. Genesis 37:3 speaks of Joseph's \\"robe of many colors\\" and puts \\"robe with long sleeves\\" in the footnote.  Translators can't quite decide how to translate that term, with a plurality opting for \\"many colors\\" a minority rendering \\"long sleeves,\\" and many opting for a middle ground such as \\"richly ornamented,\\" which could cover either meaning.  A long sleeved robe would be more likely to anger Joseph's brothers. It was unfit for manual labor, and Jacob's giving Joseph a long sleeved robe would mean he didn't expect him to work.<br />The translation philosophy seems to lean toward the traditional.  If there is a tie between a translation that conforms to the KJV and another translation, the KJV translation prevails.  As much as I like the KJV, I'm not sure that's a good criterion for selection between competing translations.<br />Most modern translations fumble the translation of technical words.  Take \\"Sheol,\\" for instance.  You could translate it \\"Hell\\" or \\"the grave\\" or leave it at \\"Sheol\\" and footnote it.<br />No rendering of the term is 100% satisfactory. The HCSB has made the best of a bad situation.  The translators devised an apparatus of bullets to place before such words.  When you come across a bulleted word, you know you're dealing with a technical term, and you can find its definition (or an explanation of what scholars think it may mean) in a glossary in the back.<br />So much for readability and reliability.  The work also has religious emphasis.  Translations can be readable and reliable without any hint of religion.  Hugh Schonfield, the author of \\"The Passover Plot\\" and \\"Those Incredible Christians,\\" has produced a translation of the New Testament that is readable and reliable. I prefer some of his translations to those any other Bible.  E.g. Although almost every translation I've ever read (including the HCSB)renders the weapon Jesus spoke of in Luke 22:36 as \\"sword,\\" Schonfield renders it \\"dagger.\\"  The Greek word is \\"Machairus,\\" which Liddel & Scott's \\"Greek-English Lexicon\\" defines as \\"dagger.\\"  The Jesus Seminar, no bastion of evangelical emphasis, produced the \\"Scholars' Version\\" of the Gospels, which is both readable and reliable, but one could hardly classify it as religious.<br />The HCSB, on the other hand, has some features that remind me of the Gideon's Bibles you can still find in most hotel rooms.  It presents the plan of salvation at the verybeginning of the book, and it has an appendix entitled \\"Where to Turn\\" that gives Bible references for all sorts of spiritual crises.  On the last page, you find a collection of passages with instructions on how to pray.<br />The HCSB is the perfect balm for my itch for a replacement for the KJV. I've worn out several KJV's over the years, and I plan to work my new HCSB just as hard as I have any of my previous KJV Bibles.

That 100 year old work still amazes and amuses with definitions such as &quot;Pray--To ask that the laws of the Universe be annulled on behalf of a single petitioner, confessedly unworthy.&quot;<br />This work seeks to mine the same sarcastic vein which Bierce worked to such good effect.  The result is somewhat uneven, and Bayan doesn't have quite the command of the English language that Bierce did.<br />At its best, however, &quot;The Cynic's Dictionary&quot; gives us definitions every bit as funny, not quite as caustic, and much more timely than Bierce's work.  E.g.:  &quot;Science Fiction--Fairy tales for nerds.&quot;  As a science fiction fan of many years' standing, I can wholeheartedly endorse that definition.	2004-05-01

The Bible was, of course, required reading.  The professor gave no clue whatsoever as to whether he was a believer, an atheist, or an agnostic, but he recommended that we read the King James Version of the Bible.  Back then, &quot;modern&quot; translations were coming out almost daily, and we questioned him why he wanted us to read a centuries old version.  &quot;Because you'll be exposed to good English,&quot; he said, and I had to agree.<br />In this recording, we have good English read well.  James Earl Jones has a distinctive, beautiful voice.  His voice is so distinctive that he was chosen as the voice of Darth Vader in the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.  He sounds much better reading the Bible than he did as the Dark Lord.<br />A few quibbles make me reduce my rating from five to four stars.  1.  Background music.  Jones' unadorned voice would have been better.  Also, the background music consisted largely of instrumental renditions of familiar hymns.  As the music played, the words to the hymns came to mind and competed for my attention with the words Jones was reading.  2.  Jones occasionally varies pronunications.  E.g.: In Matthew he calls the prisoner Pilate freed &quot;BARabbas,&quot; but in Mark it's &quot;baRABbas.&quot;<br />There's nothing in the quibbles, however, that should prevent you from thoroughly enjoying this rendition of the New Testament.	2004-04-30

The first two installments were &quot;Great Battles of Antiquity&quot; and &quot;Great Captains of Antiquity&quot;.  If the first two volumes were as good as this one, the three books constitute an excellent but expensive reference work for pre-gunpowder military history.<br />Gabriel begins with the earliest armies of the Ancient Near East and exhaustively studies the armed forces of almost every significant military power of ancient and medieval times.  He lays out the armament, logistics, organization and command structure, strategic and tactical doctrines, innovations, and political basis for each of these armies.  Gabriel makes a strong case for the proposition that the only area in which we exceed our ancestors is that of technology.  I was impressed by how much of what we think to be modern is of truly ancient vintage.<br />As good as the work was, I do have a few critiques:  Gabriel made extensive reference to military depictions in ancient sculpture.  Weaponry was described in great detail.  No photographs or other adequate illustrations of either appeared anywhere in the book.  The line drawings which were included did little to enlighten the reader.  The work would have benefitted greatly from the employment of a qualified proofreader.  Typographical errors abounded, but they were not sufficiently egregious that the reader couldn't cipher out what the author was trying to say.  As good as it was, I'm not sure the book was worth the extravagant price.  The best thing that can be said for the price is that &quot;Great Armies&quot; is the most inexpensive volume of the trilogy.	2004-04-21

I found it to be well written and well researched.  It tells the story of the Greco-Persian Wars in greater detail and with greater scholarship than just about anything else currently available.<br />Having recently read both &quot;Thermopylae: the Battle for the West,&quot; and &quot;The Greco-Persian Wars,&quot; (both of which cite this work extensively, and both of which are available on Amazon.com) I wanted to go back and re-read this apparently seminal work on the Greco-Persian Wars.<br />I was disappointed.  As a college student, I was used to reading scholarly tomes by academicians.  As a leisure reader, I am put off by the stilted grammar, complex sentence structure, and ostentatiously erudite diction of the professional scholar.  If there's a clear way to say something and an obscure way to say something, for heaven's sake, say it clearly!<br />If you have a tolerance for scholarly syntax, by all means read this book.  It is much more information dense than either &quot;Thermopylae&quot; or &quot;The Greco-Persian Wars.&quot;  If you want a much more readable history of the Greek defense of the West, read &quot;Thermopylae&quot; or &quot;The Greco-Persian Wars.&quot;	2004-04-13

Indeed, had Athens and Sparta lost, the Persians' Westward advance might have been stopped only by the Atlantic Ocean.<br />Victor Davis Hanson has written a number of works (e.g. \\"The Western Way of War\\" and \\"An Autumn of War\\") which posit that when East meets West, the outcome is a foregone conclusion--the West wins hands down every time. It is quite easy to get caught up in the mystique of Western military supremacy, but this book serves as a bracing antidote to that way of thinking.<br />The eve of the Greco-Persian Wars found Greece a hodgepodge of bickering and warring city-states, and Persia a monolithic, world-spanning empire capable of fabulous logistical and engineering feats. For example: an ancient \\"Suez Canal,\\" two pontoon bridges across the two mile breadth of the Hellespont, a supply line which kept an army of over 100,000 provisioned in enemy territory for over a year.<br />The Greeks on the other hand engaged in near-suicidal bickering and backstabbing, and when the crunch came, two small city-states (Athens and Sparta) fielded woefully inadequate armies and navies to face the Persian juggernaut. The rest, with few exceptions, either temporized or went over to the enemy.<br />Five great battles decided the fate of the Persians: Marathon, the twin battles of Thermopylae & Artemiseum, Salamis, and Plataea. Thermopylae was a glorious but devastating defeat, Artemiseum a draw, and the other three hairbreadth victories.<br />Green displays great scholarship but nonetheless makes his narrative a gripping read. He displays none of the stilted, lifeless prose of his predecessor A.R. Burn (\\"Persia and the Greeks\\") as he brings to life the epic struggle which gave birth to the West as we know it.

The Oracle pronounced that wooden walls would save Athens, but only the death of a Spartan king would save that unwalled city from ruin.<br />As the Persian juggernaut crossed over a two mile long pontoon bridge into Europe and began its relentless march into Greece, the Greeks temporized, argued, and dithered.  Finally, Sparta sent King Leonidas with three hundred Spartiates to hold the pass at Thermopylae against the Persian hordes.  Leonidas stiffened his contingent with Helots (Spartan serfs) and volunteers from several other Greek city-states.  Phocis, Thebes, Thespia, and a few others swelled Leonidas' ranks to a few thousand.<br />Upon being told that when the Persians loosed their arrows the sky went black, the Spartiate Dienekes rejoined \\"Then we shall fight in the shade.\\"  At a point in the pass no more than 20 yards wide Leonidas met the Persians and stopped them dead in their tracks.  For three days he and his men held the mightiest empire's mightiest army at bay, slaughtering the flower of the Persian army by the hundreds, if not thousands.  He might have held, but a traitorous Greek showed the Persians a mountain pass by which they could turn Leonidas' position.<br />Leonidas had guarded the pass with 1,000 Phocians, but the Persian \\"Immortals,\\" Xerxes' best unit, brushed them aside.  Upon learning of this treachery, Leonidas sent the other city-states' contingents home and prepared for his last stand.  The Thebans and Thespians volunteered to stay, and Leonidas chose for his battleground a wider section of the pass.  He wanted as wide a front as possible so he could kill as many Persians as possible.<br />The Spartans joined battle with the Persians for the last time, and the slaughter was horrific.  When, as anticipated, the Immortals took them in the rear, the Spartans retreated to a hillock, formed what the Middle Ages would call a \\"Swiss Hedgehog,\\" and died to the last man.<br />As prophecy foretold, the Spartans lost their king, but saved their city, and the rest of Greece with it.  The invasion continued apace, and Athens was sacked, with her entire population fleeing to the island of Salamis.  There in the straits between Salamis and Athens, the Greeks lured the Persian navy to its doom.<br />Winter was coming, and things hadn't quite worked out as expected.  Campaigning during the winter was verboten, and sustaining such a huge army in the field over the winter wasn't practicable.  Xerxes decided he had better get back to Susa, and took with him the remainder of his shattered navy and the bulk of his army.  He left his seasoned field commander, Mardonius, in charge of the best Persian contingents, expecting Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece during the next campaigning season.<br />Upon learning of Xerxes'withdrawal, the Spartans thought the war was over, and sent an embassy demanding satisfaction for the death of their king.  Xerxes laughed in their faces and told them that Mardonius would give them satisfaction next summer.  He did, but not as Xerxes expected.<br />Shakespeare once wrote \\"It is not within man's power to command success, but we shall do more--we shall deserve it.\\"  Leonidas and his 300 Spartiates could not command succes, but they did more, they deserved it.<br />Bradford puts the story of Leonidas in its proper place within the vast panorama of the Greco Persian Wars.

What little I'd seen of the TV Cadfael portrayed by Derek Jacobi had led me to believe Cadfael somewhat of a wimp.  I studiously avoided Cadfael both on TV and in print.  A long automobile trip and a dearth of listening material sent me to the audio section of a chain bookstore, and I happened on this audiobook detailing the origins of Brother Cadfael.  It didn't take long to find out how wrong I'd been about Cadfael.<br />Brother Cadfael is no Father Brown.  He is a robust, bear of a man whose spiritual strength matches his physical strength.  As a youth he went Crusading and broke heads in God's service.  As a mature man he took up another Cross and devoted himself to mending heads, again in God's service.  As devout as he is, however, he cannot refrain from meddling in the affairs of others.  His meddling takes the form of solving murder mysteries and other criminal conundra.<br />This collection of three short stories, however, is not the volume with which to begin your acquaintance with Cafael.  Begin your reading of Cadfael with &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones.&quot; It is not only the first story in the series, it is an excellent murder mystery.  It also gives the reader a pleasant window into the life of ordinary people in Medieval England.	2003-11-10

In a blindfold simul, the master plays several opponents without looking at any of the boards.  It is usually accomplished by the master sitting with his back to the array of boards.  In this exhibition, the master sat in a different room sipping cocoa while four messengers brought the moves to him from his twelve opponents.  One of the opponents actually played a counter gambit.<br />When the master keels over dead from arsenic poisoning, the club member who brought him the cocoa becomes the prime suspect.  Wolfe refuses to believe that the cocoa deliverer committed the murder because he will have to return the $22,000.00 retainer paid him by the suspect's daughter if the suspect actually proves to be guilty.<br />Wolfe decides that the only way the suspect could be innocent would be if one of the messengers had sacrificed the master as a gambit to incriminate the suspect.  But he lacks one essential fact to be able to prove his case.<br />Wolfe devises a gambit to get that fact, but someone sacrifices the witness who can give it to him.

The pastiche sketched out the bare essentials of the plot and named Guy Fawkes as the ringleader. After reading this slim volume, I now have the following information to add to what I learned from the radio play:<br />Guy Fawkes was not the ringleader, but a pawn--somewhat like the Watergate burglars. The ringleader was a Robert Catesby, and the conspirators were devout Catholics suffering repression and seeking to replace King James with a Catholic ruler. Repression of Catholicism redoubled after the plot was foiled. Robert Catesby and his cohorts hired Guy Fawkes, a mercenary with a talent for exploding things, to blow up King James and Parliament in one fell swoop. Fawkes was caught red handed under Parliament with a lantern and more than enough gunpowder to do the job. He was not advised of his Miranda rights before questioning.<br />\\"The Gunpowder Plot\\" is a great story poorly told. The writer assumes too much background knowledge on the part of the reader, and the writing is closer to James Joyce than Ernest Hemingway without displaying the literary talent of either. Whenever I decide I am reading a poorly written book, I usually put it down without finishing it. Despite its shortcomings, I finished \\"The Gunpowder Plot\\". The story itself was so interesting that it carried me through to the end.<br />Wading through to the end proved rewarding.

Edith Meiser dramatized almost every one of Doyle's original Sherlock Holmes stories (and a few hundred Holmes stories of her own invention) for American radio, and a few of them survive to this day.  Meiser could never bring herself to dramatize \\"The Final Problem.\\"  The classic radio Holmes, against which all other radio Holmes must be measured, is the Green/Boucher series of pastiches starring Nigel Bruce and Basil Rathbone. Radio drama died in America during the late `50's and early `60's, but it is still a staple of British radio over the BBC.  Holmes has had a long and varied career on BBC radio, being done and redone with various actors.<br />The present series of stories represents one of the two latest Holmes attempts on BBC.  The other is the Bert Coules series starring Clive Merrison and Michael Williams.  Coules' series reprises the entire corpus of Doyle's work (most of which is available from Amazon.com), including \\"The Final Problem.\\"  \\"Sherlock Holmes: Radio Mysteries\\" consists of pastiches.  The present work suffers in comparison with Coules'dramatizations, but compares very favorably with all other surviving radio renditions of Holmes.

What was thought to be his last appearance in print (\\"Rumpole and the Angel of Death\\") came in the 1990's when I was a relatively battle-scarred prosecutor.  Although Rumpole prosecuted only once during his long career, I always felt a kinship to this cigar smoking, poetry spouting barrister who loved his profession so passionately.  Through ten individual volumes (nine of which were collected into \\"Rumpole Omnibuses\\") and almost sixty stories, Rumpole strove mightily on behalf of the poor and oppressed, made pungent observations on the human condition and the trial of criminal cases, and drank gallons of cheap wine at Pomeroy's Wine Bar.<br />Rumpole's greatest charm came from his on-the-money observations about life of a journeyman trial lawyer.  Not as successful as he could have been, not as ambitious as he should have been, Rumpole proved an enigma to his fellow barristers and his wife, Hilda (\\"She Who Must Be Obeyed\\").<br />You can imagine my pleasure to discover that Mortimer had resurrected Rumpole for one more round of trials down at the Old Bailey.  All previous Rumpole opuses have been televised by the BBC (and later on PBS) with Leo McKern starring as Rumpole.  The shows have been every bit as good as the stories.  There will be no televising of these stories, however, as McKern passed away recently.  Mortimer wrote the Rumpole character for McKern, and no one else could ever portray Rumpole half as well.<br />Rumpole, however, is beginning to show his age.  Mortimer's stories are just as well written as in the previous stories, but it is apparent that Rumpole's abilities are beginning to wane.  He's not quite as sharp as he once was.  He's not quite as able to carry off his Machiavellian manipulations of his fellow lawyers as he once was, and his health is beginning to fail.  It was bittersweet to read these latest stories.  One must hope that if Mortimer writes any more Rumpole stories, that they will come from Rumpole's as-yet-unchronicled youth.

The resulting carnage was horrific. There was no maneuver, no strategy, and little room for skill at arms. Only strength, stamina, and courage mattered.<br />As bloody and unpleasant as the hoplite battle was, it was really a system designed to limit non-combatant casualties. Only the soldiers on the chosen field of battle exposed themselves to injury while the city-states themselves suffered little behind their stout walls. Hoplite warfare was sort of like settling international disputes by means of a very bloody football game.<br />The essays in this volume explore all aspects of the very bloody sport that was classical Greek combat. Arms, armament, drill, ritual, and all other appurtenances of Greek warfare are examined exhaustively. There is even a whole chapter devoted to the \\"salpinx,\\" the Greeks' version of the bugle.<br />The writing is somewhat uneven (some of the contributors seek to display their extensive vocabulary rather than enlighten the reader) and the work suffers greatly from a dearth of illustrations. Several chapters refer extensively to paintings on pottery, but the pottery isn't depicted in the book. Despite these shortcomings, I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in ancient military history.<br />If you'd like an overview that doesn't delve quite as deeply into the details of hoplite battle, you might prefer two other works: F.E. Adcock's \\"The Greek and Macedonian Art of War,\\" and Victor Hansen's \\"The Western Way of War,\\" both available from Amazon.com.	2002-08-20

He opposed the teaching of evolution because he saw it as casting doubt on God's creation and portraying man as little more than a clever animal.<br />When the legislation was being considered, he asked that it have no penalty provision. Upon the passage of the legislation, the ACLU, which had yet to win a civil rights case, offered to pay the legal expenses of any teacher brave enough to defy the law. Prominent civic leaders of an economically depressed backwater town prevailed upon a young teacher to stand trial for violating the law as a publicity stunt.<br />What resulted was one of the most farcical trials in the history of American jurisprudence. William Jennings Bryan, who had joined the prosecution team, offered to pay the defendant's fine if he was convicted. The defense wanted to lose so badly that they asked the jury to convict. The centerpiece of the defense was the \\"cross examination\\" of Bryan, one of the prosecutors. The resulting conviction led to a wave of anti-evolution legislation throughout the South.<br />Both sides had hoped that the trial would demonstrate the truth of their positions. As the fictional barrister, Horace Rumpole, once said, \\"A criminal trial is a pretty blunt instrument for prising out the truth.\\" Both sides wound up suffering devastating blows. Bryan, the champion of anti-evolution, came off looking like an idiot. Darrow, the \\"champion\\" of enlightenment, came off looking like a jerk. The Vanderbilt University humanist and champion of evolution, Edwin Mims, said \\"When Clarence Darrow is put forth as the champion of the forces of enlightenment to fight the battle for scientific knowledge, one feels almost persuaded to become a Fundamentalist.\\"<br />Larsen summed it up thus: \\"[T]he nation's press initially saw little of lasting significance in the trial beyond its having exposed Bryan's empty head and Darrow's mean spirit.\\" p. 202.<br />The vicious witchhunt of legend is thus exposed as nonsensical farce perpetrated by publicity hounds.

Three stories with three murders committed with blunt instruments.<br />\\"Black Orchids\\" seemingly departs from the norm.  There are only two stories, but each involves black orchids.<br />The first story, \\"Black Orchids,\\" has Wolfe leaving his brownstone.  Business doesn't bring him forth, it is envy.  There is a flower show at which a rival is showing rare black orchids.  Wolfe is green with envy.  He sends Archie to view them and report, but word-of-mouth proves insufficient.  Wolfe has to see them for himself.  While Wolfe is at the show, someone is murdered and the owner of the black orchids stands to be horribly embarrassed if not arrested.  Wolfe undertakes to rescue the owner for a small fee--the black orchids.  Of course, he pulls it off, otherwise he couldn't have sent black orchids to the funeral of the victim in the second mystery.<br />In \\"Cordially Invited to Meet Death,\\" a party arranger calls on Nero Wolfe, but contracts tetanus and dies before she can pay his fee. Relatives have a way of thinking that the most innocent of unexpected deaths are homicide, and one of the victim's relatives raises sand with the police trying to get them to investigate the case as a murder. Not getting satisfaction, he then retains Nero Wolfe. A little looksee into the circumstances of the death confirms the relative's suspicions.<br />The cast of suspects is limited, but figuring out whodunnit is a tough nut to crack. With Archie Goodwin's help, Wolfe sorts through the clues, confounds the police, and reveals the killer. Of course, Wolfe's too much of a homebody to go to the arranger's funeral, so he sends Archie in his place.  When Archie sees the spray of black orchids, he knows only one person in the whole wide world could have sent it.  Which leads us to the third mystery.  What prompted Wolfe to send those flowers?  Archie offers a few conjectures, but Wolfe is mum.  The reader is left to his own devices in solving this third mystery.Which leads us to the third mystery.

The 35 men responsible for the injury form a League of Atonement to help support their victim.  Eventually the victim discovers he has great literary ability and becomes a lionized author.  All his books have as their theme the murder of various characters modeled after various members of the League of Atonement.  The victim has become a Literary Avenger. Then one member dies violently at a reunion while in close proximity to the Literary Avenger.  The survivors receive an anonymous poem suggesting the Literary Avenger has become a literal avenger.  Another dies of poisoning shortly after a meeting with the Avenger.  Another group of poems goes out.  A third disappears without a trace.  Another anonymous poem goes out to the League.  They have transmogrified from the League of Atonement to the League of Frightened Men.<br />They consult with Nero Wolfe, and he undertakes to relieve their fears for an obscene fee.  Wolfe feels that all he needs is the answers to three questions and he can corkscrew a confession out of the Literary Avenger.  Before Wolfe can pull it off, his target gets himself arrested for the murder of a fourth member of the League, and it looks like an open and shut case.  Wolfe stands to lose his fee.  If the Avenger gets electrocuted for the fourth murder, the League won't owe him a cent.<br />Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's confidential assistant, sees the problem quite simply.  All Wolfe has to do is exonerate the Literary Avenger in the fourth murder and get confessions to the first three.  The pair of detectives travels a complex path to achieve Archie's simple solution.  Archie gets poisoned, Wolfe gets kidnapped, and it all culminates in one of the most Machiavellian maneuvers ever to spring from Wolfe's fertile imagination.	2002-07-27

Detective	Nero Wolfe is constantly getting himself into fixes through three character flaws.  Arrogance, Cupidity, and Eccentricity.  He must then shake off his indolence and use his intelligence to extricate himself from whatever predicament he stumbles into.  Frequently he must extricate himself through the device of an elaborate caper designed to expose a killer while simultaneously burying his embarrassment.<br />Each of the four stories in this book has as its centerpiece an elaborate caper.  In two of the stories Wolfe engineers a caper to extricate himself from danger; in the one the caper places him in danger; in the fourth, he is victimized by a caper and solves the mystery through sheer force of logic and deduction.<br />In \\"Christmas Party\\" Wolfe's fear that Archie is going to marry causes him to masquerade as Santa Claus and become prime suspect in a murder.  In \\"Easter Parade\\" Wolfe's envy of a rival orchid grower causes him to stoop to petit theft and become embroiled in a murder mystery.  In \\"Fourth of July Picnic\\" Wolfe discovers a murder at a picnic, attempts to flee without reporting it, and must expose the murderer before he himself gets arrested for obstructing justice.  In \\"Murder is No Joke\\" Wolfe provides all the usual suspects with an ironclad alibi.  How can he break an alibi that he himself provides?<br />Classic murder mysteries rarely bear any resemblance to reality.  I've handled hundreds of homicide cases over the years, and the puzzles presented by real life homicide investigations bear no resemblance whatsoever to the puzzles presented in murder mysteries.  You can imagine my pleasure on finding that Wolfe solved one of the mysteries in this book with exactly the same stratagem employed in a case that I prosecuted years ago.  I've long since lost track of the investigator who solved that little mystery, but if I ever see him again, I'm certainly going to ask him if he has ever read any Nero Wolfe.	2002-07-20

Supplementi) (Italian Edition)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Cicero's Maiden Voyage in the Sea of Persuasion	When he wrote &quot;De Inventione,&quot; Cicero was about 19 years old, fresh out of what passed for law school in those days, and at the beginning of his career.  He intended to write five books on the five departments of rhetoric (Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery), but he never got past the first volume on invention.  He wrote well, and his prose entertains, but he depended heavily on the works of others.  &quot;De Inventione&quot; bears such resemblance to the anonymous work, &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot; that later generations attributed that work to Cicero as well.  Both works were indebted to the Greek textbooks on rhetoric and particularly to the teaching of Hermagoras.<br />By the time he wrote &quot;De Oratore&quot; near the end of his career, Cicero was a mature veteran of many courtroom encounters, and he had become somewhat ashamed of &quot;De Inventione.&quot;  He shouldn't have been.  Although &quot;De Oratore&quot; reveals him to be a master trial lawyer whose deep understanding of human persuasion was augmented by years of experience, his earlier work reveals him to be a talented rookie who had a good academic knowledge of rhetoric.<br />The basic theory expounded in &quot;De Inventione&quot; remains in &quot;De Oratore,&quot; but the seasoning he acquired from decades as an advocate makes &quot;De Oratore&quot; a much more polished exposition of the praxis of rhetoric.  If you only have time to read one book, read &quot;De Oratore,&quot; but if you want to plumb the depths of Cicero's mind on the subject of rhetoric, read both.  If you read both, you can follow Cicero as he matures from callow but talented tyro to the greatest advocate of his age.	2002-07-19

He takes the \\"Agatha Christie-esque\\" drawing room mystery and sets \\"Dashiel Hammet-ish\\" detectives to solve it. This mystery is prototypical Nero Wolfe. An heiress dies of ptomaine poisoning and her disinherited brother summons Archie Goodwin (a Sam Spade/Philip Marlowe clone) to the mansion to find the killer among the sycophants of the fabulously wealthy wheelchair-bound widower. The brother dies violently in the house, and Archie Goodwin tricks Nero Wolfe (a sort of cross between Mycroft Holmes and the Continental Op) into coming to the mansion to solve the mystery. Wolfe quickly solves it in true Mycroftian fashion, but has to commit a felony to smoke out the murderer.	2002-07-12

The Guernsey League is scandalized and tries to buy the bull back, but Pratt is obdurate.  Nero Wolfe and his confidential assistant Archie Goodwin, on their way to an orchid show, crash (literally) the party in time to witness an idiotic bet made between Pratt and Clyde Osgood, the eldest son of Pratt's longtime rival.  Soon thereafter, Archie is set to guard the bull against mischief.  The bull isn't harmed under Archie's watchful eye, but he becomes distracted by the beautiful Lily Rowan and the next thing he knows, he finds the bull, with bloody horns, worrying Clyde Osgood's gored-to-death body.  Wolfe gets hired to investigate the death, anthrax breaks out, a guest of Osgood's gets pitchforked, Archie gets arrested on suspicion of murder, and Wolfe (who solved the murder before anyone else knew it was a murder) slothfully allows all his evidence to go up in smoke.  Funny and fast-paced, this story is the closest thing to a fair-play mystery that I have ever read in the Nero Wolfe corpus.  If you grew up on a farm as I did, you stand a fair chance of figuring out who done it and how done it before Wolfe wins first place at the orchid show and eats his last fricassee at the Methodist women's food concession.  The real trick in this one is how to prove it.  Wolfe shakes off his indolence, springs Archie from jail, and engineers an elaborate caper designed to bring the killer to justice.	2002-07-11

In \\"Before I Die\\" a crime boss brings a blackmail case to Wolfe, never expecting to die.  But just in case, he makes Wolfe the executor of his estate, thereby making Wolfe and Archie Goodwin the prime suspects in his murder.  Wolfe's task: solve the crime boss's murder before he and Archie are erased by the boss's vengeful hit man.  In \\"Help Wanted--Male\\" Wolfe blows off a prospective client who has received a death threat mere hours before the man's brutal murder.  Then Wolfe receives an identical death threat.  Wolfe is as concerned about the threat against himself as he was unconcerned about the threat against his prospective client.  He goes to remarkable lengths to preserve his skin, makes the biggest blunder of his career, and discovers his mistake just in time by inspecting furniture.  \\"Instead of Evidence\\" presents a situation where a prospective victim hires Wolfe for $5,000.00 to avenge his impending murder by his business partner.  When the man dies horribly, Wolfe has a ready-made suspect but a paucity of evidence.  It looks as though the killer will go unpunished, but at the last minute Wolfe gets the picture.  At least two of these stories (\\"Before I Die\\" and \\"Help Wanted--Male\\") have been televised on the A&E series \\"Nero Wolfe\\" (long may it run).	2002-07-11

It's hard to say which way gives the most pleasure.  As much as I like the A&E shows, and as much as I like Durkin Hayes' editions of the CBC radio shows, I think the best way to enjoy Nero Wolfe is in print.  And the best way to enjoy him in print is in Rex Stout's novelettes.  The novels are good, but the novelettes are tauter, faster-paced, and funnier.  \\"Three Witnesses\\" serves up three very good novelettes.  In \\"The Next Witness\\" Wolfe sits uncomfortably in a crowded courtroom, under subpoena, and waiting to give truthful testimony which he expects will materially contribute to the conviction for murder of an innocent man.  What to do, what to do?  Flee the courtroom, dodge the arrest warrant issued for contempt of court, and bring the real murderer to justice before the judge can bang his gavel down on a sentence of imprisonment for contempt.  That sounds easy enough, doesn't it?  In \\"When a Man Murders\\", a millionaire returns from the dead to retrieve the fortune which was divided among his heirs and reclaim the \\"widow\\" who has entered into a much happier second marriage.  The \\"widow\\" comes to Wolfe for his assistance in obtaining a divorce from her recently resurrected spouse.  Not to worry, he almost immediately dies again, but the widow's new husband is arrested for murder.  Wolfe must penetrate a web of lies to determine who among the heirs had the most to gain from the millionaire's second death.  In \\"Die Like a Dog\\" an improbable chain of coincidences brings Nero Wolfe together with Nero the Labrador Retriever.  Together they unravel a murder mystery, reunite a couple, and retrieve Archie Goodwin's raincoat.  \\"Die Like a Dog\\" and \\"The Next Witness\\" have both been televised on the A&E series.	2002-07-11

Wolfe has a few dollars given him by the boy.  He determines to spend the money, but no more, seeking the boy's slayer.  His efforts bring him another person in need, who gives Wolfe a check for $10,000.00 to help her in a certain matter.  She refuses to elucidate exactly what she wants, but says she will explain after making a few inquiries on her own.  She also dies violently.<br />Wolfe doesn't really know what the woman wanted him to do to earn his money, but he decides that she would not be displeased if he used it to solve her murder.  He is immediately beset by lawyers seeking the return of the money to the woman's estate.<br />Wolfe fends off the lawyers and Inspector Cramer as he tries to solve the murders with almost nothing to go on.  He does have a similarly executed third murder to consider, a pair of golden spider earrings, and a half-dozen or so unlovely suspects.  He makes an assumption, acts on it, \\"stirs things up\\" a little, almost gets his confidential assistant Archie Goodwin arrested, gets his ace operative Saul Panzer blackmailed, and gets his operative Fred Durkin tortured.  Wolfe's brain can concoct the most Byzantine situations, but Archie's brawn must oftentimes carry them through to fruition.  As Fred undergoes torture, Archie steps in and saves the day by delivering a performance worthy of Clint Eastwood's \\"Dirty Harry.\\"<br />With Archie's help, Wolfe uncovers a scandal, hands a gang of thugs over to Inspector Cramer, and earns his fee by not only solving the woman's murder but also clearing up the matter she wanted him to handle in the first place.  All good fun, and one of the more action-oriented of the Nero Wolfe stories.	2002-06-23

This book is based on a series of lectures delivered by Bury at Cambridge University.  He begins with a description of German life in the forests outside the Empire and then tells how population pressures and migrations eventually ruptured the border of the Roman Empire, letting in tribe after tribe of German warriors.<br />They came as federates, seldom thinking of themselves as conquerors, seeking to partake of the goodness of Roman civilization, not destroy it.  Seen in this light, the Western Empire didn't so much fall as fade away under the successive waves of migrating tribes.<br />Most history books date the fall of the Western Empire from the date on which Odovacer deposed the last Western Emperor, Romulus Augustulus.  Bury makes the point that Odovacer and his successors, the Ostrogoths, recognized the authority of the Eastern Emperor.  It wasn't until the Lombard invasion that a completely independent German state was set up in Italy.<br />My misconception always was that the Germans were pagan invaders. The major tribes of the invasion were all Christians.  They weren't Catholic, they subscribed to the heretical doctrine of Arianism.  Bury makes a compelling case that the Ostrogothic kingdom's short existence was caused by the fact that Italy was largely Catholic and hostile to their heretical overlords.<br />It is interesting that the first lasting Germanic kingdom was established by the Frankish king, Clovis, who converted to Catholicism.  Bury makes the case that Clovis converted to Catholicism, not because of a battlefield prayer for victory and a sign from heaven, but because of a calculated decision of statecraft by a shrewd politician.  Clovis correctly discerned that his rule would be more lasting if he adopted the religion of most of his subjects.<br />A compelling chronicle of a turbulent time peopled with remarkable protagonists.

He must walk a fine line between legitimate investigation and obstruction of justice in order to exonerate his client.<br />In \\"Counterfeit for Murder,\\" Archie thinks it will be great fun to try to induce Wolfe to act for a homely old landlady who has a bagful of funny money.  When  the landlady's beautiful tenant is found dead and the landlady is arrested, Wolfe must fend off Inspector Cramer and the Secret Service as he tries to free his homely client and find the real killer.  I must admit that when I read a Nero Wolfe mystery, I'm usually in the dark until Wolfe unveils the killer.  In this one, the killer is obvious to the careful reader.	2002-02-19

Looms were the typed up notes of the students who made the highest grades in each of the classes.  Looms were clear, concise statements of the essentials of a course without all the extraneous verbiage that creeps into didactic presentation.<br />&quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot; reads like a loom.  It states its points in clear, concise language without elaboration.  The points are well made and highly relevant to the subject of persuasive oratory.<br />You might well describe &quot;Rhetorica&quot; as an ancient handbook on the subject of arguing a criminal case to a jury.  At some trial advocacy school I attended sometime during my career as a lawyer, I learned a basic outline for delivering a final argument.  You can imagine my amusement when I learned that this basic outline came from a 2,000 year old book.  That isn't the only part of the book applicable to the modern courtroom.<br />The ancient rhetorician was to be skilled in five areas:  1. Invention:  Deciding what to say.  2. Arrangment:  Deciding what order to say it in.  3.  Style:  Saying it well.  4. Memory: Remembering what to say.  5.  Delivery:  The nonverbals that accompany speech.<br />&quot;Rhetorica&quot; consists of four books arranged as follows:<br />Books I &amp; II cover Invention, especially as it relates to Judicial or Forensic Rhetoric, giving an analysis as timely as an article from last week's law journal.  Although the technology of rhetoric has changed markedly since the days of Cicero, the general principles of rhetoric haven't changed much at all.<br />Book III takes up Ceremonial and Deliberative Rhetoric and also deals with Arrangement, Delivery, and Memory.<br />Book IV, which proves the most tedious, deals with Style.	2002-02-09

They plan to marry.  He is black, she is white.  Today this would present no great problem. In 1964, such a marriage was unlawful in many states and unthinkable in most of the others.  The young man's father employs Nero Wolfe to \\"dig up some dirt\\" on the girl so that he can use it to talk his son out of \\"ruining his life.\\"<br />While Wolfe plays muckraker the girl gets herself killed and her fiance discovers her body.  In the wake of the discovery he manages to act guilty enough to get himself arrested.  Despite the incriminating circumstantial evidence, his innocence is obvious to everyone except the police.<br />Wolfe undertakes to find the real killer, and discovers that almost every single member of the civil rights group had motive, means, and opportunity to kill the girl.  One of the group even volunteers to confess to the murder to save the young man.<br />Wolfe keeps Archie and Saul Panzer hopping as they run down leads and try to sort through the tangle of evidence, and of course they come out the other side of the maze with a surprising and satisfying solution.	2002-02-09

It has the connotation of artful trickery and deception.  No matter what you may think of rhetoric, you engage in it each and every time you try to prevail upon someone to see things your way.  Rhetoric is the art of persuasion.  Any artform practiced by mortals can be (and is) misused by unscrupulous villains.  Those who decry rhetoric for its susceptibility to misuse overlook this point:  Rhetoric, properly understood and applied, is the best defense against misused rhetoric.<br />For a good grounding in the basics of rhetoric, the student need look no farther than this textbook.  It is not easy reading, but diligent study will equip the reader well for the tasks of analyzing, defending, and making arguments.  The book aims at the written word, but the principles apply as well to the spoken.<br />The book divides itself into six chapters:<br />1.  Introduction<br />2.  Discovery of Arguments (Deciding what to say).<br />3.  Arrangement of Material (Marshalling your arguments for greatest effect).<br />4.  Style (How best to speak/write your arguments).<br />5.

Barnum who said \\"You'll never go broke underestimating the public.\\"  Barnum was speaking hyperbolically (I hope), but it is true that many otherwise intelligent people will fall prey to the most outlandish fraud and manipulation.  In addition to protecting the reader against conmen, this little book will serve as an antidote to fuzzy thinking in general.<br />\\"Thinking\\" is set up like a dictionary, with alphabetical entries and boldfaced cross references.  This arrangement makes the work somewhat user-unfriendly.  You can't analyze an argument by looking it up in the book.  You won't know what entry to look under.  Reading the book straight through from A to Z makes the presentation somewhat disjointed because related ideas are scattered throughout the book depending on what letter of the alphabet they begin with.<br />A good way to attack the book is to start at A and read the entries in alphabetical order, stopping to look up and read each cross reference as you come to it.  Thus you'd read \\"Absurd consequences move\\" first, and then skip to \\"reductio ad absurdum,\\" \\"refutation,\\" and the other terms cross referenced in the entry.  Then you'd read the next alphabetical entry and all its cross references, and so on until you come to the end of the book.  If you follow this procedure with each alphabetical entry, re-reading every term each time it is cross referenced, by the time you get to \\"Zig-zagging,\\" you will have a good handle on all types of logical and illogical arguments.  You'll also be able to analytically dissect advertisements, newscasts, op-ed pieces, and political speeches.<br />\\"Thinking,\\" gives an excellent grounding in rhetorical analysis that will serve you well the next time someone tries to pull the wool over your eyes.	2002-01-26

Each name is individually entered, but only the main name is defined.  Each of the lesser names simply has cross references.  The merely-cross-referenced names outnumber the actually-defined names by about 3 to 1.  The actually-defined names should have been set in a bolder type than the merely-cross-referenced names.<br />Chapter 2 consists of an excellent review of the divisions of rhetoric.  Read Chapter 2 first.<br />Chapter 3 takes the more common rhetorical devices and catalogs them by type, giving brief definitions.  It catalogs only one name for each device, and is much more user friendly than Chapter 1.  Read Chapter 3 second.<br />My suggestion for the third edition:  Reorder the chapters. Put Chapter 2 first and Chapter 1 last.	2002-01-26

Dangerous to the owner, that is. We all, at one time or another, have great difficulty climbing out of holes that we have dug with our tongue.<br />Thompson teaches a method for using the tongue as a constructive, rather than a destructive force. He sets out some simple mnemonics to guide the reader through the thorny thicket of verbal confrontation, and gives the reader a good concept of how to work toward a win/win solution.<br />Thompson's definition of win/win is this: You get what you want, your antagonists saves face, and nobody gets hurt. The principles are easily grasped, the methods are simple and straightforward, and the objectives are praiseworthy.<br />The philosophy of Verbal Judo is summed up in a quotation from Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\": \\"To win 100 battles is not excellence; to win without fighting is excellence.\\"	2002-01-19

John Thomas Scopes	Books	4	2	3	N	N	The Agnostic -vs- the Know Nothing	In his preface to this book, Irving Younger applauds Darrow's systematic annihilation of poor, befuddled Bryan.  \\"Analysis of this kind of drama is irrelevant.  One can only smile, admire, and wonder,\\" he says.  Although Younger declined to analyze Darrow's examination of Bryan, the contemporary press (most of whom staunchly supported teaching evolution) were not so reticent to judge.  Edward J. Larsen, in the Pultizer Prize winning history of the trial, \\"Summer for the Gods,\\" summed it up thus: \\"[T]he nation's press initially saw little of lasting significance in the trial [whose centerpiece was Darrow's examination of Bryan] beyond its having exposed Bryan's empty head and Darrow's mean spirit.\\" p. 202.<br />Some quotes from contemporary sources found on page 207 of Larsen's book:  Walter Lippman of the \\"New York World\\":  \\"Now that the chuckling and giggling over the heckling of Bryan by Darrow has subsided it is dawning upon the friends of evolution that science was rendered a wretched service by that exhibition.\\"  The New Orleans \\"Times Picayune\\":  \\"Mr. Darrow, with his sneering 'I object to prayer!' and with his ill-natured and arrogant cross-examination of Bryan on the witness stand, has done more to stimulate 'anti-evolution' legislation in the United States than Mr. Bryan and his fellow literalists, left alone, could have hoped for.\\"  The Vanderbilt University humanist and champion of evolution, Edwin Mims:  \\"When Clarence Darrow is put forth as the champion of the forces of enlightenment to fight the battle for scientific knowledge, one feels almost persuaded to become a Fundamentalist.\\"<br />As Larsen explains in \\"Summer for the Gods,\\" Darrow's examination assumed the status of a legendary victory only after the release of the McCarthy-era morality play \\"Inherit the Wind,\\" which took great dramatic license in depicting the examination as having \\"won\\" the Scopes Trial.<br />When a lawyer performs as mean-spirited an examination as Darrow did of Bryan, the lawyer's rabid fans are enthralled, his enemies are enraged, and those on the fence are encouraged to join the enemy.  Darrow's examination of Bryan should be studied as a fine example of how not to perform a cross examination.lawyer's rabid fans are enthralled, his enemies are enraged, and those on the fence are encouraged to join the enemy.

Earthlings had gone to the stars and met with a powerful empire under Central Control. Earthlings being too backward for anything else, they were allowed into the empire as mercenaries.  &quot;Star Guard&quot; follows the adventures of a unit of mercenaries sent to serve a usurper on a backwater world.  Their boss loses and they have to fight their way to freedom across a hostile world.  I read and re-read the story several times, and I still have the old thirty five cent Ace paperback lovingly tucked away on a shelf in my library.  &quot;Star Guard&quot; forms half of the book &quot;Star Soldiers.&quot;<br />The other half comes from another novel I read multiple times as a preteenager--&quot;Star Rangers.&quot;  This book also found its inspiration in a historical incident (or at least a historical legend).  During the decline of Rome an Emperor decided to rid himself of a pesky legion.  He ordered them to march east; they obeyed; and they marched right off the pages of history.  Some 6,000 years after that Emperor's edict, it is repeated by another crumbling civilization.  Central Control is losing its grip on its far flung galactic empire.  The Star Rangers are somewhat of a nuisance to Central Control, so it sends them off on a fool's errand of exploration.  &quot;Star Rangers&quot; chronicles the history of this last mission.<br />The Central Control of &quot;Star Guard&quot; was very similar to the Central Control of &quot;Star Rangers,&quot; but try as I might, I could never reconcile the dissimilarities enough to say that &quot;Star Guard&quot; and &quot;Star Rangers&quot; both occurred in the same fantasy universe.<br />The two stories are aimed at juveniles, their &quot;science&quot; is bankrupt, and they are little more than space opera.  But they entertain, and that is all that they were intended to do.hat is all that they were intended to do.	2002-01-12

That assessment began to change recently when I audited a continuing legal education seminar in which the speaker analyzed trial advocacy on the model of Aristotle's &quot;Rhetoric.&quot;  His speech was brief and his analysis superficial, but he'd aroused my curiosity.  I got this book and read it.<br />The general principles Aristotle formulated for forensic rhetoric over 2,000 years ago still hold true in the 21st century courtroom.  Some of the specifics have changed (e.g. no torture for slave witnesses), but human nature hasn't, and human persuasion hasn't, either.  Aristotle's &quot;Rhetoric&quot; should be required reading for all first year law students.  I regret not reading it 30 years ago.

The stories tend to be somewhat contrived and suffer in comparison to the BBC productions of original Doyle stories in which Clive Merrison starred as Holmes. The organ music gets monotonous, and if I weren't already a teetotaler, the wine commercials would make me take the temperance pledge. Despite all that, the productions are wonderful. The chemistry between Bruce and Rathbone is perfect, and the simple stories move swiftly to their satisfying (if sometimes obvious) conclusions. Although Holmes purists tend to hate Nigel Bruce's Watson, I found him to be irresistably likeable. I'd want Doyle's Watson guarding my back in a tight spot, but I'd rather sit by the fireplace and swap stories with Bruce's Watson. I particularly liked the host's introductory visits with Watson in which Watson sets the stage for the mysteries.<br />Simon &amp; Schuster originally published these plays as single cassettes.  Later they collected the plays into six &quot;gift sets&quot; containing four cassettes and eight plays each.  This collection contains all the stories from the first three volumes of the &quot;gift sets&quot; and the first two stories from the fourth volume.<br />So the potential purchaser won't fall into the mistake of buying duplicate stories, here is a list of all the stories along with my individual ratings:  (&quot;Conanical&quot; stories are based on actual Conan Doyle plots.

He recounts hardship, cameraderie, and combat in an engaging, almost lyrical, fashion.  I came away from &quot;Helmet&quot; with a renewed respect for the sacrifice of the Greatest Generation.  Uncommon valor was truly a common virtue.  Leckie's story will make any 18 year old want to march down to the recruiting station and sign up.<br />Leckie's story dovetails quite nicely with another memoir, &quot;With the Old Breed at Peliliu and Okinawa,&quot; the account of another First Division rifleman, E.B. Sledge.  The First Marine Division's WWII career began in the jungles of Guadalcanal, went through New Britain and on to Peliliu and ended at Okinawa.  Leckie was in at the beginning, but his combat career ended when he was wounded in the Hell of Peliliu.  Sledge's combat career began at Peliliu and ended on Okinawa.  Together the two give you an enlisted man's eye view of all the First Division's campaigns.<br />Sledge doesn't turn a phrase as well as Leckie, but his description of combat will make your blood run cold in a way that &quot;Helmet&quot; does not.  Any 18 year old reading &quot;Old Breed&quot; will want to tear up his enlistment papers.  It seems odd that Leckie, obviously the more accomplished wordsmith, does not paint as horrific a picture of combat as Sledge.  Could it be that Leckie has shied away from revealing the full extent of the hardship of combat?  Or could it be that Peliliu and Okinawa served up privation and hardship on a much grander scale than Guadalcanal and New Britain?  Read both books and decide for yourself.  For all its stark description, &quot;Old Breed&quot; will engender the same kind of respect for the men of the First Division that the reader takes away from &quot;Helmet.&quot;	2001-10-27

Mannix takes historical events and relates them in &quot;documentary&quot; fashion, but unabashedly invents details and descriptions which, if they are accurate, are accurate only by accident.<br /><br />If you understand from the outset what you are dealing with, &quot;The Way of the Gladiator&quot; can be great reading.

Beam Piper was obsessed with reincarnation, time travel, and alternate worlds.  He capitalized on that obsession by writing the Paratime stories, a loosely knit series of novelettes.  Verkan Vall, of the Paratime Police, served as the central character of most of the Paratime stories, and he made a capable, likeable hero.<br />The best of the Paratime stories centered around another hero, Cpl. Calvin Morrison of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Morrison figured in three short stories, &quot;Gunpowder God,&quot; &quot;Down Styphon,&quot; and a third unpublished story.  The three were posthumously conjoined to form the novella &quot;Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen.&quot;<br />The stories in which Cpl. Morrison takes no part were collected in &quot;Paratime.&quot;  The present book contains both &quot;Paratime&quot; and &quot;Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen.&quot;  It also contains a very interesting prologue in which John F. Carr discusses Piper's ideas on time travel, alternate worlds, and reincarnation.  He offers Piper's firm belief in reincarnation as a possible explanation for Piper's suicide.	2001-10-10

In these dreams he relives the pre-stoneage life of one of his proto-human ancestors.  Each night is a different episode from his ancestor's life, and the episodes are lived and relived in a jumbled, non-chronological order.  The narrator places the episodes in chronological order and tells his ancestor's biography.  What emerges is an action-packed, engaging saga of adventure and romance at the dawn of humanity.<br />London got the science of genetics wrong as he tried to explain how the narrator could have such memories, but he seems to have gotten one thing right.  Modern paleo-anthropology posits that for most of prehistory, the earth contained several coexisting species of hominids.  London peoples his world with three hominid species. His description of the interaction between these species probably gives an accurate depiction of ancient man's inter-species interaction.	2001-10-09

He accomplishes his purpose by introducing an historical figure (Ibn Faladan) into the story as narrator.  A real life Arab joins forces with a mythological Viking to do battle against the hypothetical prototypes of legendary monsters.  How's that again? Oddly enough, the story works.  Not quite as well as it could have, but the plot sweeps you along to Beowulf's foreordained glorious death.<br />Contrary to his source, Crichton makes Beowulf one of the Rus (the Viking invaders of Dark Ages Russia).  He has to do this to get Beowulf together with Ibn Faladan, who traveled in Russia a century or two after Beowulf's death.  You can't really complain about Crichton's disrespect for his sources.  After all, this IS a work of fiction.	2001-09-27

They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves.  They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance.  These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo.  Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.<br />Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers:  Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.<br />The company travels through strange lands, confronts awful perils, makes exotic friends, and all the while battles the evil influence of Sauron, the Dark Lord.  Eventually they become separated and undertake individual quests.  They perform mighty deeds, endure privation, suffer grievous wounds, and some of them even die, but finally the survivors reunite at a battle before the very gates of the Evil Empire.  The battle is not an Armageddon, with a fore-ordained winner.  It is a Ragnarok whose outcome cannot be known.  Writers have often imitated, but never equaled, Tolkien's adult fairy tale.<br />Although I'm not 100% sure, I believe the  Soundelux production differs from the BBC production of LOTR.  The production values and acting quality suffer by comparison with the BBC production of &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;  To say that production values are only adequate is no condemnation.  A great story can survive even a poor telling, and this production of LOTR is NOT a poor telling of the story.  One strong recommendation for the Soundelux edition:  the producers edited out almost all the songs and poems which add such tedium to the print version of LOTR.at story can survive even a poor telling, and this production of LOTR is NOT a poor telling of the story.

Compare Rambo to Egil Skallagrimson and prepare to be enlightened. Egil was an ugly, irascible, Herculean figure who would truly deserve the Biblical appellation &quot;mighty man of valor&quot; if it weren't for the persistent rumors that he was descended from Trolls.  He may have been a flawed man, but he was nevertheless a man.<br />Egil lived hard, fought lustily, and sinned mightily, but he was also capable of great virtue.  He was also an accomplished poet, and could improvise verse appropriate to almost any situation.<br />&quot;Egil's Saga&quot; provides a wonderful window into the harsh world of the Vikings, and it does so by telling the story of four generations of Viking chieftans.  We begin with Kveldulf, then take up the story of his son, Skallagrim, and then tell Egil's story.  Egil is, of course, the most remarkable man of his line.  Given Egil's tumultuous life, it is a wonder that he died of old age.  His son Thorstein becomes a farmer and a Christian, but the teachings of the Prince of Peace don't prevent Thorstein's son Skuli from embarking on pillaging expeditions.	2001-09-26

They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves. They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance. These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo. Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.<br />Frodo exits his homeland pursued by Furies: Nine undead kings mounted upon great black stallions. These Dark Riders have supernatural power and homicidal intent: they will find and destroy Frodo and restore the ring to its &quot;rightful&quot; owner, Sauron the Dark Lord.<br />Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers: Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.<br />The company meets exotic friends, confronts implacable foes, and surmounts daunting obstacles to move Frodo closer to accomplishing his important mission. This first volume of the trilogy ends with the quest seemingly in shambles, but remember there are two more volumes to come.<br />Many have imitated, but none have equaled Tolkien's fairy tale for adults. I wish, however, that he'd left out most of those songs and poems. The best poems were merely mediocre, while the worst were awful. Early on I started skipping the poetry whenever I came to it.

He's the prototype for Clint Eastwood's &quot;man with no name,&quot; Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, and dozens of other &quot;hard boiled&quot; detectives.  The difference between the Op and his imitators comes in Hammett's hands-on familiarity with his subject matter.  Hammett worked for a time as an operative for the Pinkerton Detective Agency, and he puts his knowledge of the seamier side of human nature to good use in crafting the stories about the Continental Op.<br />The Op has no existence, no identity whatsoever, outside his job.  He's not above a little &quot;necessary brutality,&quot; and he doesn't mind &quot;fudging the facts&quot; to see to it that justice as he understands it is done.  He has a slightly lopsided code of ethics and a totally jaundiced view of human nature, but he is dedicated to doing his job and doing it well.

Seeking a trip down nostalgia lane, I got the collection, and I wasn't disappointed.<br />The shows easily divide into three types:  Westerns from anthology series, &quot;adult&quot; Westerns, and &quot;juvenile&quot; Westerns.  Of the three, the Westerns drawn from anthology series were uniformly the best.  The anthology series represented in the collection were:  &quot;The Cavalcade of America,&quot; &quot;Escape,&quot; &quot;The Screen Director's Playhouse,&quot; and &quot;Suspense.&quot;  The only sour note among the anthology plays was &quot;Paleface&quot; from &quot;Screen Director's Playhouse.&quot;  A Bob Hope comedy was hopelessly out of place among all those Westerns.<br />The &quot;adult&quot; Westerns included &quot;Dr. Sixgun,&quot; &quot;Fort Laramie,&quot; &quot;Frontier Gentleman,&quot; &quot;Gunsmoke,&quot; &quot;Have Gun Will Travel,&quot; &quot;Hawk Larabee,&quot; &quot;Luke Slaughter of Tombstone,&quot; &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers,&quot; and &quot;The Six Shooter.&quot; &quot;Luke Slaughter&quot; seems to have been a cross between the rougher elements of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood with a little Ward Bond thrown in.  &quot;Hawk Larabee&quot; had more Western cliche's than &quot;Blazing Saddles,&quot; and I thought it was a rather sophisticated juvenile Western, but the enclosed booklet said it was aimed at adults.  The best of the lot seemed to me to be &quot;The Six Shooter,&quot; starring Jimmy Stewart.  &quot;Have Gun Will Travel&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; had quality in keeping with their TV counterparts. &quot;Frontier Gentleman&quot; starring John Dehner told of the life of a British journalist traveling the wild and woolly West.<br />I included &quot;Fort Laramie&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers&quot; in the adult Western category, but they actually belong in separate genres.  &quot;Fort Laramie&quot; (starring Raymond Burr) was a very good offering in the sub-genre of Cavalry stories.  Three other Cavalry stories came from anthology series: &quot;They Died with their Boots On&quot; (&quot;Cavalcade&quot;), &quot;Command&quot; (&quot;Escape&quot;), and &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (&quot;Screen Director's Playhouse&quot;).  &quot;They Died with their Boots On&quot; gave a glamorized account of George Armstrong Custer, a seriously flawed military figure.  &quot;Command&quot; provided a good character study of a young officer's first encounter with combat.  &quot;Fort Apache&quot; did an excellent job of distilling the feature length movie into a 30 minute format.<br />&quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers&quot; turned in stories that were realistic, plots that were well crafted, and a hero who was both admirable and believable.  But it isn't a Western.  It's a true crime  detective series set in mid 20th Century Texas. It fits better in &quot;Old Time Radio's Greatest Detectives.&quot; As a matter of fact &quot;Greatest Detectives&quot; also contains a &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; cassette.  &quot;Tales of Texas Rangers,&quot; in my opinion, is radio's greatest true crime series.  Better than &quot;Dragnet,&quot; &quot;Gangbusters,&quot; &quot;Crime Classics,&quot; and anything else.  Its closest competitor is &quot;The Black Museum,&quot; tales about London's Scotland Yard.  The fact that &quot;Greatest Westerns&quot; contained three &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers&quot; episodes was a major contributing factor in my decision to buy the collection.<br />The juvenile Westerns were &quot;The Cisco Kid,&quot; &quot;Hopalong Cassidy,&quot; &quot;The Lone Ranger,&quot; &quot;Red Ryder,&quot; &quot;Roy Rogers,&quot; &quot;Straight Arrow,&quot; and &quot;Wild Bill Hickock.&quot;  &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and &quot;Roy Rogers&quot; were, well, juvenile.  &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; was a little better, but not much.  &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; was my childhood idol, but he's overly preachy and that maskwas completely unnecessary.  One show in particular disturbed me.  It is an account of how the Lone Ranger subverted the democratic process by stealing an election ballot box.  He had good intentions, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.  I'm not a proponent of Machiavelli's motto that the end justifies the means.  &quot;Wild Bill Hickock&quot; (with Andy Devine as Jingles providing comic relief) was the most enjoyable of the juveniles, but the plots were a little thin.  &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; has to be the best of the juveniles.  The plots were detective stories transplanted to the Old West.  &quot;Straight Arrow&quot; edged out &quot;Red Ryder&quot; for the dumbest show.  &quot;Straight Arrow&quot; is a super hero disguised as a Comanchee warrior.

Sherlock Holmes stands as the greatest detective in the history of the medium of print. Lt. Columbo has to be recognized as the greatest detective ever created for TV. Johnny Dollar is the greatest detective ever created for radio. He began his career as a shady free-lance insurance investigator notorious for padding his expense account. Each episode is wrapped around Dollar's filling out his expense voucher. Had he remained a slightly sleazy sleuth, he would deserve the oblivion into which he has sunk. But he didn't and he doesn't. He became a respectable, stand-up kind of a guy, gritty and determined, and tenacious in the pursuit of his assignment. Several actors portrayed Johnny Dollar in the weekly half hour episodes, but Bob Bailey stands head and shoulders above the rest. For a brief period of time during Bailey's stint as Johnny Dollar the show changed formats. It became a five-times-a-week serial with fifteen minute episodes. Monday would see Johnny getting his assignment, and by Friday he'd have the mystery neatly solved (and his expense account filed). This period was the zenith of Johnny Dollar's career. The stories, being longer, gave range for more plot development and better characterization. The makers of the series took full advantage, turning out some of the best radio mysteries I've ever heard. The radio plays in this collection come from that &quot;golden age&quot; of the Johnny Dollar series, and each one is a gem. Radio Spirits has published a Volume 2 to this collection with six more serials. It is as good as the first. Now if they'd just publish a Volume 3.	2001-08-26

Six people are murdered at the Night Owl Cafe. Three LAPD officers (Ed Exley, Jack Vincennes, and Bud White) who come from widely different backgrounds and have widely different agendas investigate the murder. The three officers among them are responsible for at least four murders and two manslaughters. Who deserves prison more? The Night Owl killers or the murdering policemen who are stalking them? Ellroy's try for gritty realism renders up louses for protagonists. When I got to the first murder committed by one of the officers, I quit listening. Only the fact that I completely ran out of other tapes drove me back to finish the story. It was a good story, but it could have been a great one. Heroes don't need to be heroic in the sense that Sir Gallahad was heroic, but they do need to have some redeeming social merit. I've known convicted murderers with more redeeming social merit than Exley, White, and Vincennes. I don't usually prefer movies to the books upon which they are based, but \\"L.A. Confidential\\" is the exception that proves the rule. The cinema versions of Exley, White, and Vincennes have their flaws, but they're not stone cold killers.	2001-08-25

The same can be said for &quot;The Green Hornet,&quot; who was a nephew of the Lone Ranger.<br />For science fiction, we had &quot;X-Minus One,&quot;  which turned in one good story and one excellent story.  &quot;No Contact&quot; was a satisfying space opera, but &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; has to be a classic.  It is the story of Rhysling, a blind songwriter who is to space travel what Homer was to Greek mythology.	2001-08-18

Some series consisted of as few as two or three novellas. The Tarzan series stretched to 24 volumes. Almost all of the series were interrelated in some way or another. Clark A. Brady maps out the complex interrelationships in Appendix C to his \\"Burroughs Cyclopaedia\\" (available from Amazon.com). \\"Tarzan at the Earth's Core\\" makes the clearest connection between two Burroughs series. It is the 13th Tarzan novel and the 4th Pellucidar novel.<br />The Tarzan stories represent some of Burroughs' best work. The Pellucidar stories do not. Burroughs stretches credulity in all his stories, but he takes it to the limit in the Pellucidar stories. In the Pellucidar seriest Burroughs employs a preposterous concept (a hollow Earth with an inner world where time stands still) and adds insult to injury with highly improbable plot twists. This makes the quality of \\"Tarzan at the Earth's Core\\" all the more surprising. It stands as the absolute best Pellucidar story and one of the best Tarzan stories. Ironically it stands near the middle of both series.<br />David Innes, the hero of the Pellucidar stories, is in trouble. Jason Gridley, inventor of the Gridley Wave, hears the radio distress signal from the center of the Earth, and organizes a rescue party. Many stalwart adventurers, including Tarzan of the Apes, enlist in the expedition. Where Innes got to the Earth's core in a mechanical mole, Gridley's party travels there in an airship. Read the book to find out how they fly an airship to the center of the Earth and confront the many perils of the savage world they find.	2001-08-14

Wolfe sits placidly eating ballpark sandwiches and swilling down lukewarm beer. Hennesy and Goodwin employ classic gumshoe methods while Wolfe carefully hoards one little fact, waiting for the opportune moment to spring it and solve the case.

Inevitably, it omits some characters and authors, but it gives an workmanlike account of the chosen subjects.

Tolkien)	Books	5	4	8	N	N	Masterful Adaptation of Print to Audio	Bilbo Baggins entertains a number of strange visitors and becomes enmeshed in a perilous hunt for a fabulous treasure. The episodic quest story is at least as old as Homer's \\"Oddyssey,\\" and as current as \\"O Brother Where Art Thou,\\" and Tolkien proves a master in the format.<br />I first read \\"The Hobbit\\" (and the entire \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy)during finals week of my Freshman year in college. My grades suffered, and I remember almost nothing about the courses I took that semester, but thirty years later I still know the story of Bilbo, Frodo, Gandalf, and THE RING. Conan, Harry Potter, and multitudes of lesser fantasy heroes and heroines owe their inspiration to \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Read or audit the original and all else suffers in comparison.<br />One off-putting motif Tolkien employs is the ad nauseum setting forth of songs and poems (none very good) sung and recited by the characters. After suffering through a few poems, I began to skip them as I encountered them. The poetry almost persuaded me not to get the BBC radio play. I didn't think I could suffer through such an incessant cacaphony of subpar songs.<br />Thankfully, the BBC edited out almost all the songs. As to the play itself, the characters were well conceived and well executed. You couldn't have asked for a more convincing Bilbo. Almost all the major episodes remain in the play. The sound effects are great.<br />When I drive, I prefer dramatizations to the dry reading of prose, and such high quality dramatizations as this are almost on a par with reading the written word.	2001-08-14

An Egyptologist falls victim to a murderous attack in his own bedroom.  A noble young man springs to the aid of the stricken Egyptologist's beautiful daughter.  Things continue to go bump in the night as the young man, the daughter, and an ace Scotland Yard investigator attempt to guard the Egyptologist against -- what?  Gradually the mystery begins to unfold with the disclosure of a manuscript written by a Danish explorer.  As more is revealed, the story becomes less a mystery and more a tale of the supernatural.  With the solution of the mystery, the tale becomes a quest for scientific/magical discovery.  The climactic scene reminded me somewhat of Indiana Jones.<br />Refreshingly, no bandage-wrapped zombie staggers around trying to kill people.  The play differs greatly from the 1930's vintage Mummy movies with Boris Karloff.  It is light years away from the modern Brendan Frazier Mummy opuses.<br />The plot is well crafted, and the story may have broken new ground back in 1903 when it was originally published, but it seems somewhat tame by today's standards.  That very tameness adds to the play's charm.  We have a hero who is really heroic; a truly virtuous damsel in distress; no profanity; no sex; no graphic violence; and no heavy-handed moralizing.  The play provides an entertaining diversion.	2001-07-24

Volume 2 contains seven stories by a constellation of literary luminaries:  Elmore Leonard, Eric Van Lustbader, Michael Malone, Ed McBaine, Joyce Carol Oates, Anne Perry, and Shel Silverstein.<br />&quot;Sparks&quot; details the smoldering particulars of an insurance investigator's inquiry into the burning of a beautiful woman's house. Three stars.<br />&quot;Slow Burn&quot; is a police procedural weighted down by the protagonist's Freudian baggage.  It gives a disturbing look at child molestation, sexual exploitation, mental illness, and revenge.  Two stars.<br />&quot;Invitation to the Ball&quot; presents a mystery in three parts.  The protagonist, obsessed with a painting of a beautiful lady, seeks to determine whether she murdered her husband almost a century ago.  He meets and woos a descendant of the lady.  For all his interest in the ancestor, he shows remarkably little interest in the mystery presented by the descendant. The third mystery is a modern murder that ties in neatly with the other two.  Five stars.<br />&quot;Barking at Butterflies&quot;  tells the story of a man with a rival for his wife's affection.  He fantasizes about taking murderous action towards the rival.  Then . . . .  Four stars.<br />&quot;Heroes&quot; began as a war story but resolved itself into quite a nice little mystery; not so much a who-done-it as a what-did-he-do.  A good exploration of perception and reality as it relates to heroism.  Five stars.<br />In &quot;The Guilty Party,&quot; an eccentric judge applies the wisdom of Solomon to cases which come before him.  Four stars.	2001-07-22

Wolfe charters a limousine and leaves for the meeting, and Archie goes to the party.  Before anything can be announced, the host drops dead of poisoning, and the chief suspect becomes a bartender dressed as Santa Claus.  Santa disappeared shortly after the death and long before the police arrived on the scene.  Wolfe must solve the murder before Santa's identity is discovered--Wolfe's very freedom may depend on it.<br />In &quot;Man Alive,&quot; the second story on the tape, a beautiful designer is suspected of murdering a homeless man.  She hires Wolfe to keep her out of jail.  This murder is the last in a string of strange deaths that have bedeviled the designer's existence.  Unraveling the tangle of greed, jealousy, and vengeance is no easy task, but Wolfe is up to it.<br />The CBC produced 13 Nero Wolfe radio plays, and Durkin Hayes Audio has published six of them on three cassettes.

The police call it suicide, but Poirot is not convinced.  The dentist's death is followed closely by the deaths of two of his patients, and Poirot undertakes to solve the mystery.  Is it possible that these three deaths were merely &quot;collateral damage&quot; in a campaign to eliminate an influential financier, another of the dentist's patients?  Two suspects immediately present themselves for consideration: the worthless ne'er-do-well boyfriend of the dental assistant and the left-wing radical boyfriend of the financier's niece.  Both appear to have had ample motive, means, and opportunity to kill either the financier or the dentist.  Poirot solves the mystery in exemplary fashion, but exposing the killer gives him no great pleasure.  To find out why, you must read the book.	2001-07-15

You will find beer bitter and repugnant, but if you keep at it you will eventually begin to tolerate it, then to like it.  So it is with Nero Wolfe.  At first taste you will find him arrogant, eccentric, and thoroughly unlikeable.  Keep at him.  Because Rex Stout chose the novella as the format for most Wolfe stories you can read the stories at a sitting.  After three novellas you will come to tolerate the corpulent crimefighter. After five, you will even come to have some affection for him.<br />&quot;The Second Confession&quot; might better be named &quot;The Second Confrontation,&quot; because Wolfe faces his archnemesis, Arnold Zeck, for the second time.  (&quot;And be a Villain&quot; chronicled the first confrontation).  When Sherlock Holmes discovered the existence of Professor Moriarty, he immediately undertook to destroy the professor's criminal empire.  When Nero Wolfe discovered the existence of Arnold Zeck, he immediately began to avoid Zeck at all costs.  Holmes' course of action led to the Reichenbach Falls. Wolfe's led -- you'll have to find out in the final novella of the trilogy, &quot;In the Best Families.&quot;  Suffice it to say that Wolfe undertakes to expose a communist, runs afoul of Arnold Zeck, gets his orchids machine-gunned, and winds up trying to solve a murder for Zeck.  Along the way Archie gets in deep trouble with the local constabulary, Wolfe confounds the police,  the two manage to outright break several laws, and they severely bend a few more.	2001-07-15

Theodore tends the orchids, Fritz cooks, Archie does the investigative legwork, and Wolfe never leaves the brownstone.  Visitors come and go, and Wolfe interrogates them, manipulates them, and occasionally exposes one of them as a murderer.  Wolfe's universe existed almost unchanged through seventy three stories.  In one of them, however, the entire structure of Wolfe's, Theodore's, Archie's, and Fritz's world was completely destroyed.  &quot;In the Best of Families&quot; is that story.<br />A homely heiress asks Wolfe to check up on her husband. Arnold Zeck warns Wolfe off the case.  Wolfe refuses.  His home is bombed, the heiress is killed, and Wolfe disappears without a trace. Theodore takes a job in the country, Fritz goes to work in a restaurant, and Archie opens up his own detective agency.  We have some clues as to what Wolfe might be up to from comments he made in &quot;And be a Villain&quot; and &quot;The Second Confession,&quot; the first two Arnold Zeck stories.

A few days later an out-of-work machinist disappears and is found murdered.  Wolfe &quot;links&quot; the two incidents, demonstrates the first death to be a murder, and undertakes to collect the $50,000.00 reward posted for identifying the killer.  In the process he tampers with witnesses, conceals evidence, and otherwise places himself and his assistant Archie Goodwin in danger of arrest.  He turns in a dazzling display of deductive ability without leaving his home and without getting arrested in the process.<br />Most series begin at a beginning and work chronologically to an end.  The characters grow and mature, and supporting cast comes and goes.  So we have it with Horace Rumpole and Hercule Poirot.  Other series skip about, giving stories from various stages of the star's career in a manner which perplexes would-be biographers.  Sherlock Holmes is the classic example of this type series.<br />The Nero Wolfe series is a singular exception.  Wolfe never ages, never changes.  His supporting cast remains constant, and life in the brownstone is pretty much the same in the first book as it is throughout the series.  &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; is the first book in the series, and the ensemble cast is almost fully in place.  Archie, Theodore, Fritz, Saul, and the others all play much the same role as they will throughout the series.  Only the irascible Inspector Cramer is missing.<br />I came to &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; after having read several later Wolfe books.  The differed only in quality.  &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; is much better-written than most of the later stuff I've read.  The book reveals Stout to be an accomplished wordsmith and a crafter of ingenious plots.  Although his craftsmanship as a deviser of plots remained strong throughout the series, his ability to turn a phrase diminished.<br />I sometimes jot down artful phrases from books I read, hoping to possibly incorporate them into jury arguments in appropriate cases.  &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; was the first Nero Wolfe book to send me scurrying for pen and notebook.

When the new husband is discovered with a knife in his back, Inspector Cramer arrests the business manager.  As a favor to a friend, Nero Wolfe agrees to prove the business manager's innocence.  The flying fickle finger of suspicion points to one of the five greedy children, and Wolfe sets out to discover which one.  But how to get the tightly knit family to agree to come to his house after midnight to be interviewed by Wolfe?  Can Archie achieve the impossible and haul them in?  Can Wolfe untie the Gordian Knot of lies, false clues, and withheld information?<br />Wolfe turns in his usual masterful performance, but he arrives at his conclusions in uncharacteristic fashion.  He usually solves cases based on sound conclusions drawn from hard evidence.  In this case his conclusions were more intuitive than deductive.  When, in the final scene, Inspector Cramer takes the guilty party to the pokey, I could not help but ask myself, &quot;Where's the proof?&quot;<br />Listening to the tape as I took my half hour evening walk, I lost track of time and didn't return home until the tape was completed and the case solved.	2001-07-03

Nero Wolfe, who usually avoids cases, uncharacteristically seeks employment.  He undertakes to solve the case on a contingent fee basis--no solution, no pay.  Of course, he solves the case and earns his fee, but manages to please nobody in the process.<br />Wolfe is his usual gruff, eccentric, mercenary self.  He is easy to dislike, but his powers are hard to disrespect.

Zeck is a shadowy figure of immense wealth, untold political power, and criminal bent.

He seemed slothful, arrogant, pompous, and disagreeable. His assistant Archie Goodwin seemed like a somewhat deductively challenged Sam Spade.<br />My next encounter with Wolfe came in the form of the Radio Spirits editions of the old Nero Wolfe series starring Sydney Greenstreet. Greenstreet was a natural for Wolfe, bringing out Wolfe's better qualities while minimizing the flaws.  I got hooked on the A&amp;E Nero Wolfe series. What seemed like serious character flaws in the audiobook became endearing eccentricities in the TV series. I wish it a long run.<br />The A&amp;E series sent me scurrying to Amazon.com for some Nero Wolfe novels. Good exercises in logical deduction as a method of solving crimes. But the endearing eccentricities of the TV shows once again became off-putting character flaws.<br />Enter the CBC radio dramas. The CBC plays are every bit as good as the A&amp;E TV series. Since you can drive a car and listen to the CBC plays, I consider them even better.<br />&quot;Eeny Meeny Murder Mo&quot; is a dramatization of a Wolfe novel that was also done by A&amp;E. I wouldn't give you two cents for the difference in entertainment values and production qualities between the two shows. The musical score of the radio play could have been improved, but that was the only sour note in the whole production.<br />On the flip side, we find &quot;The Squirt and the Monkey.&quot;  The back panel has this to say about &quot;The Squirt and the Monkey&quot;: &quot;It's an all-out assault on Wolfe and Goodwin when one is framed for murder and the other is sued for a fortune.  A liar is playing with fire.&quot;<br />Apparently without leaving his specially made chair, and certainly without leaving the front stoop of  his brownstone house, Wolfe solves the mystery  with a tour de force exercise in deduction.	2001-07-01

Relatives have a way of thinking that the most innocent of unexpected deaths are homicide, and one of the victim's relatives raises sand with the police trying to get them to investigate the case as a murder.  Not getting satisfaction, he then retains Nero Wolfe.  A little looksee into the circumstances of the death confirms the relative's suspicions.<br />The cast of suspects is limited, but figuring out whodunnit is a tough nut to crack.  With Archie Goodwin's help, Wolfe sorts through the clues, confounds the police, and reveals the killer.  A good, well crafted yarn.<br />Because I don't like to have someone read to me, I seldom listen to audiobooks.  I much prefer radio plays and full cast dramatizations.  Why then do I find audiobooks of the Rex Stout character Nero Wolfe preferable to reading them for myself?<br />Stout crafts a good plot, and peoples it with engaging characters, but he doesn't tell a story very well.  I must force myself to read that next chapter, and I can lay the book down and leave it for long periods of time.  While reading, I can pause for reflection over Wolfe's inevitable ethical lapses and borderline criminal behavior.  I listen to audiobooks as I drive.  The story sweeps along with little or no effort from me, and there's no time to stop and think about arresting and prosecuting Wolfe and Goodwin for obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence, or harassing witnesses.<br />I recommend enjoying Nero Wolfe in the A&amp;E series, the CBC radio plays, or audiobooks.	2001-06-23

Baron Victor Frankestein has created a monster which destroyed everything and everyone Frankenstein held dear.  Frankenstein, swearing revenge, has pursued the monster half way around the world.  Finally, exhausted and near death he meets his nemesis on board the ship.  The story is told in a series of flashbacks as Frankenstein recounts his pitiful tale of woe to the captain of the ship.  The story structure remains fairly true to the plot of the book, but the writer did introduce some innovations.<br />Most surviving old time radio shows are half hour segments for weekly broadcast.  Apparently, however, daily serials with 15 minute episodes were also popular.  &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; made good use of this format, with a story beginning on Monday and concluding with the capture of the criminal on Friday.  The longer format gave the opportunity for greater character development and more fully conceived plots.<br />With all the advantages afforded by the serial format, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; makes for somewhat of a disappointment.  The dialog is over-dramatic, the characters are wooden, and they engage in illogical, inadequately motivated behavior throughout.  One unintentionally humorous feature of the play comes as the actors repeatedly deliver mid-twentieth century slang phrases with German accents.  Another discordant note is struck when Frankenstein, believing himself near death, calls to his deceased wife &quot;Elizabeth, I'm coming to you!&quot;  Of course the writers had no way of anticipating that Redd Foxx would make that phrase a comic refrain as Fred Sanford.  One particularly good thing about the play was the monster's self-justifying speeches.  Taken alone they sounded like the high-minded complaint of an innocent-but-put-upon victim of circumstance.  The monster's protestations of innocence in the face of persecution fell flat, however, when measured against his evil actions.<br />Despite the weaknesses of plot, dialog, and character development, the play had power.

Massages aren't the only thing sold at the parlor, but Featherstone is oblivious to the other goings on.  He gets only a massage and then pays with a credit card.<br />When Rumpole undertakes to defend the owner of a chain of massage parlors/bawdy houses, he learns of Featherstone's visit.  Featherstone learns the true nature of the place he visited, and Rumpole contrives to get Featherstone selected as the judge to hear the bawdy house case.  Featherstone has visions of disgrace and divorce dancing in his head, and Rumpole does nothing to allay his fears.

On this audiotape, McKern reads two short stories from &quot;Rumpole's Last Case.&quot;  The chosen stories are &quot;Rumpole and the Blind Tasting&quot; and &quot;Rumpole and the Old, Old Story.&quot;<br />In &quot;Blind Tasting&quot; Rumpole gets invited to an elegant blind tasting.  As I understand it from the story, a blind tasting is a gathering at which a bunch of egotists gather to taste wine, guess what type the wine is, and otherwise attempt to impress each other with their erudition and sophistication.  Being used to nothing better that Chateau Thames Embankment, Rumpole becomes an enthusiastic but unorthodox participant in the tasting.  The tasting leads to a case, and the case leads Rumpole to uncover some lowbrow goings-on in the highbrow world of fine wines.<br />In &quot;The Old, Old Story,&quot; Rumpole embarrasses She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed.  She harasses Rumpole, and Rumpole leaves home.  While the course of love runs not so true at Casa Rumpole, Horace gets an out-of-town case defending the odd man out in a lover's triangle.  Things are looking rather bleak for the client, and Rumpole is not encouraged when he enters court for the first day of the trial and finds She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed sitting on the bench as a guest of the presiding judge.  With his wife's help, Rumpole finds his way through to a fabulous victory, and nobody lives happily ever after.<br />Leo McKern was born to play Rumpole on the stage, and he gives it his all as he reads the stories, but an audiotaped reading is not the best way to enjoy any form of literature.  If it is impossible to read the stories or watch McKern on video, this tape will slake your thirst for Rumpole.	2001-06-11

Have you ever labored to solve a puzzle only to find a piece or two missing?<br />In this case Christie assembles a cast of suspects, gives them ample motive and opportunity, gives them all reasons to lie, throws in a group of clues that simply cannot be reconciled in any logical fashion, and then brings off a solution which explains everything and exposes a killer you'd never suspect.<br />The story (originally titled &quot;Murder for Christmas&quot;) was written in 1938, the same year Christie wrote &quot;Appointment with Death.&quot;  The two stories share much in common.  &quot;Appointment&quot; features a fabulously wealthy, tyrannical matriarch who delights in tormenting her children.  &quot;Christmas&quot; features a fabulously wealthy, tyrannical patriarch who delights in tormenting his children.  By the time the matriarch/patriarch is bumped off, the reader is ready help kill him/her.  The children in both stories are all pathetic weaklings.  Despite their weakness, the reader can develop affection for some of them.<br />&quot;Appointment&quot; featured a rather straightforward, easily achieved modus operandi and Christie's favorite murder weapon--poison.  &quot;Christmas&quot; served up a locked room mystery with a diabolically clever methodology fraught with the peril of miscarriage.<br />One feature of the murder was the vast amount of blood shed when the victim was stabbed.  The murderer would have been covered with blood, but none of the suspects seems to have any blood on them.  Having read &quot;Murder on the Orient Express,&quot;  I was familiar with Christie's seeming lack of understanding of the dynamics of blood spatter in stabbing cases.  In this case, however, there was a very good explanation for the non-detection of blood on any of the suspects.<br />Christie never ceases to amaze with her perpetrators.  In one case the narrator was the killer.  In another the apparent victim turned out to be the murderer.  Murderers keep falling out of the woodwork from the most unexpected places.  She once even had the butler do it!  Poirot's theory of the case insisted on the murderer being a family member.

Wolfe's corpulence, indolence, sagacity, and appreciation for the finer things of life can come only from the model of Mycroft Holmes.<br /><br />Archie Goodwin's antecedents are a little more complex.  He has the energy of Sherlock Holmes, the loyalty of Dr. Watson, and the gritty toughness of Sam Spade.<br /><br />In this book they do something that was unheard of in 1965 when the book was written--they take on the FBI.  Their client is being stalked by agents of the FBI, and they must stop it.  Incidentally, they have to solve a murder in which the prime suspects are three FBI agents.<br /><br />They solve the mystery, cage the FBI's dogs, earn their obscene fee, and nobody but the reader lives happily ever after.  It is truly entertaining to read how a handful of private citizens humble the mighty, monolithic FBI.<br /><br />Several incidents in the story made it appear that Wolfe and Goodwin had a cavalier attitude towards investigative ethics.  In one scene Wolfe talks to Goodwin about the murder case.  The two decide that it would be best to prove the FBI Agents didn't commit the murder.  They then decide that's what they'll do.  This is not the way to investigate a murder case.  The objective of a murder investigation should never be to prove that someone did or didn't commit a murder.  The objective of the investigation should be to determine who committed the murder.  You might think that I'm splitting hairs, but I am not.  When one sets out to prove that someone committed a murder, he can develop tunnel vision and ignore significant clues that point in other directions.  Only after the murder is conclusively identified should the mission shift to proving he did it.<br /><br />This was my first Nero Wolfe novel.  It was good enough to warrant reading further novels.	2001-06-09

There's an old joke about a woman who saw Hamlet performed for the first time. &quot;I don't know what anybody sees in that play,&quot; she said, &quot;it's just a bunch of cliches strung together.&quot; Whether Hamlet spawned or merely perpetuated cliches, the play abounds with phrases that have passed into the common speech. From beginning to end, from &quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot; to &quot;goodnight sweet prince&quot;, familiar language assaults the ear. The long life of these sayings attests to Shakespeare's powerful plotting and powerful language. Critics have hailed &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Shakespeare's masterpiece, prompting Oscar Wilde to ask &quot;Are the critics mad or merely pretending to be?&quot; It is a complex and paradoxical play, with complex, paradoxical protagonists engaging in complex, illogical behavior. Whether the play is a masterpiece or a disasterpiece, good or bad, is fairly debatable. But good or bad, it commands our attention and entertains us.<br />The Dover Thrift Edition provides quality reading at a rock bottom price.  Inexpensive, but not cheap!	2001-06-08

It is the first Holmes novel I read as a child, and the combination of ancient curse, foreboding moor, and modern danger kept me turning the pages.<br />&quot;The Hound&quot; is unique among the Holmes novels because for a large part of the mystery, Holmes' character is offstage, appearing only at the last moment to bring events to a hair-raising denouement.<br />Holmes is a brilliant but eccentric detective.  Sometimes his personality quirks lead him into danger.  Holmes is both tenacious and audacious, and the interplay of those two qualities almost bring him to grief.  He loves to hold his cards close to his vest, and sometimes excludes others from information vital to their safety.  He also loves to engineer dramatic climaxes to highlight his deductive powers.  Holmes' joint penchants for secrecy and sensation almost gets his client killed, but all's well that ends well.<br />The Dover Thrift Edition offers quality entertainment at a rock bottom price.

The three join forces to solve the murders of a physician and a priest.  They interview the suspects, conduct meetings, compare notes, and all the while a May-December romance brews between the actor and the youngish female admirer.<br />Hercule Poirot appears sporadically through the course of the book, but takes no active part in the investigation until the denouement.  When a third murder occurs, all the pieces fall into place, and Poirot is able to identify the killer in dramatic fashion.<br />The mystery is neat, well crafted, and satisfying.  The identity of the murderer comes as quite a surprise, and Poirot turns in his usual virtuoso performance.  The plot, however, suffers from Poirot's extended absence, and the story has a glacial pace.  It took forever to slog through the soporific first two acts.<br />An interesting revelation comes at the end of the book.  Poirot fans know him as a boastful, eccentric dandy whose mastery of the King's English is far from masterful.  He has this to say about himself: &quot;It is true that I can speak the exact, the idiomatic English.  But, my friend, to speak the broken English is an enormous asset.  It leads people to despise you.  They say, 'A foreigner.  He can't even speak English properly.'  It is not my policy to terrify people.  Instead, I invite their gentle ridicule.  Also, I boast.  An Englishman, he says 'A fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much.'  That is the English point of view.  It is not at all true.  And so, you see, I put people off their guard.  Besides, it has become a habit.&quot;	2001-05-31

A.B.C. declares his intent to begin a series of killings and dares Poirot to stop him. Unbeknownst to Poirot, Alexander Bonaparte Cust ticks a name off a list and heads for the locale of the first murder. Poirot's &quot;little grey cells&quot; work overtime as the victims fall in alphabetical order.<br /><br />This book seemed a real departure from Christie's formula for Poirot mysteries. &quot;Ah, I thought, Christie is anticipating the 'Columbo' format, where the murderer is known from the outset.&quot; Another departure for Christie was the fact that three of the four eventual victims were nobodies. Christie's victims usually come from the elite upper crust.<br /><br />I followed the story with much interest. I have been involved in a number of serial homicide cases, and several plot themes rung true. The interminable &quot;task force&quot; meetings. The media frenzy. The warring egos of the investigators. Several things didn't ring true, however. The almost antiseptic nature of the murders. Serial homicides are usually messy. The varied modus operandi of the killer. (Blunt trauma, strangulation, knife). Most serial killers find a method that works and stick to it. For most serial killers, murder is a sort of hobby. There was no indication A.B.C. was deriving any sort of pleasure from the killings (other than the pleasure of thwarting Poirot).<br /><br />Alexander Bonaparte Cust is finally laid by the heels, and an airtight case is made against him. Poirot visits Cust and obtains a confession, then he gathers the friends and relatives of the victims to explain the murderer's motivation. One thing that the modern media loves to emote over is the motivation of the various serial killers they have glamorized. To me the explanation is simple enough, they enjoy killing. I therefore took a deep breath and waited for Poirot to give a psychobabble explanation.<br /><br />Boy was I surprised. You will be, too. A.B.C.'s motivation was astonishing.

Joe Friday is the archetypical good cop, but Jeff Regan is something else entirely.  He hates his job and hates his boss, a Mr. Lyon.  Lyon is the heartless, soulless head of the International Detective Agency, and Regan refers to himself as &quot;The Lyon's Eye.&quot;<br />Orson Welles is &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; in an adaptation of the famous William Gillette play.  Welles over-acts as usual, and the story is somewhat hectic.  Regardless of the flaws, Sherlock Holmes is still the best detective ever, and this episode is the only remaining example of Gillette's classic play.  Gillette shamelessly engaged in wholesale borrowing of incidents from the original Holmes stories, and Holmes aficionados will enjoy connecting up the play's incidents to the stories they were drawn from.<br />Sydney Greenstreet (the Fat Man from &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;) is &quot;Nero Wolfe,&quot; and he plays the part with gusto.

This happens in plain sight of thirteen passengers on a plane flying from France to England.  How did the killer produce a blowpipe, place it to his/her lips, and shoot a poison dart across a crowded passenger compartment without being noticed?  Where did the wasp come from?  How could Hercule Poirot, the greatest detective of all times (if you don't believe it just ask him), sleep through a murder committed right under his nose?<br />Obviously it couldn't have happened that way.  But if not, how did it happen?  And who did it?  Almost everyone on board has a motive to kill Madame Giselle, and almost eveyone on board does a little lying before the mystery is solved.  Poirot sorts through the clues, unmasks the liars, and eventually figures out not only whodunnit, but also howdunnit and whydunnit.<br />I don't gamble, but I wouldn't be gambling if I wagered that you, the reader, will not unravel the mystery.  I thought I had finally solved one ahead of Poirot when Christie artfully pulled the rug out from under me.  Curses, foiled again!	2001-05-11

Aunt Laura Wellman loves them all.  They all appear to love Aunt Laura's money.  When Aunt Laura dies intestate, the question of who inherits seems simple indeed.  The characters occasionally appear shallow, but they can also display depth of character.  Elinor (who got Aunt Laura's estate) could be very likeable if she didn't hate Mary so.  Despite her hatred, Elinor honors Aunt Laura's dying wish and settles a tidy sum on Mary.  Mary behaves nobly throughout.  Roderick acts like a dunce throughout, but is capable of occasional sparks of nobility.  Dr. Lord stands on the sidelines and makes moon eyes at Elinor.  Is this a murder mystery or a soap opera?  Where is Hercule Poirot?  Doesn't the cover say this is a Poirot mystery?  That's the only reason I bought the radio play.  I'm at the end of tape one, and no Poirot in sight.<br />Mary dies and an autopsy reveals poisoning by morphine.  Aunt Laura is exhumed and found to have died from morphine poisoning also.  Elinor, who has motive and opportunity in spades for both deaths also appears to have the means.  Finally Dr. Lord shakes off his inactivity and calls in Hercule Poirot to save the woman he loves.<br />Poirot engages in the usual snooping and deduction, catches everyone lying, reveals all the dark secrets, and guides Elinor's barrister in the defense of the case.  He also figures out whodunnit.  At least he amasses enough evidence to . . . but I don't want to give away the story.  I'd hate to destroy your enjoyment when you figure it out for yourself.<br />When the time comes for Mary to die, you will have grown to like her so much that you will truly regret her killing.  You will also share Dr. Lord's forlorn faith in Elinor's innocence.  This novel has a much smaller cast of suspects than most Poirot novels, but the murderer's identity should remain opaque at least until the commencement of Elinor's trial.<br />The BBC radio play is very well done, as are all the BBC plays of Christie's Poirot stories, but the cover gives too great a hint as to the murderer's identity.  Luckily, I pay more attention to the writing on the back of a book cover than I do to the picture on the front.

I was not disappointed.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised.  The &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; story was, of course, a 20th Century detective story, but it had a Western setting, and Ranger Jase Pearson got to ride his trusty horse Charcoal as he tracked the bad guy through the mesquite.  &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; was a little out of place, but not much.<br />The other stories easily divided themselves into three types:<br />[1] Juvenile Westerns: &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;, and &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;.  All three were boyhood heroes of mine, and the stories proved quite enjoyable.  &quot;Hopalong  Cassidy&quot; actually turned in a creditable mystery.  I also learned that Clayton Moore was not the only person ever to play the Lone Ranger.  Brace Beamer did a superlative job of playing the masked man.<br />[2] Western episodes from anthology series:  &quot;The Lux Radio Theatre&quot; turned in a radio dramatization of the movie &quot;The Plainsman&quot;, an inaccurate, forgettable biopic on Wild Bill Hickock.  &quot;Screen Director's Assignment&quot; presented &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and Ward Bond.  The production values were excellent.  They had to cut some characters and delete plot features to compress the movie into a 30 minute radio play, but the story was still compelling.  &quot;Wild Jack Rhett&quot;, from &quot;Escape&quot;, inspired the long running radio and TV series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.  The show might also have influenced John Wayne's final Western, &quot;The Shootist&quot;.<br />[3]  Adult Westerns:  &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; has to be the archetypical adult Western, and William Conrad makes for a convincing Matt Dillon.  Hearing his voice, however, I couldn't help but conjure up a mental image of his later TV character, &quot;Cannon&quot;.  The other offerings, however, were every bit as good.

This began a semi-fascination with vampire movies which continues to this day.  I've not seen all the Dracula movies, but I'd seen dozens before I read the novel after graduating college.  Nothing I've ever seen on the screen compares to Bram Stoker's original story.  The story, which is told in the format of journal entries, letters, and newspaper clippings, engrossed me and carried me headlong to the final chapter.<br />The power of Stoker's written masterpiece exceeds the power of any screen production by a power of 10.  Film isn't even the second most powerful medium for Dracula.  The Naxos Audiobooks production of Dracula features a full cast but retains the format of the book.  Different actors speak the journal entries of the various parties, with dialog and action being dramatized.  Audio plays have been called &quot;the theater of the mind&quot;, and that description well suits the Naxos production of Dracula.  All in all, the audio play gives a satisfying way to experience the legend of Dracula.	2001-04-17

He talks about the duties of citizenship and the decay of Western civilization.  His observations relating to use of force, child rearing, and social responsibility are not &quot;politically correct&quot; in this modern day and age.  His views on the equality of women weren't &quot;politically correct&quot; when he wrote.<br />Back in the late 50's and early 60's I read and re-read this book until I completely wore out two copies.  I often skipped over the philosophical sections to get to the &quot;good stuff&quot;--the action.  I didn't appreciated the philosophy, but I did love the action.  I also didn't realize that the book was an allegory for WWII.  Heinlein served in the Navy during WWII, and this might account for the decidedly Pacific flavor of the book.<br />The Bugs are the Japanese.  They fight every bit as tenaciously as the Japanese did, and in the end they are as thoroughly defeated.  The bombing of Buenos Aires is, of course, Pearl Harbor.  The Mobile Infantry is the Marine Corps.  The world where they take R&amp;R is Hawaii.  The capture of the Brain Bug might correspond to the cracking of the Japanese code and the ambush of Yammamoto.  Other parallels can be drawn, but you can push the analogy too far.  The numerous landings correspond to the amphibious assaults of the island hopping campaign which was to culminate in the final amphibious assault on the Japanese homeland.  That last assault was made unnecessary by Hiroshima.  Heinlein ends his book with a thinly veiled criticism of Hiroshima.  Toward the end of the war, the Earthly forces had perfected the &quot;Nova bomb&quot;, which could simply destroy an entire planet. Although Earth had the technology to simply destroy the Bugs' home world, they decided to spend the lives necessary to capture the world by assault.<br />Although I was too bone-headed to appreciate the Pacific War/Bug War parallels as a child, I did pick up on Heinlein's criticism of Hiroshima, and parrotted it to my father.  Dad was a Marine during WWII and had been slated to participate in that last assault.  Needless to say, Dad had an entirely different take on the bombing.

Attempts are being made on the life of Nicky Buckley, the pert proprietress of End House.  Poirot sets out to foil the would-be murderer, but feels that he's failed miserably when Nicky's cousin dies instead.  Poirot redoubles his efforts to save Nicky and to solve the cousin's murder, but he finds himself in a quandary.  As Poirot fruitlessly attempts to discern a motive and discover the murderer, Nicky has another narrow escape from a poisoning attempt.  Poirot finally decides that the only way to flush the murderer out is to fake Nicky's death.  The denouement is both surprising and satisfying.  Another nice thing about the story is the glimpse into the mind of Poirot as he sorts out the clues.  In this case he does not keep his thoughts and surmises secret from Captain Hastings, and we follow him step by step as he winnows through the evidence to come to his conclusions.  He does, however, hold back enough to surprise the reader in the final chapter.<br />Now for the critique: [1] Christie either knows nothing about the behavior of bullets or expects her readers to know nothing.  Her description of the near fatal shooting of Nicky is as full of holes as Nicky's hat.  Poirot took no notice of the fact that there was no noise from the report of the pistol, no noise from the ricochet of the bullet, and no scuff mark on the wall.  No mention was made of the bullet being deformed by striking the wall.  This is not the first time Christie has betrayed such ignorance.  In the short story &quot;Dead Man's Mirror&quot;, a bullet struck a gong without denting the gong, deforming the bullet, or depositing a lead scuff on the gong.  [2] Although Poirot twice stated that the simplest explanation was the best, the final explanation was not simple.  It was so complex and convoluted that such a series of events could never have converged to produce Christie's result.  [3] Again we see Christie borrowing from Arthur Conan Doyle.  One of Sherlock Holmes' favorite maxims was &quot;When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot; Poirot paraphrases Holmes thus: &quot;when you have eliminated other possibilities you turn to the one that is left and say - since the other is not - this must be so.&quot;  I can't say Poirot improved on Holmes' proverb.thur Conan Doyle.

Poirot and Hastings confront an international cabal intent on nothing less than world domination.  Close calls and near misses abound, and early on in the saga Poirot extricates himself and Hastings from certain death with a deus ex machina worthy of the most futuristic weapon ever employed by James Bond.<br />As Holmes and Watson dueled to the death with Moriarty and his three henchmen in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; and &quot;The Empty House&quot;, Poirot and Hastings do battle with the Big Four.  Moriarty's aims were more modest than the Big Four's, but Poirot's battle was no more earnest than Holmes'.  Just as Holmes' smarter brother, the indolent Mycroft, assisted in the defeat of Moriarty, Hercule's smarter-but-lazy brother Achille assisted in the defeat of the Big Four.<br />The story proved fun to read, but it wasn't up to the best of Christie's efforts.	2001-04-13

Christie turns in three novellas and a short story, and all four are excellent.  Christie, however, proves predictable in her unpredictability.  In three of the stories, simply pick out the least suspicion-worthy individual in the cast of suspects and you have your perpetrator.<br />&quot;Dead Man's Mirror&quot; tells the story of the apparent suicide of a megalomaniac nobleman.  It starts off as fine locked room mystery, and the motives for murder among the suspects are numerous.  Poirot pieces the matter together from the array of clues he uncovers and eventually nabs the killer by the exercise of his &quot;little grey cells&quot;.  He didn't have to work nearly that hard.  Christie overlooks one phenomenon of close range gunshot wounds--backspatter.  All Poirot had to do was look around and see who had clothing begrimed by backspattered blood.<br />In &quot;The Incredible Theft&quot; the culprit is obvious from the outset, but who among the cast of suspects did the culprit use to actually purloin the papers?  Poirot works through the problem with admirable insight and solves the mystery quite handily.  I set the story down quite satisfied, but then it occurred to me that the problem was seriously flawed.  When you finish the story, see if you can't figure out a simple way for the thief to have taken the papers completely without detection.<br />&quot;Murder in the Mews&quot;, another apparent suicide case, serves up a story so realistic it could have actually happened.  Christie sets out clue after clue to show that the death wasn't suicide, but again she omits one telling clue.  In my experience, most women who commit suicide with a handgun shoot themselves in the chest, not in the head.  This serves as a good rule of thumb, but women shoot themselves in the head often enough that you can't completely rule out suicide on that basis alone.  Poirot's solution dumbfounds the police and the reader alike, but the story comes to a very satisfying conclusion.<br />&quot;Triangle at Rhodes&quot;  serves up another story that is true-to-life enough to have actually happened.  Poirot, on vacation, observes a love triangle developing on the sunny beachs of Rhodes, and successfully predicts murder.  He fails in his attempt to prevent the murder, but is on had to see to it that justice is meted out to the guilty.  The least true-to-life aspect of the story is Poirot's prescience in predicting not only the pending murder, but the victim and the guilty.  How he does this is not revealed, and the clues provided in the leadup were not enough for anyone to be able to predict murder with any degree of certainty.unds the police and the reader alike, but the story comes to a very satisfying conclusion.<br />&quot;Triangle at Rhodes&quot;  serves up another story that is true-to-life enough to have actually happened.

How he does this is not revealed, and the clues provided in the leadup were not enough for anyone to be able to predict murder with any degree of certainty.	2001-04-09

An American millionaire's daughter is garrotted, and he calls in Hercule Poirot to solve the murder.  The cast of suspects is much smaller than in &quot;Orient Express&quot;, but Poirot faces a &quot;Herculean&quot; task in sorting out the clues and bringing the killer to justice.  An excellent plot and interesting characters make for great entertainment, but Christie once again gives her audience the idea that she really knows nothing about the mechanics of real-world murders.  I can't discuss the details without giving away too much of the plot, but suffice it to say that the mechanics of ligature strangulation are such that the the killer would probably not have had to provide Poirot with the  linchpin clue which helped solve the case.  I audited the tape as I drove on a long business trip and enjoyed it tremendously.  The reduced cast of suspects made the story much easier to keep up with than in most other Poirot mysteries I have audited.	2001-04-08

The stories are taut, well-plotted, and surprise endings abound.  Not all the cases are murders, but Poirot acquits himself admirably no matter what type conundrum he faces.  To me, Poirot is more enjoyable in the short story format than in novel-length stories.  The plots have to be simpler, the cast of suspects smaller, and the clues and red herrings less abundant.<br />Christie's Poirot is still heavily indebted to Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  I don't mean this as a negative.  Doyle's Holmes was likewise heavily indebted to Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin.  Let's catalog a few of Christie's more obvious borrowings from Doyle.  Many of the stories are entitled &quot;The Adventure of . . .&quot;  Almost all Doyle's short stories were entitled &quot;The Adventure of . . .&quot;  As the first story opens, Poirot and Captain Hastings (aka Dr. Watson) are living in a second story apartment and have a landlady.  The first story opens like Doyle's &quot;Beryl Coronet&quot; or &quot;Case of Identity&quot;, and has a denouement strongly suggestive of &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot;.  One story, &quot;The Adventure of the Cheap Flat&quot;, is an interesting twist on the plot of  &quot;The Red Headed League&quot;.  In one story Captain Hastings is seen fetching books off the bookshelf for Poirot just as Watson did for Holmes.  Once Poirot echoes Holmes when he says &quot;You know my methods by now, use them.&quot;  &quot;The Veiled Lady&quot; takes its title from Doyle's &quot;The Veiled Lodger&quot;, its opening from &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, and its plot is a very interesting twist on &quot;Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;.<br />Christie is beginning to declare her independence from Doyle's influence, however, as evidenced by Poirot's disdainful recitation of Holmes' methods for examining crime scenes.  Christie even attempts to put Poirot above Holmes when she has Poirot solve a mystery that stumped Holmes.  One of Holmes' rare failures was the incredible mystery of Mr. James Phillimore (who stepped back into his house to get his umbrella and was nevermore seen in this world).  Poirot solves a very similar case in &quot;The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim&quot;.  Christie even includes one of his failures, &quot;The Chocolate Box&quot;. This story  ends with Poirot asking Hastings &quot;If at any time you think I am growing conceited. . . . You shall say to me `chocolate box', it is agreed?&quot;  just as Holmes once said to Watson &quot;If it should ever strike you that I am getting a little overconfident in my powers . . . kindly whisper `Norbury' in my ear. . . .&quot;e a mystery that stumped Holmes.

The narrator, a military man recently wounded in battle and invalided home, runs into an old friend. This chance meeting leads to an unlikely collaboration with an eccentric detective. The crime is murder by poisoning, and in the end, the poisoner is brought to justice. No, this is not &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle, and the narrator and detective are not Watson and Holmes.<br />I had enjoyed several of Christie's later Poirot novels before reading &quot;Styles&quot;, and I had never suspected that Agatha Christie patterned Hercule Poirot so much after Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. I've already noted the similarities in the plotting of Poirot's and Holmes' debut novels, but there is more. Holmes was tall, thin, bohemian, and utterly British. Poirot was short, fat, fastidious, and decidedly un-British. Holmes' examination of the crimescene in &quot;Scarlet&quot; was very similar to Poirot's in &quot;Styles&quot;, but Holmes would never have flinched at examining the contents of the dispatch box. Holmes solved his mysteries by logical deduction, Poirot by the exercise of the &quot;little grey cells&quot;. Both could get so involved in the work of detection that they cut quite comical figures. Both labored mightily to keep the detectives from Scotland Yard on the right track. Both men's confidence in their abilities bordered on arrogance, and both held their cards close to their vests before dramatically divulging the villian.<br />Holmes was always one for a pithy aphorism on detection. Poirot also: &quot;Imagination is a good servant and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.&quot; &quot;Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory; let the theory go.&quot; &quot;It is always wiser to suspect everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction, that they are innocent.&quot;<br />There are similarities, but we cannot press them too far. Differences abound. Christie writes a much more Byzantine plot that Conan Doyle ever did, and in this case she arrives at the simplest explanation in the most complex, convoluted, contrived, and circuitous route imaginable. She also likes to play tricks on the reader, so beware! I occasionally wanted to cry foul during the course of the book, but her storytelling was so delightful, and the ending so satisfactory, that I had to applaud even as I felt somewhat betrayed.a much more Byzantine plot that Conan Doyle ever did, and in this case she arrives at the simplest explanation in the most complex, convoluted, contrived, and circuitous route imaginable.

The &quot;Black Museum&quot; and &quot;Crime Classics&quot; do an excellent job of recreating true life crime stories. &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot; provide exactly the type of entertainment their titles suggest.<br />One really interesting story from the &quot;Suspense&quot; cassette was 'Ghost Hunt', which anticipated &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; by approximately fifty years.  'The House on Cypress Canyon Road' served up suspense, pathos, and paradox in equal helpings, and is probably my favorite story of the entire collection.<br />Arch Oboler's &quot;Lights Out&quot; provides three excellent stories, one suspense, one supernatural, and one ('Murder Castle'), with a seemingly preposterous premise.  The seemingly silly premise was, however, based on the career of a true life serial killer.  &quot;Murder at Midnight&quot;, &quot;The Sealed Book&quot;, and &quot;Weird Circle&quot; all have campy introductions but creditable stories.<br />&quot;Mystery in the Air&quot;, starring Peter Lorre, was a summer replacement show that dramatized classic stories.  &quot;Quiet Please&quot; turned in a couple of good efforts with 'Pathetic Falacy', about a &quot;thinking machine&quot;, and 'Red and White Guidon', which started off looking like a misplaced Western but ended up a quite satisfying tale of the supernatural.<br />The last tape in the collection, &quot;The Whistler&quot;, had three excellent stories with captivating surprise endings.  In each episode the narrator trumpeted the fact that the story would have a surprise ending, and in spite of that the stories never failed to surprise and delight.<br />There are some sour notes in the collection, but all in all, I had sixty hours of listening pleasure from this anthology.	2001-03-23

The three stories make up a satisfying trilogy of mysteries as Poirot tours the Near East finding murder everywhere he goes.<br />All three of the stories follow Christie's tried-and-true formula: She introduces the cast of suspects, gives each of them a dark secret and a motive to lie, and piles up the circumstances in such a way that the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to every one of them at some time or another. She compounds the confusion by supplying false leads and deliberatly glossing over hot clues. In each case Poirot holds his cards close to his vest, tantalizes the reader/listener with cryptic comments, and finds the most inconsequential-appearing facts to be highly significant. Eventually Poirot airs everyone's dirty laundry, explains his chain of deductive reasoning, reconstructs the crime in all its improbable complexity, and gets a confession.<br />Of the three stories, however, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; presents the most feasible modus operandi for the murder, as well as the most likely motivation for murder.  This is a roudabout way of saying that &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; is the most realistic of the three.<br />I listened to the BBC production of &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; and found it the easiest of the three stories for the listener to follow.  For &quot;Orient Express&quot; and &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; you need a flow chart to keep up with all the twists, turns, and complexities of the plot.  All in all, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; provides the listener with an entertaining, satisfying story of murder and mayhem.	2001-03-05

I've yet to read or audit all of Christie's Poirot novels, but of the ones I've enjoyed, &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot; proved the greatest departure from Christie's tried-and-true formula for Poirot novels.  Lady Edgeware is estranged from her husband and wants a divorce.  If she can't have a divorce, she says she'll just drive up to her husband's house in a cab and walk in and murder him.  Shortly after making this pronouncement, Lord Edgeware is murdered.  Lord Edgeware's servants testify that Lady Edgeware drove up to the home in a cab, walked into Lord Edgeware's study, and left after a brief period of time in the study.  Shortly afterward, the servants find Lord Edgeware dead in his study.<br />This is as true-to-life a murder scenario as ever came from the pen of Agatha Christie.  In 27 years of prosecuting and defending murder cases, I've had several that followed this plotline.<br />But Christie isn't going to allow things to be that simple.  It seems that twelve unimpeachable witnesses are all prepared to testify that Lady Edgeware was with them at a formal dinner at exactly the time of the murder.  The cast of suspects is smaller than in most other Poirot novels, and the clues just cannot be made to fit together to prove guilt against any one of them. Poirot finally unravels the mystery, and in the denouement provides sudden surprises as the murderer is revealed. Unlike several of Christie's other Poirot novels, the prosecutors have a winnable case without an unlikely confession from the killer.	2001-03-05

She was listening to Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on the other channel.  Two things contributed to the hysteria caused by Welles' broadcast.  Firstly, the news-report format of the show was extremely realistic, and secondly a number of listeners switched over to &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; partway through the broadcast when an unpopular singer followed a commercial on the Charlie McCarthy show (I thought people didn't start channel surfing until the invention of the TV remote).<br />One wit said that all the intelligent people were listening to the dummy and all the dummies were listening to &quot;The War of the Worlds.&quot;  But that is unfair.  When I listened to the show the first time, I was struck by the realism of the radio announcer's panicked description of the Martian attack.  It reminded me of the broadcast of the Hindenburg tragedy, and I wasn't at all surprised to learn that the actor who played that part had consciously tried to model his delivery after that broadcast.  We'd like to think we're smarter than our countrymen from that earlier time, but you need only look to the recent Y2K panic to realize we're not as sophisticated as we think.<br />&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; isn't the only gem in the collection.  &quot;Donovan's Brain,&quot;  &quot;The Martian Chronicles,&quot; &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea&quot; are classics by anyone's definition.

In both Christie adopts the motif of narrating the story from the point of view of someone who undertakes to assist Poirot in the solution of the mystery.  Christie introduces the cast of suspects, gives each of them a dark secret and a motive to lie, and piles up the circumstances in such a way that the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to every one of them at some time or another.

I listen to radio plays as I drive on business, and I find the Poirot plays hard to follow because of the large cast of characters and the complexities of plotting.  Poirot could probably be enjoyed more readily in print.  You could then read, re-read, take time out to mull over the complexities, and follow the story much better.  Probably the best way to enjoy Poirot would be to read the story first, and then listen to the radio play.	2001-03-01

Jack Webb played an anti-hero in &quot;The Whistler&quot;, but Webb's bad guy was a sort of a tarnished Joe Friday.  Webb seems incapable of having played anything other than a jaded tough-guy.

In fact, the Mesopotamian murder mystery occurred just before Hercule Poirot traveled to Istanbul and caught the Orient Express.  As a team of archaeologists labors away at an ancient Tell, the leader's wife has her head smashed in a room which no one else could have entered or left.  The local constabulary is mystified, and Hercule Poirot, who just happens to be traveling in the area, is called in to consult.  After some preliminary investigation to get the lay of the land, Poirot decides that everyone on the dig, with the exception of the husband and a recently retained nurse, is a suspect.  He then begins his methodical quest to make some sense out of the available evidence and solve the &quot;locked room&quot; mystery of the wife's death.  During the course of the investigation the reader comes to suspect every single member of the team, and by the time the mystery is solved, the reader has been thoroughly bewildered by the bizarre turns of events.  The solution is both logical and satisfying, and it accounts for all the loose ends quite nicely.  Unfortunately, it is so highly improbable as to be near ludicrous.  Whoever ultimately prosecuted the case should have thanked his lucky stars that the murderer confessed when confronted by Poirot. Poirot's solution was a work of sheer logic without, as Poirot admitted, a shred of evidence to back it up.  Poirot followed Sherlock Holmes' formula of eliminating the impossible.  What he was left with, although improbable in the extreme, was what must have happened.<br />Christie entertains throughout, but I have two quibbles:<br />1.  She deliberately misleads the reader in two particulars as the story unfolds, so that the solution becomes all the more surprising.<br />2.  Christie spins an entertaining yarn, and she may have been very knowledgeable on the subject of murder, but she betrays absolutely no understanding of the mechanics of perpetrating real-life murders or conducting real-life murder investigations.  The killer's modus operandi reminds me of Rube Goldberg.  The murderer's plan was so complex, so dependent upon others unwittingly doing just exactly as expected, and so likely to miscarry even if everyone followed the script, that no intelligent murderer would attempt it. When Poirot announces his solution, he prefaces his remarks with the caveat that he hasn't got a shred of evidence to back it up.  After being confronted, the murderer obligingly confesses.  An investigator attempting to get a murderer to confess would never announce going in that he had no evidence.  A murderer confronted with zero evidence of guilt would never, ever supply the deficit by confessing.<br />I listened to the BBC radio production of the story as I drove on a long business trip.

Hyland was a fictional character played by an actor.  Why does a true crime series have a fictional host?  I also found Hyland's breezy narration of the stories a little off-putting.

Most of those on the left wing of Biblical scholarship would argue that &quot;conservative Bible scholar&quot; is an oxymoron, but Blomberg proves them wrong.  He gives a masterful study of the Synoptic Problem, arriving at the two (or four) document hypothesis as the most satsifactory solution.  Next he engages in a cogent critique of modern methods of Biblical criticism, pointing out the worth of such methods as well as their preconceptions and limitations.<br />He then undertakes a study of the historicity of the Gospel stories, and turns in the most compelling scholarly argument I have ever read for the historical reliability of the resurrection narratives.  So far, so good.  Five stars up to this point.<br />Unfortunately, it is in his assessment of Gospel historicity that he goes astray.  Blomberg argues repeatedly for the &quot;camcorder exactness&quot; of the Gospel stories. If the Gospels say it, that's exactly the way it happened, and any discrepancies from one story to the next are merely &quot;apparent&quot; discrepancies, which can be ironed out with enough imagination.  As one who has made a career of evaluating and presenting testimony, I find that discrepancies in testimony don't equate to falsehood, and that it is neither necessary nor wise to pretend that there are no discrepancies in testimony.<br />Blomberg appears to begin with the conclusion of historical accuracy and to sift the evidence for arguments supporting his conclusion.  That's not the way you do it.  You work the evidence to form conclusions; you don't form the evidence to fit conclusions.  You begin with no firmly fixed preconceptions.  You collect your evidence, form a hypothesis that explains the evidence, collect more evidence, modify your hypothesis, collect more evidence, modify your hypothesis, and keep doing that until your are satisfied that your conclusions are valid.  Only after you have arrived at your conclusions in an unbiased fashion, do you then argue for your conclusions.  When you argue for your conclusions, you don't defend the indefensible.  Trying to defend too much weakens your argument as a whole.  Blomberg tries to defend too much.  Example:  Blomberg acknowledges that even the majority of conservative scholars find it unlikely that John wrote the Gospel of John.  After making the concession, he then argues vehemently for John's authorship of the Gospel.  The Gospel never claims it was written by John, and authorship by John is not necessary to a finding of historical accuracy.  Why, then, defend John's authorship so staunchly?

These twelve stories include some of the best of Holmes: &quot;The Speckled Band,&quot; &quot;The Red Headed League,&quot; &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia.&quot;  Doyle continued his Holmes saga with other collections of short stories: &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes,&quot; &quot;Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes,&quot; &quot;His Last Bow,&quot; and finally &quot;The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes.&quot;  Almost every Holmes short story bears the title &quot;The Adventure of . . .&quot;  One of my favorite Holmes stories is &quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge.&quot;  Not only is it a very good yarn, it is a &quot;Problem&quot; and not an &quot;Adventure!&quot;  Although Conan Doyle ran out of Holmes stories, the public did not run out of its appetite for new Holmes stories, and production of pastiches continues to this day.<br />To me, the most satisfying way to relive the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, both original and pastiche adventures, is through the medium of audiotaped radio plays.  There are at least four collections of adventures currently available.  &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,&quot; a publication of BBC shows starring Clive Merrison, reprises the original twelve adventures. This is probably the best radio collection of adventures.  National Public Radio has published four &quot;Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; consisting of four one hour productions starring various actors as Holmes.

He books passage on the Orient Express, and becomes an earwitness to a murder in the adjoining sleeper compartment.  A desperate criminal attempting to escape some unknown retribution has been stabbed twelve times in his sleep.  The train becomes snowbound and Poirot is asked to solve the mystery while the passengers await rescue.  It begins as a locked room mystery with all the possible suspects possessing ironclad alibis.  Poirot labors mightily in unraveling the Gordian Knot.  As the plot unfolds, the circumstances become more and more bizarre, until at the end, Poirot makes perfect sense out of everything.<br />Poirot's insights appear more intuitive than logical, but he proves to be a shrewd guesser.  He doesn't seem to have the deductive powers of Dupin or Holmes, but he makes a quite satisfactory detective nonetheless.<br />The audio dramatization published by BDD was excellent.  I had a long drive on a business trip, and the miles went by much faster as I listened to the story, staying several steps behind Poirot throughout.  It proved so good that I listened to it again on the way home.<br />One quibble about Christie's work.  She wound up giving a very logical explanation for almost all the improbabilities that occurred in the story, but she (or at least the audio version) overlooked one very salient feature of such a stabbing.  There would have been bloodspatters all over the victim's sleeper and probably trailed down the hallway of the sleeper car, and the killer would have been unable to dispose of his/her bloody clothing.  In reality, Poirot should have been able to solve the mystery by following the killer's blood trail or canvassing the train for the bloody clothing.	2001-02-02

Then they address form criticism,<br />redaction criticism, and Gospel genres.  Finally they embark upon a<br />quest for the historical Jesus.<br />The analysis of the Synoptic Problem<br />is particularly good.  Each theory is studied in detail, its strong<br />and weak points weighed and assessed, and a final judgment<br />passed. They finally settle upon a modified form of the Goulder<br />hypothesis, sometimes known as Mark without Q.  Of the currently<br />fashionable literature on the reconstruction of Q, they say:<br />&quot;This work is mostly of curiosity value, since it shows how far a<br />hypothesis can be pushed despite its lack of fundamental<br />support.&quot;<br />The middle sections on the various types of criticism<br />and Gospel genre are not as good, the analysis being turgid and<br />sometimes opaque, but they redeem themselves when they go questing for<br />the historical Jesus.  They &quot;cross examine&quot; the Gospels,<br />using four precise tests for historicity.  The four tests put one in<br />mind of the Jesus Seminar's &quot;seven pillars of scholarly<br />wisdom&quot;.  The Jesus Seminar's seven pillars are not nearly as<br />well-conceived nor as well-applied as Sanders and Davies' four tests.<br />The conclusions Sanders and Davies draw at the end of their quest are<br />astonishingly circumspect when compared to the findings of most<br />contemporary questers after the historical Jesus.	2001-01-12

His analysis is thoroughgoing, well-researched, and heavily documented.  Unfortunately, his defense of evidence for the early dating lacks the cogency and forcefulness of his attack on the evidence for later dating.  While Wenham is vociferously dismissive of evidence contrary to his viewpoint, he uncritically accepts evidence supporting his viewpoint.  He bedrocks his early dating on a two pronged analysis: 1.  Dismissal of the documentary solutions to the Synoptic Problem, and 2. Heavy reliance on the Patristic evidence of authorship.  Firstly, the documentary explanations of the Synoptic Problem must be dismissed because if the Gospels were based on earlier documents, they must perforce be later documents.  Secondly, from acceptance of the Patristic evidence of authorship, Wenham can infer a very early date for each of the Synoptics.  The book makes interesting reading, but it fails to carry the day in establishing such an early date for the Synoptic Gospels.<br />One caveat:  If you can't read Greek, the first half of the book will be rough sailing, as it analyzes many gospel pericopes in Greek.  With a little patience you can, however, muddle your way through it.	2001-01-12

As a prosecutor who has labored 25+ years in the rural South, I can attest to the authenticity of the stories.  Almost any one of these cases could have happened in my jurisdiction.  The mysteries are fun to listen to as you &quot;help&quot; Jase and his partner Clay Morgan winnow through the clues to bring the bad guy to justice.  Pearson is a sort of cross between Joe Friday and Mat Dillon, with a little Sherlock Holmes stirred in.  As good as Pearson is, however, he is not infallible.  Several times you will want to grab him by the sleeve and pull him back onto the right track as he wanders down blind alleys.<br />Now for the quibbles:  The characters are cardboard at best, and you occasionally encounter gender and ethnic stereotyping.  Apparently forensic science has gone backwards since the 50's.  The Rangers' crime lab does some things that would challenge modern crime labs.  Pearson runs roughshod over the 4th and 5th amendments to the Constitution.  Searches without warrants abound, as do arrests without probable cause.  Pearson engages in several gunfights and displays superhuman marksmanship.  He almost invariably &quot;wings&quot; his opponent without doing serious injury.  Real gunfights just don't happen that way.  As the Sundance Kid reportedly said to Butch Cassidy, in a gunfight you &quot;aim for the middle.  That way if you miss a little, it don't matter so much.&quot;<br />Despite the shortcomings, &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers&quot; is an authentic, entertaining collection of radio plays that will give hours of listening pleasure.	2001-01-05

There's an old joke about a woman who saw Hamlet performed for the first time. &quot;I don't know what anybody sees in that play,&quot; she said, &quot;it's just a bunch of cliches strung together.&quot; Whether Hamlet spawned or merely perpetuated cliches, the play abounds with phrases that have passed into the common speech. From beginning to end, from &quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot; to &quot;goodnight sweet prince&quot;, familiar language assaults the ear. The long life of these sayings attests to Shakespeare's powerful plotting and powerful language. Critics have hailed &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Shakespeare's masterpiece, prompting Oscar Wilde to ask &quot;Are the critics mad or merely pretending to be?&quot; It is a complex and paradoxical play, with complex, paradoxical protagonists engaging in complex, illogical behavior. Whether the play is a masterpiece or a disasterpiece, good or bad, is fairly debatable.  But good or bad, it commands our attention and entertains us.<br />The &quot;BBC Presents&quot; audio version of Hamlet is long--3 1/2 hours over four cassettes. Most audio publications of Shakespeare's plays run to two cassettes. One contributing factor to the length is the inordinate amount of music. Lengthy musical performances mark the separation between acts and major scenes. The music does not enhance the production.	2001-01-05

We watch as his ambition drives him to murder, murder drives him to anguish, and fear and envy drive him to further murders.  As he wades deeper in blood he begins to recognize by degrees that all his struggles will end in rack and ruin.  We can sympathize with him up to a point, but when he kills MacDuff's wife and children, he loses all claim upon our compassion.  There is, however, a certain nobility to be found in fighting a lost cause to the bitter end.  Leonidas at Thermopylae, Travis at the Alamo -- both command our respect.  MacBeth redeems himself somewhat when, recognizing MacDuff as his Nemesis, he stands his ground and goes down fighting.<br />The sound quality of the Harper Audio edition suffers in comparison to the Harper Audio edition of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.  The dialog was crisp and clear in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, but &quot;MacBeth's&quot; was somewhat difficult to understand in places.  Anthony Quayle turns in a workmanlike performance as the title character, but he did much better as Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.  Whatever the minor shortcomings of the audio edition, MacBeth stands as one of the greatest tragedies to come from Shakespeare's (or anyone else's) pen, and the experience of listening to the play is more pleasurable than reading it or (to me at least) watching it performed on videotape.  The only thing better than listening to the tape is watching a live performance by a talented cast.	2000-12-30

The scraps are believed to be from the Gospel of Matthew.  When they were discovered, they were dated to the time period 80-100 A.D.  Thiede re-examines the scraps and finds them to date from around 60 A.D.  Such a dating would mean that Matthew's Gospel most likely was written by an eyewitness.  It would also mean that the four document hypothesis, that well-respected mainstay of Gospel scholarship, is dead wrong.  Thiede tries manfully to explain how he came to the dating.  In so doing, he must explain the arcane, esoteric, and almost impenetrable world of papyrology.  It makes for slow, painful reading, and students who are not familiar with the science of the study of papyrus scraps will have to take much of what Thiede says on faith.  Those of a conservative bent will readily embrace Thiede's findings; the more liberal Bible students will not.  Whichever side you take, or even if you fall somewhere in the middle, you should find it worth your effort to read this book.	2000-12-27

He is sought just as fervently and proves just as elusive.  This book is actually Crossan's second quest for the historical Jesus.  His first was &quot;The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant.&quot;  That book was long, meandering, and not terribly interesting.  This second book is a distillation of the theories presented in the earlier book, and it has two virtues its predecessor lacked: brevity and lucidity.  Crossan brings a prodigious level of scholarship to the task of finding the historical Jesus, and a reading of this book will give the student fresh insight into Jesus' nature, personality, and teachings.  It will not, however, give an accurate picture of the historical Jesus.  Crossan commits the same error that almost all previous questers after the historical Jesus have fallen into: He finds the Jesus he set out to look for.  What, then, is an accurate picture of the historical Jesus?  That is a question we must all answer for ourselves.  This book, and others like it, can give us pieces of the puzzle, but the proper assembly of those pieces is up to us.	2000-12-27

The core of both hypotheses was that Matthew and Luke used Mark and as one of their primary sources.  The other primary source was a hypothetical collection of the sayings of Jesus that scholars denominated &quot;Q&quot;, from the German word &quot;Quelle&quot;, which means &quot;source&quot;.  The four document hypothesis remains the subject of lively debate, but it has this in common with democracy: Although it's not a very satisfactory explanation, it's better than all the others.  &quot;Q&quot;, then, is a hypothetical document which may or may not have existed.<br />Mack takes this hypothetical document as his foundation and builds an elaborate hypothetical textual history and an elaborate hypothetical history of the community which purportedly produced it.  He achieves his results by piling speculation upon inference upon hypothesis.  Mack then states his hypothetical results as though they were &quot;the Gospel truth&quot;. (Pun intended).  Mack commits the error of the foolish builder in the Q story found in Luke 12:42-46 (Matthew 7:24-27; Mack's QS 42).	2000-12-27

It portrayed a much different Jesus from the one I learned about in Sunday School.  After having read this and a number of other literary quests for the historical Jesus (Including Albert Schweitzer's original &quot;Quest for the Historical Jesus&quot;), I have come to the conclusion that whosoever questeth after the historical Jesus findeth the Jesus he is looking for.  Smith set out to find a magician, and lo and behold, that's what he found.  In &quot;The Passover Plot&quot;, Hugh Schonfield set out to find a pious fraud, and, wonder of wonders, that's exactly what he found.  There are a myriad of scholarly quests for the historical Jesus, and each one finds the Jesus that the scholar goes looking for.  Each one, however, can add texture to the student's own personal understanding of Jesus.  &quot;Jesus the Magician&quot; is well written, well researched, and well argued.  It doesn't carry the day in persuading the reader that Jesus was nothing more than a magician, but it does help the reader to understand how and why Jesus did some of the things he did.	2000-12-21

Books	1	7	51	N	N	Blackballing the Deeds of Jesus	In &quot;The Five Gospels&quot;, the Jesus Seminar cast lots to determine the words of Jesus.  In this volume they cast lots to determine his deeds.  Red balls meant &quot;I think Jesus did this&quot;, pink meant &quot;He may have done this&quot;, grey meant &quot;He might have done this&quot;, and black meant &quot;He didn't do this.&quot;  From this interesting book we &quot;learn&quot; that Jesus, the son of Joseph and Mary, was executed under Pontius Pilate, but he did not rise bodily from the dead.  After his death, Mary of Magdala thought she saw Jesus, as did the Apostle Paul.  Simon Peter may have also thought he saw Jesus, but then again, he may have been lying.  During Jesus' life he was thought to be both mad and the agent of Beelzebub, and he associated with various undesirable elements of society.  He had a ministry as an itinerant preacher, and he did some faith healing.  He enjoyed a brief popularity before running afoul of the law.  Of the 176 incidents from Jesus' life and postresurrection ministry reported in the Bible, the book finds fewer than ten to be certainly factual, and a few more to have possibly happened.  In &quot;The Acts of Jesus&quot;, the Seminar uses the same flawed methodology that I criticized in my review of &quot;The Five Gospels&quot;.  In &quot;The Five Gospels&quot;, the Seminar found (with apologies to Yogi Berra) that &quot;Jesus really didn't say most of what he said&quot;.  In this sequel, the Seminar finds that &quot;Jesus really didn't do most of what he did&quot;.  If Jesus had said and done only what the Seminar finds worthy of belief, the authorities would have found it hardly worth the effort to crucify him.	2000-12-15

At every point the Romans speak beautifully of honor, virtue, courage, and other noble qualities.  If we listened only to their words, we might think them noble, but when we see their deeds, we find the play thick with irony. The speakers must either be hypocrits or have no self-objectivity.  Portia, Brutus' wife, emerges as the only admirable character, but the play still commands our full attention.  Mighty words are match by mighty deeds, but noble thoughts are checked by ignoble actions.  When Antony pronounces Brutus &quot;the noblest Roman of them all&quot;, he merely recognizes Brutus as the best of a bad lot.  Regardless of the villainy of the characters, the play is superb, and audio may well be the best medium for fully enjoying it.	2000-12-08

Harald traveled throughout Russia and Europe, became a mercenary soldier of the Varangian Guard in Byzantium, and eventually returned to Norway to claim the throne.  Over the next twenty years he became known as Harald Hadradi (Harald the Ruthless). He ruled Norway with an iron hand, made constant war on Denmark, and won renown as the most feared warrior in Europe.  At age 51 Harald undertook his most daring endeavor--the invasion of England.  In 1066 he landed an army in Northern England, and did battle with the Saxons at Stamford Bridge.  My highschool history books told much about 1066, the the Battle of Hastings, and the Norman Conquest, but nothing of Harald Hadradi.  I had quite a surprise when I read this book as a college student.  What might have been had the Battle of Stamford Bridge gone differently?  Nineteen days later at Hastings William the Conqueror would have faced Vikings under Harald Hadradi, not Saxons under Harold Godwinson.  What might have been had Harald not invaded?  At Hastings the Saxon army would have been neither fatigued by forced marches nor battered from the desperate Battle of Stamford Bridge.  Although we cannot be certain of the hypothetical outcome of the Norman invasion under such changed circumstances, we can be certain of this: The story of Harald is intriguing and action-packed.  Harald may not cut a very sympathetic figure, but his prowess and his deeds command a begrudging admiration.	2000-12-07

Cyrus of Persia attempted to usurp the throne with an army stiffened by 10,000 Greek mercenaries.  The author found himself among that number.  Cyrus went down to defeat and death at the Battle of Cunaxa, but one contingent of his army emerged victorious--The Ten Thousand.  Alone and unsponsored, surrounded by enemies, and deep in the heart of Persia, The Ten Thousand began their fighting retreat to the sea and freedom.  Along the way they met with battle, treachery, hardship, and death.  Xenophon became one of their leaders, and eventually lived to write this stirring account of their exploits.  The successful retreat of the Ten Thousand served as proof to Phillip of Macedon that a Greek army could conquer Persia, and he made his preparations for the invasion. Phillip's death forestalled his plans, but Alexander took up his father's project and the rest, as they say, is history.  If there had been no Westward march by the Ten Thousand, there may have been no Eastward march by Alexander.	2000-11-30

Herodotus undertook to write of the Greco-Persian War, and he began his account with an exploration of what he perceived to be the causes of the war.  In so doing, he launched off into an investigation of almost every aspect of Ancient Near Eastern ethnography, geography, and culture.  His investigation becomes a rambling, entertaining account which finally gets around to talking about the war.  Herodotus exercised no critical judgment as to the historical worth of his sources, and many suspect that he may have intentionally fudged his facts more than a little.  Because of this, some say he is better remembered as a Father of Lies than as the Father of History.  This criticism is unfair. Herodotus stands a pioneer in the field of history.  Pioneers sometimes get things wrong, but that happens when you're exploring uncharted territory.  The writing of history begins with Herodotus; those who follow may have written it more accurately, but few have made it such fun.	2000-11-30

Bury wrote his &quot;History of Greece&quot;  before World War I, but it was such a good overview of classical Greek history that the third edition was still being used as a college textbook in the late 1960's.  Although only selected portions of the text were assigned reading, I read the book cover to cover and have kept it to this day.  Bury writes in a lucid, easily understood style that entertains as it educates.  Although Bury recounts campaigns and battles in stirring fashion, he does not neglect the Greek contributions to politics, the arts, and sciences.  Except for his obvious dislike of the Spartan King Agesilaus, I found Bury to be fair and even-handed in his  evaluation of the peoples and events that shaped Greek history.	2000-11-25

In addition to model bodybuilding regimens, he gives suggested training programs for numerous sports, from &quot;all around athlete&quot; to &quot;wrestler&quot;.

Leckie hit the beaches with the First  Marine Division and lived through the privation, hardship, and carnage to  tell a gripping story of this pivotal Pacific campaign.<br />Leckie gives good  character sketches of the principle participants on both sides and details  great acts of courage by many of the rank-and-file warriors who  participated in the  campaign.  For example, Leckie recounts the tale of  Sergeant Major Vouza of the Guadalcanal constabulary.  Vouza acted as a  scout for the Marines and was captured by the Japanese.  He was tortured,  stabbed in the throat, and left for dead.  When he came to his senses, he  crawled back to the American lines in time to warn of a planned Japanese  attack.  During that arduous journey, Vouza prayed that he live just long  enough to get back and bring the warning.  Vouza survived and later act as  a scout for Carlson's Raiders.<br />When he describes the &quot;big  picture,&quot; Leckie doesn't do quite as well, and the reader will  occasionally succumb to spells of confusion in trying to follow major troop  and ship movements and understand their strategic significance.  Despite  this minor flaw, the reader will come away from this book with a clear  understanding of just how close the United States came to the brink of  unmitigated disaster on Guadalcanal.<br />Arrogance, incompetence, and blind  staggering luck contributed to the cliffhanger nature of the conflict, as  did courage, tenacity, and toughness.  Both sides had more than their share  of all six.  The argument could be made that if the Americans had not had  more good luck than the Japanese, the War in the Pacific would have taken a  much different course.  But then, that brings to mind the old saying  &quot;The harder you work, the luckier you get.&quot;	2000-09-14

Of the three, Xiang qi is played by the most people;  Shogi is the most exotic; and orthodox chess is the most thoroughly  studied.  It is the thoroughness of study of orthodox chess, and the wealth  of literature on the subject, that makes chess variants attractive.  If  someone beats you at orthodox chess, he may have won simply because he had  the better library rather than the better skill.  Since chess variants are  little studied, so the theory goes, the winner should be determined by the  greater skill, not the greater library.<br />Pritchard's book deals with 18  variations on the theme of European chess.  Games of this type--which can  be played on a regular chessboard with regular pleces--are usually referred  to as &quot;Fairy chess.&quot;  The differences between Fairy chess  variants and orthodox chess can be minimal, as in Displacement chess and  Randomized chess, or profound, as in Dynamo chess and Ultima.  Pritchard  gives the rules for each variant, describes some simple strategy, and gives  a few illustrative games.  He tries to arrange the games from simplest  (Extinction chess in chapter 1) to most complex (Dynamo and Ultima in  chapters 17 &amp; 18).<br />He then finishes off the book with chapters on  Shogi and Xiang qi, and an afterword describing certain chess variant  sources.<br />Pritchard reviews the following games:  1.  Extinction chess aka  Survival of the Species; 2. Racing Kings; 3. Displacement chess; 4.  Randomized chess; 5. Marsellais chess; 6. Doublemove chess; 7. Losing chess  aka Suicide chess; 8. Progressive chess; 9. Kriegspiel; 10.  Alice chess;  11. Triplets; 12. Avalanche chess; 13. Hostage chess; 14. Co-ordinate  chess; 15. Knight relay chess; 16. Magnetic chess; 17. Dynamo chess; 18.  Ultima.  19. Chinese chess; 20. Japanese chess.<br />Most of the games will be  familiar to chess variant enthusiasts, but Triplets, Hostage chess, and  Magnetic chess are relatively new and unknown.  Chess variant enthusiasts  will inevitably be disappointed that Pritchard left out their favorites.  I  wish he had included Chessgi, but given the logistical problems with  playing Chessgi, I can understand why he included the similar game of  Hostage chess instead.<br />Almost all these games are included in Pritchard's  earlier work, &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants,&quot; which  describes myriads of chess variants.  If you're only going to buy one book  on chess variants, get &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants.&quot;  It  may cost a little more, but the few extra dollars brings descriptions of  hundreds of extra games.

Howard had many heroes (Bran Mak Morn, Black Vulmea, Red Sonja,  Kull, Solomon Kane), but Conan was his best developed character, and the  Conan stories were the best of his writings.<br />Howard got an opportunity to  publish a novel in England, and he fell back on his old standby, Conan, to  serve as the protagonist.  Howard expected that his English audience would  never have heard of Conan, so he borrowed a number of motifs from several  of his short stories.  Those who take the time to read all of Howard's  Conan stories will recognize many of the elements in &quot;Hour of the  Dragon.&quot;<br />Alas, the book deal fell through, and Howard had to publish  &quot;Hour of the Dragon&quot; in a pulp magazine.<br />Whatever Howard's  difficulties in publishing the book, he had no difficulty in writing a  wonderful tale of heroic fantasy.

Joe was not a spiffy little action figure.  He was a  put-upon dogface with a sidekick named Willie.  Together the two friends  faced the rigors of training camp, the mindless bureaucracy of a massive  army, and the horrors of war.  As Dilbert helps modern workers cope with  corporate insanity, Joe and Willie helped their generation deal with war's  insanity.<br />This little collection of cartoons offers us a window into an  earlier time fraught with hardships we modern Americans can't even imagine.

Because of his aversion to  seeing folks &quot;banged up in the nick,&quot; he (almost) always defends.  His insights into trial practice, human nature, and the manipulation of  opposing counsel are priceless.  He fears no man, but he quakes in the  presence of She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed (his wife).  He is Horace Rumpole, the  bane of judges and the champion of the Timsons, a large and industrious  family of South-London villians.  Not only a master advocate, Rumpole is a  detective of the first order, and he usually solves the various mysteries  he confronts with dispatch and good humor.<br />Well written mysteries,  excellent insight into human nature, dry British comedy, and a loveable  character who has been labeled the best mock-heroic fatty since  Falstaff--What more could a mystery lover or a reader of courtroom drama  wish for?  A &quot;Fourth Rumpole Omnibus!&quot;	2000-08-11

John Mortimer makes Horace Rumpole  as real as any  fictional lawyer can be, and in the process, Mortimer perfectly captures  the joys and woes of trial practice, giving it all a good leavening of  humor--something essential to a trial lawyer's retention of  sanity.<br />Mortimer entertains and enlightens.  Not only do you get  satisfying mysteries told with just the right amount of humor, you also get  insight into the foils and foibles of trial lawyers and judges.  The book  abounds with dead-on insights into the mechanics of trying cases.  Any  lawyer would benefit from reviewing Rumpole's maxims of trial practice.  A  few examples:<br />&quot;As for me, I'm not sure that I like cast iron alibis.  They're the sort that sink quickest, to the bottom of the  sea.&quot;<br />&quot;A bit of delay, I have found it an infallible rule,  never does any harm to the defense.&quot;<br />&quot;It's no help to the  defense in an obscenity case to have anyone actually read the works in  question.&quot;<br />Mortimer tries to include at least one lawyerly aphorism  in each short story in the collection, and part of the joy I find in  reading and re-reading the stories comes from searching for these little  nuggets of wisdom.	2000-08-09

One recurring theme of the stories is  lawyer-client relations, which can become quite strained on occasion.  As  always, Horace Rumpole has a few insightful remarks to make on the  subject:<br />&quot;People show an almost comic relief at not being locked up.  They actually enjoy not having to share one chamber-pot through endless  nights with vindictive, frightened, and sexually frustrated  strangers.&quot;<br />&quot;One thing you can never guarantee about clients is  that they won't behave like lunatics.&quot;<br />&quot;I could win most of my  cases if it weren't for my clients.  Clients have no tact, the poor  darlings.  No sensitivity.  They will waltz into the witness-box and blurt  out things which are far better left unblurted.&quot;<br />&quot;They're all  guilty of something, my dear old thing.

I went with Holmes and Watson from the foggy streets of  London to the English countryside to the Reichenbach Falls where Holmes and  Moriarty fought their last battle.  Radio plays stimulate the mind to a a  degree that television never can, and these stories served up mental  stimulation of the first order.  As good as &quot;A Baker's Street  Dozen&quot; is, though, it doesn't quite measure up to the quality of the  BBC series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes.  Gielgud is undoubtedly the  better actor, but Merrison is the better Holmes.<br />Despite the fact that  Gielgud doesn't capture Holmes' energy as well as Merrison, &quot;A Baker's  Street Dozen&quot; is superb listening.  It would make an excellent  addition to any mystery lover's audio library.<br />One minor quibble:  I  can't understand why they renamed three of the stories.  &quot;The  Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; became &quot;The  Blackmailer;&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Golden Pince Nez&quot; became  &quot;The Yoxley Case;&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Dying  Detective&quot; became &quot;Rare Disease.&quot;  In each case, Conan  Doyle's choice of titles was superior.	2000-08-06

Solutions often lead to more  problems, and such is Gussie's fate.  Her husband lacks the courage to  either help or support her, and Gussie resorts to an equally horrible wrong  to save her family.  This crime becomes a dark secret that molds and shapes  the lives of four generations of women in Gussie's family.<br />The ladies go  through their mundane existences, make mistakes, wed, divorce, and have  children, and all the while flowers cover Gussie's secret.  Some of the  ladies are likeable.  Some are not.  None are perfect.  The story, however,  is compelling, and the suspense builds as the listener awaits the seemingly  inevitable discovery.<br />Then, as the Vietnam War winds down, a series of  events involving leukemia, a dog, and a gazebo brings the story to a rather  paradoxical close.<br />Not being particularly drawn to this type of story,  I wouldn't have listened to it, but for a long car trip my wife and I took.  The trip introduced me to a capable wordsmith who has crafted a compelling  story, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to broaden my literary horizons.	2000-08-04

Simpson Got Away With Murder	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Five Fathers of Defeat	The old proverb says that &quot;victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.&quot; This adage, of course, speaks to the numbers of people who would claim credit for the victory or take the blame for the defeat. In reality, defeat often has more fathers than victory. Senator Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child; in most cases a botched criminal prosecution also comes about as the result of multiple mistakes by multiple parties. Bugliosi explores five of the fathers of defeat in the Simpson case, and does a commendable job of making a fair assessment of the case. Other factors, of course, played their part, but Bugliosi's five loomed large in the fiasco.<br />In the arena of criminal prosecution, there is always at least one identifiable whipping boy upon whom you can lay the blame: the prosecution team. This is because, no matter how long it has been brewing, the disaster comes to fruition on the prosecutor's watch.  When the jury pronounces that ghastly phrase, &quot;Not Guilty,&quot; it's the prosecutor who is there in front of the cameras.  Of course, the prosecutors made mistakes, but Bugliosi goes a bit too far in laying blame at their feet. The prosecutors did enough to win on a level playing field.<br />Trial lawyers are nothing if they are not supremely confident of their own abilities.  Bugliosi is quite sure that he could have won a conviction.  Bugliosi is like all good trial lawyers:  he  cannot look at the work of another trial lawyer without thinking that he could do better.  No doubt he would not have made the same mistakes that Clark &amp; company made.  He would, however, have made mistakes.  He would also have had problems overcoming the multiple mistakes of the investigators and forensics experts.  In some cases the fates conspire against you so that nothing you can do will avert defeat.  Such was the case in People v. O.J. Simpson.<br />Other than these two false steps, Bugliosi has written a concise, insightful critique. In addition to his stated purpose of analyzing the &quot;fathers of defeat&quot; in the Simpson case, Bugliosi incidentally provides numerous insights into the mechanics of investigating, building, and trying a criminal case.In addition to his stated purpose of analyzing the &quot;fathers of defeat&quot; in the Simpson case, Bugliosi incidentally provides numerous insights into the mechanics of investigating, building, and trying a criminal case.	2000-07-24

He soon discovers that his keepers do not have his best interest at heart.  He engineers an escape and begins to search for his identity.  He discovers that he is Corwin,  Prince of Amber, and claimant to the vacant throne.  Corwin's quest of self  discovery becomes in turns a quest for self aggrandizement, for revenge, to  right terrible wrongs he has done, and finally to save the very fabric of  the universe.  This quest consumes the first five books of the  \\"Complete Chronicles of Amber,\\" and a rousing tale it is.  Corwin  has supernatural powers, but he is not the cardboard, two dimensional hero  so often encountered in \\"Sword & Sorcery\\" fiction.  Corwin is  a complex, conflicted hero capable of great good and horrible evil, who  experiences a spiritual transformation as the story progresses.<br /><br />In the  next five books, Merlin, son of Corwin, describes his search for his  missing father.  Whereas Corwin was a man of action who solved problems  with his sword or his fists, Merlin is more cerebral.  He is also a  magician.  Merlin has adventures every bit as fantastical as those of his  father, and the story ends with Merlin in the most paradoxical situation  imaginable.<br /><br />Zelazny published the first Amber book in 1970, and the final  volume came out in 1991.  He obviously intended to continue the series  because the chronicle abounds with unfinished business.  Corwin's new  Pattern never got explored.  The nascent threat of Ghostwheel was never  resolved.  Frakir was left tied to a bedpost.  It is unfortunate that these  loose ends will never be tied up.<br /><br />Roger Zelazny writes of unforgettable  larger-than-life protagonists engaged in epic struggles, and his powers of  description are nothing short of poetic.<br /><br />A FOOTNOTE: I had never read Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe stories until quite recently.  Roger Zelazny is the Raymond Chandler of science fiction and Corwin is the Philip Marlowe of Sword and Sorcery.rcery.	2000-07-16

It is the first Holmes novel I read as a child, and the combination of ancient curse, foreboding  moor, and modern danger kept me turning the pages.<br />The BBC has once again  done a masterful job of adapting the novel to the format of radio drama.  When I first stumbled on to the BBC Holmes series, I thought Clive Merrison  to be a scandalous over-actor, but going back and rereading some of the  Holmes stories for the first time in decades shows that Merrison, of all  the portrayers of Holmes, just might have gotten the oddball genius most  nearly right.  Holmes had a histrionic streak which caused him to keep his  deductions secret until he could reveal them in the most sensational  fashion possible, and Merrison captures this quirk of Holmes' character  perfectly.<br />&quot;The Hound&quot; is unique among the Holmes novels  because for a large part of the mystery, Holmes' character is offstage,  appearing only at the last moment to bring events to a hair-raising  denouement.  Holmes' joint penchants for secrecy and sensation almost bring  his client to grief, but all's well that ends well.  This radio play  begins, continues, and ends very well.	2000-07-15

If they are  not ready to wholeheartedly endorse the concept of a God, at least they  seem no longer willing to dismiss it out of hand.<br />We moderns have long  thought ourselves too smart, too well educated to believe in a Divine  Being.  Doesn't science disprove God's existence at every turn? Glynn  undertakes to demonstrate that it does not, and that the deeper our  scientific knowledge becomes, the more it supports the concept of a God.<br />He first discusses the &quot;anthropic principle,&quot; which seems to  state that life is the result of such a string of highly improbable  accidents, that its emergence must have been the work of some guiding hand.  Secondly he discusses the salubrious effects of religious belief and  religious practice on physical and mental health, and suggests that man may  be genetically coded to believe in God.  Finally, he discusses near death  experiences, and he ends with a chapter on &quot;Reason and Spirit.&quot;<br />The book does not deal with any matter in depth, but it does give a good  overview of the subject.  It seems that in Pascal's Wager (which Glynn  discusses in the book) the smart money is on God.	2000-07-15

In succession he confronts the murder of the publisher of the local paper, the murder of the police chief's brother, and the murder of a beautiful woman.  The publisher's father, convinced that local gangsters are responsible for his son's death, employs the Op to break up the organized crime stranglehold on Personville.  The Continental Op determines that he cannot quickly destroy the crimelords by lawful means, so he decides to work outside the law to destroy them.  The murder of the police chief's son provides him with a golden opportunity to maneuver the rival gangs into lethal conflict. During these investigations, peripheral characters drop like flies as rival gangs feud over turf.  The Continental Op continues his investigations, stirs up strife among the gangs, and tries to elude arrest himself as the dance of death lumbers to its bloody denouement.  It is near impossible to keep an accurate bodycount through the course of the novel.  Despite the carnage, the detective work is excellent, the intrigue is gripping, and the mysteries are satisfying.<br />This book inspired three movies: Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; the Clint Eastwood oater &quot;A Fistful of Dollars,&quot; and the Bruce Willis prohibition era epic &quot;Last Man Standing.&quot; I haven't seen &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; but the Eastwood and Willis movies hardly compare to &quot;Red Harvest&quot; for complexity and character development.

They are alike in many other ways, but someone seeing both games for the first time might never suspect that they are so  closely related.<br />Shogi is a challenging and satisfying game.  It is  visually a little off-putting to the Western tyro, but Westernized sets are  available.  I'd recommend switching to Japanese sets as soon as you can  decipher the hieroglyphics.  Play with authentic Japanese pieces enhances  the pleasure of the game tremendously.<br />Fairbairn's book is the better of  the two introductory books on Shogi that come from Western authors. (Trevor  Leggett's &quot;Shogi: Japan's Game of Strategy&quot; is the other).  The  book is well organized.  Fairbairn begins with six chapters on the basics  of the game.  Chapter 7 is a collection of mating problems, and then  Chapter 8 introduces the reader to a complete game.  Fairbairn then gives a  chapter on castles.  (In Chess there are two castles, in Shogi there are  dozens).  Then he gives chapters on the opening, the middle game, and the  endgame.  The endgame to Shogi is much more exciting than the endgame in  Chess.  In Shogi the board is just as cluttered with pieces as in the  beginning, and frequently both kings simultaneously totter on the brink of  checkmate.  The penultimate chapter deals with certain of the finer points  of Shogi, and the final chapter gives a collection of games.  As the old TV  commercial says, &quot;Try it, you'll like it!&quot;<br />After reading this  book and playing a few games, if you'd like to learn the game in greater  depth, try to find &quot;Better Moves for Better Shogi,&quot;  a bilingual  book written by Aono Teriuchi, a Japanese Shogi champion, with an English  translation by John Fairbairn.	2000-07-11

On the brink of being thrown back into the sea, they held on,  and then they advanced.<br />Rear Admiral Keiji Shibasaki, the defender of  Tarawa, had told his troops that it would take a million men a thousand  years to capture the island.  It took the Marines three days, but victory  came at a terrible cost.  The carnage was so horrific that when news of the  cost of victory got back to the United States, enlistments in the Marine  Corps plummeted.<br />As Col. Alexander takes the reader through those three  hellish days, you cannot help but be awed by the suffering the Marines  endured, and by the courage they displayed.  It makes one wonder how the  men could perform at all, much less perform as well as they did.<br />A  gripping story of epic heroism in the face of near insurmountable odds--and  it's true.	2000-07-11

At first glance, Shogi bears no resemblance whatsoever to Chess.  The 9x9 board is uncheckered and is  marked with dots similar to those on a Go board.  The pieces look like  little pentagonal arrowheads or wedges, and enemy pieces are distinguished,  not by color, but by the direction in which they point.  Probably the most  intimidating aspect of Shogi is that the pieces' ranks are displayed in  Japanese hieroglyphics.  The pieces' ranks appear in black on one side, and  their promoted value in red on the other side.  The pieces are really quite  easy to learn, and although Westernized sets abound, the game loses some of  its charm when played with pieces marked with English initials and arrows  indicating the movement of the pieces.<br />For almost twenty years, until the  publication of John Fairbairn's &quot;Shogi for Beginners,&quot; this book  served as the only English language introduction to the game.  Fairbairn's  book is more thorough and gives deeper insight into the game, but  Fairbairn's diagrams are in Japanese hieroglyphics.  Legget's book uses  Westernized symbols which are easier to decipher.  Leggett's book also has  this advantage over Fairbairn's:  It comes with a cardboard punchout Shogi  set.<br />Thus, Fairbairn's book gives better instruction, but Leggett's is  more user-friendly.	2000-07-11

I say appear, because toward the end of the book, when they arrive at  incidents which the adult reader will have lived through and will recall  well, they miss the mark more often than they hit it.  It makes one wonder  if their description and analysis of the more distant events might not be  skewed as well.<br />When the book is read with the realization that the  authors write from a particular socio-political agenda, then the thoughtful  reader can sift their views through the filter of healthy skepticism.

John Gollon, a noted authority on chess  variants, had a similar experience when he was writing &quot;Chess  Variations.&quot;  He thought he'd include a chapter on jetan for some  comic relief, so he made a jetan set and played a few games.  He found  jetan &quot;quite good--very playable and interesting.&quot;  He then  pronounced jetan &quot;not a mere novelty, but ... a respectable  game.&quot;<br />These two singular achievments (Ghek &amp; jetan) are not the  only details that make &quot;Chessmen&quot; so enjoyable.  Gahan of Gathol  (aka Turan the Panthan) makes for a satisfying hero, and Tara of Helium  fills the bill quite nicely for a damsel in distress.<br />The heroes are  noble, the villians are wicked, thecause is just, and the action is  nonstop.

John Gollon, a noted authority on chess  variants, had a similar experience when he was writing &quot;Chess  Variations.&quot;  He thought he'd include a chapter on jetan for some  comic relief, so he made a jetan set and played a few games.  He found  jetan &quot;quite good--very playable and interesting.&quot;  He then  pronounced jetan &quot;not a mere novelty, but ... a respectable  game.&quot;<br />These two singular achievments (Ghek &amp; jetan) are not the  only details that make &quot;Chessmen&quot; so enjoyable.  Gahan of Gathol  (aka Turan the Panthan) makes for a satisfying hero, and Tara of Helium  fills the bill quite nicely for a damsel in distress.<br />The heros are  noble, the villians are wicked, the cause is just, and the action is  nonstop.

Most judges I've been before feel that you ought to be able to control a witness without judicial intervention.<br />Iannuzi's suggestions for note taking during direct examination provide a workable methodology for the fledgling advocate.  users of this system will likely get writer's cramp, however.

He finds one in the person of Sherlock Holmes, a rather odd individual who displays astounding depth of knowledge in some areas and abysmal ignorance in others. Despite (or perhaps because of) his uneven education, Holmes displays acute powers of observation and deduction. Watson also finds Holmes to be a talented boxer, fencer, and violinist who conducts noxious chemistry experiments and entertains strange guests. Watson is mystified, but being too polite to ask blunt questions, he unsuccessfully tries to deduce what the devil his new friend is up to.<br />All becomes clear when Watson is called on to assist Holmes as he solves a murder mystery which completely baffles Scotland Yard. The story moves quickly to the inevitable capture of the \\"bad guy,\\" and then through a lengthy flashback sequence we discover the \\"bad guy's\\" motive. Next we return to the \\"present,\\" where the story draws to its satisfying conclusion.<br />Thus begins a crimefighting partnership that Conan Doyle took through four novels and fifty six short stories. And long after Conan Doyle put down his pen forever, the parternship continues to thrive in countless theatrical performances, radio plays, movies, and literary pastiches.	2000-07-08

Remembering a few of the teachings in that book, I struggled through that cross and several more en route to a favorable jury verdict.<br />The first two years of my law practice, I read &quot;The Art of Cross Examination&quot; once every three months, and I profited from each re-reading.  Wellman gives a wealth of basic practical advice, gives it in an engaging fashion, and illustrates it with entertaining stories.  When you read it, you may find some gender references which we &quot;enlightened&quot; moderns would describe as &quot;politically incorrect,&quot; but try to remember that the book was written a century ago.  Despite the fact that it's beginning to show its age a little, this book is THE classic commentary on cross examination.  Nowhere else can you find such good instruction at such a low price.

Thus, per Connelly's analysis, Napoleon blunders into one potential disaster after another and snatches victory from the  jaws of defeat only by scrambling brilliantly.  Probably a more accurate  assessment would be that Napoleon's confidence in his abilities and his  troops made him willing to take enormous risks.  When things went awry, his  mental acumen and military ability usually carried him through to victory  in spite of his overweening audacity.  The book is an interesting read.	2000-07-07

He drew up plans for the invasion and then died.  Phillip appointed the Duke of Medina Sidonia  to lead the invasion, and thus set the stage for one of the greatest naval  disasters of all time.<br />Some might argue that the venture would have  turned out differently had the more capable Don Juan been in charge of the  expedition, but Don Juan won his victory with galleys on an inland sea,  whereas Medina Sidonia met defeat in galleons on the high seas.  Howarth  gives a catalog of problems, minor disasters, and inadequacies which  Chester Nimitz might not have been able to overcome.<br />The Spaniards had  inferior Naval Doctrine, inferior ships, inferior cannon, inferior  ammunition, and they were taking the battle to the English.  Add to this  some abominable luck, and they faced an almost insurmountable challenge.  The English were inferior only in numbers, and they were fighting for their  very existence.<br />Howarth gives a compelling account of the disaster from  the germ of Don Juan's idea to the final landing of the defeated survivors.  He critiques the Spanish effort fairly and insightfully.  Anyone  interested in the history of the Invincible Armada would find this book  helpful.	2000-07-07

Unlike the Simon &amp; Schuster  collections of tales from the Bruce/Rathbone era, this collection presents  12 consecutive tales in chronological order of presentation.  Also, unlike  the Simon &amp; Schuster presentations, this collection dispenses with the  pre- and post-story commentary.  With the extra tape, they present three,  rather than two, stories per cassette.<br />Every third story is an adaptation  of a Conan Doyle story, so the quality of those stories is superb.  When  Meiser is left to her own devices in writing, she can produce very uneven  work.  &quot;The Case of the Well Staged Murder&quot; makes for satisfying  listening, but &quot;Professor Moriarty and the Diamond Jubilee&quot; is  quite contrived, and &quot;New Years Eve in the Scilly Isles&quot; is  downright silly.  A firebug is seen deserting a ship as it sails out of  harbor.  The Captain is radioed that the ship will probably go up in smoke  at the stroke of twelve on New Years Eve.  The lives of 2,000 passengers  and crew hang in the balance.  So does the Captain turn around and go back  to port to unload the passengers and search for the time bombe?  Nope.  He  sails on for 18 hours until he is far at sea and there is only an hour left  until midnight.  But Holmes arrives in a yacht just in the nick of time.  This has my vote for the most contrived Holmes radio pastiche of all  times.<br />John Stanley sounds more like Rathbone than Rathbone, and doesn't  muff his lines as often.  Alfred Shirley tries manfully, but he cannot  quite convey the warmth of Bruce's Watson.  The organ music is more subdued  and not quite as annoying, but Meiser makes Holmes far too disagreeable.  He is the rudest Holmes I have encountered, and very nearly the most  conceited.  I'm sure that on several occasions, the only thing that  prevented Watson from inviting Holmes outside for fisticuffs was the fact  that Holmes was an expert amateur boxer.<br />The 60 page booklet that comes  with the collection is a gold mine of information for Holmes afficionados.nly thing that  prevented Watson from inviting Holmes outside for fisticuffs was the fact  that Holmes was an expert amateur boxer.<br />The 60 page booklet that comes  with the collection is a gold mine of information for Holmes afficionados.	2000-07-06

Between the wars, the Marine Corps developed a  theory for making them work.  They tested and refined this theory in the  bloody crucibles of Tarawa, Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Pelileu, and Iwo Jima,  with their magnum opus being Okinawa.  Success came at a high price, and  Alexander pulls no punches in describing the horror.<br />As a teenager, I  once expressed the opinion that it was wrong to drop The Bomb on Japan.  My  father, a veteran of the Third Marine Division who saw combat at  Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima, quickly informed me that I would never  have been born if The Bomb had not been dropped.  The Third Marine Division  had been chosen to spearhead the amphibious assault on Kyushu, an isle of  the Japanese homeland, and my father sincerely believes that he would not  have survived the assault.  Alexander dissects the plans for that invasion,  and sums up the anticipated carnage.  The assaults from Tarawa to Iwo Jima  had this in common. Each was bloodier than the last.  Kyushu promised to be  a mini-Armaggedon.  We can never really know what the bodycount would have  been had The Bomb not been dropped.  From Alexander's description of what  was expected to happen at Kyushu, one could make the case that the death  toll would have been much, much higher, both in Japanese and American  lives.	2000-07-06

The battle may not have  been quite as decisive as all that, but European history would have been  quite different had the Spanish lost.<br />This book gives a readable account  of this turning point in history, as well as a rousing account of, not only  the battle itself, but the Seige of Malta, which served as a prelude to the  battle.<br />That Lepanto was the high water mark of Spanish naval  accomplishment is all the more remarkable in that it preceded by only a few  years the debacle of the Invincible Armada.	2000-07-06

Many  historians consider the Knights to be the first practitioners of nursing.  They could crack their enemies' skulls and then expertly apply the  bandages.  Nursing, however, was not their greatest contribution.  After  the collapse of the Crusading movement, they became Europe's Mediterranean  bulwark against Turkish expansion.<br />When they were expelled from the Holy  Land, they set up on the island of Rhodes, and weathered two concerted  efforts by the Turks to dislodge them from the island.This, then is the  story of those two campaigns, and it describes them in all their gallantry  and savagery.<br />They finally succumbed to the might of the Turkish Empire,  but were able to retire from Rhodes in good order.  After being dislodged  from Rhodes, the Knights moved to Malta, and there withstood another epic  seige which served as the prelude to the decisive Battle of Lepanto.  Their  efforts truly helped to save Europe from Turkish domination.  All in all,  this is an entertaining and informative history of a pivotal period in  European history.	2000-07-06

I assume this volume is a reprint of that memorial edition.  I read all the Holmes  stories as a child and have revisited them again and again as an adult.  The stories are generally engaging, well crafted, and satisfying.<br />Watson,  Holmes' Boswell, is an excellent story teller and a good, solid man of  action, someone you'd want at your side in a difficult situation.  His  intellect is good, although not of the first magnitude.  Holmes does not  cut as pleasing a figure.  Although he is vain, arrogant, and just a little  strange, his powers of observation, superb application of logic to the  detection of crime, and many other talents (boxing, fencing, chemistry,  etc.) make you willing to forget his vanity.  As a state prosecutor who  sometimes becomes involved in the detection of crime, I have had occasion  to apply some of his maxims of crime detection.  My favorite, and one which  has served me well over the years goes something like this: &quot;When you  eliminate the impossible, then whatever is left, no matter how improbable,  is what must have happened.&quot;<br />Doyle really didn't like writing  Sherlock Holmes, so he peremptorily killed Holmes off halfway through the  series.  The resulting clamor from Holmes' fans was so great that after a  hiatus of several years, Doyle began to publish &quot;reminisences&quot; of  cases Holmes worked before his death.  Eventually, in &quot;The Return of  Sherlock Holmes&quot; we discover that Holmes really survived the attempt  on his life and was merely &quot;laying low&quot; for a time.  The  adventures resume, but the quality of writing after his return was never  the same.  Some wit observed that Holmes may have survived the attempt on  his life, but he was never quite the same afterwards.<br />Even when Holmes is  not at his best, he's quite good enough to outdo any of the modern mystery  detectives.

Keep the auxiliary exercises to a  minimum.

Delbruk argues that there was no such thing as cavalry during the Middle Ages, and until the coming of the Swiss phalanx,  not much in the way of infantry.  Simply putting an armed man on horseback  doesn't make him a cavalryman any more than handing a weapon to a peasant  makes him an infantryman.  Cavalry was a disciplined group of horsemen  fighting as a unit.  Mounted knights were an undisciplined group of  horsemen fighting as individuals.  A troop of cavalry should be able to  defeat an equal number of knights, but a single knight defeats a single  cavalryman.  For a good description of what the military aspect of mounted  knighthood was all about, read Delbruk's description of the encounter  between two knightly armies at Pillenreuth.  That alone is worth the price  of the book.<br />Delbruk doesn't stop with a description of the military art  of knighthood.

Delbruk gives an excellent explanation of the gaps  and argues that the Romans closed the gaps before meeting with the enemy.  His explanation flies in the face of most other scholarship, but it has the  virtue of making sense where other explanations do not.<br />Delbruk doesn't  merely parrot what he's read in other works.  He engages in thoughtful  study, and his conclusions, while often unconventional, are always well  reasoned.	2000-07-01

He published  this last volume of his masterwork in 1919, but he ended his study of  &quot;modern&quot; war with the wars of Napoleon and the scholarship of  Clausewitz.  &quot;What followed,&quot; he wrote, &quot;included in the  phenomenal rise of Prussia and its final collapse will have to be  undertaken later by others.&quot;  Perhaps it was too painful, or perhaps  he realized that he was too close to the events to be able to give an  unbiased analysis.  Whatever the reason, had he undertaken to write he  would surely have made a valuable contribution to the military scholarship  of World War I.<br />As he had done in his three previous volumes, Delbruk  again gives a fresh, insightful analysis of the dawn of modern war, but in  this volume he also gives good studies of some of the early practitioners  and theorists of the the early modern era.  (E.g., Gustavus Adolphus,  Cromwell, Machiavelli, and Clausewitz).<br />Delbruk, having proclaimed in  Volume III that cavalry didn't exist during the Middle Ages, gives a lucid  account of how cavalry came to replace chivalry.  Delbruk adds an  interesting commentary on the matter of cavalryman versus knight when he  describes knightly encounters with cavalry during the Huguenot wars.  The  French knights hated discipline and pistols, considering both things  unchivalrous.  Their enemies' lowborn cavalrymen disdained neither, and  consequently the French knights repeatedly experienced the agony of defeat.	2000-07-01

Calvin Morrison of the Pennsylvania State Police goes out to arrest a killer, stumbles into a lateral time machine, and falls suddenly into the feudal princedom of Hostigos, which is not in another world, but right in  the middle of Pennsylvania.  Hostigos, ruled by a benevolent prince with a  beautiful daughter, faces the short end of a war of extermination. Morrison  has a chance to display his leadership ability, utilize his knowledge of  military history, rescue the princedom, and wed the princess (who could  never be mistaken for the stereotypical damsel in distress).  But can he do  it before he is hunted down by the Paratime Police?  He did, after all,  manage to shoot a Paratime Policeman when he stumbled into the lateral time  machine.<br />Piper explores the ramifications of alternate universes and  parallel time lines, and makes good use of his knowledge of Renaissance  military science in crafting a fast moving, entertaining novella.

Howard, they enlisted the aid of L. Sprague DeCamp and Lin Carter to polish Howard's grammar, soften his more &quot;politically  incorrect&quot; statements, and fill out the saga with pastiches.  This,  the last of the stories, is 100% pastiche, but it still has the flavor of  Howard's barbarian.  I first read it as a teenager, but now that I have  passed the half century mark, the story has new resonance.  In this  adventure Conan anticipates George Foreman by several millenia.  He may be  old; he may not be the man he once was; but he can still outmuscle most  foes, and those he can't outmuscle, he can outfox.  At the conclusion of  the book you might just get a little misty-eyed when Conan ends his  adventure and sails off into the mists of time, never to be heard from  again.	2000-06-30

He analyzes the reasons for the success and the  causes of the ultimate failure of the Crusades, and therein lies a lesson  for modern times.<br />Runciman speaks of the many causes of initial victory  and ultimate defeat, and catalogs the grievous injuries to all concerned  resulting from the Crusades.  His analysis is sobering, and some of it is  not inapplicable to the current state of affairs in the Middle East.  The  Crusader States were looked on by the native Moslems as interlopers to be  driven into the sea.  That final victory was achieved, but at what cost?  Given the fiat accompli of the First Crusade, and the centuries of  existence of the Crusader States, couldn't they have achieved a modus  vivendi which, if not completely satisfactory to either side, at least  allowed the parties to live in harmony without doing further mischief to  each other.  If all sides of the current conflict in the Middle East would  read this book, it might expedite the peace process.	2000-06-30

The story was the tale of \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\"<br />In \\"Tarzan\\" Burroughs displayed his total ignorance of Africa and his inability to recognize ridiculous plot twists. His first draft populated Africa with tigers (changed to panthers in later editions), and it abounded with impossible situations. Tarzan taught himself to read by staring at the pages of some books he found. Later, when he had occasion to write a note to some European interlopers into his domain, he signed his name to the note and gave it a correct phonetic spelling. Now how could he possibly know how to spell in a language he had never before heard spoken? Even as a child of 12, I could see the inconsistencies, improbabilities, and impossibilities of the story. Nevertheless, I read the book straight through at one sitting. Revisiting it as an adult, I could still enjoy the action-packed story.<br />Fortunately, Burroughs got better as he added to the corpus of Tarzan books, but he was never able to write a story completely free of improbable plot twists. Despite its shortcomings, \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" is must reading for any Tarzan fan. Remember, Burroughs did get better as he wrote more stories.	2000-06-30

Hero languishes in a mundane workaday world.  2. Hero, by magic or science, is fantastically transported to a wondrous world where  magic works.  3.  Hero encounters strange situations and remarkable  characters.  4. Hero embarks on quest, rescues the damsel-in-distress,  defeats the forces of evil, and saves humanity. One example of this formula  is DeCamp and Pratt's &quot;Incomplete Enchanter&quot; series.<br />&quot;The  Dragon and the George&quot; follows this formula to a T, but the result is  one of the best examples of the type.  One nice touch is that the magic in  this new world is treated in a most non-mystical way:  It must follow laws  as strict as the laws of physics, and it can never run afoul of the  Accounting Department.<br />Dickson uses this vehicle to explore the nature of  courage, friendship, and loyalty, and each of the protagonists displays  these attributes in varying degrees and varying ways.  To save his friends,  Aragh faces the hordes of sandmirks alone and with two broken legs.  Weak  and cowardly Secoh screws his courage to the sticking point to help the  crippled Smrgol face the powerful young Bryagh.  Dafydd the archer calmly  assumes the near-impossible task of shooting down a horde of harpies.  Jim  Eckert recovers from the blue funk induced by a near-death experience to  lead his friends into the almost certainly fatal final battle.<br />Dickson  writes a story in which the most fantastical of characters seem as real as  your next door neighbor, and you come to really care about them.

It is florid, overblown, and full of circumlocution.<br />Some of the plot twists can only be described as bone-headed.  Two examples:  The  protagonists engage in a song fest while trying to hide in woods crawling  with hostile Indians.  They search for a fort by following the rut plowed  by a cannonball.<br />Notwithstanding its flaws, &quot;Mohicans&quot; is an  engaging tale about remarkable people whom the reader comes to care about.<br />In the Leatherstocking Saga, Cooper anticipates Edgar Rice Burroughs'  Tarzan stories.  Both Tarzan and Hawk-eye are noble men from  &quot;civilized&quot; stock thriving in a wilderness among  &quot;savages.&quot; Cooper and Burroughs both do violence to the English  language, both write contrived plots with improbable twists, but both  nevertheless spin tales of wondrous adventure.<br />One scarcely noted aspect  of the story is the undercurrent of racism and tribalism that permeates the  tale.  Every Indian tribe seems to hate every other tribe; whites hate  Indians; Indians hate whites; and so on ad nauseum.<br />Magua tells Cora he  hates her because she is white like the man who sold him whiskey and caused  him to disgrace himself.  Cora defends herself:  &quot;And am I answerable  that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist, whose shade of countenance may  resemble mine?&quot;  Ironically, Cora, on her mother's side, is  &quot;descended ... from that unfortunate class who are so basely enslaved  to administer the wants of a luxurious people.&quot;<br />When Munro accuses  Heyward of preferring his (Munro's) daughter Alice to her half-sister Cora  because of Cora's Black ancestry, Heyward replies: &quot;Heaven protect me  from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!&quot;  No sooner does he express  this noble sentiment than he shows great relief to learn that Alice's  mother is Scottish on both sides of her family.<br />Then there is the  trans-racial partnership between Hawk-eye and Chingachgook, in which some  critics see the prototype for the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover partnership in  the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series.

The plot is well-constructed, the characters engaging, and Holmes is refreshingly humble.  The story's  only real flaw is that it suffers from a somewhat obvious solution--a  shortcoming of many of the Boucher-Green collaborations.  &quot;The Paradol  Chamber&quot; on the other hand is as contrived and silly a piece of work  as one could hope to imagine.  In Boucher's and Green's defense, you must  admit that Conan Doyle, who only wrote 56 Holmes stories, wrote several  stinkers himself.  Boucher and Green cranked out over 200 stories, and they  did it on a much tighter schedule than Conan Doyle worked against.

The idea that John 21 was the original ending to Mark rather neatly solves the problem of why Mark ends so  abruptly.  Mark's ending was transferred to John to help &quot;smooth  over&quot; the differences between the two gospels.  Powell's arguments for  the primacy of John are good, but they fail to carry the day.  Mark doesn't  appear to be written in answer to anything.  It appears to be written by a  man who simply wants to tell the story of Jesus in a language which is not  his native tongue.  If either of the gospels appears to be an  &quot;answer&quot; to anything, it is John.  John takes great pains to  elevate the &quot;beloved disciple&quot; over Peter, an indication that  Peter occupied a highly respected place in the early church and that the  author of John might have harbored some resentment of Peter. Regardless of  whether you agree with Powell's conclusions, you can appreciate his  scholarship and the cogent arguments he makes to support his views.	2000-06-25

Larsen's book served as the basis for the TV miniseries starring Mark  Harmon and then fell out of print. &quot;Stranger Beside Me&quot; had  better legs and remains in print to this day.  This book's success comes  from Ann Rule being a better writer who wrote from a better perspective.  Although Richard Larsen also knew Bundy personally, he was not as close to  Bundy as Rule apparently was.  Factually, the book appears about as  accurate as any other of the plethora of Bundy books, but all these books  suffer from a common failing:  wittingly or unwittingly, they tend to  glamorize a sadistic, brutal recreational killer who really was no stranger  than any of the other &quot;serial killers&quot; who captured the headlines  of the last half of the 20th Century.  This alone separated Bundy from the  pack: he was an articulate pretty boy.  If you feel you really must read  about such a monster, this book is about as good as any of the other Bundy  books and probably better than most of them.	2000-06-25

The organ music gets  monotonous, and if I weren't already a teetotaler, the wine commercials  would make me take the temperance pledge.  Despite all that, the  productions are wonderfully entertaining.  Basil Rathbone's Holmes exceeds  Clive Morrison's overacted Holmes as the day exceeds the night.  The  chemistry between Bruce and Rathbone is perfect, and the simple stories  move swiftly to their satisfying (if somewhat obvious) conclusions.  Although Holmes purists tend to hate Nigel Bruce's Watson, I found him to  be irresistably likeable.

It was a test of a pragmatic method of warmaking against a traditionalist method.

His critiques are comprehensive, but a little too dismissive of the scholarship of others.  He gives a thought  provoking analysis and makes a good argument for chess as a descendant of  an ancestral version of Xiang Qi, the modern Chinese game.  He's a little  too skeptical of authorities positing an Indian origin for chess and a  little too accepting of authorities finding a Chinese origin of chess.  His  greatest false step is his argument that chess migrated from China to  Persia, skipping India.  He cites to no historical documents supporting  this contention and ignores the Persian tradition that they got chess from  India.  The best section of the book is his comprehensive description of  ancient Xiang Qi variants.  Li's argument doesn't quite carry the day in  proving a Chinese origin for chess, but it does cause one to be more  accepting of the idea.

Pritchard does his best work when he is describing the many historical and  regional variants of chess.  Two regional variants are described in detail,  Chinese chess (xiang qi) and Japanese chess (shogi).  Chinese chess may  actually be played by more people than orthodox chess, and Japanese chess  may very well be a better game than orthodox chess.  If you are interested  in the history of chess, its ancient and regional variations, and the odd  lengths to which human imagination can go in modifying the game, this book  is for you.	1999-06-04

It can be a hard read in places, but it's well worth the  effort.  The section on Shogi (Japanese Chess) gives an introduction to a  game every bit as deep and satisfying as Western Chess.	1999-05-21

I first read this edition of the &quot;Jugurthine War&quot; back in the late 60's at the  height of the Vietnam War.  I found the similarities between Vietnam and  the Jugurthine War to be striking. The U.S. military could well have  studied the lessons of this book. Aside from that, Sallust's story of  Jugurtha is a rollicking good yarn with intrigue, corruption, hairbreadth  escapes, betrayal, remarkable battles, and central characters (Jugurtha and  the Romans opposing him) who, each in their own way,  are all remarkable  men.  The other half of the book, &quot;Cataline&quot; deals, not with a  guerilla war, but with an abortive coup.  It deals with some of the same  human values and has some characters who are almost as interesting as the  characters in  &quot;The Jugurthine War&quot;.	1999-01-17

E.B. Sledge's &quot;With the Old Breed&quot; told of valor,  sacrifice, suffering, and savagery through the eyes of one man.  &quot;Iwo  Jima&quot; gives a vast panorama of those things.  We see the battle in all  its horror, but we also see the good accomplished from the terrible  sacrifice of so many men.  The book gives a balanced, comprehensive account  of a bloody page of American history.	1998-10-19
