(Until now that is!) In some ways this book was what I expected, but in other ways not what I expected at all. I was surprised at how racy and frank it is in regards to sexual activity - especially since the book was published in 1932! I'm surprised it wasn't  more scandalous than it was upon its release in 1932.<br /><br />So many different aspects of this book could be commented on...I'll focus on one. In regards to ###, birth control and reproductive technology - this book was incredibly and amazingly prophetic!<br /><br />Remember that in 1932 birth control was just about non-existent (expect for natural methods and animal intestine condoms.) Sexual standards were much more conservative than today. (Compared to modern day statistics: Living together outside of marriage was almost unheard of, the divorce rate was very low, illegitimate births were rare, etc.) And ### still had much stronger ties to pro-creation than to pleasure. Abortion was not only illegal but a scandalous thought to most people. And, of course, reproductive technology was still many years in the future.<br /><br />Yet, in Brave New World, we see a world where women are either sterilized or on birth control. In the rare case it failed, they go to the \\"abortion center\\".  ### is purely for pleasure and promiscuity the normal standard of behavior.  (\\"Everyone belongs to everyone\\", and having only one ### partner is thought of as strange and bizarre.) And humans are created and raised in a laboratory.<br /><br />It is incredible how quickly our society has slid from 1932 to the present day! This is one reason some conservative people then (and today) are opposed to birth control.  They see the pandora's box it can open... Birth control (and the back-up option of legal abortion) makes sexually loose standards a possibility, and reality! We are already living in the Brave New World. Aren't people in our society today - who believe in sexual abstinence before marriage, and ### being only for marriage - thought of as narrow minded, unrealistic, old-fashioned and even a bit strange?<br /><br />Aldous Huxley even commented on this in the new forward for the book that he wrote in 1947. (He comments how, in 1932, he saw the scenarios in Brave New World unfolding in 600 or 700 years in the future. But writing in 1947, he thought we might actually see these things by the end of the century.)  In regards to ### and marriage: \\"Nor does the sexual promiscuity of Brave New World seem very distant. There are already certain American cities in which the number of divorces is equal to the number of marriages. In a few years, no doubt, marriage licenses will be sold like dog licences, good for a period of time, with no law against changing dogs or keeping more than one animal at a time...\\" (page xvi in forward)<br /><br />When one looks at the present statistics for co-habitation, marriage and divorce in this country, and the debate over what marriage even stands for....Whoa!! Brave New World was shockingly prophetic.<br /><br />Too prophetic for its own good. It was a book ahead of its time. Most of its reviews in the 1930's were negative...because it was just seen as crazy and too \\"out there\\".  It's too bad more people didn't take it seriously. We have slid very quickly into a moral wasteland...y - who believe in sexual abstinence before marriage, and ### being only for marriage - thought of as narrow minded, unrealistic, old-fashioned and even a bit strange?

Books	5	12	13	N	N	much needed indictment of lukewarm American Christianity	This book is a short, easy read...but is challenging at the same time.   It is a much-needed indictment of evangelical Christianity in America.  Our faith does not seem to be influencing our everyday life.  Statistically, evangelical Christians are involved in just as much sin as non-believers.  In fact, according to the book, sometimes the behaviors/attitudes of evangelical Christians are actually worse than the world! <br /> <br />How can this be?  The author gives various ideas and possible solutions.  For instance, too often we present a one-sided gospel.  We only emphasize God's forgiveness and love.  And fail to mention the importance of repentance and obedience in the Christian life.  There is \\"cost\\" in being a true follower of Christ.   We need to start preaching a more complete gospel message.  We also need an increased emphasis on accountability, within denominations and among individuals.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I actually bought two copies - one to keep and another to give away.  I gave the other copy to my pastor.	2005-07-13

He was actually a professor (and political representative) that went to Peru to increase his knowledge about South American history for teaching purposes. He decided to go back with a team of experts to try and find the lost city of the incas.  And he did find it! It is great \\"adventure\\" reading...hiking through jungles, steep and dangerous terrain, exploring a long forgotten (and uncharted) area of Peru.     He also shares a lot of history about the incas in the book. We \\"owe\\" a lot to them.  For instance, they domesticated/cultivated some of the common agriculural foods we still eat today. And they domesticated the guinea pig. Your kids can thank the incas for their furry little pet!    If you are considering visiting Peru and Machu Pichu, I'd highly recommend this book. It is a great starting point to learning more about this country and culture.	2005-07-11

I approached this book with a skeptical and critical spirit. (Too many \\"seeker sensitive\\" churches water down the truth in an attempt to reach people. And they end up with shallow church members that are lacking in genuine Christian faith.) However, this book really softened my critical spirit. Some of my opinions were based on misconceptions and misunderstandings. I was impressed by Rick Warren's reasoning and ideas.     What surprised me the most is the high expectations of his actual church members. (And members must re-new their membership once a year.) If members don't meet the expectations, they are dropped from the membership roll! The book said that 500 - 700 people a year are dropped from the membership roll for failure to meet expectations. How many churches today do that??!! Very few!! Too many churches today have inflated membership rolls that include people who only show up for church once a year! There seems to be almost NO membership expectations at many churches today. And if there are expectations, they are not enforced in any way.    He admits that there are many people at Saddleback whom he refers to as \\"the crowd\\".  People who are curious and attending some of the time (seekers!) but they have not yet made any commitments to Christ or to the church. He differentiates between members and \\"the crowd\\" - the expectations for both are different.    Saddleback has very specific plans/programs (classes, small groups, etc) for \\"growing\\" people from new Christians into mature Christians.  And for \\"moving\\" people from just being \\"attenders\\" to being actively involved in the church.    In general, there is much more accountability, and higher expectations that I ever imagined a \\"seeker\\" church having...In fact, Saddleback has higher expectations and accountability that most \\"non-seeker\\" churches I am familiar with!    Despite Saddlebacks large size, I was impressed by how they manage to genuinely care for people, keep aware of their personal needs, and be there for them.  They have a number of methods for maintaining this personal touch.     Although I don't agree with everything in this book, it really gave me a new perspective on seeker-sensitive churches.	2005-06-18

I was pleasantly surprised by it. It is an easy-reading book that offers unique \\"think outside the box\\" ideas for solving a variety of church problems. Even if you are NOT thinking about building, many of the ideas in this book may be useful to your church!    Most churches probably don't need to build because there are other very viable and realistic alternatives. (The book gives many examples!) A building may also put the church in financial bondage, and shift the churches focus from people/outreach to the building program.  Because the focus changes, the church stops growing...and they end up in a big new building with hardly any people.     Besides the actual physical ideas for creating more usable space in your existing building, the book also encourages you to think more about your churches priorities and principles.  Maybe you don't even need more space. Is your church \\"over-programmed\\"?? Many churches start new programs without phasing out any of the old. Old and new programs may end up over-lapping with each other. More isn't necessarily better. It can lead to chaos, volunteers stretched thin, lower quality programs, and lack of space. Better to do less and do it well. Cutting out some programs may not only solve the space problems, but just be better for the church anyways!  Short on sunday school classrooms? The \\"team teaching\\" method described in the book will not only free up space, but it often creates a higher quality of sunday school classes.     I highly recommend this book - many creative ideas... I think all church leaders should read it.	2005-05-08

But the authors of this book tell the story of America in an interesting, compelling way. This book was extensively researched and is filled with well-documented facts, but it reads like a story - not a history book. I read the book with great interest and had a hard time putting it down.  <br /> <br />There is a strong emphasis on the Christian heritage of our nation. In a modern age where many want to \\"erase\\" the Christian roots from our history books, it was refreshing to be reminded of the powerful influence Christianity had on our nation's beginning.  <br /> <br />However, I am not quite sure I completely agree with the author's interpretation of events.  In a Calvinistic type of way, they are trying to prove that it was God's plan for America to become a nation. We were pre-destined to be a great nation, therefore nothing could change or alter our historical course. They explain everything that occurred in our history in a \\"See, that's why this happened, it was God's plan\\" type of style.   While I can agree that God is in control and that it may have actually been God's plan - the authors take it a little too far somehow. <br /> <br />Regardless, I give this book a very high review.  It is a detailed and factual review of our nation's history but in a very \\"readable\\" style.  I'll probably read this book again.	2005-04-29

After hearing about this book for several years, I finally decided to get a copy. It's message needs to be heard by more people! When children and teenagers are picked on, teased, ridiculed, laughed at, made fun of, and tormented... the emotional wounds can go very deep. Some people just don't get it...they think that \\"picked on\\" kids just need to toughen up, and be less sensitive.  Easy to think if you were a nice average kid that was rarely or never picked on... But imagine being \\"not average\\" in some way (having a disfiguring birth defect, having a speech impediment, having buck teeth, being painfully shy, fat, skinny, freckled...). Kids can be cruel. And the wounds can last a lifetime.    Frank Peretti shares his own personal story of being born with a rare and disfiguring health condition that led to years of torment from his peers at school. His response was to retreat into a world of fantasy - he was obsessed with monsters and monster movies. (1950's and 60's era). Thankfully he had a loving family, and a Christian faith that helped sustain him too. (For Frank Peretti fans, this book is a great mini-biography of his life!)    But the pain and inner rage felt by someone who has been mercilessly picked on can release itself in unhealthy ways. As he points out in the book, the teenagers responsible for Columbine were teens that had been picked on and mistreated at their school.  They were time bombs waiting to go off, and they \\"went off\\" on that fateful day.    The book gives practical, constructive advice on what to do if you are currently a child or teenager being picked on... And it is also a rallying call for adults to step-in and stop bullying when they see it taking place. (It's amazing how so many adults can just stand by and do nothing when they see a child being tormented by his peers!)  The strong should protect the weak. Our entire perspective about the value and worth of individuals needs to change. We are all precious in God's sight!      There is an emphasis on the importance of forgiveness. If we don't forgive those who have hurt us, we will only become bitter. The \\"wounded spirit\\" in us will never heal unless we forgive. And we also must seek the forgiveness of those we have hurt. If we are honest, we too have caused emotional pain to others...    More people should know about this book in general - as it is an issue that affects us all. But consider giving a copy to school teachers, sunday school teachers, and others that work with kids/teenagers - Bullying is not normal. Picked on kids can be emotionally wounded for life. Those who work with kids need to learn how and why to take a stand for the \\"different\\" kids in their class.	2005-04-10

I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.  This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain. (I guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways?) In it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River.  Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed.  The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river.  The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.  Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such. It is written in typical Mark Twain style - his dry sense of humor will bring a smile to your face. I really enjoyed this book.	2005-04-05

Northanger Abbey is a paraody that \\"makes fun\\" of the gothic type novels that were popular at that time.  Ann Radcliffe and some of her writings are mentioned by name in Northanger Abbey.  So...off I went to find out more about Ann and get one her novels.  <br /> <br />Ann was really the first gothic writer and set the scene for the other gothic writers that followed her in the late 1700's and early 1800's. Another reviewer accuses her of copying the novel The Monk - but it is actually the opposite. The author of The Monk copied her! <br /> <br />Anyhow...I loved this book! Vivaldi and Ellena fall in love but Vivaldi's mother is against the match because Ellena is not from a \\"proper\\" family.  The mother and a monk initiate a plot to keep them from marrying each other. I don't want to say much more, because there are so many interesting plot twists that I don't want to give anything away. It is a great story line that keeps you guessing.  There is romance, suspense, mystery, intrigue, evil villians, evil plots, creepy landscapes, and more! <br /> <br />It is a long book that took me several weeks to read but was more than worth my time!  <br />	2005-03-12

I loved the idea of it!    But I read only a few chapters of this book and decided to stop reading it. Perhaps it is unfair for me to write a review since I did not read the entire book, but enough was enough.     Call me a prude. Call me old-fashioned. Call me what you will. But this is a trashy book. It is filled with cursing: all versions of the \\"f\\" word, frequent profane use of the name of Jesus Christ, and much crude, vulgar slang and references. If books were rated like movies, this would be a definite rated \\"R\\".     Jane Austen books do, of course, portay immoral situations and other seedy sides of life. But the issues were handled \\"delicately\\". The immorality was viewed as shocking and inappropriate. The immorality was certainly not described in detail. Her writing had refinement and class. Things were proper. I would think that a modern re-write of a Jane Austen story would at least maintain this same perspective.      But this modern re-telling has no shame! I felt like I had descended into a gutter. Jane Austen would roll over in her grave to see such a trashy, vulgar, crude book published as a re-make of Pride and Prejudice.      Well, I must sound like a raving lunatic... and no one will probably like my review. But I am just being honest.   The idea and basic story line for this book was a good one, but it is unfortunate the author had to make it so crude. If Jane Austen were alive today, I know she would have more class than this...	2005-02-16

And I hate to give anything by any of them a bad review. (I've debated between giving it 2 or 3 stars.) But I do not care for Villette at all! I got to page 282 and basically decided  to stop reading it...I did skim some parts to the end to get an idea of the ending of the book.    This book was like one long plateau. I kept wondering when \\"something\\" would happen. There were a few mild climaxes, but nothing significant. I felt like \\"ho-hum...will this story ever get going?\\"  And then the ending was so disapointing also.    I thought all the coincidences (people from the past suddenly running into each other) was just too unrealistic. I know this is fiction, but it just seemed too contrived...    I realize this book is semi-autobiographical, and Charlotte had just lost her entire family to consumption. So it is understandable this novel is so flat...it reflects her dark mood. But...it still doesn't make for a great book. There is so much ordinary detail and feelings expressed in the book that it almost made me feel like I was reading a journal or diary. And this \\"journal\\" should have been better edited to create a more exciting novel!  There are some good ideas, and I think this novel could have been so much better...    If you do get this book, make sure you get a copy with the French translations in the back. Or you will get lost by some of the dialogue. Unless you speak French, of course.    Maybe I am just lacking in deep literary analysis - as so many consider this book to have such depth...Maybe I read it with the wrong expectations. Yes, I probably did...but I just didn't care for this book.	2005-01-27

She is making fun of some of other gothic books that were in circulation at that time. The main character gets a little too obsessed with gothic novel reading, and imagines a sinister plot in the abbey becasue her imagination is out of control.  <br /> <br />This book is much more juvenille than Austen's other books.

So I read it as an adult.  This powerful book is the personal diary of a 13 year old girl who was in hiding in an attic (for 2 years) during the Holocaust.<br /><br />If you are in Amsterdam you can visit the attic that they hid in - it is now a museum. I toured it, and what shocked me was how very small the area was that they all lived in...(The diary described their small living quarters, but it didn't seem real to me until I saw it for myself.)  As per Anne's diary, it was very challenging and frustrating for a group of people to live in such close quarters. They had to be quiet and still during the day (when other people were in the building), but at night they could move around a little more freely.<br /><br />I also visited Bergen Belsen in Germany - the concentration camp where Anne and her sister died. There is a special memorial to them there.<br /><br />Anne was just a young girl and parts of her diary are about silly \\"young girl stuff\\"...And parts are a little dull because it is just about the everyday routine of life in the attic. But, overall it is an exceptional first-person account of what it was like to be Jews in hiding during WWII. As you read, you can relate to Anne's fears, struggles, hopes and dreams...dreams that were never fulfilled because of the horror of the Holocaust. I recommend this book to students and adults alike.	2005-01-19

The author gives practical advice on how we, as Christians, can overcome our weaknesses through the power of the Holy Spirit.   <br /> <br />I like the \\"practicalness\\"  of the book about how our temperament can affect our relationships, employment, marriage, sex life, etc.  This book helped me understand myself - I have a very melancholy temperament type. I was laughing at times because the descriptions in the book sounded so much like me it was uncanny. Sometimes people with these traits feel ostracized from society in different ways. It was encouraging for me to learn that I am not alone... <br /> <br />Approach this book with the right expectations, and I really think you will enjoy it. <br />	2005-01-17

But to fully appreciate this book requires that you be a \\"mature\\" reader. And also realize that this book was written in another era, where society and standards were much different than today.<br /><br />I originally read this book years ago for my highschool literature class. Although I didn't dis-like the book, I didn't exactly like it either. It did not have much of an impact on me. I think I was too immature (lacking in life experiences) to relate to and understand some of the strong emotions and the complex sides of human nature portrayed in the book.<br /><br />Reading this book years later as a mature adult, I was deeply touched by the story of Jane Eyre. You experience a variety of emotions: abandonment, despair, love, romance, mystery, danger, heartache.  And Jane Eyre was really a character ahead of her time - Although content to conform to the standards expected of a woman in her time period, Jane had an independent mind and spirit. She would not do something against her will, heart, or conscience. She was not afraid to speak her mind. She had strong Christian moral beliefs and would not waver from them. She is a heroine to be admired and respected.<br /><br />So much more could be said, but I will leave it at that. If you were disapointed by Jane Eyre if you read it as a teenager, try reading it again as an adult.	2005-01-15

I am generally not into pop psychology, self-help books, etc...So it was unusual that I picked up this book at all. But the description of the book sounded so much like me that I had to read it.     While I don't agree with some of the advice in the book...What I liked best about this book was simply that it was a positive pep talk for people who have HSP traits. There are good and beneficial things about our traits! I have gone through life feeling ostrasized by others because I am quiet natured and introverted. \\"You're too quiet.\\"  \\"You're too serious.\\" \\"You're anti-social.\\" ...On and on it goes.     People on the opposite side of the spectrum (light-hearted, talkative people...) are not criticized like this - I am not saying they are never criticized, but not nearly as much as we are. Our Western culture simply does not value our traits.    If nothing else, this book was simply an encouragement to me. I am not alone, others have traits like me, and although there are downfalls (which we can learn to deal with)- there are many positive aspects to being a quiet and introspective person.     I think HSP has some similarities to the the melancholy temperament type. The ancient Greeks identified 4 basic temperament types. (For an interesting book on the temperament types, read \\"Why You Act the Way You Do\\" by Tim Lahaye. It is from a Christian perspective just so you are aware. And it's not a \\"scholarly\\" book either, but just an \\"easy-reading\\" book about temperament types.)	2005-01-15

I've been trying to read more classic literature recently. And Wuthering Heights was really worthwhile. Yet I find myself almost at a loss for words in describing this book.  This gothic romance was a very intense read...and I felt almost in another world as I read it. It creates a \\"feeling\\" that remains with you long after bedtime!<br /><br />The main characters Heathcliff and Catherine are larger than life somehow. How do you describe their dark and stormy love? It is a deep love that descends into obsession, despair, and revenge. Typical of gothic literature, the brooding and haunting landscape of the moors somehow seeps into the characters. And seeps into you... My words can not do this book justice. My advice? Read it!	2005-01-13

She eventually left the Catholic Church, but this book is not anti-catholic!  <br /> <br />She emphasizes the difference between religion and relationship. Religion is something \\"to do\\" (sing in the choir, light candles, do good deeds, say certain prayers). There is nothing wrong with religion and it is certainly good to do these things! But religion is worthless if we do not have a relationship with Christ. Christ is someone to know and trust in a personal way.  The author was unable to find this relationship with Christ within her Catholic environment. <br /> <br />However, she emphasizes that the same thing could happen to someone from ANY religious background. It does not matter if you are a religious Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, or Catholic...You must ask yourself: Do I have a relationship with Christ? Have I placed my personal faith in Christ?  Your faith must be in Jesus Christ, not in your religion. <br />	2004-12-09

It is the other side of the story. Please consider reading it.     This book is written by the victim Debbie Morris. She takes you through her life (before and after the crime) and how she went on after being the victim of such a horrific ordeal.  She ultimately found peace by forgiving Robert Willie. The parents of another girl that had been victimized and murdered by Robert Willie were the opposite of forgiving - they were filled with rage, hate and bitterness. The contrast between Debbie's response and their response really stood out to me. Debbie found peace and they did not...    This book also gives a different perspective on Robert Willie than the one given by Sister Helen Prejean in Dead Man Walking. Debbie portrays Willie as being the one in control. He was domineering, the leader, and heavily influenced his partner in crime Joe Vaccaro. In Prejean's book, Willie is portrayed rather the opposite!!  (Should we be surprised that someone on deathrow might not honestly describe themselves?)       Overall, this is a well-written book about the power of a forgiving spirit. Please consider reading it to get both sides of the story of Dead Man Walking.	2004-12-08

This book is also the only thing I have read about her, so my opinion of the job this book does in presenting her life (in comparison to other works) is limited. Although the book is very detailed (some parts were a little hard to get thru...) I overall thought it was well written. I did not find it lame at all!    I greatly enjoyed this book! Some call her the female version of Lawrence of Arabia. Her life was a grand adventure in many ways. She was intelligent, college educated, and fluent in many languages. She refused to conform to what was expected of a typical Victorian woman, and went off boldly traveling.  She became an expert on Arabia, even traveling into areas where no white man had gone, let alone a white woman!      Her first-hand expertise on Arabia landed her a job with the British government during WWI.  Although as a woman she got no credit (your average person has never even heard of her!) - the information and analysis she provided guided much of the policy that was developed on Arabia. She herself drew the map that divvied up Arabia into countries. (Hmm...she is really responsible for some of the problems that exist over there.) She attended the Cairo Conference in Egypt after the war. And had much to do with the formation of Iraq. In fact, she is sometimes called the \\"uncrowned Queen of Iraq\\".     However, her life was also very tragic. One of the only men she ever truly loved - her father refused to grant his permission for her to marry him.  This devastated her, and the man actually died soon after this refusal.   She was lonely... Often isolated, and discriminated against in various ways because she was a woman in a government position. She was also an atheist with no spiritual faith to guide or help her. In the end, she committed suicide. A tragic end to a life that was truly a bold and grand adventure!	2004-12-07

After all these years it is still in print, so that should tell you something! Peter was a hippie disillusioned by America. He decided to set out on a literal walk across America with nothing but his backpack and malamute dog to keep him company. There are, of course, ups and downs to his journey - times of loneliness, sickness, danger, and peril. But he met many wonderful people. Some would surprise you - like a recluse mountain man who turned out to be friendlier than he thought, and a poor black family in the rural south who were very generous and welcomed him into their humble home. He even lived on a cult-like, alternative, free-love \\"farm\\" for while. Peter, at the end of his walk, had a spiritual awakening and his faith in America was re-newed. It is an inspiring story. But does not end here. The next book chronicles his walk west with his new wife!	2004-12-07

I admire and respect the author of this book - Rita Golden Gelman. And I hope she continues to \\"go for it\\"! A quick summary of the book - Rita got divorced and just felt unsettled/dis-satisfied in her routine upper-middle class life. So she started by taking a 2-month trip to Mexico. And this began what turned into 15 years of being a nomad - traveling all over the world. She had no permanent address! She traveled economically by the way. Often managing to live on 12,000 US Dollars a year.      Overall, this is a great modern travel story. But I did have two mild criticisms:    #1: I found some of the writing a bit choppy. (There seemed to be lots of short sentences.) Perhaps this is because the author only wrote children's books before this...    #2: I also don't agree with the author's \\"world view\\" (political/sociological) view of things. That is not a reason to dislike her or her book!  But I found she contradicted herself sometimes. For instance, she emphasized repeatedly (and I mean repeatedly!) that we must not judge another culture in any way.  And we should never attempt to change/alter another culture in any way.  We must observe only. But she herself was judgmental at times!     For instance, she usually tried to blend in to the culture she was in by speaking their language, eating their food, etc....But in Bali she refused to learn the local language because the language was steeped in the caste system. (Just talking to someone in the language would involve having to speak \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" to them.) Rita says in the book that she did not want \\"to go around insulting people\\" so she therefore refused to make any attempts to communicate with these people in their own language.  I would say this is definitely passing judgment, and making a pretty strong statement to these people that she disagreed with their caste system!!     Rita seemed inconsistent in applying her belief that \\"we must not judge\\". Whether she \\"judged\\" or not seemed to depend on the particular issue that was involved...    My \\"world view\\" is different...Yes, cultures should be allowed to maintain their basic beliefs and systems. However, there are standards of right and wrong in the world. Sometimes a judgement must be made... If a practice is barbaric or dangerous, something needs to be done to alter it. (A recent example that comes to my mind is the infamous Taliban of Afghanistan that was grossly mis-treating women.)     But I have digressed! ...I really did enjoy this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes modern travel stories.	2004-12-07

It is designed to be read through like a regular book. In an \\"easy reading\\" style,this book provides a detailed overview of just about all of the eschatological issues in the Bible. It is from a strong dispensational viewpoint. Some of the topics are what you would expect...the book of Daniel, Zechariah, the Olivet Discourse, the nation of Israel, etc.  However, I learned some new things about the prophecies of Balaam and Jacob.    This book really helped unify the various prophetic themes of the Bible in my mind. It helps you see God's unified plan for the world as it unfolds through the Word of God. After you read it,you'll still want a copy around that you can reference.  Although written for the layperson, to read this book does require a decent working Bible knowledge and some familiarity with Bible prophecy. Otherwise, it might overwhelm some people.	2004-12-07

I'm a nurse, and reading a Jewish Doctor's first-person account of life in Auschwitz was horrifying, shocking, disturbing. The squalor and filth alone (in the ward for the sick) was horrifying.  Something I remember from the book was that Auschwitz was very large, and some people in parts of Auschwitz did not know (or refused to believe) that Jews were being murdered. Imagine being right in Auschwitz and not knowing this...It is disturbing that human beings are capable of such great evil. But that is the hard truth. The Germans were methodical in their documentation of what they did...so how people can deny the holocaust happened is ludicrous. The book isn't about that, but it is a compelling narrative on the horrors of life in Auschwitz...Read it.	2004-12-06

But I did enjoy it none-the-less. The author takes many of the key stories from the Bible and re-writes it as one chronological and unified story. Not every story or person from the Bible is in the book. It is based on historical and Biblical truth, but the author personalizes it by weaving in emotions, personality, and filling in the \\"blanks\\" in some of the lives of Biblical characters.  Some of his \\"re-tellings\\" stay pretty close to the Biblical account, but others are much embellished. <br /> <br />I think someone unfamiliar with the Bible who wanted a \\"story like\\" reading of its basic stories and themes, would find this book helpful. It might be a non-threatening way to be introduced to the Bible. (But, of course, it isn't the Bible!)  People already familiar with the Bible, might find this book gives them a fresh look at many Bible characters.  It might give them a re-newed interest in getting out their Bible and reading it.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-06

I have read many stories of the holocaust from the perspective of the concentration camp.  But never a story like Jack and Rochelle's!! They escaped from the ghetto and hid out it the woods during the war. (Small groups of Jews banded together in the woods.) Sound idyllic? Their existence was horrific, dreadful, and desperate! They were often reduced to being like animals. If a woman arrived pregnant, no one wanted her in their group - a baby is noisy and would be too risky.  (If the woman was accepted into the group despite her pregnancy, she was forced to kill her newborn or someone in the group killed it for her.)  Jewish women, who were alone and did not find a group of Jews to join, often had to perform sexual favors to find someone to take them in or help them.  (Cruel and heartless Russian partisans were the worst offenders!)  Despite the absolute horror of this true story, the story of Jack and Rochelle is inspiring. They met in the woods, and survived - overcoming great odds. They later married and came to the USA. The book is also well-written, and is an \\"easy read\\" in regards to the writing style.	2004-12-06

The basic beliefs of the dispensational system were known to me from my upbringing. And I wanted to read this book to learn more details about the system and go a little deeper.     (On a side note, it is ironic to me that so few Christians seem to have heard of dispensationalism - especially since so many of them believe in the pre-trib rapture, pre-millenial return of Christ, and a literal millennial reign. Or so many of us \\"grew up\\" with Scofield or Ryrie study Bibles and teachings. Dispensational interpretation is the foundation of these beliefs! Right?)    This book is a challenging read for your \\"everyday\\" person. But I got through it, and absorbed more than I thought I would... It is an apologetic primer on dispensationalism. The book builds on itself - the early parts simply explain the basics of the system, and then there are responses to the various criticisms of the dispensational system. It seems to me that some critics of dispensationalism exaggerate and have not really taken the time to properly understand the dispensational position.     Since reading this book, I've also tried to gain a better understanding of Covenant/Reformed theology - the opposite side of the evangelical spectrum. I think both sides have the unfortunate tendency to mis-represent or exaggerate each others beliefs. I'd urge critics of dispensationalism to read this book by Ryrie - I think you will gain a more accurate understanding of dispensationalism. And for lay people who want to go a little deeper, don't let this book scare you.	2004-12-06

It is divided into three sections: life before, life during, and life after the holocaust for Jewish survivors. All the accounts are first-person narratives by the survivors themselves. I believe they were all interviewed on tape for a documentary. And then they put it into print to create this book. Something that surprised me was how prevalent anti-semitism was in the years before the Holocaust. Sometimes we think Hitler suddenly arose out of nowhere with his anti-semitism. But he was actually just \\"riding a wave\\" of hatred of the Jews. The Polish people were in particular very hateful of the Jews. It really surprised me how much they had to endure before WWII even began! This book was a compelling read - true accounts directly from those who survived the greatest horror of the 20th Century.	2004-12-06

More people should know about it!! Pastor Trocme was the leader of the resistance, and much of the book is about him and his family.  He was Pastor in a little Protestant town in France, and he and his townspeople saved the lives of hundreds of Jewish children.  <br />However, I think the book could have been better written. I hesitate to recommend the book to others because I think they would have a hard time getting through it. The story is fragmented. It is not really told chronologically. Each chapter tells a different part/aspect of the overall story. By the time you finish reading the book, the different parts of the puzzle have come together...but its telling is not smooth. <br />To give the author some credit, he did have a challenging job to write this book so long after the fact. He had to piece together many pieces...through research, reading old diaries and letters, interviewing the handful of still-living people involved in the story, etc. But I still think it could have been \\"put together\\" in a better way.  <br />Perhaps someone should write a shorter, less-detailed narrative about this town - that way it might have a wider reading audience. Again, it is an incredible and inspiring story that needs to be told! <br />	2004-12-06

This long but well-written book takes you through the life of Billy Graham. I couldn't put it down and read it over about 2 weeks despite its length (700 plus pages!!). Some reviewers say he is arrogant for \\"dropping important names\\" so frequently. But these are just the plain and simple facts. Billy Graham had incredible opportunities to preach all over the world and met many important world leaders and figures. He was (and is) highly respected by just about everyone, and has managed to remain a humble and simple-living man. He doesn't hesitate in the book to admit when he made a mistake in judgment or should have handled a situation differently. He and his main ministry assistants kept very high standards of accountability among themselves.  Much of the book focuses on his crusade ministry and world travels. But in the final chapters of the book, he does get more personal and mentions some of the problems and challenges there were for his family because he traveled so much of the time. Long but worth the read!	2004-12-05

It is more of a history book. It's a compilation of different legends and lore from the first ages of Middle Earth. Parts of it are rather &quot;dry&quot; (boring) to read, but many parts are very interesting! For instance, I loved the long chapter about the romance between Beren and Luthien. By reading The Silmarillion, you gain a much deeper understanding of the LOTR trilogy. There are many names in the book - so many that I could not keep them all straight. I frequently had to look up names in the dictionary in the back of the book - in order to remember who someone was... <BR>Approach this book with the right perspective: It is a history book for the serious LOTR fan. If you are someone who just has a surface or temporary interest in LOTR because of the movies...then you will likely not enjoy this book.	2003-11-01
