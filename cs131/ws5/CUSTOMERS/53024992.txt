Instead O'neil's &quot;How to Make Money...&quot; is what you should be looking at.  Consider this a guide to investing principles as applied to using Investor's Business Daily.  If you keep that in mind you'll stay happy reading William O'Neil's latest book.  You'll draw out useful nuggets and basic investing principles, but most of all, you'll better understand how basic principles well help you get the most out of IBD.<br />The book is written in a basic interview approach-- someone probably asked questions and then recorded the answers over a period of years.  That makes the volume consise and very easy to read.  In fact, you'll barrel through it in no time.<br />If you are relatively new to IBD, you need to read this.  And, if you are a new subscriber you've probably received a copy with your subscription!  If you didn't-- with patience, over time you can read through the book as it is reprinted chapter by chapter in the paper itself.  O'Neil does this from time to time.<br />Someone in another review said this book is a giant advertizement for the Daily.  No denying that-- but rather than seeing the comment as a criticism, look at it as a worthwhile suggestion. If you are considering getting into investing, I'd strongly recommend Investor's Business Daily as one of your first steps toward starting your learning curve.<br />And, if the book isn't included with your subscription, then be sure to pick it up at the same time.	2001-08-04

The volume looks through the lens of social history, work ethics, civic associations, professions, classes, and many more perspectives to create a definition of civil society (or &quot;middle class&quot; as Clowes, West and Kassow choose to identify it in the title.)<br />For those of us attempting to make sense of what is occuring in Russia today, it is critical to take a long hard look at its past. And, that is just to start the road to understanding.  I  recommend this book to the hard-core Russophile or anyone wanting to build a historical literature review of Russia.	2001-05-15

You will truly enjoy her perspective of women from the earliest days of the Kievian Russ through the Soviet Union.  She dicusses political dynasties, cultural and social norms as well as offering a valuable introduction into each period of history.<br />Especially interesting are her descriptions of little known women of influence and authority rarely spoken of in traditional histories, beginning with Grand Pricess Olga in the 10th century.  She provides a somewhat contrary view of Catherine the Great compared to other Russian histories that tend to whitewash her atrocities with trappings of the Enlightenment.  She offers equally thought provoking treatments of women through every era.<br />You will find this a refreshing and revealing volume.  I encourage you to read it.	2001-05-12

I stumbled onto this during my last trip to Vilnius and was completely pleased to see it now available here in the U.S.  It follows the style of something you might see published by Time-Life.  As with other books published in Lithuania, you will want to grab this one while you can.  Printing runs tend to be small and sporadic at best.  It is truly excellent.	2001-02-23

My introduction to Robert Massie came when I first picked up a copy of Nicholas and Alexandra last Spring.  Frankly I was expecting a serious history book-- In other words I expected it to be dry, dry, dry!  What a great surprise to find I could not put it down.  Having that great experience made it a no-brainer to read Peter the Great as well-- it was even better.<br />Massie's gift is in his ability to write history in a narrative style, identifying the nuances of each setting and character as well as the heros and antagonists, all while maintaining historical accuracy.  No wonder we find that Massie's works have been converted into both film and mini-series.<br />His account of the succession of Peter to Regent Sophia's intrigues is heart stopping.  You see directly into the private and public life of this unique Tsar who attempted to drag Russia into the modern era- The good the bad and the ugly.  It is simply great stuff!<br />If you are interested in Russia, start out with Peter the Great and go on to Nicholas and Alexandra. These are both excellent books!	2000-11-30

Well... not quite.  It is a suspense novel set in Moscow where the CIA station chief has been killed in what appears to be the Mafia attacking a restaurant.<br />The book pairs unlikely allies (really unlikely) Ben Martin, a temporary assistant cultural attache and Georgian KGB captain Sergo Chanturia.  As the investigation progresses, stolen plutonium enters the plot and the possibility that Iraq will be on the receiving end to build bombs.<br />If you are a really informed Russophile you'll find some holes.  Generally though, you will enjoy the story.<br />Here are the problems.  To begin with, as you read, you never feel the characters speaking with a Russian accent.  What I mean is their identities haven't been constructed enough that you can see it in their actions or hear it in their voice.  If you compare it to Gorky Park, you'll know what Im talking about.  Martin Cruz Smith did an incredible job building in the Russian attitudes, actions, reactions, etc.  In Moscow Twilight you just never feel you've arrived in Russia.  In fact, you could probably change the location, the characters and it would fit nicely in the US, Spain or anywhere.  In my mind I hear all the characters speaking in an American accent.<br />The other aspect is the lack of development in some of the plot variations.  For example Chanturia is a Georgian struggling with his Georgian identity and loyalty as the Republic struggles toward independence.  His involvements get him close to conflict there, but it never quite materializes.  He simple escapes it too easily.  Also the angle of the stolen plutonium had some promise to go further, but it never did.<br />In the end you have a novel about a murder without a lot of passion behind it.  You have to wholly accept a lots of premises (i.e. the KGB captain and cultural attache working together...) without asking a lot of questions.  Finally you have no more sense of what Russia is about then when you started, as opposed to Gorky Park where you have entered the Russian heart and soul as well as infrastructure.<br />It's a decent book, but not a classic. Look for it at a garage sale near you.t Russia is about then when you started, as opposed to Gorky Park where you have entered the Russian heart and soul as well as infrastructure.<br />It's a decent book, but not a classic.

Russia&quot; is for the . . .  Simple	Really-- a &quot;Simple&quot; Guide to Customs and Etiquette in Russia? No such thing is possible.  Russia is such a deep and complex society, the title puts me off now.  But... that wasn't the case when I purchased this booklet several years ago.<br />We were preparing for our first trip to Russia-Eastern Europe and were looking for anything that might offer some insight, so we picked this one up.  It's small, just a bit larger than a checkbook at 78 pages. I thought it would be useful and something I might want to toss in a jacket pocket.  The thing is, after finding our first really good travel guide, we've never opened this one again.<br />That's not to say there isn't good information in the volume.  Slatter talks a bit about the history and turbulent transition taking place in the context of who the Russian people are.  From there on out it mostly goes to the travel material.<br />The question you have to ask yourself now-- Am I going to depend on this book to get me around Russia?  The answer is simply &quot;no.&quot;  You will want, and need, another guide.  A good one will include everyrthing you might read in this booklet.<br />For a little more extensive treatment of the social-cultural topics, I'd pick up &quot;The Russian Way&quot; by Zita Dabars or better yet these travel books: &quot;Lonely Planet Russia, Ukraine &amp; Belarus&quot; or &quot;Insight Guides Russia&quot;.  &quot;Russian Way&quot; takes a similar approach to Slatter's, but expands significantly to more than 70 important topics.  Lonely Planet in my opinion prints the best of the travel guides-- you'll find everything that this book has, plus a lot, lot more.  Insight Guides are packed with great writing, information, plus hundreds of excellent photos.<br />With Slatters book out of print now, you might need to resort to that plan any way.<br />The bottom line--  &quot;Simple Guides&quot;  are for the . . .  Simple.	2000-09-23

McLagan's book is out of print now.  And no wonder, it addresses a small audience.  In spite of that, &quot;A Peculiar Paradise&quot; is a book that every Oregonian should read and should be included in every school library.<br />As an immigrant to Oregon in 1982 from an integrated neighborhood in Michigan, the first thing I noticed on arriving was what seemed to be the &quot;whitest&quot; state I'd ever seen. In the city of Medford where we lived for 5 years before coming to Portland, I'm sure there were no more than 5 black people in 40,000 during those first years.<br />If you want to understand why, start by reading this book.  Then go to the Library and dig into the Oregon Historical Quarterlies from the turn of the century.  It will confirm what McLagan shows: that Oregon almost entered statehood as a Confederate member.  Perhaps all that saved it from that was the fear of it's original southern pioneer settlers that a move to slave-holding would jeapordize their ability to compete economically (they had left the South for that reason).  Additionally, in the 1920's there were as many as 250 thousand Klan members in the state and at one point even a Klan governor was elected.  Well into the century, laws excluded blacks from owning land or even technically living in the state.<br />McLagan presents a view of Oregon history seldom seen. If you cannot find a used copy, be sure to check this one out at the public library.	2000-09-21

This little book is an eye-opener that every Christian in America-- black and white should read.<br />How many times have we taken for granted the children's Bible story books that completely dominate the Christian retail market with their little white Jesus, white Moses etc.?  The absolute truth is that Jesus and virutally every major major Bible character was a person of at least some color. You'll never take that for granted again.<br />McKissick is not delivering an political Afro-centric rewriting of history here.  He is simply following principles of sound Scriptural exegesis that confirm what biology would tell you about the origin of races.<br />Having done a substantial amount of advanced research on this topic myself, I will say that I support McKissick's conclusions fully-- There areindeed numerous generations in Jesus genealogy that include people of color-- black color... That to be the father of all races, the first families of Adam and Noah had to be families of color.<br />I strongly encourage you to read this book.  Also as a companion volume, you should look for Anthony T. Evans book, &quot;Are Blacks Spiritually Inferior to Whites?: The Dispelling of an American Myth&quot;.<br />There are some volumes presenting material and views that go beyond rules sound Biblical interpretation. McKissick's and Evans' are not among those.  They will dramatically affect your view of race in relation to the Bible and everyday life.  The bottom line-- after reading this book, you will know that Jesus is a Savior from and for all races, not just one.	2000-09-21

Don &amp; Katie Fortune's book, &quot;Discovering Your God-Given Gifts&quot; is a tremendous asset in the library of every spiritual seeker, server and leader.<br />There are a lot of &quot;gift&quot; books out there and as a teacher, I probably have all of them in our library. This one is great because it presents a clear case for how different lists of gifts serve their unique purpose in corporate worship and life.  It is easy to understand and share with others-- you'll want to go through it together in your Bible study group.<br />All of us wonder from time to time where we fit in when it comes to ministry gifts and service.  The Fortunes have hit it on the head when it comes to helping us identify our motivational gifts.<br />This book is especially useful for ministry teams, small groups and any setting where a variety of people have to relate or serve together.  The very first benefit of reading it, is the insight you'll gain to seeing how each of us in our gifts are needed to work together in balance.<br />Of course, the thing you will love about this are the surveys included that help you determine your primary and secondary motivational gifting.  I also recommend that you order directly from the Fortunes several of the supplemental tests that can be used with children, secular audiences etc.<br />You'll love it.  I give it my highest recommendation.	2000-09-21

Don't let that stop you from reading this book.<br />It had been sitting on my shelf for a long time when the &quot;jury duty&quot; call came.  Figuring I'd have a lot of reading time over my week of service, I turned my time into a personal retreat with Watchman Nee.  That week marked a dramatic change in my life.<br />Nee offers probably the very best ever explanation of the parables of the seed sown to &quot;die&quot; and the broken box of perfume.  It totally revolutionized my thinking of how the Spirit of God works in us.<br />Nee shares that our problem is we try to keep the life of the Spirit protected inside us all the while God is trying to shatter the shell to let it escape.  It was an incredible concept.  For me it changed the way I interacted with people we would normally shy away from.  Rather than being places where we need to &quot;shelter&quot; our spiritual life, Nee helped me to realize that is exactly the place a &quot;release of the Spirit&quot; is needed.<br />That is just one of the nuggets in this volume. If you are drawn to books like &quot;God Chasers&quot; and Dutch Sheets various titles, you will love this one.<br />This is a book I buy in volume to give away and so should you. It is simply a classic.	2000-09-21

Dr. Frank Snowden knows what he is talking about.<br />Snowden offers solid evidence from antiquity that does show &quot;racism&quot; based on skin color was in fact not a major issue of ancient times.  While it is true that slavery did exist from antiquity, it was based on conquest, and not skin color or race from a biological superiority/inferiority perspective.<br />Dr. Snowden is not writing a piece of revisionist history or unsupported political Afro-centrism, he is presenting findings of honest and credible research.<br />This is an excellent book that any intelligent person who has serious questions about race and racism in history should read.<br />One possible conclusion you may arrive at is that racism is evidently a much more recent social (and possibly even theological) construction in history and definitely not one that originated in antiquity.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Before Color Prejudice&quot;.	2000-09-21

In the 18th and 19th  centuries, some American anthropologists and theologians have attempted to rewrite Ethiopian history to show this advanced culture as one not truly black.  The roots of that go into the very heart of the origin of western racism in Colonial America and can be found to affect our implicit views of race even today.<br />Snowden shows from historical, textual and archaeological evidence that the Ethiopians were indeed a &quot;black&quot; race.  He also establishes their position of respect and complete equal acceptance with other ancient cultures of the time.  In essence, it shows, while perhaps not explicitly stating it, that racism is a much more recent invention than many have supposed-- especially those hold to a &quot;Black curse&quot; or &quot;inferiority&quot; theory in physiology or theology.<br />If you want a volume that presents evidence in a straight foward and empirically supportable manner, this is an excellent choice.	2000-09-21

Additionally she offers great tips for the situations one will confront in their cross-cultural encounters. You could think of this as a &quot;71 of the Best Things to Know About Russian Culture and Life&quot; book. You know-- the kind of thing airline magazines print in those crisp but colorful illustrated travel commentaries (&quot;The Ideal 10 Ways to Spend Three Days...&quot; or &quot;15 Fascinating Facts About...&quot;).<br />Dabar lists each of 71 items indexed numerically, followed by several paragraphs to pages of great material. Don't let the \\"Top-Ten-ish\\" approach dissuade you.  She obviously has given each one serious thought, telling us they all have been reviewed by Russians and other informed cultural veterans just to be sure she didn't leave out or misstate anything.<br />While her goal of bringing all of us to \\"Level III\\" of cultural awareness might be a bit of a stretch, we can say at least we've made a good start. All in all, it is a really good short volume.	2000-09-21

In John Channon's  version of Russian history, you'll find a concise, colorful and informative  collection of articles spanning Russia's origins, the Tatars and  establishment of imperial rule, through the Revolution, reforms and  restructuring of the 20th Century.  In a way it resembles something of a  compilation of articles from a good illustrated encyclopedia.<br />The appeal  of the volume is in it's size, illustrations and charts- I think of it as a  kind of annotated \\"table of contents\\" to Russian history.  It's a great  resource to get the basic synopsis of a period, person or event that you  can then take to a larger volume for greater detail. If you are looking for  a great coffee table book or in depth Russian history, this isn't it.<br />As  a neophyte to all things Russian, I found this to be the attractive  appetizer that inspired me to really delve into Russian history and  affairs.<br />While visiting a friend a few years ago in Siberia, he was  struck by the readability, illustrations and usefulness of my copy-- yes, I  brought it with me... He loved it so much, that I just had to leave it with  him when I left.  I now have purchased my second copy.<br />It's a great  little introduction to Russia.	2000-09-16

In one volume, is Jefferson's autobiography, travel  journals, essays, biographies of other historical figures, notes and  correspondence.  It is a wealth of material into a foundation stone  personality of our American identity.<br />Lately Jefferson has drawn fire  because of his position on slavery and his philandering activities as a  plantation owner. Still, within this volume you can observe the full story  historical context provides.<br />In my favorite passage in connection with  the slavery issue he writes,<br />&quot;And can the liberties of a nation be  though secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in  the minds of thepeople that these liberties are the gift of God?  That they  are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country  when I reflect that God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever;  that considering numbers,nature and natural means only, a revolution of the  wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation is among possible events; that  it may become probably by supernatural interference!  The Almighty has no  attribute which can take side with us in such a contest.&quot; (Notes on  Virginia, Query XVIII; p. 278 Modern Library Edition)<br />I think every  family should have a copy of this volume in their library.

Eastern Europe 2000)	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Details, but not much depth-- still, a decent travel almanac	The great thing about the &quot;Let's Go Easter Europe&quot; guide is it's  current-- A new edition out each year ensures you get the latest possible  travel information publishing deadlines allow.  But, before you spend money  on this one, I'd go to the local library to be sure it's what you  want.<br />This is a basic travel guide with a significant amount of details,  and a few exceptional articles, covering travel in the countries of Eastern  and Central Europe. Because you're talking 17 countries here, you are not  going to have a great deal of material in terms of background and history.  If you want to know what the area you're going to visit looks like, wait  until you arrive, because \\"Let's Go\\" doesn't believe in giving you any  hints there- the \\"only\\" photographs in 840+ pages are on the cover and a  couple of advertisements.<br />Another thing-  you'll find a \\"duplicate\\" set  of decent color maps for 4 major cities: Moscow, Prague, Budapest and  Krakow.  These are located on the front and rear sections adjacent to the  cover.  I assume that is so you can rip one out to take on the road with  you.  The rest of the countries have maps incorporated into the text (on  poorer quality paper).  The thing is-  with Eastern Europe, it's tough to  get a decent map at times. It would have been great if  \\"Let's Go\\" invested  in equally good ones for all the countries' major city.<br />Just in case you  need to know, here are the countries &quot;Let's Go&quot; addresses in this  edition: Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic,  Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania,  Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia.<br />All in all, I think  the book is useful, but not the best available.  I would not rely on this  book alone unless you on a limited business trip or a short overnight type  of stay or tour.  If you are going to spend the money to really visit some  of these incredible countries and gorgeous cities, find other<br />resources  to supplement your travel preparation.<br />Here are my recommendations based  on our experience:  First, if you are going to the Baltics or Belarus pick  up a copy of the &quot;In Your Pocket&quot; city guides. You can find out  more about these quarterly-updated guides by doing a simple web search to  locate their site. They are absolutely the best little guides! If you order  them, allow about a month for delivery.  Otherwise, when you arrive in a  city they review (i.e. Vilnius, Tallinn, Riga, Minsk etc.), pick one up on  arrival at the airport before you go.  They may be at a better hotels, but  often they are difficult to find once you leave the terminal.<br />Also I'd  recommend checking out the &quot;Insight Guide&quot; series for your area  of interest.  The one for the Baltics is superb.  They offer a depth of  great background and history with tons of photographs.

It was a great find.<br />Here is a travel guide written for  intelligent people.  There is a lot of great information and background  into the culture and history of various stops you might make. That is the  value of this book.<br />If you need up to the date information on hotels,  restaurants etc, this one is not going to work for you.  It is too dated at  this point.  Russia is a volatile country that changes daily. Luckily it  only gives a little bit of an overview of that anyway (if you want a hotel  list, get the Fodor's or Mobil).<br />One of the advantages of this book, is  the attention it gives to less traveled locals like: Tver,Yaroslav,  Kostroma, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladmir, Ryazan, Tula, Kaluga, Bryansk,  Smolensk, Pskov, Novgorod, Vologda, Arkhangelsk, Murmansk etc.<br />This will  be a good book for you to have.  At the same time, you need to pick up at  least one more.  I'd recommend the Lonely Planet travel guide.	2000-09-14

In Spring 2000 my  wife and I traveled to Papua New Guinea for a highland teachers conference.  This book was our companion along with Lonely Planet's Papua New Guinea  travel guide (highly recommended!)<br />This compact book (3.5 x 5.5 x 3/8's  inches) is small enough for a shirt pocket, but packed with the language  basics-- grammar etc. for 5 or 6 of the island creoles, and much more.  Each section contains a mini-travel guide for culture, history, business,  travel.  It also include a few basic maps.  The only drawback is the lack  of any kind of dictionary.<br />Pidgin is the people's language of PNG.  You  will actually be able to get along fine without a phrase book since English  is the language of tourism, education and business.  However, if you want  to get off into the highlands or another local area, this is a great  resource to talk to the everyday folks. As with most countries, a little  effort goes a long way in good will.	2000-09-14

Wow, Roger Williams has edited a wonderful book!  This travel guide is  much more than a basic Fodor's or Mobil type guide.  It is full of  beautiful full-color photographs-- I would say a couple hundred... In fact  every page has at least one  photo. \\"Baltic States\\" is printed on high  quality paper and reads much like a great pictorial magazine.<br />This is not  to say it is a light-weight when it comes to material. There is substantial  history and background included.  It's enough to satisfy your interest, but  not so much that it turns into an overbearing text book.<br />Equal  treatment is given to all three Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania.  It guides you though the must see attractions as well as  historical spots.  As I read it, I felt as though I had a person walking  side by side through the various sights.<br />Another thing I love is their  &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; format for the nitty gritty travel details at the  back of the book. You'll find all the basics you need to know that all the  other good travel guides would offer. Obviously they do this to make it  easier to produce new editions, as well as locating all the key facts with  an easy to use format.<br />This book receives my highest recommendation for  an incredible travel guide and addition to your home library.	2000-09-14

Languages can be almost  as frustrating.<br />If you are doing a little bit of travel in the 12  countries included in this 190 page phrasebook, you'll want to have this  one as your friend.<br />Langauges included are: Albanian, Bulgarian,  Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish,  Romanian, Russian, and Slovenian.  With this book you'll be speaking all of  them fluently in just a few hours! Just kidding  =)<br />The fact is, in one  place you'll have a bit of the cruical stuff you need to survive for each  language.  It skips all the grammar and goes straight to the words, phrases  and numbers.  Each section follows exactly the same format, so once you use  one, the others will be easier. Obviously, the size dictates utility (this  book is 4 x 5.5 x 3/8's inches).<br />Drawbacks? There are no dictionaries or  extras here, except for a regional map on the inside cover.  Additionally,  the pronuciation guide is located at the back of each section rather than  the front where most people that use phrase books would first look.  But,  Berlitz obviosuly felt the first thing you would need is the  &quot;words&quot; and then later the details of how to say them!<br />If you  are looking for a more extensive resource, you should pick up at least a  phrase book dedicated to each of the languages you are going to use.  If  you are going strictly &quot;tourist&quot; as in on a tour, this one will  probably do fine for you.	2000-09-14

This edition covers: Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek,  Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish.<br /><br />You are not going  to find the depth of material you would in another single language book (I  recommend the Lonely Planet phrase books as my first choice).  You will  find the basics compiled in a single format.  Once you learn how to use  one, it is easy to find the same items in the other languages. It is also  the same if you happen to pick up Berlitz's's Eastern European book as  well.<br /><br />There is not room for a dictionary and the pronunciation guides  are at the back of each section. I'm sure Berlitz felt the main reason you  would buy this was for the instant use phrases.<br /><br />If you want more than  this, be sure to purchase individual books for each language.  If you are  doing a tour, or only spending a few days here and there, you will be fine  with this multiple-language version for basic phrases and words.	2000-09-14

Actually, I love all &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; phasebooks and travel guides.  You can't go wrong with them.  These are the road warriors in our  collection.  They are worn, used and helpful! I want to own stock in Lonely  Planet!<br />So you ask, &quot;isn't there a later edition available?&quot;  Don't let that stop you. They are using a winning format and when it comes  to speaking at least Lithuanian, little has changed (Lithuanian is a  really, really, really old language!)<br />The book is concise and compact  (3.5 x 5 x 1/2).  It easily fits in any pocket.  That is a major selling  point.  It is the perfect size to take along.<br />It has an abreviated  pronunciation guide compared the single language versions and no  dictionary.  That comes form having to divide the space between three  languages, so it can't go as in depth. Still,all the essentials are here.  If you are planning a few days in each place, you'll be fine.<br />By the way,  when you go to the Baltics, look for a copy of the &quot;In Your Pocket  Series&quot; available at the airport or in the major hotels.  It will be a  great help to you.  You can also find it online through a simple web  search.	2000-09-14

As far as I'm concerned, the &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; series of  phrasebooks (and travel guides) are about the best.<br />This small guide is  packed with great stuff you can use starting with a simple pronunciation  guide up front. It's sections on grammar are great, incorporating phrases  most people would use in real life. The phonetic pronunciations for each  phrase are easy to read, accurate and intuitive.<br />Maybe the best thing is  it's perfect size, just a hair over 3.5 by 5 inches.  It will fit in a  shirt pocket or anywhere else for that matter.  Anyone that travels a lot  overseas will tell you that size, weight, and utility are the key issues  when considering anything you purchase to pack on the road.<br />Generally  we've found the Lonely Planet series to be the first we look for when  heading off to a new destination.  It will be a truly valuable asset to  your travels.	2000-09-14

I have to be  honest telling you this one is not as &quot;worn&quot; as our Lonely Planet  phrasebook (my first choice). In spite of that, it definitely has a few  great advantages.<br />The first difference you'll notice will be the addition  of maps of Russia, Moscow and the Moscow Metro.  If you are going to  Moscow, that in itself could be a lifesaver (I dare you to find a small map  anywhere on the street when you need one!)<br />It also incorporates a bit  more helpful material such as passport control info and a brief cultural  guide to each section- shopping, entertainment etc. The truth about  traveling in Russia is that you will have a tough time finding much help  once you get off the plane or train. The more you have thought through in  advance or have at your fingertips the better.<br />Another strong point is a  decent sized dictionary for a phrasebook.  The phonetic pronunciation guide  for each phrase is good as well.  This book is small, but not ideal at 3.75  X 6 inches and around 240 pages. The book isn't thick (3/8&quot;), but the  pages are tightly bound and a little difficult to turn.  You may find it  just a bit awkward to keep around at times.<br />This will be a good choice  for you, but honestly, this became our &quot;number two&quot; phrasebook  during our 7 or so trips to Russia and Eastern Europe in the past two  years.  It was just a hair too big to keep in my pocket and we constantly  opted for the Lonely Planet book instead.  The lack of wear it received  compared to the other speaks for itself.	2000-09-14

Hagen and Port Moresby last March for the first time.  What a great and beautiful country, and what a perfect travel guide to  orient you. While this book is nice enough to have on the shelf, ours is  worn from use... and usefulness. As a bonus, it's also well-written and a  great book to read!<br />Lonely Planet has again done a superb job combining  art, graphics, maps and information in exactly the right proportions. There  are a collection of excellent color and black &amp; white photos and  graphics. The history and cultural background is extensive owing to the  three experienced traveler-writers. They make great use of side-bars to  highlight special features and information (a trade mark of most Lonely  Planet materials).<br />All the regions are treated pretty equally and include  useful maps that otherwise would be tough to find anywhere.<br />If you could  only buy one book in preparation for your trip, you would not have any  problem making this your &quot;Bible&quot;.  It is also a great size at 5 x  7.25 x 5/8's inches and printed on high quality paper.<br />I will always look  to Lonely Planet as my first choice in travel books.	2000-09-14

In Havana Bay, Martin Cruz Smith delivers a fourth detective mystery based on the exploits of Arkady Renko, the Moscow chief investigator that cannot  leave any question unanswered. This time an enigmatic call for help brings  Renko to Havana where his former KGB nemesis Sergei Pribluda (recall Gorky  Park) is missing.  Again Renko assumes his role of protagonist as the  investigator no one seems to understand or wants to have on the  case.<br />Devotees of Renko will find all the literary devices they've become  accustomed to in the previous three novels- the resistant love interest,  antagonists that become unlikely allies and conspiring that reaches to the  highest level of intrigue.  There is no doubt that Smith is playing a  formula here, but that may be the secret of a great detective series.  Doubtless Arkady Renko could join with Sam Spade, Hercule Poirot among  others in starting a new generation of unlikely gumshoes.<br />As with Polar  Star and Red Square, Gorky Park is the logical and helpful prerequisite to  gaining the most out of reading Havana Bay. In this third sequel to Gorky  Park, Renko seems to arrive at a greater sense of himself, a little less  dark, a little more hopeful.<br />As someone that enjoys the moodiness, manner  and method of Renko, Havana Bay met all my expectations and became a  pleasant aside from the usual Russian environment the earlier novels were  set in.	2000-09-03

While it was  published in 1974 (renewed in 1981) and obviously is now out of print, for  several of the essays, this book is worth searching for.<br />It should be  noted that Solzhenitsyn is much more well thought of in the West than in  Russia today.  Even though he returned to live in Moscow, Russians  generally feel he left the country to profit on his message, so he is not  accorded the same kind of respect given to other dissidents that  remained.<br />Still, there are powerful messages here.  Personally, the most  impacting was Solzhenitsyn's chapter &quot;Repentance and the  Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations&quot; and Igor Shafarevich's  &quot;Separation or Reconciliation? The Nationalities Question...&quot;  In  these chapters the authors suggest that national &quot;repentance&quot; is  a key aspect to any kind meaningful social change.  The search for sins  begins in ourselves and progresses upward on behalf of the nation.  He  says, nations &quot;are suceptible to all moral feelings.. including  repentance&quot; (p. 109).  The nation is &quot;mystically welded  together&quot; in this way.  He further points to history to show the  nature of Russian character in &quot;penitental movements&quot; as part of  the national character that must be reclaimed to transform society.<br />The  message of the book is that national transformations must occur at all  levels but be built on a spiritual foundation.  It offers a critical view  of the roles of the church, socialism and personal conscience as obstacles  or conduits for change.<br />While the social and political nature of Russia  had dramatically entered upheaval for thepast 11 years (25 years after  these essays were originally penned), the messages are still relevant for  Russia today and equally applicable in many respects for our own country as  well.	2000-09-01

Morris' book joined our  excursion during a stop at the Roosevelt National Monument in North Dakota.<br />It immediately gripped me with brilliant vignettes from his childhood  and each stage of his life.  These childhood and adolescent views were my  favorite as Roosevelt became a person shaped by the pursuit of principles  and determination to overcome incredible obstacles.  If you need personal  inspiration in facing your own mountains, here is a life you can adapt as a  historical mentor even if your political or social views differ.<br />You can  almost here Roosevelt in the pages saying, &quot;These were the days the  politics was great fun.&quot;  Indeed, the volume convinced me that  Roosevelt loved to have fun.<br />You have my recommendation to add this book  to your library as one of the best Presidential biographies you might ever  own.	2000-08-31

How should the cultural plurality of our  country be viewed by a generally white European majority?  These are  questions that Dawson's book helped me begin to address.<br />I picked this  book up after the O.J. Simpson trial, which for me clearly illustrated a  culturally based difference in how races view each other and issues such as  justice and equality.  That moment troubled me deeply moving me to a time  of historical study and contemplation.  John Dawson's book came out around  the same period offering a spiritual perspective on something every person  claiming to follow Christ should consider.<br />You will not find a  comprehensive volume of research on race and racism here (if you want that,  try D'Souza's &quot;The End of Racism&quot;), but what you do find is a  spiritual message of confession and reconciliation presented by one of  America's leading Christian voices.<br />It is supplemented by some excellent  portrayals of little known events surrounding key moments in the past  centuries such as the Los Angeles Azusa Street Revival.  He emphasizes the  chacteristic breaking down of racial barriers in that revival that  occured-- only to be reconstructed as two distinct Pentecostal groups were  formed, one black and the other white.<br />Dawson calls us to fulfill our  &quot;redemptive purpose&quot; that God has placed in every culture, people  and nation.  That redemptive purpose is best approached through facing the  walls or divisions, identifying with sins-- present and past, confessing  them before God and men and then changing how we live.  A major sin he  deals with is our need to confess the endorsement and support for slavery  over America's history.<br />He concludes the book with a list of common  questions and responses such as: Do white people have to ask every black  person they see for forgiveness? Aren't all people really the same-- equal?  Aren't people responsible for their own actions-- why should we face  punishment for something our ancestors did?<br />I strongly recommend this  book as one of several for anyone considering issues of race and racism.qual?

Collected Essays and Notes, 1906-1989, with 209 illustrations	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Most comprehensive work on Mikalojus Ciurlionis to date	Stasys Gostautas offers a comprehensive edited introduction to and  analysis of Mikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis (1875-1911), the Lithuanian  artist and composer who is just now beginning to emerge in the arts  consciousness of the West.<br />Thiry-five essays invite you to get aquainted  with the enigmatic Ciurlionis: biographically, through the eyes of a  variety of contemporaries, as well as exploring Ciurlionis art and music  analytically and in the forces influencing his popularity or in the case of  the West, his obscurity.<br />Ciurlionis had a mystic-spiritual quality.  You  see it when mentioning his name to any informed Eastern European and  especially Lithuanians.  His work has a profound impact on the identity of  millions of people and in many ways his art and music define the Lithuanian  psyche and identity.<br />This book definitely offers our best opportunity to  date for the rest of the world to discover what Lithuanians have known for  over 75 years.<br />I would highly recommend obatining this book. As with  others that illuminate Ciurlionis life, they tend to be difficult to find  due to limited printing runs.<br />Another related great book you should add  to your wish list, but unfortunately is out of print right now, is  Lansbergis' &quot;M.K.

Martin Cruz Smith hit the nail on the head with this story. Not just your typical  spy-crime thriller, Gorky Park delves into the heart and mind of what it  meant to be a Russian approaching the era of new capitolism.<br />Renko,  investigating a grisly triple murder in the heart of Moscow's famous Gorky  Park, is certain he has stumbled into the work of the KGB.  He is the  prototypical man of principle awash in a compromising world, where the  rules change daily, power and influence corrupt on both sides of the  Atlantic, and pargons of virtue pose a threat to all.<br />I guarantee that  you will love this book and quickly continue on with the following three  sequels.	2000-08-31

In this version Arkady  Renko has paid the price of principle and is a man on the run east through  Siberia. We meet him in his ultimate hiding place, a &quot;slime line&quot;  in the bowels of a huge Russian fish processing ship working in joint  venture with the Americans in the Bering Sea.<br />Of course a murder brings  Arkady out of a year of obscurity into the light of day as the discredited  former chief investigator.  As with Gorky Park we are presented the man of  principle against people and a system that really doesn't want to be  challenged.  After reading Gorky Park, you can't help but wonder why Renko  tortures himself by obsessively getting deeper and deeper into the  investigation of a young woman's murder.<br />You will read this because you  have identified closely with the character of Renko.  The story also serves  to be part two of a lesson in Soviet thinking and and indirect commentary  of Western capitolism as Communism nears collapse.<br />I enjoyed the book  because of my interest in Renko and the hopes of finding out more of what  happened in the days following the conclusion of Gorky Park.  A little  disappointing was the derth of information of what was transpiring with  Irina, his Gorky Park love interest. If a person comes to this book before  reading Gorky, they will be somewhat lost.<br />You might also notice as I did  just how little dialogue the character Renko had.  He never really enters a  conversation, is constantly evasive.  While I understood that to be the  manner of the investigator's character, I found myself hoping he would just  sit down one time and really say something substantial.  Conversations  always start but are interupted.  You feel like if he could just one time  fully share his story their would be some form of catharsis and perhaps a  few more friends on his horizon.<br />If you have started into Gorky Park and  perhaps one of the other sequels, you have to read this one as well.
