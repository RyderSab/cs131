It is a little more than 50% text, with 31 illustrations (usually half-page or less) over 48 pages.  The line art pictures are detailed and could be colored or left alone; they are not at all baby-ish in their qualities.  The text is a reasonable abridged version that I think an above-average second grader might be able to read without difficulty, and would be appropriate for girls up to about age 12.   <br /> <br />The paper is relatively thick and high quality -- not at all like the cheap pulp/newsprint sort of coloring books that you find for 99 cents at the grocery store.  The binding is three staples, but since the book is large (8.25 by 11 inches), it will lay flat enough to color.  The cover is thick, glossy, and has full-color illustrations inside and out. <br /> <br />I bought two copies of this as a gift, to go with a copy of the original book, which will be too difficult just now for the children in question.  I had expected simpler drawings and only a very few lines of text, and had been wondering if I ought to buy an abridged book so they could read it.  Consequently, I am absolutely delighted to discover that this coloring book includes a simplified story with wonderful, beautiful drawings. <br /> <br />This coloring book is \\"not what I expected, but just what I wanted.\\"	2005-09-07

The second is factorials:  If there are three kingdoms in two countries on one island, then how many kingdoms are there altogether? <br /> <br />Imagining some of the silly scenes (there are how many cupboards in how many rooms?) is a delight.   <br /> <br />This book -- or at least the last half of it -- is best for kids who have been introduced to at least basic multiplication facts, but younger kids will enjoy counting and looking at the pictures even if the rest of it is over their heads.  It is, therefore, a great book to read to your middle/upper-elementary student while younger siblings are looking on.	2005-01-03

It stereotyped characters and preachy passages will keep it off the list of the all-time greats in literature, but chances are good that you won't regret reading it anyway. <br /> <br />The story line is fairly straightforward:  the loving, but poor, family is having its life turned inside out as the mother dies; the boy makes brief, but life-changing, contact with a worldly-minded, money-driven attorney whose wealthy family is crumbling from neglect. <br /> <br />The story is told primarily from the point of view of Robert Layton, the lawyer. <br /> <br />This is a three-hanky book; don't read it in places where crying will be embarrassing. <br /> <br />It is particularly recommended for people who have lost loved ones, especially around significant holidays, and healthcare professionals who care more about people than about the (admittedly important) scientific details.	2004-12-03

I love the descriptions of the preemies, the people who care for them, and the people who are affected by them.   <br /> <br />I really loved some characters (we get to meet lots of people in this book) and really loathed a few (particularly That Woman, who gets her spectacular comeuppance from the elephants -- you'll know exactly who and why when you get to that page!). <br /> <br />Both the science and the politics of the time are interesting.  The reason that the doctor \\"exhibits\\" the premature babies (most of whom have been abandoned permanently by their parents) is because there is no money to care for them in hospitals; the only way to pay for the nurses, equipment, and supplies is to charge visitors for tours of the sparkling clean, perfectly ordered, beautifully tranquil facilities.  <br /> <br />This is not exactly a historical work (although based on real history).  It is not exactly a love story, a figuring-out-life story, a mystery story, or an any-other-neat-category story.  It has at least some elements of all of these things, but is difficult to pigeonhole accurately. <br /> <br />Be prepared for a slow start -- actually, for TWO slow starts, as the story begins in two separate places, and it takes a while for the halves to meet -- and for a choose-your-own ending, since the author doesn't resolve everything neatly at the end of the book.	2004-12-03

The characters are less stereotyped, the plot is somewhat less predictable, and the preachy passages have been toned down.  Like the first book, it's also a tear-jerker, so keep the tissues handy.   <br /> <br />In this book, we see the eight-year-old, sequin-shoe-buying boy after fifteen years have passed.  He is now a medical student coping with life, death, and insecurities on rotation as a medical student in the hospital.   <br /> <br />It is not necessary to have read \\"The Christmas Shoes\\" to read this book, although I imagine that most readers will take the books in order.  <br /> <br />This book is recommended for anyone who enjoyed \\"The Christmas Shoes,\\" enjoys sappy, romantic stories, or the miraculous nature of everyday family love.  It might also be appropriate for students and others who are struggling with whether or not they have made the right choices.	2004-12-03

Change, as my dear husband noted, is morally neutral -- neither good nor bad in itself. <br /> <br />However, I think I prefer the older versions of _Etiquette_, in part because I loved Mrs. Kindhart and Mr. Gilding and Mrs. Oldname and all of the other marvelous people that populated the earlier books (pseudonyms for the friends to whom Emily Post dedicated the original 1922 book).  My old friends seem to have been ruthlessly murdered in the \\"modernized\\" version. <br /> <br />In addition, Peggy Post seems to countenance \\"innovations\\" that I believe the original author would have scorned, such as inviting \\"John Smith and Guest,\\" without bothering to find out whom your supposed friend is seeing these days and whether or not this is a person whom you would actually want to invite (your brother's ex-wife?  Your boss's wild daughter?  The employee you fired?  The potential is endless). <br /> <br />But beyond that, there is something missing in the style.  It carries the cachet of the time-honored Post name, but less of her wit and sparkle. <br /> <br />I think Emily Post may have had fun writing her book, and Peggy Post may have thought it uphill work -- or perhaps her writing was excellent originally and her editors created hash from it; at any rate, the writing style is less formal than I hoped (the informality subtly reduces its authority), and it sometimes reads like a committee bickered over each phrase, and occasionally like no one was particularly paying attention.  <br /> <br />So I am somewhat disappointed, but primarily because I adored the earlier versions; doubtless there are many who prefer the new version for exactly the reasons that I dislike it. <br /> <br /> <br />I also note on the author's website that the 17th edition was released on October 26, 2004, so perhaps if you choose to read a \\"modern version,\\" you will want to get the most recent.	2004-11-05

It is best for kids who have some idea how fractions work.  Some math problems are easy, and some are not so easy, so everyone can be successful at least part of the time. <br /> <br /> <br />How it has (or hasn't) worked in my own house:  I found Math Curse at the used bookstore and dropped it on the kids' bookshelf.  It stayed there for a long while until the four-year-old neighbor girl discovered it.   <br /> <br />She LOVES it -- vivid pictures, odd shapes, silly problems, offbeat style -- and I'm getting a little tired of it, perhaps because it's pretty challenging to read it in a way that makes sense to a four year old.  <br /> <br />Part of the challenge is that there is more on the page than the story; it's a stop-and-look-and-discuss-and-OH MY!  LOOK WHAT HAPPENED! book, and most of the math is beyond a four year old's immediate grasp, so after a while I find myself thinking with every page, \\"Do I read (and explain and explain and explain) this side bit, or do I give up on the Educational Value today and stick to the bare plot so that we can reach the end of the book before dinner time?\\" <br /> <br />It's an increasingly difficult decision, which I think reflects the fact that I'm getting bored with it after several dozen readings.  (On the other hand, reading this book isn't supposed to be \\"all about me,\\" so I've chosen to grin and bear it.) <br /> <br /> <br />This is a GOOD math book for kids aged 8 to 10 or so.  It will also read a LOT faster with anyone who knows anything about arithmetic and fractions. <br /> <br />However, as this book turns up very frequently in middle-elementary grade classrooms, I recommend that you think twice about buying it for home -- and teachers, if possible, I suggest you ask your students' prior teacher(s) if they read the book last year.	2004-10-30

I encountered this book as part of my sister's college courses.  I loved it; she struggled with it, but eventually grasped the point (and got an A+ on her essay, if memory serves). <br /> <br />But I was looking through the essays and comments by other reviewers, and I wondered -- Did we read the same book? <br /> <br />I didn't see a technophobic don't-read-it-online argument; I found an intriguing series of comments on what happens to when readers encounter something alien, and what happens to a culture when what used to be \\"normal\\" is now \\"alien.\\" <br /> <br />Were any of the rest of you forced to attempt Chaucer's Tales in the transliterated, but still semi-original Middle English?  Did you find it difficult? <br /> <br />The literary difference between Chaucer and 1900 is approximately the same difference between 1800 and now.  We've gained a lot -- you can have my Mac when you pry it out of my cold, dead fingers -- but we've also lost some things that we used to take for granted. <br /> <br />For example, have any of you slaughtered an animal for meat, or even watched someone else do it?  Have any of you used an outhouse every day of every year, because there wasn't an alternative?  Have you experienced the fear that comes with the knowledge that any illness or injury, no matter how minor, might kill someone?  Have you lived in a culture wherein a woman taking a walk at night, or traveling unaccompanied, was assumed to be having illicit sex?  (Think about the woman who marries Proteus at the end of Shakespeare's _Two Gentleman from Verona_:  Do you really think she would have agreed to marry him if she had any other choice?) <br /> <br />All of that was once normal.  It's not any more.  Our books have changed along with our culture.  <br /> <br />And just as I struggled through Chaucer, Sven Birkerts says that younger students are struggling through older classics like _The Scarlet Letter_, not because the Internet has made us stupid, but because our notions of acceptable sexual behavior and gender roles and family roles and all of the other things that make up \\"normal\\" have changed so dramatically that the situations and character responses no longer seem plausible to the modern ear. <br /> <br />(Can you imagine what an educated 1800's person would make of modern works?  They'd be as lost with a 2004 novel as the \\"media generation\\" is lost with an 1800s novel.) <br /> <br />For what it's worth, that's what I read in this book:  that what was understood for centuries as common cultural ground is no longer shared by everyone in our modern world, and, as a result, our literary heritage -- the surviving communications from ancestral generations to subsequent ones -- is less accessible to this generation than it ever was before. <br /> <br />I thought it was a good book, and I'd like to suggest that you read it, too, and see what it says to you.	2004-10-25

It's about the difficulties that modern students have with grasping older literature.  The reason for this is essentially that the world has changed so much in the last century that what was once common knowledge (farming, for example) is no longer common, and the once ubiquitous (and entirely Western) social code is no longer uniform.    As a result, characters from older books seem -- well, the usual student reaction to authentic period literature is \\"I just don't get it.\\"  It's not that the words are too hard; we just \\"don't get\\" the motivations.  Seeing characters act inside narrower cultural norms -- unable to rise above family and societal demands -- is as strange to the modern TV generation as a non-Western story might have been to a 19th century reader.     In this situation, _My Face to the Wind_ represents the compromise position.  The author goes to some trouble to present a physical and political setting that is historically accurate, but the key characters themselves have been \\"updated\\" to conform somewhat more to modern sensibilities.      For example, the central character is clearly an educated and well-brought-up 14-year-old, but she transgresses the social code when she directly asks the boarding house owner about her romantic past -- and even follows up with detailed inquiry when the older woman tries to deflect the issue.      Anyone familiar with the pre-Industrial Revolution social code realizes this would have been considered insupportably rude -- grounds for a serious scolding for \\"impertinence\\" at minimum -- but it works with modern students, because they have no idea that this was considered extremely bad behavior at the time.     The other problem that this work suffers from is the presentation as a \\"diary.\\"  Generally, the writing style of a diary is quite difference from a narrative work; it's more internal and reflective and self-referential.  One includes in a diary things that onewouldn't include in a narrative account, and vice versa.  Perhaps more importantly, one omits from a diary external events and details which are critical to a narrative.  I think that this book would work better as a series of letters; the epistolary (letter-writing) voice would feel more authentic.    I generally like the historical information presented in this book.  The prairie settlers get overlooked too often, and this helps redress that imbalance somewhat.  I do wish, however, that the publishers went to more trouble to make sure that readers understood that this is ENTIRELY A WORK OF FICTION.  In particular, the inclusion of an epilogue that purports to tell what the characters did in later life contributes to the illusion that this is \\"real.\\"    P.S.  One caveat for the gift-giver:  This story uses the occasional appearance of her father's ghost in unexpected \\"visions\\" to move the plot along.  Do NOT buy this for someone who will be offended by seance-like visions and unearthly communications from dead relatives.	2004-10-25

A falling-apart-at-the-seams copy of \\"The Dot and the Line\\" was in the first sack.   <br /> <br />It was SO wonderful and even funny -- at a time when it hurt to laugh!  The book is short (\\"little kid's book length\\") and you really feel for the line (and get rather disgusted with the self-centered squiggle) in those few pages.  The two-color, full-bleed illustrations are perfect and really add to the book's impact.   <br /> <br />I recommend the book for intelligent adults... and perhaps 10- to 14-year-old kids, if they are bright and independent (or if you want to encourage them to think critically about what it means to be \\"cool\\").	2004-10-24

It is more modern than most Alcott books in one respect: the heroine exactly doesn't &quot;get married and live happily ever after.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Like many of the books at the time, the heroine is an orphan. At the age of 21, she leaves her aunt and uncle to make her fortune in the world -- and, she hopes, her happiness, since marrying a farmer she doesn't love &quot;just to get a living&quot; doesn't seem either honest or wise to her. <br />  <br /> The book covers almost twenty years in New England -- about ten years before the Civil War through about five years afterwards. The heroine is energetic, intelligent, determined, and capable. And she WORKS! She is always looking for a way to be useful, to pull her own weight, and to help others. The book chronicles her path through a series of jobs and the emotional, physical, and spiritual ups and downs that come with them. <br />  <br /> What is most amazing is that the heroine meets a fugitive slave on her first job and treats her as an equal. Unlike &quot;some of the other girls,&quot; she doesn't refuse the job simply because the cook is black. <br />  <br /> The touching ending scene, in which a diverse group of women pledge to make a better world for themselves (and perhaps to get the right to vote), includes many of the friends she has encountered along the way, &quot;black and white, rich and poor.&quot; <br />  <br /> However, this beautiful example -- and for the time, this very daring example of inter-racial cooperation -- is marred somewhat by an unaccountable bigotry against the Irish. The anti-Irish comments are all the more jarring because they are completely gratuitous; they have no bearing on plot or character development.  <br />  <br /> The best that can be said about this failing is that perhaps the author was unconscious of her bigotry, and that at least the Irish are not mentioned often, although every mention is uniformly disparaging.  <br />	2004-07-30

This one (the fourth in the series) was my favorite; I read it until the pages were so dog-eared that it was almost impossible to slide them back into the box, and then I read it some more until I had it nearly memorized, and then I read it some more until it fell apart.<br />I still have the books; I ran across them when we moved recently and realized that I need to look for hardcover editions.  They are all in bad shape, despite attempts at mending them over the years.<br />The books are still funny, and they still develop the important critical and analytical thinking skills needed to imagine a different time, place, and way of life.  <br />I think that the books are well suited to the 9-to-12 age range that is usually recommended.  Each chapter is typically a separate story, which makes the series ideal for the reader who struggles with longer works.  They're officially \\"boys' books,\\" but the publisher's notion of the primary market segment didn't stop me or my sisters from enjoying them. <br />(A slightly technical aside:  what makes a publisher think of a book as a \\"boy's book\\" or a \\"girl's book\\" is not just the gender of the main characters (which are all boys here).  It's also the style:  boys usually buy action-oriented books, and girls usually buy books which invest more time in thought, dialogue, and emotion.<br />(To give one example of this phenomenon, Bridge to Terabithia, whose main character is a boy, is definitely a girl's book.<br />(While the Great Brain stories are almost always action-driven, there is a fair bit of thought analysis in these books, so I think they're a little closer to the midpoint of the gender spectrum than the typical \\"boy's book.\\"  <br />(For example, something will happen, JD (the narrator and the Great Brain's younger brother) will then analyze the situation:  if I do this, my friends will think this, Papa will think this, and Mama will think this.  If I do this other thing, then everyone except Mama will react this way.  So I will do this other thing, and be prepared to give Mama this excuse for what I'm doing.)<br />I want to add for the sake of those who might have to listen to complaints (e.g., those on school library committees) that various bias and sensitivity organizations which review children's literature have occasionally rated books in this series as racist, sexist, materialist, individualist, and conformist.<br />That is, the various stories (many of which are at least semi-autobiographical) in the series depict things like:<br />*  the horrible treatment of a new Greek immigrant boy at the hands of the town bully (as well as the silent compliance of most of the boys -- isn't that just like real life?), and the town people's shocking indifference to the welfare of an elderly Jewish man (thus the racist label:  people behaved badly at times in the books -- just like they do in real life -- except that here, they're all sorry for it in the end); <br />*  fairly run-of-the-mill girls-have-cooties themes and some historically accurate gender roles (and some historically accurate breaking of gender roles:  for example, Mama is a crack shot with a rifle) (thus the sexist label);<br />*  The Great Brain himself is tormented by his Money-Loving Heart and constantly scheming to get more money (thus the materialist label);<br />*  The Great Brain has a me-first attitude (which is partly balanced by actions like whipping the bully for mistreating the immigrant boy) (thus this individualist label); and <br />*  the boys in the story have an informal code of honor (you don't pick on kids younger than yourself, for example) that they all conform to, and social censure is applied by the whole group (none of the other boys will play with you any more if you break the code of honor) (thus the conformist label).<br />I was thinking of their code of honor the other day when I took a couple of neighborhood girls to the park and witnessed a (completely unsupervised) boy of about eight or ten annoying a couple of preschoolers.  It sure made me wish for a time when boys thought that annoying little kids was dishonorable.)<br />Over all, I think these are excellent books which every child should have the opportunity to read -- and I'm searching now for a complete set of the books in hardback editions.	2004-06-17

It's a strange mix of historical accuracy and complete nonsense:  in 1290, paper and ink were precious commodities and no girl would have thought of wasting them on her current favorite expletives.  A diary from that time would instead be filled with important news (which this includes), sage sayings, copied poems, and other scholarly-sounding items.  Paper and ink is not where the young lady of 1290 would have naturally poured out her private soul, much less thrown screaming fits and recorded her many insolences and disobediences.  (Actually, she probably wouldn't have had access to actual paper at all, as none was produced in England until the late 15th century; parchment was typical instead.)  However, if you pretend that this isn't really 1290, it's screamingly funny.  Catherine is really a modern young woman set in a sort-of-1290 setting, and most of the book is about her growing awareness of her sexuality and her father's bald-faced efforts to sell her to the highest bidder, I mean, to marry her to an appropriate husband.  Given what sends some parents to the telephone, I am amazed sometimes that I've never heard a complaint about her chronicling the size of her growing breasts, but it really is handled in a completely innocent and lighthearted fashion, so I don't see much to complain about (except the ending:  not only is her feminist resolution well before her time, but the lightning-speed shifts in position are a little disconcerting).  This is a book about a girl, and therefore, in my experience, about half of the boys in upper elementary/lower junior high will be unhappy about reading it.

This is a fun book, not too long for your average 'chapter book reader,' that takes you to a different time and place.  <br />I'm not sure what the time or place is -- the landscape is medieval Britain, as advertised, but the characters are most definitely not -- but the psycho-cultural inaccuracies are usually easy to overlook, and you get a funny, colorful, interesting book filled with details of what para-medical support was available at the time for pregnant women.<br />Cushman is at her best with intelligent, feisty, growing young women, and this book is true to that vein.	2003-10-31

I have since decided that it's best read aloud; there are pleasant subtlties of the rhythm and consonance that I missed in my first quick (and silent) reading.  Also, if you're reading aloud, you can read it to younger children than I would attempt as an independently read chapter book.  Reading aloud solves some of the language challenges.<br /><br />When I think about this book, I remember the timelessness of the \\"learning about yourself\\" and \\"doing your best\\" themes.  I remember the high proportion of adults who are helpful and kind -- even the military invaders in this book are kind to children -- and the great number of usually forgotten people who served the public and their country through the social safety net provided by the medieval church.  I think about the author's beautiful illustrations and descriptions of people and places in this medieval, 1300s setting.<br /><br />What struck me as odd a few minutes ago is that I don't ever think about  the fact that the central character of this book is physically disabled, and how accepted this is by all of the characters in the book.  This is particularly unusual because the book was written more than half a century ago about a time that is more than half a millenium ago, so it well predates the modern sense of \\"political correctness\\" or social support for people with disabilities.<br /><br />The disability drives the plot and the protagonist's character development in some respects, but it's really not dwelt on -- the disability is a fact, and what remains is not to point out how special he is or what noble character he was endowed with, but to see how a pretty average child adapts to life as it is, instead of life as he expected.<br /><br />Since so many modern books that cross my desk are filled with petty junior-high boy-girl interactions, or write off *all* of the adults as uncaring or useless (or worse), I have particularly enjoyed reading this uplifting book.<br /><br />All of the characters believe in working persistently towards your goals and doing your best.  Furthermore, in an age of preternaturally precocious protagonists who do daring things but learn very little, Robin has clear character flaws -- he even throws temper tantrums early in the book -- and you can see him growing up as the chapters go by.  Problems are solved, skills are developed, and the solution to the castle's invasion difficulty and Robin's future is resolved in the end.<br /><br />I know that a study guide is available for this book, but I don't know if \\"The Door in the Wall\\" is widely used in schools.  It's length (a little to the short side) is a good recommendation, and it's positive, inclusion-oriented attitude towards people with disabilities also speaks well of it.  Despite the number of pages spent on military actions, it's really a non-violent book, which will appeal to many parents.  (But fewer boys:  it's not gross enough, and everyone will think it's a little slow.)<br /><br />However, despite these points in its favor, I think that most public school teachers will want to think carefully before using this as REQUIRED reading for ALL students, because it portrays the institutional Christian religion in a uniformly positive manner -- and every public school seems to have at least one loud parent who will be offended by anything that isn't snidely disparaging of religion.

Books	5	283	316	N	N	A helpful book for friends and family members	(I have just read through this again, and I apologize for it being so long.  If you don't want to read the whole thing, the summary is this:  this book helps family and friends, particularly those who are new to mental issues, figure out what they can actually do to help in what appear to be hopeless situations, and it helps you a little bit to quit blaming yourself.)<br />I read this book about the time that a close friend of mine fell completely to pieces -- again. <br />He's creative, brilliant (a true &quot;high genius&quot;), has studied biology, is unusually knowledgeable about mental illness -- and is violently offended by any suggestion that he might have the same disease that institutionalized his mother for years and which appears to affect about a third of his close relatives (to varying degrees).<br />There is apparently a book called the DSM that lists the exact requirements for psychological diagnoses.  My friend can recite, word for word, all of the sections of this book that apply to his family's class of diseases. <br />But he can't see that these items have anything to do with his own life.<br />For example, he may tell you that he has all of the major signs of clinical depression, and that his mother was bipolar, and that there is a category of bipolar disease whose sole diagnostic requirements are (a) that the patient is clinically depressed and (b) that the patient has a close relative who is bipolar, and that FOR ANYONE ELSE, this definition means that they have a sub-class of bipolar disease, BUT NOT HIM.<br />Like many people with his disease, he has done hallucenogenic drugs because he thought that being freaked out on LSD (or dead) might be better than being depressed.  He has also become addicted to caffeine, tobacco, and any number of other legal or semi-legal substances.<br />Like some people with his disease, he claims to have spoken with and fought with demons and other spirits, and he believes that certain specific geological featuresare as alive as any animal, but &quot;in my case, this is just part of my spirituality, although in most people it would be a sign of mental illness.&quot;<br />While he has finished college and held a couple of jobs, he has never once left a job on good terms with the employer, or, in fact, any individual on the staff -- they've all &quot;suddenly changed, and turned against me.&quot;  (Several of them &quot;have tried to kill me.&quot;)<br />He has been engaged to be married several times, but they've all &quot;suddenly changed, and turned against me.&quot;  He can point out the exact hour that each one &quot;suddenly changed, and turned against me.&quot;  That this moment corresponds to the sudden onset of clinical depression &quot;is irrelevant.&quot;<br />With a few exceptions, he is on poor terms with his family -- while they probably used to love him, he says, at some point, they've all &quot;suddenly changed, and turned against me.&quot;  (According to my friend, only one of them has tried to kill him.)<br />He suffers from sudden, terrible depressions, which he never thinks of as an imbalance in his brain, but as a natural result of the whole world &quot;suddenly changing, and turning against me.&quot;  (You'd be depressed, too, if the whole world turned against you.)<br />(He did once agree to &quot;conduct an experiment&quot; with a relatively mild antidepressant, and reported that it worked:  it cleared up his depression. But then he quit taking it because he didn't need it:  he never had any mental problems to begin with.)<br />When he's on an &quot;up&quot; swing, he thinks that everyone is for him (and every woman in love with him), and on a &quot;down&quot; swing, they've all &quot;suddenly changed, and turned against me.&quot;<br />He honestly believes that he is the only steady, stable person in the world.  He honestly believes that everyone else &quot;suddenly changes, and turns against me.&quot;  <br />And it was in this context, with the policeofficer telling me that I really ought to file for a restraining order because of his latest telephoned threats, that I heard about this book on the radio.<br />What I learned from this book is this:  my friend is probably not ever going to really believe that he has a significant brain chemistry problem.  And since it's not going to happen, I don't really need to invest my energy in that issue.<br />I learned that his internal feeling of what happens is NOT that he cycles into angry depression or mania, which is what it looks like to the rest of the world; his internal feeling is that he stayed the same, and everyone else suddenly changed.  <br />(And what good could it do for YOU take drugs, go to therapy, or do anything else, if the real problem is that the entire rest of the world has &quot;suddenly changed, and turned against me&quot;?)<br />I learned that battles need to be selected with care:  so many people fight to get the patient to &quot;believe&quot; that he has a disease, and this is much less important than trying to get them to take medication (if anything is appropriate and seems to work for them), to show up for therapy, and to take care of themselves.  <br />I realized that I was trying to get him to say the words &quot;I have a disease,&quot; when what is necessary is &quot;You need to eat every day.  You need to sleep every day.  You need to take a shower.  You need to save that money so you can pay your rent.  You need to talk to your therapist.&quot;<br />This is hard, especially now that I, too, am on the long list of people who have &quot;suddenly changed and turned against me,&quot; but I am glad to have a task before me that has some hope for success, and to know that his continued belief that he's the only sane person in the world is not any fault of mine.	2003-10-21

I've read some of the original editions (which unfortunately reflect the sexism and overt racism of their pre-WWII origins), all but one or two of the re-writes from the 1960s and 1970s (which are better in those categories), and significant proportion of the 'new' versions.    I enjoy seeing the social attitudes, clothing, and slang change between editions.    I'm not impressed with the newer editions.  They pander to a rather cynical and juvenile fantasy of effortless omnipotence.  The main characters are never portrayed as developing their skills; instead, they sprang omniscient and invincible from the forehead of the writing committee.  Furthermore, the old sense of responsibility -- for example, that you pay your own way and keep in contact with your family -- has disappeared from this book, just like it's disappeared from Hollywood's notion of pre-teen society.    A major theme of these books (which, BTW, are marketed to pre-teen girls, not boys) is that You Must Have a Boyfriend to be Complete.  There are regular scenes in which Joe, who is now intuition incarnate, defends his latest beautiful crush against suspicious evidence (he falls for a new one at least once each book), where Frank and Nancy admit being somewhat attracted to each other...     This particular book has the additional bad grace of introducing not one, but TWO bit players who are throwing constant, life-consuming temper tantrums because Mom and Dad Don't Like My Boyfriend.  I can't imagine why the world needs more examples of self-centered brats.     I recommend steering clear of this book.	2003-08-30

I haven't yet found a Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery that I like.  I had the misfortune of reading this one recently.  <br />The first time I attempted this book, I actually screamed and put the story down on the second page, when George -- level-headed, athletic, practical George -- falls head-over-heels in love the instant she lays eyes on a new man.<br />Nancy ticks her off for asking him (a reasonable, relevant, Miss-Manners-would-approve) question, and George defensively spits back, \\"I was just, you know, interested!\\"  <br />Nancy, of course, resorts to the deep inward sigh.  She could tell by George's tone of voice that she was in love... <br />It was just so unbelievably *dreadful*.  Can you believe such garbage?  Can you believe the defensiveness, the eye-rolling intolerance, the destructiveness of this interaction, the cynical \\"I'm too polite to tell you that you shouldn't fall for a cute guy, but I'm not grown up enough to realize that it's none of my business\\" -- and we're only on page 2?<br />Well, thinking back to junior high, I remember that this was about how it went:  She might like him, so her best friend felt rejected, so obviously they have to be jerks about it, and so on.  Even the eye-rolling and \\"just, you know, like, I mean!\\" were all part of the ritual.  <br />But you kind of hope that people grow out of it.  That kind of thing is why junior high is so awful. <br />The good news is that George's interest in said young man turns out to be irrelevant to the rest of the book; in fact, there's remarkably little of this series' hallmark, which is that investigations must be handled with a strange sort of tact to avoid suggesting that someone's crush might be a suspect.  <br />The rest of the book isn't as bad.  The Hardy Boys' plot is beyond belief (do you really think the government would hire a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old to track down missing nuclear material?  And then not even give them basic equipment, like a Geiger counter?).<br />The denouement is a little weak; for example, sudden changes in political and professional positions are announced for no readily apparent reason.  (Well, I don't count \\"we're in L-U-V\\" to be a readily apparent reason.)<br />But overall it certainly improves once you get past the beginning.	2003-08-30

The level of deliberate rudeness, sarcasm, and self-centered defensiveness makes you want to scream.  The characters no longer have that level of self-control and security that made them resemble young adults -- there are sections that are more like listening to a bunch of particularly ill-mannered junior high kids squabbling. <br />A major theme of these books (which are clearly marketed to pre-teen girls) is that You Must Have a Boyfriend to be Complete.  Did we really need to know that Joe thinks his latest girl smells like wild mint when he kisses her?  Do we really need to listen to Frank and Joe fight about whether this girl tried to kill someone, with Frank pointing out that she had the opportunity, and Joe pointing out that she's too dreamy to do something like that?<br />I recommend steering clear of this book.	2003-08-30

To enjoy a work of fiction, you have to be able to suspend your disbelief.  That is, the author has to give you a setting that you think could be plausible in this or some other world.<br />But, really, people, do you think that Nancy Drew, age 18, can pass herself off in FBI spy school as having not only completed college, but also having a master's degree in French?<br />And Frank and Joe, posing as college graduates and computer whizzes, are once again working for the mysterious Network, who apparently doesn't have any high school graduates who are capable of doing anything.<br />The guilty characters are... well, let's just say that was beyond belief as well.  Not surprising, exactly, but still beyond belief.<br />While it's definitely action-packed (which boys will like, whereas I believe they'll hate most of the books in this series), and the FBI school setting is interesting, I think this might have been the worst book qua book in the Supermystery series.	2003-08-30

Jealousy and possessiveness are always ugly.)<br />I could almost recommend this book, if only it had been written with an assumption that the readers could actually read well... but, then, committees (Carolyn Keene is the trade name for a committee, not a real person) have never been the best source for good writing, so you don't expect better than what they've produced.	2003-08-30

This book covers an interesting area of alternative medical therapy.  There's a lot of good in this area, and there's much less potential for harm than in many such areas.    But there's also some very bad science in this book.  For example -- and I choose this one because you can look it up in the sample pages -- the author wants to you believe that there is proportionally three times as much Oxygen in dirt than in the air.      The author further claims that approximately two-thirds of your body is Oxygen.  (In fact, there are more than twice as many Hydrogen atoms in your body than Oxygen -- I did mention that I'm a biologist, didn't I?)    What irritates me most is the author's sweeping claim that ALL cancer cells are \\"anaerobic.\\"  ALL of them, no matter what kind of cancer.  And not merely microaerophilic (can get by on limited oxygen):  this author believes that cancer cells never use any oxygen at all.  NOBODY can make human cells of any kind live or grow without oxygen -- not even authors who convinced a friend to suggest his name to the Nobel prize committee.    Furthermore, the author completely neglects the difference between an obligate anaerobe (\\"dies in the presence of oxygen\\") and facultative aerobes (\\"can use oxygen, or not, depending on its availability\\").  That a cell need not use oxygen as its primary respiratory source does not mean that the cell will necessarily die in the presence of oxygen.  Normal muscle cells are a good example of this phenomenon; marathon runners are sore the next day because of the byproducts of anaerobic metabolism in muscle cells.  But the muscles don't die when sufficient oxygen is restored to them.  But this is his position on cancer:  just get a reasonable amount of oxygen into your body, and those cancer cells will all fall over dead.  (If only it were that easy.)    And so on, throughout much of the book.      But the fact that his theory is weak doesn't mean that every practical recommendation is wrong.  There are a few things that I wouldn't touch if you paid me, and quite a lot that is significant overreach, but others might be helpful and more are at least harmless.  My point is merely that the theoretical basis is really quite inaccurate.    So if you will promise not to believe the theoretical underpinnings, then you might get some useful information out of this book.  In short, you should use your COMMON SENSE with this book -- just like you would for anything else related to your health.       P.S.  Ozone, by the way, is NOT \\"energized oxygen\\"; it's three Oxygen molecules unstably and briefly linked together (O3 for short).  Your cells CAN NOT directly use O3 for metabolic purposes.  You MUST have O2 (normal oxygen gas) for that purpose.      But don't worry:  O3 readily degrades into normal/useful O2, plus a single Oxygen free radical (but not usually enough of it to do you any real harm before it reacts with something else into a stable state).	2003-05-12

It works -- what else can I say?)  My sisters learned to read with this series.  I've used it with other beginning readers.   IT WORKS.  <br />The simple line art drawings are easy to understand.  The simplicity keeps your attention focused on the words.  The type is a good size for little kids, and the font exactly matches how you print the letters.  <br />After you fill in the blanks, you get to color the pictures, which has the effect of making you review the page again. <br />(I recommend that you have a set of eight basic crayons for use with the book so that the child can compare the word &quot;green&quot; on the page to the word &quot;green&quot; on the crayon label -- especially for boys, as they have a higher risk of being partly color-blind.)<br />The usual recommendation is that the child should only do one page or a couple of pages a day, as this is more effective for retaining and applying the principles behind reading.  <br />Placement tip:  If the child easily and rapidly completes the first five pages, turn to the middle or the last few pages in the book, and if they can read them, then it's time to move them up to the next book.<br />It's important to remember that this is designed for LITTLE KIDS -- people for whom the research has demonstrated that printing letters neatly is a significant, multi-step cognitive task.  <br />Adults will find it simplistic and boring.  It's not printed in vivid colors.  It doesn't have flashing lights.  It doesn't make sounds, and you can't click on anything.  <br />But if your goal is READING instead of entertainment, then IT WORKS.<br />There is a &quot;consonant book&quot; that can precede this one if the student has very little knowledge of letters and the sounds they make.  It's often better to offer something just a little too easy at first instead of something frustrating.  If it turns out that it's really too easy, then the child has earned the rightto be moved up to the next book without being forced to complete the first one (unless they just want to).	2003-05-08

We had just finished The Prayer of Jabez (about which I have some strong reservations).  I was glad to see that Secrets of the Vine is not as easily misunderstood.  It is a short book and an easy read, but  I thought that it was oversimplified and that you had to dig to find a significant point.<br />What I remember best from the study was not God's methods for dealing with people, but the attitudes of the women in the group about themselves.  With very few exceptions, the women consistently expressed how little they value themselves and the work that they do.<br />The book asks you to think about whether you produce &quot;no fruit,&quot; &quot;little fruit,&quot; and so on; nearly everyone said that they produced  no fruit or little fruit.  <br />I was a little surprised:  our group had a broad cross-section of women at all stages in life and every social and economic group.  Many of them are the kindest, most gentle women you have ever met; in addition, they teach Sunday school, tithe, spend time daily in prayer, feed the hungry, visit the sick, can quote lengthy sections of the Scriptures, lead various community service and mission projects, and so on.<br />Despite having an amazing collection of women in the group, I'm not sure that even one woman out of our 30 or 40 really thought that she produced &quot;much fruit&quot; (although we could all name half a dozen &quot;humble souls&quot; who should have laid claim to it).  <br />But even the &quot;pillars of the church&quot; demonstrated an unshakeable faith in their utter inability to reach whatever nebulous ideal of &quot;a Christian producing much fruit&quot; they had in mind.  Unfortunately, there wasn't much in the book that I thought would address their low self-esteem.	2003-02-23

It has its merits, and almost all of the other women who read it were very enthusiastic about it.<br />For myself, I happened to develop a very poor opinion of it, partly because of the out-of-context and inappropriate interpretations that these enthusiastic women produced from it, which ranged from...<br />...the mother who said that God would give her a huge house if she prayed these words for 30 days...<br />...to the group leader who said that the Bible says that Jabez built furniture for a living (his occupation is unknown)...<br />...to the school teacher who said she learned in Chapter 3 of the book that the Bible directly quotes Jabez as saying &quot;Surely I was born for more than this!&quot; (it doesn't).<br />The author does go to some trouble to explain that the blessings that one should seek are the blessings of effective service -- not more money, a nicer house, or anything materialistic (although one can easily see how a stable job or a reliable car, etc., could be instrumental to increasing the opportunity for effective service).<br />However, it's a short book, and that brief point (they're ALL brief points) appears to have been lost on many readers.<br />If you are a serious reader -- a voracious, thoughtful, engaged, educated reader looking for a well-reasoned, well-written, well-supported, carefully balanced treatise on prayer -- then you will probably be unhappy with the blithe and superficial treatment that Mr. Wilkerson has given to his lifetime of prayer in this book.<br />On the other hand, serious readers with genius-level language skills and a solid background in the topic are not the market for this book.<br />The target audience is &quot;normal,&quot; busy, television-oriented people with short &quot;soundbite&quot; attention spans, average language skills, and a deep conviction that God wants to punish them instead of help them.  Even non-readers read this book.<br />If you're looking for something short, light, and emotionally inspiring, then this book will fit probably the bill.<br />The reading level and style is about on par with Chicken Soup for the Soul, and its brevity will appeal to most: I read the whole book in less than an hour.<br />There's nothing particularly new or particularly challenging in it, but most of the concepts in it are the sorts of things that we could stand to be reminded of.

You, the teacher, are supposed to be in charge of what happens in your classroom.  Living up to your job description will not hurt your students or turn them into uncritical automata. <br />The real purpose of classroom management is to make it possible for you to TEACH in the first place.  The fact is that, no matter how brilliantly you present today's objectives, if the classroom is too loud and chaotic for students to pay attention, then you might as well have just stayed in bed. <br />I really believe that the first step in direct instruction is to provide a classroom where students are able to be in their places, to look at you, and to pay attention -- or at least not prevent everyone else from doing so.<br />One idea I developed from Canter's book:  attitudes are the family's problem.  Even if the family is failing at their job, I'm STILL not the parent, and -- while I want my students to be happy and well-adjusted, and I certainly facilitate that noble goal -- my REAL JOB is to get them to do their work, not to throw a fit if they don't happen to hand in their papers with gracious smiles.  Similarly, I actually do NEED my students to be quiet when I'm explaining the next assignment, but I don't NEED them to &quot;wipe that scowl off your face while I'm talking.&quot;<br />Canter's book helps you understand the effectiveness of clearly drawn &quot;lines in the sand&quot; and absolutely certain, wholly impartial, escalating consequences which are given to any student crossing those lines.<br />I have used Assertive Discipline techniques to help parents.  In one memorable instance, a young mother was very inconsistently screaming and paddling her toddler for &quot;thinking(!) about getting into the refrigerator.&quot;<br />Using Canter's framework, we worked out the difference between perceived intention and actual action, and the importance of a clearly understood, black-or-white rule.<br />This mother resolved to enforce &quot;Do not OPEN the refrigerator&quot; as her rule, and developed a escalating list of reactions, so that she had clear alternatives to her screaming fits and paddle-swinging.<br />Consequences were applied with 100% certainty and 100% impartiality.  Screaming was forbidden.  The mother decided to make paddling an absolute last resort.<br />Two weeks later, the problem was completely gone, and the mother felt more confident, more capable, and more effective than ever before.  Best yet, her child didn't need to be afraid of accidentally provoking a screaming fit any longer:  everyone knew where the line in the sand was.<br />The same system can work in your classroom, and Lee Canter shows how to create a functional classroom without throwing a temper tantrum in front of the class.<br />It can be done.  YOU can do it.<br />For some teachers, Canter's approach will be a significant departure from their &quot;style,&quot; but if you (or your neighboring teacher) screamed at the class this week, then it's probably time for a departure from that &quot;style,&quot; even if someone has been perfecting that temper for decades.<br />Let me strongly recommend that you do NOT read the first edition of this book; there are clarifications of his ideas and methods in subsequent editions that will help you avoid some common mistakes.  In particular, the common misunderstanding that the author wants you to &quot;publicly shame your students into better behavior&quot; is specifically and categorically rejected as both cruel and ineffective.	2003-02-22

To borrow an old quotation, this book presents many new and good ideas.  But the new ideas are not good, and the good ideas are not new.<br />I admit that I'm an anachronism here:  I still believe that schools are, or at least should be, scholastic enterprises instead of delivery points for social skills, medical treament, and psychological care.  <br />I further believe that a school is, or should be, run by adults (who have presumably learned something worth passing on) for the benefit of students and ultimately society as a whole, at least to the best of our abilities, and that this generally ought to be done along practical lines, instead of ideological ones.  <br />So much for my own biases.  Let me digress briefly:  Have you ever asked psychologists how they deal with everyone else's problems all day long?<br />They say that they're supposed to be mature enough and emotionally stable enough to handle it.  <br />I believe that there is an analogy here to the teacher-student relationship:<br />I believe that the teacher should be mature enough to provide support and empathy to the class WITHOUT asking the class to be a significant source of emotional support for the teacher in return.<br />So you can imagine my horror at seeing the following sentence on page 2 as a description of the authors' collective dream:  &quot;It invites young people to see an adult as a person who needs just as much nurturing and encouragement as they do.&quot;<br />The authors actually recommend that teachers deliberately train students to be co-dependent in this manner!  <br />I confess that I have not managed to force myself to finish reading this book.  I have read as much as I could, and I have rated it higher than my experience with it justifies on the chance that perhaps the rest of the book is better than the parts which have impinged upon my consciousness.<br />What I have read, however, is either (a) covered in every other book on the same topic or (b) weak, sappy, platitudinal, or self-contradictory.<br />However, in the hope that it will be useful to you, and based upon what I have read and/or skimmed, I believe that what the authors want from the world is this:  <br />(1)  Teachers should not &quot;act controlling&quot; or mean.  You need to be in control (otherwise you won't be able to teach), but don't let it warp your personality.  In other words, be nice.<br />(1.1)  Whenever possible, teachers should let the students be in charge of setting up classroom rules, deciding punishments for their peers, and even teaching students who fall behind. <br />(2)  Teachers should encourage a sense of community and teamwork in the classroom.  They recommend class meetings at length, although that is only one mechanism that could be used to achieve this goal.<br />In my opinion, this goal doesn't make much sense unless your students spend half or more of their time in the same group [whether or not all of that time is with you is not relevant]:  no one can truly &quot;feel a part of&quot; each of seven different class-communities, plus a lunch-break-community and possibly a sports-team-community and a service-club-community.<br />(3)  Teachers should always be emotionally connected to their students as unique, valuable, cherished individuals.  <br />Within reasonable limits, I hope that we all do this.  But unlike the authors, I believe that there is a time and place for the teacher as the impartial imparter of knowledge and trainer of skills.<br />I don't know how the teacher who faces 150 new students each semester will manage both the authors' ideals AND their curriculum content, but the authors are strong on the point about feeling loving.  One does tend to get the idea that actual content isn't as important to the authors, so long as their social agenda is forwarded.<br />I'm afraid that I can't recommend this book.  In particular, I recommend that NEW teachers avoid it.  <br />If you like the ideals, then there may be some value to readingthe book, so that you can evaluate your classroom arrangements from a different perspective -- but NOT until after you have a good handle on day-to-day management and have learned about your own strengths and weaknesses (which usually takes a few years).<br />P.S.  Does it surprise you to see (according to the list on the back cover) that none of the authors are teachers?  They're family counselors, and their approach is much better suited to a family counseling setting than to a classroom.	2003-02-22

Kaye was her light, little fairy tale, The Ordinary Princess.<br />Weighing in at nearly a thousand pages, there is not much &quot;light&quot; or &quot;little&quot; about The Far Pavilions.  It is a gripping story (once it gets going) about the South Asian subcontinent during British colonial rule.  <br />This is one of the few books in which I have sincerely appreciated and wholly enjoyed the author's efforts to provide an extensive description of the scenery (of which there is a lot to describe, since the plot takes you through a large section of the subcontinent in the course of a few decades).<br />The character development rates an A+.  Partly because of the length of the book, we have the opportunity to get to know more than just one character, which is nice.<br />Like some other reviewers, there are a few moments in the book that I don't care for -- the desert love scene is always high on my list of odd moments, for example, and towards the end, I think that the author unfairly blames religion for South Asia's social and political divisions -- but overall these moments are few and far between, and I recommend the book.	2003-02-22
US	41869111	R3ASKU2JE8OQHO	0064401847	127537711	Bridge to Terabithia	Books	2	73	97	N	N	A great book for adults/young adults -- not kids	I read this book shortly after it was published, in my \\"ample free time\\" as a teacher.  The rest of the staff all raved about it.  I didn't care for it.  <br />It's reasonably well written, the storyline is easy to follow, the two central characters are reasonably well developed, and it is very good at pulling you around by your emotions.  <br />But instead of being a reasonably accurate portrayal of a 10- to 12-year-old's coming-of-age, it always strikes me as being some adult's fantasy about how a child might respond emotionally to tragedy (or pathos), if only he or she happened to have an adult's experience and perspective.  <br />It does not surprise me to learn that the books was inspired by a terrible loss in the author's personal life:  the book's measured and ultimately didactic feel makes one assume that it was written to exorcise personal grief and to share Truths which were purchased at great personal cost.<br />I personally didn't care for the book, and it didn't ring true for me (or apparently for many students), but it does seem to appeal to adults, particularly the caring, child-centered, empathetic, motherly sort of person that typifies the majority of suburban elementary school teachers.<br />In some schools, \\"Bridge\\" is a standard book for about the fourth or fifth grade.  The level of understanding that these students usually have is:  \\"They didn't like each other because she could run faster, then they were friends, then she died, and it was sad.\\"  <br />Ten-year-olds, however, do not really understand what they author is saying about making friends, the value of imagination, the nature of human relationships, the effect of emotions, the presence of death, the enormity of grief -- even the futility of saying anything after a funeral, and the importance of saying it anyway.  <br />In other words, they aren't able to understand why this book is Real Literature, and not Just Another Book for practicing reading skills.<br />If your goal is to introduce a discussion of affective issues, I'd suggest that you save this book for junior high or even lower high school students, instead of giving it to the upper-elementary school students upon whom this book is usually inflicted:  Just because the average fourth grader can decode the words on the pages does NOT mean that they have enough experience (maturity) to understand what the author wants to tell them. <br />(I'd make an exception for a grief-related student support group:  if a fourth-grader has actually lost a friend or family member, then he or she would be in a better position to understand the purpose of the book.  <br />But most 9- to 12-year-olds [and those who teach them] are encouraged to steer clear of this book.)	2002-12-04

It has its merits, and almost all of the other women who read it were very enthusiastic about it.  <br />For myself, I happened to develop a very poor opinion of it, partly because of the out-of-context and inappropriate interpretations that these enthusiastic women produced from it, which ranged from...<br />...the mother who said that God would give her a huge house if she prayed these words for 30 days... <br />...to the group leader who said that the Bible says that Jabez built furniture for a living...<br />...to the school teacher who said she learned in Chapter 3 of the book that the Bible directly quotes Jabez as saying &quot;Surely I was born for more than this!&quot; <br />The author does go to a little trouble to explain that the blessings that one should seek are the blessings of effective service -- not more money, a nicer house, or anything materialistic (although one can easily see how a stable job or a reliable car, etc., could be instrumental to increasing the opportunity for effective service).<br />However, it's a short book, and that brief point (they're ALL brief points) appears to have been lost on many readers.<br />If you are a serious reader -- a voracious, thoughtful, engaged, educated reader looking for a well-reasoned, well-written, well-supported, carefully balanced treatise on prayer -- then you will probably be unhappy with the blithe and superficial treatment that Mr. Wilkerson has given to his lifetime of prayer in this book.<br />On the other hand, serious readers with genius-level language skills and a solid background in the topic are not the market for this book.<br />The target audience is &quot;normal,&quot; busy, television-oriented people with short &quot;soundbite&quot; attention spans, average language skills, and a deep conviction that God wants to punish them instead of help them.<br />If you're looking for something short, light, and emotionally inspiring, then this book will fit probably the bill.<br />The reading level and style is about on par with Chicken Soup for the Soul, and its brevity will appeal to most:  I read the whole book in less than an hour.<br />There's nothing particularly new or particularly challenging in it, but most of the concepts in it are the sorts of things that we could stand to be reminded of.  If you already understand something about the theology of prayer and the non-materialistic nature of God's goals for people, then you are unlikely to mis-understand the book and lead yourself into serious error (e.g., the prosperity doctrine).<br />And you may leave the book feeling empowered to ask God for more opportunities to serve -- and you will be more aware of these opportunities when they appear.	2002-05-06

It's the fourth grade boy whose mom...&quot;  or &quot;That's the certified teacher whose M.A. in education and 18 years' classroom experience doesn't stop her from telling her own girls...&quot; or even &quot;That explains why I hated the 'fun' Gifted and Talented program in sixth grade!&quot;<br />I found Dr. Rimm's approach straightforward and practical; no suggestion in the book is controversial or tending to the dramatic.  <br />The book is organized by personality type and age so you can customize the approach to your own situation.  She has clear suggestions for enrolling staff assistance and dealing with divorced/blended family issues.  <br />Her writing is credibly reinforced by research and her own clinical practice.  <br />I was particularly impressed with her sections on &quot;Yes-No parenting&quot; and ADD/ADHD kids.  If your child is a &quot;late-developing&quot; or &quot;borderline&quot; ADD student (or if you just want to keep him or her off Ritalin), then you need to read this book for the simplest, clearest explanataion of what you can do right now.<br />However, my professional experience has taught me that a few parents (and teachers) are emotionally attached to their own, occasionally extreme &quot;philosophy&quot; about children, so let me add a few words for them:<br />In my own office, I have seen well-educated, loving parents choose their &quot;philosophy&quot; over time-tested, research-supported, developmentally appropriate methods of dealing with children.  Usually, these people are parenting out of their own emotional wounds.  In my experience, their children are much more likely to develop severe emotional and attention problems.<br />This is for these parents:  The basic reality of life is that YOUR actions affect the outcome.  If YOU want a DIFFERENT outcome, then YOU need to try DIFFERENT actions.  <br />If your children are underacheiving, defiant, needy, controlling, or attention-dependent, you MAY have to make a choice between keeping your philosophy and having confident, productive children.  <br />This may be a hard decision to make, especially if your philosophy is driven by still-raw wounds from your own childhood or recent traumas.  And there are substantial consequences for your decision.<br />If you're committed to your philosophy, or if you are parenting out of your emotional wounds, then you probably won't LIKE this book until you resolve your own emotional trauma.  <br />But when you're ready to try something that works, get this book -- it can help you develop a stable, happy, confident, effective child.	2001-11-19
