In the hands of, say, Nevada Barr, the same story would have leapt off the pages.  However, we have a book chock full of the inexplicable and the unexplained, cliches, improbabilities, two-dimensional stereotypes, characters acting out of character, ... in fact, to be brief, thoroughly poor and unskilled authorship.	2003-01-22

Jeri is an engaging, courageous and honest protagonist and, along with secondary characters, is well-drawn by the author.  The plotting here is compelling and frighteningly topical.  Jeri and her exploits rank highly on my must-read list.	2001-03-26

However, I came away from this book with a feeling of disappointment.  The author has retained her page-turning skills but I found I wasn't as satisfied having reached the end of this book as I have with others in the series.  The climax appeared not to have had much of a relationship to what went on before and none of the characters, or their circumstances, aroused any sympathy.  Also, Kinsey is becoming quite a pain with the over-emphasis on her wise-cracking humour and her end-justifies-the-means attitude to life.  Kinsey has become what seems to be a self-parodying, two-dimensional caricature of herself.  I would look forward to a return to the Kinsey of old.	2001-03-23

(On the other hand, shouldn't each book in a series be able to stand on its own?) This intallment obviously draws on characters and situations more thoroughly developed in earlier stories.  So I really didn't feel I knew enough about the characters, just from this book alone, to empathise with their predicament and understand their motivations.  Also, the shamanic/Pan theme was quite over-emphasised and distracting and not too well juxtaposed with the other techno theme.  However, the Willa Jansson character has intrigued me sufficiently to want to explore at least one more of the books in this series.	2001-02-25

This is the first book in the Joe and Dulcie series that I have read.  However, the cat sleuth theme is not handled as convincingly here as in stories written by, for example, Lilian Jackson Braun and Rita Mae Brown.  While I can suspend disbelief and accept that cats may communicate non-verbally with their owners, or with each other, I was not able to suspend my disbelief and accept that two cats can speak and read English.  Nevertheless this is an engaging, rainy-day read.	2001-01-29

However, I am not sure what the point was in the long and involved examination of the Fool movement in this installment of the Kate Martinelli series.  It was not particularly interesting and, as a sub-theme, actually took over the story rather than assist the reader in any way to deal with the main plot.   Also, there is unnecessary repetition in the description and exchanges in the Kate/Lee relationship.  We seem to be told several times, and in a variety of different ways, that Lee is disabled and Kate blames herself for it.  Nevertheless, this book was worth three stars as the talent of the author to spin an engaging story is well evident.	2001-01-29

The main characters are warm and likeable and the Southern settings attractive and evocative. The plot in this book takes somewhat second place to the characterisations and environment but still makes its strong point.<br />My recommendation is that no Judge Deborah Knott story should ever be passed over unread.	2001-01-20

He seems now to be perpetually depressed and his motivation to pursue this investigation was quite obscure.  The author didn't really persuade me that there was a compelling enough reason for Renko to want to get to the bottom of the death of his friend.  Added to that was a plot that was unnecessarily confusing and obtuse.	2001-01-14

However, while the usual good plotting is in evidence here, the turgid interpersonal relationships between Kay and Marino and Kay and Lucy are becoming tiresome.  Also, Kay is becoming a little self-indulgent and egotistical.  A little more plot and less of the interpersonal stuff would be good.	2001-01-08

She is superb at plotting these gothic, yet not too gory, thrillers.<br />Just a couple of problems, though, that led to this book being only just satisfying.  First, after weaving an intricate plot over several hundred pages, the revelation of the bad guy is quite rushed and an anti-climax - it was all over in just paragraphs and I'm not completely persuaded of this person's motivations.  Secondly, the author's characterisations are going off beam somewhat.  The verbal exchanges of the characters, and Scarpetta's own narration, are at times superficial, predictable and quite sophomoric (to use a word that crops up regularly in this series).  As a result I would have been happier to give this book three and a half stars, if that were available.  <br />Much as I find Scarpetta an iconic figure in the genre, this really relies on earlier installments in the series.  The stories would need to tighten up in the areas mentioned above before I'd again rank the series with the best in the genre.	2001-01-05

Kate is an interesting character but, to be honest, offers nothing new to the genre, neither does the author's treatment of the lesbian cop theme - this has been done before, and repeatedly.  <br />Plot-wise, this story was novel and compelling, although the emphasis on various religious aspects to the story was wearying.<br />The revelation of the killers in Night Work was rather rushed and unsatisfying.  After having set the climax up over several hundred pages, the discovery of who the killers are was glossed over superficially and too quickly.  Their motivations for committing the crimes were not completely credible. <br />However, this book is full of promise for a person who, like me, is new to the series.  I certainly will look for others written by this author.	2001-01-02

This is a good example of compelling plotting and good characterisations.  The author combines the sweet sadness of China's home life with the brutal terror of the murder plot.  This is in the vein of Kinsey Millhone stories but China is a somewhat more domesticated Kinsey.  Well worth a try.	2000-11-29

She has succeeded again with this installment in the Callaghan Garrity series.  The storyline revolves around the inhabitants of the down and out area of Atlanta near where Callaghan and her mother live.  The author depicts the struggle and horror of the lives of these people in a poignant sub-plot.  The major plot involves a twenty year old murder and its modern-day consequences.  This is something that of course has been done before but this author carries it off with her usual high skill and humour.	2000-11-12
US	51755888	RPDM1E75XPRCH	042516988X	862635689	Stray Kat Waltz (Kat Colorado Mysteries)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Another good read from a reliable author	The shocking tragedy suffered by Kat at the beginning of the story seems to propel her and influence her attitude through the remainder of the book.  She is a little more cynical and reckless than usual, although why she would take this particular client's case so much to heart is mystifying.  Neither the husband or the wife or any of the other characters involved in the spousal abuse theme of the book are at all appealling.  Alma and Lindy, and of course Hank, are not present in this story, and Charity has somewhat of a back seat.  As a result, there is a bleakness and an edginess to this book.  However, the plotting is as compelling as we are used to from this author.<br />One final note: it was disappointing to have Hank die so soon after Kat finally agrees to marry him.  So many female PIs in this genre have rocky love lives - as if you can't be tough and independent and be in a stable relationship at the same time.  WRONG! Even some of the lesbian PIs are in the same boat.  It would be refreshing to see a hard-boiled female PI maintain a stable relationship with a significant other - like the other 99.99% of us more or less manage to do.  Oh, and if I find another woman PI who has a closer and more stable relationship with her dog/cat/mother/etc than the significant other in her life - well, I'll just scream!	2000-11-08

Kat is largely away from home in this  book so her interactions with her family, best friend and boyfriend are not as frequent in this book as in most others.  For me, it is the interactions among these characters that are a major strength of the books in this series - along with the usually terrific plotting.  But, the plotting was a bit lacklustre in this outing and not as compelling as other books in the series.  Nevertheless, this is still a good read from reliable story teller.	2000-10-29
US	51755888	R2IBQHBD0EY9UV	0446606197	22542378	Killer Market (Deborah Knott Mysteries)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Highly recommended	This author is remarkably easy to read and her Deborah Knott series always extremely entertaining.  Usually Deborah's adventures are set in her home town among her large family.  This homespun feel adds a lot to the attractiveness of the series.  This was necessarily missing in this installment as Deborah travels to another town to help out a fellow judge for a week.  Also, the author chose to centre the plot around an international furniture market being held in the same town that week.  While the change of settings added novelty, the furniture market setting was a bit distracting and confusing.  Nevertheless, as with all books by this author, it is very highly recommended.	2000-10-21

It is not demanding or particularly compelling and the characters are somewhat two-dimensional and caricaturish.  The plotting is simplistic and homespun.

I would not put this book among the author's very best - the plotting definitely is interesting but the climax and revelation of the killer do not live up to the promise of the plotting.  Nevertheless, the author has created a likeable main character in Mike Deacon, although it is quite inexplicable why he would choose some of the friends he does.	2000-10-11

The main detective characters take second place to the lives of the victim, killer and their associates.

It tells the story of Anna, a woman now in her fifties whose mother was murdered when Anna was 8 years old.<br />Anna has been trying to suppress all her memories of the night that her mother was killed and the subsequent hanging of the man convicted of her mother's murder, her mother's adulterous lover.  Suppressing these memories becomes impossible when the murder becomes the subject of two separate investigations 45 years later and Anna is forced to remember things she would rather not about those times.<br />The plotting is interesting here and the major characters developed at some depth.  The conclusion does not come as a huge surprise but the book is nevertheless well worth the effort to get hold of and read.	2000-10-02

The territory is not dissimilar to that occupied by her other major character, VI Warshawski - both geographically and socially.  However, here characters were two dimensional and completely unappealing - there was no-one I really cared enough about to make the journey to the end of the book really worthwhile.  Also, while we know that a lot of men behave horribly toward women, there is quite some heavy-handedness with this issue in this book whereas this author has handled this same topic more subtley and effectively in the VI books.<br />Nevertheless, this author is greatly talented and this showed through in this book.  And thanks, too, for the little salute to VI fans before and during the text.	2000-09-28

Fran is a young, feisty homeless person who seems to thrive on being alone and a loner.

For something different to the usual can-do, superwomen of female-detective crime fiction, give this a try.	2000-09-24

However,  in this final outing in the Morse series, the plotting is not as  interesting nor as compelling as past efforts and quite clearly takes  second place to the further, and final, development of the characters, in  particular Lewis and Strange.  This author has been setting the stage for  the bowing out of Morse for some time so the precise manner in which Morse  departs the genre is not unexpected, shocking or surprising. <br />But Morse  will be sadly missed and I join in the comments of an earlier reviewer that  a prequel would be very much looked forward to!	2000-09-13

This one was  another where Qwill leaves behind Pickax and his usual cast of supporting  characters.  On this occasion he wants to avoid another freezing Pickax  winter. This gives the author the opportunity to show how unhappy Qwill now  becomes outside his Moose County environment and away from Polly Duncan.<br />The most interesting books of this series are the ones set outside  Pickax as this gives Qwill and the cats the chance to relate to new  characters and situations.<br />This is a book in the cosy genre; the  plotting is not its strength and I don't think ever was meant to be.

The plotting is tight and  extremely suspenseful.  The portrayal of Renko, the main protagonist, as a  man with a tortured soul, is finely drawn and most convincing.  I cannot  recommend this book highly enough.	2000-08-20

The plotting was  compelling, clever and tense and the main protagonists well drawn.  The bad  guys are clearly delineated if somewhat two dimensional.

I found the main characters warm and engaging and this alone will ensure that I locate and  read the rest of this series.<br />The plotting however was loose and  confusing and the motivation of the &quot;bad guys&quot; equally unclear.

Her  characterisations are sound and believable.  The plotting is interesting  and compelling.  The main protagonist is a woman in her sixties which is a  wonderful change from the youthful PIs and amateur sleuths that exist in  the majority of the mystery genre.<br />I am pleased to have found a new  series of mysteries to read.

But after that the pace picked up and the plotting became more  coherent.  This is a PI tale in the Sandra Scoppettone mould.  The main  protagonist, the lesbian PI Eliza Pirex, is very vividly drawn as are most  of the secondary characters.  This book shows considerable promise and it  is a loss to the genre that it apparently did not develop into a series.	2000-08-15
US	51755888	R3KI9M4XYA031E	0515128821	842485314	The Breaker	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Engrossing	This author's skills as a writer of suspense and good plotting continues  to improve.  The author's characters are well drawn, although only among  the secondary cast list are any of them anywhere near likeable.<br />The plot  is compelling and not exploitative, despite its basis on a sexual assault  and the sad and tawdry sex lives of the main protagonists.  One relatively  minor flaw is that the identification of the killer and the circumstances  of the crime tumble out in a matter of a couple of pages or so.  This  leaves some questions unanswered and is a rather unsatisfactory way of  concluding a story that has developed over the preceding three hundred  pages.<br />Nevertheless, a good read.	2000-08-05

While the series had a slow start in Asking for Trouble,  that book showed some promise as to how Fran would develop and the author  lives up to this promise in Keeping Bad Company.  Fran's character is  developed and she remains the core and focus of the story.  There is an  intelligent plot, albeit somewhat predictable.  It would be interesting to  see Fran develop a harder edge in the future while retaining her youthful  honesty.	2000-08-03

Nevertheless, it is a refreshing addition to the genre. The main protagonist, Fran, is a very  young homeless girl who is as naive as she is unpretentious.  She is the  best characterisation of all the characters in this book - the remainder  being somewhat two dimensional.  Don't  give up on this book though as Fran  is a delightful character and one well worth following through the other  parts of this series.	2000-07-30

For this  reason, it is a difficult book to read yet I found it oddly compelling.   <br />Be prepared to find none of the characters in this book at all  appealling, including the main protagonist.	2000-07-25

The protagonist is an uncompromising police officer in a world where compromise is survival.  While the plotting in  this book is not compelling, and Jill's dedication to getting to the bottom  of the problem is not readily understandable, I would nevertheless  recommend this.  It has certainly made me want to hunt out and read the  rest of the Jill Smith series, and other books written by the same author.	2000-07-15

Annie McGrogan is a (seemingly reluctant) private investigator who continues to sit auditions in the hope that she will get her break in her acting career - her  &quot;real&quot; job.  <br />This novel is nearly half way through before the  murder of the title occurs and the author spends a lot of time discussing  the acting philosophies of her fictional alter ego.  While this is  interesting in its own right, it tends to get in the way of the plotting  and doesn't seem to have left time for more rounded characterisations.   Some of the characters are very nicely drawn but others are a  bit two  dimensional.<br />There is some nice humour here and also some apt social  observations.  The potential and talent of this author are obvious.<br />I  think the author might have to decide whether Annie is a PI or an actress -  it doesn't seem that she can do both well.<br />Nevertheless, for a light read  on a rainy day you could do worse.	2000-06-07

Then the story goes back in time to two days before the  shootings and traces the seemingly innocuous events (including fraud,  forgery, love requited and unrequited) leading up to the shootings.<br />As  usual, this author can stun and delight, and in this book there are  well-drawn characterisations of village denizens.

It shouldn't be taken as an authoritative medical tome on pregnancy, but it certainly does not pretend to be one either.  Iovine  tells the warts and all story of conception and pregnancy.  It reads and  entertains very much like what it says it is  - a bunch of women friends  getting together for a gripe session on their pregnancies but with plenty  of the joy and fun of pregnancy there too.  <br />Being humourous does not  mean this book is short on providing information.  If anything, the funny  realism of the text aids in recall of Iovine's advice and account of her  and her friends' experiences of their pregnancies.<br />Highly recommended.  A  great mother's day gift for a pregnant chum.	2000-05-14

This was my first read of a Barbara Block novel and I was sufficiently intrigued to want to read more of this author's work.  As with a lot of first reads, it can be a bit difficult to warm to an already  well-established character but I found Robin Light generally believable, in  the usual can-do mould of female private detective protagonists.  I found  the endangered animal theme fresh and compelling and the Syracuse settings,  and descriptions of the young secondary characters, gritty and painfully  realistic.	2000-04-20

Lilian Jackson Braun has the talent of bringing a wholly and undoubtedly fictional scenario (I mean there can be no place on earth like Pickax!) to life with warmth, yet some sharpness.  The characters and their doings,  throughout this series, are more important than the crime and its final  solution by Qwill and/or the cats.  A lovely, heart-warming read always.	2000-03-13

Her descriptions of Ellis and Liberty Islands, and the people that populated and cared for them, were done with liveliness and affection.  It will be interesting to see how the  Molly/Anna/Frederick triangle will develop.  A thoroughly exiting  &quot;chase&quot; scene at the end was one of the best written of the  genre.	2000-02-18

I read the  first 100 pages at bedtime when usually just 10 or so of another book would send me to sleep.  Has some flaws - but nothing's perfect! This writer has the gift of good  characterisations and natural, fluid dialogue.  Callaghan Garrity is a bit  of a superwoman, but then aren't so many of the male PIs (supermen, I  mean).  I love the house-cleaning business setting and Callaghan's  employees and sometime fellow-sleuths.  I look forward to reading the rest  of the series.	2000-02-05

Superb plotting as one would expect from this author.  This book continues the Morse mystique (he is still able to attract women half his age) but gives Lewis a little more assertiveness.   Quite unputdownable.	1999-11-10
