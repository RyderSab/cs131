Taking pictures is NOT a crime, and as long as you're on public property, you can photograph just about anything. Knowlege is ammunition and all photographers should know their rights. <br /> <br />This is well written and illustrated with photographs by the author. It is written for the layman and contains a glossary of legal terms. <br /> <br />And Krages is a good guy. Just because one has a legal right to photograph something, he writes, doesn't mean we should, for ethical reasons. <br /> <br />Put those security goons and pushy police on notice - You know your rights!	2005-05-21

It's an exciting story of a great person who moves from one adventure to the next, eventually putting her life in great danger. <br /> <br />And it happened. After this book was published, Betancourt ran for president of Colombia. She was kidnapped by gorillas and at this writing, is still being held hostage somewhere in the mountains of her beautiful country. <br /> <br />Here's wishing Betancourt the best.

There is no better or more complete history of the cities and towns that make up the Great Lakes region, making Summer Studies a surprising and valuable textbook. <br />Dwelle is a good storyteller, writing about the people he meets and the places he visits with obvious affection. And the setbacks that befall all sailors one time or another are here,  often told with great humor.<br />However, Summer Studies suffers from several colosssal flaws. There is no discernible system of organization. It is as if the book was composed on a series of index cards which were then shuffled and made into a book.<br />Dwelle also never misses the opportunity to insult those who own powerboats. According to Dwelle, they are all ignorant buffoons who have no right to share his precious lakes, but in the book he never takes the time to give the reason for his bigotry.<br />Dwelle also unwisely allows his leftwing political views to get into the way. He says one town, for example, fell into hard times because of &quot;Reganomics,&quot; but he is unwilling to elaborate or substantiate his claim.<br />I struggled over whether to give Summer Studies three or four stars. On content alone, it is superb. But the book screams out for a better editor, who could have shaped it into a five-star winner.<br />I hope Dwelle is working on a sequel. And I hope he has learned from the mistakes of &quot;Summer Studies.&quot;	2002-11-15

The description on the back of Jeffrey's book claims he has found it.<br />Not so. Jeffrey repeatedly relates the bible to scientific knowledge, yet he never supports the bible with science. (Don't feel bad, though, Jeffrey, because you are attempting the impossible.)<br />Too often he says things are just too complex or wonderful to occur without God's involvement (evolution is one example). Yet that's all the evidence he offers. Is this, as the blurb claims, his \\"convincing evidence that the scriptures can be trusted\\"? <br />Furthermore, if all of nature's wonders must be created by a greater force, why must it be God? Why not Allah? Or Zeus? Or Santa Claus?<br />This book is weak. I was hoping it would challenge my thinking, instead all I found was rubbish. I was once a Christian. But as I began to use my intellect, and truly studied Christianity and cultures, I realized it was all folklore. There is no evidence that the Bible's teaching are true, and there is no evidence that Jesus ever existed. Keep looking, Jeffrey.<br />If Jeffrey's goal was to support Atheism, he has succeeded.	2002-06-28
