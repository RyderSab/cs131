It sounds terrible, like something out of a twee Disney film, but in actual fact Stapledon manages to avoid anything like that, and has written an incredible, touching story. It reminds me of &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; and &quot;White Fang&quot;, and doesn't avoid the dark side of Sirius' nature... there are a couple of particularly savage passages where Sirius kills a sadistic farmer, and also &quot;murders&quot; a horse just to indulge his canine instincts.<br />Sirius ends up seeing the full range of human life, from bad to good, and more. He is also not a true dog, and finds himself not only alienated from human beings who cannot accept him fully (with a handful of exceptions), but other dogs who are like cretins to him especially his &quot;lovers&quot; (as the book puts it). Despite having difficulty speaking and writing (he devises ways to get around that), Sirius has an advantage over other dogs through his intelligence, and over humans in his hearing, sense of smell etc. What we get is not only a satire on English life during WWII, but an almost autistic view of the world, seeing everything but not able to integrate oneself into it.<br />Of course some of the writing is dated, and Stapledon at times takes a very colonial view of the Welsh and their language (Sirius is originally brought up on a Welsh farm by English academics). Some of the style is very dry and typical of the period (for example when Sirius spots a holy roller farmboy pleasuring himself, Stapledon calls it &quot;something unspeakable&quot;. Fortunately Victorian hangovers like these are not common).	2003-06-19

Murdo is a great comical idea, but a wasted one. For example, we encounter the Free Church detective Sam Spaid, but then we find that Smith squanders him on two obscure and unfunny chapters. Great chance, but maybe he was afraid of annoying the church. Then Murdo has his \\"Highland prophecies\\"... again, could have been good, but none of them are funny apart from \\"There will be great grief in the Glen when the Visa card is lost\\" (or whatever it was). I can't help thinking that this wouldn't have got past as a first time novel...<br />In short - Murdo's a string of good ideas that could have gone somewhere, but didn't. I laughed twice during the whole book!<br />Recommended instead - Consider the Lilies (a serious novel, but unlike this, at least a classic).	2003-06-19

This is the story of how he got past Kenya's apartheid (a South African term but applicable here) and pass laws into an American university. Its descriptions of Kikuyu tribal life are interesting, English/British imperialism, the colour bar in Kenya, and also an African's reaction to India just after independence.

I don't know how accurate the historical side of it is, but it is still interesting for those who don't know a great deal about the Cathars, and this is an insight into the intolerance that mainstream Christianity has demonstrated towards other, often harmless faiths.<br />There is one passage that upset me greatly, where a husband and wife know that they are going to be burnt at the stake, and they try and work out how they will deal with it. It wasn't the best written piece I've read, but it brings some humanity to what was a barbaric situation.	2003-06-19

Most people will I think come to this book via the author's classic &quot;Angels of the Universe&quot;... however, I think this book is much more inferior. <br />&quot;Epilogue of the Raindrops&quot;, is really what is promised in its title - pretentiousness, sub-joycean self-indulgence (it reminded me a little of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, although this book is actually intelligible) etc. <br />The characters don't stick in the mind, apart from the churchman writing pop tunes (where have I seen that before? The Finnish film &quot;The Man without a Past&quot; has a similar line involving the Salvation Army!). You will also find no true dialogue in this book, which some people may find heavy going. It's more in the style of a giant prose poem, and divided up into movements, sections, parts etc to no avail.<br />Read if you're a completist wanting to get your hands on all the Icelandic literature you can, but otherwise, don't bother.<br />Recommended instead - Angels of the Universe (10/10), and Brushstrokes of Blue (Modern Icelandic poets, including some of Einar Mar Gudmundsson's work).	2003-06-19

John Fowles indulges his sexual and literary fantasies, entering them from every angle he can manage until he expends himself. What results is not \\"one man's interaction with his muse\\" as one review called it, but unreadable and pretentious and not remotely sexy subporn... that wouldn't have been publicised - or noticed - if they hadn't come from someone as well known as Fowles.<br />Some of the parts, such as his encounter with a black nurse, and a guitar wielding dominatrix muse read like something out of a bored private schoolboy's diary.<br />It's a pity, because John Fowles was once a great writer... but this book and \\"Daniel Martin\\" do him a great disservice.<br />Mercifully short, and that's it's one bonus.	2003-06-19

Reading \\"Roadside Picnic\\" is a nice antidote to both. SF is meant to be Science and Fiction, not Pulp and Trash.<br />As a novel it isn't perfect. I reckon it only really gets going about 3/4 of the way through, but having said that, the first 3/4 ARE readable. Like Lem's \\"Solaris\\" it tackles questions about ETs that corporate SF doesn't deal with, like \\"Can we communicate with aliens?\\" & \\"Can we even understand them?\\". The aliens in Roadside Picnic aren't two dimensional Klingons or Vulcans, but genuinely alien.<br />Some of the dialogue could do with tidying up too (translator's fault?), but unlike the majority of junk that masquerades as classic Science Fiction in English, it stands up as literature and a good novel in its own right. Theodore Sturgeon's excellent foreword points this out better than I can.<br />One more thing... you might be surprised to find out that Russian characters are actually thin on the ground in this novel. They seem to be in the minority - apart from Kirill. There are no obvious \\"Soviet vibes\\" from it either, political or otherwise.	2003-06-19

It's grim, it's eerie, and it's a tale of survival. The idea is basic, getting food and hiding evidence of their existence is a daily hazard etc, but in many senses it doesn't just prophesy WWII, but also the '60s peace &amp; &quot;back to the land&quot; movements.	2003-06-19

There are a number of reasons for this, but I think most important is that unlike &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; or &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, she wrote a succinct piece, and didn't allow herself to ramble. Anyone wanting an introduction to Rand should start here, it won't take you long to get through, the writing is pretty good, and it lacks the convoluted plots and characters of her longer pieces. In a strange way it is at times quite moving, and also lacks some of the more objectionable statements that can be found in Rand's other pieces, bordering on racism &amp; fascism at times... this is a classic struggle for Individualism against a smothering regime, but not a struggle putting down other people's individualism.<br />I suggest that any person coming to &quot;Anthem&quot; should read &quot;WE&quot; by Yevgeny Zamyatin first. It was written in 1920, only a few years after the Russian Revolution. Russian was Ayn Rand's native language and she would have been able to read this book in the original, in fact she left Russia six years after &quot;We&quot; was published. &quot;Anthem&quot; was written seventeen years after &quot;We&quot;. Various features of &quot;Anthem&quot; seem to have been taken from &quot;We&quot; (Brave New World and 1984 were also influenced by it, but not to the same extent). The most obvious similarity is that the characters have numbers, not names, and don't think of themselves as &quot;I&quot; but &quot;We&quot; and there's also the diary format in common. A major difference is that in &quot;Anthem&quot;, the society has regressed technologically. Although this particular Hive/Ultra-Communist set up has been much copied since in fiction, it was not so common when Zamyatin was writing.<br />I believe that Rand was heavily influenced by &quot;We&quot;, and of course had a shared Russian background with Zamyatin... even if you don't agree with me, &quot;We&quot; is well worth a read in its own right for fans of &quot;Anthem&quot;.<br />Trivia - &quot;2112&quot; by Rush is said to have been inspired by &quot;Anthem&quot;, although the two stories only have basic similarities!	2003-03-30

There's just so much here, some of it you'll rarely if ever need, so it can be daunting if you're just starting out. It's not a book for learning the verbs in my view, but a book for seeing you've got the verbs you know right (and cheating on Hausaufgabe)... if you want to learn German verbs try a workbook. You want to be a little bit ahead with your German before you start with this!!!<br />I see this in the same way I see my bigger German dictionary... it's useful at home for reference, but you're not going to carry it about with you!

This dictionary appeared out of the blue, and didn't seem to be known to any of my Scots acquaintances. It may have been rushed... anyway it is better than \\"Abair\\" which may have been a pocket dictionary, but which contained few words I ever needed (unlike Buchanan's it does have an excellent verb & grammar section).<br />Some of the words are given in a form that's not... e.g. \\"broadcasting\\" is given as \\"craobh-sgaoileadh\\", whereas you'll find the contracted form \\"craoladh\\" getting used much more often. \\"Craobh-sgaoileadh\\" is rarely used. But at least it gives \\"broadcasting\\" and other modern terms, which is more than can be said for many Gaidhlig dictionaries which have never been updated.<br />Also the dictionary is inconsistent in the extreme. For example, if you look up something as basic the months of the year, you'll find it gives some and not others. Why? There's a few others, but I can't recall them just now.<br />This dictionary is cheap, which is its biggest advantage. It's usable. It's not perfect but at this price it's not worth complaining.	2003-03-02

I regret however Boas didn't tackle Australian Aboriginal or Maori art in detail since both of these genres have become popular in recent times.

While it does sail close to the pretentious at points, it avoids going over that edge, and raises some serious social points.<br />There's some great social commentary in this book... about Dagny the rebellious bourgeois girlfriend of the &quot;hero&quot;, NATO, the way we can treat the mentally ill much like criminals, society-as-a-whole's own insanity... and as one reviewer has already quoted that key line &quot;The madhouse is in a lot of places&quot;*. Our society is completely hypocritical about madness. <br />This book doesn't feel like a translation to read.<br />The film is excellent too, but since it isn't in English, will be overlooked sadly. :(<br />* I wonder in fact if Arthur Koestler's (non-fiction) &quot;The Ghost in the Machine&quot; has influenced this book.

In addition, Sagan only really deals with fundamentalists... he ignores that there are Christians who believe in evolution for example - this makes his thought too dualistic and not impartial, and he doesn't tackle the abuse of science, for example in the arms race. Or in fact latent fundamentalism amongst scientists in the past, such as the furore amongst certain physicists when quantum theory emerged.<br />Writing style -<BR>The self-righteous tone of the book is ironically reminscent of a preacher who has \\"seen the light\\". This will irk both hardened sceptic, and potential \\"unconverts\\", who won't be attracted away from their demons. He's a terrible writer! But at least this isn't his fiction. It is just about readable, and will provide a few easy laughs if nothing else.<br />Practice and Tolerance -<BR>Sagan didn't exactly apply his ideas in real life. For example, he frequently used emotional & mystical arguments to bolster his pet \\"SETI\\" program, as well as holding illogical preconceptions of how aliens would be or communicate. Also, and this is something often forgotten, Sagan penned a Von Daniken-esque piece or two about the possibility of ancient Close Contacts! Everyone, whether they admit it to themselves or not, is prey to illogical beliefs.<br />Some of the ideas he seeks to debunk in this book are indeed bizarre and silly but they're harmless; in a democracy, people have that choice and we have to tolerate it. Intolerance is not positive, as he should have realised when talking about witch burnings.<br />I recommend Michael Shermer's \\"Why people believe weird things\\" instead.  <br />Also for anyone who's interested in the case for and against scientific practices, have a look at these books -<br />\\"Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science\\" by Paul R. Gross, Norman Levitt (Contributor)<br />\\"Thomas Kuhn and the Science Wars\\"<BR>by Ziauddin Sardar<br />\\"The Golem : What Everyone Should Know About Science\\"<BR>by Harry Collins, Trevor Pinch <br />You'll get a better view of science and pseudo-science through these than Demon Haunted World.	2002-11-21

Books	4	24	25	N	N	Both sides of Oriental Mysticism	In recent decades, the wholesale rejection of many Western ideals by large chunks of society has meant that people have turned to other sources... in many cases this has meant that they see those other sources as a little too perfect through their ignorance of them and/or they actually forget the better points of Western culture, because they see it to be totally \\"bankrupt\\". <br />While there are better guides to the overall \\"texture\\" and ideas of Asian philosophy and religion, Koestler doesn't flinch here from telling us some of the uglier details that don't generally reach the west. Yes, Koestler is at times a little prejudiced coming from a Western religious tradition (His family were Ashkenazi Jews), and you can see that in this book... but his descriptions of REAL Indian yoga, will show you how much it has been cleaned up and bowdlerised for western consumption. Koestler also reveals some of the darker side of Buddhism, particularly Japanese Zen, which as he shows can produce a doublethink which can avoid morality, and such thinking may have been partly responsible for darker moments of WWII in the East. He also comes up with many ideas that I haven't seen elsewhere... for example he considers meditation as almost a practice for death. He also reminds people of the similarity of lesser known Western movements to Oriental ones, and of the massive influence of the west on the east of the time (far greater by now of course). Koestler himself was not uninfluenced by certain Eastern thought, indeed he titled one of his other books \\"The YOGI and the Commissar\\", and often referred to the \\"oceanic feeling\\" in his works, a close lift from Buddhism.<br />Koestler was no Hippie (he had seen enough of *real* war and totalitarianism not to fall in that trap)... but in some ways he anticipated some of their concerns by investigating eastern thought, doing laboratory tests with LSD and being involved in the anti-nuclear movement.<br />This book is interesting, because it gives both sides of the story... not many books give a balanced view of the topic.	2002-11-21

As if I had to say it three times, but this is exactly what this book does... Mormons ARE Christians but the fact that they are doesn't necessarily vindicate their faith (or Christianity). This book plays word games repeatedly on the very people it is trying to help avoid them, except of course these word games come from the right side... The minds of most of the readers are already decided and closed.<br />We're told the Book of Mormon is the &quot;most correct book&quot; in the LDS Articles of Faith. If this is the case, why are there so many changes since the original edition? If it was correct then this wouldn't be the case.<br />2 Nephi 30:6 (1830) &quot;they shall be a WHITE and delightsome people.&quot; Now the word &quot;PURE&quot; is used.  Mosiah 21:28 (1830) &quot;...on learning from the mouth of Ammon that king BENJAMIN had a gift from God...&quot; Benjamin is now Mosiah. These are not minor changes.<br />This seed did &quot;swelleth&quot; nearly to double the size.<br />Alma 32:30: (1830): &quot;But behold, as the seed swelleth and sprouteth and beginneth to grow, and then ye must needs say, That seed is good; for behold, it swelleth and sprouteth and beginneth to grow.&quot;<br />Today: &quot;But behold, as the seed swelleth and sprouteth and beginneth to grow, and then ye must needs say, That seed is good; for behold, it swelleth and sprouteth and beginneth to grow. And now behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say that I know that this is a good seed; for behold, it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.&quot;<br />If you can't see these changes you need your eyesight tested. Those who wish to do so can buy a facsimile of the ORIGINAL 1830 Book of Mormon at Amazon.<br />What about Brigham Young? Let's read his own words (no word play here)... Here's his view of his being a prophet, judge for yourself (reference included for personal research into his writings)<br />Journal of Discourses, 5:177<br />&quot;I do not profess to be a Prophet. I never called myself so; but I actually believe I am, because people are all the time telling me that I am.&quot;<br />Brigham Young said about black people in his own Journal of Discourses, 7:291, again LOOK IT UP YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME-<br />\\"You see some classes of the human family that are black, uncouth, uncomely, disagreeable and low in their habits, wild, and seemingly deprived of nearly all the blessings of the intelligence that is generally bestowed upon mankind. The first man that committed the odious crime of killing one of his brethren will be cursed the longest of any one of the children of Adam. Cain slew his brother. Cain might have been killed, and that would have put a termination to that line of human beings. This was not to be, and the Lord put a mark upon him, which is the flat nose and black skin. Trace mankind down to after the flood, and then another curse is pronounced upon the same race-that they should be the `servant of servants;' and they will be, until that curse is removed; and the Abolitionists cannot help it, nor in the least alter that decree. How long is that race to endure the dreadful curse that is upon them? That curse will remain upon them, and they never can hold the Priesthood or share in it until all the other descendants of Adam have received the promises and enjoyed the blessings of the Priesthood and the keys thereof. Until the last ones of the residue of Adam's children are brought up to that favorable position, the children of Cain cannot receive the first ordinances of the Priesthood.\\"<br />The anti-black priesthood restriction was only lifted in 1978, and can be read in Doctrines and Covenants.<br />If you wish to KNOW the Mormon church, these quotes from Brigham Young and from the Book of Mormon are ENTIRELY relevant.	2001-12-09

I think he could have done so much more, but this is perhaps his best work... Still this book is an interesting curiosity. I'd say it's more for the layman than the hardcore scientist, and some of the book takes more of the form of travel writing, and unfortunately tries to generate excitement where it needn't be... The style isn't great, but the subject matter is, and one's glad Davies did write this book... I haven't come across many others like it.<BR>It concerns mainly one village, where some of the population were claimed to be 140, even 160 years old (in the 1970s). Davies claims these ages are verifiable by the baptismal records... As for that I leave you to decide for yourself... while not as accurate as census records, they do provide some backing. Davies also laments the passing of the old ways, and mentions that he considers that this may reduce the lifespans of their descendants... through pollution, a change in diet etc. Interestingly Davies mentions three factors that seem to repeat themselves in such places - high altitude, clean air and strangely enough the presence of the mineral Selenium in the soil...	2001-11-02

This book fills a needed void then. This is also a useful book since many of the people mentioned are underrated or their influence misunderstood. Not only that but some of these people were to influence others who came later in their family - Erasmus Darwin, Wollstonecroft (on the Shelleys- her daughter's Frankenstein being a seminal SF work)... <br />Despite the protestations of the Little Englander from Hong Kong (Michael Wheatley) below, Britain and England are the same thing (3/4 of the time minimum). He should know, after all he reviewed a Cantonese Chinese dictionary as well and there is no separate word for &quot;Britain&quot; in that language, only England and Scotland. In fact the English have been referring to their country alone as &quot;Britain&quot; since at least the 1300s (William Langland) and the first reference to the &quot;British Empire&quot; is in the 1400s.	2001-10-02

It certainly isn't a universal key to the chastity belt! For example, they tell you that women like rich men. This is assuming of course that your intended date isn't an anti-capitalist protestor or member of the Communist party! Secondly it might mislead you into thinking all women are more promiscuous than they are. Some women will go for menage a trois, but there's some who won't sleep with you until they've been past the altar... So that's largely a culture thing for your more &quot;liberated&quot;, liberal, American city chick (who isn't an anti-Capitalist protestor! :) ) Unfortunately I don't live in America, so some of the cultural references aren't helpful either.<br />I personally prefer Nick Casanova's &quot;The Macchiavellian's Guide to Womanizing&quot;. His book is funny. Okay it might not have pictures of scantily clad ladies but it does have some good tips and is much more amusing. I think it's got a better general application.<br />Secondly note the race bias- all of the models seem to be white chicks. Maxim, FHM etc are bad for this... You do get good looking oriental women as well.<br />On the plus side, it gives you some tips on what to do which might seem more inventive and also it tells you how you can buy her presents without leaving your seat over the phone (which unfortunately were all American numbers!)... As for the sex tips, they seemed quite good, but if I wasn't getting more of it, I wouldn't buy this book!	2001-10-02

This review is mainly about one point, but one that has sadly escaped popular and political attention most of the time.<br />While this book does play a useful part in refuting some of the disgusting revisionist arguments circulating, I think this book plays down the holocaust of non-Jews. The Nazis did not JUST liquidate the Jews, but Gypsies, and Slavs (for racial reasons), \\"Aryan\\" objectors and dissidents and the physically and mentally disabled. To say it was just directed at the Jews is misleading, and as dangerous. Yet this is the tendency. To also use it as a justification of the worse acts towards the Palestinians is also dangerous. It is certain true that the Jews bore the brunt but not that they were the only ones.<br />Perhaps the most dangerous form of holocaust denial is that which states that only the Nazi extermination of Jews was holocaust and nothing else. (At Auschwitz for example Romany/Gypsy survivors and their families have been excluded from commemorating their own dead in annual ceremonies. Such stories are heartbreaking in themselves)<br />Thankfully this book does not advocate this, but this idea has attained more academic respectability than classic holocaust denial against Jews. Not only does this deny the other sufferings of Jews, but it also belittles and DENIES the fact that many other peoples such as Tibetans, Armenians, Amerindians etc have all suffered genocide. All of these events are wrong, no matter who they happened to.<br />So in remembering the horrors of the past, we must exclude no parts.	2001-09-15

This is the history that France would rather forget, despite claims that the account was part fictionalised it nonetheless reveals disturbing tendencies in pre-German invasion France that were to aid the Nazi occupation and also create the Vichy regime. Anti-Communist and anti-Jewish tendencies, he claims were spreading through France at the time, and leading some people there to believe that German occupation may have been a necessary evil to purge France of left wing and Jewish elements. Koestler also documents the xenophobia spreading through the country...<br />Koestler and others were put into camps by the French. Koestler himself was partly a refugee fleeing the Nazis who killed other parts of his family in Hungary and Austria. Being an ex-Communist, led him into suspicion both by the French authorities and the Communists themselves. Koestler was to experience other traumas after this, notably being imprisoned in Franco's Spain (documented in his book &quot;Spanish Testament&quot;). &quot;The Homeless Mind&quot; is the only modern biography of Koestler I'm aware of and should be available from this stockist... and talks of this fascinating and intelligent but sometimes stupid and brutal man.	2001-09-15

I was surprisingly disappointed with this novel, partly because so much is left in the air. The relationship between Archie and his father (a finely disguised mix of RLS' father and Lord Braxfield- whose portrait actually appears on the cover), is perhaps one of the most interesting features. Christina or Kirstie (the younger one) appears part way through and although she is obviously going to be a major character in the novel disappears (because the MS cuts off) at just the least appropriate time. I suggest with the notes that you read a chapter and then read the notes for the next one, otherwise it can be a wee bittie piecemeal reading the thing. Don't be put off by the Lowland Scots dialogue if you aren't Scottish, Miller has listed the more important words at the back and most appear several times. What is there is well written (although pretty wordy by today's standards), but it's not good to be left in the lurch like that.	2001-02-26

The Book of Deer is one of the most neglected Scottish historical resources...It is an important piece of evidence in the search for Lowland Gaelic... so too is it the earliest known Scottish Gaelic. It appears to have been written in response to the Norman plantations of the period, since although Gaelic had been written down in Ireland from an early stage most of the land contracts were oral, unlike the Anglo-Normans who wished to colonise the Scottish lowlands. Thus it is a good counterweight against much of the later historical revisionism in Scotland- most people in North East Scotland are unaware of the book or the fact Gaidhlig had been spoken in the Lowlands.<br />The text of this book alone is worth five stars, but I'm afraid the pictures are not very interesting, which is why I've taken a star off. By the way I believe PBE is co-author, not sole author of this work. This work has gone some of the way towards making this book better known.	2001-02-26

In some ways it can be read as a tragedy or a gothic novel. It can be hard going, with in depth chapters on various details on the lost art of whaling and whales themselves. Melville worked on whaling ships for many years and had first hand experience of what went on, so too he heard the stories. Although some people I know don't like this approach to novel writing, I think it fits very well into the whole.<br />Melville's novel is almost manichean in its nature. Ahab is a blasphemer, and a Cain like wanderer in quest of the monster that took his leg. It shouldn't be forgotten that Ahab was the king in the Bible who helped lead his people into idolatory against Elijah. Many of the epic motifs are here- the futile quest and dangerous obsession, man's struggle and sometimes hatred of the force's of nature, the danger of following the mad leader and so on. There is also a hint of almost black magic in parts. Most of the book is concerned with the ship and its crew and the sea and the White Whale, the two are pitted against each other. It is a book of the Elements. But whereas Ahab does not forgive the white whale, the sea &quot;forgives&quot; Ishmael, who survives to tell the tale symbolically by holding onto a coffin as the ship goes down. <br />I think its message about leadership is important. Ahab's obsession is what kills his men. Moby Dick is merely defending himself. But his men could have easily prevented their deaths had they taken the step of mutineering early on.<br />There's a lot I can't say here, because I'd just be repeating what other people would say better. Don't forget this isn't the only book Melville wrote- his short stories are amongst the best in early US fiction.	2001-02-09

Unfortunately Thomas Wolfe has been overshadowed by that other more modern writer sharing his name. It would be safe to say that that other writer was more revolutionary. Thomas Wolfe is not doing much new, he is a story teller, and one not to all tastes. Tom Wolfe you read for his place in literary history, Thomas Wolfe you read more for its description of the second quarter of the twentieth century and New York.<br />He rambles a lot. He repeats himself. Sometimes it's hard to tell where he's going with something, and sometimes it's very obvious we're dealing with roman a clef, or what Wolfe wished his life to have been. It's more a collection of incidents, until he meets his &quot;gal&quot;. I get the feeling Wolfe was striving after that elusive &quot;Great American Novel&quot;, and its whole look at life is very American. It concerns the boy from the small town south (thinly veiled North (? South) Carolina), symbolically coming together with the North (including his girlfriend who is an epitome of the North). But it's difficult to see much more depth than that, that's not to say it isn't there, but there isn't much sign of it.<br />If you keep on at it, it's not a bad read, but it's not the best read I've had either. His style makes for fairly slow reading and it drags a little a third of the way through.	2001-02-09

(it's the ending which has &quot;taken&quot; one star off my rating). Always the polymath, Koestler starts by covering psychology, including Skinner's experiments with rats and subsequent theories on human nature which he pulls apart thoroughly. Koestler then comes out with the unfashionable theory that the human brain may have evolutionary flaws in it, since it was merely built on the older more primitive brains of its ancestors and the new and old parts do not always communicate well with one another. Partially because of this we have a lot of the problems of human life such as the urge to self-destruction and violence, which emanate from the older parts of the brain. He ties this in with history and if I remember, results of some shocking experiments. It has lost some of its immediacy since the end of the Cold War (nuclear bombs are still with us more than ever in Israel, Pakistan, India, China etc).<br />While I have simplified some of the book's ideas above, it is not always light reading, but it can be read by a layman. I think some of the subjects Koestler tackles are taboo (such as the idea humans overall are instrinsically &quot;evil&quot;) rather than innately good, and he dismisses wishful thinking. Some people do take issue with his ideas... unfortunately some of the attacks are ad hominem... but where they aren't I suggest you examine very carefully both sides of the story. The message in this book is still pertinent enough, even if the proposed solution isn't.<br />(if you would like to read more on Koestler, read my review and others, about Cesarani's biography of him on this site)	2001-02-09

He explored such areas as LSD, eastern religion, voluntary euthanasia and nuclear disarmament years before most people... He was caught up in many of the ideological causes of the age- Communism and later anti-Communism, Zionism, the movements against capital punishment and nuclear weaponry (although curiously he espoused abortion), as well as rubbing shoulders with a number of well-known people from different countries. No way do I agree with everything he said, but he has been written off because he alienated certain people. His writings about science for example, contain many controversies, but at the same time they contain many home truths.<br />I would recommend Cesarani's biography, for the simple reason there is so little on Koestler now, and his books are mostly out of print. It is heavy going at times, and there is a slight self-righteous tone going through the book. Koestler did do and say some objectionable things (wife beating for example and bullying), but then again so have many &quot;great people&quot;. Winston Churchill for example said and did far worse things. Cesarani is right to point out Koestler's tendency to neglect his Jewish roots, but he overplays this theme since he repeats it through the book (partially because Cesarani is a Jewish historian). Most interesting in this book is Koestler's life which touched on many important events, many places and ideologies and which is an incredible life by any standards. <br />We need to re-examine Koestler, I think for many of the reasons above. Here are some books I recommend by him.<br />Darkness at Noon (novel)- about Soviet show trials. A classic of its time.<br />The Case of the Midwife Toad (out of print)- about the virtual character assassination of the scientist Kammerer and his startling experiments about evolution.<br />The Ghost in the Machine - Like Synchronicity, this gave its name to an album by The Police, and talks about the uncomfortable idea that the human brain may have dangerous self-destructive flaws in it, and that modern psychology (of that time of course) may have to reassess itself.<br />I would also recommend his essays such as Drinkers of Infinity, and The Heel of Achilles.	2001-01-30
