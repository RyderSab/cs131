US	52922389	R17VKO6TGNTYOC	0812967089	960148459	Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	A true story of The American Dream on speed	The book seems to be divided into two parts: the first, mania; the second, depression and recovery.      The first part is total mania, like a apeeding train rushing into trouble. He resists no impulse of any sort. 'Anything worth doing is worth overdoing' seems to be his credo. Impulse cash purchase of a round-trip ticket to Tokyo? Yes, he's done it.  Any possible tawdry activity in Times Square. Yes. Shopping himself into a guilty funk? ($8,000 in three hours on clothes.) That too.     He gets a high-paying job in the art world that fits perfectly with his mania. Now his incredible jetting around the world is a requirement of that job.    In the second part, wild cycles from elation to despair fill the pages. His solution involves the title -- electroshock. And lots of prescibed psychoactive drugs.    He must be one of the most medicated people on the planet, certainly for a mentally troubled person outside of a hospital.   He takes 15 pills every night -- nine diffrent drugs. Some of the drugs require he take other drugs. His anti-psychotic drug needs more pills to control its side effects.    Then, too, he becomes an electroshock abuser. He takes lots of the treatments, at least partly because he loves the anesthesia given beforehand!    This is both a fast-reading rollercoaster of a book and yet profondly sad. It's not a book of great insight, but at least to me, it seems an accurate narration of a scarey mental world.	2005-09-22

Finally, they have included one.  (They even put a disclaimer that this is merely an index of the directors of films included in the book, not a complete listing of all films by a given director. Was this why such a necessary index was omitted before, that it doesn't list all of a director's films?)    It's a little worrisome to me that a well-known film critic can put his name to a book series without a directors' index. I guess this book is just another income stream for Mr. Maltin. Consider the Martin guide, instead.	2005-09-18

(I have not read the Stu Ungar bio which must be even more poignant.) He gives a lot of the gritty details of his poker play.  Don't get me wrong: the tone isn't sad, but the game play is.    In fact, he admits he never does very well at the tables, and I can't tell if that's due to bad beats or his own bad play.      Instead, try the Moneymaker book which at least has an upbeat poker ending or Aces and Kings, about several well-known players.    Or read Positively Fifth Street by James McManus about his adventures in the WSOP Main Event.  It's not just upbeat; you can tell he understands the game.    P.S. Sparks has a new book out, Getting Lucky: the Education of a Mad Poker Player.  In it, the author admits his game needed help when wrote this book. (As he was coached by Tom McEvoy before he wrote his new book, I'm sure his game has become much better!) For those who think I was too harsh with Mr. Sparks, I did buy his new book.	2005-09-16

This is a 60-page overview of Texas Hold'em that surveys all aspects of the game from starting hands to postflop play and when to bluff. It discusses pot odds, bet odds and implied odds. There's a table in the back with the odds for your hand improving based on the outs you need.  There's even a few pages about tournament play.    It's standard stuff, but distilled down to essentials and graphically well-presented.     So why only 3 stars?    The book is filled with typos. Cards are described in the same sentence as spade [the symbol] and \\"s\\" -- but both things refer to the spade suit. (And \\"s\\" could well mean two starting cards of any one suit.)    On page 32, he explains that you _should_ call when you do not make your queen-high flush. Huh? I've been folding my missed flushes.    As Straham proclaims on the cover, the book is only \\"5 bucks.\\"  Maybe he should price the book higher and employ a proofreader.    P.S. After seeing that the glossary --incredibly -- is not alphabetized, I wish I had given the book only two stars.	2004-09-26

The detailed listing of many machines covers much of what you'll find at least in LV in banking-style machines and how to play them successfully. In my short playing time, I did come out ahead. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this book is out-of-print, but it can still be found.  Of course, I'm looking forward to a revised edition. <br /> <br />For more slot info, see The Slot Machine Answer Book by John Grochowski which covers a wider range of machines in less detail. It is written as questions and answers, which will either intrigue or annoy you. <br /> <br />Or read the classic, Break the One-Armed Bandits! by Frank Scoblete.  It's a chatty discussion of slot machine history, insider secrets and stories. There is a tell-all interview with \\"Mr. Handle,\\" the anonymous slot machine manager of a major Las Vegas casino. Overall, the book's main value lies in its sensible methods for finding loose slots. (On a one-day trip -- I know not that's statistically significant -- the book was right on the money.)	2004-08-18

There's a lot of clear explanations for lower-rated players as well as enough innovative lines that even GMs will need this book to tackle the Tromp.  In fact, Jeremy Silman has called this work &quot;magnificent&quot; and described it as simply the best opening text he's ever seen.<br />A question for me remains why the opening is so under-represented in MCO 14. It's covered in about three pages.<br />By the way, look at Wells' other opening books too: The Complete Semi-Slave and The Complete Richter-Rauzer. According to Mr. Silman, they set the standard for those openings as well.	2004-05-01

Topics covered include the 3-piece rule(brilliant!), technical vs. fighting chess, sacs and combinations, piece mobility, the initiative, and refuted attacks.<br />Highly recommended before longer works like Art of Attack by Vukovic.

If when a position breaks open, you're on the wrong end of nasty tactical shots, your position must have been weak to begin with.<br />This book teaches you to spot the weaknesses and strengths on the chessboard.  In a sense, it preaches what Silman does in Reassess Your Chess or Dvoretsky does in Attack and Defense and his other books. The difference is this is a concise, understandable shot-in-the-arm for those with positional malaise.  (Silman's information is excellent, but his here's-where-the-patzer-screwed-up approach is distracting. In contrast, Mr. Aagaard says here's where I screwed up ... and what I should have seen on the board.)<br />The writing style is conversational and involving. The positions are adequately diagrammed and well-chosen, for Aagaard chooses understandable positions, which are, nevertheless, crucial moments that lead to the outcome of the game.<br /> While Aagaard's previous book Excelling at Chess was all instructional text, more than half this book is positional exercises to study and solve with detailed solutions. (No mate-follows-in-20-moves notes.)<br />The previous book Excelling at Chess won a book of the year award at a chess website, and this book really should, too.	2004-03-22

Rather than analyzing brilliant sac players like Tal on a game-by-game basis, this focuses on sacs that occur on certain squares: in effect, the geography of effective sacrifices.  One common example is the bishop x h7+ sac, but LeMoir covers lots of powerful storm-the-barricade plays as well as the defenses against them, the follow-ups leading to their success and the positional ideas from which they spring.<br />One important quibble: these are bishop and knight sacs, so ideas like the c8 rook x c3 knight in several lines of the Sicilian are not covered. Maybe Mr. LeMoir will write a sequel covering major piece sacs.<br />Overall, this is a refreshing and useful book, perfectly suited to intermediate players or even lower-rated players tired of seeing their sac attempts refuted.<br />For more on these issues at the club player level, see Attacking Technique by Crouch, Storming the Barricades by Christiansen,  and LeMoir's other books -- How to Be Lucky in Chess (more about defense than attack) and How to Become a Deadly Chess Tactician.	2004-03-22

Mr. Jay is an excellent magician and an author of magic history books.<br />However, the reason this book is in such demand is that the photographs reveal you (or of course your lovely assistant) need not wear clothes to scale cards. This what one reviewer here called \\"wonderful, eye-catching photographs.\\" Fair enough, it's Playboy stuff.<br />Therefore, it is tough to know just how serious Ricky Jay is being here. (I have personally watched in magic shops, years ago, as young men magii tried to buy a copy of this book when it was in stock at its original list price. They failed due to the nude photographs.)<br />The used book prices of this title are crazy.	2004-01-07

If the book convinces you, you'll view all of it as solid fact.<BR>There are now 3 camps on the events of November 22, 1963: the Warren Commission believers who view Oswald as the lone gunman, followers of various conspiracy theories who say there was a second shooter but who regard the Z film as key evidence, and now the Z film hoax group  -- see the new Fetzer book by one of the other reviewers here --  who say there are several shooters but further postulate that the Zapruder film was faked.<BR>  This book traces the chain of custody of the original Zapruder film and all its earliest copies.  To me, it is convincing that the Zapruder film,  while several frames were damaged in processing, is not a fake. The film is never unaccounted for long enough to be substantially edited using advanced methods that leave no evidence of editing. (If it were faked, why release it with so convincing a portrayal of more than one shooter? A film so convincing that the Warren Commission has to explain away what appears to be a shot fired from the front.) <BR>     The speculative part of the book uses the Z film as evidence of a second shooter. The Warren Commission Report and its single bullet theory are disputed. (According to the book, the Z film supports the idea that Governor Connoly was hit by a bullet that never hit JFK. The entry wound in the president's back is too low to result in a throat exit wound and the injuries to Governor Connolly  -- all caused by one bullet on a downward path. This \\"single bullet\\" is moved by political forces, not ballistic ones.)  As many will be chanting \\"Oswald did it!\\" it is good that the book does not explore who the other shooter might be. Certainly, nothing in the photographic record can provide the identity of the mystery shooter.<BR>    This new book is a worthwhile addition to the assassination literature. It will have you looking at the Zapruder film with new insight.	2003-12-29

Doesn't this book sound like a battle plan for investment success, maybe one filled with value-based accounting lessons? It's not.<br />In fact, we are spared math, and we are not given practical counsel, either. That was what I looking for, as the title suggests. The title should be How Can The Smart Money Be So Dumb.<br />Instead, this is an interesting run-through of recent horror stories on Wall Street from the Internet bubble to IPO's to pro forma accounting and Enron. Behavioral finance is discussed here, but Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes by Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich is far superior.<br />Or read Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist by Roger Lowenstein. Or John Neff On Investing instead.<br />Mr. Cunningham is one of the new wave of Buffett explainers. (Where were you people 15 years ago when there was money to be made buying Berkshire?) And why does someone so incisive, so downhome funny as Mr. Buffett need so much explanation?? (Try Cunningham's The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America or the Berkshire Hathaway annual report.)<br />Unfortunately, the author lets slip his idea of a five-year holding period for stocks. That may turn out to be good advice, but which stocks would he choose to hold? We have no idea. (Tech stocks, big winners 2 years ago, have crashed back down to their 1997 prices.

Because it is a collection of short articles, it's a wide-ranging, readable discussion of many concepts: open vs. closed games,  mating nets, using the right rook, etc. For the beginner to intermediate  player, this book is a one-volume reference on playing better chess. Think  of it as an excellent &quot;second book&quot; after you know the pieces,  moves and notation.	1999-12-30
