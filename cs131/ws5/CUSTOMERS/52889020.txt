Nothing less. Although it is short, it bulges with deep and important insights; although it is aimed principally at an audience of professional economists, it is relevant for anyone interested in the scientific method as well as policy; and although it is written by a professional economist, its prose is splendid.<br />The chapter of the book that strikes me as most important is Chapter 4, \\"The Arrogance of Social Engineering.\\" The material here isn't simply another sermon on the complexity of the economy and society. It is, instead, a compelling explanation of why economists who make specific predictions about the future (\\"The price of tech stocks will rise over the next month\\" or \\"Megacorp's price-cutting will result in monopoly power\\") truly should be ignored.<br />And her conclusion!  That is not to be missed.  I especially like, and appreciate, her wise words of advice: \\"Know above all that you do not know.\\"	2002-07-10

Together, they explore the history and current state of government policy toward health care in the United States.  Each essay is clear and relevant.  And the proposals make great good sense.  Health care is far too important a service to be left in the hands of politicians and bureaucrats.  This book helps explain why.	2002-04-30

One reviewer even suggests that American capitalism has produced horrors of comparable magnitude.  Hmmm....  What might these depredations of capitalism be?  While capitalism has not and will not produce heaven on earth - no system ever will - the negative effects of capitalism that agitate its detractors are hardly comparable to the wholesale slaughtering of human freedom and human life achieved by every single communist regime.<br />Pipes argues eloquently and without a hint of hysteria that communism by its nature breeds tyranny.  It is not the only breeder of tyranny, of course, but it is certainly the gold medallist of tyrannical forces.<br />Pipes' humanity, his skill with words, and his deep knowledge of history make this little book a true gem.	2002-04-04

There are distressingly few such good books.  This book by David Henderson, though, is certainly one of these few.<br />The reader need not have ever studied economics to enjoy this book.  And even the reader who holds a PhD in the subject will not only enjoy this book, but will also learn from it -- learn how to communicate better as well gain even deeper insights into the ways markets and politics work.<br />One reason why economics is such an enduring subject is that continued reflection on its principles never stops deepening our understanding of the world.  David Henderson is among the very finest guides to the fascinating subject of economics.  I sincerely hope that all citizens will read this book -- and that all economists will read it twice.	2002-03-18

Communication talent of the sort possessed by Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell, and Walter Williams is too rare - and getting rarer as economic instruction becomes increasingly abstract.  But Roberts proves that not all economists under the age of 50 are incapable of bringing economics to life for a wide audience.<br />Roberts is truly a master at teaching the economic way of thinking - and teaching it in ways that almost anyone will find engaging and compelling.<br />As with his superb first book, THE CHOICE, Roberts here uses the dialogue to convey economic insights.  But unlike that first book, THE INVISIBLE HEART touches on an impressively wide array of subjects (rather than just international trade).  The reader learns solid reasons to be skeptical of today's shrieking environmental alarmists - solid reasons to question the effectiveness of government welfare programs - solid reasons for applauding, rather than condemning, corporations who set up factories paying market wages in third-world countries - indeed, solid reasons for even non-economists to think like economists.<br />Most importantly, the reader learns that good economists are the very last people to believe that money is all that matters.  Russell Roberts is unequaled in his ability to show that free markets generate not only impressive coordination and efficiency and material bounty, but also an unprecedented profusion of humane results.  The market's invisible hand works side by side with its equally robust invisible heart.<br />This book is an excellent introduction to economics and, more generally, to the philosophy of freedom.	2001-05-01

It's a terrific read.  Sowell's writing is crisp; his analytical powers are sharp.  I very much enjoyed reading Sowell's keen economic analyses of different phenomena.<br />BASIC ECONOMICS is, really, a more-accessible version of Sowell's magnificent KNOWLEDGE AND DECISIONS.<br />The book shows signs of being rushed into print -- several misspellings and one or two incomplete references in the endnotes.

Some go nowhere, while others soar.  Generally, the essays toward the beginning of the book -- those by David Landes, Michael Porter, and Carlos Montaner, especially -- are outstanding.  In contrast, the essays toward the end of the book are, generally, uninspired and uninspiring.<br />The theme of the volume is that culture matters.  The best half-dozen essays in this book (along with the nice Introduction by Lawrence Harrison) make a powerful case that culture does indeed matter.  It remains true that a generally accepted and precise definition of culture remains elusive; certainly, doing useful quantitative analyses of cultures is, as of now, only far off on the horizon.  But the imprecisions that still mark discussions and analyses of culture should not prejudice scholars against recognizing the large role that culture plays in determining economic outcomes.<br />Anyone who believes that economic outcomes are strictly determined by the laws and regulations enforced by a sovereign state should read this book.  He or she will have an almost-impossible task defending that position.	2001-01-01

His ECONOMIC WAY OF THINKING is justifiably renowned for being crystal clear, and his classroom instruction is famous.<br />This short book, published posthumously, is the best 100-page-or-less introduction to economics and the economic way of thinking that I've ever read.  Possessing a poet's economy and skill with words, Heyne conveys not only the basic tenents of modern economics, but he goes a long way toward explaining their historical origins.<br />The reader also sees on display in this monograph Paul Heyne's truly deep insight to economics and its subject matter.  Indeed, to explain economics as clearly, consisely, and beautifully as Heyne does requires a wisdom so profound that few economists ever come close to possessing it and the understanding that it makes possible.  Paul Heyne possessed such wisdom and understanding in abundance.<br />Even professional economists will gain by reading this book -- despite its being accessible to almost any reader.	2000-12-17

Sowell is a scholar whose works I've admired for twenty years.  I was pleased to learn, in the course of reading this book, that my favorite of Sowell's books - Knowledge and Decisions - is among his favorites of his own works.<br />All that this book reveals about Sowell is consistent with what I'd previously known of him - for example, that he's uncompromising, crusty, and wholly unafraid to speak what he believes to be the truth.  But the book puts interesting bulk on my previously thin knowledge of the man, his background, and his experiences.<br />Nothing I learned about him from this book shocked me, although I didn't realize just how many scholarly institutions Sowell has been associated with.  Nor did I realize that Sowell's well-known disdain for the modern academy dates back to his earliest years in college.  He did not, contrary to my previous assumption, grow disgruntled with academic life only in the 1970s.<br />True to lifelong form, Sowell did not write this book in an effort to win hugs and kisses.  As this book makes quite clear, he's obviously not a huggable guy, and nor does he care to be.  But he is a genuinely courageous man of integrity, in addition to being a fine scholar.<br />For years I had the final lines of his Knowledge and Decisions taped to my office door.  They nicely capture a principal theme of his policy works: \\"Freedom is not simply the right of intellectuals to circulate their merchandise.  It is, above all, the right of ordinary people to find elbow room for themselves and a refuge from the rampaging presumptions of their `betters.'\\"<br />Bravo for Thomas Sowell!  May he live and work for many decades to come.	2000-11-22

It is, I believe, the very best short work that punctures the prevailing myth of the robber barons.  As Folsom shows, many of the most reviled \\"robber barons\\" were incredible benefactors of humankind - J. D. Rockefeller included. <br />Folsom's chapter on Rockefeller is a special gem.  In a few pages, Folsom demonstrates what a truly remarkable human being Rockefeller was.  Everyone in the industrialized world today would be noticeably less-well-off had J. D. Rockefeller not lived, or if he had lived in a time and place that would have snuffed out his incredible entrepreneurial creativity.<br />Not all late-19th-century businessmen were admirable.  Folsom capably identifies the most notable \\"political entrepreneurs\\" (Folsom's term).  Political entrepreneurs made their fortunes by manipulating the political process - by persuading or cajoling government to transfer wealth from politically weak parties to themselves.  Market entrepreneurs, in contrast, earned their fortunes by making consumers and workers better off.<br />This is a superb work of business and economic history.	2000-09-29

Todd Buchholz gives his readers a good, well-written introduction to most of the major schools of economics.  His portraits of the \\"dead economists\\" who launched and powered these various schools are excellent, as are his summaries of each of these schools.  (Fortunately, not all of Buchholz's \\"dead economists\\" are dead: Ronald Coase, Milton Friedman, James Buchanan, and Robert Lucas, among others, are thankfully still alive.)<br />I will recommend this book to non-economists who ask me for an accessible introduction to economic analysis.<br />Only a few nits are worth picking.  One is that, from time to time, Buchholz mentions an interesting fact without providing a reference.  For example, in his chapter on Public Choice economic, he illustrates the reality and size of pork-barrel politics by reporting the finding of an (unnamed) researcher who \\"calculated that for the price of the $200 billion highway bill [enacted by Congress  in 1998], the U.S. could literally pave the streets with gold (gold-plating, that is).\\"  I wanted to check out this study, but could find no citation to it.<br />Another nit is that, again in his chapter on Public Choice economics, he should have introduced his readers to the term, and concept, of rent-seeking.<br />A third (and really small) nit is that he mistakenly reports that Thomas Sargent shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in economics with Robert Lucas.  Not so.  Sargent is not, at least yet, a Nobel laureate.<br />Especially nice are (1) Buchholz's exploration of Keynes's attitude toward government, (2) his explanation of the deepest problems with Marxian economics, and (3) his very able treatment of rational-expectations economics.  But please don't read this paragraph as suggesting that Buchholz performs well only in these areas.  Again, from beginning to end, this is a very sound and very useful effort.	2000-09-25

Only the past 15 or so years have  witnessed a sprinkling of serious Public-Choice-type research into the  actual history and operation of antitrust regulation.  Bill Shughart is one  of leaders of this work.  And this book is one of the very first (perhaps  THE first) book-length investigation of antitrust from a Public Choice  perspective.<br />What Shughart reports is both compelling and distressing.   It's compelling because he has empirical evidence as well as sound theory  on his side. It's distressing because this evidence and theory together  point to the fact that antitrust in America is not a means of keeping  market competitive but, rather, a means of taking wealth from those who are  less politically influential (generally, consumers) and giving it to those  who are politically effective.  In short, antitrust is used principally to  monopolize markets.<br />If you believe that antitrust is a noble,  pro-consumer, pro-competition policy, Shughart will persuade you to think  otherwise.  Especially when read in along with the collection of essays  that he edited, with Fred McChesney, in 1995 (The Causes and Consequences  of Antitrust), this book reveals the true purpose of antitrust.  It ain't a  happy revelation -- but it is a vital one.	2000-09-19

He is a first-rate economist; he writes beautifully  and cleverly; he is learned; and his subjects are germane.<br />PURSUING  HAPPINESS is a terrific book.  Lebergott reviews the history of consumption  opportunities under capitalism.  Like Julian Simon, and Mike Cox &amp; Rick  Alm, he finds that the material well-being of ordinary Americans has  skyrocketed during the 20th century.  To compare American living standards  at the close of the 20th century to those at the beginning of the 20th  century is to discover an explosion of wealth so vast that we who today  enjoy this astonishing wealth can scarcely imagine what life was like for  our ancestors of just 100 years ago.<br />Today, we have many more things --  and much more time (both because we live longer and because we have more  leisure), improved health, greater learning, and a richer menu of  entertainments.  Lebergott shows also that capitalism has been especially  good for the working classes and for women.  For example, he documents the  extraordinarily burdensome and time-consuming tasks that nearly all women  100 years ago did routinely to keep their households running.  Today,  almost all such tasks are farmed out or mechanized.  (In one of his many  brilliant lines, Lebergott notes that &quot;By the 1980s, only a handful of  hippies expected their womenfolk to haul water from the brook or  well.&quot;)<br />No one who comments upon the course of the American economy  should be without this book.	2000-09-17

I'm delighted to see  that a new edition has been issued.<br />Demos shatters many of our  impressions of 17th-century Puritans - for example, the impression that  Puritans were sexually repressed.  More interesting, though, is Demos's  compelling demonstration of just how difficult life was for early Plymouth  colonists.  An example: privacy within the home, of the sort that we today  take for granted, was not enjoyed by Plymouth's settlers.  (The reason for  this fact is that the houses of the settlers were quite small, their  families quite large, and most of each person's life was spent very close  to his or her home.)  Also, by today's standards, childbirth was incredibly  dangerous: it killed one in five women.  Infant mortality high, too, at  about one in ten.  And the wide choice of occupations that we moderns enjoy  was unavailable to the Plymouth's settlers.<br />This book is well-researched  and well-written.  To read it is to learn more about life in early colonial  North America.  But reading it also provides important perspective for  evaluating the immense material prosperity that the institutions bequeathed  to us by these settlers - most importantly, private property - have made  possible.  We today are indeed fortunate.	2000-09-04

Neither happened.<br />Essential to  Blau's case for greater government intervention and more &quot;economic  democracy&quot; is his factual claim that recent prosperity is an illusion,  save for all but the richest Americans.  He cites familiar statistics and  studies purporting to prove that the average American household reached its  peak of earning power in 1973 -- and that it's been downhill ever since.  (At one point Blau actually says that prosperity of the sort that Americans  knew during the first 30 years following WWII has &quot;disappeared without  a trace.&quot;  Is he serious?)<br />From time to time, Blau seems to  recognize the many problems that have been pointed out with the data he  relies upon, but his efforts to meet those objections are weak.  More  importantly, Blau totally ignores the important research done by economists  showing that the average American worker's ability to consume almost all  goods and services available on the market is greater today than it was at  any time in the past -- including 1973.<br />If you're looking for  well-researched, well-written books that offer clear pictures of the change  in American living standards over the years, Blau's book isn't one.   Instead, read W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, MYTHS OF RICH &amp; POOR  (Basic Books, 1999), and Stanley Lebergott, PURSUING HAPPINESS (Princeton  University Press, 1993).  These books are written by economists who know  how to use, evaluate, and report empirical data.<br />In short, no serious  person who evaluates the evidence objectively can conclude that the average  American worker hasn't enjoyed substantial improvements in living standards  over the past quarter century.  Indeed, even those tiny handful of  Americans (about 5%) who never move out of the lowest income-earning  quintile have enjoyed significant increases in their ability to purchase  almost all goods and services available on the market.<br />In addition to  painting a woefully distorted picture of reality, Blau's theoretical  arguments display a grave failure to grasp the most basic economic  principles.  For example, in arguing against free trade, he naively assumes  that &quot;business&quot; is a great monolith -- monolithically in favor of  free trade because free trade gives it access to cheap labor.<br />But on  trade issues there is no monolithic business interest.  Some businesses  favor free trade because it promises them greater profits, while other  businesses oppose free trade because it will subject them to greater  competition.  Ask USX if it supports free trade in steel.  The answer  you'll get is a resounding &quot;no!&quot;  Ask American sugar farmer if  they support freer trade in sugar.  Again, &quot;no!&quot;  Ask U.S.  airlines if they're willing to let foreign air carriers transport  passengers on domestic U.S. routes.  &quot;Not a chance!&quot;<br />In truth,  business people have been among the greatest and most successful opponents  of free trade throughout history.  To assume, as Blau does, that free trade  helps business at the expense of workers and consumers is among the most  tired and well-refuted objections to free trade.<br />Countless other flaws  mar this book.  I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone read it.	2000-08-19

I'm glad that I didn't.  It's  absorbing, moving, and thoughtful.<br />With no experience with, or knowledge  of, mental illness, I can't vouch for the veracity of Lamb's portrayal of  either Thomas Birdsey's illness or of the manner in which mental-health  authorities and physicians deal with such illnesses (and with the families  of the mentally ill).  But Lamb's portrayal of these matters certainly is  plausible.<br />I've only one, small nit to pick: in his acknowledgements,  Lamb not only thanks the National Endowment of the Arts for its financial  support, but remarks that such support somehow affirms the worth of his  novel -- gives it, to quote Lamb, &quot;validation.&quot;<br />Why should an  artist -- particularly one as gifted as Wally Lamb -- look to the  government for validation of the worth of his work?  It saddens and scares  me that anyone reckons Uncle Sam to possess the authority to validate, or  not, artists' products.	2000-08-19

As is true of everything he writes, Frank's style here is clear and engaging.<br />He aims to show that human emotions are created by natural selection to increase the individual's  chances of survival.  What appear to be a person's irrational reactions and  inclinations often promote mutually beneficial trade and, thus, promote  that person's long-run welfare.  The explanation of how emotions achieve  this remarkably beneficial outcome is the core of this fine book.<br />Of all  the many serious books that I've read over the years, this one is surely  among the most fun!  It's fantastic reading.	2000-06-25

It won't be the last.<br />   Pipes shows -- with a style that is as engaging and as smooth as any that I've ever read -- that private property rights are  essential to the maintenance of human dignity, human flourishing, liberty,  and widespread prosperity.  He does so not just with economics (although  his understanding of economics is deep), but with history.  And it is the  history of private property rights that ultimately convinces the skeptic  that such rights are indispensable for the good society.<br />   As with any  great book, nits can be picked with this one.  But all are minuscule.  This  is a remarkable and learned book.	2000-01-14

These guys' work is truly and deeply impressive.  And their  writing is a joy to read.<br />They tackle some of the most challenging issues  at play in modern economics -- and they succeed brilliantly!  Because of  the research these two scholars produced earlier in this decade, it is  inexcusable for anyone to trot out the success of the QWERTY keyboard or  that of the VHS tape as examples of &quot;inefficient lock-in.&quot;   Because of the research they have done, and report clearly, in this new  book, it is now inexcusable for anyone to claim that Microsoft's market  success is due exclusively -- or even principally -- to  &quot;path-dependency&quot; or &quot;inefficient lock-in.&quot;<br />Liebowitz  and Margolis show beyond any reasonable doubt that in those markets where  Microsoft achieves and maintains a large market share, it does so by  offering consumers deals that consumers fine attractive.

The authors convincingly argue that, because no single vote in a democratic election is likely to determine the outcome of the election, each voter is  free to vote according to his or her ideological lights -- that is, each  voter is likely to elevate ideological considerations over material ones.  Insofar as ideological considerations run counter to a voter's material  interests, the Brennan-Lomasky insight is that we cannot predict the  outcome of elections merely by identifying the dominant material interest  shared by a majority of voters.<br />This insight is often interpreted as  rejecting the public-choice assumption that people behave  self-interestedly.  But it does no such thing.  When it is realized that  each voter's vote is inconsequential (as far as the outcome of the election  goes), each voter is free to &quot;consume&quot; ideology.  As I see it,  the Brennan-Lomasky thesis conforms more fully with public-choice  fundamentals than does the previous notion that voters always (or  typically) vote their narrow material interests.<br />This book is one of the  most important works in political science, and public-choice, published  during the past quarter century.	1999-09-29

Unweaving the Rainbow is no  exception.  And his ability to tease insights from his deep understanding  of natural selection inspires awe.<br />I don't share what I infer to be  Dawkins's left-ish political views.  So on those rare occasions when he  inserts a politically inspired remark, I wince a bit.  But these infrequent  instances aside, my mind and spirits soar when I read his work.<br />Dawkins  has both the courage and, more importantly, the intellectual mettle to  distinguish unfailingly between a scientific argument and a foolish or  baseless argument.  Such courage and mettle are distressingly rare, even  among many celebrated thinkers.  If you want to be inspired by the power of  the human mind, and the beauty of arguments well-crafted, read this book --  and then treat yourself to his other works.	1999-09-26

John Lott's book offers what is far and away  the most extensive and intensive empirical analysis of the new wave of  game-theoretic predation theories that first emerged in the early 1980s.   Lott uses ingenious empirical tests (guided by carefully reasoned  economics) to see if these new theories hold water.

While I agree with the reviewer below who suggests that this is not the book to read if  you're interested exclusively in the the technical features of Nash's  mathematical contributions, I believe that this criticism is misplaced.   The book (it seems to me) is intended for an intelligent lay audience; it  doesn't pretend to be a survey of his scientific accomplishments and  failures.<br />I was especially struck by the truly immense amount of  competition that exists among math scholars for status.

Higgs skillfully and carefully tests this thesis against  history.  The thesis stands.  Governments do indeed exploit crises as  opportunities to confiscate ever-greater powers.  After each crisis, the  amount of power recently added to government's stock might shrink somewhat,  but very seldom back to what it was prior to the crisis.

With this book, Virginia Postrel takes her place along side Rose Wilder Lane, Isabel Paterson, and Ayn Rand as the 20th century's greatest  heroines of liberty. Postrel's book is scholarly, very well researched, and  clearly written. Like the philosophy she advocates, her book is dynamic. It  is a unique combination of ideas drawn from a wide range of fields --  including, but not limited to, economics, history, management, law,  political science, psychology, and biology. Moreover, as others have  commented, Postrel's distinction between &quot;dynamists&quot; and  &quot;stasists&quot; is wonderfully useful. This fresh distinction shows  clearly that the tired distinction between &quot;liberal&quot; and  &quot;conservative&quot; is not only useless, but downright poisonous to  constructive discourse.<br />This is one of my favorite books of all time.	1999-05-18

Hazlitt brilliantly shows that, in fact, utilitarianism is compatible with rights-based theorizing.  Hazlitt's conclusion is that  ethical actions are those that promote social cooperation -- and that human  beings are naturally predisposed to cooperate with each other.  The most  potent force working against such cooperation is the state.  Hazlitt's  prose is smooth, clear, and compelling.  I think that no better book on  ethics has ever been written.	1999-02-19

The authors shatter this myth.   There is nothing at all left to this myth when Cox and Alm are done with  it.  Anyone who from now on repeats this myth can justly be accused either  of inexcusable ignorance or of willful misreading of the facts.  The book  is well written, and the authors obviously thought deeply about how to  present empirical data clearly. They succeeded marvelously!  The tables and  charts alone are worth the price of the book.

Unfortunately, he far too uncritically accepts the mythical  notion that antitrust legislation was enacted in response to increasing  monopolization of the U.S. economy.  Peritz ignores the large (and still  growing) body of research showing that Standard Oil, the Chicago  meatpackers, U.S. Steel, and other firms vilified in popular histories in  fact promoted competitive markets -- these firms dramatically reduced  prices, improved their operating and distribution efficiencies, and  consistently increased the quality of the goods they offered to consumers.   With his incorrect understanding of economic history, Peritz's explanations  of the origins and role of antitrust legislation and case law are, largely,  unfounded.	1999-02-12

With THE CHOICE, Russell Roberts has written the 20th-century's finest, most eloquent, most unique, most accessible, and deepest defense of free trade.  Even though I'm trained as an economist, and despite having taught  international trade for many years, I learned much when I read this  104-page work.  For example, never have I read an explanation of the  optimal tariff (and of its limitations) that is as clear as that which is  presented in THE CHOICE.

This book is written in the great classical-liberal tradition that motivated the American revolution  and the drafting of America's 1787 Constitution.  Buchanan and Tullock saw  themselves as putting into modern economic language the insights and wisdom  of James Madison and Co.  The book does indeed counsel skepticism of big  government, and it is no great fan of unlimited democracy.  But the authors  come to this position because they understand that even democratic  governments can be tyrannical and that a depoliticized society -- governed  largely by private property rights -- promises peace, prosperity, and  cultural flourishing.  Few books on economics are as original and  insightful as is The Calculus of Consent -- and it remains as fresh in 1999  as it was when first published in 1962.	1999-02-12

With The Noblest Triumph, Tom Bethell helps in a big way to reverse the  unfortunate effects of this misbegotten charity.   Bethell's book bursts  with sound history, first-rate economics, and a subtle and profound  philosophical understanding of human society.  His is one of the clearest  explanations of why the rule of law -- the unbiased application of legal  constraints to even the mightiest citizens -- is necessary for freedom and  prosperity.  Bethell also masterfully lands solid blows against the (sadly  widespread) notion that majoritarian democracy is a sound means of making  law.   Bethell's lesson, in brief, is that a system of decentralized  private property rights is far superior to any form of centralized  government at ensuring peaceful and productive social relations.   While  explaining in a variety of ways the role of property rights, The Noblest  Triumph is far more than a book about property rights.  Read this book and  enjoy a first-rate intellectual feast.	1999-02-12

What distinguishes Ridley's book from the pack is his explicit grappling with the question: What does the fact that human moral sentiments are crafted by natural selection imply about the appropriate political order?  Ridley presents one of the finest challenges to Thomas Hobbes yet written.  According to Ridley, modern scientific research shows that Hobbes was wrong to assume that in the absence of an all-powerful government people would brutalize each other.  While each person does indeed have within himself or herself an irreducible core of self-interest, this very self-interest is typically best served by cooperating with others rather than preying on others.       In Ridley's view -- which I find convincing -- all that is necessary to channel self-interested sentiments into socially cooperative patterns of behavior is a system of private and freely exchangeable property rights.  The government that governs least truly does, on this reading, govern best.	1997-12-17
