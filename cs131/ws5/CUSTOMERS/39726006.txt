When the 'brouhaha' began with Fox Network upon it's release, it made me wonder what they were so worried about (truly, not just an 'infringement' on their slogan), and what they wanted to keep hidden?<br />From page one, I waas hooked. It is not a 'humorous' book, but more of an entertaining, and dare I say 'honest' book, educating the reader into what is really going on in the media world today. With a sense of humor (but not the &quot;Aren't I hilarious?&quot; wink dominant in comedian's books these days), and seriousness, Franken successfully enlightens the reader as to the stunts and structure the media is paralyzed by these days. He explains with deftness and clarity, what the mouthpieces are telling us - and what it all actually means; very helpful to those like myself who find them utterly boring yet boggling. He tears apart percentage charts, flowcharts, and various economic tables - for the benefit of showing the reader that much of what is being fed to us is bull. He does it all with earnest and sincerity.<br />Bravo! to Fox News; for giving Franken the kind of publicity money can't buy (and encouraging readers like myself to read the books we first dismissed). Encore! to Franken; let us hope this is not the last. Certainly, one of 2003's &quot;Best of Books&quot;.	2003-11-28

I for one, an admitted huge Summer fan for over twenty years, waited with great anticipation for this book's release. After all, Summer is a gifted entertainer; an admirable songwriter (for herself and others), a hit recording artist (she holds the 'record' for many Billboard categories which haven't been broken in the past two decades); and an accomplished painter. &quot;Gifted author&quot;, she is not.<br />Her career has been a hodgepodge of triumphs and tragedies, both personal and profesional. She has crossed paths in her career with some of the 'greats' - including Streisand and Springsteen, among many others in the music industry. Still, one would never know this from her book.<br />Summer triumphed to superstardom in the 70s, with the advent of the 'disco era' (which has successfully spun off today's 'dance' and 'club' genres), yet endured her slate of disappointments (her much publicicized split with Casablanca Records in 1980). This she does discuss to some degree, in the first two-thirds of her 'thin' book. Yet, the 80s and 90s were not too good for Summer professionally (her split with Geffen Records, her lawsuit against a tabloid for the infamous 'AIDS' rumour, her fall from radio playlists, an endless search for her new label, her more recent subsequent split with Sony Music; this - nearly two decades of her career - is hardly mentioned at all. Even her much-discussed Broadway musical (some five years in the making and at an indefinite halt, according to other sources) barely gets covered. She talks about her preparation of it, but not what's keeping it off the stage (is it lack of funding? is it subject matter?). Her duet with Streisand is four pages of nothing more than adoration (&quot;I think she's great!&quot; Summer coos), but no mention of when she covered for Streisand at the 1984 Oscars (isn't that a memorable event worth writing about?), or if there's a friendship between the two today. Same with Springsteen (who worked on her 1982 album); a bit of cooing and nothing else.<br />What we do know is her religious beliefs (admittedly, she doesn't over-do it with religion, and what she does discuss flows evenly through the book), and what a great parent she is to her three kids (at times it makes the reader embarassed for her lack of humility in this matter).<br />This won't go down in history as the worst autobiography from a musical diva (that disinction goes to Diana Ross for 1993's &quot;Secrets of a Sparrow&quot;), but it comes awfully close.	2003-10-20

However, about 85% of this skimpy (165 pages) journal is about his transformation into an 'oddity' rather than the uglier duckling (or as he says on the last pages; from a scale of 1-10 he went from a 1 to a 5). The other 15% is just filler...dropping a celebrity name here and there in bold print, mind you (he must have smartly sensed the average reader would be skimming this dread, and really, there's not much to skim). Literally, that is all there is - until he shares his new-found wisdom on the last page; &quot;beauty is only skin deep - it's what's inside that counts&quot;. Truly profound.<br />How anyone can make experiences on the Red Carpet seem so lifeless and dull is beyond me. On the book jacket, it says that this is Cojocaru's first book. Hopefully, it will be his last.	2003-09-26

After reading Mistry's latest, there should be no doubt in any reader's mind why Mistry has been hailed as one of the most important writers of the 21st Century.<br />Keeping the formula of his earlier works (&quot;Such a Long Journey&quot;, &quot;A Fine Balance&quot;), Mistry takes a small group of people and forms their characters in the simplest ways: by dialogue, actions and re-actions. By doing so, he unravels a splendid story which everyone can relate to, in their own personal interpretation. Though the formula is repeated in each of his novels, it does not grow stale because of his masterful, emotional storytelling. A winning novel in every respect.	2003-02-05

Weiner's sophomore effort should not disappoint believers of her debut novel, GOOD IN BED. She plays it safe - very safe - by even as going as far as bringing in the Cannie Shapiro character from her first novel, to let readers know she (Weiner) hasn't strayed from her formula. And that disappoints readers like myself, who enjoyed Weiner as a writer (America's Maive Binchey ?), but didn't love the plot. As with her debut novel, IN HER SHOES once again comes across as a good idea for a network sitcom - saccharine sweet, lighthearted, inoffensive, uneventful, and rather brain numbing.	2002-12-30

Seems Ross forgot about the successful sixties, as well as the latter part of her stalled career (as well as the 'plumper', older Ross we have seen of late) picking and choosing to create her own revised history. For laughs (I hope!) she throws in such gems as: &quot;All the while that I move forward, I make way for reflection&quot;, &quot;My parents gave me the right name&quot;, and &quot;My self said, it is time to cease playing it safe, create new realities, dare adventures, be boss.&quot; It's too bad she listened to herslef.	2002-12-26

While reading this book, I couldn't help but surmise that Sebold had her eye on Oprah Winfrey, in hopes that Winfrey would pick this book for her (now defunct) book club, and make Sebold's debut a best-seller. After all, the book is a paint-by-number exercise in writing an \\"Oprah Best-Seller\\" with all the main ingredients: a brutal rape and murder of a child, the 'distant' mother paired with  the 'too-loving' father, the un-gluing of a suburban family in the face of tragedy, alcoholism, despair, and of course, dysfunction. At times, I thought I already read this book; indeed I did, only it was Oprah's pick  \\"Fall on Your Knees\\", \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\", etc. Without a doubt, Sebold had her eye on the Oprah trophy while writing this. However, Sebold's book was published in July, 2002...months after Oprah closed her Book Club for good. No matter; her audience was thirsty for another depressing novel - with or without Oprah's help - and this book seems to have fit the bill.

For those of you who like  to read a McMystery or a Legal Lite (a James Patterson book, or Grisham's latest), this book is not for you. For those who are willing to to indulge in a lengthy (650 pages), well-written, engrossing, legal-mystery novel - indulge!<br />What you won't find in Carter's book is the sarcastic dialogue, an over-indulgence of profanity and/or sex, a see-through plot, and cliched caricatures which you can find in just about any book (Grisham's and Patterson's included) described as a legal-thriller today.<br />What you will find, instead, is intelligent conversations, no profanity, no sex (love, instead), a story-line that will keep you guessing, beautifully crafted individuals (characters), lush scenery which transports the reader, and a remarkable new writer (Stephen Carter).<br />Carter goes against the grain of most of the best-sellers of today, by taking the time to involve the reader. By the end of the book, you know who these charcters are (and there are plenty to know); their emotions,  what motivates them, what their passions are, where there morals lie. These are characters that belong to this book, this author...they're not the cliched caricatures you can pop out of a Grisham book and stick into a Patterson book (and the reader will be none the wiser). The sasme goes for the dialogue between each person, as well as the beautiful scenery, which for the most part concentrates on New England (CT and Martha's Vineyard), as well as DC. You will not read this book in a day, as you can a McMystery, for this book is not fast-food, but a gourmet feast...one to devour page by page over a period of time.  A winning novel in all respects.	2002-11-18

Alas, it wasn't worth the wait at all.<br />The book is broken into three parts; the movie, post-movie to pre-musical, and the musical. The movie gets the most in-depth coverage, because the movie is the most definitive. There's not much he can tamper with there, since most of it has been discussed before. Still, most of what he reports as fact is really a 'he says/she says'. The 'post-movie/pre-musical' is incosequential filler... rambling pages of nonsense. He talks about everything from the many attempts at turning the movie into a Broadway musical (Swanson's idea, originally), to television adaptions, to projects 'influenced' by \\"Sunset Boulevard\\". There's quite a bit there, yet not much to say. Finally, we get to the Andrew Lloyd Webber mega-musical. As anyone familiar with the play knows, there were times when the 'back-stage' scandals threatened to over-shadow the production itself. Yet Staggs just touches upon the most-reported (the Glenn Close/Patti Lupone fiasco, the Streisand recordings, the opening-night fiascos), and stays away from the less-reported-yet-juicier stuff (the Barbara Walters 'scandal', Diahann Carroll's vocal troubles). Not much research seems to have been taken, for these incidents surely would have surfaced.<br />Overall, Staggs fills his book with the mundane and rhetoric. Even his 'side-bars' become distracting drivel (do we really need to know his opinion on Streisand playing Norma Desmond in the often-talked about movie version?), taking away from what could have been  a more enjoyable stroll down the Boulevard.	2002-11-11

For everyone else - you're in for a mixed bag.<br />This is my third Shreve book, having first enjoyed (Oprah's choice) &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot;, and then snoozing through most of &quot;The Last Time They Met&quot;. So how does &quot;Weight&quot; hold up? Let me say Shreve is a masterful storyteller; as with each of her books I read, she is able to take a rather mundane story, and twist it into it's surprise ending. Like her other books, &quot;Weight&quot; gives the reader a situation set in the present, tightly woven to a parallel story/history from the past.<br />Easy and enjoyable enough, you'd say, but it's Shreve's writing style which can be a major distraction. One sentence is 'dialogue' from the future, while the adjoining sentence (in the same paragraph, mind you) is from the past. This may be her way of weaving the two stories tighter together, however at first it comes off as confusion, until you fit in to her rhythmn. Needless to say, there's also a lot of 'filler' that slows down, rather than advances the novel - another staple to most of Shreve's works.<br />For those who make it to the end, you're in for an enjoyable surprise, as with all of Shreve's books.	2002-11-03

The characters are enjoyable enough, yet not enough to make this a page-turner for me; for I wasn't all that excited about what was going to happen next to heroine Cannie Shapiro and her co-horts. And there lies the problem. The book comes across more as a script for the latest failed network sitcom...a group of characters you don't mind getting together with once a week, for a trial-run.

This is such a book. Moore-Campbell is a magnificent writer; her verses poetic, her theme universal. Her autobiogrophy tells the story of growing up black and young without a full-time father, and the affects it can have on a child. It's not just her story; she shares this life with her cousin Michael (again, young and black without a full-time father), their Mothers, Grandmothers, Aunts, and assorted 'father figures': Dads, Uncles, Reverands, Neighbors. One child (BeBe) can learn to adapt graciously, while the other (Michael) has a tougher time, as they each learn difficult 'truths' about their patriarchy.

Despite spectacular story telling and creative writing, I was disappointed - it went on far too long than it should have. This being my second JCO find, I was apprehensive about reading it. I'm glad I did.<BR>  Compelling, and wonderfully written, \\"Beasts\\" shows where Oates hits her stride - in tighter, more comprehensive writing. It's the type of book that is short (most will call it a novella), but filled with more than a full length novel such as \\"Mulvaneys\\". Her smaller chorus of characters, with their own individuality, are drawn together by a common link that carries the reader. Despite it's common characteristics of despair and dysfunction, etc., it is the type of book that leaves you wanting more, drawing your own conclusions, and begging you to read it once again. <BR>  'Go for the jugular' as one character says often enough.

The mother's (Salome) story is told going forward; while the daughter's (Camilla) story is told backward in time...and never the two do meet. By far, Salome's story is more exciting...a young Dominican girl growing up during political strife (in the 1800s), becoming a renowned poetess of political during political upheavel. Lively, humorous, and never disuaded in getting her point across, Salome is a pure joy to get to know. Her daughter's story starts in 1960 (as she retires as a university professor)and told backwards...and this is where the novel loses steam. Unfortunately for the reader, Alvarez has created a rather dull, uninteresting character in Camilia (a dowdy, closeted lesbian) who never seemed to enjoy - or at least - feel comfortable in life. This tends to slow down the pace quite a bit, but redemption is not far away if you can make it to the proceeding chapter which bounces back to Salome's story. Supporting characters ( sisters, brothers, husbands, wives, step-mothers, friends, etc.) bring life to this story, as well. At the end of the novel it left me wanting for more, and thinking: What if the mother and daughter lived in each other's place and time (Salome in the 20th Century would have been wonderful!)? Definitely, worth it to spend time with this family.	2002-07-20

However, I was a bit hesitant. How many times have I been so disappointed with such hyped-up books in the past? (Most recently, &quot;Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; comes to mind!) This time around, I was SO not disappointed.<BR>      These two extraordinary new authors have written a gem; an often-hilarious look at a year in the life of a young college girl (Nanny), and her job as a nanny to an upper-crust Manhattan family of three. Instead of becoming a monotonous, mean-spirited, dull history of her daily routine, we are enchanted by the whimsical tale of the trials and tribulations of our heroine, her young four-year-old charge (Grayer), and his socialite parents (Mr. and Mrs. X). The characters become real people (they could have easily fallen into caricatures by the wrong writer); those we like, we dislike, or are indifferent towards, but, nonetheless, those we probably have run into whenever we're in public. Often, the book is filled with laugh-out-loud pages from the witty writing style of the authors. This keeps the flow of the book going at a rapid pace; which at times makes it hard to put down.<BR>     There has been some discussion on how the book ends; certainly the last few pages didn't make me laugh...they almost made me cry. What can I say? A perfect, realistic ending to a perfect book. More from these two gals - and SOON!	2002-06-22

No, No!	\\"You MUST read this book!\\" I was told time and time again, usually with a scrap of paper and the title scribbled on it. \\"Even though you're a guy - read it! You'll love it!\\". So finally I got it...and read it...and didn't particularly love it. I liked it - somewhat. Yet, with all the hype surrounding it (from SO many people), I wanted to love it. Why didn't I love it? Because the characters were no more than caricatures, the plot was plodding, the humor forced, and the ending could be seen by Helen Keller. Wells had her eye on the \\"Oprah Book Club\\" logo when writing this book, but (surprise!) the book isn't depressing enough to warrant Oprah's stamp of approval. Which is why I liked it - somewhat. Lately, people have been telling me \\"You MUST see this new movie! You'll love it!\\" with a title scribbled on a piece of paper. Guess what the title is?	2002-06-16

With all the brouhaha engulfing this book before its release, I was expecting a Christina Crawford type of bio on JFK JR., from some greedy, would-be author looking for a fast buck. Alas, what I found was an enjoyable, if a tad redundant, book chronicling the brief life of GEORGE Magazine...the ins and outs, the ups and downs, of a struggling magazine, and the hands-on involvement of its celebrity founder, JFK, Jr. Not that the writer (Richard Blow) does not have faults: as a seasoned writer, Blow tells us the obvious (who can't guess that the sinking magazine was thrown a life-preserver numerous times thanks to JFK, Jr.'s position at the helm; or that the handsome Kennedy turned heads on every street in Manhattan )without much excitement. His over-use of metaphors (there isn't a situation that Blow can't describe without the words \\"...like a...\\" for emphasis) does drown the reader. What is intriguing, though, is Blow's admiration and affection for JFK. I couldn't help playing Judy Garland's \\"You Made Me Love You\\" over and over in my mind whenever I read the detailed Kennedy/Blow encounters.	2002-06-16

Certainly not your standard celebrity-penned autobiography (as a matter of fact, hardly an autobiography at all), O'Donnell tells a story of an unusual experience she has had the past year or so, with flashes of her childhood thrown in from time to time. O'Donnell speaks from the heart in sharing this freakish story, with an equal balance of tears and laughter. She doesn't share all, nor go in to deep with either part of the book - her experience or her childhood - but still leaves the reader satisfied with what she tells. Perhaps at a later date, she will share another experience with more in-sight to just who she is. Much better as a writer than editor of the ill-conceived magazine which bears her name.	2002-05-19

From page one, Craig carries the reader through a delightful roller-coaster ride of emotions. Combining our hero's search for the truth (about his deceased mother) with the fairy tales (his Mother wrote) he can not escape, IN A DARK WOOD makes for an intriguing novel, sure to be on every critics \\"ten best\\" list come December. Please, more from Amanda Craig (she has a number of novels available in England, but not America)- and soon!	2002-05-12

My first (and only) Shreeve book up until now was &quot;The Pilots Wife&quot;, which I read in two days (and recommended to everyone). I was looking forward to reading this one, being so impressed with her other book. Alas, excitement turned to disappointment, which turned to boredom, until Part 3. I almost closed the book for good  before that, yet kept hearing about the &quot;surprise&quot; ending; which didn't surprise me much at all (pay attention to how parts 1 and 2 are written distinctively different from part 3), but did in fact delight me. Shreeve writes the final ending so beautifully, you end up forgiving her for dragging you through this book for 300+ pages.	2002-04-03

Transparent characters, one-line sarcastic dialogue (in place of conversation), and a thin plot makes you wonder if Grisham wrote this on his lunch hour. Certainly not one of his more intriguing works (anyone who couldn't figure out the villian in the first 30 pages?). Without a doubt, one of the year's WORST!	2002-04-03
