Nell had learned the hard way that she had nothing to offer a man. Her future was here, running her Arizona dude ranch...alone.<br />Then Tyler Jacobs arrived...a man who knew what it was like to be alone and alienated. He yearned to kiss away the pain he saw in Nell's deep brown eyes.<br />But Nell wasn't about to mistake kindess for love. Not again. Yet would denying her own desire destroy her one chance for happiness?<br /><br />\\"Tyler\\" is the third book in Diana Palmer's Long, Tall Texan's series. It is the story of Tyler Ballenger and Nell Regan. While not as delightful as the first two books, it is still quite charming. This story starts out with Tyler already working and living on Nell's ranch in Arizona. He has moved out here after both he and his sister, Shelby, lost their fortunes, due to their fathers poor choices before death. Nell has distanced herself from Tyler by the beginning of the story. You later find out it was due to Nell following Tyler around when he first arrived at the ranch. Tyler hadn't minded in the start, after all, he thought Nell just a young girl. When he finds out that Nell was a grown woman, Tyler gets angry. He makes some cutting remarks to Bell, Nell's housekeeper, without realizing that Nell is close by. Tyler suddenly doesn't like it, though, when Nell starts to withdrawal from him. Complicating matters is the constant visit from Nell's widowed sister-in-law, Marguerite, and the sudden arrival of Darren McAnders. McAnders was hired by Tyler, without realizing that he was a sore spot where Nell was concerned. Before McAnders arrived it seemed that Nell and Tyler were making strides in their relationship. Tyler gets fed up with trying to bring Nell out of her shell and tells her, that if she wants him in any way, she will have to come after him!<br />This is a lovely story and I would still recommend it to any romance reader or not. I especially love the scenes where Tyler gets sick and Nell is there to help him get better! The characters are very real in this story. I can see a bit of myself in Nell, where in the beginning she is very shy and timid and trying to grow out of that. While Tyler, is just a simple laid back cowboy, who's ready for some deep ties.ry and I would still recommend it to any romance reader or not.

He'd loved her, wanted to marry her...and his sweet dreams had blown away. A Ballenger wasn't good enough for Shelby--she'd broken their engagement and flaunted her rich society lover in Justin's face. He vowed never again to be vulnerable to his beautiful Texas rose.<br /><br />Shelby had never stopped loving dark, intense Justin, and seeing him only deepened her feelings. She was sure he despised her, but she knew he needed to hear the truth about the past. She was risking everything, but the heart of her lonesome cowboy was more than worth it...<br /><br />It was tragic seeing so many misunderstandings between Justin and Shelby. They were sweet hearts torn apart with lies and deceit. For six years afterwards they have both been lonely and heartbroken. When, under difficult situations, the two decide to get married out of necessity, there seems to be some hope of a true reunion. Yet with hidden fears on both their parts it is a difficult start. Everytime the couple seems to turn a new corner, and things appear brighter, Justin misinterprets the situation. Instead of taking a step forward they take two steps back. In their final union, they both let down their sheilds to come together in what is, to me, a beautifully sweet story book ending.	2004-12-29

How dare he keep her under his thumb, protected like a hothouse flower! Abby had to teach Calhoun a lesson. With the fury of a South Texas twister, she devised a plan to prove her independence--and capture his attention.<br /><br />But Abby's scheme backfired. She wasn't like the diamond-studded sophisticates Calhoun chose as his companions. She was just a simple country girl who craved the love of a good, strong man. How could she make Cal see that his young charge had blossomed into a rose...and was now ripe for the picking?<br /><br />This book started the ongoing series \\"Long, Tall Texans\\". As always, Diana Palmer, does a splendid job developing her characters. There are moments of hilarity, in the beginning for example, when Abby tries to attend a male strip show and Calhoun catches her. As well as moments of sadness, when you can feel how burdened Abby is with her unrequited love of Calhoun. As you read the book you can see how both Abby and Calhoun mature. While Abby recognizes her feelings towards Calhoun from the very beginning, things aren't as simple for Calhoun himself. He realizes his feelings towards Abby have slowly change and aren't what a ward should feel towards his charge, but has yet to realize what they are. This is a beautiful story and will have you reading it over through the years.	2004-12-28
