It is the thrilling story from before man's emergence to the moment man chose the horse to be the companion of his infinite enterprise to the present. <br /> <br />This exquisite volume is the result of years of elaborate research by a brilliant international staff of experts headed by Luigi Gianoli, who himself has devoted a lifetime to the subject. <br /> <br />Here is the horse of millennia ago - man's favorite food on the Asian and European steppes; the Mongolian horse that carried the terrifying hordes against Egypt, China, and Rome; here are the invention of saddle, stirrups, shoes; the unique refinement of the horse for combat; the beginnings of Olympic chariot races, postal service, roads; and the origin of veterinary medicine. Here are the Middle Ages breeds bearing knights to love and holy war; equitation from its beginnings to its most sophisticated, and the origin of the Thoroughbred. <br /> <br />Material available in the past only through rare book collectors and private libraries has been tracked down and is included here. Complete sections are devoted to the beginnings of school equitation and the teachings of the great masters - Grisone, La Broue, Pluvinel, Newcastle, La Gueriniere, D'Aure, Baucher, L'Hotte - and to the developments of the great riding school, such as Versailles, Saumur, Vienna, and Hanover. Here are the first women in the saddle (Amazons); and Caprilli, the man who revolutionized equitation and whose system is still in use; modern riding and competition around the world today; flat racing, trotting, polo, the circus, and the rodeo; and much more. A chapter is included on breeds throughout the world, including anatomy, care, and treatment of the horse. <br /> <br />The nearly 800 remarkable illustrations carefully selected from sources all over the world - some taken expressly for this edition and never before published - convey the beauty and excitement of discovery and development of the horse through the ages. They include rare photographs, engravings, paintings, and other illustrations: Lascaux cave dwellings of wild horses, antique stirrups, Pisanello's studies of the horse's proportions, school airs (passage, piaffe, persada, capriole, etc.), Caprilli and other great masters in action, modern proponents (D'Inzeo brothers, William Steinkraus, and others) in both correct and incorrect performances, bridling a horse, holding the reins, as well as famous foundation horses, scenes of the Derby, the Royal Ascot, the great races at Saratoga, Aintree, Auteuil, and many more. <br /> <br />***My Review**** <br />This is an extremely extensive book on horse history, it would probably take weeks to fully read. A very good selection for a private university research library.	2005-10-11

Her dream was to one day have her own stables. But that dream was far away because her father had other things in mind for her - Honey had to decide which future was best for her. <br /> <br />***My Review*** <br />This is an interesting book about a girl who experiences both the lower classes in the horse show scene and the upper classes whose parties employ \\"the people who need work.\\" The book tracks Honey's journey from the horse to non-horse set of people with a nice \\"girl and her horse\\" plotline running though it.	2005-09-30

They want to give their guests an unforgettable weekend - all in the name of fun. The weekend starts out as a big success, but then mysterious things begin to happen, things that were not planned at all... Jenny is starting to feel scared. Is there someone out ot hurt her? <br />******* <br />My review: <br /> <br />I found this book to be a decent mystery. The book is set in the United Kingdom with a realistic if not quirky group of characters and their troublesome horses. During portions of the book the author appeared to wander and not have a set storyline. As an example, there was an old mystery with clues that never seemed to get fully developed. Additionally, I was not pleased with the dangerous ex-racehorse horse named Gold in the book whose owner's flagrant disregard for riding safety seemed to set a poor example for young riders.	2005-09-20

Meek has painted a collection of short stories based on an army horse that he knew during peace-time in Panama. Frog was a real Arabian horse that he knew between 1919 and 1920 when he was in command of the Empire's sub-post. Frog's legendary trick of jumping straight forward without any visible preparation gave him his name and appears during some of the horse's antics during the book. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for a person looking for something a little different than the modern horse stories. It combines jumping, adventure, sabotage, polo, exotic places, racing, and a hearty dose of old-fashioned humor. As it was written many decades ago it reads differently than modern books, more like a cross between Hemingway and Dorothy Lyons. <br /> <br />Collector's note: During some periods of its publishing this book was part of the set \\"Famous Horse Stories.\\"	2005-09-20

Seek then the one who comes Speechless from the Mountains: a Bard unSchooled and yet of this School. Seek and cherish the Fire Lily, the Fated One, which blooms the fairer in dark places and sleepeth long in darkenss; from such a root will blossom the White Flame anew, when it seems its seed is poisoned at the center.\\" -Pg. 170, \\"The Naming\\" <br /> <br />Alison Croggon has created a world where magic, song, and adventure blend and merge into an incredible story about a female bard in this \\"First Book of Pellinor.\\" \\"The Naming\\" is the first volume of four in the Pellinor series and is about the slavegirl Maerad who is discovered in the mountains by a bard named Cadvan (think of bards as magicians who can be gifted in craftsmanship, knowledge & lore, or healing similar to Tamora Pierce's \\"Circle of Magic\\" series but who also resemble Tolkien's elves). <br /> <br />Maerad and her teacher Cadvan journey through the lands of Annar in a desperate attempt to reunite her with her own kind but encounter many creatures of the Dark who would rather see her dead than fulfill an ancient prophecy that would return Annar to peace and prosperity. <br /> <br />Sometimes flowing as if a series of dreams, \\"The Naming\\" proudly marks itself as a great heroic tale that will certainly be placed with the likes of Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" Lucas' \\"Star Wars,\\" and Tamora Pierce's \\"Trickster\\" duet. I am certain that the only disappointment readers will encounter with this book will be in the realization that only one of the Pellinor books will be released in America in 2005.	2005-05-19

I did a muscle and joint force project for which I needed detailed muscle diagrams of the horse's hindquarters. When I needed the illustrations, of course, I could not find any that had the appropriate level of detail (not online, through videos, books, etc). For this reason when I recently saw this book it. I would strongly recommend that any other rider or person with a starting interest in horse healthcare do the same. This is an excellent addition to a equine reference library. <br /> <br />My version is spiral bound and had clear crisp black and white illustrations that can be xeroxed or colored in.	2005-05-11

Marguerite Henry certainly created a historical story about this horse! Overall a neat history of one of the most unusual recent dressage horses in US history but one that also seemed to be incomplete. I would have liked to read more about Misty's Twilight's dressage career but very little was mentioned in the story about it.	2005-02-23

Overall I found the recipes in the muffin book to be clear, concise, and easy to follow with good results. I also liked the fact that the recipes mainly called for common ingredients and were quick to make. <br /> <br />My two favorite muffins in the book were the cheese and the blueberry muffin recipes. Although the cheese muffin recipe was more like bread, it was hearty, warm, and absolutely perfect for a cold day. If you are looking for a well-rounded collection of muffin recipes I would recommend that you purchase this book.	2005-02-22

While watching the first season of \\"The Apprentice\\" on television I was impressed by the way that Donald Trump's right-hand businesswoman carried herself and the way that she presented her intelligence in a thoughtful and constructive way. <br /> <br />The book is a fast-read which is packed with good information. I personally liked her sections on \\"The Bad Boss,\\" (no, she was not referring to Donald Trump) how to work with a lousy boss and still maintain your credibility, and \\"The Good Company,\\" a look at identifying companies that will look out for you if you look out for them. I found Ms. Kepcher's advice throughout the book to be sound and extremely applicable to today's workplace. I heartily encourage people, especially women, to read and learn from this book.	2005-02-22

And I needed Ashley to help me find out who it was. <br /> <br />They already tried to steal my horse! Who knew what they would try next? <br />******* <br />My review: <br />I really enjoyed this book. It is a solid mystery where all clues point to the wrong person! The real horse-napping culprit is under their noses the entire time and the twins have a hard time discovering who it is. <br /> <br />Overall a good mystery written by an author who seems to know what really goes on at an English riding stable. The story was very believable with good characters. A nice choice for readers in grades three and up.	2005-02-22

While selecting my first trial recipes I noticed that if a person wanted to, he or she could preplan menus with this book. Many of the soups call for similar base ingredients and stocks so different soups could be created on consecutive days. <br /> <br />I've tried two recipes out of this book, one was excellent and the other was a disaster. I thought that the vegetable stock recipe is incredible and know that I will use it again; it is incredibly full of flavor and healthy. I cannot say the same about the split pea soup recipe. <br /> <br />The pea soup recipe sounded like a nice idea but it was not creamy enough to my taste. In fact, it wasn't creamy at all. The soup turned out gritty and chewy with a poor texture. I think that the recipe has some good flavor possibilities but needs more work to incorporate a smoother texture with more liquid that will allow the dried peas to adequately cook. <br /> <br />Maybe I just picked the worst recipe out of the book to try first but a 50/50 likelihood of recipe failure makes me hesitant to try another recipe.	2005-02-22

Overall I found the book to be slow-paced and lacking interest. Although it is a nice historical fiction of mid-twentieth-century Britain I did not find it to be particularly interesting and would not recommend it to anyone that I know. <br /> <br />The author's strongest ability was her ability to describe British class structure but her weakest was probably the pace of the plot line. Had there been more action and less depression among the characters I probably would have enjoyed it more.	2005-02-22

While reading this book I was enchanted by her tale of Fritz, a shetland (?) pony who was exiled from a city due to his stocky appearance. In the end this pony saves the day but not before a disaster happens on the road to the great city. <br /> <br />An excellent choice for a library, one that any child (although especially a horse-loving child) will want to read again and again. Ms. Brett's illustrations always set her books apart from her fellow authors and this book is no exception. She captures the life and beauty of every horse and pony in her book. <br /> <br />I believe that this is a second-grade reading level book although any age is certain to enjoy this story.	2005-02-21

I was disappointed to read the book and discover that the riding school was not the Spanish Riding School and the horse featured really could have been any other breed.

As Darci's double, Lucy could be the next victim. Lucy decides to find the culprit and prove herself as a rider, an actress, and a detective! <br /> <br />*********** <br />My review: <br /> <br />It seems like a lot of authors try to make their books exciting and take their characters to Southern California without actually doing their background research into the area. This author was different. The settings really make this book come alive because they are real places. <br /> <br />The character that Claire Birch creates in Lucy Hill is a smart, sweet, and fun-loving horsewoman with a passion for helping other people to solve mysteries. Overall the books are very realistic with a mature perspective on people and the horse world. I thought that this book was a nice addition to the series in its interesting storyline but only gave it a \\"four stars\\" rating because I found some of the plot lines to be a little too complicated to follow.	2004-12-17

Anderson's books are always full of beautiful pencil-sketched drawings that take the reader through story lines full of action, excitement, and the love of horses. <br /> <br />\\"The Horse of Hurricane Hill\\" is a nice book 107 pages long suitable for readers in grades three and up. Younger children will also like this book if they have someone to help them to read it. <br /> <br />Hurricane is a horse who lived in the wild with deer for the first few years of his live after escaping from a deadly stable fire. While in the wild he develops a love of jumping and learns to \\"jump like a deer\\" over obstacles. When winter and snowfall comes Hurricane becomes very hungry and walks into a small backyard stable where Stephen, a teenage boy whose childhood pony has just passed on, finds him.  <br /> <br />With the help of old-time horse trainer Mr. Marshall, his parents encouragement, and his own hard work, Stephen helps Hurricane to become an excellent cross-country jumper over the course of this memorable book. <br /> <br />Overall I believe that anyone who loves horses will love this book.

Being an experienced (but currently horseless) rider I loved this book! It's a wonderful celebration of everything that a horseless rider has gone through or dealt with. The author's stories of investigating a potential stable had me laughing from experience; the author seems to have found that not all barns with stunning white fencing are always worth their price. <br /> <br />I personally wouldn't really recommend this to a person who has ridden for less than five years because some of its advice will probably cause problems with other riders or stables. From my perspective the book was too quick to recommend readers to report to the ASPCA any stables with a horse that appeared to be thin. Some horses are \\"hard keepers\\" and will tend to look like that, they aren't always being neglected or abused. Additionally, the recommendations to \\"train\\" other people's horses for them while riding them will quite possibly not be appreciated by the owners if the horseless rider has not undergone extensive (and good) riding instruction themselves. My point is, unless you've been riding for a while, you wouldn't know any differently and might get yourself into some interpersonal relationship trouble. <br /> <br />Regardless, I loved this book and the wonderful way of writing that the author had and would not hesitate to read it again and celebrate memories of being a \\"horseless\\" rider.	2004-11-15

But they soon discover a much more sinister aspect to the Solaire program when an unexpected visitor welcomes them to their cabin: a poisonous black widow spider! <br /> <br />Every new activity poses a new risk to the staff and guests - beginning with sabotage and ending in kidnapping. The key to the case is Jacqueline Rozier, the world-famous model who runs Solaire. But what is she afraid of, and what shocking truth is hidden hidden in her past? Nancy must find the answers before the desert campaign of terror takes its final, fatal twist! <br /> <br />***** <br />My review: <br />Overall I have seen both better and worse Nancy Drew books. To me this book was just average. The characters were not all that original although I did like a \\"secondary\\" ending that occurred in the last few pages of the book (there were two separate resolutions in the same story line). A good addition to complete a Nancy Drew collection but don't expect anything spectacular.	2004-11-14

I have taught beginners for several years and can honestly tell you that even if they are doing everything right, their muscles will be so sore after a single hour that their riding will start to become sloppy.<br /><br />Assuming that a person has never ridden before and is expected to walk, trot, and canter in two days is asking too much and may be dangerous. Most new riders can't even \\"steer\\" their horse correctly, let alone give it proper cues and execute a proper trot without losing their balance and falling off.<br /><br />The reason that I gave this book three stars is because the content is good for a person looking for a quick refresher course in horse terminology. The pictures are wonderful and the book is nicely presented. Just don't expect to really learn to ride in a weekend.	2004-09-27

One of the ranch hands was involved in a treacherous scheme that could destroy the ranch and the horse Sis had come to love. <br /> <br />How could she let her uncle know that someone he trusted was deceiving him? <br /> <br />*********My review************ <br />This book is centered around a dapple gray show jumper called \\"Sea Gull\\" and Sis Reynolds, a girl who is hired by her Uncle Lee to be a ranch hand and English riding instructor for the summer. Lee had gotten the horse from a known horse abuser named Kramer who had made the gelding too high-spirited and afraid of jumping.

She's determined to become a championship rider, but when a series of rumors, strange coincidences, and accidents threaten the stable, Lucy faces a more immediate challenge: She must save Up and Down Farm! <br /> <br />Lucy's detective work begins to uncover some startling clues, and they all point to one person -- someone she thought was a friend. Will anyone believe her? <br /> <br />R.L. 4.7 <br />******* <br />My review: <br />Claire Birch is an awesome detective fiction author. Every one of her books that I have read has kept me guessing as to the criminal and motive until the very end. In this book Lucy is becomming a better rider and has started teaching the beginner's walk/trot classes at the stables while having the amazing opportunity to ride a horse named Silver Whistle. Her friend Jenny has since moved to California but there are some new characters including an eccentric news reporter named Henny that make up for that gap. <br /> <br />The book is a good choice for people wondering about why she moved to New York in the later books in the series as it fills in that gap but it's just a good choice in general. I personally think that older readers will enjoy this series more than the younger audience because of its elaborate plot line but any reader who likes horses will probably enjoy it.	2004-08-20

The main character, JoBeth, has lost her sister and is struggling to deal with the impact that her death from ALL has had on the family. Her father was always closer to JoBeth while her mother was closer to her sister Ashleigh and now that balance seems to have been broken. JoBeth tries to make up for her sister's death by being more like her and visiting her old horse Riono. <br /> <br />JoBeth doesn't know anything about horses or riding but is drawn to the solitude that the Hunt Club has to offer. While there she develops a relationship with the stableboy and overcomes her grief through horsemanship. <br /> <br />I personally did not think that the author needed to include all of the references to the stone pony from the museum because it seemed to detract from the main plot line. I did like the fact that JoBeth was able to grow stronger from her loss though so I give this book three out of five stars.	2004-08-06

Lucy is a smart and savvy English rider with a talent for solving mysteries around horses. This mystery is centered around a trio of English hunting and steeplechase scenes that Jenny's mother bought from a local antique dealer. Trouble seems to follow the buyers of the paintings around as a string of seemingly unrelated buglaries occur wherever they are taken. I really enjoyed this book because of its smart heroine and excellent mystery. Highly recommended!	2004-08-06

The reason why I bought this book was because of the Thai Chicken Springrolls. I always like buying them at CPK. Although they don't have the &quot;Mediteranean&quot; version in this cookbook I do enjoy the Thai ones very much due to their spicy sauce and fresh ingredients. One thing to know about the CPK cookbooks is that many of their recipes take a long time to prepare and several of them probably have ingredients that you won't normally have in your kitchen. The Thai rolls typically take me about three hours in total to make but like many of the dishes in this book, can be not fully assembled and stored in the refrigerator until it is time to do a final heating and serve. Once you serve them any problems that you had will be over though and you'll receive tons of compliments on your food. <br />  <br /> The reason for a non-perfect score: I had difficulty finding portion sizes, nutritional information, and estimated number of servings per recipe. Additionally, the way that the text wraps around the pages can make it difficult to not skip steps by accident. My best recommendation for you if you buy this book is to read all recipes at least two times before you start to make sure that you understand the time required, steps, and have all of the ingredients.	2004-08-04

This book, contrary to its title, is more about power and how to keep it then love or sex. The book shows how famous rulers and leaders have made their place in history through their ability to communicate and influence people. Although it does cover some famous relationships, like Cleopatra and her lovers, it does so in a historical evaluation with application to modern day life. <br />  <br /> I much preferred this book to one of his others, &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; because it approached leadership from a much more subtle angle that often works better. At the end of reading this book you should have found out how to make your enemies love you and want to please you without them having the slightest clue as to why. Very highly recommended. Quite possibly one of the best books on authority and relationships ever written.	2004-08-04

The story is of the Grace family trying to find a new home for their horse Hope. Unlike Faith (the horse from the first book), Hope is very average looking if not a bit ugly. Due to her allergies Hope looks terrible and not many people are interested in buying her. <br /> <br />After thinking about donating Hope to the local PAWS animal sanctuary the Grace family is contacted by Jill, a woman from the local home for disabled children. Hope seems like the perfect horse for them due to her calm disposition and steady gait. Over the course of the book Josie learns more about how animals can help humans and finds the perfect home for Hope in the process. <br /> <br />I personally preferred this book to the first book in the series because the characters seemed more natural and focused more on helping each other. Overall an excellent series with good characters and sweet horses.	2004-08-04

I had originally bought this book as something to read to my campers at riding camp but it has become one of my favorite horse stories. Children in grades 2 and up can probably read the book by themselves and will love learning about horses along with the book's main character Toni. The story is very realistic in the way that it describes riding stables and how people first learn to ride horses. Toni gets better at riding by WORKING for it and learning all that she can. As a result, the book shows her achieving her goals and making some new friends in the process. In my opinion this book would make an excellent gift idea for a younger reader that loves horses.	2004-08-04

The author starts the narrative with his reasons behind publishing the story. The story then unfolds in a chronological fashion highlighting Princess Grace's life from her birth until untimely death. The lives of her husband and three children were also mentioned frequently and gave insight into the entire royal fmaily. Overall I found it to be interesting and well-thought-out with attention to detail. While listening to the tapes I learned more about the historical figure and gained a better understanding of the Monaco principality. <br /> <br />The narrator, a Hollywood actor, never stumbled over words and had an excellent speaking voice that was nice to listen to. The tapes flowed well into each other and were well timed so that you didn't have to keep fast-forwarding to make up for bad editing on the publisers part. <br /> <br />Overall a good recommendation for anyone who is interested in learning more about Princess Grace of Monaco.	2004-08-04

The main character, Josie Grace, doesn't quite understand why her parents cannot relocate their riding stables but is eventually resigned to the fact that they need to find new homes for their three school horses Faith, Hope, and Charity. <br /> <br />Parting with Faith is difficult for Josie because she learned to ride on the horse. Now in her twenties (very old age for a horse) Faith needs a person who will care for her and not constantly want to gallop around. I pesonally think that the book was a little unrealistic because normally people list all of their stock at the same time is they need to sell it, but enjoyed the story very much. A good choice for anyone who is in the process of needing to sell their horses or has gone through this situation. Suitable for grades four and up.	2004-08-03

I had previously read \\"Collision Course\\" and \\"High Stakes\\" but this particular book really blows both of them away. The book is about a female English rider who solves mysteries; sort of like Linda Craig (by Ann Sheldon) but not Western. Along the way in her summer adventure Lucy needs to figure out inter-family politics, encourage a boy who doesn't like to ride to actually try, and try and prevent several different murder attempts. The part that I liked the most about this book was the fact that it kept me guessing who the attempted murderer was until the very end. Not a lot of books seem to have that ability while still being interesting. Overall a must-read for any horse-crazy person who also likes mysteries.	2004-07-14

WIll Pam be brave enough to rescue Lisa?<BR>**********<BR>My review:<BR>Overlal the Pony Camp series is a good one for any third through sixth grade reader attending a summer horsemanship camp. The back of the book seems to need more help. Jessie is actually mad at Pam because her mother invited Sally Keller (Lisa's friend) to stay with them while her parents are away. In the end Lisa does need help on trail but Pam is not the one who provides it. In addition, Dandy is not wild but is instead a well-trained show horse that goes faster than a walk.<br />Overall a very good read although not quite as good as the first one.

Stevie and her brothers came up with this crazy idea that her visiting grandma was a very delicate and frail person who couldn't be around too much stress or excitement. For that reason they all swear to be on their best behavior while the grandmother is visiting for two weeks. It was very funny to me to picture all of them being polite to each other and pretending to show interest in each other's sports. Along the way Stevie even convinces Max to do half of a lesson at a walk just so that the grandma won't get too excited!<br />The other plot line with Brittney and Magoo was not as entertaining to me because I thought that the entire idea of making her a Saddle Club member was pretty clueless on the parts of Stevie, Carole, and Lisa. I still give it five stars for its humor though.	2004-07-14

In the introduction there is a detailed &quot;possible problem&quot; list that contains common mistakes, what they look like, and how to avoid making them.<br />Each recipe was very simple to understand and read, having numerous success tips (every recipe was tested before being included in the book)and nutritional information.<br />Some of the recipes that I tried were: Mediterranean Herbed Bread, Sally Lunn, Sweet Orange Bread with Orange Glaze, Two-Cheese Pizza, and several kings of Dinner Rolls.<br />Overall probably the best bread machine currently on the market due to its attention to detail and quantity of recipes that really work.	2004-06-28

Both are very similar stories about Carole being jealous of another girl but this one differs because it's now a female rider that is getting all of the attention.<br />Andrea Barry and her horse Country Doctor are the hottest new things at Pine Hollow, showing up in expensive gear and boxes of championship ribbons along with a huge amount of knowledge (much to Carole's annoyance). What Carole and the other Saddle Club members do not know is that something isn't quite right in the Barry household and that images aren't always all that they appear to be.<br />Becuase of the plot and situations in this book, it is now my favorite book in the Saddle Club series. I think that in the current time of high unemployment this book really stands out. My one main problem with the book was that Bryant didn't make Andrea the fourth member of the Saddle Club riding at Pine Hollow. She's an amazing character that I would have liked to see in other books; if you read this book I'm sure that you'll see why.	2004-06-28

When I first got this book as a gift I wondered to myself &quot;how good can some collection of random people's recipes be?&quot; After trying a few of the recipes I discovered that the answer was &quot;VERY good.&quot; Now I just need to find Volume I.<br />This is an incredibly diversified mix of American cooking recipes in easy-to-read sections and bright and beautiful color photographs. The sections include: poutry, meats, fish &amp; seafood, soups &amp; stews, pasta rice &amp; legumes, salads &amp; dressings, vegetables, breads muffins &amp; sandwiches, cakes &amp; cookies, desserts, and appetizers beverages &amp; snacks.<br />I have never had a bad experience with any of the recipes in this book. For that reason it has earned its place with my other two all-time favorite cookbooks &quot;Betty Crocker Cooking Basics&quot; and &quot;Farmhand's Favorite Pies&quot; as an &quot;ACK! Company's Coming!&quot; type of cookbook... a book that I can run and grab off the shelf and with a little bit of effort turn out a flawless and decadent meal.<br />Just in case you were wondering, my favorite recipe in this book is that of &quot;Grasshopper Bars&quot; featured on page 366. It's a fudgy brownie base topped with a sinfully rich mint cream, and a cool chocolate topping. Try it; you'll LOVE IT!	2004-06-18

Overall I found them to be exciting and well-written \\"girl kicks butt\\" kind of stories. My favorites were \\"The Ginseng Potion\\" about Mulan, the Asian woman warrior and \\"Paistides\\" about a woman who takes her dead brother's place on Troy's battlefields. However, if you really want a reason to justify buying this book then buy it for the story \\"A Wolf Upon the Wind\\" by Jennifer Roberson.<br />This single story is so utterly chilling and yet bravely stirring that it makes the book pay for itself. The story is only six pages long but tells the tale of a young woman who was unmercilously raped, beaten, and killed by an enemy soldier on a Norse battlefield. Needless to say, she returns as a Valkyrie and lets it be known to the soldier that not all men go to Odin's great hall.<br />Overall good for a person looking for a collection of historical and myth-based stories with strong heroines.	2004-06-18

I have found this book to be very helpful in teaching me about cooking pasta and all of the wonderful sauces that can go with it.<br />The first portion of the book is excellent because it explains how to choose pasta in terms of ingredients and size/shape for a good pairing to the selected sauce. It also goes into techniques like tossing and using the right amount of cooking time. The recipes were clearly written and accompanied by many full-color photographs of what the dishes looked like when done.<br />Overall I have had a lot of good results with the pesto, tomato, and meat recipes. My cream sauces have not turned out as well though which is why I gave this book a four instead of a five. Regardless, it IS excellent and I believe a sound investment if you are looking to add a solid pasta book to your cookbook collection.	2004-06-18

This, however, is definitely one of them. I had often been recommended books by the various different authors in it but had never wanted to buy their individual books with the possibility that I might not like their styles. This compilation of short stories has really given me a great respect for all of the different writers as it showcases their incredible abilities to keep an audience attentive. No matter how unusual or fanciful each story seemed to me, I was delighted and thrilled to keep reading in order to find out \\"what happens next?\\"<br />What I found in Firebirds was an amazing collection of stories, some very fantasy driven while others were more inclined to historical fiction. There was a fun little story by Sherwood Smith that follows the daughter of her Crown Duel characters, a different story about a female sharpshooter who stops a town from being brainwashed by a politician, a story that is unfortunately chilling about the status of unemployment levels, a tale of a young lady's journey to meet her parents in Africa, and a very funny Wicked Witch of the West meets Sleeping Beauty and small town America tale of an abandoned baby who turns out to be a princess (if you read it you will understand... it's a very different but great story).<br />I highly recommend the book to people who normally like authors like Tamora Pierce, Robin McKinley or Lloyd Alexander.	2004-06-18

The book has a lot of action but seems to lack the developed plot of a typical Nancy Drew (female detective) book. The thing that I liked about this book was that it did not claim that Heather Reed, the blonde girl detective, was spectacular.<br />Overall the book also was a little hard to follow and had to spell out who was the \\"bad person\\" and motives in the last chapter because there were too many different possible paths along the way.<br />An average girl detective book that would be perfect for a third or fourth grade reader. While I did read through this entire book I cannot picture myself reading another in the series because it lacked a certain fluidity that I look for in a good mystery book.	2004-06-06

Overall I think that I enjoyed the \\"Water Horse\\" story the most. It was about a young girl named Tamia who is apprenticed to a guardian who protects the land from the ocean. She is surrounded by different kinds of horses during her life that impact her in different ways. Her childhood pony was her first friend, the Water Horse is a destructive monster that is flooding the land and killing people, and the mare and foal at the end save her and her people.<br />I liked the strong female heroines in her stories and am thankful that she is back to her rolicking and not trudging way of telling a story. Overall a good book for a Robin McKInley fan; I can't wait to see the other books in the series when they come out!	2004-06-05

It's a  story about a group of children in Britain (I believe) that all have their horses at the slightly run-down yet cozy Sandy Lane Stables. The story really focuses on one rider in particular (Tom) and his borrowed horse \\"Chancy.\\" The horse has almost been ruined by a bad rider and is now quite dangerous and unpredictable but Tom makes up his mind to try and re-train the horse. Over the course of the book Tom secretly works with the horse, risks being barred from the stable, and then saves the horse from a watery death in the ocean.<br />A light and happy ending and a fast read. Not particularly Joanna Campbell quality but not too bad either; just a  bit predictable.	2004-06-05

Boys tend to pick on them becuase they happen to like a specific hobby. In this book the real problems arise when May punches Will, a boy who has been teasing Jasmine about her like of horses. Jasmine gets upset because she wanted to deal with the problem her own way: by ignoring the boy until he lost interest in harassing her.<br />The story is a bit stilting, like the author was a little unsure of how to adjust her style to better suit a younger audience than the \\"Saddle Club\\" readers. Overall an OK book good for 3rd graders and up but I can definitely say that this series gets much better as the books go on so keep reading!	2004-05-28

The books in this series seem to be too simplified in their language and concepts, like the author is constantly talking down to the reader.    Overall a cute story but I had issues with the way that it was presented. The relation between Shadow (the cat) and Acorn (the pony) was a wonderful children's story but the way that the author writes just annoys me.    I recommend Bonnie Bryant's \\"Pony Tails\\" series over this \\"Pony Pals\\" series. Bryant does a better job of illustrating a story with words.	2004-05-28

Max, Pine Hollow's riding instructor and owner, holds trials for a team of six Pony Club riders to give a demonstration in a specail fundraiser show to beneifit the local animal rescue. When Corey is chosen to be on the team and Jasmine is not (May didn't try out) it puts the two girls in a very uncomfortable situation.<br />Over the course of the book the three riders learn that it's OK for different people to be skilled at different things and when Stevie Lake is snowed in and unable to lead the Starlight Christmas Ride only one special Pony Tail member can save the day!<br />Good for third grade reading level and up; a much better series than its closest competitor \\"Pony Pals.\\"	2004-05-28

At many times Carol and Lisa almost seem to be \\"too good to be true.\\" This book made Carol seem a bit more normal.<br />When Carol's dad offers to let Marie Dana stay with them for two weeks while her mother is in Europe Carol initially is excited about the prospect because she has never had a sister. She has some large problems adjsuting to her house guest though: everything from the radio being turned on too late at night to her father spending time with the guest trying to make her feel welcome. In my opinion Carol's jealousy was very realistic and normal for any person. I really liked how the ending turned out with Carol and Marie understanding each other better though; it made a nice closure to the story.<br />Overall a good story that was grounded and realistic.	2004-05-23

After all, she's been riding since she was young. But this last spill was different. Susan only broke her wrist, but she knows it could have been a lot worse for her or the horse. And it was her own fault. Now, just thinking about riding terrifies her.<br />Then Evening Star comes to the horse farm where Susan lives. Star's elegant gait and graceful stride show he could become a champion jumper. But he was mistreated by his former owner, and as a result he trust no one in the stableexcept Susan. Susan knows that only she can make Star a winner, but she also knows that she isn't ready to ride again... <br />****************<BR>My review: A book like this really reminds me of how great an author and horse person Joanna Campbell really is. The people in the book were very believable, especially Susan and the too-perfect (but nasty) to be true Tara. For anyone that has ever had a bad fall or riding accident I would strongly recommend this book because it shows how important it is to &quot;get back on&quot; and keep trying. It also goes into the reality of the horse show world where not all riders are nice to their horses and many are more concerned with the price tag of their horse rather than the fact that it is an incredible animal.<br />Overall very well-written and believable.	2004-04-26

It might seem strange but the best characters in the book were actually guys, not the lead girl. I've read lots of horse books and unfortunately there don't seem to be enough good male riders in them; this book was different.<br />Jeff, Joelle's disabled little brother, really brought to heart what it means to really care about horses. He took care of the filly when Joelle was going through about a year of hating it to death. Another character, Devin, the bad guy gone good in the story showed that it is important to not take your actions out on the horse but to accept them yourself. Joelle's father runs the riding academy in the book and puts in several good quotes about what makes a good rider in terms of care and responsibility.<br />(...)<br />Overall a good read, readers grades 5.1 and up will enjoy (according to the book's back).	2004-04-23

The tale of Robin Hood just never seems to get old. I would disagree with the posted age suggestion and say ages 7-10. The book is very thin and a quick read without many difficult vocabulary words.<br />What I enjoyed about this book was its characters. Rowan herself was more adult than child in terms of the way that she thought but was an excellent heroine due to her selflessness and desire to help others. The character of Etty will definitely will some fans as she sheds her princess role and becomes an outlaw girl, one that is one of Rowan's best friends. The only character I was a little surprised at was Robin Hood himself as he seemed to be a little too ignorant and gutsy to have really survived half a day in Nottingham. Regadless, it was an excellent and fun character.<br />I would say that readers of this book would also like the books by Tamora Pierce and Robin McKinley when they are older due to the definite presence of strong female heroines.	2004-04-19

The main characters had more drama than a stage play. Melissa was constantly making racist remarks and complaining that nobody liked her because she was black. Sharon spent her life making everyone's life miserable because she had been in an accident and wasn't riding like she used to. Jenna spent so much time whining about the horse, Turbo, that she wasn't able to buy and mentally hating her mentally-disabled sister that it was enough to drive a person half crazy.<br />The only people that were nice were Katie and the assorted supporting characters. For that reason I think that this book was more frustration than it was worth. If you're looking for a happy Saddle-Club type of book then this is NOT the one for you. If you do want to try the series then please read #3: Winning instead.	2004-04-19

The book is good for an audience as young as elementary school although people well into their seventies will love it just as much. It focuses its attentions on the adventures of a group of young ambient mages that meet for the very first time and must learn how to deal with working with one another even when they have all, well, not gotten along with anyone.<br />Tamora Pierce is an excellent author whose work has an enormous following of people desiring a literary dream full of magic and tenacity even when life might not be going so well. Her characters are always well-rounded but yet very familiar as if the reader has known them all their life. A fantastic recommendation as a present for a boy or girl who likes to read (just don't expect to see them until they are done reading!)	2004-04-11

In the books she explores the adventures of Tris, Sandry, Briar, and Daja as they take on their first students.<br />\\"Cold Fire\\" is a masterpiece of Pierce's, setting itself leagues apart from her other books involving the mage quartet due to its intense descriptions of the mental states of people during a string of deliberately set fires. She vividly describes the thoughts of madmen and detectives alike and culminates the novel into an intense climax that leaves the reader on the edge of his or her seat.<br />An excellent read, one that is sure to leave you \\"chilled\\" but clamoring for more.	2004-04-11

The tailor/spinner in the story is never referred to by his real name, instead he is just \\"tailor.\\" When he was young he was in love with a farmer's daughter who was a spinster. In exchange for her hand in marriage the farmer demands a wedding gown made of gold. In making the gown by turning straw into gold on an old spinning wheel the young man cripples himself and becomes deformed. The young woman then scorns him and marries a miller.<br />Later, the woman has his child (they'd slept together before he became crippled) and dies in childbirth. The story then chronicles the daughter's journey to adulthood and queenship in parallel with the tormented life of the tailor.<br />Overall an extremely sad book that makes you really feel sorry for the tailor but one that is exquisitely written.	2004-02-21

I had heard of the stunt team before and recently saw them featured in the 2004 Rose Parade on their Appaloosa horses but never really knew anything about them. After reading this book (suitable for anyone 10 and up I would say due to reading level) I have a hearty respect for the stunt team and their dedication to the advancement of horsemanship.<br />Although this is not a how-to book about riding, I think that it is a good addition to a horse or cowboy-lovers library because of its matter-of-fact exploration into what it takes to trully be a champion in horsemanship. Additionally, the story flows well and is very well illustrated with photos from Riata's heritage.	2004-02-20

It was interesting reading about the main character's recovery (over her fear) after breaking her leg. \\"All for a horse\\" has extensiove photographs taken in the early 1980s as illustrations that seem to date the book more than its plot.

However, for the advanced cook I think that this would be a very nice gift. You can count on William's Sonoma to not only create a beautiful meal but also one to make one that is delightful to the taste.<br />Recently I have been expanding my knowledge of cooking fowl and the book had an excellent recipe for Cornish Game Hens that would please anyone at a nice dinner party. Although the book is broken into seasons and many of the dishes are definitely more for a hearty winter than a hot summer, you do not necessarily need to be limited to cooking the recipes at those seasons. I would caution the cook to have a good grocery resource however as some of their ingredients are a bit difficult to find; hence the four and not five stars.	2004-02-20

At the estate she encounters a new jumping pony named Danny. Her mother doesn't quite apporove of her daughter working around horses and to make matters worse, is planning to remarry to an \\"imitation cowboy.\\" Danny is a spunky little gray pony who has placed well in the past at competitions. The pony's new teenage owner, however, is not pleased with him and wants her father to buy her a new thoroughbred. <br />What I did not like about this book was the fact that that girl still jumped Danny after he had sustained a leg injury, thus re-triggering it and just happily smiled and said something to the order of \\"what a good pony, he jumped for me even though he was hurt!\\" I thought that it was very irresponsible of the author to write.	2004-02-16

I am a huge advocate for more books that have strong female heroines in them; this is one such book. The Countess, \\"Mel\\" as she is affectionately called, is a heroine in her early twenties or so who is trying to uphold a vow to her fatehr that she would fight for the protection of the local mystical \\"Hillfolk\\" and their rare trees. In her efforts to protect this vow the books (there are two books in this novel) take the reader through wars in both the battlefield and the royal court. Mel soon learns that courtiers are not all that they seem and to the readers' delight there are many plot twists and suspenseful moments sure to keep you reading.<br />Although I don't want to spoil the ending, there is a large amount of romance in this boook that leaves you feeling excited and cheering for the heroine. One good feature of this particular binding is that it features a small short story, \\"Vidanric's Birthday Surprise,\\" additionally included in the end, that is about the central characters and is evidently not found in other versions. I highly recommend reading it because it gives you a wonderful closing to a wonderful duo of books.	2004-01-27

The main character is not \\"perfect\\" and actually spends much of the book trying to find her place in society after she is cast out of her patriarchal home where she was verbally and physically abused for not being a meek and submissive woman.<br />PS: The horses (Companions as they are called) are awesome! If you like horses you'll absolutely adore them!	2004-01-16

First off the pizza dough itself takes two full days to do. That's when my first error started: I tried to double the dough recipe (BIG mistake). The resulting goo was more of a new kind of super glue than dough. Next, the next day, I tried to roll out the goo into a pizza shape as it insisted in trying to cling around my arms when I tried to throw it. Again, big mistake. It just stuck to the rolling pin so I tried to mold it with my hands. After achieving a lumpy dough round that seemed to move around as much as &quot;Flubber&quot; I followed the instructions on the BLT pizza. The toppings and everything were perfectly explained. <br />After I cooked the pizza I took it out and much to my surprise the pizza crust was about an inch deep; it seems that my average interpretation of pizza dough depth was WAY off for this recipe; for all of you out there trying the cookbook make the dough about 1/8&quot;-1/4&quot; deep.<br />Finally I enjoyed my BLT bread (pizza?), thank goodness it still tasted good! Tips for buyers: set aside a ton of time to do a recipe from this book and read all of the recipe before you start so that you don't forget to set aside an hour here or there. If you are a beginning cook then this might not be the best book for you but start with something easy like the &quot;Betty Crocker Cooking Basics Book&quot; and work up to it. Best of luck!	2003-10-09
US	49256646	R2ADEEVXTRPTRK	0743243676	46085905	Williams-Sonoma Collection: Ice Cream	Books	5	121	123	N	N	Perfect Ice Cream	I bought an electric ice cream maker by GE at the store and had nothing but disasterous experiences with the recipes that came with it. In an attempt to try to get some use out of my investment I bought this book. Unlike the standard ice cream books it has many fruit recipes . My favorite, the one for blueberry ice cream, is always a hit because it has such an intense flavor and vibrant color.<br />I also especially like the fact that the book includes a recipe for peppermint ice cream since that recipe has been hard for me to find.<br />Overall the recipes work very well, the pictures are beautiful, and the instructions are easy to read. There is quite a selection of recipes in terms of time too. Many of the quick recipes do not involve egg (they involve milk and half&amp;half instead) so they are faster than the others without the potential risk of tasting like scrambled egg if you do them wrong.	2003-09-03

It explains how Cherie's twins grow up in the human and elf worlds and how they meet up with each other when they are about 16. I liked how the elf/human relations were elaborated on but was disappointed in the ending; the book abruptly ended about two chapters after they had finally gotten to meet each other. It is almost as if the author was in the middle of a thought and then put &quot;The End.&quot;	2003-09-03
US	49256646	RWFBHKOFAYQ8J	0590312960	824629425	Horse Like Mr Ragman	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Not everyone can have a pretty horse	I recommend this book because of what the main character goes through. The main character, Elizabeth, is the stable groom at Nolly Stables where she works because she loves horses. Her parents are middle class and cannot afford to give her the expensive riding clothes and horses that she thinks that she needs (because she sees everyone else around her with them).<br />When her father gives her a beat-up small pinto horse Elizabeth is far from being grateful and sees it as an embarrasment rather than a horse that she should be happy to finally have. Over the course of the book her attitude changes and in the end she values the Ragman much more.<br />Growing up it is easy to dream of all of the things that a person does not have but this book puts it all in perspective. For this reason it might be a good book for a parent to give their child who is just getting started in riding and is facing the same problems as Elizabeth.	2003-09-03

Overall it was very predicatable but a warm and fun read. The Saddle Club is extremely short on money so they all think that they will be unable to attend an important horse show in the Carolinas. However in the end they all help each other out during Christmas.<br />I think that anyone wanting a successful completion to the series will like this book as it really shows the friendship that all of the books had been centered on.	2003-08-17

If you haven't read any of the &quot;Shadow&quot; series then read this first. If you have then still read this. The book goes into the character of Cherie, the elf that always seems to help Shadow and is said to be the oldest of the Wilding clan. The book takes place in the beginning of elf-human contact and explains how the tradition of the high lord &amp; high lady elf/human relationship started. Overall very well written due to its 3D characters and fascinating story. The beginning is a bit slow but it rapidly picks up its pace.	2003-07-13

The apple pie was absolutely incredible as were the tarts but the tart dough caught my oven on fire the first time (the recipe called for far too much butter which leaked out everywhere). Overall a good book. For beginners I would also recommend &quot;The Farmhand's Favorite Pies&quot; by Mr. David Butler since its recipes have never turned out bad.	2003-07-13

The procedures are easy-to-follow and the results never fail. I had trouble making meringue before I bought this but it taught me exactly how to make it work every single time (even on cloudy days).<br />The pie crust recipes are really \\"never-fail\\" since they are easy to work with and don't stick to everything unlike most other recipes. The fillings themselves are well thought out and tasty while not needing many expensive or out-of-the ordinary ingredients.<br />Although some pies (especially the meringue ones) take time to make you will reap the results 10,000 fold. Once I took a pie to share with my friends and now they ask for them every time I see them!	2003-07-13

This book actually teaches you how to use them to make everything from the simplest to most elegant dishes in an easy-to-follow fashion. I actually consider this to be one of my favorites in the collection because it does not require as many specialty ingredients as the other books.	2003-07-13

I've used it cooking about twenty times for large groups of people.<br />This is not to say that the rest of the book is not completely worthwhile... it is! The reason why I gave it 4/5 stars was because I was not satisfied with the amount of beef recipes in the book, I would have liked to see some more recipes for tri-tip. I liked the fact that the author spent so much time on seriously considering the layout of the pages, they are all easy-to-read and very concise with tons of color photos. There are also sections devotes to sauces, techniques, equipment, and even recommended desserts.<br />Overall a must-have for fraternities, summer party-throwers, and BBQers everywhere.	2003-07-13

It also came with an interactive CD-rom that had chapter reviews, activities, animations, and interactive tests on it which was a tremendous bonus while studying.<br />Each chapter seemed to relate the human world to other animals and plants whice was a good thing because it clearly showed how everything was related in the world.	2003-05-22

It has much simpler all-American meals in it than this one. You will probably find this book to be the most useful if you are putting on a party because it breaks down complete menus, prep-time timelines (ex: 2 days before the party do ____), entertaining tips, and decorating tips. It also has a fantastic section on estimating the food requirements of large groups of people.<br />I do think that this is a good guide for any kitchen (especially beginning cooks) because it has one of the most easy-to-read formats that I have found; it is full of lovely pictures, techniques, and nutritional info. The best plus, however, was probably the fact that you don't need to have 50 million ingredients to do the recipes.	2003-05-22
US	49256646	R1GSLAMKAGJCIO	0130334936	157767675	Learning SolidWorks	Books	3	7	7	N	Y	Some Technical Problems	Well starting out, I was using Solidworks from 2003 and this one was really for 2002. However, the programs are very similar and the Help inside of the program itself can help you to realize when there are program differences present. I must admit that I did learn a lot from this book (most of the basic features and it boosted my confidence level) but I was only able to get past half of it in total because the program kept having errors even when I was following the directions. Also, there were some steps (like in the blade chapter p.44 where Geometry-pattern actually did need to be checked) and sometimes the author wasn't very clear (like which specific origin to choose when).<br />The pictures and window illustrations were pretty straight-forward as was the text and I really liked the construction of the pizza cutter because it dealt with curves, revolutions, planes and assembly drawings. It was rewarding to see the object come together while following the manual.<br />Overall, if you are interested in a quick refresher guide to the program this would probably be a good choice. If you are a complete beginner then the book will help but be prepared for frustration.	2003-05-22

It is one of those books that has 3D characters who you really want to succeed. I would recommend this book to young women who have or dream of owning their own horse regardless of the training and work that must go into owning one.<br />The ancient time period was a nice bonus because it made the story different fromt the typical \\"girl finds run-down horse at local auction\\" story that I'm sure we've all seen.	2003-05-22

Although the author takes too long to get to most of her points, it is a very insightful book and has ideas about power tips to use in the jobplace such as how to act in meetings, where to sit to attract attention, and dealing with staff. I would recommend it to a reader interested in advancing her place in business with the warning that a lot of &quot;skim reading&quot; is needed.	2002-02-22

You will definitely not regret it. This book breaks riding down into beginning, intermediate, and advanced; all in different bulleted sections on the same page. That way you can read any level description and actually see where it's going. I especially like the hand-drawn pictures on every page which are clear and concise. Not only does he tell you what to do, but the pictures show you how to do it: exact positions of hands and legs are drawn on every page! The entire book is presented in a logical manner and is very easy to follow. The author knows exactly what he's talking about and is sure to help you too!	2001-09-26

The author made her entire Honeymoon (not really) trip to Iran colorful and distinct. The people that she met were distinct and full of hospitality. This book gives the reader a much lighter version of Iran than anything else that I have read. I especially liked the way that she simplified many traditions and customs, making the text both informative and easy to read.	2001-09-26

For any woman who has had to or currently deals with a &quot;Peter Pan&quot; this book can really help. I was shocked to learn that the problems are actually prevalent in America. I honestly did find it useful in understanding the behavior of a friend of mine; I had fallen into the trap of believing that everything was my fault.  Dr. Kiley's book helped a lot in understanding that part of &quot;Peter's&quot; immaturity can reveal itself in emotional abuse by piling blame on everyone else around him; especially the women in his life. Unfortunately, many of us would never want to believe &quot;bad&quot; aspects of the man because his normal &quot;show&quot; attitude is so amazing.<br />If you think that your loved one suffers from this, please read it. If nothing else it can help ease some of your frustration and make you realize that you are definitely NOT alone in dealing with these men and their problems. Hopefully it can give you some idea of where to start in helping both yourself and that man.	2001-09-26

Dr. Kiley attempted to answer these questions with this book. Although mostly a series of case studies it did have some good points. Chapters included potential victims, falling in the Wendy trap, denial and effects, hitting bottom, and how to resolve the Wendy Dilemma by becomming a Tinkerbell. I strongly recommend reading this book after the &quot;Peter Pan Syndrome&quot; or you will be confused with some of his references.<br />The last chapter on transitioning to a Tinkerbell was the most enlightening for me; it was one thing that the first book did not cover in enough detail.	2001-09-26

Xenophon wrote this work from the his viewpoint of a cavalry commander several thousand years ago. Even though the work is literally dated his knowledge has never ceased to be of interest to modern riders. Perhaps the first novel ever written on horsemanship it includes training troops, choosing horses, and putting on army displays. Although not the best choice for a person who desires a book to teach them to ride, this book will be a delight for any horseperson desiring to learn about ancient cavalry practices and the origins of the horse in military settings.	2001-09-26

Glenda Riley is concise and simple in her explanations; she does not &quot;wander&quot; in explaining and includes an extensive index which makes this an invaluable scholastic reference.

Peg Kerr is simply amazing at developing convincing and relatable characters. All of the characters are diverse but enthralling from the quirky wizard Arikan to the noble Lady Rhuddlan. My favorite aspect of this book is that it keeps you enchanted in every chapter. The scenes change enough to make the novel interesting while being carefully crafted to your imagination. The plot is also multi-faceted: it's a mystery, suspense, fantasy, adventure, humor, and love story all in one! I highly recommend this book to any reader looking for something memorable.	2001-04-28

The Pork Tenderloin is absolutely delectable and the salads are meals in themselves. This book is spiral-bound so it lays flat while you are working; you don't need to fight with pages that want to turn. I really like how every recipe has a full-color picture of what you are making as well as an easy-to-read listing of ingredients in the same spot on every page. The book was published by a distinguished text-book manufacturer (McMillan I think) and is set up identically to a teacher's guide for school. Basically, it's easy to read, simple to follow, and explains EVERYTHING with step-by step pictures in a specially designed techniques section. Although an experienced chef will find this to be an excellent selection of dishes even a beginner can use this book to cook like a pro!	2001-04-28

The author is somewhat confusing as she consistently identifies several lies about Calamity Jane before telling the facts. Some of the time I couldn't figure out if what she was currently discussing was fact or fiction. However, after sorting through her analysis I was able to put together an exceptional list of facts that lead to an A on the paper.

The author, Anne Logston, creates in Periann a woman that we can all relate to. She worries about her family, is concerned with the way that she is perceived, and wants to do what is &quot;just,&quot; even if it is not socially accepted. Atheris, her rescuee/love interest, is convincing and sets a contrast to her character. The author has created a complex civilization in this novel and has done an incredible job with imagery. I would recommend this book to high-school and above ages due to the presence of some graphic scenes. Needless to say, they are few and it is an excellent book.	2001-04-28

However, the characters are more realistic and complex. Lionheart and Jeweltounge (the sisters) were interesting characters although I really liked what she did with the beast the best.

I like the way that it addresses &quot;priority points&quot; to remember in each exercise. This book is an excellent supplement to riding instruction because it can help you to review a lesson before or after you have taken it; a sort of &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; to the dressage world. The author is incredibly easy to follow and has a logical progression of thought. An excellent intermediate - not beginner - book.	2001-04-28

Any future authors can only hope to mimic Robin McKinley's superb character developments and vivid images of scenes. The heroine, Beauty, is a lady that women can only hope to be like. She is a fantastic role-model for girls because she is relateable to everyone. Her virtues of honesty and compassion do not make her &quot;above&quot; her peers, but rather fill-out a complex person with her own sets of problems.<br />The Beast is multi-faceted. He changes from tyrant to prince so vividly that the reader feels like they are right in the book with the characters. <br />This book will make an exceptional gift and is sure to be a treasured member of any well-rounded library.	2000-10-08

It is about fencing (swordfighting) and the search for an old missing blade that has a will written on it. In order to gather clues to find the blade, the Hardy Boys go on-set at a movie filming to help with stunts. In the process they actually partially team up with their father who is working on a separate but closely related case (which makes this book a bit different from others in its series). Although the plot was rather predictable (gosh, could it possibly be that Frank and Joe save the day?!?), the book was still a fun read and will be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys fencing.	2000-10-08

If more riders and instructors read it then maybe there wouldn't be so many problems in the horse world. I really liked the way that the book dealt with the unsaid rules of the riding academy: how an instructor-rider relationship works, how to work with grooms, and what the necessary qualities of a school horse are. It is also a relief to find an author that reminds people that learning to ride right does take time! <br />One of my faorite quotes is on pg. 137. It reads &quot;With riding, much more important than recognizing the fault is to find the cause. The teacher should beware of demanding that the exercise be performed strictly according to the clasical rules right from the beginning.&quot; If nothing else, the reader will learn WHY certain lessons should be in a specific order and how to know when to do them.<br />This book is probably one of the best investments an equestrian can buy. Written by a man decades ahead of his time, it will make a positive impact on the way you work in the horseworld.Enjoy!	2000-10-08

The characters of Kel and her friendsare well thought-out and totally believable.

Chapters include anatomy, balance, the gaits, aids, transitions, salf-carriage, forces of energy, and  collection/extension. Ms. Swift uses imagery to illustrate her points: like  pretending to have a tree for your back in order to &quot;grow&quot; and  stetch out the spinal cord. I found the frequent reminders about muscle  tension and breathing to also be very beneficial. Working with a flighty  mare, I sometimes forgot about the concept of breathing. By doing some of  the breathing exercises in this book I learned how to &quot;breath&quot; my  way through problems and am seeing remarkable success with calming my horse  around pool heaters, chainsaws, and other scary things. I also discovered  that this book is a great companion to Col. Alois Podhajsky's &quot;The  Complete Training of Horse and Rider.&quot; Ms. Swift works wonders for the  rider and the colonel trains the horse. When read together the results are  truly dynamic. Excellent book Ms. Swift! :)	2000-07-07
US	49256646	R2DZZNDMDUYVHH	0879802359	307130800	Complete Training of Horse and Rider	Books	5	95	97	N	N	The Ultimate Horse Book	In my opinion this is one of the finest horsemanship novels ever written. Alois Podhajsky, dressage icon and former head of the Spanish Riding School, has created an exemplary literary piece that few horse books ever  come close to. The book is divided into six chapters; each chapter has  smaller subsections for easy referencing. Although younger readers may find  this book to be &quot;long&quot; or &quot;boring&quot; due to its eloquent  vocabulary, any serious horseman (or woman) will find this to be an  exceptional novel. For people with little time I would recommend reading  small sections at a time. The author explains so much that the reader  should reflect on what he or she is learning, not just try to  &quot;cram&quot; through it. The explanations in this book resulted in a  marked improvement in my own skills, and I often refer other riders back to  it whenever they are having trouble. Podhajsky makes even the most complex  dressage manuvers easy to comprehend. I especially liked the way that he  formed two different chapters on &quot;the training of the horse&quot; and  &quot;the training of the rider.&quot; By breaking the two concepts apart,  a rider is able to first read of what the horse should be doing and then  what he or she should be doing at the same time. Other chapters are about  the principles of riding, definitions and key concepts, saddles and  bridles, and the Spanish Riding School. The photographs and drawings in the  novel are logical and illustrate the points wonderfully. Wise is the rider  (even Western riders will benefit from the control and balance exercises)  that buys this book; it is the perfect companion to horsemanship lessons.	2000-07-07

Although Nancy, Bess, and George aren't great horseback riders, the horse scenes are fun and adventurous, and the mystery is fast-paced. The supporting  characters are also well-rounded. There was even a surprise ending!	2000-06-30

It is an incredible historical fiction about the development of farriership (blacksmithing) in the world. The characters and plot are well  thought out and balance the technical aspect of the book. Even a person  with no knowledge of horses would find this to be an interesting novel.       The hero is both relatable and human; he makes mistakes but learns from  his experiences working with the horses. Arthur, the future King Arthur and  a supporting character in this book, has never been characterized in such a  realistic way; the character seems to come alive in the pages of this book.	2000-06-30

This is the story of Hans, a young Austrian boy that wishes more than anything to work with the &quot;Dancing White Horses,&quot; the Lipizzaner stallions of Vienna. In the story he is accepted to the Spanish Riding  School, the finest riding school in the world, and then the work begins.  Teamed with his patient instructors, one two-legged and one four-legged,  Hans sets out to achieve his dream and prove to everyone that any goal is  possible with dedication. This is my all-time favorite horse story; the  characters are believeable, the illustrations are gorgeous, and the story  is timeless.	2000-06-30

It covers the basics of most equine topics, and is in an easy-to-read format. I unfortunately did not find this book useful. Anyone past the  &quot;intermediate&quot; stage may become board with it due to its lack of  advanced excercises and vice-solving. For more dedicated riders I would  recommend &quot;The Complete Training of Horse and Rider&quot; by Col.  Alois Podhajsky. Once again, this is a good book for beginners but not  intermediate or advanced riders.	2000-06-30
