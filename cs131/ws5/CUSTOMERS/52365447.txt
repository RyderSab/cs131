It has taken me an abnormally long time to finish this extraordinary book, something like four months, and I have yet to completely digest all that Ruppert has said.  This book demands much of the reader: it demands that they deal with facts and figures beyond that which one generally encounters and the writing demands a sense of unreality when absorbing information, the broadness of which is not seen on the evening news or the weekend newspaper.<br /><br />This book will cause many, if not most people, to slam the book closed, shout obsenities at the author and denigrate any fool like me who accepts the evidence as written of American goverment obstruction, falsehoods and criminality.  Yes, yes-I believe it all!  I believe that Ruppert has presented an airtight case for the mammoth dishonesty that the federal government has perpetrated on America and the world since coming to power at the turn of the mellenniuim.  The world has been lied to and continues to be lied to but the full picture of the transcendence of this lie is now slowly making itself apparent.<br /><br />In his last chapter, The Summation, Ruppert beautifully sets out the many points of his thesis: the reasons why the elites were/are so worried [Peak Oil], how they constructed their plan to bring the needed oil resources under their control and finnally he illuminates the complexity of actualy making this amazing plan work.  Ruppert presents, in the course of some 600 pages, a detailed prosecution case for-at least to this juror-a definite guilty verdict.<br /><br />This book saddens me more than it makes me mad; I feel bad that these people, at the pinnacle of power, have such a demeaning opinion of, not only the American citizens but also the rest of the world.  The world exists as a gigantic pie to be consumed only by the elites.  Maybe I should change from saddness to anger.	2005-10-04

I have just finished this fascinating little book and although I enjoyed it immensely, it still left me with many of my original questions unanswered.  I know, I know-it is extremely unthinking of me to fault a writer and their book for not writing the book that the reader would have written but still after a number of cruises there are many areas of the onboard cruising experience that are still pools of unknown knowledge that I cannot provide material to fill.  Joyce has covered many interesting topics, some of which had never even occurred to me and I am richer for the wonderful anecdotes that pepper her book.<br /><br />I would, however, have preferred her to supply some of the \\"nuts an' bolts\\"  of the cruising experience from an employees point of view such as: who rooms with who and who decides this important question, what do crew members do when not working and where do they do it, how are crew quarters laid out, is food supplied, what sort of amenities are onboard for the crew, etc. etc.?<br /><br />Joyce's book is a wonderful insight into that hidden world of the criuse employee and I would encourage her to write a folow up and tell her readers of the \\"hidden\\" world of contemporary international cruising.  Considering how popular this fom of holiday has become, I am sure the book would sell well.	2005-08-08

I finished Elder's wonderful and rewarding New Zealand travelogue this morning over coffee in Fremantle and I enjoyed the account of his journey from Stewart Island in the far south to Cape Reinga in the far north thoroughly.  This book is the best kind of travelogue because the writer presents a reasonable look into the country being visited-its foiables and its positives.  This is not to say that the description is tedious and overly factual, after completing the book the reader is left satisfied with as reasonable an account of his journey as is possible given the two month time frame allowed for its completion.<br /><br />I enjoyed Elder's observations about the nature of Australian life as opposed to Kiwi life: its origins, its developement and why, although geographically close, we are so different particularly when seen through the eyes of a visitor.  From my perspective here in Australia I found his observations valuable if perhaps overdrawn.<br /><br />I also found many of his thoughts about the huge differences between his native New York City and the life he found in New Zealand interesting.  New Zealand's distaste for tipping and litigation is matched only by our own, however Elder's negative comments have fallen on my deaf ears.  As a leftist I also found his conclusions on page 209 as to why New Zealand works so well also fitting our life in Australia: health is taken care of, as is education, old age and unemployment.  Politically speaking, if a country as small as New Zealand can accomplish these civilities with its few natural resources then the question must be asked why can't other richer countries.  Although coming from, as Elder points out, vastly different bckgrounds our two countries have adopted similar governmental parameters with similar positive results.<br /><br />Elder's anecdotes about all the pieces of Kiwi culture that he encountered are wonderful reading: people running homestays, fishing guides, airplane pilots, adventure operators and guides-in short, a reasonable look at Kiwi society.  We all realize that it is virtually impossible to encounter  the totallity of a society on a holiday but Elder presents us with as complete a picture as armchair travellers will find and for this I reccommend the book very highly.  You will have a most satisfying read.reasonable look at Kiwi society.

I just finished reading this illuminating and insiteful book and, although it trolls through waters fished by other writers, I still found the book an excellently written investigation into the myriad contradictions so apparent in the official investigation into the events of 9/11.  I was impressed with the mountain of media gathered by Maars from sources around the world demonstrating that there are questions being asked by people far removed from the immediacy of Washington's Beltway.  I find it unbelievable that any reasonably well read and well informed person could dismiss the factual material presented by Maars and other writers because the complete scenario is so believable.  There are people who hold strong beliefs that their vision of the future is the only \\"right\\" one and that any action that leads to that conclusion is inherently \\"good\\" for the masses that don't have the brains to understand the overriding concept in the first place.  As Maars relates in section 21, the American people, and many of my own Australian people, want to believe in the \\"good\\" so they will allow the erosion of long-held rights in order that this \\"good\\" will eventuate.<br /><br />There are many scary bits in this book and perhaps the scariest are in section 18.  It is bad enough to think that corporations play puppet master to the Empire but to think that other countries are so powerful that they can  pull the strings of the Leviathan makes for disturbing reading.<br /><br />I think Maars is right and it scares the hell out of me.	2005-07-01

I do not think the general reader will last more than a few chapters of this masterful book so be warned-\\"The Yellow Cross\\" is very dense and therefore not a quick read either in terms of time nor in terms of content.  Having used those disclaimers, any person looking for a \\"picture\\" of medieval existence will be richly rewarded with the massive amount of detail regarding individual life during this time.  Weis' wrings huge amounts of mundane detail about ordinary life as it was lived in the 12th and 13th centuries in Occitania-that region of medieval France in its southeast corner-Cathar country.<br /><br />Some people have objected to the avalanche of detail marshalled by Weis in this wonderful book; I, however, find this avalanche one of the book's major strengths.  I have read a reasonable amount about the Middle Ages but this book presents a more complete picture of ordinary life during this huge period than I have as yet seen.  Some of these illuminating details: the descriptions of villages and the organization of the domiciles in those villages; how people interacted with each other-both sexually and domestically; how people maintained death-defying activities as heretics, as well as many others throughout this dense book.<br /><br />I cannot praise \\"The Yellow Cross\\" highly enough but my less than perfect rating is simply a recognition of the difficulty some unwary readers might have if they attempt this book without being aware of the complexity with which they will be challenged.<br /><br />As an end note I would suggest to any reader with a modicum of interest in the Cathars to visit their last redoubt at Montsegur and walk through the village at its base.  That little walk prepared me for the description of the village of Montaillou around which \\"The Yellow Cross\\" takes place.  The Middle Ages cannot but envelope you and with the fortress watching your movements you will experience a bit of time travel-enjoy!	2005-06-17

Call me stupid, call me naive but I am continually surprised by the falseness and dishonesty of the United State's government in virtually all the reading explorations I undertake.  I do not start these explorations with an outcome in mind: true, I have my normal bag of philosophies and mind-sets that any person alive in this world carries with them.  But what has numbed my mind has been the extent of the duplicity that the US government has undertaken in that government's attempt to make the world safe for the further expansion and, at the least, protection of their economic system.  Hopsicker, in this wonderfully enlightening book, mentioms at least six other books that continue unmasking various aspects of this mammoth cover-up and I will have my future filled with further frustrations regarding a government that the world has accepted as upright and straight-dealing on the international stage.  How wrong we have been!<br /><br />\\"Barry and the Boys\\" is a chronicle of American governmental lying-to both the media and, worse, to the legislative branch of their own government all in the name of countering an evil, as they saw it, greater than the evil they were perpetrating on the American people.  I believe all that I read in the pages of this book; further, I believe that now that the genie has been released, as of the Bay of Pigs and the Kennedy assassination, there can be no going back and now that genie must be fed continuously so that it will not devour, not only America, but my world also.<br /><br />It is difficult to imagine a country that would allow the evil of drug addiction to enslave its own people all in the name of acquiring illicit money to fund programmes propping up wasted, rightest dictators whose only vision is staying in office and keeping the American drug pipeline clear and flowing.  Besides destroying these individual countries social cohesion, Hopsicker reports on the destruction of large sections of American society as a result of this drug pipeline.<br /><br />The only negatives about \\"Barry and the Boys\\" that I saw, were the final chapters dealing with individuals connected with Barry Seal's \\"business\\" and the myriad interconnections of the major players.  I had my hands full trying to keep so many people separated but this just shows the depth and the breadth of this entire \\"business.\\"s drug pipeline.   <br /> <br />The only negatives about \\"Barry and the Boys\\" that I saw, were the final chapters dealing with individuals connected with Barry Seal's \\"business\\" and the myriad interconnections of the major players.

I started the Provence trilogy by reading the last one first-no matter,I will probably read them again because they are so good and redolent [maybe too strong a word] of humanity.  I read books slowly and the predominant thought that I always dealt with at the time, regardless of how much of it had passed since last I picked up the book, was the extraordinary humanness of his writing.  The book oozes with deep, deep love for the people, their culture and the land that surrounds them-even the animals that accompany their passage through this life in the Luberon.  The second thought that always occupied my mind as I read Peter Mayle is one of total envy-how can a person be so observant and at the sme time express those observations so lovingly and so clearly.<br /><br />To someone who has not read the book, realize that it is a series of anecdotes about the people that become part of his life in Provence.  These people, perhaps naturally or perhaps through Mayle's superb writing, take on a larger than ordinary life.  He paints them with the utmost care and love but they emerge from his canvas as more interesting, more substantive and more full of life than most of us can manage-hence the title of this comment.<br /><br />A marvellous, readable book.	2005-04-19

Unfortunately I heard other people's impression of this book before and as I read it those impressions were a thick mask covering the sensitivity and pathos of Marina's story.  Yes-the book is hard going initially because she spends much time stiching together the impact of living under the shadow of, arguably, the greatest painter of the twentieth century; however, if the reader perseveres and follows her story to its uplifting and expansive conclusion, they will be rewarded.<br /><br />As Marina finally confesses in the last chapter of her memoir, beginning life or living part of your life under the canvas of a man named Pablo Picasso was terribly difficult.  On page 183 she catalogues the immediate Picasso family members who comitted suicide: three and possibly four if you count Dora Maar who starved to death rather than sell her Picasso paintings.  Marina writes on the same page, \\"I was meant to be one of the victims as well\\".<br /><br />I will never forget that Marina did what too many rich, well off people fail to do and that is to use her considerable [yet small by world standards] Picasso fortune to create a village in Viet Nam to house and care for orphan children-several of those children she adopted into her own family of two children.  Obviously she was looking to provide a childhood she felt had been denied her by living under the shadow of her famous grandfather.<br /><br />I left this book thinking better of humanity and I recommend Marina's memoir to any reader interested in the life of someone connected but unconnected to greatness.	2005-03-22

I just finished reading this tremendous book and I am a little shaken-Perkins has set out a vision of how the world works that is staggering, even for somebody like me who looks under the carpet of contemporary events.  I have made it my business over these past years to attempt to come to grips with the world we live in and most importantly to try to see how the world picture is put together-how does the world work; what makes it work; who is pulling the strings of this planet at the turn of the third millenniun.<br /><br />As opposed to previous commentators I take all that Perkins has written at face value.  I don't think he is a mad conspiricist; I don't think he is an embittered man who is raging because of missed promotions; I don't think his story is fiction and I don't think that he was low on the totem pole of power and really had no clear picture of all that was taking place.  All of these accusations against his book have been cited as reasons for discounting what Perkins writes and I believe those conclusions are ludicrous.<br /><br />I virtually used up a marker underlining passages from this powerful book.  Perkins admits early on page 15 that his job was to convince developing countries that they could afford the massive debt burden needed to buy the infrastructure for their economic expansion.  I could never understand why developing countries put themselves into such massive debt-debt so large that they could never pay it off.  Countries are not stupid-they would not do something so heinious to their people's future.  Now I see why it happened-Economic Hit Men [EHM] like Perkins cooked the books.  They were trusted to provide accurate economic forcasts for those countrie's future expansion and the Empire then ensnared them because of this false data.  These countries will never pay off this monstrous debt.  As perkins points out-they are not supposed to pay it off because that indebtedness is what binds them to the Empire.<br /><br />Perkins writes about those leaders who have recognised the ploy and refused to play the Empire's game: Arbenez in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran, Allende in Chile and Torrijos in Panama.  As Perkins writes, if the EHM can't pursuade you, then the Jackels move in to eliminate you and if that fails then invasion happens.  The pattern is all too obvious in our contemporary world.<br /><br />If you read no other book for the remainder of your life, read this one.  Every person alive deserves to know what is happening.have recognised the ploy and refused to play the Empire's game: Arbenez in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran, Allende in Chile and Torrijos in Panama.

Taylor writes clearly and covers the many aspects of the wartime bombing of Dresden well.  Some commentators have thought that his vision was too expansive, that his chapters in Part One were unnecessary and that the scope of Dresden was too encompassing.  To my mind, however, I found his early chapters on Dresden's history and the city's military significance during WWII an integral part of the story of Dresden and the role it plays in modern 20th century history.<br /><br />In Part Two from page 251 through page 332 the reader is given as full an account as possible of what happens on the ground when the bombing crews \\"get it right\\".  I have not read any other books about the Allied air offensive against the Axis powers during WWII and after reading this book there is little likelihood that I will-one is enough and Dresden is that one.<br /><br />Taylor's final chapters in Part Three cover the propaganda made by, particularly, Goebbels after the full extent of the city's destruction became known.  Taylor also takes time to discuss the mistakes, his words, made by the Allied Air Command in reporting the raid and it's significance to the war effort.  Taylor believes it was at this point where the allies made bad mistakes- mistakes that have heavily contributed to the far-right use of this raid on Dresden for it's own propaganda purposes in our contemporary world.<br /><br />If you have any interest in the Second World War and beyond that, in that war's impact on our world 66 years after, then I would urge you to read this wonderful history.	2005-02-15

I admit to knowing nothing of the substance of this book-I bought it as a combination deal offered by Amazon-I really wanted to read Perkin's other book about his years as an economic hitman for American capitalists.  Further, I admit to being a complete skeptic in matters beyond the mundane.  Having admitted to those qualifiers, I found the book well written [if not a little jumpily] and again, if not persuasively, at least an enjoyable reading journey.<br /><br />I must chide Perkins for keeping his readers strung along until page 157-eight pages from the end-when, after writing about shamans and the extraordinary things that we in the developed world can learn from the \\"other\\", he all of a sudden drops Jesus Christ into this magical, pagan story.  Sorry but I lost the whole book right there after spending so much time wondering what sort of book I was dealing with.  I admit to thinking at times while reading Shape Shifting that I could have been attending a faith-healing service conducted by a Bible thumping preacher because the similarities of the \\"healings\\" seemed to be close.<br /><br />As a skeptic I can't focus on all that he talked about although he presented the information well and I journeyed over ground that was new to me.  I was ready to go along with him to an extent until that notorius page 157 and all that he had written collapsed like the proverbial house of cards.<br /><br />Approach this one with caution.	2005-01-30

I have been watching the matching BBC video of this wonderful book and finally decided to purchase the original cookbook to accompany the series.  I am pleased that I did so because Carluccio's book contains more recipes than the accompaning video and the anecdotes that he uses to introduce a particular recipe add an enriching extra fullness to the food.<br /><br />For instance, his desciption of the contents of a Sicilian shepherd's lunch and his explanation of why Sardinian cuisine is based on meat rather than fish even though Sardinia is an island [centuries of seaborne attack forced the people into the interior of the island for protection] make \\"Southern Italian Feast\\" a book to be read rather than simply referred to as a normal cookbook.<br /><br />The extent of the recipe collection is well matched to the Mediterannean climate here in southwestern Australia therefore the food fits perfectly into our larder and the resulting lifestyle is matched to that of southern Italy-except for the Anglo overlay.  Any cook in any area of the world that lives in a Mediterannean climate would do well to seek out this superb book for it's recpes and Calucicio's writing.	2004-12-27

The observations of Monsieur Farigoule are themselves worth the cost of this wonderful book but Mayle has peppered this vision of Provence with many personalities, each with their own insights into life-as led by themselves and life as led by we who are not lucky enough to share their little bit of peace.<br /><br />Encore Provence began slowly and like a good lecturer, warmed to his topic until the beauty, complexity and warmness of what he saw in Provence opened like a blossom on one of the perennial lavenders that are so prevalent in the countryside.  Mayle writes lovingly of the Mellon King, the organic gardener, the truffle grower, the many builders he encounters and of course Monsieur Farigoule-who alone in this Free Market world has his finger securely in the dyke trying, against all odds, to maintain France and Frenchness.<br /><br />Mayle's book is redolent with stamp-sized mental images of a life that we should all view with an intense envy.  I can only but wish that French frigate would have arrived a day before rather than a day after Sterling's First Fleet arrived here in Australia.  Vive la France!	2004-12-01

I finished reading this wonderful, insightul book several hours ago so the intensity of his final chapters still resonate  with me.  Chapter Seven, The Empire Against Iraq, lays bare the lies and misinformation that the Empire has passed to the world through the media; Ramonet has assembled the facts and at least this juror is convinced of his arguements.<br /><br />I have tried to inform myself of the many strands of the reasons behind Globalization, the Iraq War, Kosovo and the Middle East-to name only four of his eight chapters and I believe the explanations given by him are the best that I have thus far read.  I finisheded his book with great admiration for Ignacio Ramonet because he filled in the pieces of a large and extremely important world picture.  If you read no other book about the politics of the contempoary world, this should be the book you choose.  Other books, as good as they are, do not present the total picture as he does.<br /><br />Of couse his religio-conservative detractors will label him as being \\"a last century leftist\\" who has allowed his political blinkers to obscure his thinking.  After reading his final chapter, Another World Is Possible, those detractors will have scope for many possible books as well as heated Letters to the Editor as they try to demonize him as a socialist and trivialize his arguments as being outmoded thinking.  At the bottom of page 165 he briefly sets forth this programme:  fostering fair trade, annulment of most official debt, protection of indigenous minorities, industries forbiddon from deveoping nonsustainable ecological programmes-only a few-there are at least 15 others..<br /><br />We know that this programme has no chance of being implemented but at least its illumination by Ramonet and others like him mean that not all of the western world has intellectually died from the effects of the conservative mind-wash.	2004-11-16

I was entranced by the extraordinary perspicacity displayed by Melissa P. in this beautifully written and immensely eloquent examination of her adolescence.  I was continually struck in reading her remarkable reminiscences of my own youth and how ignorant I was of the world-I was lucky to have known that the Earth was round rather than flat much less to be aware of all that transpired through Melissa's young life.  She knew of the possibilities-whether she acted upon that knowledge was totally of her own decision and I'm not sure that it should be our business to judge those decisions.  For us it is more a matter of deciding the merits of the memoir she has allowed us to read than to evaluate those decisions based on some preconceived outmoded social restrictions passed down to our times through mythology.<br /><br />Her story as presented to us is one of personal discovery-discovery that lets us share the breakdowns and occasional flat tires of an arduous journey undertaken with an all too open heart but with a wonderfully clear mind.  I was continually conscious of her age as I read of this journey and I marveled at her knowing and her ability to express herself so well.  It's difficult to believe that one so young could, not only experience all that she did but who could also articulate her memories of all that had happened so brilliantly.<br /><br />I found Melissa to be extraordinary, as did Claudio, her last lover.  He told her on page 166 at the very end of the journey [book], \\"... you should never allow me to be the sole purpose in your life.  You're going to be a great woman...\\"  And that is how I will remember Melissa P's \\"100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed\\".	2004-10-26

I was so gob smacked by the things that I read that its been over a month in the reading-here half way 'round the world from the events.<br /><br />In Western Australia we have not been privy to the media fallout from 9/11-our press didn't make mention of the myriad pieces of follow-up news that filled newspapers in the States.  There was a brief mention of a Frenchman who thought the events of 9/11 had American government involvement but after that-nothing.  I was beginning to think I was crazy to even think that this article existed because, as they say, the silence was deafening.  A month ago however, I came acoss Griffin's book with his frequent references to Thierry Meyssan's work and I realized that our press, for whatever reason, had decided to bury any of the controversy surrounding the events of 9/11.<br /><br />As I said, I found the book to be extrmely dense because virtually every paragraph contains massively disturbing information-information that is intricately connected to other bits of complicated information.  The result is a tough read- a read, however, that any person in the world worried about the nature of this planet must concern themselves.<br /><br />For me Griffin's most disturbing pages occurred towards the end-in chapter 7 with the subchapter entitled \\"Missile Defense and a Space Pearl Harbor.\\"  I have been a conspiricist since the Gulf of Tonkin so I am always ready to believe government actions are only the surface and that the carpet hides much dirt; however, even I was unprepared for the mammoth specter outlined by Griffin regarding the plans laid out by the Washinton neocons.

I love reading travel stories and of this genre, I love reading travel stories about travel before people did it as a holiday.  Che wrote about his journey north from his home in Argentina during the early fifties when South America was raw: before sealed roads and motels and fast food stops.  I suppose South America was much the same as North America around the Teens or WWI.<br /><br />I was fascinated by his stories with his traveling companion Alberto's search for Civil Guard [police stations] in small towns where they would connive a meal and a patch of floor space to sleep on for the night.  The next day they would talk a truck driver into letting them ride on his load to the next town and so it went through Argentina [after their motorcycle quit], Chile, Peru, and into Columbia.  This was tough travel-travel unlike anything I've come across and travel that is probably vanished from the world and after you read this you might say, \\"Good riddens\\".<br /><br />Inevitably a sensitive mind like Che's, even at his young age of 23, will absorb the numbing disparity among the people he encounters along the way and eventually react-here you will observe the first mummerings of the revoluionary he was to become.<br /><br />A final word about Guevara the writer-he's 23 with a twenty fourth birthday in  northern Peru and his writing is intense and lyical and knowing-even at this young age.<br /><br />This is a great light read-read it for insights into a life now gone and for insights into the creation of a modern icon.	2004-09-02

Jane Juska has written a marvellously in-your-face book about one of societies taboos-older people having, seeking and then enjoying sex.  She has thumbed her nose at all those in contemporary life who are today's expression of her mother's Victorian standards-people who see what she did as dumb, dangerous and just plain wrong.<br /><br />To me however, she is an extraordinarily strong and courageous<br />woman who has flouted the accepted mores of a strong religious culture. Juska's mother had determined her daughter's early behavioral path and for Jane that path had led in her later years to a void in her being-a void she filled in an inobvious way.<br /><br />As opposed to earlier commentators I found the early chapters- the chapters about Jane before her adventure began-to be more interesting than the book's last part where she unfolds her contemporary adventures.  She readily admits at the book's beginning that she wants, before she dies, to feel a man's touch on her body.<br />The difference between her and most people with unfulfilled life-experiences is that they go unfulfilled-Jane however, set about making sure she had no regrets.  The early stories of her work at San Quentin State Prison were even more of a good read than her sexual adventures-sex stories are more available than stories about English teachers in a big state prison.<br /><br />Jane's book is great-find it and read it and you won't be disappointed.	2004-08-18

Oddly, I purchased this book some time ago but only read it over these past two weeks-a shame because it is a wonderful book and one that has expanded my understanding of all that happened during the centuries of the Crusades.<br /><br />Maalouf's nicely condensed book is a joy to read with many passages from medieval Arab chroniclers and an ability to, for the most part, thread his [and our] way through mightily complex Near Eastern dynastic histories.  I say for the most part because, particularly in Part Three, he gets mired in that political dynastic swamp alluded to previously.  Fortunately he uses that historical patchy ground to launch into a discussion of the rise and dominance Saladin in this political morass.<br /><br />Maalouf, because he is writing from a broader perspective than most Western Crusade historians, has illuminated the Near Eastern stage at the time clearer than the histories that I have read during these past years.  It's strange reading the Crusade histories from this other perspective because it is like looking at a picture that you thought was familiar to you only to discover that you've been looking through a kaleidoscope and it is a little unsettling.<br /><br />A person studies the Crusades through Western histories and their organization usually follows each Crusade from People's through Louis' Afracan debacles; Maalouf however, never mentions these separate crusades-in fact you read of Conrad's drowning death as an event that caused the collapse of a huge band of reinforcements coming to strengthen the seige of Acre.  So these separate crusades that we in the West look upon as normal historiography are passed simply as new bands of reinforcements for events already taking place.<br /><br />If I can criticize Maalouf, and I'm wary of doing so, I would say that for this reader he failed to present a comprehensive picture of all that was taking place in the Near East; rather he gives the reader extraordinarily detailed accounts of the details of dynastic history among a myriad of conflicting city states nominally under an umbrella government but in reality acting totally alone and for their own interests.  And this is why the Crusades had any success at all-not western religious valor but eastern disunity.<br /><br />Maalouf has written a great book and it has my highest recommendation.of the details of dynastic history among a myriad of conflicting city states nominally under an umbrella government but in reality acting totally alone and for their own interests.

I'm not normally a fiction reader but even though &quot;Homeboy&quot; was copywrited in 1990 I ordered and read it because I came across a recent reference to the novel that indicated it was about San Francisco.  Oh yes-it was about The City and although I had lived there many years ago and could still recognize the street names and neigborhoods that was the extent of my recognition.  Seth Morgan penetrates the belly of the beast to an extent that his San Francisco and later California, might just as well be on the dark side of the moon in terms of it's familiarity to what I knew of SF.<br />I know little about fiction writing but I can say that Morgan organized Homeboy differently than the other fiction works I've read.  He has divided Homeboy into short little mini-chapters like many contemporary TV shows-stories built around a particular theme but broken into disparate separate dramas that weave in and out of each other.  You must be aware because these mini-chapters dissolve and reform in new settings and at different times and because the book is so dense be prepared for a demanding ride.<br />This ride is bleak and uncompromising-you will be confronted by situations and activities that I, as a neophyte crime reader, had never been confronted with before.  For instance, the section titled Fence Parole is as hard a piece of writing as you might find or the scene played out in Hotshot-tough stuff for a little suburban guy like me.<br />If you like well writen books that deal with hard subjects then Homeboy is for you-seek it out because it will be worth your time.	2004-07-07

I read Castro's book as part of an ongoing series in my attempt to make sense out of the jumble of political puzzle pieces strewn around in my head.  Only now after many books, many articles and finally this compilation of Castro's speeches can I say that I have a good idea of the picture that is emerging out of the welter of political \\"spin\\" that clouds our contemporary world.<br /><br />I should have read this book three years ago when I started this mammouth mind-puzzle but I did not know that the book even  existed.  Had I known, it would have saved much time because Castro says what all the other writers say but in a far more concise manner.<br /><br />I know, I know-there will be many who dismiss this comment because they believe that a marxist socialist can never be believed even when he is quoting United Nation's facts and figures; however, his facts, figures and interpretations are repeated over and over again by other writers from other countries on other continents.

Jean Markale's book is very dense-it is a book that will challenge any perceptions you might have about what you know about the late medieval period: philosophy, theology and collectively, the heresies that proliferated before the Protestant Reformation.<br /><br />I read this French title in translation and thought, stupidly in hindsight, that I was familiar enough with the general topic of the Cathars and their modest place in the history of France and Europe.  Ah-how wrong I was!  Please don't let me put you off reading Markale's challenging book-just be somewhat aware of what you are in for because the author does not tread lightly over the intricate history of the Cathar theology.  For instance in Part 2 he writes in-depth about Cathar philisophical/theological antecedents: the Mazdeans of ancient Persia, the Gnostics, Manicheans and finally the Bulgarian Bogomils.  Markale is too wise to stitch a seamless sheet leading inexorably to the flowering of Catharism but he does trace the many common points where these early pre-Christian religions meet and the similarities they share with Catharism.<br /><br />There is no dross in this book; seemingly every word, every sentence is a brick in the solid wall Markale is building.<br />His is not a book to skip over and be assured that you will be able to pick up the substance pages-indeed paragraphs-later.  It is a book to be savored.  His first chapter is one of those wonderfully literary compositions where the reader is left wondering if he/she is reading a rich novel or a piece of historical research.  In later chapters this trails off but initially it reads like a beautiful piece of literature.<br /><br />If you have time, background and interest I suggest that you find this wonderful book and enjoy it.	2004-06-01

I finished Krugman's book several hours ago and as a foreigner I was pleased to be able to read many of his past articles that had appeared in the NY Times but had been unknown to me.  Krugman's easy journey through the neocon mysteries of American politics made fascinating and easy reading even for one who is out of the loop of U.S politics.  Although his politics are a little, to say the least, conservative for me and I was unconvinced by the economic spin he gave to much of his writing I still valued the illumination given to the many tortuous paths of Bush conservative \\"thought\\" and actions.<br /><br />Pages 302 to 305 laid bare the extraordinary falsehoods fed to an incrediblly gullable America about the causes of what may turn out to be the biggest American economic scandal since Teapot Dome.  Here in Fremantle we received intermittent and fragmented new's coverage of the California power crisis.  I admit to being inherently distrustful of anything said by any part of American capitalism but even I was not prepared to assume that the power wholesalers were shutting down generator capacity in order to force up prices.  How could capitalism be so bald faced in the land of Disney make believe and Hollywood happy endings?  But, as Krugman and numerous investigative bodies have shown, that is exactly what happened-crude fleecing of the world's fifth largest economy.<br />Again on pages 379-381 Krugman lays bare the greate4st of all American evils [to use George's favorite word] her, by world standard's, extraordinary cheapness.  As Krugman writes on page 380, America \\"... is the Scrooge of the Western world-the least generous rich nation on the planet\\".  For \\"...about a dime a day for each U.S. citizen ...\\" the Americans would double their foreign aid budget and thereby save at least eight million lives a year.  Yet the Americas won't do it, but they will attend their myriad number of churches each Sunday and exit after the service thinking what good people they are and secretly wondering why the world hates them.<br /><br />Krugman's book is a mine of answers to the question of why America acts as it does.ly wondering why the world hates them.

The title of my comments refers not just to the future of Islamic states but further to the nature of Bernard Lewis' book.  Ultimately I found it dissatisfying in that I was led to believe by the book's title that I would find some less nebulous answer posed by the book's title: alas that didn't happen-I was left with as many questions at the end as I was at the beginning.<br />On of the biggest questions  that begged to be answered and in my opinion wasn't is why medieval Islamic culture was so predominant and contremporary Islamic culture is mired in issues that appear to have taken the cultural impetous away from a moribund Islamic society. I realize that in his Conclusion Lewis offers islamic reasons postulated for their feeling of having been passed by as the train of history  passed through the last four hundred years but that concluding chapter left me with the above emptiness-I'm like Dicken's waif, &quot;Is there more Sir&quot;?<br />I found the &quot;meat&quot; of chapter five to be the most satisfying of the book in that Lewis writes at length about the seemingly unbridgeable chasm that separates the militant Islamic world view and the Western world view.  If the most satisfying in one respect it was equally the most disturbing and most depressing because Lewis does not mince words when articulating the vastness of this chasm.  I was shaken by the depth of the abyss: Is there no way to bridge the chasm?  Is there no common ground between total acceptance of militant Islam and death as an infidel?  If Lewis is right in chapter five then millitant Islam must win because its opponents must kill and therefore deny their own intellectual abhorrence of such acts-they win when their opponents lose their life in one scenario or their morality in the other.<br />This possibility is transposed when I can go to Perth airport and travel to Dubai in the United Arab Imirates and see the  lifestyle so hated by the Saudis and the Taliban and Islamic militants in any country.  What's happening here?  Why can the Gulf States avoid the religiolus cataclysm suffered by other Islamic states?

I mean not to trivialize this inciteful book in any way by this title, rather I want to express my surprise and profound admiration for an author far more widely known for his novels than his political commentary for producing a book that has  assembled the dispirit facts surrounding America's ridiculous attack on Iraq.<br />On pages 51,52 and 53 Mailer illuminates clearly the core reason for this attack: he writes that at root, America wants<br />fundamentaly to turn the clock back-to return America to a morally absolute, Christian society and the current government believes by making America into a new Roman Empire these ideals will come to fruition.<br />As an old American who spent too long in the beast's belly, I completely agree with Mailer.  His eblucidation of America's reasons for its current foreign policy fit perfectly with all I remember from an even more innocent America many years ago-how much more true his insights are now on the footsteps of the new millennium.  He writes on page 52, &quot;Once we become a twenty first-century embodiment of the old Roman Empire, moral reform can stride right back into the picture&quot;.<br />There have been mumerous reasons put forward for this terrible Iraqi attack: oil, Israel, vengence, domestic politics but I feel that Mailer's insightful analysis is the best.  He readily admits that he believes that the players at the top of Bush's government don't fully realize why they are doing what they're doing-they are unthinkingly pushing a religiously conservative barrel but not fully understanding why.<br />A hugely thoughtful book-read it and decide for yourself.	2004-03-24

History is for everybody-not just those who know insignificant bits of information about pieces of history but for those who look for keys to the whole picture.  Many of the reviewers of this book missed the point and therefore the importance of Durschmied's  work by presenting the panoply of historical movement.  Historians, and those historical camp followers of their exegesis, seem to take delight in excoriating writers who attempt to trespass on hallowed historical ground by presenting sacrosanct history in ways that can blosom debate and general intellectual intercourse.<br />\\"The Hinge Factor\\" is a superb attempt to shine a torch on some of the murkier areas of European history.  How many people know how poorly the British were led during the early stages of the Boer War or the importance of the battle of Tannenberg to the  history of 20th century?  I loved this book and I feel that there should be more opportunities for readers to argue and confront history and yes, ask questions about \\"what if\\" through the reading of books such as this.  Questions arising from books such as his are the meat of history-of course history must be written carefully-but was &lt;Thucydides \\"trained\\" and his history is, arguably, one of the five greatest historical works in European history.<br />I intend reading his other titles because there is a huge need for his kind of history-history that pulls back the curtains that have clouded our vision when history is left only to the \\"experts\\"	2004-03-09

History books written for the layman can be exceptionally rich and full of easily digestible material and this book by Alan Baker matches that comment perfectly-a book packed with information that he presents in a superb, non-specialist manner.<br /><br />If any reader has paused in their traverse of Roman history from the Republic through the Empire they they must surely ask some very pertinent questions about this peculiar Roman culture of public death in the arena.  I know of no other civilization or culture that needed this public bloodletting and Baker offers some cogent reasons why it should have happened.  Beyond this theorizing, Baker gives us-through ample contemporary quotes from the period-an excellent picture of who gladiators were, why they were, how they fought, with whom they fought, the environment of the combat and finally what happened to both the victors and the defeated.  In short, I would be surprised if anyone not an expert would have any unanswered questions lying around after reading this book.<br /><br />He speculates on questions about the reasons why the Mediterranean basin is denuded of so many animals that are now found only south of the Sahara and why the Roman's would divert so many resources just to provide entertainment for the masses.<br /><br />I recommend this wonderful readable book to any person looking for some answers to a world wide question about a supposedly superior civilization that used the worst blood-sports in human history.

This book is truly a culinary journey and more interestingly I believe a &quot;Coming of Age&quot; in an industry that can vacillate between the life on a road crew in the Arizona desert or the intensity and concentration of a symphony orchestra-the sublime to the ridiculous.<br />Besides the extraordinary insights into restaurants,<br />food preparation and management from the other side of the kitchen trenches, Bourdain gives his readers a funny and trenchant look at the marvelous personalities that have peppered his career. Who could ever forget Bigfoot-the ownership steward par excellence or Steven-Bourdain's right hand sous chef or New York's best baker-Adam-Real Last Name Unknown. The section about Adam alone is worth the cost of the book-even if, and that would be a severe mistake, you read nothing else of this wonderful work.<br />Read this book because it's funny, wise and allows a peek into a foreign world but a world whose edges are familiar to anyone who eats.	2004-02-16

This book constitutes the third in a triolgy of conservative writers, the first two being Lynne Cheney and Ann Coulter, who I have purposely read in order to determine why conservative Americans are so filled with anger regarding the actions, writings and words of people that don't agree with their vision for contemporary America.  For someone like me who has lived far away from the U.S. for many years this little political journey has been both fascinating and maddening and this book straddles both emotions well because Morris, in his first five chapters plays his conservative card and in the final four chapters he plays, dare I say, a more liberal card.<br />I was appalled with the mindless neo-con view of the contemporary world in his chapters on a left-leaning media [ch. 1 &amp; 2], a moral relativist president [ch. 3], a useful but monstrously erroneous chapter which catagorises the 12 major Liberal Apologist Lines [ch. 4] and finally in chapter 5 he excoriates the French for daring to disagree with the  neo-con version of the perfect life.<br />I had absolutely no trouble with his analysis of the many crimes committed in the name of stockholder avarice regarding big tobacco and nursing homes.  In chapter six he illuminates a sorry episode in current American history with a sharp analysis of the problems caused by the machinations of Senators Gramm and Dodd.<br />When I finished his book I thought that he was far more understanding and knowledgable about American domestic affairs than about America's relations with other countries.	2003-12-11

I admit-I don't read fiction because I'm a slow reader and I think there's too much information that I'm missing if I get involved in fiction.

I cannot judge Secret Love by the standards of literary analysis but I can say that he presented an extremely compelling plot-certainly, in my opinion, far removed from anything that would fall under the rubric of &quot;boring&quot;.<br />Schneider's San Francisco falls into that exclusive period between the end of the &quot;Beat&quot; era and the onset of the more<br />popularly known &quot;Hippie&quot; era with one of the main players actually getting a job behind the counter at that city icon of City Lights bookstore.

Fear and Horatio Alger-these are the twin pillars of America and the people now running the American government know it and use, particularly the first one, to attain their goals throughout the world. As a foreigner I  understand these motives and as long as the motivation stays on the other side of the Pacific it wouldn't make much difference what America did.  But as most people know, that's not the way the world works and as far as we are away, we can't escape the poor decisions made by leaders chosen in a country on the other side of the world. That's why Moore's book is addressed to me here in Perth-I can't escape the tentacles of mad U.S. foreign policy, rapacious trade policies and rampant cultural imperialism but I can at least understand why it happens as it does.<br />Michael Moore knows the mechanics of these problems in  that he understands the motivations that drove their development in the States.  The problem is, the very success of America that has put so much money in the pockets of the business aristocracy, is also the problem that demands people throughout the world understand how the giant operates.  America has pushed into other countries and now it must accept that people in those countries judge what is happening to them-it has become our business!  However, we can do almost nothing to protect ourselves from the idiocy emanating from the neocon thinktanks so prevalent in America but at least we can arm ourselves with understanding-the understanding of what makes the bull do what it does.<br />Moore has identified many of the pegs that neocon governmental policy has hung its various domineering hats on as the means to make, first the U.S. and eventually the rest of us, do their bidding.  I can only hope that his fervent wishes in chapter 11 come true in some form-be it Oprah, Dean or Clark.  The world needs anyone besides Dubya-please!	2003-11-13

However because it is the begginning of our warm weather and my thoughts turned today to outdoor cooking I immediately looked at this book because it is the absolute best book on outdoor cooking and that led me to wondering if his cooking books are available to Americans and it is, albeit only through special order.  That's sad because this book on outdoor cooking as well as the three others that I own [dealing with indoor cooking] is a first rate collection of extremely tasty as well as extremely easy to prepare recipes.<br />Here in Australia, and I think that it is much the same in the U.S., I always sit down to over-cooked beef steak accompanied by a range of salads: pasta, iceberg lettuce, potato and little else.  The prawn on the barbie is a myth, at least among my friends here in Western Australia.  Ainsley, however, never considers a steak or snag cooked as is; rather, he will take a piece of meat and wrap it in a blue cheese spinkled pancake or skewer some fillet and after it's cooked serve it with a Argentinian hot sauce-he makes outdoor cooking easy, different and interesting.<br />If you can get your hands on this wonderful book-do so immediately!	2003-11-05

I bought and read this book for the same reason I bought one of Lynne Cheney's books-I wanted to read what the American conservatives wrote themselves rather than relying on their words and ideas after being passed through the minds of commentators.  Unfortunately I found out exactly what is in the mind of Ann Coulter and it isn't pretty.<br />Besides the normal conservative concerns that peppered the first 14 pages she lets the reader know where her mind is when she writes, \\"America is in an epic global battle with ruthless savages who seek our destruction...\\"  Back in the Sixties in my rural high school the english teachers told their students to drop loaded words like savages from our writing because their implications were too loaded to be used in in sophomore writing-I guess Ann attended a better school than I where they made exceptions to correct speech because she used the same word on at least five more occasions.<br />Besides being the embodiment of all the reasons why political correctness needs to be, Ann as a spokesperson for neoconservatism, has illuminated all the reasons why that political movement is transforming a rational country into a bastion of dangerous unthinking.  She spends considerable time decrying the inept international moves by Democratic presidents since World War II ended but not offering even a hint about what to do.  She picks apart liberal thinking with regard to international relations but she never offers a conservative answer to why the problem exists in the first place.  She believes that world problems materialize out of thin air and assuredly America's force can correct the problem there and then without pointy eared professors dirtying the water of reason by suggesting that there might be very cogent reasons for the existence of this particular problem.  Ann Coulter paints with an exceptionally  wide brush but as with the nature of paint the covering is wafer thin-her world view, as well as the neocons trying to guide it, cannot offer the world any direction in substantive change or adaption to differing circumstances.<br />Ann spent an entire chapter enumerating the reasons why we should all be enthralled by Ron Reagan's bludgeoning death of the Soviet Union so that America could win the Cold War.  After this chapter and another six I kept thinking, how naive can the author be-how can she keep swallowing the propaganda lines formulated and distributed by the various instruments of the American government?  Throughout her book, Ann repeats exactly the words we are programmed to absorb-she is the best example  of the continued working of the propaganda machine.<br />I guess the book's title says it all-if you disagree with Ann Coulter and the shallowness she writes about then you are a traitor.  I always thought that disagreement was the backbone of democracy-just not Ann's democracy I suppose.nnot offer the world any direction in substantive change or adaption to differing circumstances.<br />Ann spent an entire chapter enumerating the reasons why we should all be enthralled by Ron Reagan's bludgeoning death of the Soviet Union so that America could win the Cold War.

I first encountered this extraordinary history back in the early '70s as a medieval student and then again some years ago beyond study and therefore with considerably more money-at least compared to a student-and I was able to purchase this wonderful set.<br />I freely admit not having read the three volumes cover to cover but have parachuted in to various topics within the span of information covered by the set and I can attest to the brilliance of Runciman's writing.  He represents the best of historical writing in that he is the undoubted master of his sources and their subject matter but he can also convey the extraordinary complexity of these centuries in a writing style that is at once understandable and also colourful.  To my mind he is the best of the best because, as undoubted master of his subject, he is also able to tease out and convey the human interest, the drama and the wrenching saddness of all that was the Crusades.<br />Steven Runciman has transcended history as few other historians of any time have been able to do.  He has imbued the structure of history with the richness of a night at the opera or theatre-the reader is presented with the panoply of humanness at every turn and I believe this is the true mark of a master's hand.	2003-08-02

As an inveterate buyer, reader and user of cookbooks I found this book one of the best that I've recently used.  Living as I do in Australia, it was released here for the Christmas season of '02 and was not at the time available for comment through Amazon so I was pleased to see it listed today when I had a check.  It is a first-rate cookbook and I'm sure those that use it's recipes will be happy with the results.<br />I am taken by the quality of the photos that are an exceedingly important part of the book.  It therefore becomes a joy to read because of those excellently selected and arranged photos.  Beyond the visual is of course the substance of the book with its collection of recipes-the body of which are not the usual ones found in collections of French cooking.<br />My wife and I have tried a large example of them and they have proved to be easily cookable and extremely tasty and we anticipate further culinary discoveries as the weeks go by.<br />This marvelous cookbook is as good as it is, I believe, because the grandmother of Joanne Harris cooked many of these country dishes after they had been passed to her from her grandmothers. The French Kitchen has a decidedly country kitchen take on French cooking and believe me, the book does not suffer because of it.<br />I loved reading every word in this wonderful book and also loved looking at the inspired photographs and thought all the while that the people at Doubleday who designed such a beautiful book deserve a large bonus for assembling such a delightful book.	2003-07-30

Why, you have every right to ask, did I take over a year to complete a relatively small book and the answer lies in the fact that I feel Mr. Ali's book is several books in one and therefore you can read one part as complete unto itself.<br />The topics that Ali explores are diverse but all of immense importance to America as she tries to feel her way in a world that is hostile to her much valued beliefs.  Everybody in the world knows that America is hell-bent on building the first world empire but Ali's book is the best indication that goal, if it happens, will be more costly than the Washington conservatives think it will be.<br />If there are any of those conservatives who would like an insight into the movements of the contemporary world, I suggest that they grasp the contents of chapter 19, if little else in Ali's book, because no more need be read to have an insight into the ways of our modern world.<br />Further, chapter 16 on his country-Pakistan-will not only illuminate an area of the world that for many decion-makers is still a blank-a blank whose mysteriousness will, and perhaps already has, lead to involvement mistakes that will haunt this new empire for many years to comme.<br />As one commentator said-this book is a modern political classic that should be read by all who think to captain the ship of this empire.	2003-07-28

I'm also not a fast reader and started Cybill Disobedience almost exactly two months ago and read it at the same time as several other books but I didn't skip any bits because Cybill Shepherd writes well and writes about interesting topics.<br />Ms Shepherd immediately grabbed my interest because she's a Boomer as I am and I found that the events of her early life were recognizable to me even though I lived on the other side of the States and in a vastly different environment.  I enjoyed her childhood observations and although her life had little to do with the life I'd led, those observations were accurate on a universal level.  However,I found her biography a little hard to relate to in the final chapters-not a reflection on her writing but a reflection of my own contemporary distance chronologically and geographically from the personal warfare that seems to be part of the Hollywood playing field.<br />When all has been said, I thought her prose was a reflection of her speech-quick, slightly acerbic, intelligent and levened with deadpan humour.  Cybill Disobedience was a wonderful read and I would recommend it to anyone.	2003-07-26

I lived in The City from '67 to '73 and was there during the heyday of Haight Ashbury and the mammoth explosion of all that was pre-Altimont but for some strange reason Beat San Francisco was far more important in my memory than The Haight.  The reasons probably have much to do with why I finished Morgan's short book in only a day because I became so involved in his descriptions of the places that I considered my San Francisco-all of Upper Grant after it crosses Columbus with Caffe'  Trieste and the New Pisa and of course City Lights, Discovery and Vesuvio with Tosca watching from the other side of the street.<br />Even though I now live on the other side of the planet, these places are burned into my memory.  They're memories of cold winter evenings searching for the inevitable bargain in Discovery and then going next door to City Lights to troll through its basement looking at all the titles that I wanted but couldn't afford as a student.  And on Saturday afternoons going into Trieste and buying a cafe' and knowing that not so many years ago this place was the epicenter for guys that wore old berets, had beards and thought.<br />I am indebted to Bill Morgan for writing such a heartwarming look back at a time and place that will go on in the hearts of Americans that realize there was a recent time when things could have gone another way.  It didn't happen but with people like him keeping the memory alive and people who care enough to take pictures of City Lights for people like me who remember- perhaps all has not been lost.<br />Buy the book and revisit these modern American icons before they are redeveloped.	2003-07-16

I grew up on Tolowa land-out my back door was a large shell-dump and I assume that my house was built on the Tolowa village that made that dump.  Also out my back door and across Lake Earl was slender Lake Talowa connecting the bigger lake to the Pacific Ocean.<br />I write this with great saddness in my heart having just read again on page 36 that 40 years ago there were only \\"... ten full-blooded Tolowans [that] could be found living there [Del Nort County] who could remember any useful history of old tribal living.\\"<br />I feel terrible that I lived on the bones of a lost society but I realize my words could be repeated ad nauseam over virtually the entire American continent with the wonderful exception of the Inuit state in northern Canada.<br />The Tolowa were of no harm to anyone and yet, even as a kid I heard stories of unreported massacres on the Smith River perpetrated by the same kind of land-hungry unscupulous pioneers that were the norm throughout America.<br />My parents lived on Tolowa land long after the native Americans had been forced away and I'm glad I do not know the particulars of that \\"pioneering effort\\" when earlier white settlers forced the Tolowans from their lands.<br />In my saddness I thank you Mary Null Boule'for bringing the meager scraps of knowledge that still exists of these people to the attention of the general reader-a society with no chiefs nor desire to do more than live in what my father said was \\"God's country\\".	2003-06-27

Reading his analysis of what is really happening rather than what the media wants us to believe is happening makes his books like Clift's Notes for those who want to understand how and why the world is as it is.  As to those who refuse to see the world's operations as they are and dismiss Chomsky as an unpatriotic liberal I can only say, as he does, that the US is just the most recent of a long line of empires that manipulate the world as their plaything.  The US is not the worst nor will it be the last but it is incumbent on us all to realize what is going on and why these actions are taking place,<br />To read the numbing ignorance of letter writers to my local newspaper is enough to establish that the world must have a Chomsky-not to dismantle the American Empire but simply to recognize what it is and what it is doing and why it's doing it.<br />To blindly and mindlessly accept the evil in the world is to invite that evil into your house-to feed it and offer a soft bed and a soft blanket.  If evil is kept at arms length then you are not participating in the catalogue of evil incidents that were created in other people's backyards.  A blind acceptance is to become a participant in the monstrous events being carried out in your name but to know the nature of the beast at least insulates you to a feeble extent.

I don't know why other commentators are so hard on this book-its not as if we are bombarded by books dealing with the subject of Chinese maritime history and can afford to be snooty about our perceptions of the author's outcomes.  As someone with a modest background in Chinese history I thought that Levathes completed a much needed examination about a subject that doesn't sit comfortably with many self proclaimed intellectuals who don't like to have their comfortable conceptions about the organization of world history upset by a new history that challenges their comfortable mind-set.<br /><br />I believe there is an all too apparent racial motive working in some commentaries regarding the immensity of the entire topic of Chinese maritime history.  As Levathes describes so well the Chinese, back as far as the Han Dynasty, were sailing ships far larger to far more distant destinations than anything matched by the Europeans for centuries and yet the general Western reader fumbles in the dark for any information that counters the West's disinformation.<br /><br />What is going on?  I live on the west coast of Australia and here in Fremantle a replica of Cook's Endeavour was built some years ago and more recently a replica of the Duyfken or Little Dove, the first European ship to chart a portion of the Australian continent was completed.  But was there even a hint in any of the local or national news at the time that the English and the Dutch were simply sailing in the path of decades of previous Chinese occupation-of course not!<br /><br />Levathes final chapter recounts numerous examples of Chinese presence in the Northern Territory long before the Duyfken and  Cook's south eastern exploration.  Many readers seem to nit-pic this book as well as the Menzie's book to death rather than dealing with the extraordinary ramifications of the import of each book's substance-we're left with a few niggling little bits of argument that simply detract from the greater story being told.<br /><br />If you have even a passing interest in Chinese history then you owe it to yourself to read this wonderful, enlightening examination of Chinese maritime history and it's impack throughout Asia and beyond.of each book's substance-we're left with a few niggling little bits of argument that simply detract from the greater story being told.

Even though I found this book very interesting and finished reading it in a short amount of time, at its completion I found myself disappointed because the book was not the book I thought it was going to be.<br />This is the kind of statement that I hate others to make-damn the object: book, movie, play, painting etc. because its not what you would like it to be.  In this case, however, I feel more than normally justified because the author focuses her writing skills on painting a picture, not so much of her life in a war ravaged city but of how humans regained control over that city.<br />The difference is important because in her diary entries starting in '46 the author deals almost exclusively with discussions of currency manipulations and political maneuvering-these topics are of extraordinary weight in post war Berlin but I had hoped that she would give me more information about Berlin's physical face.<br />I wanted to know more about living in a city that was a complete mess-what were the jobs and wages for those jobs and apartments and the resurrection of essential services and a myriad collection of other day to day themes.  A reader can't, however, damn a writer for failing to write the book the reader would have liked.<br />Having said all of this, I believe that Ruth Andreas-Friedrich has written a wonderful book-a book I would recommend to any person with a passing interest in those over-looked pieces of history that are left in the air at the end of a book or a professor's lecture.  You read a general history or listen to a lecture series and you're left with questions about the details of what happened, in Berlin's case, when the boombs stopped falling and the Russian troops left.  In this case the writer completes much of the picture.	2003-04-22

There seem to be commentators who will go to great lengths to prove that Haig and those staff around him were really not bad generals: we wern't there, we don't have enough information, we're colonials who couldn't possibly understand and anyway, their actions saved us from an evil fate so all is forgiven.<br />Haig's people-grinder can be masked by sophistry and the belittling of arguments through the many stings of petty facts; however, I'm sorry to say but the book was a superb contribution to righting the many wrongs of a myopic and severly parochial cadre of historians that simply can't see, refuse to see or prefer to maintain the myth that these fools knew their job.<br />How can any person with a modicum of intelligence accept casualty figures of 250,000 for a five mile dent in German lines at Passchendaele and this was only one example of Haig's military \\"brilliance\\"-Laffin has an entire book full of facts like these.<br />Again, I am sorry for writing such a bad comment-I'm sure I'd get the cuts for composing such a sorry couple of paragraphs. The point however is salient because that was, perhaps still is, the soft under belly of the British military-its refusal to accept criticism and that refusal leading to the covering up  of unbelievable military horrors committed by its military elite.  They seemed to be awash in \\"form\\"-function be damned-the soldiers attacking the ineffectual, in Haig's view, machine guns will get through if they walk and not run in clean uniforms.	2003-03-19

John Pilger has stared into the abyss of the post World War II world and seen lies, obfuscations and Red Herrings thrown out to an extraordinarily gullible world public. You ask, \\"Who would do such a monstrous thing\\"? And surprise, surprise the name that continually surfaces is good ol', kind Uncle Sam-Uncle Sam in Indonesia, Somalia, Middle East, Central America, Chile, Caribbean, Afghanistan and now Iraq.<br />Pilger looks at all these places and more and the poor reader is muddied as they get pulled into a story that many of us know but probably have not stitched together as tightly as Pilger gives us. \\"The New Rulers of the World\\" is a small book of only 207 pages in the hardback version and those are small pages so the reading will not take long-the digestion, however, will take considerably longer.<br />As someone who has lived outside the States for some thirty years I know the difficulty of coming to grips with the monstrous nature of the country that I was born in and lived in for my early, formidable years but I also know the truth of what Pilger, himself an Australian, sees in this botched civilization that is now the world's only superpower.<br />The picture the reader is left with after reading this book is one of a people in denial-denial that the America of their childhood, the America of Iwo Jima, Normandy, Ellis Island, Cherry Trees and myriads of other photo ops and sound bites could be anything but loved and honoured by the world's tied, poor and hungary. Those that know the fiction just keep pumpping out the lies; keeping those people wrapped in their ignorance and thereby keeping the reigns of control firmly in their hands.<br />...	2003-02-11

Gavin Menzes spent his life in the British navy, retiring as a submarine captain who journeyed the same courses set by the fifteenth century Chinese in their treasure fleets.  Unlike others, I believe his theory about these treasure fleets predating by centuries the European \\"discoveries\\" of the Americas, Antartica and Australia.  I believe that we in the West are guilty of very stupid Eurocentrism by continuing to maintain in the face of worldwide evidence to the contrary the Columbus and Cook myth of initial \\"discovery\\".<br />I fully admit that I can't read a navigation chart, have no firsthand knowledge of sailing and wouldn't know which end of a sextant is which but his extraordinary amassing of hard evidence is, to my mind, irrefutable and as such he has written a mamothly explosive book!<br />The question that should haunt the reader through Menzie's unfolding tale is why we weren't told earlier-why did I spend so many years drinking at the fountain of English, Spanish, Dutch and Portugese \\"discovery\\" and the answer seems to be that, as Menzies accurately points out, nobody has had the practical knowledge of ancient map reading to formulate an alternative theory.  Historians of course have tremendous literary skills but how many historians can read and interpret ancient navigation charts?  The information in this book has always been there but nobody put the scattered pieces together.  Menzies' greatness is that he had the knowledge to gather, what to others were unimportant pieces of trivia, and out of that mess to form a truly revolutionary story-at least to my clouded Western eyes.<br />Regardless of my poor ability to write a decent comment you owe it to yourself to read this fabulous book-it will confound you, interest you and eventually excite you as few other books ever have.	2003-01-14

I'd like to think that I understand how the puzzle pieces fit together but I need people like Vidal to illuminate the connections, to see the picture rather than the mass of pieces strewn on the table.  To take the metaphor further, he provides the picture on the puzzle box that shows you what you will eventually have when the pieces are together.<br />I find that with the daily blizzard of new's facts coming into my house that it's like sitting down to a twenty thousand piece jigsaw that strangely has no border.<br />Vidal throws out bits of history and then provides the connections allowing a picture to form-seemingly from random occurrences.  I found after reading this wonderful, insightful little book that all the disparate post-WWII facts came together.  Yes-call me stupid for not seeing the connections earlier but my defense is this continuous blizzard of facts that  shower me-this blizzard is in itself designed to do just what it is doing to me and millions of others.<br />One little bit from this tiny read-living as I do in Australia, I could never see why what happened to Clinton happened-everybody here knew he was being undermined since he came into office. We didn't get much coverage of his attempt to rework the healthcare system-Vidal says very matter of factly that Clinton's attempt at this reworking was his undoing.  The conservatives that orchestrated his downfall didn't want Americans to have what people in nearly every other government in the developed world have-what we in Australia take for granted-universal health care.<br />I'm sorry most Americans will miss reading this book because they will see it as \\"devil phoolosophy\\"-the powers at work have done a fabulous job for themselves.	2002-12-11

I thought this book was an excellent journey into historical areas that are far too often closed for people who are not experts in the particular subject under examination.<br />Cantor's writing is unfamiliar to me and therefore I was very pleased with his uncommon ability to see into the particulars of his topic and highlight them in order that they do not become awash in a sea of historical detail.<br />Too often historians, although masters of their topic and its place in history,  fail miserably at expressing the uniqueness and inherent interest that is possessed by that topic when it is disrobed for general readers-Cantor is a disrober of history and I believe we the readers are much the better for it to have happened.<br />I found that Cantor was able, better than nearly all of his peers, to take a long-range view of the events he describes for us-he was able to step out of the maelstrom of those events he  illuminates for his readers and take a long, measured view of those events-his breadth of vision means that we readers can<br />begin to mould the information he presents so that our judements and interpretations begin take form.<br />I think this is the best kind of historical writing-a master at the peak of his form who does not need to pander to those with professional standing but who do not have his writing ability.	2002-11-01

Be prepared for a long, very detailed examination of the morass that America was pushed into during the last decade of the last millennium.Brock's book is an extraordinary read-one which took many hours because of its complexity and length; the reader isn't pepared [at least this reader!] for a book designed with such narrow margins, few notes and with no index-a book where everything is meant to be read.As an Australian I was unprepared for the depth of Brock's analysis-I was unprepared for the breadth of the scandal and the huge cast of players in this tragedy as well as the very real personal metamorphosis that unfolded as I read his book. In a strange way it was as if these changes were the canvas upon which would eventually be painted the enormoussaga of the Clinton years.Other reviewers have commented negatively that if Brock lied, as he admitted he did in his early journalistic years, then it would be natural to disbelieve his last transformation into a liberal. However, I was struck by the sincerity of Brock's transformation-my only question involved his seemingly ease of movement from Berkley to journalist in the belly of the beast at the Spectator in Washington. Having read some of the books written by prominent conservative figures, I am left wondering how conservatives can harbour so much anger-the stress that Brock was made to endure speaks volumes for the pettiness of mind within the conservative movement.	2002-10-13

I purposely bought and read Lynne Cheney's book because I want to understand why conservatives are so mad and what the objects of their anger are-this book was a primer for understanding many elements of a diseased mind.I read this book noting the many topics that distress her, and collectively the American conservatives all the while thinking that these are not new issues-they were being argued about and discussed 40 years ago and yet she seems bewildered by them-as if they are new and were just thrust onto the intellectual stage in the last decade.  It's appalling that soneone who played centre stage in the Reagan circus could be so unaware of popular trends that she is surprised by these social-political movements germinating far back in the last century--where's she been?  As I read the book and realized the many streams of current thinking that upset her, I realized that they all seemed perfectly normal to me-they are ideas that are the norm here in Western Australia-ideas that wouldn't raise an eyebrow yet seem to cause firestorms of outrage among American conservatives. You read her book and wonder what's the problem-of couse the things she/conservatives worry about are correct-the way things should be in their mind.  After reading this book, you realize the author has missed a continent of factual material because it is impossible to think the way she does, and likewise all her supporters, unless you have been blinkered during your adult life.	2002-10-03

I say at the onset that I have been convinced by the blizzard of archaeological facts presented by David Keys in support of his theory that it was a major climate catastrophe that occurred around 535AD that was the primary cause for worldwide social and political upheavals during subsequent years. I can easily recall sitting in lectures in the sixties and wondering why certain events happened when they did but never questioning the established, albeit very murky, chain of events laid out in the historical calendar-this calendar being the accepted pattern of unfolding world historical events even though that pattern didn't explain some huge questions that loomed in the mind of an untutored student. Key's has assembled a collection of data from geographically disparate regions of the world and this extensive body of data corroborates, in my opinion, his thesis; I thank him for illuminating the engine for the worldwide string of monumental disruptions that began roughly around 535AD.	2002-09-30

Catherine Millet is a writer of distinction who, perhaps because of her life addiction to the sexual act, has decided to write intellectually about something that is so much a part of our existence but all too often because of religion,  relegated to the<br />shadows.  Ms. Millet has confrounted that which has remained in the shadows and because of her extraordinary writing ability has been able to analize sex dispassionately and has therefore treated the act as an activity to be studied with conclusions drawn and judgments made.<br />By using this approach she has been able to analyze sexual activities without the \\"what's in it for me\\" of the male porn approach that unfortunately seems to rule the media today.<br />I was immensely taken by her French \\"intellectual posturing\\" so disdained by an earlier commentator because the beauty and depth of 209 pages of, not her sexual experiences but what she intellectualized about those experiences.<br />As many commentators have written this is not a book about the porn view of sex-it's a book about one woman's recollections of what she saw, felt and experienced in many and varied physical situations.  She had an extraordinary ability to dissect minutely the various  parts of the overall act: she talked about locations, times, numbers, duration and anything else that was part of the whole.  However, and this is what will upset the unknowing reader, she only dealt obliquely with the porn topics that we have come to expect by vastly inferior writers.<br />Catherine Millet uses sex as a canvas upon which she paints her amazing view of the sexual landscape-a read not to be missed.<br />\\"The Sexual Life of Catherine M.\\" is a mine of a book-one that can be referred to many, many times because of Ms. Millet's writing brilliance.	2002-08-05

I confess immediately to being a conspiracy believer: whenever people say I'm mad for believing the strange theories that people present, I always am reminded of the old saying, \\"Where there's smoke there's fire\\" and the ski's full of billowing smoke after reading Eisen's book!<br />Suppressed Inventions is one of those books that you can easily read and put down and then go back to weeks later because each chapter can be read alone-it is only the totality of all that he writes that leaves you looking for a very stiff drink after you finally put his book down.<br />I do not have a scientific mind and found the going in several of his chapters reasonably hard; however, this comment is in no way meant to steer any prospective readers away from this extraordinarily rich mine of very necessary material for anybody who would like to keep their fingure on the pulse of the new millennium.<br />Of the many lights that Eisen has switched on in this remarkable book perhaps the most astounding is chapter 27-\\"Did NASA Sabotage Its Own Space Capsule?\\"  Aftert reading it I admit to being skeptical-I mean to believe that Grissom, White and Chaffee were murdered by NASA meant that there was no moon landing and that the whole Appollo 11 thing was staged on a secret base in Nevada-whoa!<br />I was skeptical until two weeks ago when I watched a prime-time TV doco about the theory held by many people that the moon landings were phoney.  It's not beyond the realm of possibility that just because the US government says the whole theory is laughable  doesn't meam that it's laughable.<br />My sggestion-buy the book and draw your own conclusions.  Even if you think it's all rubbish then at the very least you are left with a compendium of many of the current theories about the truth of what we're allowed to know.	2002-07-25

The conservatives offer the same logically mangled reasoning as they did then-\\"there is no problem\\", \\" Moore has his facts wrong\\"or \\"nothing a radical says can be true\\"- I've heard it all before.  The one-star comments that I've read regarding this book could have been lifted from conservative news columnists anytime during the last 50 years-if nothing else all these whackos are tenacious!<br />People have written that they enjoyed Moore's book because it was so funny-I hardly cracked a smile during my read of the book [I thought that the facts and statistics were all too true and scary and as I wrote, I've seen the same sorts of bad guys try to get away with the same sorts of illusions as they did 30 years ago]..<br />I guess his book was so scary because no one in the States is going to do anything about the problem-the conservatives don't think there is a problem and anybody that identifies something that needs fixing, then a  moronic commentator comes along and says, \\"Don't worry-the lefty's have their facts wrong and the problem only exists in their head\\".<br />All of this shouldn't concern me now because I live in a smart country that pretty much knows what it's doing and tries to level the playing field for everyone-regardless of background.  The problem is the fact that there's a big, dumb bull in the china shop<br />and everybody must take an interest in what the bull is going to do.everyone-regardless of background.

I loved every word of this book; I am new to his writing having not read this work Kitchen Confidential so his approah to his craft was surprising and refreshing.<br />I was particularly impressed with his total love for the craft/art of food preparation and his total enjoyment of the products in their many guises of that craft/art.  I must use these terms together because, as he so clearly shows in his book, preparing sheeps head soup in the back garden of a colleague in Mexico is one thing but eating the other-worldly creations of Thomas Keller at the French Laundry in the Napa valley is decidedly something else.<br />I took Bourdain at face value: when he said after entering a pub in Edinburgh, \\"I'm never leaving\\" or in Nha Trang, Vietnam  after many good experiences says, \\"I love it here\\" or in Russia drinking vodka with black bread and sausage that it was \\"in many ways a perfect meal\\"  you're left with a profound respect for a person who can love his surroundings and the food of those surroundings so much.<br />I was impressed with his obvious love for the people, the places and the culinary glue that held it all together: as food lovers we can appreciate these feelings but to find them duplicated and articulated so well by a professional chef makes for a very good and heartwarming read.<br />If you like food and travel you could not find a better book in which to indulge yourself.	2002-07-11

As opposed to earlier commentators I do not come from a background rich in  readings on the subject of the Holocaust and therefore Witness came as a unexpected  mine of memories of people that had experienced the unimaginable.<br />My knowledge of the events of the Holocaust were almost exclusively from video documentaries and those documentaries had left many unanswered questions: questions about the Transportation, about the Marches after the camps closed late in the war, about the closing of the ghettos, about the long-term hiding, about the massive anti-semitism that greeted the survivors after  the war upon returning \\"home\\" and finally the Jewish guerrilla bands that sprang up throughout eastern Europe.<br />The remarkable thing about this great exercise is the broadness of the interviews that compose the book: the authors assembled a very wide ranging collection of these interviews that spoke about all the topics that I had only heard snatches about in the video documentaries.  It was all the more remarkable because these were all primary sources-they were not what somebody had interpreted but the memories of the people that lived the experience and because of this the book had an enormous impact on this reader.<br />I am a slow reader and the book absorbed me totally and I finished it in a matter of days.<br />If you read no other book about the Holocaust-read this one.	2002-06-26

Any book by Noam Chomsky will immediately be rejected by myopic conservatives who dismiss him as a mindless liberal or a dangerous socialist and yet those conservatives are exactly who should read this analysis of American foreign policy.I have been rummaging around in the history and contemporary politics of a reasonable part of the globe for many years and the way in which Chomsky pieces together the world that we live in is totally accurate according to the information that I have accumulated.In this book Chomsky has assembled the various interviews he has given to journalists from around the world and will throughout this short book illuminate his ideas as to why September 11 happened. I'm sure that the power brokers of America will be dismissive of what Chomsky says in these interviews and they will use their traditional bent and ignorant interpretation of contemporary affairs to justify policies that determined the events of September 11. It's appaling for the world to realize that while the Americans do not understand this world there are people like Chomsky who do  but who are marginalized and derided while others who know little more than barrel-pushing make decisions that impact negatively all of us.	2002-06-21

I must share space with those readers who see in Brook's thesis a very sharpe and insightful probe into what constitutes contemporary America's geist. I do believe that Brook's has succeeded in illuminating the social constructions of a society, that for better or worse  determines the pathways of our world.  I was very absorbed by his dissection of the &quot;war&quot; that has taken place between old knowledge and the newer post WWII knowledge of the educated elite. Of coursee elites whether new or old are going to throw their new wealth at places that can be severely criticised and lauged at but Brookes is simply showing us what has taken place not trying to defend what he has observed going on around him. Don't kill the ambassador because you don't like the message. Given America's extraordinary power in the post-WWII world it is incumbant on an author/scholar to attempt to make sense of what is going on in this mammoth historical engine of our times and I believe David Brooks has done a brilliant job of elucidating  the many factors constituting it's nature.	2001-06-10

Most readers would have a reasonably good knowledge of the events that took place on HMS Bounty in 1789 and they might even know the details of why the Bounty sailed and what happened to Bligh after he and those of the crew that didn't mutiny were set adrift in the Bounty's long boat.  I would guess however that only a handful of people anywhere in the world would have an idea of what happened to the mutineers after they landed on Pitcairn and burnt their only means of escape-the Bounty herself. Trevor Lummis has done a tremendous job of research by stringing together all the odd bits of scattered information  in order to present the whole bloody, sordid story of the events that ultimately left only one male alive on the island plus a number of  Polynesian women who were part of the original group.  What happened to the mutineers and the Polynesian men that went with them to Pitcairn is the subject of this book and what an extraordinary story it is!  Hollywood missed it by building a movie around the mutiny-they should have filmed the story of the events after the mutiny. Anybody with even a miniscule curiosity about the incidents on Pitcairn owe it to themselves to savor this wonderfuly readable story.	2000-11-26

I am not an expert on the Civil War much less on the battle of Antietam but as a read about the substance of battle for the muscat-holding soldier in any Civil War engagement, Priest's book is about as good as is available. The wealth of primary sources-letters, diaries,newspaper articles,anything that illuminates this battle from the viewpoint of the average soldier, is brought into his examination.  The result is a compilation of incidents that gives essence to the terror and, in modern view, numbing bravery of the action's soldiers were ordered to undertake as a matter of course-not as something only asked under extraordinary circumstances.  The reader must ponder the nature of the glue that bound men to do things that any sane person would find impossible-yet the impossible was normally asked and just as normally undertaken.  Antietem: A Soldier's Battle should be read by any person unfamiliar with the Civil War as the first book they read because it will give the reader a grasp of the nature of the conflict from the receiving end of muscat volleys and cannonballs in full sight bouncing along the ground ready to shatter any living creature in its path. I had not encountered any book from any period of history that cast any light on the subject of animals in war-specifically the horses that pulled the artillery or provided transport for officers. Again, Priest's book was very illuminating in these dark corners of often forgotten history. Read this book-you will not regret it.	2000-11-09

I purchased this book without having any firsthand knowledge of it as a background source and I haven't been minutely disappointed. Kadzis assembled both primary and secondary sources either from the time of the Civil War or from more modern secondary source writings about aspects of that war.  In any case the extracts were singularly well chosen and are valuable for my purposes. I would recommend Kadzis' compilation to any person searching for a single source of Civil War rememberances written at the time or of modern fiction writers using the events of that war around which to build their longer story. The writings he has selected are very useful and interesting.	2000-11-02

I completed reading Rule By Secrecy last night and am left with a considerable bag of thoughts, questions and concerns-concerns about who we are and how much of what is happening and has happened in world affairs is &quot;real&quot;.  For one book to accomplish this much is truly a herculean task and to trivialize the many conclusions expressed by Marrs is to fail to understand the true enormity of the deceit being worked on the population of the world. This is not to say that I accept unquestionably all the author's conclusions but the thrust of the book is valid  and those conclusions dealing with the ability of the popular media to purvey the truth of international events is decidedly valid. As world citizens we are at the mercy of those that feed us the news with their own commentary and we accept their version to the exclusion of non-mainstream media.  This is the true import of Marrs' book-we know nothing but that which we are allowed. This book should be read by any person who wishes to be more than a  passive member of the planet.	2000-10-23

I have just completed Mark Burnett's book and I am very impressed with his sensitive and rational analysis of the events on Pulau Tiga culminating with Richard Hatch leaving the island as the ultimate winner.  I didn't expect Burnett's book to be so cerebral: I expected a very long journalistic expose of &quot;the hidden secrets of life on the island&quot;.  Burnett wrote, however, a far more substantive story of the psychological factors that motivated the participants.  I was impressed with these psychological threads that he teased out of life on the island; to the viewer these  were seemingly random acts made by the island participants.  It was as if the show that I viewed every week was simply the building that was visible above the ground but the complexity of the foundations that allowed the structure to stand were totally hidden until they were pointed out and examined by Burnett. Had I not read his book I would not have appreciated the extraordinary drama that took place-the drama of  Pagong and their immaturity in regard to virtually all aspects of the establishment of a viable community and that failure  led ultimately to their destruction.  In hindsight the game's outcome was known before the first Challenge, if only I'd been as good an observer as Burnett. Without putting too much spit on the pitch, I think that the show transcended entertainment and took the reader into the realm of literary drama because of the insight it offered the viewer [with Burnett's book as a  necessary guide] into the human complexities of such a situation.	2000-10-11
