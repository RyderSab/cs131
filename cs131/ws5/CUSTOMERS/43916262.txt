Unfortunately... I was somewhat disappointed. At first, the characters and the story are fairly interesting, but it quickly deteriorates from there. After the first few chapters, it was hard for me to continue reading because the story and characters no longer held any interest for me. The uninspired writing did nothing to help alleviate any of this. While I did eventually finish this novel, I cannot find anything positive to say about &quot;The Angel and the Sword&quot;.	2001-08-24

One thing I found completely astonishing is that the students at this college were actually playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons in tunnels that ran under the school. I am a fan of the game, but what these kids did was a bit much. Anyway, this book is a good read for anyone who enjoys true stories.	2001-08-24

This book goes along with the series that was seen on the Discovery Channel recently. The many pictures are absolutely stunning, and the information contained within this source is titillating. Even though one might want more information, this book does a good job of giving the reader a general overview of the age of dinosaurs. If you are an enthusiast on this subject, you will definitely not want to miss out on this little gem.	2001-08-24

This book is a wonderful spoof on the whole concept of the evil Dark Lord versus the good guys.  I believe people of most ages would definitely enjoy reading this book.	2001-08-19

Everything about this series is awesome; the main character is very memorable as we watch her grow from a sheepfarmer's daughter into a paladin of the gods.  I actually felt disheartened whenever something bad would happen to Paks (books usually don't make me feel this way).  The main character is very well developed, and it is easy to become too attached to her.  One of the best parts of the series is the detail and grim reality that is given to military life; you do not find many books out there in this genre that give you a normal soldier's view of things.  This is probably not a popular opinion, but I actually liked this series better than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.  I could go on and on about this book (as everything about it is so well done), but I'll just say one more thing:  I would recommend &quot;The Deed of Paksenarrion&quot; to anyone who is a fan of great storytelling.	2001-07-27

Relics &amp; Rituals&quot; has some good stuff contained within its covers, but most of it is mediocre at best.  I thought the majority of the spells were rather uninteresting (including the flavor text) and could use a little bit more work on them; also, it seems like a great many of the spells are for both arcane and divine spellcasters (personally, I prefer that each type of casters have a somewhat unique spell list).  Enough about the spells, let's talk about the prestige classes... then again, let's not (somewhat interesting, but grossly over powered).  Magic items? (see comment about prestige classes)  The most interesting part of this book is ritual and tattoo magic; I'm actually implement this part into my campaign world.  All in all, &quot;Relics &amp; Rituals&quot; is an ok source book.  If you want more magic, you should definitely buy this book; if not, you can safely pass on this one.	2001-07-27

What happened after this?  A whole heck of a lot of chaos and humor; this book had me laughing from beginning to end.  You just gotta love it with the orcs teaching elves to be Marines, and cannibalistic halflings running around causing havoc.  This is a great book, which I have read over and over.  \\"Grunts\\" is not your standard fantasy, but it is a whole lot of fun.	2001-07-19

Personally, I do not see how anyone could say O.J. was not guilty after reading this book; there is just so much evidence stacked against him.  Mark Fuhrman was treated unfairly in the trial and by the media; in my opinion, he was just trying to do his job.  Read this book if you want to find out the truth concerning the O.J. case; I am really astounded that this man was not found guilty of murder.	2001-07-19

Mr. McCourt's writing style is at times humorous and often times witty.  I find it refreshing that he could write about some of the less fortunate choices he has made in life (many people don't even like to admit that they make mistakes); what this does show is that the author is merely human and not some idealized version of himself.  All though I find some of the author's choices in life disheartening, this book is definitely worth a read.	2001-07-16

There are enough creatures (about 500) in this book to make any DM happy.  The new format is easy to use and understand.  My favorite section was the part on templates; this is probably the best idea to come out of 3E D&amp;D.  All the creatures are non-campaign specific with the possible exception of one or two entries.  For the most part, the artwork in this book is very good with a few rather silly looking pictures.  The only thing that I find disappointing is the lack of history on each monster (those of you who have played 2E AD&amp;D know what I am talking about); I really enjoyed the wealth of information that earlier AD&amp;D monster entries provided.  All in all, this is a must have for any player of 3E D&amp;D.	2001-07-13

For the most part, this book is well written, and the artwork is very good except for a few rare cases.  Most of the creatures are well balanced (in my opinion anyway), and of course there are the critters which make you wonder why did they put that in here.  I definitely like the amount of detail and information they give for each monster (this is something I miss from 2nd edition AD&amp;D).  This book would be an excellent addition to any game master or person adventuring in the Scarred Lands.	2001-07-13

I thought \\"Into the Darkness\\" was a very well thought out and executed story.  This book roughly parallels WW2 where magic holds sway instead of technology.  Many different characters take center stage as the story is told from their point of view; this added a lot to the plot and helped move the story line along.  No longer is each side in the war just the good guys or bad guys; now each side is populated with real people that the reader can identify or empathize with.  Harry Turtledove wove a masterful tale in \\"Into the Darkness\\", and I definitely recommend this book to any and everyone.	2001-07-07

Unfortunately... the momentum of the book had just about completely stopped when I got about half way through.  I found the last half of the book rather uninteresting; it was a real chore for to get to the last page.  When I finally did finish \\"Rhapsody\\", I was left with a vaguely disappointed feeling.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I guess I just found the end of the book rather generic.  Because the book started so strongly and the writing style was well developed, I may give another of this author's books a chance.	2001-07-07

The draconians live in a world where they are pretty much hated by everyone, and the only thing these particular draconians want is a place of their own so they can live in peace.  Unfortunately, someone is out to completely destroy all draconians, and it is up to Kang and his men to prevent that.  \\"Draconian Measures\\" also introduces us to the female draconians whom Kang feels the need to protect at all costs. The females want to experience the world, but they have not been able to do that under the watchful eye of the commander.  This book is full of action and sure to please any fan of the Dragonlance world.  One thing that any D&amp;D fans should note is that the statistics for the draconians are listed in the back of the book.	2001-07-06

This book is very well researched and put together.  Locations to take your dog are easy to find because the book is split into sections for each county in California.  The book lists places you can stay and restaurants that are dog friendly; I even discovered a few places I didn't even know about that were close to my home.  One very valuable thing this books does is to tell you the parks and open areas that allow dogs to run without a leash or if you'll need to keep your pet on the leash.  This is a great book for all dog lovers in California!	2001-07-01

The characters are rather two dimensional, and not once during the entire story could I bring myself to care about what happened to any of the characters.  I've heard a lot of praise for books written by Arthur C. Clarke, so I tried to like \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\".

Personally I did like the book, but I feel the author did not reinforce his points enough or give enough examples.  Many people have written about this same subject, and I do not think this book has anything remarkable to recommend itself.

The story was very well developed and thought out.  I loved the way the author integrates the characters into the progression of history.  Even though the book jumps from time period to time period, each incarnation of the characters leaves off where the previous incarnation stopped; this created one continuous story line with the more or less same basic characters.  The characters were very likeable and well rounded, and the story is just excellent.  I would recommend this book to everyone even if they are not fans of the genre.	2001-06-29

I very much liked the details and bits of history that were given in each entry.  Unfortunately this book does suffer from two flaws.  Many of the illustrations in the book were just plain bad; they were just poorly done.  The other thing I did not like about this book was the fact that many of the creatures were ludicrous and not really useful outside of the campaign setting without a lot of changes.

The writing, in my opinion, was a little of the bland side for this author, and the characters could have used just a little bit more rounding out.  I think the author did a decent job with this book despite the two minor short falls I mentioned above.	2001-06-29

The characters in the story are rather bland and two dimensional; it is really hard to care either way as to what happens to each person.  I do not feel that much thought was given to the plot in that it is fairly straight forward and very much predictable.  Despite these short comings, the few humorous situations and quips were enough to hold me till the end of the book.	2001-06-29
