I was first introduced to Ana Castillo, when I read her marvelous novel, \\"So Far From God\\" (\\"Tan Lejos de Dios\\"), which was a journey through magical realism, Chicana identity and the experience of people who have lived and cultivated the land as far back as ten generations.  This was a true example of the indigenous experience in the United States.  Totally beautiful and powerful......<br /><br />\\"My Father Was a Toltec\\" doesn't fail to disappoint.  This collection of poems looks at the Chicana/indigenous Mexican/female experience in the United States, and in Mexican culture.  Ana writes in English, Spanish, Spanglish and sprinkles it with words in Toltec (the culture of her father).  Castillo, an avid writer and practicioner of santeria (a mixture of the Catholic and indigenous ritualistic beliefs), truly has a connection to this duel (even triple) identity.  Castillo grew up in a Mexican neighborhood, in the South side of Chicago, and finally took a trip with her mother to their native Mexico, when she was older (this is captured in her poetry).<br /><br />I definitely reccomend this book.  Ana Castillo is an auther more readers should know about!!  This is such an important example of Latina literature.  Those from the culture will identify with her, and those non-Latinos and non-Spanish speakers will definitely receive an education.	2005-10-03

I am so lucky that I had the great pleasure to read this masterful piece of literature, \\"When I Was Puerto Rican,\\" written by the great Esmeralda Santiago.  Ms. Santiago captures the feelings, thoughts and form of expression of a young girl, coming from a modest (poor) background in Puerto Rico, with her resilient, courageous mother and her often-absent father.<br /><br />Santiago was one of several children, growing up in what she describes as \\"the jungle,\\" while her father went out to find work, doing odd jobs in the city, leaving behind her mother, younger brothers and sisters, and modest home.  Esmeralda (or Nega, short for \\"La Negrita,\\" an affectionate nickname, in reference to her dark skin and features) excels in school, helps raise her siblings, and learns about love, life and loss, while in her native island (or \\"La Isla Del Encanto\\"--Enchanted Island).  Her family is eventually uprooted, by her mother, and the children must adjust to the new customs of New York.<br /><br />This book is written with warmth, tenderness, thoughtfulness and sensitivity.  I am sure Esmeralda Santiago has touched many young Latinos, out there, and I am a new fan of hers, for sure.  I look forward to reading more of her books, to come.<br /><br />Gracias para compartido su gran regalo con nosotros, Sra. Santiago.  Es un honor.....

This is a beautiful collection of short stories from some of the most well-known and well-respected Latina writers, writing today, as well as some authors who are just emerging today.<br /><br />Some of these writers include Julia Alvarez (\\"Snow\\"), Sandra Cisneros (\\"Only Daughter\\"), and Ana Castillo (\\"My Mother's Mexico\\").<br /><br />This is a wonderful introduction to the jewel trove of talent present in the Latina community exclusively. We hear about universal plights, ups and downs, comedies and tragedies that are truly universal.  Also, we hear the stories of the daughters of immigrants to this country, as well the experiences of women whose families have in the United States for many generations (those who were cultivating the earth, ten generations back, before the United States was even the nation that is today).  I highly reccomend that you read this collection of stories, for your education, as well as for your awareness.  It is inclusive toward all readers.

We learn about how it was considered a subversive (and even deadly) artistic form for women.  This was just as controversial as removing your veil (or hajab), for men to get a glimpse at your beauty.  Women writing was synonymous with promiscuity and corruption.  We are so lucky that Dr. Farzanah Milani introduces us to some of the poems (and poets) that brought this revolution to the forefront of Persian culture.	2005-09-27

It just keeps getting better and better, for me, when it comes to reading the great Julia Alvarez's novels and short stories.  It is truly not impossible to be moved by her powerful subject matter, engaging character development and stirring juxtaposition of factual points in the history of the Dominican Republic, with fictional elaboration.<br /><br />\\"Before We Were Free\\" takes a tiny glimpse into the world of Anite del Torre, a 12 year old Dominican girl, whose father is involved in the uprising against President Trujillo's oppressive, violent and iron handed dictatorship over the country for over thirty years.  It was the year's 1960 and 1961 who were, perhaps, two of the most pivotal in the Caribbean nation's history, when an organization was formed to overthrow the Trujillo government, and, ultimately assasinate the cruel dictator.  Anita's father is part of this group.  It is her father's decision to do this that puts his family in a very dangerous position, that drives Anita and her mother into hiding in a neighbor's closet.  As they seek refuge from the dictatorship's police forces, seeking out anyone involved in the assasination.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this novel.  Though, it is targetted for a young audience, this is engaging writing, good for readers of all ages.	2005-09-16

I am happy to say that \\"The Dirty Girls Social Club\\" was an entertaining, intelligent, poignant and compelling page turner.  Valdes-Rodriguez really dignified and acknowledged the different faces and experiences of Latinas in the United States.  Not all of us are olive-skinned, with black hair, black eyes and accents (like the media tells the rest of the world).  We comes in all colors, shapes and from different backgrounds.<br /><br />This book introduces us to Lauren, a half Cuban (on her father's side) columnist for the local paper, Sara, a Jewish Cubana, a mother of two with a dark secret, Amber, a Mexican-American, recently reconnecting with her roots, Elizabeth, a black Colombiana who isn't telling the truth about her love life, Rebecca, a Mexican American founder of a Latina-themed magazine, and Usnavys, a Dominicana with expensive tastes.<br /><br />These six women all met during college, and stuck together ever since.  They call themselves \\"Las Sucias\\" (The Dirty Girls) and meet up, regularly, to offer one another support and encouragement.  What works so well, in this book, is the realistic, unabashed look at day-to-day life through the eyes of women in their late twenties.  Although, their Latin roots are acknowledged in the novel, there is a universal quality to their adventures (and misadventures) and is appealing, regardless of your ethnicity, as a reader.<br /><br />I, for one, am really happy to see such a touching book, out there, that talks about the contemporary experiences of women, and the different faces of Latina identity.  I, for one, wasn't exposed to my father's culture at all (he is from Venezuela), and didn't fit the idea people have in their heads about how Latin women are.  How great that Valdes-Rodriguez presents that duel identity here.  I highly reccomend it.....	2005-09-05

This was one of the books I assigned as \\"summer reading\\" to myself, a year ago.  I am so glad I did it.  Francisco Goldman juxtaposes magical realism, humor, human tragedy and sexuality into one amazing epic of a novel.  I was first introduced to him when I read \\"Half and Half,\\" a book filled with accounts of bicultural and biracial writers, recalling their experiences growing up in two factioned worlds in society. For Goldman, it was the Jewish world of his father, and the Guatemalan world of his mother.  He transposes his experiences loosely, in the perspective of Rogerio, the main character and (sometimes) narrator of \\"The Long Night of White Chickens.\\"<br /><br />Rogerio is biracial/bicultural young man, plagued by illness, as a young boy, and living between the middle class world of his Jewish father, and the village life of his Guatemalan mother.  It is through a remarkable twist of fate that he comes to know Flor, the beautiful heroine of the book, who is his nanny/companion, throughout his childhood and into adulthood.  Flor haunts many people with her memory, after a horrendous tragedy that leaves all she touched stricken by sadness.<br /><br />This book is really hard to describe, but hopefully my little review encourages you to check it out!!!!	2005-08-09

(translation of title:  Very excellent for everyone who wants to learn the language!)<br /><br />I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial the Destinos: An Introduction to Spanish series is for those who want to learn Spanish, or become more familiar with the language. This was used in a course I took at college, and it felt like we were all travelling along with the main character, Raquel, a lawyer who travels from her home in Los Angeles, to Mexico, Spain, Argentina and Puerto Rico, as part of her work with her clients, a family living in an estate in Mexico City.<br /><br />The format of this program is styled after the Latin American \\"novelas\\" (soap operas).  In other words, you will need to carefully watch each episode, to keep up with plot details.  But, not to worry, because Raquel reviews what happened with you, at the end of every episode.  Each episode is entirely in Spanish, and it gets you thinking in the language, comprehending what is going on very quickly, as well as picking up interesting information specific to the cultures she is immersed in, during her travels.  We learn about art, music, dance, food and slang.  (Slang is also a very valuable thing to know about, when travelling in Spanish-speaking countries.  Words that are acceptable in one country could get you shot in another country---this isn't addressed in the episodes, but that is really important to be aware of)<br /><br />I am pleased to say that the series is entertaining, educational and very beneficial to students.  It makes you WANT to learn, and also, in spite of the melodrama, you will want to stick it out to the last episode to see how things turn out.  Muy excelente!	2005-08-04

I am a great fan of Julia Alvarez's writing, and am also greatly appreciative of her strength of character as an inspirational Latina writer.  Many of you may be familiar with her books \\"In the Time of Butterflies\\" and \\"How the Garcia Girls Lost their Accents.\\"  In this book, we get a better sense of Julia Alvarez, the woman, the writer, the artist and (in her words) a \\"hyphenated American.\\"  (i.e, Dominican-American)  These twenty-four essays offer a glimpse into her life, and what inspired her to persue writing.  Alvarez had a lot of great material from her childhood, growing up the daughter of a revolutionary who was part of the opposition against Trujillo, the former dictator of the Dominican Republic.  Julia also possessed a great wit and imagination, throughout her academic and personal life.<br /><br />We are so honored that this great woman decided to convey her thoughts and stories through writing.  This is definitely her true talent.  What a true inspiration for all aspiring writers (Latina and otherwise).  This book is engaging, warmly accessible and insightful.  Highly reccomended!	2005-07-24

This is yet another great example of when Bollywood films have the power to penetrate our hearts, open our minds and linger in our souls.  Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (Straight From the Heart--English translation) features beautiful, colorful and luscious cinematography, attractive and well-cast leading actors, melodious and soulful music, energetic dance numbers and a great combination of humor, high drama and romance.<br /><br />Nandini (Aishwarya Rai) is the beautiful daughter of the singer, Pandit Darbar (Vikram Gokhale), who takes on a music pupil in Sameer (Salman Khan), a half-Italian/half-Indian young man who travels all the way from Italy to learn singing.  Nandini falls in love with him, straight away.  The conflict is that Vanraj (Ajay Devgan), a young lawyer, has sent a proposal to Pandit, requesting his daughter's hand in marriage.  Once the two lovers are caught together, Pandit demands that Sameer leave and forget his daughter.  The selfless and faithful Vanraj comes to know his wife, Nandini's love for Sameer, and promptly decides to reunite the two in Italy, even though he is very much in love with her.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story about coming to learn the importance of respect and faith in a relationship, and how even the biggest tests can actually bring people together, overtime.  Nandini must decide whether to follow her heart or her soul, when she is torn between the undying love of her husband or her love for Sam.<br /><br />Great movie!  Don't miss it.

It was contrived, stereotypical and sappy.  Though, the plot idea was intriguing--a seven year old Indian girl is married off to her best friend, is then separated from her groom, her mother is brutally beaten and she ends up adopted by a white, America couple--it didn't hold together.<br /><br />One of the biggest flaws in the book was the stereotypical depiction of the characters.  The worst is of Carlos, the main character, Meena's, good friend.  Though he is from Mexico, he teaches her samba (from Brazil), Kirchner misspells his hometown of Oaxaca (she spells it Oxaca).  He is macho and womanizing, and seemingly mindless.  Also, Bharti's writing style seems half-baked and almost condescending to her readers.  Kirchner ties up the complications a little too readily and unbelievably.<br /><br />If you would like to read a far superior novel by Kirchner, my reccomendation is that you read \\"Sharmila's Book,\\" which is also about a young Indian woman's bicultural sense of self.  Far more interesting, compelling and well written!	2004-12-03

After reading \\"A Poet in New York,\\" I can say this much:<br /><br />\\"I don't think I am planning a trip to New York very soon.\\"  Lorca's account of the city was so visceral, raw and cruel, I could feel the hauntingly dead interactions between people, and those people's relationships to the material world around them.  The accounts of violence in the streets are equally as cold and boldly unapologetic as his observations of the early morning hours when the city is first waking up.<br /><br />Gabriel Garcia Lorca truly shows that when it comes to the movements as a city with ties to industry, capitalistic gain and material wealth, there is no division between the life of the human being and the life of the machine.  There is almost an automated, \\"conveyor belt\\" feeling to the mechanical movement of life in the city.  As soon as energy is poured into an endeavor, it is also poured out just as easily.  People are as disposable as sheet metal.  Their blood, their organs and their instruments of movement could be ripped away and demolished as quickly and non-emotionally as one would destroy the framework of a building and it would be of no concern to anyone else.<br /><br />I believe that Lorca's observations and journal entries are a reflection of not only the mindset of one of the most well known cities in the world, applicable to the 1930s, but is also quite accurately a reflection of the state of the world today.	2004-11-26

Forget about the descriptions of pastries in this book!  What about the sumptuous, unforgettable descriptions about the tempting cheesecake slices that keep finding their way in the pages of this food novel?  I could almost see the ripe slices of mango, the delicate texture of the crumb crust, and the wickedly caloric and irresistable cheesecake core.  Ay, I am sure anyone who is on any kind of calorie-restrictive diet will really feel their willpower being challenged if they are able to get through this book without succumbing to cravings for pies, cookies, lemon bars and other assorted concoctions that the main character talks about in rich detail, omitting nothing.<br /><br />This is the third of Bharti Kirchner's novels that I have read.  I really admire her for the way she develops her characters through their both endearing and annoying personal habits, as well as the generous descriptions of their tastes in clothing, cologne and food.  We really get a sense of the individuals described, and by the time I finished reading the book I felt as though I had known some of the main people personally and had even shared a slice of cheesecake with them!<br /><br />Sunya, the main character, is a forlorn, embitterred, Indian-American whose bitterness is quite heavy for a woman of only twenty-nine years.  She never knew her father, who abandoned her and her mother.  Her parents both immigrated from India, a product of an arranged marriage back home, and her father, a chemistry professor, found work in Seattle at the University of Washington.  Sunya's inspiration for cooking came from her mother.  As a young woman, her mother, Dee, managed to pay the bills and maintain their family household income through her ownership and management of a small \\"mom and pop\\" donut shop.  She combined the familiarity and accessiblity of an American staple (the donut) and infused it with her own Indian sensiblities (exotic flavors like lime) to make it authentically her own.  Sunya's gift as baker has been clouded by her sadness over a broken relationship and unresolved issues around her father and her lifelong feeling of rejection.<br /><br />Bharti's telling of this story of self discovery, forgiveness, resilience and pastries (hence, the title) is beautifully told through the eyes of a young woman whose story isn't restrictive exclusively to her culture or gender, for that matter.  There are many people out there whose parents have rejected family life to seek out their own path, while leaving child and remaining parent behind in the dust.  I, too, am one of those people.

I have been an avid lover of Neruda's work for ten years now.  The first book of collected works I read by the glorious exhiled poet from Chile was \\"5 Decades,\\" which I polished off in 48 hours.  I was a twelve year old Neruda fiend from then on.<br /><br />\\"100 Love Sonnets\\" does not fail to disappoint.  What you have to keep in mind when you read this bilingual collection is not the strength or weakness of the English interpretation, but your own interpretation of the original Spanish.  It is probably best that you read this with Spanish/English dictionary in hand.  Not only will you be able to get a sense of the literal translation, but if you aren't a native speaker, will also learn considerable Spanish vocabulary.  I would agree with some of the reviewers that the interpretation does fall short.  There really is no beating the original Spanish text.  There are even simple mistakes made on basis verb tense.  Example:  \\"Vendras conmigo\\" dije--sin que nadie supiera donde y como latia mi estado doloroso.....<br /><br />Stephen Tapscott says, \\"Come with me,\\" I sai, and no one knew where, or how my pain throbbed.....<br /><br />Actually, literal translation would be, \\"You will come with me,\\" I said--without anyone knowing when and how painful and throbbing was my state....<br /><br />Quite different, no?  Well, at any rate, these poems are worth knowing on intimate level for any lover of literature--Latin American or otherwise.  I only hope Neruda can forgive Mr. Tapscott his ignorance of one of the most beautiful romance languages and the significance of the powerful and seductive words the masterful poet chose to describe the affairs of the heart that are at once universal, affirmative and, at times, desperate.....Though the metaphors are watered down in this interpretation, with a good bilingual dictionary and some patience, you can get a sense for yourself of the grand power of his words.	2004-10-29

It was entitled \\"Locating Ourselves.\\"  What an appropriate title!  This book definitely fit right into that description.  \\"Coming of Age in Mississippi\\" is really the story of one brave, ambitious and dedicated young African-American woman's journey and experiences during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement.  Anne must overcome great adversity at a young age, growing up poor, female and Black in the rural South.  She makes a decision to dedicate herself to developing her mind, scholastically, and excels in school.  This woman's dedication to education keys into other aspects of her life and experiences.  Once Ms. Moody is exposed to some of the activism going on to encourage equal rights, as well as encouraging young African-Americans to register to vote, she jumps on board.  She becomes part of SNCC, an organization that is a leader in the outreach movement to encourage the Black vote.  Anne must come up against racism, sexism, threats and intense repercussions when she takes a stand for this kind of freedom of speech.  She participates through her speeches and recruitment effots.<br /><br />This book is truly an inspiration for people of any background.  It is an especially timely novel, at this time, when every human right is being challenged in society, as well as in our government.  Does our vote count for something?  You can be sure it does.  Don't ever take it for granted.  We have to thank Anne Moody and people like her who worked to ensure that all people are given equal rights and equal say in important issues applicable to humanity.	2004-10-27

Although I think that what Professor Trask has to say definitely has validity and is a very important history to learn about, I also sense as a mainland-born, non-Hawaiian female, that her visceral anger and pain burn virtually all of the non-Hawaiian readers in her path.  Hanauni-Kay Trask presents the bleak reality of Hawaii's history with colonizers, assorted oppressors, land developers and pollution and why it should not only be a sovereign, independent nation but that no one should come there looking for Don Ho and pina coladas, like the ad campaigns would have us believe.  In fact, Haunani informs us--without mincing words--that the Non-Hawaiian presence is not welcome in any of the Hawaiian islands.<br /><br />When I first digested her view of visitors to her Hawaii and the vast layers of corruption that have displaced her people, I shared her rage (even though I know she would never believe that, upon seeing me). Now, two years later, I really ask how she hoped to change the bleak situation through writing this book.  It seems to me, she practices the same racist ideology that the colonists practiced when they took over in the first place!  I know many would challenge my point and argue that she is merely taking back what is rightfully hers.  I think that venom breeds more venom, and, in turn, that venom poisons all of us.  (Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians)<br /><br />Whether many of us want to admit it or not, we are all connected on an inner level as human beings, brothers and sisters on this planet, who have all been hurt, abused, or deceived in some way.  This common bond also divides us.  We choose to resolve or confront this pain in different ways.  While some of us start wars, hold grudges with people who share the same eyes or skin color of our oppressors, and continue to be driven by our inherited anger from the generations or directly experienced discrimination; others come to accept that, regardless of race or national origin, each person on this earth is an individual.  Some individuals whose ancestry comes from the oppressor are actually working to overthrow this system of oppression in a sincere and humble manner.  It saddens me that Haunani cannot see that for herself and that her rage for the non-indigenous people continues with such force.  It might surprise Professor Trask to know that there are numerous groups of non-Indigenous people who have experienced the same level of oppression her ancestors (and she) have had to face.  Many of those on the receiving end of the violent genocides (the Holocaust, for example), bloody and ruthless revolutions (Russian as an example) and ethnic cleansings (the situation between Serbs and Croats) did not flee their countries to impose oppression on others.  They came seeking sanctuary and an opportunity to culture peace and justice around them.  I hope Haunani Kay-Trask will realize that we all really ARE struggling together.vidual.

These are illegal decibel levels that drive those within hearing range to points of mental instability, as well as potential hearing loss.<br /><br />One of the most important quotes from this book that I remember (since I read this book a couple of years ago in a Native/African-American Women's Studies course) was from a Seminole leader who said, \\"Selling your land for a price is like selling a piece of your mother.\\"  [I paraphrase this.]  I couldn't agree more.  When I remember that quote, I think about all of the animals, vegetation and tribes (consisting of families and friends) who have lived off of the land of the United States, as well as Canada.  How can one possibly put a price on something that can't truly be owned by anyone and is its own autonomous entity.  Even if people have the illusion that they can occupy land as territory (because of treaties, as an example) does not mean that it is ever their to keep.  LaDuke makes several strong examples of this in the book.  We can't continue to pollute, abuse and neglect land without paying a price environmentally or in terms of human quality of life and mortaiity.  I believe everyone should read this book, regardless of occupation, national origin or territorial location.  We need to face the damage done before more of it goes unacknowledged.  Thank you, Winonah.	2004-10-27

I think it is more than fair to say the Sherman Alexie has succeeded in writing one of the greatest contemporary Urban Aboriginal mystery/murder novels on the bookshelves today.  Mr. Alexie has a great talent for challenging all the lies we have accepted as reality in the \\"Indigenous experience\\" and knocks us over with his own vision of the hardships and pain of contemporary Native life with a twist of Stephen King thrown into the mix.<br /><br />John Smith is a young aboriginal man who was raised by White adoptive parents and has no knowledge of his tribe or any other specifics tied to his heritage.  John is in the depths of a traumatic identity crisis that spirals into mental illness and psychotic, murderous episodes.  His goal is to avenge the death and misery of every Indigenous person by systematically stalking and then murdering affluent Caucasian men.  This series of killings becomes the hot topic of Seattle as more and more race-related fights take place between White and Native residents.<br /><br />This is such an important novel and I am so glad that Sherman Alexie wrote it.  I felt as though we, as the readers, were taking a glimpse inside the many facets of his writer's mind and all of the depths of his personality as a storyteller.  It is a cautionary tale of what happens when someone is so far removed from themselves (example being John Smith) that they are driven to the depths of despair, due to their isolation and lack of confidence.  I once took a course with Sherman Alexie at the University of Washington where he stated that living on the Rez (where many indigenous people still reside in North America) is like living in an Edith Warton novel.  Authenticity is measured to the most minute degree.  Everything from your behavior to the pigment of your skin is considered a potential flaw. from which you can fall from grace at any given moment.  Imagine growing up a young indigenous man, surrounded by loving, adoptive parents who know nothing of your specific tribe, but are greatly divided from you by their race and their ignorance.  Instead of being taught about your specific tribal practices, you are bombarded with information about every tribe (as if that would make up for your lack of self awareness).<br /><br />Though this is definitely a murder mystery novel, Sherman Alexie manages to balance horror scenes with humorous bits, as well as intellectual criticism on the state of contemporary race relations and really forces us to examine our own stereotypes and prejudices.  Great book and definitely a fast read!e, but are greatly divided from you by their race and their ignorance.

My introduction to Julia Alvarez's work was her brilliant, humorous and poignant book, \\"How the Garcia Girls Lost their Accents.\\"  \\"In the Time of the Butterflies\\" is just as compelling and gives new insight into 1950s and 1960s politics and oppression in the Dominican Republic.<br /><br />Alvarez's novel is based on the life stories of four sisters--Dede, Patria, Maria Teresa and Minerva. Three of these sisters were nicknamed \\"Las Mariposas\\" (Patria, Maria Teresa and Minerva).  They were central in the uprising against the corrupt and oppressive dictatorship of President Trujillo.  The beautiful, dynamic and resilient women endured imprisonment and torture in exchange for their tireless efforts to take a stand against the tapping of wires, supression of expression amongst citizens of the Dominican Republic and general scare tactics enforced by a political regime.  These women ended up being killed at the hands of Trujillo's henchmen.  Dede, the one sister who didn't get involved in political movements as heavily as her siblings, is the subject of many interviews and much interest expressed by visitors and fellow countrymen and women, alive after the assassination of President Trujillo.<br /><br />What sets \\"In the Time of Butterflies\\" apart from other novels about social and political movements and the great people who participated in them is Julia Alvarez's sensitive, warm and touching style of interweaving the stories of the four women.  Alvarez is actually a product of a Dominican family, herself, that escaped the Trujillo regime when the immigrated to the United States.  Her father was actively involved in the coup to remove the violent, arrogant and lecherous Trujillo from power.  Ms. Alvarez's personal knowledge of the fear and turmoil experienced by Dominican people at the hands of their oppressive government added to the believablity of this fictionalized account of three beautiful women we all ought to know more about.<br /><br />Please read this book!  I believe all high schools should add this to their reading list.  We all should have some exposure to Latin American literature--the earlier in life, the better.book!

It was as though I was experiencing a beautiful film.  I could see the sights, smell and taste the Indian food the title character consumes and felt the delicate fabrics from which the saris come from.  Kirchner's style is whimsical, heartfelt and cuts like a knife.<br /><br />\\"Sharmila's Book\\" is an intimate and brutally honest account of one Indian-American women's journey to India to meet with her potential husband--this is through an arranged marriage organized by her parents.  Though, Sharmila was born and raised in Chicago, fully immersed in American culture, she retains strong ties to traditional Indian respectablity, culinary preparation and her image and duty as a young and well-educated woman.  What she discovers about the arrangement is all that glitters is not gold.  Her intended, Raj, is tall, handsome, athletic and has seemingly all the breaks (MBA from a prestigious United States university, a prestigious position in the Indian caste system, and considerable material wealth), but something just isn't right about him.  She can't put her finger on what........<br /><br />Sharmila's trip to India turns out to be more than what she planned for.  It turns out that the central reason for her travels is only secondary to her personal journey within as a woman and someone struggling with a dual cultural identity.  Her story is also truly empowering for any woman of any culture who reads the novel.  Sharmila learns about self respect, as well as taking the road less travelled when persuing true happiness in life.<br /><br />Please reccomend this book to anyone who wants to get a better sense of the dual identity struggle that exists for American-born people of ethnic Indian origin.  Very compelling!!!	2004-10-09

Bharti Kirchner, a locally-based writer in my hometown of Seattle, has written several novels where food and culture go hand in hand.  I first was introduced to Ms. Kirchner and her writing at a multicultural literary exposition.  She read a passage from \\"Pastries,\\" another novel where food is an important part of the relationship between people and also a metaphor for their interactions.<br /><br /> I happened to spot \\"Darjeeling\\" on the book shelf at the library and was intrigued by the tea business in India and how it connects and divides a prosperous family involved in the cultivation of tea and the upkeep of the land from which it  is produced.  The patriarch, Mr. Gupta, has two daughters.  The eldest daughter, Aloka, is beautiful, vivacious and seemingly has all of the breaks.  The younger daughter, Sujata, is plainer, less social and the black sheep of the family. A twist of fate divides the two sisters when a young man, Pranab, comes between them.  The arrogant and hard-headed young man wants to overthrow the power weilded by their father over the numerous workers he presides over.  Pranab feels Mr. Gupta is exploiting them and not adequetly taking care of their basic living needs (healthcare, fair wage, etc).  While Pranab is in love with Sujata and charmed by her brilliant mind, he is expected to be married to Aloka, the older, more well-respected daughter.  Still, he embarks on a love affair with Sujata during their engagement.  This is a scandal that divides and alienates the women from each other as Aloka agrees to go along with the marriage in spite of Pranab's poor character.<br /><br />At first it was hard for me to grow accustomed to Kirchner's systematic writing style.  At times, I felt I was reading an instruction manual.  (Kirchner was a computer engineer for many years, prior to becoming a writer.)  The second half of the book grew on me as I, as the reader, observed a transformation in both women who must rise above the patriarchical and misogynistic culture they have been raised in.  Aloka was raised as the \\"good Hindu wife.\\"  This meant she wasn't to question her husband regarding any of his extra-marital affairs or his coldness.  Sujata also undergoes a tremendous transformation and gains great self worth through great adversity and self discovery through life's hardships.misogynistic culture they have been raised in.

This is one of the strongest, wittiest, most provocative and thought provoking novels I have ever read.  It confirmed for me, even more, why I love, admire and have so much respect for Sherman Alexie as a writer and as a man,  He portrays the universal human struggle with such gritty realism and unabashed honesty.  It doesn't hurt that he also blends a dose of magical realism and wimsy into the mix.<br /><br />This book introduces the endearing partnership of Victor Joseph, Thomas-Builds-the-Fire and Junior Polatkin to Alexie's reading audience.  These are the same young man who continue their journey in \\"Tonto and Lone Ranger Fist Fight in Heaven\\" (a brilliant collection of his short stories that blend humor with pathos).  We get to know the angry and broken Victor, the delightfully nerdy and off beat storyteller, Thomas and the unstable Junior as they form a band with the help of legendary bluesman, Robert Johnson.  Johnson leaves a guitar in Thomas' van and the rest is history.<br /><br />Perhaps, one ot the strongest qualties in this book is its universal accessiblity.  We all laugh, cry and hurt together regardless of color, ethnicity, age or gender.  These three young men (who happen to be Spokane Indian) are engaging, tender and richly illustrated.  All of the supporting characters equally hold your attention as the reader.<br /><br />The music in this novel permeates your brain and you can hear and feel the melody........You will never listen to blues (or native chants) the same way.	2004-09-26

It was one of the several phenomenal books we were required to study during the course of the quarter.  I felt so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to read these important words from the mouths and pens of a very underrepresented group in our nation:  African-American women.<br /><br />There are so many voices in this book, I don't want to begin to list them because I am sure I will leave someone of value out, but I will tell you that the articles written by Angela Davis, Sojourner Truth and Mrs. W.E.B Dubois are engaging and give you a new perspective on the \\"race movements\\" of the United States.  Oftentimes, on the road to \\"equal rights\\" women of color were completely left out of the picture, and were in fact expected to stay quiet and stand by their men for comfort and support.  This was at the expense of their own equality and hope for progress.<br /><br />This is a book that should be read by many, and at a younger age than college.  I feel our young people could really benefit from such valuable information and insight into the system of oppression that exists even within the African-American movements of the 1800s, 1900s and today.	2004-09-14

I found the short story so humorous, touching and sensitive I wanted to read the book that it originally came from.<br />What I admire about Julia Alvarez is her subtlety as a writer.  I found myself chuckling to myself throughout the book, as well as learning more about her experience as a Dominicana told through the eyes of the four fictionalized daughters and the parents who raised them in a time of great political unrest.  This was during the time of Trujillo, when their father got in trouble politically for attempting to overthrow his dictatorship.  Hence, the reason for their exile to the Bronx, and the circular visits taken by the daughters returning from their schools in the U.S. back to the Dominican Republic.<br />What I admire about this story (or series of short stories) that discuss and illustrate the challenge of assimilation, racism and identity, is that Julia Alvarez's characters are identifiable with anyone who had has to immigrate and assimilate to a new set of social expectations and assume a bicultural/biracial identity.  I think specifically of all the different Latinos from all corners who immigrated here, fleeing social and political unrest, and other groups of people of color who came to this country seeking a better life for themselves and their families.<br />I am also a great fan of Sandra Cisneros, the lively and biting Chicana writer based in Texas.  I have to say that to compare Alvarez's work to Cisneros is impossible because the styles are so different.  But, in all honesty, I found Alvarez less hard-edged and more accessible.  I highly reccomend this novel as an introduction to a wonderful, vibrant and insightful Latina writer.  I want to thank Julia Alvarez for sharing the experience of assimilation and adversity with us, her humble readers.	2004-06-29

Ana Castillo truly takes us for an unforgettable trip as we take a glimpse into the lives of Sofi, a Chicana woman, and her four daughters, Esperanza (Hope), Caridad (Charity), Fe (Faith), and La Loca (The Crazy One).  The story reads like an epic parable about life, death, sexuality and the bridge between the world of the living and the afterlife.  It also raises very important questions about the division between heaven and hell and whether is really such a bad place after all in comparison with the life that we come to accept.<br />Each woman in this story is touched by fate in unexpected, and (sometimes) supernatural ways.  While Esperanza, the successful, upwardly mobile sister acts on her name and is relocated to Iraq as part of her journalism work, her sister Caridad becomes a faith healer, Fe loses her voice after a fit of desperate screaming, and La Loca cheats death as a young toddler only to become the subject of social scrutiny in their community as an isolated loner with a sixth sense only understandable to her mother, Sofi.<br />This book is truly enjoyed when you suspend disbelief and just go with the supernatural and magical elements.  SO FAR FROM GOD is true poetry, and also very important in cultural studies.  It was assigned to me in a comparative literature class through the department of American Ethnic Studies with the following books:  The Grass Dancer, A Lesson Before Dying, Ruby Ridge, and Homebase.

I was assigned to read HOMEBASE by Rainsford Chan in a American Ethnic Studies comparative literature course and I was so glad that I did!  The author, Professor Wong, who was the head of the English department at the University of Washington, gives the Chinese Exclusion Act and the generations who followed it a face, a name and a story.  Rainsford Chan, the main character, bridges three generations as he takes a look back at his identity as a Chinese-American in an adverse culture that will not accept him as truly &quot;American&quot; because of his Eastern features, the color of his skin and his last name.  Though, his great-grandfather literally helped to build America, while constructing the Trans-Pacific railroad, Chan still feels he has no real place amongst the Whites who continue to question his authenticity.<br />Wong's style is intense, poetic and frank.  This novel also brings up very important and timely points about cultural and social identity, and the connection between men, their fathers and the legacy they carry on even three generations down the line.  Rainsford excels in American sports, earns a letterman jacket and must become the &quot;man&quot; in the family after his father dies, and also helps his mother in her flower shop.  The duties of manhood and caring for his family are part of his identity that he must live up to, as well as the pressure of justifying his &quot;American-ness&quot; to everyone who insists he must be from Hong Kong.  Even though he comes from the &quot;home where the buffalos roam.&quot;  Such an important book for anyone interested in cultural identity in the United States, and for those who are still struggling for fair treatment in a White world.	2004-06-10

The young people who were featured were sensitive and engaging writers, who gave us all a further sense of struggle with biracial/multiracial identity in this country.  For me, knowledge is power, and this book was definitely empowering. It de-emphasized statistics, faceless percentages that we read about in the newspaper and hear about on television that represent the increase in bicultural/multiracial people in this country.<br />I find it really sad that in a culture like the United States where we claim to be a \\"melting pot\\" we still haven't managed to get over who melts, and how they melt, as well as with which groups they mix with in the melting process.  Speaking as a culturally-diverse young woman, about to graduate from college, I think it is of invaluable importance that people feel good about their cultures, feel free to express them and be given the respect they deserve.  One point that was raised in WHAT ARE YOU? that I can definitely relate to is the scrutiny people experience when on the receiving end of other's judgments and prejudices.  I am Polish/Latina/Lebanese and I can't tell you how many times people have said, \\"You don't look (fill in the blank).\\"  The world has to realize people come in all shapes, sizes and colors, and the images projected on the boob tube, in the movies and in music are not a fair representation of all people. They are just a cross section of examples.  We need to be open to the diversity of all.  Then, maybe we can come to accept ourselves through accepting others.	2004-06-05

Chevalier and Sanchez-Bain did an excellent job discussing and deciphering the ancient humeral medicine beliefs connected with food and people in ancient Mexican belief--specifically the Nahuas.  Corn and other foods take on a whole new meaning in this account.  We learn what is considered hot and cold (according to temperature) and how some foods are beneficial to our bodies and generate heat or cold, while others generate excessive amounts of either temperature and can actually damage our own levels of warmth of coolness when consumed.  The book covers everything from cultivation and the important processes that must be carried out in insuring that the farmer raises a good crop, to the use of food as medicine in ritual, to the history of creation according to Popoluca belief.

When I saw the title, I knew I had to check out the book for myself.  Since I am a bicultural person (of Venezuelan and Polish descent) I could relate to his struggle.  A lot of people doubt you based on physical characteristics, surname and mannerisms when you come from a bicultural background.  The situation was the same for Mr. Johnson, a lawyer of English and Mexican background.  His last name, light complexion and elementary knowledge of Spanish hindered him in integrating into Mexican culture, while his non-Caucasian features separated him from his Anglo contemporaries.  He wrote sensitively about his experiences and enlightened us about his process of self-discovery (finally marrying a Mexicana, having children with her, giving them Spanish names, etc).  I reccomend this book to anyone who wants an education on the bicultural experience or has been through that process themselves.  I can't tell you how many times, to this day, people still deny me my Latin roots because I don't look like the caricatures they have in their heads about how all Hispanics/Latinos are supposed to look (Dark skin, black hair, black eyes), and I don't have a Spanish last name because I was raised by my mom (Martinez, Morales, Rodriguez, etc).  We have to get over our assumptions about people if we want the walls to come down in our thinking.  It is the only way toward liberation.	2004-06-05
