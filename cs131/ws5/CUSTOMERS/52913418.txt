Parody and satire remain, despite the best efforts of some, to be the cornerstone of intelligent free speech as well as   a badge of courage for those who choose to speak most loudly in difficult times. Not for the politically faint of heart, idiots or anyone who cannot bear to consider another individual's opinion. Al's writing unique style coupled with biting presentation serve up an excellent picture of the Right Wing media \\"stars\\" of the day. By kicking off with the statement that God told him to write this book, Al is unrelenting in his framing of the most modern of conservative lies from the 2000 election, the truth behind the latest war and on to the ranting and raving of Annie \\"Get Your Gun\\" Coulter and destroys their rhetoric with a novel idea - facts. If all you know about the Right is what you see on TV, be prepared for a surprise within these pages. Thankfully, Al Franken is sticking around and has taken to heart Plato's words - \\"Those who are too smart to engage in politics are punished by being governed by those who are dumber.\\"<BR>Thanks again Al	2003-08-28

This frank and somewhat painful story about a life still being lived was riveting and I finished it within one afternoon. I must confess, I had never been a Hillary fan over the past years, due to her press. I now admit to being guilty of not paying enough attention. Mea cupla, Senator. I was riveted in her story. As for her claim that she did not realize the truth of her husband's dalliances? Ask any woman who has ever been cheated on how long it took for the obvious to sink in. You'll notice the bulk of Hill's literary detractors seem to be men, looking for any avenue to tear apart this interesting and honest retelling of international events by the only woman who actually had to live through it. Chicks know how it is. You believe because you want to believe, until, as any good screenwriter knows, it becomes impossible to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; any longer.<BR>The early history of the Clinton partnership, their life together coupled with Hillary's rise to political power and personal wholeness is quite worth the cost of the book.<BR>&quot;Why did she write it?&quot; someone asked on cable news today. Easy answer. Because we have been feeding off it for the past ten years, I for one am interested in the other side of the Clinton story as opposed to those who just want to continue the bashing. <BR>Read it and give yourself a chance to know someone you may have overlooked and may very well grow to admire.<BR>She's a mother, a healing wife, and a US Senator, but when it is all said and done...she's just another chick walking the planet and trying to hang on.<BR>Brave job, Hillary.	2003-06-09

Neo-Dada? Mono-Ha? Sots Art? If you find yourself utterly confused by art terms, timelines, and general overall descriptions of art movements since the 1940's, Art Speak is a great book to have. Robert Atkins of Village Voice fame, has put together a dictionary/mini-encyclopedia of &quot;ideas, movements and buzzwords&quot; touching on everything of note that evolved in the art world from WWII through 1989. The books opens with a timeline 1945-1989 detailing and comparing (in capsulized form) major world and art events, giving the reader/student an idea of the corellation between history and how art evolves and intertwines with it. The remainder of the book is an alphabetical listing of art movements with descriptions and snazzy graphics. It isn't a huge text book with intensive essays and pages and pages of commentary on each style, but it is a great set of &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; for those trying to find a jumping off point to learn more about that slippery entity called art. I highly recommend it.	2001-09-01

I'm not sure but certainly I need to know something, if only so I don't look like an idiot in front of my school age son. I picked this one up as an addition to our growing reference library after standing and browsing through it in the book store. The information is easy to read and comprehend while not written as if the reader is a science dummy (whcih I am). From Classic Biology, Plant Reproduction and Evolution right through to The Genetic Code and Quantum Mechanics, there literally are 1001 things to read and learn about and the book is very handy as a side car to school science lessons from elementary through high school. It isn't anything I would sit down and read cover to cover, but is constantly used by students around the neighborhood and passed hand to hand by theose in need of homework help.	2001-09-01

As shocking today as it was the day it was published, &quot;Mandingo&quot; and the series of books face a new audience and a whole new world in the year 2001. They are full of sex and sin, horror, gruesome torture, injustice and human suffering. They may read like &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; and yet the reader has to take a breath and realize these fictionalized accounts of slave life cannot be far off from the truth. Don't allow yourself to fall into three of the usual traps, however. 1. These books were written and received as trashy novels of the higher variety, meaning amidst the sex and sin, there was a message to the story, one would have to be rather dim to miss it. Never are they presented as the complete historical works of the horrors of slavery. 2. These books may included the talk and theory of white supremacy, but neither is glorified nor are the books &quot;tools&quot; of the white man to keep the black man down. Written in the 70's, the books were penned to be exploitive, graphic/trashy bestellers and they were, Mandingo being one of the biggest sellers. They are exploitive, while interesting in many parts, sexually and violently graphic, and would never be published in this day and age. 3. They were written in a time prior to political correctness being attempted into every single piece of literature being written. Yes, Gentle Readers, there was such a time. More (or less) than a dissection of slavery and its origins, this book stands as a mirror into 1970's literature and what we read. No more, no less. For that reason alone, I give the book a 4.	2001-08-28

She's an exotic dancer. She's a grifter. And she is a full blown serial killer in this deep dark novel. Starr Bright a/k/a Sharon is now aging for a future on the jiggle circuit and her exhaustive search for someone who can take care of her leads her to building rage and eventual violence to sooth her feelings of hurt and disappointment she blames on a series of hapless lowlife paramours. Starr begins a journey to take her out of the seedy empty Vegas life to the sanctity of her twin sister Lily and Lily's family in New York while leaving Vegas in the grip of her bloody wake. Lily, the &quot;good&quot; side of Starr's mirror welcomes her sister with open arms but has no idea what Starr has in store for those she believes set her on the road to ruin. Nor does Lily full understand what her own personality could reveal. This book is one of my very favorites, each word has been chosen soley for its effect on the reader and the story ebbs and flows as naturally as the tide. I tore through it the first time. It left such an impression on me I have picked it up a second time, this time to read much more slowly so I can enjoy each detail.	2001-08-28

This is the second in the series for crime solvers Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews, the psychologist with a past and the scars to prove it, and retired-cop-turned-Mr.-Mom, Lou Boldt. A series of corpses begin to turn up sans some of their inner organs, Daphne begins to put two and two (or two and whatever is left) together. She manages to pull together enough clues to entice her old partner back into the hunt. The story itself if an interesting and novel idea. John Glover's frantic and frenetic read of the story and his unique audio interpretation of each character is riveting if a bit nerve racking as he never lets up and keeps the listener in a constant state of near hysteria. But even such a horror fan as this reviewer has grown to be over the years, this mystery was just a bit too gruesome for me and Pearson's characterization of a live harvesting vicitim was more than I could take. What happened to those plain old garden variety serial killers and psychos of mysteries gone by?<br />Leave it on the shelf unless you have a strong stomach.	2001-08-28

I remember sneaking the paperback from my grandmother's nightstand and running down to the beach to read and revel while she was out shopping. Valley works just as well today as it did the day it was published. Shadow, sadly, doesn't. We follow our same characters out of the valley, but they never seem to evolve with time. A leopard, it is said, cannot change its spots, but it sure can learn a new way to go after its prey. This just was not written that way. Based on notes Jackie left behind upon her death, Lawrence sets out to complete the story of what happened to our girls. Neely O'Hara, entertainer and spoiled brat, is back looking for the respect she feels her due. Poor Anne Welles, once the high fashion model, is now a single mother and really poor, with no visible means of support until she launches a whole new career for herself. The men are there, acting just as horribly as they did almost three decades ago. And those beautiful &quot;dolls&quot; may have new prescription names, but the song remains the same. There is simply nothing new, just more of the old. I was and am a fan of Jackie's very special genre she slashed out of conventional literature for herself. I greatly anticipated this sequel to take me back to that special time when one could still be shocked and to see what happened to all of the characters who made up the number one best selling phenomena. I was disappointed, I did enjoy the snappy dialogue which was so close to Susann's writing as well as visiting &quot;old friends&quot; but it is only a must read if you read the first one and want to know how it all turned out. I can't help but wonder what changes may have occurred for the characters had the Queen nothave gone on to a bigger assignment.	2001-08-28

Dozens of false passports, rope and bloody trunks, tranquilizers and needles, and more than a few unpaid Cadillacs, this story is all the more shocking when one realizes this spree serves as a crash course in grifting - taught by mother to son. &quot;Grifters&quot; author Adrian Havill tells us &quot;are the Einsteins of crime&quot; and yes indeed that seems to be the case. Sante Kimes. Overweight, over-confident, overly made up and over bearing, she is the fat femme fatale, the Patron Saint of The Grifters. Her life spent rolling from scam to scam, save a three year prison stint for conviction of keeping her housekeeping help as &quot;slaves&quot; - locked in her home and under her rigid punishment system, Kimes was once thought of as a beautiful woman on the cusp of business and society. Along with her Norman Bates-like son Kenny, she wreaked havoc and murder across the country culiminating in the New York disappearance of eccentric, bubbly millionaire Irene Silverman. This is simply an incredible story and the book opens with a wondefully informative introduction which details the differences between drifters, grifters, serial killers, mass murderers, spree killers et al and helps set the stage for the reader to truly try to understand what makes this sick woman and her jittery son/probable lover tick. Well worth reading for the aficiandos of true crime in it's most bizarre form.	2001-08-28

Books	1	12	16	N	N	RANT AND RAVE	If the Kennedys are indeed, driving you crazy, you will enjoy this book, although you may consider consulting a specialist to discover why one family that isn't your own is actually chipping away at your sanity. If you are looking for a partisan work, you will enjoy this book. And finally, if are you are interested in hearing any guy's opposing side to Camelot, this one will be a keeper for your library. If, however, you are more of a historical reader and interested in dissecting the Kennedy story and comparing notated facts to make your decision, this is not the book for you. True the author uses actual sources and notates his bibliography but if you delve into said footnotes and care enough to look them up, they read like a movie review. Say Rex Reed writes &quot;This film is the most fabulous flop...&quot; You will probably see that quote on the one sheet in the theatre lobby &quot;Rex Reed says this film is the most fabulous...&quot; The commentary about Ted Kennedy's record in Mass. is incomplete at best. But it is one long rant and rave and fans of rants may dig it. All in all, I think that while the Kennedys may be driving Mr. Parker crazy, most people will have more concrete reasons for their stand on La Familia Kennedy than this particular book.	2001-08-23

Although there are many &quot;classics&quot; assigned for literature readers of the same age in this new era, the world of teenage books truly screams out for stories that are more timely. I believe it is through literature teenagers can come to see other cultures, other lives, and other situations more than if we keep waving newspapers in front of their faces. Literature sings a new song, and if the song is well written, the mind can dance to it. Buried Onions is such a novel. My son was assigned it as summer reading and he was so absorbed in it, I decided to read it myself. It is timely. Soto brings the character of Eddie to life by revealing both his small rays of hope and his overpowering sense of hopelessness to the reader. The struggle he faces to remove himself from the violent gang environment and into vocational school and eventually a job. His best efforts fail due to outside influences and he must make a decision which will chart the course for the rest of his life. The ending of the book, revealed above in the canned review, I feel is deliberate, much like the ending of &quot;The Giver.&quot; The reader was pointedly forced into wondering what really happened after the book was closed. What a great hook to make someone think. Even more than Eddie's story, the ending opens up wonderful opportunities to discuss the story and the different avenues Eddie's life may have taken AFTER the conclusion in the book. It's a different age, a different time in history and while it's wonderful to revisit the classics, it is vital young people have the opportunity to delve into some of the very real issues all kids are facing. If your kid has this as an option on a reading list, encourage them to choose it. They (and you) will be engrossed and it's an excellent jumping off point to discuss life choices.	2001-08-22

I was genuinely saddened to read the review by Kirkus, to think it may turn away a potential reader from this  story which is indeed like walking through a Yankee rock garden barefoot. But the journey is one that is worth taking. Then, musing over the commentary, I realized the blurb had probably been written by a middle aged man from the South, and promptly discarded it. Women of Granite is the saga of a family of women, raised by women, and who manage to rise above the weakness of the men they themselves have chosen. It is not, as they say, for the squeamish. The character of Nana Page is engrossing, shocking, and finally endearing. It is from Nana that the next generations of women flow, learn, and evolve. It is also about how history does indeed  repeat itself, sometimes much to our horror. If a reader is interested in a harsh storm, then Women of Granite, like a Yankee February, is worth reading. I do hope others give this novel a chance and post their comments.	2001-08-22

I am not generally a Morgan Fairchild follower anyway, so I was doubtful. I went ahead and gave it a listen. No doubt readers at familiar with the big screen version of the book &quot;Single White Female&quot; which appears endlessly on cable stations and was quite good the first two or three times it played. The film followed the basic plotline of the novel but the two versions part company at approximately mid point and I found the audiobook thoroughly engrossing. Writer Lutz and reader Fairchild play Allie Jones as a much tougher, more aggressive woman and so the resulting weakening and final deterioration as her life is taken over by her strange flatmate is much more dramatic and horrifying. More than the film, the book has a Hitchockian texture to it as the body count (and the question as to Allie's guilt or innocence in those murders) is more intense. The basic differences I feel I can reveal without ruining this version for potential readers concern the detailed framing and subsequent arrest of Allie as well as greater involvement in the story of Graham the neighbor who hears more than he should while putting an ear to the duct work in the apartment above the SWFs. The last quarter of the book is a well-paced and exciting side  story excluded from the film. It's just a thriller, and a &quot;beach read&quot; at that but listening while driving home one night, I got plenty of goosebumps. And so will anyone else who ever had to live with a roommate they thought was hell.	2001-08-19

I don't enjoy the pain and suffering of others. I do appreciate and enjoy reading a book when the author, co-author, and participants feel so strongly about an incident they feel compelled to allow the public to peek through the curtain and understand or at least meet the players and learn about the background of such stories. And, in the case of authors like Dominick Dunne, who continue to name the name of his daughter's killer, it keeps the memory of the victims alive and their executioners in the public eye. This was one of those books for me. This was not due to the writing style, which I felt could have been tighter. More of my interest was held by the detailing of the lives of the victims and the people the murders touched. It had to be incredibly painful for the co-author, aunt of one of the victims, to put forth such detail and honesty regarding the time that led up to the murder. Boczkowski was and is a detached psychopath who executed two wives with less thought than it took to choose the colors of tile in his hot tub. His victims were his first wife, Elaine, the mother of his children, and then his second wife Maryann who loved the children as if they were her own and indeed adopted them. The authors spared nothing when it came to character description of all the players in this book and that was appreciated by this reader who could finally read a book in which crime victims are depicted as regular people - not sparkling saints but women who lived normal lives in regular towns, paid bills, agonized over their marriages and sex lives, and houses and relatives. Again it must have been especially difficult for Schumann to relate some details of her niece's life which may have caused the family pain or embarrassment but the messase the telling sends is clear - just because a woman or man is human, warts and all and not perfect, is no rationalization for murder. One of my main problems with thecharacterization of Nicole Brown Simpson after her death came from both sides of the case; she was a saint - no - she was a promiscuous wild party girl. She was a human being who was brutally slaughtered. That is the only fact that need be considered.  The book did seem long but in fairness to the authors, it was quite a story and I felt the sections detailing Tim's strange behavior, his moves from home to home, jobs, etc. were important for the reader to be able to understand how he managed to hide what turned out to be a freakishly twisted personality. I closed the book feeling quite sad for the children and the families of the two women.	2001-08-16

Few passings have effected me in the manner in which Ms. Graham's did and I went back to my audiotape of her book to revisit the life of the most powerful woman in American journalism. There are so many reviews, it seemed silly to add another, but loyalty drove me to add my two cents. Born to wealth, shy and reserved by choice, controlled by marriage and the societal pressures of the day, this woman broke out of the preset mold after the long mental illness and eventual suicide of her husband to take the Washington Post to the people and to the Fortune 500 list. She gave the order to run with the Watergate story, to publish the Pentagon Papers, and lived through the pressman's strike. I reveled in her story as read by the woman herself. I cried when her voice broke as she retold the death of her life partner and her regrets about her sometimes limited parenting skills. Katharine Graham crows about her successes and openly admits her failings. Not the usual celebrity self worship and well worth hearing. I'll miss you, Katie.	2001-08-15

The horrific, senseless slaughter of two women and a family by a kid barely in his teens is just the beginning as cop Ken Collins and his community mount a campaign to change the circumstances of how juvenile offenders are treated in Rhode Island. Released at age eighteen!  Interesting is the side story of Collins' deterioration in his private life as he becomes consumed by his obsession to try and make it right for the memories of the victims. I also would have liked to have had a better sense of the victims themselves instead of the extensive description of the slayer and his life. The book is methodical and factual, not a &quot;keep you up biting your nails and checking the locks&quot; kind of read and occasionally becomes rather plodding at times. yet the story deserves to be told and I did finish it. I gave the book three stars, yet I give the town and the participants who worked toward keeping a killer behind bars a solid five.	2001-08-15

Stacey Hanna was eighteen when she moved to Virginia and into the young lesbian scene. She immediately picked up the torch for Kelley &quot;Turtle&quot; Tibbs, infuriating Turtle's close friends and her girlfriend Tracy. One night the triangle of love and obsession explodes into what can only be described as a &quot;wilding&quot; - hours of abduction, indecision, torture and eventual murder of one young woman by a gang of her female peers.   The confessions, the court cases, and the subsequent &quot;where are they now&quot; sections of the book were probably the easiest to read - by the time you got to them, you had finally figured out who all the players were and how they related.   The story is more than frightening. The introduction of each character and her eventual unraveling quickly becomes intertwined with another and then another. In a short time the reader has to keep checking back to the beginning to connect who is who, in love with which girl, dated which other girl, and which ones actually were there on the night in question.   The book is, in some form, and excellent character study and a detailed description how quickly young love turns to hate. I was also intrigued by the detailing of the humiliation some of the girls took from lovers and each other and yet never seriously considered leaving the relationships. I just wished it had come with a score card so I could have kept it all straight.	2001-08-15

Having read a suicide note &quot;in person&quot; so to speak, I was shocked to realize what seems so obvious. The last word is finally gotten and there is no disputing it. In many instances a very few words in this eclectic collection speak volumes about the life left behind such as the man who wrote &quot;Somebody had to do it. Self awareness is everything&quot; or the young guy who penned &quot;I am sorry...I want to keep Dad company.&quot; More than just a listing of comments arranged to titillate, the quotes and commentary are accompanied by some brief histories as well as background and psychological profiles. Who knows why anyone does what they do? The author speaks of a man who left a note reading simply &quot;$36&quot; which was also the amount of cash found in the man's mouth. No one can really be sure of anything but if you have ever lost a loved one to suicide, you are not alone and this collection is a way of sharing the pain of the unexplained.	2001-08-15

Few passings have effected me in the manner in which Ms. Graham's did and I went back to my audiotape of her book to revisit the life of the most powerful woman in American journalism. There are so many reviews, it seemed silly to add another, but loyalty drove me to add my two cents. Born to wealth, shy and reserved by choice, controlled by marriage and the societal pressures of the day, this woman broke out of the preset mold after the long mental illness and eventual suicide of her husband to take the Washington Post to the people and to the Fortune 500 list. She gave the order to run with the Watergate story, to publish the Pentagon Papers, and lived through the pressman's strike. I reveled in her story as read by the woman herself. I cried when her voice broke as she retold the death of her life partner and her regrets about her sometimes limited parenting skills. Katharine Graham crows about her successes and openly admits her failings. Not the usual celebrity self worship and well worth hearing. I'll miss you, Katie.	2001-08-15

It may very well have turned out like the rollicking racketeers in this novel. Film has elevated the Mafioso to either a Brando-like brilliant elder statesman, calculating and controlled Pacino or overweight but sexy Tony Soprano. Breslin spins all those ideas off the map with a tale about &quot;regular guys&quot; who happen to be mobsters and are, in fact, none too successful at it. Graphic and brutal, while maintaining and air of both satire and farce, this story is, with all its laughs, probably closest to the truth. After you worship at the altar of Vito Corleone, meet this other family in a very funny novel in which every mobster has the IQ of Fredo.	2001-08-15

The journey of one red velvet couch across the country invites a diverse cross section of us to sit (or lie or sprawl or jump) on it and be photographed. The photo essay is breathtaking and wonderfully weird with bold colors, outrageous characters and intriguing depictions of Americana. If I won the lottery, I'd buy everyone a copy.	2001-08-15

I have a great affinity for this book for a few reasons, the biggest being there is no longer such scathing political satire that is created in so many layers like this little missive from Roth. The media, literary world, and even the OpEds in many newspapers forget the power wielded and the passion invocked by a well-crafted satire instead of mud slinging and innuendo. The story of Trick E. Dixon and his fervent and funny fight for the sanctity of human life as well as the right to kill anyone who disagrees is the perfect paradox of politics. The persona of Richard Nixon, love him or hate him, is the perfect foil for this kind of dialogue/novel and it is an eerie historical note when so very much of the spirit of Trick E. Dixon was soon to be exposed in our own president.  If you vote, read this book. If you don't, shame on you!	2001-08-15

It is amazing to read his books and realize how many people actually swear these stories are completely true zand happened to a friend of a friend's hairdresser. This outing revisits some old favorites and also brings to light a few new ones.

Stark and realistic, this novel depicts the real life of a  working cop and brings the reader so much more than a week in front of the tube watching &quot;COPS.&quot; Wambaugh's cops are nasty and gentle, mean and kind, liars and cheats, honest men and women, crude and harsh and sensitive and quiet and in other words, real working folks. The narrative style works for me like being told a mysterious tale from a world I could never be part of, but for a brief moment am allowed to view. There is the usual bit of rollicking and raunchy humor, but there is also a heavy dose of pathos because these cops typify the real COPS. Read it.	2001-08-15

Books	5	27	29	N	N	Jackie O said &quot;Oh No!&quot;	The original 1977 Viking printing of this book created a storm of controversy. Jackie Onassis, at that time a book editor at Viking, quietly stated she would resign if the book, a fictional tale of an assassination plot against President Edward Kennedy, was published. Viking published the book and lost the editor. Fumbling with a tide of public backlash on both sides resulted in Archer's retelling of the tale, substituting a woman president instead of Ted in subsequent printings. Although the book is a better than average thriller, the simple facts behind the publishing makes it a worthwhile read.	2001-08-15
US	52913418	R6BQPBOLRIDAN	0843945745	441217989	The Tides	Books	3	0	0	N	N	The Tide Is Out	The cover of this book is a marketing mistake - the eerie yellowish green with the foreboding building in the foggy background (which, by the way is not even close to the description of the building in the novel) denotes a cheesy horror treat, the kind that are great for summers in a rented beach cottage or passing along to your teenage kids. This one came to me used and I opened it to realize it actually had a plot and storyline which was not pockmarked every ten pages by a gruesome murder. It had real promise. It's a shame it was so difficult to get through. However it was also not marketed as a ghost story and a rather intellectual one at that which may be the problem with the book. Even the author can't figure out which audience to target. The story of a nursing home administrator, her hospitalized father, and her (perhaps, perhaps not) long dead mother returning to claim her baby had the beginnings of a solid story but the writing is abrupt and sometimes without segue, leaving the reader lost and requiring a recap. The character of the heroine - Rebecca - seems as if she needs a good slap to wake her up from her disorganization and lack of any personal life. It was hard for me to actually like her and root for her as she seemed insipid and boring. The more interesting characters are the patients and residents of The Tides and I wish  the author would have given us more backstory on them - in fact they would have made a wonderfully creepy book. The ending fell completely flat and left me wanting more. The plot is resolved yet we never figure oout what happenes to the characters. The Tides started coming in strong and never quite made the grade for me.	2001-08-15

Hailey's meticulous attention to detail with regard to every aspect of the story including the inner workings of an international airport under stress in that decade demand the reader's attention. The plot revolves around a beleaguered airport manager juggling a failing marriage and a crisis on location, his arrogant and philandering pilot brother in law, an out of work man teetering over into desperation and how their paths cross on one dangerous night. Absorbing and thrilling, even after all this time.	2001-08-15

The vestiges of responsibility and family begin to tear and no where is it better illustrated than in depicting the life of Theresa. Theresa is a lonely single girl, teaching underprivledged kids during the day and cruising the bar scene looking for love after dark. Living in the shadow of her seemingly fabulous sister, Theresa born the shame of spine curvature (eventually corrected by surgery), the indifference of her parents, lack of friends, and the pain of empty love relationships. Theresa during the day, Terry is her night time persona who takes the young teacher to levels she never dreamed off as the story unfolds. Theresa is at odds with the good girl vs. bad girl images and yet is spurned by physical pleasure and the thought of a lasting and pleasurable relationship. The book's end is shocking and inevitable as Theresa looks for love in all the wrong places. A cautionary tale which rings true today, a copy should be given to every Washington intern.	2001-08-15

Outlaw ex FBI agent Jade Marlow hired by a freaky FBI Director, his beautiful and strait-laced female counterpart, a crazed and brilliant killer, and perhaps the most innovative incarceration facility in modern fiction. The sub plot involving the killer's parents is a riveting story in itself. I found a major stumbling block, however, which refused to allow me to &quot;suspend&quot; my disbelief on almost every page - the character of Jade Marlow himself. Marlow, in name as well as character development, is a Hollywood cliche taken past the extreme and left flailing out in space to disturb the reader. He's tough, he's big and bad, he has no sympathy or empathy, in fact, he's just not likable at all. Not your usual cliche - boozy detective fraught with a past tragedy - he is a vile character (yes he does have a tragedy in his past - of course) but his lack of an emotion other than anger becomes boring very quickly. Too bad, as it really deflects from the story, inducing yawns when there really should have been nail biting. In addition, I think The Tower itself could have been the star of this fictional piece had it been used more effectively instead of just as a big build up to open and then a place to go to resolve the story. This one disappointed me.	2001-05-16

That is the case with Craig's book. The  creeping fear that gradually consumes the three children of Navy widow (is  her husband dead or not?) Clary Hale as they begin to realize their mother  has disappeared into the night without leaving a clue, is so thick you will  find yourself shifting uncomfortably in your chair. Craig has an excellent  turn of phrase and he sets you up to feel exactly what each of his tortured  characters feel.<br />Gradually the nosy elderly neighbor and the oversexed,  love starved cleaning woman also draw you in with their own theories and  speculation as to what has happened to Clary and their stories jump off the  page as we see what they do not - the fact they are very involved in the  disappearance. In addition, they are followed and approached by a Naval  officer who states he can assist them in finding their mother. He is  charming and commanding - but is he what he says he is? The children's  search takes them on an agonizing road trip with deadly results as they try  to piece together the mystery, using clues that may very well lead them to  their own deaths. The plot hinges on a tragedy from Clary's teenage days.  To tell more will ruin the plot, so I will just say the book is DEFINITELY  worth one long rainy night, if you enjoy a good, adult scare.	2000-09-01

Never a fan of continuing characters in mystery novels, I tripped over the first one in a used book store and have  kept coming back for the never ending saga of &quot;Calamity  Stephanie&quot; the bounty hunter who cannot shoot straight but can  recognize a bona fide jersey girl a mile away. This time Stephanie is  plagued by the disappearance of her mentor Ranger, a serial nut who refuses  to be brought to justice, two spacey &quot;businessmen&quot; who operate  out of a party house, her &quot;big-haired nemesis&quot; and the untimely  arrival of her swinging single grandmother who seems older than God and as  infamous as Elvis. While Grandma takes driving lessons and sports a new  boyfriend, Stephanie tries to decide who she loves and who she can trust as  she tails her elusive mentor while questioning his guilt in a mob family  murder. All this while paying some attention to her sometimes boyfriend and  full time cop, Joe. Great dialogue and wonderful plot twists, as usual.  Just read it! My own 84 year old grandmother demands each new Plum tale is  Fed Exed to her in her assisted care home. Grandma is her hero. She'll be  yours, too.	2000-08-09

Taking the serial killer to new heights, Ashbaugh has written  an absorbing book about an investment firm going up in flames as a fire bug  targets the wives of top execs. Chief Fire Marshal Jake Ferguson, who  carries his own pack of matches from his past, has the detail of tracking  the bitter barbeque-r across the state of NY in an effort to stop the  cooking. In order to understand his prey (and the readers to understand the  story), Ferguson learns the ins and outs of the stock market as he teaches  us why and how a fire can burn out of control. After the middle of the  book, the suspect is no longer a secret and even his reasoning is divulged  before the traditional climax and exposure, but the book still held my  interest due to the fact the author has made the characters appealing and  interesting. The book ends abruptly, however, even with all situations  resolved and left me with a rather empty feeling. I will never read about a  fire again, I must say, without thinking of facts I did learn from reading  this interesting but overly long mystery.	2000-08-09

Her character build of Tom Maimoni, a slipshod liar, NASA  imposter, fake collegiate alumnus and all around creepy guy kept me riveted  to the end. The strange death of local Martha Brailsford sent the small,  close knit sailing/witching community of Salem Mass into a tailspin. The  tailspin turned hurricane when numbers of women came forward after her  death to report they had been pawed and humiliated by Maimoni.

This was again, one of my summer beach reads, to be finished up on a stormy Florida night, all alone in the house. The book was slow to start and I had to stick with it - having no life made that easy. But it took such a strange turn, I began to feel disturbed by the notion that day by day, a personal gradually becomes less and less noticeable, and finally virtually invisible to others. Is this a statement about society as a whole, I was thinking, or am I just being horrified by fiction? Bob struggles through his day to day existence as he fighst to hang on to something, anything at all, that sets him apart from the teeming masses - yet cannot seem to find it. Perhaps eventually his acceptance of the terms of his new life may be the one act that does indeed make him &quot;unique&quot; and at the same time, a pariah. I found the ending anti climactic, but here I am, two weeks after completing the novel, still looking at rather bland folks on the street and thinking as they pass &quot;What the heck did that person look like?&quot; And wondering if one doesn't make a supreme effort to get out, will they too become &quot;Ignored&quot;? I recommend this book to anyone who who feels they may need to do a little something within themselves to curb that desire to be completely accepted - at any cost.	2000-07-13

There isn't much you can say about a food product that once nurtured the native Americans and now  offers itself up in supplication to yearly mutilation in the name of Jack  O' Lantern, so why bother? Instead treat yourself to glorious lit and art  directed photos depicting fields of orange globes, pumpkins gently resting  in the snow, and proudly standing guard on a porch backlight by a beautiful  blue sky.

My darling, I must say when one writes a juicy &quot;insider&quot; story of the pseudo rich and famous (but in reality troubled and rather tawdry), one tends to build themselves up into a super hero of pristine proportions. May I say I found this modern day Aesop's  nonfictional fable to be just the opposite? This bizarre book, not at all  for the squeamish, is written by one who is unafraid to bare himself along  as an active participant in freakdom along with the enormous cast of  &quot;club kid&quot; characters. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, as well as a  strange living autopsy cannot begin to explain what you will find between  the pages as you read about how those 80's hometown disco drug addicted  divas really lived. There is another world outside the &quot;Wall  Street&quot; mentality which personified the 1980's and it's dark and seamy  and unbelievable to the middle American eye. You must have the gumption to  pay strict attention to the flow of the story, which occasionally requires  backing up a few paragraphs. When James loses his place, so do we. It is  sometimes diffcult to follow his ramblings, but if the effort is made,  suddenly the book opens up into a story with a moral. It's a definite  contender for the &quot;This is your brain on drugs&quot; Bible. James St.  James was an eyewitness to the downfall of a counter culture, King Alig,  and fellow drug addicts who actually felt they were part of something  important until it overdosed on itself. Many of the anecdotes are  tragically hilarious as these stumblebums hook new sources for money and  media hype, as well as the stalkings of those perceived as &quot;the  beautiful people.&quot;  Interesting as well, the manner in which he lays  out the ease in which a young kid with low self esteem can be lured into a  new family situation all in the name of &quot;belonging.&quot; He is self  effacing by disguising himself in a self important manner as he tells the  story of the murder, and develops into a psychotic Alice who has fallen  into a deep hole. He winks at us, yet it seems a desperate gesture....	2000-07-13

I picked up The Hampton Affair this week and settled down for an afternoon of murder and mishap. I  ended up with a wicked sunburn - couldn't put it down. This intricate  thriller twists and turns around three main charcters: a vain and straying  voyueristic husband of an ultra rich woman, a bisexual blue collar teenage  manipulator, and the local detective. It takes the usual &quot;haves vs  have nots&quot; and kicks it up a closer to a Hitchcockian notch.

I applaud Farr for her eyes and ears used to bring this twisted story to life, and yes, she does not glamorize the killers, instead  displaying them obviously as what they are in real life - sick and  disgusting losers. Clark a grandiose, overblown ass and Bundy his oversexed  ignorant slave. I just wondered, after reading the book, if there was one  single person involved in the story from witnesses to cosp, that was  pleasant or had any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Not the killers, mind  you, but there had to be someone in law enforcement and investigating worth  applauding. I didn't care for some of the presentations of the  investigators. Five stars for research though. And I wonder - what has  become of Carol's sons? Crime fans - read this book.	1999-06-01

In the world of paperback thrillers, it was a page turner with plenty of twists and a great insight into the grown up lives of former beauty queens.

I picked up the book not because I was especially interested in the story but because of the slick cover (raised on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, colors are an intricate part of my literary existance). It's a helluva book. The reconstructed story of everyone's favorite hero is gripping and heartbreaking. From his bright beginnings in &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; to the grim realization he would never play anyone but Superman, not even himself, you will be possessed by this sad story. His childhood, controlling mother, absent father, domineering mistresses, and twisting life paths were told in a fascinating and novel-style manner. I kept hoping for more concrete documentation regarding Reeves' death, but the compelling details which do exist insure you will never again think of The Man Of Steel as a suicide victim, but perhaps instead a true victim.
