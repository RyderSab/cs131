US	52952426	RLFDUT69Y66EE	1579547117	619620568	Field Notes on the Compassionate Life: A Search for the Soul of Kindness	Books	5	22	23	N	N	One of the best books I have read in a long, long time	Barasch's style is casual and yet compelling, drawing the reader into his quest to understand and practice compassion. I find it altogether easy to relate to his questions, his search, and his desire to live compassionately. He is not a guru sharing rarified wisdom, but a fellow traveler whose experiences, obstacles, questions, and frustrations mirror my own. At the same time, he clearly asserts that compassionate living is attainable not only for the mystic few but for any willing to pursue it with an open heart. Hence the book is empowering, encouraging, exciting, and illuminating. I can't recommend it highly enough.	2005-04-14

I'd put it down from time to time because the ideas it contained were so radical that it took me a long time to absorb them. This book has had a major and lasting impact on my life and on my relationship with my body. It started me on my own spiral of acceptance and introduced me to a whole new way of thinking about my body, about food, about exercise, about my place in the world. I highly recommend this book to any woman who has ever hated her body. The ideas in this book will bring peace, enlightenment, and healing. I wish you a joyful journey.<br />--Mary Ray Worley	2002-05-16

Alicia Mundy tells the story very well and has you on the edge of your seat much of the time. I'm not usually much of a one for stories of victims, lawyers, drug companies, and the FDA, but I couldn't put the book down. It reads like a thriller, and the information it contains is especially vital to anyone who has ever taken Fen-Phen. Even if you would never consider taking a diet drug, you need to learn how ineffectual the FDA has become in the face of the super-powerful drug companies. The drug companies involved knew about the serious health risks associated with these drugs and made every effort not to inform doctors and drug users about the potential dangers. Worse yet, they knew that the drug didn't work. And although they were recommending it for long-term use, they had tested it only for short-term use. This book will make you angry, and given that nearly five times as many people have died from the Fen-Phen debacle as from faulty Firestone tires, we should be angry--angry enough to get Congress to put some teeth back in the FDA so that this sort of tragedy never happens again.	2001-08-29

Looking closely at the characters, there are small divots around the edges where they weren't fully inked. The overall impression is of ragged, weak, and somehow slightly disorienting text. It is an annoying chore to read.  (I've seen many copies in many bookstores: they are all the same gray-on-off-white mess.)<br />The content is excellent. It's surprisingly up-to-date for a book published in 1996. The occasional use of calculus is illuminating, though the occasonal code dump is not.	2001-05-14

I have more energy, greater range of motion, and more bounce than before. I'm much more eager for my regular walks than I used to be. I'd love it if Rochelle shared more information on how the body mechanics of large women are unique, but it's clear from the effects of the exercises that she's done her homework and that her plan works. I have a long history of problems with my neck and shoulders, and the upper-body stretches are especially helpful at getting my muscles to settle down and loosen up. I've been struggling with my exercise program on my own for a long time, and although the exercises in Rochelle's book seem very simple, they have had a profound effect on my sense of physical well-being. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this program to any large woman. The proof is in the execution. You won't know what a great program this is until you've worked at it for a couple of weeks and felt the result. And you won't have to hurt yourself to do it. The exercises are gentle, easy to do, and adjustable depending on your needs and limitations.	2001-02-06

I've read many medieval murder mysteries, and I found this one in particular and all the Catherine LeVendeur novels especially compelling. The detail is so rich that you begin almost to smell the smells and hear the sounds of the middle ages. The protagonists are not just modern-day people plunked into a medieval setting--they think like medievals. And they transport the reader as effectively as any characters can to a very different time and place. Not only is this a must read, it's a must read again and again. Sharan Newman should quit her day job and write full time. Her research is meticulous and pays off in an amazing array of rich and compelling detail. Read this book	1997-07-26
