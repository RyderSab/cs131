What dat ole forty year ole `oman doing wid her hair swingin' down her back lak some young gal?\\"<br /><br />I know nothing of Zora Neale Hurston except that she wrote a great classic in Their Eyes Were Watching God sometime in the nineteen thirties.<br />The book makes its focal point around Janie Crawford, the envy of all other black sisters because of her light skin and her below the waist long hair.  A strong and independent Afro-American woman, Janie knows what she wants out of life and leaves her town of Eatonville searching for it; finding herself at the altar on three occasions.<br />Forced more or less into the first marriage with Logan which did not last longer than a snowball in hell, Janie does her best to be a good wife, but at this stage she is still young and does not understand what is required of her in this unity which is on the verge of breaking down. As this happens, she quickly hooks up with the sweet talking Joe Starks, a man whom she looks up to and who will become the mayor of the small county where they live. Life with Joe Starks is different to the marriage with Logan as all the folks respect Starks who is responsible, thoroughly arrogant, stubborn and forces his opinions and standards on Janie, like it or not.<br />But a reprieve comes in Janie Crawford's life after the death of the Mayor, which finds her grown into maturity and with a better comprehension of the world around her, and a better understanding of her desires and how she may acquire this love which has eluded her all these years. From her past experiences Janie reaches out for marriage the third time over with a man twelve years her junior, and this is when she will taste love at its sweetest for the first time, and be acquainted with pain, racial prejudice and great loss. For lovers of classical books, this book comes highly recommended!!!<br />Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 28/03/05)	2005-03-28

And suddenly Hassan's voice whispered in my head: For you a thousand times over.

His book cannot be put down for a long time because it is apt to rest in your thoughts until you get back to the fate and fortunes of these indelible characters.<br />We are introduced to Amir, and his playmate Hassan who are deep friends and spend their recreation time flying kites, playing games in the street, and getting up to the normal mischievous things boys get up to. Baba, Amir's father and Ali, Hassan's dad raises the boys themselves as they have both lost their mothers. Ali and Hassan work as servants for Baba's household but yet they are privileged to be treated just like family.<br /><br />Mr. Hosseini shows us in this page-turner just how Afghanistan changes in a hurry from a place of some stability and wealth at least for Baba's household to a place of war as the Russians make they way into the country. We are made to see how the deepest of friendships can be betrayed all because of guilty consciences and convictions. The wealthy flee leaving everything included their lovely homes with their rich furniture and interiors, whilst the poor families have no choice but to remain in Afghanistan to be subjected to the wills and fancies of the Taliban.<br /><br />After the war this country is unrecognizable.  We see Amir leaving San Francisco where he has spent his adult years journeying back to his birthplace that holds all the memories he has carried with his all these years. These memories though disturbing have pulled him back but why? The answers are all the way through this well written first novel.  May Mr. Hosseini continue to entertain us with his literary work.

I have become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mother's children; because zeal for your house has eaten me up.\\"  Psalms 69. 7-9<br /><br />I have never read anything from Mike Bickle, but I have to say for sure that I was very refreshed and blessed by this work AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART.<br /><br />This book is based on the Life of King David who in the Bible and everywhere on earth, is known as the man after God's own heart.  God had great love for this man David, who, despite what he was going through, always knew that God was there for him. He was never afraid to approach God, even when he had sinned and David like us was a man who had sin.  But he was always quick to repent, for he trusted God and loved God greatly.  Many of us sin but we are always afraid that God is too much into punishing us that He does not have time to forgive.  Not so with David.  David loved God passionately and his heart was fixed on God.  God had chosen David while he was still tending sheep and perhaps it was God's constant and attentive love along with His protective arm around David from this time and right through the battles of his life that David was ever aware of, more than most people are. David knew how to confront God in weakness for we went after God in a big way. He was in constant prayer and fasting, and had a zeal for building a placeof worship and prayer, a zeal for building God's temple.<br /><br />While everyone was looking for the mistakes that David had made, David got on with his life pursuing God and clinging to him in body mind and soul, begging to be cleansed, begging to be perfect in His sight.<br /><br />There is so much to learn from this book and I will suggest this fine material for all Christains and the newly Born Again.<br /><br />Good move Mr Bickle!!!<br /><br />Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 25/02/05)	2005-02-26

She tells us of the day-to-day agony of what these families went through during the investigations, and how this trial affected their lives.  Not only for the girls who were thrown off the bridge, but for poor Tom Cummins as well, who at first was held as a suspect.

Gloria does not intend to lift a finger to do any domestic work in the home, no matter how slight; while Anthony who considers himself an aesthete, finds it quite hard to get his act together and instead of buckling down to some work, prefers instead to hang with his wife and their friends on nightly binges.

To be honest I did not want to make a fruit salad. The Lord spoke to my heart that serving God was actually serving him.  I obediently made the fruit salad.\\"<br /><br />Reduce Me To Love is one of Joyce Meyer's favourites that I've heard being talked about for some time now.  It is no wonder that when I  was blessed by a dear friend with his book as a gift, I was on cloud nine, and anxious to finish everything I was reading just to start this book.<br /><br />This book teaches us in great detail about love; a small word with such a deep and profound meaning.<br />It is the new commandment which Jesus gave his disciples: to love one another and by doing so, prove their discipleship.<br /><br />Mrs. Meyer draws on her personal experiences as she demonstrates the many respects of love and it's purest motives.<br />What stays indelibly in my mind was how Jesus uses himself as an example in today's world. Whatever good deeds we do for one another, we actually do for Him and in the same light if we treat our brother with disdain we do it also to Him. We cannot get away from it, Jesus convicts us in the very name of love as he encourages us to walk in the Spirt. I would like to encourage all of those who love reading Christian literature to find this book fast and get back to loving God; the One who first loved us, before the foundation of the world.<br />Bless someone soon with this brilliant book.<br />Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE)	2004-03-08

Besides the fear that his undeserving children will acquire his estate, there is his repetitive obsession with a crime of passion he believes he committed sometime back in his youth in Denmark. This crime brings him constant nightmares and cold sweats in his awakening and sleeping hours for they never leave him.<br />His constant companion is his Cambodian girlfriend who takes care of him, does all the chores and hardly leaves his side.  This is a touching story that will keep Mr. Olafsson's fans on the brink of anxiety.<br />Lovers of Olaf Olafsson should not miss this beautiful novel which I believe is his first book...

That person is none other than Christian Benediktsson, the main character of this novel.<br />After leaving his family in Iceland, Christian Benediktsson becomes involved in a tragic affair in New York with Klara an actress. As the relationship comes to an end, Christian's funds begin to dwindle, forcing him to take on small jobs, waiting tables and whatever else. He is waiting tables at a big hotel when he is noted by William Randolph Hearst for his competence and attentiveness.  He offers him a job which he readily accepts leaving New York for California to become butler to Hearst and Marion Davis, his good friend.<br />He enjoys his years working at San Simeon, the massive and lavish estate in California where Hearst entertains celebrities and politicians regularly.  He is Hearst's second man and in charge of all activities at San Simeon, however large or small.  Nothing can happen without Christain's involvement and he is well respected in the circles that flaunt this wealthy dwelling place.<br />But Christian has his moments too, and it is only when settled at San Simeon that he becomes haunted by his past life.  Everything he sees or hears draws him back to Iceland.  He entertains us with his thoughts as he writes letters to his wife Elisabet; letters that never leave; letters that never reach the far-a-way destination.<br />Mr. Olafsson has written a clear and captivating novel proving that however far one runs when the things of life get uncomfortable, when the crunch comes, there is nowhere to hide.

Celia Lytton is the main character who takes over the helm of the family business as the country goes to war. A strong-willed woman, Celia displays her good business acumen and makes Lyttons a successful and competitive establishment. As the family men leave England to fight in the war, there are butterflies in the womens' stomachs each time as they worry if and whether they would ever see their loved ones again. There are powerful women in this book who take their responsibility, virtually heading their households, dispersing their children from London up to country homes away from the bombs, and establishing temporary shelters for the the wounded men who return from the war in despair, and some total incapacitated.<br />As the novel weaves it's intoxicating magic, you will meet Oliver Lytton, Celia's kind husband who becomes a tiresome and tempermental soul much to Celia's agitation, causing her to look elsewhere for love. You'll also meet Margaret Lytton, Oliver's sister who helps Celia manage the publishing house. Then of course there are Celia's twin daughters, Adele and Venetia; two playfully wicked girls; silent Giles and her adopted daughter Barty Miller. With exciting authors at the publishing house, especially one particular one who makes a marked impact on Celia Lytton's life, this plot twists and turns with the reader never knowing what will take place on the following page.

The other sons Dennis who David who are happily married, one living in the family home of Tealing where he does his veterinary work and the other lives in France with his wife Veronique.<br />Glass showcases the lives of this family as they come for their father's family in Tealing Scotland. This section was very arresting to my mind which I consider the nucleus and focal point of the entire book.  Joy and tears reign looking back at the old times and reminiscing about the past lives of their lost parents, friends they used to know.  There is a lot of compassion here too causing you to start rallying around this family who sometimes does not know if they are going or coming, but they are lovable nevertheless.  Featured in the book too are quite a lot of Fenno friends all artist in their own right.......photographers, music reviewers, writers, book lovers and the beat goes on.<br />In the third section entitled BOYS, this is the shortest section yet and this is when Fenno meets Fern, his father's former lover in long island.<br />This is a wonderful contemporary novel to be savoured and not rushed through.

Forty dollars.<br /><br />The part of this true piece of non-fiction that really caused me alarm was the fact that the killers were never repentant or remorseful of their crime. They laughed about it, they slept after they had committed their crime and ate their bellies full. They had no care for anyone but themselves, and then again I'm a bit doubtful of that myself.<br /><br />The book is well written and actually there is  far more detail about the hunted than the dead.  I would have appreciated being told much more about the Clutters who fell victims because of two uneducated....unreasonable men who thought the world owed them so much more.

There is quite a lot to grasp and understand as Max Lucado walks us through The Lord's Prayer, and through the House of God starting at the living room, through to the kitchen, and finally the chapel.<br />This prayer which is said by millions all around the world every day, is sometimes said in ritual style with the deepness of it taken for granted, though not intentionally.  But Mr. Lucado uses Our Lord's Prayer as a floor plan of the House of God, with a step by step description of how God meets our needs when we dwell in him, and how we can live our lives completely in God's favour as we obey this great Prayer.<br />As Christians with our sins forgiven which Jesus paid in full on the Cross, we must act accordingly as the prayer directs us.  Not wanting to give too much away let me encourage you to read this book soon and cherish the lovely way it is written.  It has truly blessed my heart and I know it will yours too.  Mr. Lucado.....thank you once again for the wonderful revelations of this book. I pray that God will continue to bless you and your family, and of course your literary work.<br />Heather P.

NOBODY DOES IT BETTER	\\"When I got to the end of St. Matthias Gap, I would stand for a while and watch the drug store. The large bottles of glass that contained 'sweets' medicines and pills of all sorts of toughness and strength and sweetness.\\"<br /><br />Nobody does it better than Mr. Austin 'Tom' Clarke. Nobody can<br />take us back into those long ago times with literature so touching, so real, so magical, so painful, so peaceful and picturesque, and yet so lovely.<br /><br />For Austin 'Tom' Clarke is a man for all seasons and beneath his humour and fun-poking there is a depth and intensity that makes his story so very arresting and captivating. I must say this book stimulated my mind to such an extent that it was not always easy to put it down just for a few moments. Giving an autobiographical account of his life as a youngster, we venture with him into his life at Combermere and how the school system worked at the time. Latin was a favourite with Clarke and his friends but unfortunately not having the money for the text books the information had to be handwritten from the textbooks of one of the privileged boys. Even for Scripture lessons when one would have thought that there would have been so many Bibles in the island, some guys had to write out Acts Of the Apostles in long hand. It was during wartime and things were terribly scarce and jobs hard to come by. Most of the people in the village worked for the Whites doing domestic work or at the Marine hotel in the same capacity. So it was the norm to emulate everything English.....studying English history, society and manners. After all the country was under Colonial control and Barbadians would have it no other way.  They knew no other way.<br /><br />Mr. Clarke doesn't fail to humour us as he recounts his days in the St. Michael's Cathedral or throw us into a fit of nostalgia as he reminisces of the Brilliantine shining on his hair the first day at Combermere......so real you can actually feel the broiling hot sun and smell the sweet hairdressing grease running down his youthful neck.<br /><br />One of the things I loved about Austin Clarke's book came towards the end. He describes in detail his many walks on sunny afternoons along Hastings main road when the sun scorched the bottom of his feet leaving tar marks on the surface. He describes how quiet the area was in those days, with hardly anyone walking the streets or any vehicular traffic. He would always walk slowly as he approached the drug store for that was one of his favourite places where he stood outside and surveyed the place, looking at the sweets on display and inhaling the various potent medicines and of course the Lysol. The ever-faithful Lysol would always be wafting in the atmosphere; then as you extended your eyes towards the back of the store, there would be the druggist in white, and through the open window, the sea gleamed in the background. Clarke embraced a kind of peace in these surroundings.....a peace real tangible to my mind.<br /><br />I would encourage all literature lovers to read this book and compare those old time days to the times we're living in now. The diversity in the culture and the innocence of what it was really like living under British rule.<br /><br />In fact, this is a book for everyone.<br /><br />Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 11-03-03)running down his youthful neck.

This book is written in local dialect which I thought would be tedious but I was in for a surprise for it was not.  After a while I began to love the dialect as much as I loved this book to tell the truth. No wonder John Steinbeck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940 for this work.<br />The Grapes of Wrath centres on the Joads; a Dustbowl family from Oklahoma whose land was confiscated from them, along with others in the Midwestern states. All these families head for California where it is understood that there is lots of opportunity in that golden state to start again.  This being in immigrant work or farm labour in grape, pear and peach reaping.The trek is long but it's supposed to be well worth it with expectant good wages. and somewhere decent to live, somewhere to call home.<br />Meet the Joad family of Ma Joad; a good Christian woman and as the strength and spine of the family, she holds a tight reign on the entire bunch of them retaining their team spirit, and keeping the morale alive amongst them.  Then there is Casey  a sometimes preacher man; Tom Joad her eldest son  who is driven and afraid of nobody, but just anxious to get out to California to make some money; his brother Noah, a man consumed by quiet moments and little to say; Al the brother who drives the loaded down truck from Oklahoma, out to the West; Uncle John a restless soul, but who can blame him!  These along with Pa Joad, the Joad sister Rose of Sharon, and the young ones Ruthie and Winfield, they make up the exodus.  An exodus like none ever seen, we share in each heartache and disappointment as well as their hopefulness which Ma stokes daily.<br />As the Joad family turn from farmers in their own right to immigrant workers, it gets harder for the family to retain their dignity.  The reader will find himself living through these characters lives, and experiencing gratefulness for the little things which are so often taken for granted day in and day out.<br />I would love to encourage anyone interested in good literature, to get your hands on this powerful book soon.

This is a quality Classic, full of enchantment, and taking us back to the twenties just after the war.<br />I took my time and savoured every word as it flowed along with a mysterious edge, causing me to be somewhat unsure of where you I was actually heading next.<br />Narrated by  Nick Carraway who had been anxious to come out to the East (New York) after spending a rather dull childhood in the Midwest, I found Carraway a very interesting person. A bit of a schemer sometimes; one is never sure how he really feels about Jay.<br />Jay Gatsby is the enigma in this story; a rather poor officer who before he goes to war falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful Daisy Fay from Louisville.  But what happens after the war???<br />The Great Gatsby having heard that his lovely Daisy has tied the knot with the uncouth, ill-mannered and filthy rich Tom Buchanan, goes to great measures to become wealthy too.... by all means.  When he accomplishes this, he buys an elaborate house not far from the Buchanans where he hosts glittering and five star parties most weekends; with the hope that Daisy will eventually turn up.<br />You will be entertained and shocked by the things Jay Gatsby does all in the name of love. His parties filled with lots of celebrities and Hollywood people do nothing to assuage his troubled and lonely soul. I felt his pain in this book and his isolation which you will experience too when you read this book.<br />This is one of the best Classics on the market, even more so now that it has been updated.  I highly recommend this book and can't wait to get my hands on F. Scott Fitzgerald's other updated ones; The Beautiful and The Dammed and Tender Is The Night. Fitzgerald is a boss and oh; the cover is soooo beautiful.	2002-05-09

We ate, and well, but who remembers what?  Chicken Kiev, Saltimbocca, Escalope de Veau, whatever it was; it was the expression of a civilized cuisine, as far above our usual fare as manna is above a baked potato.  A pretty table was part of it too; flowers, wine in fragile glasses, silver whose weight was a satisfaction in the hand.  But at the heart of it all was the two people who had prepared the occasion..........Sid and Charity\\"<br /><br />Crossing to safety is a novel which I took my time with, and savoured every written word.  This was a  blessing for it was my first experience with this author, and now having the majority of his books on my wish list, I'm going to have a ball.<br /><br />We read about Larry and Sally Morgan and Charity and Sid Lang; two couples who meet in Madison Wisconsin, where their husbands are professors at the same university.  The two couples become fast friends like love at first sight and soon they are so tight and friendly, they are sharing everything.........food, houses, money, children; everything.  The Langs who are wealthy and generous, share their possessions unstintingly with the Morgans.  There is no adventure too exciting that they cannot enjoy together; no country too far that they cannot visit together and enjoy it's culture; no meal too costly or exotic that they cannot share and the beat goes on.<br /><br />THE LANGS AND THE MORGANS leave no holds barred.  They openly display their affection for each other, refusing to hide the fact that they enjoy their friendship which is based on love and trust.  Their frienship endures and suffers all things, be they good, bad or indifferent, also creating bonds within their own families.  Sid cannot live without Charity who is a perfectionist and a very dominant character, and Larry who holds a special bond with his wife Sally even more so, after a severe turn of events.<br /><br />The novel starts with Larry as the narrator of the story.  The couples are now in their sixties and the Morgans have been summoned from their New Mexico home to the Langs Vermont home retreat.  A location where memories are still fresh and alive of past summers days and nights, and where presently there are experiencing some crucial developments.  Developments important to them all and their children.<br /><br />Larry takes us into the story from the beginning when they first met in Wisconsin, until the present where they have gotten on in age.  Bless someone with this great book as a Mother's day gift, and you will make an indelible mark on that person's life.

We meet Daisy the housewife and her older daughter whose life is on the verge of collapse when her career-oriented husband leaves her for a more sophisticated woman as she tries to fend for herself with two young children and a baby on the way.

Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Work Of Excellence For All Would-Be Entrepreneurs	These stories which are put together by Finance Columnists Gail Liberman and her husband Alan Lavine are about ordinary people like you and me who have come into extraordinary wealth.<br />These stories presented to us people who overcame poverty and middle-class lifestyles, to achieve financial success to the highest degree.<br />This book contains inspiration for everyone, but first let me say here that these people did not become successful by good luck charms or magic or by just simply having  a 'godfather' or any such thing. The folk in these stories were strong-minded individuals with faith in the ventures they had set their sights on, and they all made it single-handedly. They were not from high-society backgrounds or people with influential friends who were always in the limelight, for they had tremendous struggles, fighting against great odds.  Each of them had some handicap.....some stumbling block in their pathways.  Eg. Jay Thiessens who built a five million a year business was an illiterate man......yet he was a great mathematician.<br />These millionaires were especially challenged as children but most of them were given the encouragement from family members which allowed them inner strength and taught them how to make sacrifices and to be fearless of taking risks.<br />Read this book of excellence and meet David Copperfield, Maya Angelou, David Geffen, Lisa Renshaw, Del Hedgepath, Juan Rodriguez and so many more. You'll definitely be motivated and hopefully your strong will too will carry you from RAGS TO RICHES.  Highly recommended!!<br />Nutface<br />March 9th, 2002	2002-03-10

Giselle has all that she wants but the only think lacking as far as she could see is a good partner.  With her nose in the air she has a choice between Vishnu a construction worker who she physically attracted to, and Robert another man of her ilk who makes good money and will be accepted in the upper class Trinidad society.<br />CARNIVAL SEASON is coming up soon and this is the event of the year for all Trinidadians.  Giselle however will make her choice sometime around then......but the ups and downs and her ifs and buts will determine who her suitor will be. She wants what she considers the good parts from both men.........the physical and good looking side from Vishnu and Robert's intellectual brains and money, and obviously the one everyone will expect her to wed. What will she do???<br />It may sound like a simple book.............but it was so full of excitement as Carnival draws near, and you're drawn into real transformation.The reader will have a wonderful time and a tremendous surprise at the end that will encourage you to think again.

A very true to life book where as the characters advance in reaching their destiny however small, they are always setbacks and stumbling blocks, not allowing them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, reminding us of the pathways we've walked before and are forever walking in.

After reading Middle Age, I intend to delve into more of Ms. Oates' other work.<br />Middle Age is set in Salt-Hill-on-Hudson which is a small community outside Manhattan.  Here, the middle age folk are young at heart and sexy, as well as very wealthy.  Most of the couples are divorced or not living well with each other....but the are taking everything in stride, and just enjoying life as much as they possibly can, until the entire community is sent into total shock and despair. Salt-Hill-on-Hudson will never be the same again.  Adam Brendt (a newcomer of sorts in the community) dies suddenly after rescuing a young girl from drowning.<br />The women of the community take this death very hard, as they were all attracted to Adam in different ways....while the men grieve too for they will miss their manly talks his ever-present advise....and of course a drink together in the pub.  In fact the men of Salt-Hill-on-Hudson hold Adam in very high esteem even as his past remains a mystery to  them all.<br />Joyce Carol Oates is so brilliant at throwing delighful characters together and I found myself having deep empathy for both the male and females sexes in this story. So true to life; you can feel your own heart breaking for these characters.<br />With this remarkable read you'll meet lots of people like you and me and some of our friends, and also their children. I give this book five stars as it is a page turner with great depth.  But then again Ms.Oates never disappoints.....read it real soon.<br />...	2002-01-09

Coraghessan Boyle, and I was very impressed by his work.<br /><br />This book is set in Los Angeles and focuses strongly on two couples from totally different social and economical backgrounds. Kyra and Delaney Mossbacher are the upper class Americans; while Candido and America Rincon are illegal immigrants from South of the border.....Mexico.<br /><br />The Tortilla Curtain is the border between Mexico and Los Angeles which the immigrants cross illegally to find work as labourers and a better way of life in that state.<br /><br />The Mexicans  endure severe hardships for little money as they enter this country of the 'well to do'.  Meanwhile the 'upper crust' are flourishing for all to see, their main problem being to keep the immigrants out. As much as they are rich and better off one begins to feel that the immigrant Mexican has a more contented heart. They seem fulfilled at times with a deep satisfaction, passion and feeling that the 'upper crust' are unable to project.  They are poor.....but their spirits  are strong and hard to break.<br /><br />See what life becomes for these two couples from opposite sides of the track....and you will find these characters living in your memories for a long time.

The poems are heartfelt and totally inspirational as Helen Steiner Rice shares her precious thoughts with us, and eases our burdens through her written word.<br />Mostly for those bent in acknowledging God's precious creation also the magic of love.....and also some poems suitable for kids.  Her work is very simply written and it is so amazing that one woman who went through so much illness and misfortune could still look at life in such a positive manner. Readers you can't miss this.  This book is worth your time.	2001-10-25

Lucy West and Kate Cunningham have been friends for years and carry each other secrets.Their husbands have also become great friends along with their children; so one can imagine what their wonderful August vacations are like.  Through an inheritance of a home in Nantucket island from Lucy West's aunt, they are able to enjoy the sea, sun, sailing and relaxing, along with tasty meals of lobster and corn which they adore.<br />The characterisation is great.  Ms Thayer makes you feel like they are part of your family and you start to cherish and care for their lives.  But aren't these families a little too perfect? Some will say yes, other will say no; they are indeed families and friends like that.......perfect.<br />When you get into the story you will see how a fine friendship like theirs can sometimes turn awry over one brisk mistake; a slight brush with infidelity.  It's a short novel but worth it in many ways so I have given it five stars.  Thanks for your lovely book Nancy Thayer.<br />Nutface<br />October 22nd 2001	2001-10-22

With an indepth look at the cross, we see how much human Jesus was.....flesh and bones like you and me with the ability to feel the pain of the blows inflicted upon him. And being of human flesh, he still held compassion for those who pained him and scorned him, especially for one of the thieves next to him whom he promised paradise.  And he was in human flesh again when he looked upon his diciple John, whose eyes fell in line with the Saviour's feet, and asked him to please take care of his mother. And again in human flesh he suffered thirst  and then  finally  gave his spirit up to his Heavenly Father.<br />This book empathises that Jesus was very much in the human form  when he died on Calvary and that we should not forget.<br />The witnesses at the cross are all drawn into the story along with those who fled from the scene.  The serious feeling of having let the Saviour down was so strongly felt by his disciples, but when they gathered for comfort in the room where the Last Supper was served, there was a distinct feeling of deja vu.  Can you imagine how their hearts almost flew out of their skins when they saw their beloved Saviour standing before them?<br />This is just a taste of what Mr Lucado's book is about this time around, but you can get the story by ordering now. You'll love it.<br />Nutface<br />October 18th, 2001	2001-10-18

Set in the Southern state of Georgia, Siddons delves into the lives of three generations of women.<br /><br />The main character is Ruth Yancey, the daughter of impoverished and demented mill worker Cater.  Cater is an embarassment to his family and makes a spectacle of himself on market days as  he leads them shepherd-like into town, where he cusses and carries on any person he encounters who is better off financially than he.  Returning home in a drunken state he strips his wife Pearl Yancey and daughter Ruth of what little self esteem they have, with brutal beatings,horrible rapings and screams which can be heard far into the night.<br /><br />It isn't any wonder then that at such an early age, Ruth Yancey is forced to embrace the adoption offered by the seniors of Fox's Earth; Alicia and Claud Fox.  Pearl Yancey convinces Ruth that going there will be the answer to all her dreams and the end of her nightmares.  So they wait impatiently until Cater Yancey's death, and then Ruth is driven by Alicia Fox's chauffeur<br />to her new life.<br /><br />The story takes full swing from here with Alicia turning Ruth into the lady who should be readily accepted by society.  She learns all the social graces and proper etiquette, and all the finer things of life.  Soon Paul Fox, son of Fox's Earth takes her hand in marriage and she now feels more in control.<br /><br />See how quickly Ruth Yancey Fox forgets where she has arrived from, as she gains power over all her contacts by evil manipulations and such unpleasant dominance she lauds over all who live at the 'big house'including her husband and eventually the coming generations of Fox's children. It almost leaves you with your mouth open to see such ruthlessnes; for Ruth Yancey Fox rules, and she rules with a very long whip. A whip which leaves indelible marks.  A highly recommended saga from Siddons.<br /><br />Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE October 2nd, 2001)	2001-10-02

Set in Washington, this book is perfect for those suspense readers out there.<br />Lovely American journalist Dana Evans has just returned home from covering the war in Bosnia with her adopted twelve year old son Kemal. She has not settled in good before she understands that her good friend Gary Winthrop has been shot point blank when surprising burgulars intent on stealing his precious<br />artwork.<br />What seems suspicious in this case is that the burgulars did not<br />take the most expensive paintings, neither did they touch any of the jewellery or money in the house.<br />Dana decides that she must investigate what has happened to the Winthrops who were considered the equivalent of American royalty.<br />For isn't it strange that within one year five members of that family should loose their lives in a series of incidents? It started with Gary's parents whose deaths were caused when their house was burned to the ground as a result of an electrical fault. A couple months after their daughter Julia is taken to her death in a ski-ing accident followed closely by her brother Paul who was killed in a motor accident in France. What a coincidence and now her friend Gary!! No way was Dana Andrews taking this as coincidental and she decides to put her two big feet in. She sets off to Europe to do some investigations, leaving her adopted son in the charge of a baby sitter and her fiance Jeff, a sports caster to look after his ex wife who has become a victim of cancer. Dana plunges headlong into her investigation. In this cat and mouse game she confronts betrayal and horriffic shocks as she tries to outdo the group of men and women who are trying to stop her from learning anything about the Winthrop vendetta. This is Sidney Sheldon at his best. Highly recommended!!! Do not miss it.<br />Heather Marshall<br />September 24th, 2001	2001-09-24

I found it quite educational as it introduced me to South Carolina, a state I had never visited and felt a great urge to do so afterwards. It was also educational in inviting readers to see the holocaust from the point of view of suicide victim Shyla.<br />The main character Jack McCall has left his homeland of South Carolina with his young daughter Leah to flee the mental anguish he is suffering as a a result of the suicidal death of his beautiful wife Shyla. Shyla had thrown herself to her own death when life became too much for her.<br />Jack and Leah take to Rome where he spends his days in isolation writing cook books and trying to forget. However, after some time in Rome, it isn't long before his telephone is ringing and he is being begged to return to the USA. His mother Lucy has learnt that she has cancer, one of his brothers is giving trouble; all sorts of things are surfacing in the South, ready to<br />interrupt Jack's hibernation. His dysfuntional family needs him back there to straighten things out.....they cannot function without him.<br />With a great deal of relutance, Jack and his daughter Leah return home and the haunting horrors which he has tried so hard to black out, flood back into his memory; inviting sometimes short-lived humour, deep sadness, unfinished business and quite a lot of 'what ifs?'<br />The characters in this book are bright sparks and will stay with you forever, especially Jack's mother Lucy, his brothers, his father and his special school friend Jordan whose character you're bound to be facinated with along with so many others.<br />This novel is quite long but as the author unravels the cause of Shyla's suicide, you'll find yourself savouring the details which adds very much depth to the storyline. Another one of those books that I'll definitely be rereading. I only hope that Mr. Contoy has another spectacular one in the works for us soon, but in the meanwhile, you can dance to Beach Music which I highly recommend.

An invitation from Ginger Fowler who owns the beach house there, requests the company of Kate Abrams now a successful interior decorator, Cecie Hart, Kate's former best friend, and Fig Newton, who has become a romance novelist and photograher.<br />Kate Abrams is the main character in this book. Now married, Kate was a cancer victim but is now out of remission and is somewhat reluctant to reply when this invitation arrives.<br />Persuaded by her husband, she goes off to the Outer Banks through she knows that the man who has broke her heart years ago will most likely poke his head in one day.<br />Paul Sibley now married to Ginger Fowler was once Kate's sweetheart. Paul was once the love of her life whom he held in very high self esteem and respect. Imagine him betraying her with one of her own friends, for the sake of money alone!<br />Kate and Paul Silbey had planned a future together but those plans were not to be. Charismatic Sibley made sure of that by making the wrong move. As they meet at the Outer Banks, new cans of worms are opened and new stories imparted stemming back from their days at college which when revealed is enough to shock the socks off of their lovely feet. Forgiving Ginger Fowler was made easy this time for Kate, for Ginger once the big beautiful Amazon has lost her looks and has deteriorated badly due to her many overindulgences and the daily stress she now faces in her life.<br />But that's not all that Kate has to settle. She has it out with Fig; accusing her of a multitude of things she has done behind her back in the past and then there's Cecie her former best friend. Although she and Cecie Hart have been talking good and everything with each other and relating about thier lives apart, there is something rather remote and distant about her. However the crunch comes much later when Paul Sibley makes his appearance and all hell breaks loose. But......it's a long way before these days at the Outer Banks comes to a unsuspecting tragic halt.  The characters are brilliant and this is one of the books I'll be reading again in the near future.

Celia Lytton is the main character who takes over the helm of the family business as the country goes to war.  A strong-willed woman, Celia displays her good business acumen and makes Lyttons a successful and competitive establishment.  As the family men leave England to fight in the war, there are butterflies in the womens' stomachs each time as they worry if and whether they would ever see their loved ones again. There are powerful women in this book who take their responsibility, virtually heading their households, dispersing their children from London up to  country homes away from the bombs, and establishing temporary shelters for the the wounded men who return from the war in despair, and some total incapacitated.<br />As the novel weaves it's intoxicating magic, you will meet Oliver Lytton, Celia's kind husband who becomes a tiresome and tempermental soul much to Celia's agitation, causing her to look elsewhere for love.  You'll also meet Margaret Lytton, Oliver's sister who helps Celia manage the publishing house.

I have not read all of Mr. Lucado's books as yet, but this has to be one of his best. Max Lucado paints the early life of Christ on earth in the gospels in his gallery of stories  when our Saviour walked this earth in the flesh.  I felt God's love and presence so deeply as he performed his daily miracles, heal the sick turn water into wine, speak about grace, forgiveness, disappointments and even prayer.  I just could not help compare the biblical times to our present day situations, and I found myself doing this in all of the stories.  I can say without a doubt that the Holy Spirit has guided the author's hand throughout this book as I felt the power of God so stronly as I read.  This book challenges one to look at your life and examine it and see the way God has moved in your past as  a non-Christian until the present as a Christian.  He still moves stones every minute in our every day lives, and that's one reason we must exalt and praise His Holy Name.  Readers please buy this book and be inspired as I was.

If you cannot stand the heat, you know what to do.  In this piece, the Mulvaneys are a very happy close-knit, no secrets held, type of family.  There are Corinne and Michael Mulvaney the parents, and Marianne, Patrick and Judd the brothers.  The trouble starts with Marianne who is date raped on a Valentine date,and who falls into despair just having to tell her perfect family about her the horendous happening. She expects sympathy, but that's when the house falls down; for she gets not an ounce of comfort or anything of that sort. Then  her cowardly father send a message by his dear wife to inform the young lady that she has to leave his home.  Her brothers are torn and confused by these happenings, as all personalities make deperate changes and everyone totally isolates themselves from each other.  In the meanwhile Marianne drift from place to place, and life in the Mulvaney's house has come to a standstill. One cannot but help wondering why it is that the parents acting in such a unfeeling and callous way instead of being supportive of their daughter's dark fate.  Readers, that's how life is, and it shows that their foundation was terribly weak as a family.  A somewhat happy ending but this book takes a great deal of patience as it is quite long too, but it is very very real. That's the reason that I'm keeping mine safely in my library until I feel the need to reread it one day.  Give it a go and you'll see what I mean.

Lou and Oz appear as the main characters in this book though their little friend Diamond breaks my heart many times over in this tale.  Oz does too though in a different way, with his unstinting belief in his comatose mother awakening from her sleep, where she would be capable of loving him and his sister just as before.  Not wanting to give too much away to those who have not read this book as yet, let me say that for me it has been a breath of fresh air from the Virginian mountains.  I got to feel everything that those wonderful characters experienced, from the smell of the lovely mountain air, then the flowers, the food cooking, the earthly manure,even the dynamite....strong. David Baldacci definitely is on to a movie with this one.  Readers, buy this book today.....you won't be sorry. Thanks Mr Baldacci for a great read.	2001-06-12

Old Sins was my first reading by her and I throughly enjoyed the characters and the mystery attached.  Since then I've read all of her books and I'm now in the middle of her current one No Angel. Old Sins is one of her best.  Thnaks Ms. Vincenzi	2001-06-12

The Drifters definitely gives you a thirst for travel to those wonderful exotic places and I loved the atmosphere especially in Spain; you can actually feel the sun and everything.  The noise in the bars etc..you feel as though you're in it with them. oh boy......it was so exciting. The six main characters quite unlike each other at most, were very special in their own ways.  Monika was my favourite character. Readers don't lose out on this one; it's a must.	2001-06-12
US	47015427	R27LC7NLF97WB7	1561007013	450524513	Red Leaves	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Excellent To The Core	If you've read Tully and like it,then you'll definitely cherish this lovely book by Paullina Simons.  I like the way she gets her readers so emotionally involved with the characters.  These youngsters in Red Leaves, Kristina, Constance, Albert and Jim  felt like  my family, or they could have been my children for that matter.  I felt especially close to Kristina, the main character as I felt her pain and her cold lonliness.  With a cleverly crafted detective storyline, it has the capacity to keep you up all night long until you've turned the last page. After you've turned that last page, you can't get those characters out of your head.  If you haven't bought it yet........get it.......it's worth every penny.  Thanks Ms Simons	2001-06-12
