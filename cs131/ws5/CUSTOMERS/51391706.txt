This edition emphasizes the  importance of character building and morality rather than mere  entertainment. Presented in a schoolbook style, this text is a wonderful  book for adults as well, especially those concerned about the education of  their children. Be sure to read the Preface. Includes a lengthy  introduction to the life of Aesop.	1999-07-26

This fieldguide covers more topics and includes more photos than you might think. Everything from Astronomy to flora/fauna to geology, etc. Since the descriptions are short, but the photos are plentiful, it is a good book to  combine with the Handbook of Nature Study by Anna Botsford Comstock  (Cornell Univ. Press). Botsford's book is heavy on the descriptions, but  short on photos. With these two books, you have everything you need for a  comprehensive course on Natural History.	1999-07-06

The artwork is totally new age and reminds one more of unicorns and hippie art than classical Greek legends. Instead of  this dumbed-down version, I would recommend &quot;The Iliad of Homer  (Oxford Myths and Legends)&quot; by Barbara Leonie Picard and Joan  Kiddell-Monroe (Illustrator).

A professor at Cambridge University summed it up quite nicely. He notes, &quot;You could not memorize Fagles, or Lattimore - or Hobbes, a few phrases apart - while Pope, even at his least Homeric, is memorable.&quot;  Compare the following VERY BRIEF excerpts to see what I mean. Iliad xxii  (483ff.)<br />Robert Fagles:<br />The day that orphans a youngster cuts him off  from friends.  And he hangs his head low, humiliated in every way. . . his  cheeks streaked with tears.<br />Alexander Pope:<br />The Day, that to the Shades  the Father sends,<br />Robs the sad Orphan of his Father's Friends:<br />He,  wretched Outcast of Mankind! appears<br />For ever sad, for ever bath'd in  Tears;<br />Pope clearly conveys the emotion better, and as a poet rather than  an academic, he is probably closer to Homer's original, at least in style,  than most.  It is only too bad that this edition is not available in  hardcover, since I would like it to grace my library wall for years to  come. Also, I do not know how Penguin can justify such an exhorbitant price  for a paperback edition. Perhaps because it is the only edition currently  available by Pope.	1999-06-29

If you like the television series &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter  of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some  redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this  book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency.	1999-06-21

Here the old fathers (the Catholic Church) are persecuted by the  young (the Church of England) and the realm's most faithful daughter  (Cordelia) is sent into exile. A central point in the play is the fool's  prophesy when &quot;bawds and whores do churches build.&quot; The brutality  of Elizabeth's reign is very well portrayed in &quot;Cranmer's Godly  Order&quot; by Michael Davies and will provide great insight into the  environment that Shakespeare was living. Shakespeare's parents and best  friend suffered under this persecution and King Lear was written to  encourage recusant Catholics to be patient and persevere in the face of  hardship. &quot;The weight of this sad time we must obey.&quot; The failed  invasion of the French army parallels the failed invasion of the Spanish  Armada in its attempt to avenge the murder of Queen Mary.  Perhaps for  these reasons, King Lear's importance was downplayed for several hundred  years in Anglican England and only today it is recognized as Shakespeare's  greatest play.	1999-06-20

The publisher's claim that this was the Bible Shakespeare used is very hard to believe. Professor Peter Milward, who is an expert on Shakespeare, notes that Shakespeare &quot;died a Papist&quot;, having sent for a  Catholic priest to give him the last rites. Furthermore, &quot;It is clear  from his plays that he was against the strictures of Puritanism.&quot;  Professor Milward goes on to note, &quot;Shakespeare's theology and  philosophy do not significantly depart from his mediaeval inheritance, and  his plays are laced with references to contemporary Catholic writers of his  own time. In King Lear, in particular, Milward sees the dramatist in the  role of comforter of the afflicted Catholics of northern England who had  almost given up hope that the persecution would ever cease. He provides  evidence that Catholic recusant actors performed the play in the houses of  the Catholic gentry in the north for precisely these reasons.&quot;  Shakespeare was certainly aware that Catholics were being murdered and  persecuted by Calvinists on the continent since it is believed he spent  some time there in a Catholic seminary. All considered, it is doubtful that  Shakespeare would have endorsed this version, so neither shall I.	1999-06-10

What other textbook can be used with equal  effectiveness in both kindergarten and high school? Lessons are short and  easy to follow. It covers almost everything including agriculture,  wildlife, geology, astronomy, etc. Marine life and oceanography are not  included. Some minor flaws. For example, the author confuses selective  breeding with evolution theory. However, such flaws can be overlooked and  they do not detract from the value of the lessons.	1999-06-10

Many people mistakenly believe that this is the first English bible in print. However, there are other versions, such as the Douay-Rheims Bible, that pre-date the KJV by decades. In fact, the Douay-Rheims Bible used more  ancient manuscripts for translation and is therefore more accurate. Some  people may also find the introduction and other notes of this edition  offensive since it spews with hatred towards non-Anglican Christians who  had to live in hiding or risk torture or execution. These are the same  Anglicans that burned religious books and destroyed many beautiful  churches. For a full understanding of why this edition is so offensive, see  Cramer's Godly Order, by Michael Davies.	1999-06-09

It will also help Children to become accustomed to the  language of great literature at an early age. The reading level is suitable  for ages 7 or 8+, but younger children will certainly enjoy having these  stories read to them, although the themes in some of these stories are  clearly oriented to children of greater maturity. Simply use your  discretion when deciding which of the many stories to read to your young  children.	1999-06-07

It is clearly aimed at young adults who already have an understanding of the basic truths of the  Catholic faith. These catechisms are styled after Thomas Aquinas' Summa  Theologiae, which is universally recognized as one of the greatest  philosphical and theological works ever!

Yet it is the introduction that I  found most helpful in solidifying my concept of the philosophy of Classical  Education in general, and homeschooling in particular. One caution however.  The book includes an article on what NOT to do in an appendix at the end.  This really should have followed immediately after the introduction since  the advice is very important.

This program is a back-to-basics reading and writing course for ages 4-8 years. You do not need any computer programs, glitzy  readers, or workbooks, just paper and a pencil. The only reason I didn't  give this book five stars is that the recording that comes with it is on an  old-fashioned record, and so far I cannot find anywhere to play it.

His so called &quot;incisive and witty commentary&quot; adds nothing to the value of the text, and is more a  distraction than anything else. Some of his comments border on ridiculous.  I would have liked to have seen more explanation of the meaning behind each  of Washington's precepts, rather than Brookhiser's unsuccessful attempt at  humor. Still, in today's world more than ever before, we need guidance on  how to behave in public. The handy pocket size format of the book allows it  to be carried on the person and used as a constant reminder of how to act  towards others. Washington put these rules to action throughout his life,  and they apparently served him well. If it were not for the commentary, I  would give it five stars.	1999-05-07
