Seductive Poison is a deep and insightful historical  document loaded with fascinating and pertinent information on cults.  More  like a novel than an autobiography I found it to be a mystery, thriller and  spiritual journey.  It is an all night reader, almost impossible to put  down.	2000-07-14

Seducitve Poison, a memoir of a Jonestown survivor whose  mother's passing as white and not a German Jew (and keeping it a secret  from her children) pushed both mother and daughter into another deceitful  world. Although seemingly at odds both reveal the perils in persuing such a  scam and all its tragic ramifications.  Both are riveting and well written.	2000-05-16

And here I thought I was absolutely and in every way different from those odd-ball folks in Jim Jones group.  That's why it came as such an abrupt  and rude awakening to see just how close I resembled these folks; how many  similarities exist in my life, from childhood, the bible pounding  upbringing, our god fearing trek through hell while searching for  redemption. I recognized this story in my families experiences.  I could  have gone the same direction, down the same path.<br />Walk a mile, a year, or  easier yet, take an enlightening journey down Deborah Layton's path, into a  world of seduction, betrayal, poison and finally redemption.  The message I  took away from this book is worth the night fright and chills I had to  combat until Deborah escaped. This is every man's fear, getting caught-up  in something we realize has gone bad. Herein lies God's truth: WE ARE ALL  cut from the same cloth, have the same insecurites, fears, hopes and  dreams.  What this story teaches is that we must all be vigilant against  the devil who dresses in sheeps clothing, says all the right things and  then promises us the pot of gold at the far end of the rainbow. Oh yeah,  and don't plan on wearing Penny Loafers on this trip!	2000-05-03

As a college student I see a frightening  proliferation of fringe groups on campus whose sole purpose is to lure us  into their way of thinking.  When Deborah Layton spoke at my school  recently I was struck by how much freedom we take for granted: to think and  do as we please, as long as no one is hurt, and how all of that was denied  the members of Jim Jones group by his totalitarianism state. There are  lessons to be learned by reading this book.  I hope it does well.  Layton  was brave to escape and shows even more courage by stepping onto a campus  like mine, where so many of us believe it could never happen to us, and  tell her story.  It has made me think twice about the choices I make.  What  she explains so well is how innocence and ignorance combined can be deadly.	2000-04-30

From then on, the reader lives the life the author experienced, as we detour from the  lighted path into the darkened cavern where Hope is crushed and fear and  madness reign.   We believe that it &quot;just can't happen again,&quot;  but it has and does again and again, in Europe with Hitler, China with Mao,  Russia with Stalin and continues now in smaller ways, infringe groups, like  the Freeman in Montana, Ruby Ridge, Oklahoma, Waco and San Diego.   Unfortunately, there will be more tragedies as the millennium comes to a  close unless we stop and listen to someone who knows.  Layton's book-- by  allowing us access into the world of devotion, loyalty to one master, the  darkness of self righteous deceit-- gives the reader insight into the world  of Absolute Power and how it corrupts.  Few people have the strenghth and  courage to escape which makes this book that much more imperitive to read,  so that you and I will listen to their warnings when they do.	2000-03-27

This is one of those extraordinary storys.  I am an avid reader, love the classics, sometimes  peruse the mind candy, and appreciate honesty in the protagonist's voice.  In all my readings I have never felt as though I  left this  world and  entered another.  Other peoples reviews of this book have mentioned this  same experience, the sense of disbelief and yet a glimpse of understanding.  What I loved most is the author never once tried to defend her actions and  perhaps because of that I became her cheerleader, supporter, and armchair  godparent--praying that she would make it out of the devils playground. I  knew she escaped and wrote the book, but there were many times in the  reading that I believed she'd fail.  Seductive Poison is deeply affecting  and a terribly important historical document which should be read so we may  someday understand a soceital phenomenon that we haven't yet come to grips  with yet.	2000-03-15

We yearn for meaning in our lives, we dream of what can be and we  sometimes make mistakes.  To say that those who joined the Jim Jones  movement made a mistake would be to minimize the enormity of the event, but  to see where in each of our owns lives we have experienced the same fears,  hopes and beliefs then and only then can we understand how such a tragedy  could have happened.  This book does not explain everything--how could  it--yet it brings to life the human condition--to search, live and learn.	2000-03-10

For it is only child's play. If only Deborah and her mother could  have known the calamity that awaited them further down their fairy tale  path. There are lessons to be learned in this honest telling of a family  pulled apart and almost destroyed.   Deborah, with all her vital hopes and  vibrant dreams betrayed shines through to the end--her mothers and fathers  brave little warrior. Once lost--now found.  God bless.	2000-03-08

I was  astounded when one of the men in my book group brought along his favorite  book and this woman, the same one I see everyday was looking out from the  cover of the book in his hands. At first I felt like a voyeur--reading her  very personal story and then seeing and hearing her order her cappaccino in  the morning.  I have always assumed that she was just another normal  somebody--but to think she has been through such a shocking history and  remains friendly and accessible--has really affected me.  I'm not sure why  really.  Perhaps its becuase I assumed anyone who could have joined that  group had to be deranged, demented and, I thought all were deceased! I am  ashamed of how I conceitedly viewed them (and her) as different than me! I  hope to gain the courage to approach her and apologize for my misconception  of her and the wonderful and unforgettable characters she writes about in  her book and then lost in Jonestown.  Because of the present tense style of  the book I was able to identify with  and get to know some memorable and  influencial people in her life like the old black woman, Mary,  The-Sorceress-Chef; Teresa, her mentor; the handsome Jonestown crew chief  Lee, who tried to help her; the bungling and idiotic Embassy staff who  'didn't get it'; and her sweet and tragic mother, Lisa, whom she left  behind. It is miraculous the author is alive and sane today.  That she  could write such a wonderful, revealing and exceptional book is nothing  less than a miracle. This book is a testament to the power of man's  survival instinct and the courage of one woman, at great risk to herself,  to tell this story with all its warts and festering wounds.   It is the  most affecting book I have ever read.	2000-02-05

I was riveted from the beginning Introduction by the Washington Post journalist and occasional corresponedent of the NPR NewsHour, Charles Krause, who WAS THERE at the END of the massacre.  He  sets the tone and historical importance of this autobiography by Layton who  joined Jim Jones' group as a young girl.<br />Deborah Layton's memory and  ability to tell this story in such a AS IT IS HAPPENEING intensity is both  transcending, thrilling and breath-taking. Our children, who are the  targets of groups like the Jonestown Cult, should be required to read this.  Seducitve Poison gave me insights I never thought possible into one of the  strangest and frightening groups of the 20th Century.   Much like the theme  of the academic work, &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners&quot;, Layton  shows how ultimate power and peer pressure can consume even the best of us  and turn us into blind, god-fearing savages.  It took great courage for  Layton to tell her horrendous story without ever asking for pity or  forgiveness.  Unlike so many Tell All books, this memoir is not self  serving nor does she point the finger at everyone else, and try to excuse  herself. Layton's life story is an educational, heartrendering and  refreshing breath of frigid air.	2000-01-27

I had always wondered what had happened and why.  This book explained it  to me and gave me much more: 1. an understanding of how 2. a grasp of why  3. a belief that we should not jump to conclusions about other poeples  lives so quickly 4. a respect for those courageous enough to come forward  and tell their story. I am deeply appreciative of Deborah Layton's belief  that her life's story was one that needed to to heard.  It is a very sad  story, but at least she did make it out and lived long enough to become  strong enough to write it down for her daughter's sake.  I hope I get the  chance to meet the author someday and get her to sign my book.	2000-01-08
