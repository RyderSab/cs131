I just got done reading the paperback version of this book and it's a hoot. Highly recommended. In short, it's a hilarious (and often melancholy) autobiography about the author who's a classic underachiever, drifting through life by drinking, (trying) to get laid and playing the drums. When that doesn't work out, he goes back to college and gets an english lit. degree. In the end, Magnuson finally finds his place in the world through self-acceptance and love. It's also a very pointed critique of those (your basic \\"politically correct\\" types) who engage in the very same stereotyping (this time - of the male lummox) that the lummox is so often accused of doing. Like Jim Goad's \\"Redneck Manifesto,\\" the moral of the story may well be that stereotyping is inaccurate, and therefore dangerous, whether it comes from the left or the right.<br />And if that doesn't pique your interest in reading this book, then read it because, to use Magnuson's words, it \\"kicks bum!\\"	2003-08-06

This is a great, must-have book that provides the definitive overview of Big Daddy's art and more general contribution to pop culture.  Unlike \\"Ed Big Daddy Roth: His Life, Times, Cars, and Art\\" by Pat Ganahl (which is also great), this book focuses more on Roth's art rather than his car creations (although there are quite a few photos of the cars too).  The book is divided into chapters focusing on different aspects of his art like the Rat Fink model kits he designed for Revell, t-shirt art, comic book art, vintage decals, etc.  Each Chapter is written by a different author (including many lowbrow artists like Robert Williams, Dave \\"DB\\" Burke, and the Pizz) who discuss how Big Daddy influenced their childhood and artistic career as well as his overall impact on pop culture.  While the claim made by the book that Roth was the greatest artist of the 20th century may be a bit of an overstatement, his influence on boys (mostly) who grew up during the 60's and 70's can hardly be overstated.<br />There's also plenty of interesting biographical info here including how Big Daddy's appropriation of outlaw symbols in the late 6o's, like the maltese cross and swastika, resulted in a commercial backlash against him (not unlike The Ramones who did the same thing and suffered similar criticism).  <br />In short, this is a must own book whether you're a fan of hot rod culture, lowbrow art or pop culture in general.  The book cover done up to look like the box from an old Revell Rat Fink model kit is a nice touch by the publisher, Last Gasp.<br />Most cool!!!!!!!!!	2003-07-31

This a great travel guide whether you're a tiki lounge aficionado or a fan of venacular, roadside attractions from days gone by. This is an extremely comprehensive book that is conveniently organized by state - describing every tiki bar (and related attractions like tiki motels) in each of the 50 states. The author also lists the address of famous tiki attractions no longer in existence. Both authentic and retro tiki attractions are listed and described by the author.<br />The listings are very thorough including descriptions of decor, food and drinks as well as photos of many interiors of the listed tiki bars. There are also international listings to help you find tiki bars around the world. And, if that weren't enough, there's a helpful glossary of tiki terms in the back of the book along recipes for exotic drinks.<br />This is one of the better, easier to use guide books I've come across - regardless of subject matter. <br />Hats off to James Teitelbaum - you'll find this a great, informative book no matter where you live (indeed, I found out about a great tiki bar in my home state that I didn't even know existed!).<br />Outstanding!	2003-04-23

As a long time collector of Japanese vinyl monster toys, I'm so glad that we finally have a domestically published book for stateside collectors (until this great book was published, we collector-types had to rely on expensive and hard to find Japanese import books as reference tools).  <br />This book is beautifully put together by Jimbo Matison and follows the format of many of the Japanese toy collector books, i.e. each page consists of a single photograph of a toy placed in a fantasy setting (similar in format to the book on vinyl toys available from the Marusan USA website) with a \\"key\\" at the back of the book that gives the name of the toy, date of production, manufacturer information, etc.  <br />Rather than a comprehensive collector's guide that tries to list every vinyl toy ever made (like Sean Linkenbach's Godzilla collectibles book), this book takes a selective approach to showing these toys.  There are \\"chapters\\" organized according to genre of toys (heroes, monsters, female characters, vehicles, etc.) with a sampling of both vintage and new toys in each category.  This is not a price guide, rather, the toys are photographed and presented for their design and artistic appeal. There's a nice combination of toys from vintage manufacturers such as Bullmark and Marusan as well as modern companies like M-1 and Marmit.<br />The only criticism I have is that I wish the book showed more toys!  On balance, this is a beautiful, large format book with page after page of beautifully photgraphed japanese vinyl toys.  You'll love this book whether you collect these toys or are just interested in their aesthetic appeal.<br />Nice work Jimbo!	2003-04-22

Whether you're thinking about getting into \\"the life,\\" or just want to be more successful \\"steppin' to the ladies,\\" this book has some very helpful advice.  The author lays it out for you with step-by-step advice on how to tighten your game and become a true pimp.

As a result, \\"The Pimp Game\\" is helpful not only to aspiring pimps and macks, but even squares and \\"tricks.\\"<br />As Iceberg Slim once said:  \\"If you're not in control of the game, you're being \\"played.\\"<br />Buy this book and find out why.	2002-12-17

Learn about the importance of having confidence in yourself to achieving true Mack-dom and that to play the game, it's best to comport yourself with honesty.<br />In short, the author provides straight-forward, easy to follow advice on how to transform yourself from a \\"square\\" to a \\"Mack\\" and have more success \\"steppin' to the ladies.\\"<br />Highly recommended!	2002-12-17

This book is a private publication (i.e. self-publication) put out with obvious care by St. John Morton.  Apparently, it's available in 3 forms (the least expensive being the hard cover edition, another edition with a leather spine and slip cover and the third, most expensive edition which has a full leather cover).  I bought the leather spined, slip covered edition which is hand signed and numbered by the author.<br />The downside to this book is that most of the photos of Von Dutch's pinstriping, paintings and custom car work have already appeared in the Last Gasp publication \\"Kustom Kulture.\\"  There are, however, a few new pieces in this book.  The other downside is that some of the images look like very high quality photocopies of images published elsewhere.  As long as you understand that this is a private pressing book, I think you'll be very happy with it.  Again, it's obvious that the author devoted loving attention to the creation of this book.  And, to date, it's the most comprehensive review of Von Dutch's work available.<br />Definitely worth owning.	2002-10-27

This was James Stewart's first book which portended the talent that would give us \\"Den of Thieves\\" and \\"Blood Sport,\\" among others.  Mr. Stewart is a great story teller - he can make a seemingly mundane subject into a real page-turner. The Partners offers fascinating insight into the rarified world of white-shoe New York law firms.  Especially interesting is the story of Cravath, Swain and Moore - where attorneys work 10 years without a day of vacation and one attorney gets passed over for partnership because he rode a motorcycle to work.  Yikes!<br />I haven't yet read the new James Stewart book about 9/11 but all of the others are very interesting, fair balanced accounts of the chosen subject matter.  Highly recommended.	2002-10-21

The chapter discussing Rudy Giuliani's tenure in the justice department during the Reagan administration (written long before he became mayor of NYC) is particularly interesting because it portrays him in a very unflattering light. An entirely different perspective on the man the country has come to love after 9/11.<br />Anything by James Stewart is worth reading.	2002-10-20
