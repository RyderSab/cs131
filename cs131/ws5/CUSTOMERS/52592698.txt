Although Newton clearly believes that the prosecution's psychiatrists were biased against Hickman, he in no way suggests that Hickman was anything other than a twisted, arrogant, and reckless psychopath. The background involving Hickman's family lasts only one chapter and is obviously relevant to the case.<br /><br />Newton did his homework, drawing on trial transcripts to give us a thorough review of this shocking homicide. The only thing that surprised me was that he does not seem to have read In Defense of the Fox, a memoir by Hickman's attorney, which would have shed additional light on the topic. Still, I think anyone who enjoys reading about crime, punishment, and old-time Hollywood will be rewarded by this book.	2005-06-08

Yes, there are some problems. The first third of the book is a bit slow. The dialogue is often curiously devoid of contractions. And I could have done without the self-conscious reference to Void Moon, an earlier Connelly book also referenced in The Narrows. But overall, this is a solid, well-researched, intelligently plotted mystery that puts Bosch back in his element and reminds us why we like him so much. If you're a fan of the series, don't miss The Closers.	2005-06-05

The writing style is sometimes ponderous, at other times diffuse. I was glad to learn I wasn't the only one who had trouble finding my way through Griffith-Jones' often vaporous exposition, which is not made any easier to navigate by his decision to rename most of the books of the Bible (Genesis = The Beginning; Exodus = The Escape; The Acts of the Apostles = The Mission; etc.).

But it's the later chapters that drag this book down into 2-star territory, as Atwater blends UFOs, alien abductions, genetic modification, folklore, channeling, and wacky predictions in a fruity melange of New Age craziness. Here's a typical quote:<br /><br />\\"A contemporary voice on the subject of the new race aborning in our time is Gordon-Michael Scallion. He is known as an intuitive futurist and modern-day prophet ... It was he who several years ago affirmed that the fifth root race [i.e., the alleged next phase of human evolution] is the blue race and linked it with the then soon-to-appear blue star, which he later identified as the comet Hale-Bopp. He associated the manifestation of both of these developments with Christian beliefs about the Second Coming of Christ, and also with the Native American prophesy of the White Buffalo and the portentous 1994 birth, in Jamesville, Wisconsin, of an all-white female buffalo calf ...\\" (pp. 211-212)<br /><br />Scallion goes on to establish his prophetic bona fides by predicting that \\"between 1998 and 2001, everyone with eyes to see and ears to hear will experience a spiritual event that parallels the event that occurred two thousand years ago\\" (i.e., the birth of Christ). Well, it's 2005, and if it happened, I missed it. But maybe I lacked eyes to see and ears to hear.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I think near-death experiences, when properly researched, provide compelling evidence of life after death. But Atwater's silly book cheapens the field and undercuts the serious work done by others. Read it for amusement only.	2005-01-14

Dr. Guillen, a bona fide \\"smart person\\" with PhDs in math, physics, and astronomy, writes without rancor and does his best to see the debate from both sides. His basic point is that the world needs more people who combine IQ and SQ (i.e., logic and intuition, left brain and right brain, intellectualism and spirituality). He shows that while science and religion are different disciplines bound by different rules, they can complement each other, with science providing the data and religion providing the meaning.  <br /> <br />The book is slightly undermined by some shoddy proof-reading, by a few errors of fact (e.g., Samuel Butler lived in the 19th century, not the 17th), and by the author's narrow focus on Christianity as almost synonymous with religion. Although he acknowledges other faiths, nearly every example of spirituality Dr. Guillen cites is taken from the Bible. His Christian focus is particularly evident in a twenty-question \\"SQ test\\" at the end of the book, in which answers consistent with Christian thinking are always scored highest, even when other answers might be equally \\"spiritual\\" when judged by alternate traditions.  <br /> <br />Still, in the end the book answers its own question most convincingly. Yes, a smart person can believe in God, and need make no apologies for doing so.  <br /> <br />For a lengthier and more technical treatment of similar ideas, consider Barr's \\"Modern Physics and Ancient Faith.\\"	2004-10-01

Readers expecting the inside story on the translation may be disappointed; &quot;God's Secretaries&quot; is more of a general overview of the period, with deft character sketches of the principal translators. This is unavoidable, since most of the documents relating to the day-to-day work of the translators have been lost. What the book lacks in detail, it compensates for with strong storytelling and a fine sense of history. <br />Even though I enjoyed the book, Nicolson did not convince me that the translators added very much to the work of William Tyndale, the martyred 16th-century translator; nor did he convince me that the King James Bible remains the best available translation. At the end of the book, Nicolson quotes a few beautiful verses from Psalm 77 to demonstrate the superiority of the KJV. But other lines from the same psalm are either mistranslated or obscure. Here they are, with comparisons from more recent translations: <br />KJV - my sore ran in the night and ceased not<BR>NEW KING JAMES VERSION - my hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing<br />KJV - thou holdest mine eyes waking<BR>NEW REVISED STANDARD VERSION - you keep my eyelids from closing<br />KJV - I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High<BR>NEW AMERICAN BIBLE - my sorrow is this, the right hand of the Most High has left us<br />The King James Bible was great in its day, but newer translations are more accurate and more intelligible.

Lots of preproduction sketches and storyboard art, photos of models and miniatures, a reasonable amount of technical detail, and a much more revealing, personal tone than we have heard from Ray before. (But, ever the gentleman, he simply omits mention of any people he disagreed with - like the clueless director of VALLEY OF GWANGI who, rumor has it, tried to get Ray fired from the film! Neither the director's name nor the rumor appears in the text.) There is a respectable number of color photos and a huge assortment of black and white pix, all very well reproduced. Particularly interesting is a section at the end summarizing all the various projects that never made it past the development stage - and there were a lot! Also fascinating is the discussion of how the storylines of the movies changed dramatically through various drafts of the scripts. Giant rats in 7th VOYAGE OF SINBAD? A Valley of Vipers in a later Sinbad movie? (Producer Charles Schneer nixed both concepts, the latter because of &quot;some extraordinary idea that it would frighten pregnant women,&quot; according to Ray.) My only gripe, and it is minor, is that some of the photos are very, very small. There's a shot of the clay sculture of a Sphinx modeled for the unmade FORCE OF THE TROJANS that is about the size of a postage stamp! Larger would be better, but I can't quibble much with a book that covers so much territory and gives us a glimpse of an era and style of filmmaking that will never be repeated. For those who cherish the hand-crafted excellence of Harryhausen's work, this is a must-buy, and a huge improvement over his much less comprehensive FILM FANTASY SCRAPBOOK.	2004-03-26

For pure entertainment value, I would give it only three. So I've split the difference. <br />It's impossible to deny the hard work and exhaustive research that went into this densely argued book. Nicholl discovered previously unknown tidbits of fact about Marlowe and other Elizabethan figures (and he is not shy about announcing his role in these discoveries). Unfortunately, the sheer number of digressions into the minutiae of Elizabethan spycraft began to wear on me after a while. At one point Nicholl himself admits that a certain story he is recounting is &quot;wearyingly familiar,&quot; as indeed it is - we've read it all before, again and again, in the lives of various minor poets and sometime spies reconstructed throughout the book. Some of these folks are directly connected with Marlowe, some have only the most tangential relationship, and others are dragged in just for atmosphere. An examination of the events in Deptford that left Marlowe dead occupies the first and last sections of THE RECKONING, but the long middle portion is devoted to establishing the background of the killing - a background that seemingly incorporates every single fact Nicholl was able to dig up during months or years of poring through archival documents. It can be &quot;wearying&quot; indeed, not to mention mind-numbing. Still, there is important information here for those interested in the period. Just don't expect a quick or easy read.	2004-02-25

The resulting phenomena included moving lights with no apparent source, \\"apports\\" (materializations) of odd items, the touches of unseen hands, disembodied voices, and eventually images recorded on photographic film and videotape. It's hard not to be skeptical when reading the early stages of this book - the claims sound wild, some of the \\"spirit communications\\" are rather puerile, and the experimental controls were, at first, minimal. Later, however, seasoned investigators of the paranormal were invited to observe the seances and take precautions against fraud. The phenomena persisted. The group even met in other locations, sometimes in other countries, and continued to produce results. While critics will go on crying fraud, it is hard to believe that such remarkably varied and carefully documented effects could have been fraudulently produced for so many years, in so many different venues, under the watchful eyes of so many different observers, without detection. On the other hand, it's also hard to believe that such fantastic claims could be true, especially since the phenomena abruptly ceased for reasons that remain cryptic. The Solomons do a careful and serious job of presenting the facts and the arguments, both pro and con, and their book includes numerous photos, many in color. THE SCOLE EXPERIMENT caused a sensation in England and is finally available in the US. It should be read by anyone with a serious interest in the paranormal.	2003-11-09

His book is technical and can be difficult at times, but it is still worthwhile for anyone seeking an honest, thorough analysis of Objectivism. One reader called it a &quot;screed,&quot; which is unfair - Ryan's tone is measured and serious, and he shows emotion only toward the end, when he gives his personal feelings about the psychological harm Rand can do to her followers. Other readers claim that Ryan is misinterpreting Rand by viewing her theories through an Idealist lens, but this is incorrect. Ryan simply points out, in detail, that Rand's epistemology is an incoherent mixture of Empiricism and Idealism. His criticisms are valid whether or not you agree with the alternative perspective he offers. I would recommend this book, as well as a critique from an Empiricist perspective, Gregory S. Nyquist's &quot;Ayn Rand Contra Human Nature.&quot;	2003-08-15

The book simply does not provide enough documentation for its claims. Many of the stories seem to rest on the slenderest foundations. For instance, the authors recount a tale of George Washington encountering a ghost - or angel - at Valley Forge in 1778. This lengthy, detailed narrative, written in a pseudo-Biblical style, is attributed to Washington himself. However, we then learn that Washington didn't write it, after all - it was written up by a &quot;young aide, Anthony Sherman, who many years later, in 1859, retold the account&quot; to a reporter. So what we have is a second-hand story circulated 81 years after the alleged event (and bearing obvious references to the Civil War - astoundingly prophetic in 1778, but not so remarkable in 1859, when the war was imminent). Things get worse as the book continues. Nostradamus is dragged into the discussion. We hear of a ghost story reported by &quot;an unnamed source&quot; in &quot;a national tabloid.&quot; The Bible Code makes an appearance. All credibility is lost. In the Foreword, Joel Martin says, &quot;We wanted this book to be more than merely a collection of anecdotes.&quot; They failed.	2003-05-11

My conscious mind feeds them to me in a linear sequence strung out with a bunch of other moments in an illusion of a continuous flow of action.&quot; (p. 340, trade paperback edition) Barbour comments that this reader's views are &quot;often very close to my own position.&quot;<br />I see two problems here. First, the hypothesis seems essentially solipsistic - it's not clear if it can ever be tested, proved, or disproved. Second, how can &quot;my conscious mind feed these moments to me&quot; in a world of total stasis, a world where everything is frozen and motionless? Either consciousness itself is exempt from the timelessness of the rest of the system (but Barbour seems to think it isn't) or consciousness, being part of a timeless reality, is frozen and unable to engage in any processes - including the process of &quot;feeding&quot; moments to me. In other words, if time is an illusion created by a filmstrip of single frames being run in our heads, then what is running the movie, and how can the movie run at all when nothing can move? <br />The theory seems to raise more questions than it answers. Still, questions are always valuable, so - three stars!	2003-05-11

His style is readable and brisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no evidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main researchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than serious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when he casually declares that the history of the human race can be understood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the writings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF THE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be persuaded by von Daniken's pop-culture writings, he will probably believe just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone pervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is coming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who spread their message. You'll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM enjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince no one who isn't already a believer.	2003-04-06

Scott Rogo was one of the most prolific writers on paranormal phenomena, and also one of the few who did the legwork to check out the facts on his own. Although his writing is sometimes a little sloppy (subject-verb agreement seems to be a problem), his thinking is always clear and sensible. Far from being a true believer, Rogo takes skeptical objections seriously, sometimes accepting their validity, at other times debunking the debunkers by looking more closely into their assertions. (His research into the much-maligned &quot;counting horse,&quot; Clever Hans, is fascinating, and his demolition of magician James Randi's unfounded attacks on parapsychologists Puthoff and Targ is invaluable. Both subjects are covered in the book's last chapter, &quot;The Failure of Skepticism.&quot;) Rogo looks at the so-called Mars Effect, ESP in animals and humans, afterlife and reincarnation evidence (and its weaknesses), shamanism, and other issues in this fast-paced, compact survey of the field.

Unfortunately, much of the book is concerned with tedious and irrelevant minutiae. Hall spends many pages trying to prove that Home invented his middle name (Dunglas) in order to fake a connection with Scottish nobility that allowed him to advance in European high society. Even if true, this says little about Home's purported mediumistic abilities. A later discussion of the publication date of an obscure book brought out by Home in 1869 or 1870 goes on for multiple chapters and succeeds in establishing that 1869, not 1870, may be the correct date. So what? Hall makes no attempt to deal with the bulk of Home's alleged phenomena, ascribing the hundreds of eyewitness reports to group hallucination or collective hypnosis. He does not discuss Sir William Crookes' controlled experiments with Home, carried out in good light and in the presence of various witnesses. He does expend a great deal of energy on Home's purported levitation in front of three young friends, under non-controlled conditions, in the dark. This is one of the weakest cases, and serves as a straw man by which Hall can profess to have discredited all the stronger cases without actually addressing them. He does, however, succeed in casting great doubt on the alleged levitation, for what that is worth. A much more complete analysis of Home is found in Stephen E. Braude's \\"The Limits of Influence,\\" now out of print but worth tracking down. Braude's detailed and careful approach makes Hall seem sloppy and disingenuous by comparison.	2003-03-08

Allegedly he visited realms of existence to which the rest of us will relocate after we die. Trouble is, his accounts differ markedly from those of people with near-dear experiences and from mediumistic information. So whom to believe? Well, the NDEs and the channeled info can at least be verified in certain ways - for instance, if an NDE involves an observation of medical procedures that are later confirmed, or if the medium brings through information about this world that there is no normal way of knowing, then we may perhaps be justified in accepting the rest of the account as trustworthy. Leland's dreams offer no such objectively testable content, so we have to take them on faith. <br />The author does try to substantiate his views by comparing them with ancient writings on the afterlife and with some NDE accounts, but it's not clear whether his knowledge of these matters may have influenced his dreams in the first place. I also had a great deal of trouble believing that Leland could remember his dreams/travels in such exhaustive detail; he recounts long conversations, which go on for pages, with otherworldly beings called Facilitators. This material reads like fiction or, at the very least, like a highly embellished account of a dream. <br />On the plus side, the book is well written and presents interesting summaries of esoteric material from many cultures. I just don't buy into Leland's astral traveling.	2003-02-05

Cornwell's evidence is circumstantial and speculative, certainly not enough to convict Walter Sickert either in 1889 or today. What I found more objectionable about \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" were the endless, repetitive descriptions of life in Victorian slums - befouled water, tainted food, horrible diseases, unsanitary hospitals, filth everywhere, nauseating odors, rampant alcoholism, etc., etc. Yes, we get it - life was bad! How much of this does the average person really want to read? Just when we think we're finally done with these long descriptive passages, more of them turn up. For me, at least, it was a case of authorial overkill. These bleak and morbid details, combined with Cornwell's claim that writing this book threatened to \\"ruin\\" her life, actually made me wonder if she is suffering from depression. This is no joke - the book reads as if written by a severely depressed person. Certainly any reader of this book is likely to come away from it feeling depressed - but probably not convinced.	2002-12-19

The book suffers, however, from a few flaws. First, it would have benefited from better proof-reading and copy-editing; the text contains quite a few errors of syntax and punctuation. Second, Stevenson does not deal with some of the more persuasive arguments in favor of the \\"pious fraud\\" theory, especially the impressive photonegative image produced by Nicholas Allen, an image that has most of the characteristics of the Shroud and was produced using materials available in the Middle Ages. (Whether or not the know-how to use those materials was available at that time is another question.) Third, the last part of the book contains some Christian apologetics that undermine the dispassionate tone Stevenson is striving for. The apologetics also call the author's objectivity into some doubt; he says, for instance, that there is strong extrabiblical evidence for the Resurrection, a dubious claim that makes one wonder how loosely he defines \\"evidence.\\" Personally, I would recommend Ian Wilson's \\"The Blood and the Shroud\\" over this book; Wilson is a much more polished writer, and his overview is more complete and, I think, more evenhanded. Stevenson's book does have the advantage of being slightly more recent, and Stevenson's \\"insider\\" status on the STURP team may make his views more authoritative.	2002-12-12

The trouble is, the phenomena themselves don't seem all that impressive. If you doubt this, just go to the author's Web site (look up his name on a search engine and you'll get there) and play the WAV files of EVP he's captured. I think you'll find, as I did, that the &quot;speech&quot; he's recorded sounds more like random noise. The brain has a tendency to find patterns where none exist - we look at the moon and see a face, or hear some white noise and imagine a few scattered words. Unless EVP (and related phenomena, like video images) can be captured in a less ambiguous form, they will never be very persuasive. Incidentally, I was a little surprised by Konstantinos' diatribe against mediums at the start of his book. He ridicules the idea that the dead could be waiting in a TV studio to speak with their loved ones - but later on, he tells us that EVP researchers can pick up thousands of voices. If the dead are eager to cluster around Konstantinos' microphone, why wouldn't they be equally quick to drop in on John Edward's &quot;Crossing Over&quot; studio? Personally, I find mediumship, when it produces verifiable messages under controlled conditions, to be much more convincing than the screechy noises captured by EVP.	2002-09-01

I got about a third of the way through JACK & JILL before giving up on the pointless, plotless story. This is the third Patterson book I've tried to read, and I have never finished any of them. At first I thought I'd just picked one of his weaker efforts. Now I'm convinced that they are ALL weak efforts. Which raises the question: Why is this guy so darn popular? I just don't get it. Patterson shows no interest in characterization, his plots consist mainly of violent death scenes loosely strung together, and worst of all, he writes at a seventh-grade level. I've read children's books  that are considerably more sophisticated than anything Patterson has written. There are dozens of suspense writers who outdistance Patterson in every aspect of his craft.	2002-02-10

The bulk of the book consists of Friedman's translation of the passages he ascribes to J, which fit together into a reasonably coherent narrative. I'm not sure I'm convinced, though. The established J material includes talking animals (the serpent in the garden, Baalam's donkey), spectacular miracles, and many theophanies (God walking in the garden, closing the door of Noah's ark). The material in Joshua, Judges, and Samuel has little or none of this; it is much more realistic in tone. Still, Friedman's theory is provocative and interesting, and his book should appeal to anyone with an interest in the historical context of the Hebrew Bible.	2002-02-01

Dr. Campbell avoids (and debunks) the sensationalist claims of some other writers in this field, while presenting the facts in a sober, no-nonsense tone. My only complaint is that his writing style is dry and somewhat droning. (Example: &quot;In the following section, the merits of two alternative theories regarding the function of the Qumran will be evaluated. The remainder of the chapter will then proceed to examine ...&quot;) A livelier style would have improved the book; even so, it's a quick, factual, and serious presentation that will interest anyone looking for information on the Qumran Scrolls and the community behind them.	2002-01-22

Some of the textual choices are debatable, and the translation often departs from literalness, sometimes omitting entire lines -- but the overall result is fresh and exciting; this nuanced rendition really brings the Song to life.<br />One thing to be aware of is that, other than the poem itself, a brief introduction, and some brief remarks by Robert Alter, the text consists mostly of very detailed translators' notes analyzing the verses line by line, even word by word. This material will be of interest to scholars of ancient Hebrew but perhaps not to the general reader. I read the book (sans notes) in about forty minutes -- and I have to wonder if I should have paid [amt] for the privelege. Nothing against the Blochs or their fine work, but I would have preferred more supporting material of more general interest.	2001-12-30

He then spends the rest of the book constructing his own historical biography of Jesus, using (of course) the four Gospels as his sources. Isn't there a contradiction here? Some of his insights and observations are provocative, while others struck me as just silly -- e.g., that the apostles mistook Jesus' lookalike brother for their resurrected teacher, or that the &quot;angels&quot; in the empty tomb were other family members of Jesus who had simply moved the corpse for reburial! (When they said Jesus was going to Galilee, Wilson says, they only meant that his body was being transported there. If so, this is the most consequential misunderstanding in history.) The book is a quick, provocative read, but I think you'd be better advised to check out the works of Bart Ehrman (a skeptic) or Luke Timothy Johnson (a believer). Either of them offers more serious scholarship than Wilson's book.	2001-11-25

Speaking only for myself, I like cryptic crosswords that are solved with the standard rules, as opposed to cryptics featuring specially invented rules (e.g., the answers are to be filled in backward, or with certain letters displaced or omitted, or with parts of words exchanged for parts of other words elsewhere in the grid). At least half the puzzles in this collection are oddball specimens of this type. If you're bored with regular cryptics and want a greater challenge, you'll love this book. If you prefer your cryptics &quot;straight,&quot; there are better choices.	2001-11-19

The author limits himself to the Judeo-Christian tradition, exploring obstacles to belief that may arise from the more problematic parts of the Bible -- particularly God's wrathful &quot;smiting&quot; of his enemies (and even, sometimes, his friends). The heart of the book is an extended discussion of the possibility of an evolving God who is neither all-knowing nor all-powerful. Much of this material parallels Jack Miles's GOD: A BIOGRAPHY (written, apparently, at around the same time), though Easterbook's treatment is more concise and focused, and covers the New Testament along with the Old. The development of God from vengeful warrior-king to peaceful redeemer is certainly a story of great interest, although one could (perhaps more plausibly) see it as a record of the moral improvement of human beings whose writings reflect God in their own image. (Edith Hamilton's excellent SPOKESMEN FOR GOD, out of print but worth finding, presents the issue from this perspective.) Easterbrook's thesis is provocative, and he states it in a clear, readable style, with wit and subtlety. A worthwhile book that leaves you feeling that you've just had an extended philosophical conversation with an intelligent and sympathetic friend.	2001-11-19

It's a squarish, thick book that can sort of fit in your pants pocket -- though it will stretch the pocket out a bit. The text is small, but dark and crisp. The gilt-edged paper is thin but not tissuey. There is a ribbon for marking your place. The leather cover is flexible and has a nice texture. (No &quot;snap&quot; closure on mine, though another reviewer mentioned one -- maybe two different editions?) Brief introductions to each book suggest the time and place of authorship, the theme and message, and offer some pious speculation about the authors themselves. (Those of us who are skeptical that Moses wrote the Pentateuch may not find much help here.) Color maps at the back are titled The World of the Patriarchs, Exodus, Land of the Twelve Tribes, Kingdom of David, Jesus' Ministry, Paul's Journeys, and Jerusalem in Jesus' Time. <br />The book has two columns of text divided by a narrow column of text notes and cross references. Here are Genesis 22 and 23: &quot;The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, /'This is now bone of my bones,/ And flesh of my flesh;/ She shall be called Woman,/ Because she was taken out of Man.'&quot; Text notes indicate that &quot;fashioned&quot; is literally &quot;built,&quot; that &quot;She&quot; (twice in Verse 23) is literally &quot;This one,&quot; that &quot;Woman&quot; is &quot;Ishshah&quot; in Hebrew, and that &quot;Man&quot; is &quot;Ish&quot; (thus explaining the play on words). Cross references direct you to 1 Cor 11:8,9; Gen 29:14; and Eph 5:28,29. As you can see, the translation is clear and readable without being dumbed down, and where liberties are taken, the literal meaning is supplied in the notes. All this, and it fits in the palm of your hand. As Marge would say, I just think it's neat.	2001-11-08

The text is extremely tiny, but crisp and dark; I find it fairly easy to read, though not everyone will agree. No concordance, no study guides, only the standard NIV footnotes, but what do you expect from a pocket-size edition? I bought the &quot;leather bound&quot; edition -- actually a rather stiff, slightly cheap-feeling imitation leather, though it softens up with use. Overall, a good buy, but the leather version may not be worth the extra money.	2001-11-03

An earlier reviewer claimed that certain verses, such as Matthew 18:11 and Acts 8:37, were left out, but in fact they are given as footnotes (apparently because there is some dispute as to their authenticity). My biggest qualm about this edition concerns the introductory notes to some of the books. In what may be an excess of piety, the editors go so far as to assert that King Solomon probably wrote the Song of Solomon and most of Proverbs, that Paul wrote all of the Pauline epistles, and (most dubious of all) that Moses probably wrote the Pentateuch! Few serious scholars would accept these claims. The editors also avoid discussion of how different Biblical traditions were conflated -- e.g., the two versions of the Flood story, which appear to have been interleaved, verse by verse, by a late redactor. Still, this edition is well worth owning for the grace and readability of the NIV translation, as well as the wealth of footnotes and other supporting material. As a bonus, the type is big enough to be read without eyestrain (at least as far as my middle-aged eyes are concerned).	2001-10-15

There are too many characters, and most of them are insufficiently developed. The book also suffers from patches of cliche writing (one character's &quot;heart literally (?) leaped into his throat,&quot; a rich neighborhood &quot;smelled of old money,&quot; a person has vanished &quot;like the wind,&quot; etc.), technical errors in the description of police procedure, and lapses of continuity. (At one point we are told that a character &quot;couldn't make it&quot; to dinner, but two pages later it seems that he did make it, after all.) I know these sound like little things, and they are, but after a while they start to add up. On the positive side, the author has ambitiously woven together a variety of story elements -- near-death experiences, ESP, Alzheimer's, crime, bereavement -- in an intriguing way. The idea is good, but in my opinion the execution falls short. It still makes for a diverting read, though.	2001-03-31

Berryman's insightful essay on &quot;Shakespeare at Thirty&quot; is alone worth the cover price. The real heart of the book is the author's lectures on Shakespeare's body of work, from the earliest comedies to &quot;Shakespeare's Last Word&quot; (&quot;The Tempest&quot;). While I disagree with some of Berryman's idiosyncratic readings, such as his endorsement of an Oedipal complex for Hamlet and his disparagement of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; I nevertheless found the book consistently interesting, always readable, and sometimes brilliant. I would rank it among the best general-interest books on Shakespeare in the last fifty years or so. Also recommended: Harold Goddard's two-volume THE MEANING OF SHAKESPEARE.	2001-03-12

I found it too far out to be taken seriously. Since then, I've read a great deal on the evidence for paranormal phenomena, and my thinking on the subject has changed a lot. Rereading \\"The Holographic Universe\\" recently, I found that many of my earlier objections had melted away. Talbot still relies on some dubious examples - as another reader points out, the Indian mystic Sai Baba has been thoroughly discredited, yet Talbot takes him quite seriously. Talbot also shares some of his personal experiences, which can be pretty hard to swallow. Nevertheless, much of what he discusses is based on solid research in areas like out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, and so forth. Talbot's integration of this material with the Pribam model of a holographic mind and the Bohm model of an implicate order is fresh, original, and provocative. His book is consistently well written, and he summarizes a great deal of information in a clear, concise way, while making some complex scientific concepts easily understandable. Don't be too put off by the scoffing skeptics. There's some neat stuff in here.	2001-02-10

The book is written in an extremely disjointed, almost incoherent style -- choppy incomplete sentences, longstringsoftextwithnospacesbetweenthewords, weird HTML language that means nothing to me, fanciful dialogues between Drudge and his cat, copyright and trademark symbols printed everywhere for no apparent reason, and long, irrelevant, boring descriptions of parties Drudge has attended and the celebrities who either a) smiled at him tolerantly or b) glared at him malevolently.

Again and again he professes to be bowled over by the brilliant insights of the experts he's  interviewing, though their insights often seemed pretty shallow and dubious  to me. For instance, he asks the question of whether the Resurrection story  could be a hoax, only to be told that significant historical movements  &quot;never&quot; originate in hoaxes. Yet at another point in the book, he  clearly insinuates that The Book of Mormon was a hoax (because its  historical claims have not been verified by archaeology). Well, if so, then  how does Strobel account for the considerable success of the Mormon Church  -- certainly a significant historical movement? Can a hoax generate a large  religious movement, or not? He can't have it both ways -- but he does, over  and over again. Obvious follow-up questions are not asked; alternative  points of view are not sought; &quot;friendly&quot; witnesses are tracked  down even over a distance of thousands of miles, while potentially  &quot;hostile&quot; witnesses are not interviewed at all. On the plus side,  the book is readable, and some of the interviews are at least  thought-provoking. For a more sophisticated, but equally pious, defense of  the New Testament, look at Donald Spoto's &quot;The Hidden Jesus: A New  Life.&quot; For a rationalist alternative to Strobel's book, read  &quot;Asimov's Guide to the Bible (the New Testament).&quot;	2000-06-20

As a former Objectivist, I recognized the truth of Walker's words over and over again throughout this  well-researched, but sometimes indifferently organized, book. 'The Ayn Rand  Cult' can serve as an 'intervention' or 'deprogramming' for those who have  allowed their own personalities to be absorbed by the dominating personae  of Rand's fictional heroes ... and of Rand herself. What's sad is that the  people most in need of this book will probably never read it!<br />Also  recommended: 'Without a Prayer: Ayn Rand and the Close of Her System,' by  John W.

There are some effective scenes, but the parts are greater than the  whole. The author's frequent, often sarcastic allusions to THE SILENCE OF  THE LAMBS only succeeded in reminding me of all the reasons why LAMBS is a  much better book.	2000-05-09

One thing to be aware  of is that Amazon has erred in listing the book as only 70 pages long;  actually, it's more than 400 pages!

In one stroke Harris has torpedoed his reputation, trashed his most famous  fictional creations, and insulted and alienated his loyal readers. It's  almost pointless to analyze the book's innumerable crippling flaws -- the  Grand Guignol absurdity, the flights of literary and intellectual  pretentiousness, the total absence of believability, logic, suspense, or  even basic professionalism. The worst hack writer banging out a book a  month for his rent money would be embarrassed to put his name on this  monumental dreck.

But over time I've changed my mind. Having read a lot more about both topics, I now think that his summary of the anthropic principle, though perhaps a little too concise, is excellent, and that near-death experiences do provide sigificant evidence of a spiritual dimension to life. So I've replaced my previous two-star review with a five-star rating. Glynn got me thinking about topics that I never expected to take seriously, and his concern for the moral implications of theistic and nonetheistic belief is admirable. Read this book.	1999-06-11
