And now I read his book.  Both are really good ways to improve the abdominal region.  After reviewing both, the book is much better.  Although the video has a much more to offer in  the routine, the book offers dietary information and a better way to an  abdominal workout.<br />The book sticks to the three minute theory.  And after  doing enough sets, three minutes is enough.  His exercises take into  consideration people with lower back pain, and I truely appreciated  that.<br />Even if you never get the six pack, this book will definetly lead  you into the right direction.  No gimmick in the world can provide the  intensity and portability that this routine provides.	2000-07-24

The set-up is good, American style on the left, German on the right.  But for an American trying to understand German business practice, it will not give the 20/20 that a professional needs.<br />It leaves out things such as business hours.  Which can be rather fustrating for Americans that are used to 24/7.  They cherish their Sundays, and have very short business hours the rest of the week.  <br />I was able to read this book during my train ride from Nurnberg to Bamberg, on a RE train that only covered 56K.  Which means it is a relatively short book.<br />The German culture is much more sophisticated then the image written in the book.  A businees professional that reads this book will trip over thier feet if they follow the guidelines.<br />Yes they are organized, and yes they like punctuallity.  But they are extremely friendly, and most American customs are welcomed.  <br />If you are about to enter into a German business agreement, learn the language.  Just trying to speak their language will go a long way.  My last bit of advice is don't be put off if they smoke in their office.	2000-07-14

The author could not have written a more boring book.<br />The action is slow if existant at all, and written in a way that you would  think if it was narrated you would think a sermon was being given.<br />I  picked this book up with the greatest intentions.

And at times, the author just throughs out some abstract, needless information.  Almost as if he just to put it in their, because he thought the trival knowledge would  make the book better.<br />Well it doesn't.  It does fine all by itself.  It  gives some great insightful information to the reason behind some of U.S  invasions, wars, and other candelstine efforts foreign and domestic.   <br />Anybody that lived through the era that the book was covered will get  bored easily as no true secrets are revealed.  But for those born around  the 80's, will become very informed.<br />A good book, but not that good.  I  give it three stars because the title does not match the book.	2000-06-15
