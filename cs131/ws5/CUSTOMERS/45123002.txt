If you are a fan of the 1976 bicentennial series by Jakes you will think he has become mentally feeble and lost all writing ability.  If you are a history buff you will abhor this book.  If you are a first time reader of the Civil War and think darkies sang zippidy doo dah through their slavery you will LOVE this book.  I believe Mr. Jakes has lost his perspective on history and is just tired of writing but writes because he has a \\"name\\".  Sometimes it is just best to stop until you have an epiphany or just stop because the well is dry.  I would advise Civil War readers to pass this one by.  I am donating my copy to the library.	2005-09-21

I had just finished her most excellent books on the Beatrix Potter murders and jumped into this book.  It's like switching from one pallet to another without a swish of water.  My mind was expecting the same experience as the Potter books and it got another kind of reading experience - took a few pages to get into this book.  It's a series of mysteries surrounding facts about herbs and plants - which I dearly love.  It took a few chapters and then the book became interesting, although the receipes and herb facts are wonderful.  I will read the rest of the series - and SO SHOULD EVERY OTHER READER.  Good Book!	2005-08-23

I am an avid art follower of Beatrix Potter - and Ms. Albert has capitalized on her original life story and added delightful little animal characters that speak (which I believe they actually do in life) and made a wonderful story and town in which to mentally dwell.  If you are interested in the writing of Jan Karon, Mignon Ballard, Lori Copeland and Nancy Atherton then you will HAVE to have both of these books and then will wait with bated breath for the next in the series.

He has combined history, biblical fact and imagination in such a way that you hate to finish the book knowing that another will be a long time in coming.  I have now read all of his books and shelved them behind glass along with Douglas & Childs and Diana Gabaldon as treasures to pass along in my will.
