I think that she's going to be around for a while. I found this book to be an easy read. I finished it in one day. I was hoping for a bit more humor which the title and the back cover hint at but I wasn't too dissapointed.<br /><br />The Story has Sarah Hamilton, and American, coming to England to live with her Uncle, the Earl. When she gets here she's mistaken for a lady of the night and ends up in the hero's bed. She is exhausted and has no idea that there has been such a mistake. She falls asleep and never knows the owner of the bed has returned. The Duke, James, is certainly suprised by the red haired beauty naked in his bed. He wants to wake her but is unable to and decides to wait until morning. Well morning arrives and both are found naked by the Dukes relatives and friends. Of course Sara must marry James to save her reputation. The only problem, she isn't sure that's what she wants to do. She ends up living in his home as a companion to his sister and going to London. All the while James is very willing to convince her to be his bride. Oh and there is a very unique plot twist too.<br /><br />There is also an evil that is threatening to destroy both of them and together they must defeat it.<br /><br />I enjoyed this tale. It was a good book and I look forward to others by this author.	2005-02-14

Her books are always filled with tons of humor that leave me laughing so hard my belly hurts and I have tears running down my face. Her characters are so real that you could swear you know them personally.<br /><br />Hard Day's Knight takes place at a Renaissance Faire. The Heroine, Pepper, has never been to one of these so she's experiencing a bit of culture shock. Especially when she has to put on the Official Wenches Guild costume. Her breasts will never be the same.<br /><br />The hero,Walker, is a sexy Englishman who's voice melts Peppers heart. He also looks really tasty in tights! He is also a man who has scars from his past that haunt him and prevent him from winning not only the Jousting tournament but Pepper.<br /><br />Pepper has to overcome her fear of horses, and learn to joust to help Walker see the man he truley is and the man she loves.<br /><br />The supporting characters in this story bind it together making it a well written and complete story.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more from this author. She is definately one of my favorites.	2005-02-14

Well this is the first book of what I call the Marine books. the other two are \\"Shadow of the Hawk\\" and \\"Always Faithful\\". All three books are wonderful. The heros are tough and strong and yet can be tender and vulnerable.<br />In this book the hero, Brodie, is a immortal. He has been cursed to live forever by an evil sorcerer, who's daughter he accidnetly killed. He will carry the scars of his many battles on the outside forever, but its the scars on his heart that the heroine, BJ, wants to heal. BJ is a computer wiz who has a problem. Someone is sabotaging her company and using her programs to do it. Brodie comes to her aid to help find the real culprit.<br />This book had me crying and laughing. I hated for it to end. i was thrilled when I found it had sequels. I would definately recommend this book and the other two.	2004-02-16

I didn't like the way they even interacted with each other. I normally like it when the hero and heroine don't get along right off and then realize that they really love each other but these two just annoyed me. I wish I could rate this higher but I just can't. Hopefully her next book will be better.	2004-02-16
US	40938563	R2A5237WPXRA1I	0743411986	951377831	Obsession	Books	3	4	7	N	N	a good book but not much romance at all.	Well if you are looking for romance it is not this book. This is a tale more of redemption. The other two books in the series Miracle and Devotion are the romances. This book is the continuation of Devotion and the Story of Maria and Trey.<br />I enjoyed the book and was on the edge of my seat wondering how it would all turn out. I was a bit shocked by the violence in the book and the sad states of the characters both main and secondary. The author paints a bleak picture of how life can go terribly wrong but also gives us insite on how we all can change our own destinys.<br />I would recommend this book only as a follow up to the other two, its not a stand alone book.	2004-01-07

OK now I hardly ever give a book a 5 star rating so this was a first in quite a while. I have to be really emotionaly touched by a story to give it a 5, this story did that. I always knew that Zarek's Story was going to be good. He is such a lost, tortured soul that it would be powerful, I just didn't realize how powerful.<br />Sherrilyn writes of a man who has never known any form of love or compassion. He assumes that he is worthless and that everyone should treat him that way. He has been alone for so long that even though he craves companionship, he has no idea how to talk to someone. You could actually feel how lonely he was and see the pain in his eyes.<br />Astrid is a Nymph (not Nympho, yet) who has come to judge him. She must decide if he is to live or be put to death. She is blind while on Earth and must use her heart to find the truth. When she meets Zarek, she knows that this man is not like any she's met or judged before. There is a real possibility that he is innocent.<br />An evil Dark-hunter killer is sent to dispatch Zarek. He want his revenge and is now after Astrid as well. Zarek must fight the fight of his life to save the one person in the whole universe that means more to him than anything ever has. He is willing to die to save her.<br />I laughed and cried reading this book, mostly cried. I know I just finished this book but I already want to reread it. The love scenes are hot but also so very tender that it makes your heart ache. There is humor in this book mostly provided by Simi and Sasha. There is danger and excitement. There is love.<br />I really can't recommend this book enough. It was simply a wonderful treasure.	2003-12-15
US	40938563	R5F4V7SXZ4ONL	1553164903	31164140	1: The Shadow Dweller Series, Volume I: One With The Hunger, Retribution	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An Amazing book! 1st of a series!	This book was wonderful. Its actually two books in one. The first one is \\"One With the Hunger\\" Its a vampire book,one of my favorite. This is also the first book in a series. The hero is Val, a mysterious, dark, gorgeous, hunk of Vampire who has found his mate. Shai Jordan is a quiet, hardworking woman. She has a wonderful group of very excentric friends who only want her happiness. They decide she needs a man. And guess who is very willing to fulfill those needs. You guessed it, Val. There is more than just hot sexual attraction between these two. Both are tracking a killer, someone who is ruthless and pure evil. I really enjoyed this story and my only complaint would be it was too short!<br />The second story is \\"Retribution\\". This is the story of Shai's and Val's friends Jennifer and Conor \\"Mac\\" MacNaughton. In this story we find out how Val and Jennifer know each other. Also We find that Jennifer and Mac have a past. Its a past that has tarnished their lives and it will take a lot of trust and compassion on both sides to overcome the hurt. Oh and by the way while this is all going on they all must fight against the evil killer who escaped in the first book. We meet several new characters in this book who go on to have their own stories.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good hot vampire book. I do have one question though, do all vampires come from the Carpathian mountains? I know that is where the vampires in Christine Feehan's books are from and so I was suprised to read that Val is from there as well. Must be something in the water.	2003-11-26

I am a sucker for books where either one of the main characters is blind or deaf or injured. It evens out all the books that have perfect heros and heroines. True beauty is in the heart and soul of a person and its refreshing when an author has the insight to write about it.<br />The hero, Captain Rutger Grayson, is no longer a &quot;looker&quot;. Terrrilby scarred he is shunned by polite society. but not all of his scars are visible. He is haunted by his past and has accepted that he unlovable but when a beautiful and seemingly perfect young woman approaches him to help her find his brother, he finds himself hoping that she can see what lies beneath the scars. The irony is that she can't see at all, blinded by illness, Lady Calire Aylesbury lives in a world of darkness, and yet she only sees light when she's with Rutger.<br />Together they work to find her brother. While doing so they manage to brighten each other's lives in ways neither thought possible.<br />I really enjoyed this book. I would love to read more from this author.	2003-11-08

I love how all her heroines are plus sized beauties and have great hunks who love them that way.I also love that her heroines have class and style. They are strong women who can handle any situation put before them.<br />In His Brother's Child, the heroine,Faith, is pregnant. The result of a one night stand at a party. She is also the victim of a cruel joke. The babies father wants nothing to do with either of them so its up to his brother,Edward to pick up the pieces. The kicker is that to Edward, Faith is a dream come true. He knows he loves her from the get go but because of her distrust of men, thanks to his brother, she is afraid to open up her heart again.<br />Its not only a love story but a story about hope. How it only takes one person who,with loving patience, can give a person the strength to overcome fears and to embrace life.<br />I hope to read many more of Pat's books. Each one is a treat.	2003-11-08

Well first off I have to say that if you want to read a book that is full of humor, hot, sticky, passionate love scenes, great heros and fantastic heroines, story lines that keep you reading long after you should be asleep, then read a book by Katie MacAlister. I have read everything she's published so far and I eagerly await more.<br />One thing I really like about the way Katie writes is that she writes as if this were her story. You don't find many authors writting in the 1st person so its refreshing to read Katie's books.<br />A Girl's Guide To Vampires is a thrill ride. You have a lot of suspense and danger that keeps you guessing until the end. You have two wonderfully funny friends, Joy, the Heroine and Roxy the adorable best friend. The hero Raphael is.... Well let's just say I want one exactly like him! Raphael's rival Christian ain't too shabby himself.<br />I even loved the cover of this book. Its way to cute!<br />All in all I have to say that this is a WINNER!!!!<br />Run, don't walk to buy this book.	2003-11-08

Katie did a wonderful job of bringing to life my greatest fantasy, of meeting a Scotsman and falling in love and living in Scotland. Actually I have to change that a bit, its more like \\"of meeting a Kilted Scotsman, who is a big hunk and has a brogue that can bring a woman to her knees. The rest is pretty much the same. I wonder if Katie was reading my mine when she thought of this, hummmmmmm.<br />Well On to the book. Its packed with incredible humor. It had me laughing so hard I was freaking out my cats. The love scenes were so hot and so well written the pages almost ignited. The characters of Iain and Kathie so compelling that you were rooting for them the whole way. I loved the fact that they weren't extremely young and innocent. I like to see heroines closer to my own age. Plus it proves that sex ain't just for the young! The supporting characters were real and truely added to the book.<br />This is going to go on my keeper shelf. I know that I will read and reread this book until it falls apart and I have to buy it again. I highly recommend it to everyone.	2003-11-08

Now I will admit I like her Bridgerton series a bit more, I still found this book to able to amuse me and make me forget about my day to day life,<br />Now in this book the heroine, Emma, is an American heiress who has come to London to enjoy a Season but she's not looking for a husband.

The heorine, Marie has come to Europe trying to bascially find herself. She encounters Fredrik, the most dangergous,facinating man she's every met. His past is dark and there are horrid rumors about him. She is warned to stay away from him but soon finds that she can't. He wants her and is determined to make her his so he basically traps her.When I first read this story I only gave it a 2. I didn't really like the fact that he was so demanding of her. I reread it and have changed my mind. I can now see the pain that Fredirk was in and how desperately he wanted someone to love him as much as he loved her.<br />The love scenes are pretty graphic but not in the disgusting way. They show true passion. Although if you are embarassed but such graphic scenes this book may not be for you.	2003-07-05

Ok first off I have to say that this book is not for the reader who has problems reading sex scenes that are very graphic.<br />Now that that has been said on to the review. Well this is a story of very strong women. In fact those women rule the planet and men are pets. They are wild and captured and sold as pets to pleasure the women. Most don't speak until they are trained to. They serve thier mistresses without question. Now this is the only life the heroine Arness has ever known. In fact she tracks and captures men and then sells them for profit. That is until she meets a captive named Adan. Adan can speak and is fighting to be free. He is a handleful and Arness thinks she is the one to tame him, but soon its a toss up as to who has tamed who. They soon find that they are strongly attracted to each otherand together they must over come thier fears as well as societies rules to be happy.<br />I enjoyed this book and not just for the great love scenes.

The sex is very graphic and there is a lot of it.<br />I enjoyed this book because it was different. It is a sci-fi-romance-erotic-adventure. The main characters are humans who have been kidnapped and taken aboard this ship for study by the Revan. Its a study of sex. The Revan no longer have sex but have found that the lack of it is killing them. They have gathered subjects from several worlds to watch them have sex. They create several  different sexual situations for the subjects. The subjects are not allowed to resist because they are mind controlled. Once the Revan have all the info they need they will disspose of the subjects.<br />The two humans, Bruce and Jenna, are rival althletes. They have a strong attraction to each other but have never really acted upon it until now. Now that they are thrown into this bizare situation they must drawn on thier feelings of both attraction and respect for each other to fight for thier lives. Along the way they fall in love. Now the love story is sort of a minor detail in this tale. Its more about the sex.<br />I liked the concept of this story and my only complaint was that I wanted the love story to be more of the story and that would have made the sex more interesting.	2003-03-25

I have enjoyed several of Margaret Moore's other books and was expecting this one to be as enjoyable as those. The best i can give it is an ok rating.<br />The story is of a lonely penniless knight trying to make his way in a world were you are ruled by your actions. He has fallen out of favor with the king and now is working to rebuild his life. The heroine is the beautiful, dutyful daughter of a man who has no will to live. She has had to take over the running of the castle at a very young age as well as bringing up her younger siblings. She is being courted by an evil man who turns her stomach. When the hero and heroine meet by accident they soon realize thier feelings for each other but know that they cannot act upon them.<br />I liked the secondary characters more that the major players. I would like to see books with the brother and sister as the leads. I liked the book but just didn't get into it like I thought I would.	2003-03-25

I couldn't see real people in them at all.<br />It took me a while, several days to get through this book. I kept putting it down and read several books in between.

It was good but nothing special.<br />The story takes place in 999 just before the turn of the millennium. In other words Y1k. There are all the doomsday believers who think that the world will end with the coming year. There are also those who believe that the new century is a time for new beginnings. Rafael Leonhart is one of those people. He is apart of a leggend that states that the land of Alderich will change hands and no longer belong to the Rune. So to help insure that this does happen Rafael takes Serath Rune hostage. She is the granddaughter of the Ruling Rune. The only problem is that Serath's grandfather has no love for her at all. This puts a crimp in Rafael's plans but what effects those plans even more is his growing attraction and feelings for his hostage. She is feared by many but he knows that she is not what she appears to be.<br />It was a good book not a great one but a good one.	2003-03-16

The fact that our heroine has had 8 lives and that the last just ended. The cause, a bowling ball. Now I don't normally think of a bowling ball as a deadly weapon but after I read this book I certainly kept my eye on the next person to bowl. Anyway this story is a combo Time-Travel/Reincartion romance. Tracy, the heroine has lived 8 lives and been killed horribly in every one of them. She is now given a 9th chance but she's now been thrown back in time to 1875. Now Tracy has had it. She is very aware of her past lives and how they ended. She is ticked and demands that in her next life she have health,wealth and absolutely no chance for love. Love being the cause of all of her past death's. The \\"Resettlement Committee\\" in heaven agrees and they place her in the body of a woman in 1875 Montana. Now she has to deal with the fact that she a modern woman is now not allowed to many things just because she is a woman and also deal with the very attractive Seth Murdoch.<br />Seth has only known Tracy as the sickly woman named Nora. Suddenly she goes from her death bed to wonderous health. Aslo she has become a very strong, independant, beautiful woman who knocks him off his feet. He finds hims self confused by her ways but also very drawn to her.<br />Tracy/Nora, who wanted no chance at love now finds herself dreaming of Seth and wants his love. Together they must overcome obsticals in order to be together.<br />I enjoyed this story and probably will buy more from this author. Its filled with humor and sweetness. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a story that will make them smile and laugh and feel great after.	2003-03-02

It is very erotic. The Love scenes, and there are several, are very,very descriptive. This book is an E-book and the only complaint I have was that I had to set at my computer and read it rather than in my nice comfy Laz-y-Boy recliner. Oh well you can't have everything.<br />This book is about a plus size woman. I loved that. She goes on a singles cruise with a friend. She soon realizes that she's not what everyone seems to be looking for. She wants to go hide in her room but its occupied by her friend so she ends up on deck.

It didn't thrill me like the 1st, the 3rd, and the 5th did. I found those books to be filled with more passion and I really liked the interaction between the main characters more. This one has a lot of mystery in it which did make for some excitement.<br />Well it's Alasdair's turn. He's known to most as Lucifer and he's the last of the original Bar Cynster. He decides to leave London and the matchmakers to visit an old friend. When he arrives in Devon he finds his old friend dead and wakes with a aching head.

She is a strong, smart,savy business woman who like Lucifer wants to find the killer.<br />Phyllida, has many suitors who have tried to get her to the alter but none have the stunning effect that Lucifer does. He makes resisting him the hardest thing she's ever done.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters were a little lacking in depth but the love scenes are very erotic and graphic. If you are not a person who likes to read very erotic love scenes then I wouldn't get this book.<br />Its a story of how two people are brought together by the heroine's mad husband, to mate so that he may have an heir. The Hero, Fawkes, was sent to couple with the heroine, Lady Nicola. He never realized how that one night would effect him for the rest of his life. Now 3 1/2 years later he has returned a victorious knight to claim Mordeaux Castle and the Lady Nicola.<br />Nicola's life was also profoundly effected by that one night. It was the only night of pleasure that she's ever had. Her husband was a cruel man, and now that he is gone she is both thankful and fearful. She doesn't recognize the knight Fawkes as the tender lover of years past. She is afraid of him and keeps many secrets. But even though she fears him she is strongly drawn to him as he is to her. The passion they share is explosive and they are unable to fight it. Soon passion leads to love but when the secrets are reveiled all could be ruined.<br />I look forward to more from this author.	2003-02-08

Her daughter and her wacky neighbor conjured him up and now she has to deal with him. Now if he looked like the cover mode I could think of several ways to &quot;deal&quot; with him but its not my story so I won't go into those.<br />I liked Simon. He was a marvel. He took his djinni duties seriously but longed for the freedom that had been denied him. I didn't care much for Zoe, the heroine, though. She seemed too interested in her business than in her daughter and of course in Simon. I mean it was good that she wanted her business to succeed but at what cost. I just felt that her character could have lightened up a bit. She did come to her senses a bit toward the end.<br />I did enjoy the secondary characters. They added to the total mayhem and brought lots of humor to the book. I would love to read a book about Darius.<br />I would recommend this book for a lite afternoon read.	2003-02-02

I read everything she puts out, usually over and over again. That's what I did with this book. I orginally read it years ago and recently found it again and was just a thrilled this time. Connie has a way of making even the most fierce heros vulunerable and the weakest heroines strong and courageous. Her characters always compliment each other so well that if they were real we know they'd be together always.<br />\\"The Lion's Bride\\" starts off right after William the Conquerer has taken England. One of his knights,Lyon, who saved his life, has now been charged with the Protection of Cragmere, the home of Ariana. Ariana is determined not to let William's Lion rule her. But Lyon is under orders to Marry the wench and take control. He does but then sends her to a convent for 5 years until he needs his wife. Ariana goes thru with the marriage and retreats to the convent but conspires with her former betrothed, Edric.<br />Now 5 years later Ariana has grown into a beautiful woman and Lyon has need of his wife. Lyon is to return to Cragmere and help prevent a rebellion. So he sends for his wife, hoping to find her docile. Well that's not to be. Ariana is a strong willful woman who speaks her mind. Lyon is struck with her beauty but cannot trust her not to betray him or his heart.<br />Ariana is also amazed when she returns to find that the man who she has hated for years is stirring feelings in her that confuse her. Together they must follow their passions to wherever they lead or else they will burn out.<br />The book is filled with Connie's famous erotic love scenes that could make the book erupt in flames. You can always count on her books to do that.<br />I found this book to be very enjoyable and as always i look forward to others by Connie.	2003-02-02

I hope to meet her in person some day. Until then I will have to read all of her books again and again.<br />Now this book is tied in with her book Paradise City. Both are sci-fi romances that pack a lot of action and heat. The hero of this book, Nemesis, is a dark, fearsome warrior who has a fierce reputation as a mercenary. He also has a secret. He has admired and dreamed about the heroine for years. Princess Kiara is a wonderful dancer who soon finds herself in very close quarters with Nemesis. He is protecting her from her father's enemies but at a high cost, his heart. The two are trying to fight their growing attraction for each other but failing.

It just seemed a bit lacking so it took me several days to read. I wish it had been better.	2002-10-26

I have enjoyed all of Robin's books but I think this one was the best so far. This is the sequel to THE LOVER which was Gabriel's friend Michael's story. Now while that one was exciting and thrilling this one surpasses it by a mile. I stayed up all night reading this because I couldn't put it down.<br />Gabriel is a tormented man. He is a former high priced [prostitute] but not for women but for men. He hated it. He only did it to get wealthy enough to find the men who had raped him so long ago. He has found one but the other is still at large. He now owns a famous house of sex. Where the rich come to act out thier every fantasy. On the reopening night a innocent 34 year old terroized woman, Victoria, shows up to sell the only she has left of value, her virginity, to the highest bidder. Victoria was a governess who was dismissed by a jealous woman and now after six months without work is desperate. She captures Gabriel's attention and knows that she is the key to his revenge. She is also the key to his salvation.  Soon they find that they cannot ignore thier passions. The love scenes in this are so well written  that the reader will blush with both embarassment and longing for more.<br />The story takes exciting turns that keep the reader on thier toes. ... is just around the corner and when its revealed its a suprise.<br />I really think that Robin has outdone herself on this book. She tackles taboo subjects with ease and makes the characters truely human faults and all. I would recommend reading THE LOVER first to get the full story.	2002-09-22

She somehow survives and now provides a haven for the virgins that have followed her to their \\"deaths\\".

I really had a hard time with this book. it was boring, jumbled, dull and I had to struggle to finish it. I have never wanted to throw a book away more. I thought it would be a wonderful futuristic romance but it never lived up to the cover. I found the characters very underdeveloped and the story didn't have a strong plot line. I felt like I had come into the story when it was almost over. I'm sorry but I cound't recommend this book at all.	2002-09-01

I found the writing to be jumbled in areas. It seemed to jump around and it was a bit hard to follow. I got bored very easily. I found it to be very funny in spots and I would have loved to have read more scenes with the two raccoons. I just didn't feel the characters were developed enough to hold my interest.

The plot line is dark and mysterious and kept me guessing. I found the characters to be fairly well developed but I would have liked to have the &quot;Shadowing&quot; explained in a bit more detail. It was a bit weak in that respect. The love scenes were wonderfully written. I enjoyed the struggle that both main characters had to go through to finally find happiness.<br />I would like to read more from this author in this same style. Great cover art as well. It's what first drew me to the book.	2002-09-01

The Normans have come and taken over but there are still those who oppose them, fighting. Lily is trapped between the two sides. She is a widow who is running for her very life.

But the rath of Radulf is not all she must face, there is a enemy who wishes to harm her and her love. Together Radul and Lily must fight to keep the peace, bring together a nation, and the love they share strong.<br />This story is definately a keeper and I will re-read this one again.	2002-08-26

I didn't care for the first book I read by this author but was pleasantly suprised by this one. I liked the plot line and the charactrs were well written. The discriptions of everyday life made it feel as though you were watching it happen.<br />This is a time-travel-historical. The heroine, Ana conjures a warrior to help save her mother. She is hoping for the legendary Irish warrior, Cuchuliann, but what she gets is a modern day man who plays footbal for a team called the Warriors.

She feels just as strongly for him but knowing that he must go back to his time she is afraid to let her heart feel for him.<br />There is action, humor, passion and love in this story. It is filled with many secondary characters that help tie it all together. I really enjoyed it and I hope her other books are as good.	2002-08-18

Its not a direct sequel but two of the supporting characters from the first book \\"The Cat's Fancy\\" Deena and Hoop are just as wonderful in this book.<br />The heorine is a Superheroine, or at least a would be Superheroine.

Jocelyn soon realizes that she cannot change the fact that she is now someone else and in another time but decides to adapt. She starts with making the new body hers which causes several raised eyebrows. She soon enlists Garren's father to help her win Garren. It is a very amusing plan.<br />Garren soon realizes that he needs her and loves her but is still unable to believe her story. They both must struggle to trust each other and overcome the past and the future.<br />I really enjoyed this tale and I look forward to others by this author. I'd like to see a sequel about the girl who took over Jocelyn's modern body.	2002-08-18

It was a good story and had a good plot but I had to push myself to get back into the story.

She has created some of the most memorible characters. Her books are never boring. They always have action, passion, heated arguments, and humor. I would recommend any and all of her books to everyone.<br />This one starts off when we meet, Prince\\"Charming\\" Perico Tomas de la Ferrama, aka P.T. as he is getting into character for his Princely role of owner of Ferrama Shoes.

I liked most of the story, the plot was interesting which inticed me to buy the book in the first place but it seemed to ramble on and then would jump around that it was a bit confusing to read. I thought that the heroine was well done but the hero Luke was unrealized. The book took me days to get through because it tended to drag.

I couldn't put it down. i have enjoyed all the Bridgerton books and was so excited to see Colin get his story. I also like that the heroine in this story was not the typical heroine. Penelope is not the &quot;young&quot; debutant that most tend to be. She is considered a spinster at the ripe old age of 28! Of course at that time she was off the market.<br />She has been a family friend for years and Colin, even though he has always liked her, he never really looked at her or considered her more that another sister. Well that all changes when he comes back to London. Penelope has loved Colin since the first time she saw him. She has cherished every moment they have spent together and has accepted her fate as a spinster and thinks that those brief memories will be all she will have. How wrong she is.<br />Now that Colin is having Penelope haunt his dreams he can't stay away from her and will do anything to protect her from any harm. Even keep her secrets. Together they shock society and even their own families when they reveal thier love for each other.<br />Also the infamous Lady Whistledown plays a big part in the story like she has done in all the other books.<br />I'd read these books in the order they came out to avoid confusion even though all the books are so well written they can stand alone.

I have enjoyed all of them and I get excited when a new one comes along. If you haven't read them start!<br />This book is the 7th full lenght novel in the series. Ther is also a novella in the book &quot;After Twilight&quot; that has a tie in with the series.<br />This is Gabriel's story. He is the twin to Lucian. They are very ancient Carpathians that have lived for over 2000 years. Gabriel has been in the ground for years in Paris and whe he rises its to find that Paris has changed and that his twin, Lucian who has turned vampire has also risen. Gabriel soonn is found by Francesca who is also Carpathian and his lifemate.

Ok I have loved every book in the Dark series but I really think that this one may have been the best. I couldn't put it down. I usually like to spread these books out so that I don't have to wait and wait for the next but after I read Dark Legend which is Gabriel's story and found out that this was Lucian's story I had to read it as soon as I got it.<br />Lucian is the twin to Gabriel and is one of the very ancient ones. He has lived for over 2000 years as the greatest hunter of the Carpathians. He has a voice that can make even the most evil of vampires do whatever he wants. He soon finds though that his voice, although compelling, cannot easily command his lifemate. After centuries he finds her. She is human but has special abilities that allow her to be his true lifemate. Jaxx has had a horrid childhood and is a loner because of it. She is haunted by a evil past that has stalked her and everyone deer to her for years. Lucian has vowed to protect her but she is a cop and can protect herself. She fears that she will put Lucian in danger so she fights what her heart and soul are telling her. She decides that she will protect Lucian and fight alongside him in his battles. This is the first time the heroine has taken such a strong role in protecting her lifemate. I really enjoyed how she could be both strong yet vulnerable at the same time.<br />The love scenes are hot and so wonderfully written. The whole book is just so good that I was both happy and sad at the end because I knew I'd have to wait awhile for a new book. I would recommend these books to anyone, not just because they are romances but because the stories are so well written that you feel like the characters are actually real.	2002-07-13
US	40938563	R278OT769LB6AA	0505524503	376574179	After Twilight	Books	3	4	4	N	N	3 great stories	Well I normally don't like short story collections because they are short stories. Ususally the characters don't have time to really develope and grow but I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I bought it with the intent to oly read Christine Feehan's story \\"Dark Dream\\" but soon was pleased to find the other two stories enjoyable to read also.<br />The first is by Amanda Ashley aka Madeline Baker. Its a vampire story & much like the other vampire stories she's written, the hero is the vampire who was turned hundreds of years ago but would give it all up to be human again. The heroine is a modern day actress who is a cast member in his favorite musical, \\"the Phantom of the Opera.\\" He feels such attraction for her that he can't stay away from her but he also knows that he can never have a life with her because of what he is. This story is full of longing and heartwrenching scenes. I really enjoyed the story and was happy I had taken the time to read it.<br />The second story is \\"Dark Dream\\" by Christine Feehan. Its another in her Dark series. I have loved all of her stories and this one was no different. The hero, Falcon is a very ancient Carpathian who comes across a very strong and unusal human female. She has been out running and out smarting a evil vampire for years. She is drawn to Falcon because she has been his lifemate for centuries. Even before she was born he knew her. Together they must defeat the evil and save some very special children. We get to meet up with several characters from the early Dark books. It was nice to meet Mikail,Raven, Jacques & Shea again. These characters are so vividly written and thier stories so compelling that it makes you crave more and more stories.<br />The third story is from an author I'd never read before, Ronda Thompson. Her story \\"Midnight Serenade\\" is a werewolf story. It starts off with the heroine, Stephanie who's a wildlife researcher there to study wolves, scarring off some hunters after a male wolf. They have shot him and she is on his trail to help the injured wolf. She follows the trail of blood into a cabin where she meets Dr. Rick Donovan DVM. Rick is the wolf but he can't let her know that. He doesn't ever remember anything when he turns so he has no clue that he bit her as a wolf. Now he is terrified that she will turn just as he has. Together they struggle for the life and freedom of the wolf. They must also battle thier own feelings of passion and fear. Its a very well developed story for a short story and I think this author will have to be put on my to buy list for the future.<br />All in all I really enjoyed this book.

Ally has had a rough divorce and is tired of \\"pleasing\\" men where Brian aches to have someone \\"please\\" him. You see in his time he is a professional athlete. But not the kind we think of now, you see our sports have replaced with the sport of SEX! Yes Sex! He plays for a team called the Sex Monarchs and was just named MVP(yes there is a joke about that)of the Sex Super Bowl. all his life he has pleased women with his technique but desires nothing more that to be the one pleased by his woman.<br />The sexual inuendos in this book are very funny and made it very enjoyable to read.

About his past assignments, what life is like as a djinn when he's not granting wishes. It seemed to focus more on the heroine, Meredith and her career. I would have liked to see him do a bit more mischief that he seemed to imply was the way of the djinn.

The idea of the &quot;Forever Bride&quot; story is very beautiful and heart warming. I thought the plot of this story that the modern woman, Meagan, goes to Scotland to get married in an old church where the &quot;Forever Bride&quot; tale is said to have taken place, was unique. There she is suddenly flung back in time and ends up marrying, not her modern day fiance, but Robert Cameron, the Laird of Thistledown Castle. Robert has never met his bride to be so is shocked to see that she is not as young as he thought her to be, nor as innocent. He can't deny that he is attracted to her and tries to convince her that she is just as attracted to him. He soon realizes that she is not his real bride and together they set out to find the missing bride. The story is very good for a while and really held my interest but then it started to drag. I put this book down several times and it took days to finish it. I think the ideas of the book were good but not really brought to life.

They are very graphic but they also show that sex is a natural and beautiful thing. I liked the characters and the story line was interesting. I did wish that the heroine was more forceful like she was in the first book. She seemed a bit to demure. She went from being very high spirited to shy. I still found her to be a likeable woman but thought she came across better in the first book.<br />The story starts off with our heroine, Merry, being practically forced into a marriage with a man she likes as a friend but nothing more.

I used to look forward to each and everyone. Well this book was a big disappointment. The plot is interesting although I though it was going to be about a Viking showing up on a modern womans doorstep. Its a sci-fi romance. The Viking is a Very Very tall man named Dalden who has come to our humble little planet to stop a evil man from taking over our planet. Dalden gets our heroine, Brittany to help him. Brittany is a very tall woman who is looking for mister right and can't seem to find one. She agrees to help him, rather quickly. Dalden decides that she will be his lifemate and she doesn't even bat an eye at that. There is a super computer that helps them both named Martha who adds humor to the story which it badly needed.<br />The story doens't have a lot of interaction between the main characters at all.

This one is about an American hero after the Civil War. It was very funny in spots but I didn't really like the heroine in the story. She was too much. The Hero was wonderful and I loved the secondary characters and since I found out this is actually a sequel to \\"Frankly My Dear\\" I'll going to go back and read it.<br />This is a time travel book. The heroine, Harriet ids a modern psychologist who really seems to hate men, in my personal opinion. She has written a book on woman's fantasies and and has determined that it is wrong to have a fantasie about \\"forceful seduction\\". This is not rape but where the man seduces the woman into sex. She has preached against this but can't admit, even to herself, that she has these fantasies. She uses a famous book by Rosemary Rogers called \\" Sweet Savage Love\\" as a bad example.<br />Well when her train is derailed in modern times she awakens back in time in the year 1870. Where she meets the subject of her dreams Etienne. Etienne is undercover working for President Grant and at first thinks she is a spy so he must keep her close, very close.<br />The story has a lot of interesting turns and plots but when it all came to head it was a bit boring. I enjoyed the banter between the two main characters and I loved Etienne's two best friends, Cain and Abel. The book was enjoyable and I'm looking forward to reading the book leading up to it.	2002-05-27

He has returned to Ravenshire to find himself propositioned by and ugly old hag. She wants to marry him in order to protect her young son from his true father. Who happens to be Eirik's enemy. The old hag is no hag though. She is the beautiful, young, Lady Eadyth. She hides her beauty for fear of men making advances on her and hurting her the way her son's father did. She decieves Eirik, who has bad eyesight, into thinking that she is not a pretty young woman, only a desperate old hag who needs his protection for her son.<br />These two go round and round. Both are strong willed and stubborn. They clash several times before the truth is found out. When it is the passions they both feel combine to make them both breathless. The love scenes are tender, exciting and passionate.<br />But trouble is brewing and soon their new found happiness will be shattered by their enemy, Steven. Together they must defeat him so that they can have a happy peaceful life.<br />The secondary characters of Tyrik, Eirik's brother and the children are wonderful. They bring to story a real sense of family.<br />I hope Sandra Hill continues to write more books in this series because its a wonderful world she has created and I enjoy escaping to it whenever I can.	2002-05-19

It wasn't. It took me days to get through this book. I had to force myself to finish it. I was very disapointed in this story. The characters were glossed over. There was no real passion between the main characters. It wasn't very exciting and the ending just kinda left you hanging. I was hoping it would get better and it just didn't. Hopefully her other books will thrill me.	2002-05-14

I was so looking forward to it that I bought it 4 months before it came out. I have always enjoyed the humor and wonderful writting style of Lynsay Sands but this book lacked that humor and style. I did find it somewhat funny in a few random scenes. And i will admit that the love scenes are hot but the plot didn't thrill me. The characters were boring to me and the situations that the heroine gets herself into may me think she was an incredibly stupid woman not one who was supposed to be making it on her own. I'm sorry that this wasn't a better book but I'll still read Lynsay Sands books in the future.	2002-04-27

She falls for him hard and even though he puts her through hell she stays strong in her love.

I have now read two of Robin Schone's books and they just keep getting better and hotter as I go along. Robin blends the erotic love scenes so well with the romance that you feel that the book would be missing pages if they weren't included.

Yes the hero, Gideon is a tormented soul and the heroine, Lucinda is a very caring loving woman who wants to heal him and love him like he deserves, but the characters were blah. They didn't seem to be fully developed. Also the story was a bit rushed at the end. I would have liked the reason for Gideon's torment to be looked into more and maybe showed his feelings of torment and how Lucinda eased that torment more. I just didn't really enjoy this book very much. It had potential but fell short of it.	2002-04-20

His two younger twin brothers have taken the land that the king offered to them as payment for their service, but Lucien only wants Eynsham Keep, their former home. Their father had been killed six years ealier by thier uncle Osric who has taken over the Keep. Lucien and his brother have to flee for their lives. It is Lucien's quest to get the keep and the lands back. At any cost.<br />While visiting his mother and step-father, Lucien goes to a fair and meets a beautiful girl who he thinks is a peasant. He is drawn to her beauty and when they meet again their passion for each other cannot be stopped. Lucien doesn't know the peasant girl is really Lady Adrienne the adopted granddaughter of his enemy. He thinks of her as just Addy. When he learns the truth he knows that this can help him in his quest. He doesn't plan on falling in love with her though which may throw a wrench into his future plans.<br />Addy thinks Lucien is a poor peasant and when they make love she doesn't regret it for she knows that she is soon to marry a unknown, unnamed man of her uncles choosing. She wants just one night of love and passion. Later when she finds out Lucien is a knight  she dreams of marriage to him. She knows nothing of his quest only of his love.<br />Together they must fight for their passion and love and not let old wounds and fresh ones tear them apart.<br />I look forward to reading the stories of the twin brothers and maybe the author will even write about the young half brothers.	2002-04-14

Christine Geehan has a fan for life. I have now read almost all the books in this series so far and I can't wait to get to the next one. Christine makes her characters so human, even though they aren't human at all. I enjoy reading about the Carpathian lifestyle and how its men protect their women to the point of death. The passion that they share is wonderfully erotic and touching at the same time. Its nice to read about men who are just as moved by sex as the women are. Its just as emotional to them as to the women.<br />This is Darius's story. He is Desari's older brother from \\"Dark Challenge\\"...<br />The secondary characters are as always wonderful. I would love to see a few of them have their own stories, hint, hint.<br />I would recommend these books to anyone. I will read and reread them over and over.	2002-04-14

This is the first book I've read by Lisa Cach and it won't be the last. I really enjoyed this book. I liked the fact that the hero was more like an average man. He wasn't extremely tall or very muscular. The heroine was a modern woman who deals quite well with the fact that she has been flung back in time to a period where women were under strct constraints and I'm not just talking about the clothes.<br />The story starts off with Wihelmina, or Elle as she likes to be called, given a note by a homeless person in modern times. She doesn't even look at the paper until she is out with her dog on a walk. The note reads &quot;Coupon Good for: one free husband. Redeem at will&quot;. She looks up into the sky and waves the coupon states the she wants to redeem her coupon. She thinks its just a joke when all of the sudden she is surrounded by fairies and they transport her back in time to be the wife of Henry. Henry's bride to be Eleanor is who she is replacing. Henry has no idea anything is different because they apparently look the same. She decides to go along with it so that she can at least get the wedding. I mean every girl dreams of a big wedding with all the trimmings. Then she will go back to her time. Only that doesn't happen. She seems stuck in 1790 with a husband who she doesn't know but is very attracted to. Henry doesn't quite know what to make of his bride. She doesn't seem like the person he met before but he likes this person better. He is puzzled by her lack of knowledge about running a household and her ideas about birth control but can't help but fall for her. Elle fights her feelings for Henry and when she finally lets him into her heart she thinks that she must leave him and go back to her time.<br />This tale is wonderfully written and it made for a very enjoyable read. I look forward to other books by this author.	2002-04-12

I only wish you could write faster or I could read slower. I read your books as soon as I get them. I even stay up all night and then suffer the next day at work!<br />I was hoping that this book would be Traed's story or possibly another book about Rejar, but when i got into this book I wasn't too disapointed that it wasn't. I am hoping that this book will also have several sequels, hint, hint!<br />This is a sci-fi romance that has a major twist to it. The planet is ruled by women! Yes I said women. I loved it. The women are the strong sex and the men the weaker sex. The women are the leaders, the soliders, the landowners, etc. The men are expected to stay virgins until the wedding and they are the ones who take care of the kids and deal with the household duties. I was a bit odd to see such a powerful hero, Jorlan, being submissive and acting like a virgin, but it made the book exciting and thrilling. Green, the heroine is a powerful leader who decides to claim Jorlan. Jorlan tries to resist this because he has dreams where men are equal to women, boy does that sound familiar? Hummmm. Anyway after he realizes what passion he feels for Green and that she only wants his best interest at heart he becomes more comfortable with his life with Green.<br />During all this Green has a enemy who is trying to take Jorlan away from her and will do anything in her power to hurt Green and her people. Claudine tries to break them apart or at least break Green. Green and Jorlan must learn to trust each other and depend upon each other in order to defeat their common enemy.<br />The love scenes in this book are so beautifully written that they do not overpower the story at all but add to it. There is a lot of Dara's trademark sense of humor and she has developed a truly unique new language. I especially liked the word\\" rut-bid\\" Now I can say what it means and no one will be the wiser.<br />The secondary characters bring the story together and make it gel. I believe there are many new stories that Dara can get out of them.<br />Get this book and every other Dara Joy book you can find. You won't be disappointed.ogether and make it gel. I believe there are many new stories that Dara can get out of them.<br />Get this book and every other Dara Joy book you can find. You won't be disappointed.	2002-04-12

It was a bit hard to follow in parts but the story line was interesting enough to keep me at it. I liked the fact that the heroine is a strong yet vulnerable woman who can stand on her own but also knows when to lean on her man. The hero is a very sensitive man who probably because of his heritage makes him irresitible to his heroine.<br />This is a combo of a timeswept/fantasy romance. The heroine, Taffy starts off in the 1880's and ends up in the 1640's. She is helping her father with his archeology by taking photographs of the bones they have discovered of a piper. The piper was killed after warning of a trap. His hands had been cut off and he bled to death. While taking the shot she sees a ghost who happens to be the piper himself. The piper, Malcolm, is our hero. She is sent back in time to save him by the fairies. She and he both are of fairy blood and the fairies need them.<br />Together they must overcome their human enemies and the fairy dangers which await them. I enjoyed the excitement in this book. You weren't sure what was going to happen next. I plan on reading more of thisd authors works in the future.	2002-04-09

This book has mystery, violence, innocence, longing, and love all wrapped up in a enjoyable story. The characters are a bit undefined and I would have liked a bit more substance to the main as well as to the secondary characters but it still was an enjoyable read.<br />The story starts off with a young woman and an old nun alone as the only survivors of a horrid year. They are almost to the point of starvation when two knights appear. They give them shelter only to regret it. The two knights rob them, kill the nun and beat the young woman. she is only saved by the fact that one of the knights does have some honor. She is found later by Lord Damon of Wulfere. He is shocked to find her beaten and takes her to his home. He was going to the convent to pick up his bride Lady Lorabelle who was residing there. When he finds the woman he beleives her to be Lorabelle because she wears the engagement ring. he is determined not to really care for her but he soon finds himself drawn to her.<br />Belle, as her new husband calls her, must overcome her wounds and become the lady of the keep. she takes his sisters under her wing and tries to make this cold castle a warm home, but the uglyness she has faced before is threatening her happiness. She must gain Damon's trust and love in order for her to prevail.<br />I look forward to reading other books in this series.	2002-04-09

This was the first book I've read by Robin Schone and it won't be the last. I was unsure of what a erotic romance would be. I've read Connie Mason books that have gotten pretty steamy but I was un prepared for this book. Wow! was my first thought! The love scenes are explosive but I was also very please to see that this book had a real plot and tender romantic scenes as well. I enjoyed reading about the characters and found them to be very lifelike and humorous at times.<br />The Story is a time travel out of body book. A modern woman named Elaine suddenly finds herself back in England in the 1880's in the body of a 21 year old named Morrigan. Morrigan has been married to Charles for a year and they just consumated the marriage right before Elaine shows up. Elaine is very disoriented and doesn't understand what has happened to her. Charles is very frustrated becaue the woman he though he had married seemed to have no interest in being married until a year later. Charles is determined to bring out Morrigan/Elaine's passions and sets about to teach her the pleasure that can be had between them. He must also deal with her very prudish family who shows up to take Morrigan back. Elaine soon finds herself falling in love with Charles and joyfully joining him in the pleasures of the marriage bed.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes those steamy romances but also likes them to have strong characters and good plots.	2002-04-06

I really like these Faerie Tale romances that Linda Jones has been writting. This is the 3rd one I've read and I'll continue to buy them. I like the characters because the women are strong yet not over powering and the men are strong yet sensitive. They are protective yet yielding.<br />This is the story of Goldielocks and the three bears. Goldie is Maddalyn Kelly a soon to be school teacher who escapes being killed in a stagecoach robbery up a mountain only to encounter the cabin of the three bears, Karl, Conrad, and Eric Barrett.

Eric is attracked to her instantly but is very guarded around &quot;ladies&quot; and tries to keep his distance. Maddalyn falls for Eric right away but can't tell him because of his feelings towards &quot;ladies&quot;. She ends up playing matchmaker for the brothers and finds herself part of a family who really cares for her. Eric must overcome the way he feels about her before they can find the love they both really need and desire.<br />This book is very touching and I really enjoyed reading it.

It won't be the last because I did enjoy it but it didn't thrill me. I found it to be humorous in some spots and down right boring in others. I liked the hero and the author really developed him well. The heroine left a lot to be desired. She was a cold fish and even during the love scenes I didn't think she thawed any. I also found this story a bit hard to follow at times. It seemed like the conversation would start and stop at the weirdest times and lines seemed to be out of place. I did like the secondary characters in this book and would be interested in reading future books with their stories. Like I said I enjoyed it but it could have been a lot better	2002-04-04

This is the story of Tykir, who is Thork's son from The Reluctant Viking&quot; and younger brother to Eirik and Rain. This book is filled with wonderful characters that show up in previous and later books. The humor was wonderful and the passion was hot! I like the way that Sandra Hill makes the hero and heroine more true to life. The hero has a bad leg and the heroine, Ailnor, has freckles and she is not terribly busty and not super young either.<br />Alinor is sort of taken captive by Tykir because she is supposedly a witch who has put a curse on King Anlaf's privates. He is commanded to take her to the King to remove the curse/spell. She is very reluctant to go and fights but then soon realizes that time spent with Tykir is better than time spent with her brothers who are always marrying her off . She is a widow three times over and really would like for all men to leave her alone.<br />Tykir at first doesn't think she is attractive at all and can't hardly stand to be near her but he soon finds that he likes freckles and her hair drives him wild. Their passion soon flares and turns both of their worlds upside down.<br />The reader is not sure what is going to happen next and it was really hard to put this book down to go back to work after my breaks. I am now going back to read the Outlaw Viking which is Selik's story.	2002-04-02

She is the Daughter of Ruby and Thork from &quot;The Reluctant Viking&quot;. Selik, Thorks friend from the first book is the hero.<br />The book starts off with Ruby and Rain visiting York in modern times. Rain is a doctor and 30yrs old. Ruby's husband Jack who was the look alike for Thork has passed away. They decide to visit because York has set up a museum of old Viking artifacts. When Rain sees one painting of Selik she knows that he is the man who has haunted her dreams for years. She goes back on her own and is transported back in time to the very battle the picture represented. She sees Selik fighting like a mad man and rescues him from the attacking Saxons.<br />Selik is no longer the handsome man Ruby knew. He is battle scarred and has scars that no one sees on his heart. He takes her captive but lets her treat the injured including a young Tykir, her half brother. Selik doesn't really believe the story she tells about being from the future but after a time he comes to accept it as the truth.<br />Selik is a wanted man and must take himself off to protect Rain but she won't have any of that. She decides that she is there to save him and save him she shall, even if he doesn't want to be saved. Along the way we get to meet Adam, who I hope gets his own book and we also find out what happens to some old friends.<br />I really liked the humor that Sandra Hill puts into her tales. The passionate love scenes could burn the paper they are written on. All in all this was a good book and hard to put down.	2002-04-02

They both are stand alone books but it is enjoyable to read about Morgan from the second book in this one and Jack and Lorelei in the second book.<br />Jack is a notorious pirate and Lorelei is helping her English fiance track him down. Jack kidnapps her when he realizes she knows who he really is. He is very strongly attracted to her and she to him but they try and fight thier attraction until passion wins out.

In this book we get Anne's story. She is the bastard daughter of Robert the Bruce sent to live with Elen and Munro from the first book. The hero of this tale is Munro's bastard son. He didn't know he even had a son until Tor shows up after his mother dies. She made Tor promise to go to his father and he feels he must do just that to honor her. He is half viking and holds a big grudge against his Scot father. Munro honestly never knew about him and it makes for a good story to see them become a family. Anne is a very straight forward young woman, she takes after Elen, and she wants Tor. He is also highly attracked to her but they beleive they can't be together for several reasons. This book has  humor and tendersness and passion in it that make it a wonderful story. I loved the fact that the author brought us up to date on what Elen and Munro had done with thier lives and it was nice to see that they still cared as deeply for each other as ever.<br />I also liked the secondary characters of Tor's brothers and would like to read a book about Finn in the future.	2002-03-27

I liked the fact that the heroine in thei book Gwendolyn may be very fragil looking but she is strong in spirit and puts others beforeherself even though the other may not be deserving of it. Alex the hero is a tortured soul after his first wife's death and I liked the way Karyn Monk showed that he had true feelings of loss and really truely mourned his wife even though it was common practice to get remarried asap if children were involved. I didn't like the relationship that Alex had with his sick son and even though it gets better during the story it could have been so much more.<br />I enjoyed this book and will probably get other books by Karyn Monk.	2002-03-26

She has humor, tenderness, true to life characters and she doesn't gloss over the harshness of the historical times of which she writes.<br />This book starts off with Tabitha, a modern day witch. Yes those of us old enough to remember \\"Bewitched\\" from Tv will know that Tabitha was the daughter with the cute little nose. The book actually  mentions that show several times. Anyway she hates her magic because it never goes right. The 1st boy she ever kissed she turns into a frog by accident and it just kept getting worse to the point that she has almost hidden herself away from the world and her magic. Her parents,from \\"Breath of Magic\\" have tried to help her embrace her magic but to no avail.<br />Tabitha learns that her parents are missing and her mother has left her a special message to find an emerald amulet which transports her back in time to be found by her \\"knight in shining armor\\" Colin.

He has returned to find eveything in ruin and his once best friend wanting to kill him.

I love her Viking tales. She brings to life the harsh realities that they faced and gives us just enough actual historical background without making it seem like a history book. I like that she adds humor and passion to her books equally.<br />This book was enjoyable but it did leave me kind of wanting. I just felt like there was something missing. I'm not really sure what though.<br />This is the story of Ruby Jordan, a modern day 38 yr old woman with two kids, a marriage that is failing and a busy business selling and making lingerie. Her husband of 20 years leaves her and she falls to pieces. She is listening to a self motivational tape when she is suddenly flung back in time to the time of the Vikings. There she meets Thork, the look-a-like to her husband Jack. He thinks her a spy and almost kills her. She soon realizes that no one believes her tale of being from the future and that her very life is really in peril.<br />She must learn to adapt to her new life and its harsh surroundings. Thork is not very nice to her even though he is highly attracted to her and she to him. Of course she tries to tell him that he is her husband and that they have been married 20 years ut he can't believe her because he's never married and has no intention of ever doing so and the fact that she appears to him as 18 again.<br />There is a lot of humor and a lot of tense moments where you aren't really sure what will happen next.

Once she does realize it she decided to go find out more info and ends up being kidnapped and taken aboard Morgan's ship, without his knowledge.<br />The tale gets funnier by the page and the passions between the two get hotter and hotter. I loved the secondary characters in this book and I wonder if several of them might not have had thier own books and I may have missed them, I'll have to check.<br />The only part I didn't like about this book was the ending because it came to fast.

I couldn't put it down.<br />The story really is of a fantasy lover come to life but only for 30 days. The heroine is a modern day career woman, a Sex Therapist. She is in realy need of a man and her best friend has found one for her. He's a Greek god in a book. All she has to do is summon him and he will be her love-slave for 30 days. Perfect right? Wrong.

She does it on a lark and is shocked right out of he socks when he actually shows up, naked and willing to pleasure her right then. Julian has been trapped in the book for 2000 years by his half brother Priapus. Julian is the half human half God son of Aphrodite. He is betrayed and ends up in the book only free when he is summoned for 30 days of pleasuring. He has dark demons which he has suppressed and is completely baffled when Grace wants to help him confront them. He also doesn't quite understand that she doesn't want him to make love to her and wants him to wear clothes and even go outside. This has never happened to him and it has got him off kilter.<br />...<br />This was a very refreshing story and I eagerly await future books.

I loved the other two but I really found this one to be the best. This is Hugo's story. He is the younger brother to Rafe who was the hero in &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot;.<br />Hugo has finally decided tho settle down. He has quit gambling and buys an estate. Nearby this estate is a sanitarium which his mother has asked him to visit in order to find out how one of the patients is doing and to deliver a check. He goes very reluctlantly. While there he sees a vision. An angel walks by the window and their eyes meet and he is left very shaken. He can't get out of there fast enough. He flees to London where he falls back into his old life of gambling and now has lost his fortune and his new home in one hand. He must now marry for money. He soon finds out that the angel he saw at the sanitarium is a missing heiress and is very wealthy. He convinces her to marry and the adventure begins. He never really knows what hits him.<br />The angel is Meggie. She is not a patient but an orphan that was sent to work at the sanitarium. She can read minds but when she sees Hugo she can't read him at all. She is very strangly effected by him and when he comes back to get her she thinks he's mad. She has no idea of her new found wealth and thinks he wants to marry her because he has fallen in love with her at first sight. She soon realizes that she loves him but is afraid to tell him for fear of his discovering her gift.<br />There are two wonderful aunties in this story and we get to find out a bit of what has happened to Rafe and Lucy. This story has a lot of humor in it and the love scenes are hot and steamy. I liked the way Katherine Kingsley made both the hero and the heroine human with emotions that can go awry at any time.

I felt like the characters could have been developed more. I would have liked a bit more substance to both the hero and the heroine. I liked them but I didn't really get to know them.<br />This story starts off with the heroine, Taylor Rose, a school nurse, traveling on a train to get back home to San Diego in modern times. She falls asleep and when she awakens and gets off the train she is back in the year 1888. She adapts really fast to her new surroundings, a little to quickly for me. She meets the hero, Jackson, the bartender by accident. He thinks that Taylor is a man because of her pants and short hair. She over hears him making plans to kill Wyatt Earp, his boss. She is shocked and confused about what to do. Her dead father speaks to her and guides her through this situation. She ends up taking care of a madams garden and everyone is now calling her Rose. Jackson falls for Rose and she for him but this murderous plot is in the way of their happiness.<br />I think that this could have been really great and I would have enjoyed it more if it just gave the characters more life.	2002-03-03

This was one of the first Connie Mason books I ever had the good fortune to read and I'm so glad I did. Connie makes her heroines wonderfully strong and her heros just as strong. The characters compliment each other and the supporting cast makes the book come together. I like the fact that there is always a struggle which the lovers must overcome, It seems to make them appreciate thier love more.<br />This book is actually written in two sections. In the first we meet our hero Adam, who is very bitter over what our heroine's father did to his many years back. He is out for revenge. He kidnaps Alexa, placing her aboard a ship captained by the Fox, who is a masked man and he ends up taking her innocence. He leaves her to Adam who also beds her and leaves her in ruins and then leaves her in England while he goes back to his life in America. Alexa is ruined and now pregnant and Mac, Adams friend takes her to Adam. They marry but soon trouble begins. Adam is actually the Fox, who has been aiding the American's in thier fight for freedom from Britian and Alexa is taken prisoner as a traitor for harboring the Fox. She is rescued by the Fox and is totally suprised to find that the Fox and her husband are the same man. She decides right then and there to aid her new country and fool Adam/Fox as well. He leaves her again and she becomes the Vixen. This is where the second part of the book begins. She trains to fight and sail and soon has her own ship and is terrorizing the British as the Vixen on her ship &quot;My Lady Vixen&quot; When the Fox and the Vixen finally meet it is explosive. But the story doesn't end there. There are more troubles ahead and it will take a long while before the two lovers to find happiness.<br />I would recommend this to book to anyone. Keep up the good work Connie!	2002-02-22

This is the second book in a series. the first book \\"In the Wake of the Wind\\" was wonderful. Now is this book we get Rafe's story.<br />He has come to Ireland after his cousin has died leaving him an estate. He finds in horrible condition. His cousin was not a good lord and had spent all the money from the estate on his pleasures rather than on the land or its people. The have lived for quite a while under very poor conditions and they are very suspicious of the British. Rafe, frustrated with everything goes on a long ride and encounters the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, alone on an edge of a cliff, quoting poetry. This beauty is Lucy Kincaid, the daughter of the former Irish lord before Rafe's cousin took over. She has been treated like a servant/slave by her stepmother and her two step sisters since her fathers death 9 years previously. She is very wary of strangers and when he approaches she seems to jump right off the cliff. He is heartbroken to think that she has killed herself and tries to find out who she was. In his quest he pays a visit on the stepmother and somehow agrees to send them to London for the season. They all end up going, to Lucy's bewilderment, and there he unexpectantly comes across her walking in the park. She insists that he is mistaken and disappears again. He then spends the rest of the season searching for her again and again but to no avail. At the end of the season at the last ball he finds her again, she has been given one chance at happiness and gets to go to the ball, and he knows that he loves her and must be with her. She disappears again and this time he finds her again in Ireland. This is a wonderfully touching story and I liked the fact that Lucy was a very strong woman who even though she was in the worst of surroundings took things in stride and kept her pride. I also enjoyed the secondary character of Hugo, Rafe's younger brother. He gets his own book which I plan to read very soon.

This is one of my favorite books by Connie Mason because I love the heroine in this book. She goes through hell, and I do mean, hell to have happiness. The hero in this story I don't really like. He puts her through most of the hell but in the end love conquers all.<br />This story starts out in London in 1759. the heroine, Amanda, has been sent off to get lace to finish a dress her mother is making for a very rich woman. On the way back she is mistaken as a prostitute and ends up being bedded by our hero, Tony. Tony is leaving for the colonies the next moring so she is his goodbye gift from his friends. He never realizes that she is a virgin. After he leaves the next day things go from bad to worse for Amanda. She now must steal so that her and her dying mother can eat. She is caught and soon finds herself on her way to the colonies as an indentured servant. Tony sees her and buys her and on the way home he can't help himself and takes her. She can't really help herself either because Tony does make her burn with passion. She becomes his housekeeper and he treats her very roughly. Finally they realize they love each other but there are a multitude of horrible things that will try and stop them from marrying. All throughout the book Amanda remains strong and I did like Tony some of the time. He got better. This book has very hot love scenes that could burn paper. You won't want to put this down until you've finished it.	2002-02-19

She steals from him and leaves him bloody and bested by a woman only to show up again at his castle in his bedroom. She flees after a struggle with a very naked James. She is soon caught though and he has her thrown in his dungeon. He soon finds himself commanded by his King to marry her. He is stunned but more so she.

This book was a disappointment. It dragged. I didn't like the love scenes. I really disliked the hero and the heroine didn't make me proud either. I wish I could have liked this book but I really didn't.<br />The story starts out with the heroine being held captive by a ship of bloodthirsty pirates who will kill her after they have had thier fill. She decides that in order for her to survive she must attract the captian and become his whore. The hero is now the captain after having killed the former captain. He decides to take the captive woman up on the invitation her eyes are sending him. He never realizes that she is a virgin and believes her to be a well practiced whore. After several days they near shore and she manages to escape. He searches for her and when he finally finds her he stalks her. This book protrays pirates as they probably really were but I don't think it made for a nice enjoyable romance.	2002-02-12

First off I have to say a big &quot;Thank You&quot; To Teresa Medeiros for writting a book with a real sized woman and for having a man who willingly admits he likes larger women. Yeah! About time!. I also liked the fact that the heroine in this story has the same fears and thoughts about her body as modern day women do. It made her so real.<br />This is the story of Gwendolyn, a virgin who has been sacrificed by her villiage to the Dragon of Castle Weyrcraig. Only the Dragon isn't really real its Bernard the thought dead son of the dead lord. He was thought to have been killed 15 years before by the British. He somehow survives and is now using the Dragon to terrorize the village for its betrayal of his family.<br />When he finds Gwendolyn tied up to a stake as an offering her is furious but she calms the Dragon and soon works her way into his heart.

I loved it also. This book is the story of Faith, a modern woman who works for British Intelligence and is sent on a mission to Ireland. She is positioned in a famous Druid circle of stones. There she meets up with the terrorist she was seeking and a struggle ensues. Somehow they are both sent through time to Ireland in the year 1648. The terrorist runs off and she is found by the handsome Miles O'Bruaidar, who is also known as the Irish Lion, a man who has been causing havok to the British who are invading. She at first doesn't realize she is in the past and when it finally hits her she fears revealing it to Miles, although she trusts him with her life. Together they must over come her fears, The hated British, the traitors to the Irish and many more to stay together. This story made me cry and laugh and I would highly recommend it.	2002-02-10

They looked at the title and I could just tell what their thoughts were. &quot;Hummmmmm, she has to read a book about how to marry? poor girl.&quot; Well anyway their thoughts kind of go along with how the heroine felt in this book about the book she found&quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot;. The heroine, Elizabeth, is working as a companion for Lady Danbury. She has to work to make because she is the sole support for herself and her three younger siblings. She has come to the conclusion that she must marry for money to support them but doesn't really have a clue as to how to become married. That's where the book comes in.<br />Now the hero in this story is The Marquis Riverdale, James. You will remember him from the first book in this series&quot; to Catch an Heiress&quot;. He has come at the request of his aunt Lady Danbury to solve her problem of blackmail. He has taken on the identity of James Siddons, the new estate manager. He is quite taken by the clumsy Elizabeth and when he discovers her plan to marry he agrees to help her find a suitable husband. But all the while he is becoming more and more attracted to her and she is having the same feelings for him. Finally they act on their attraction for each other but before it can end happily ever after all hell breaks loose. This is a funny story and I was please to see characters from the previous book make appearances. I would enjoy reading books about Elizabeth's siblings so I'll keep my fingers crossed. I have enjoyed all of Julia Quinn's books and would urge anyone to buy them all.	2002-02-09

I love secondary characters in this book and am still hoping with fingers crossed that two of them will get their own story. Get these two books and enjoy them.	2002-01-14

I liked the Little Red Riding Hood twist to it. The Heroine, Molly is a sweet, giving, innocent, loving girl who meets up with the Wolf(thats his name) while walking to her grandmother's house. Wolf is a man who has lived the past 7 years being ridiculed and shunned by stangers and even his so called friends. He is determined not to love Molly. Not even to need her. He marries her with the intention of just bedding her and then leaving and going back to his life in NYC, but somewhere along the way Molly gets under his skin. He suddenly finds that he does need her and takes her along with him to NY. They have many obstacles to over come before they can find the love that they both need to survive. I enjoyed this book and will probably by more of Linda Jones's books.	2002-01-13

I have read several of Christine's Dark series so I knew that this would be a page turner and it was. This one is a gothic historical romance. It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it  but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte, or in English palace of death, to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done. There are some very interesting secondary characters that I think would make good heros and heroines for possible future books. Get this book. You'll really enjoy it.	2002-01-12

I had previously read Rejar and was at first a bit confused by the references that it made to this book. Now I understand it all. This book is a timetravel book that has our heroine, Deana, having a really rotten day. She's been fired, had a horrid experience on the subway, had to wait for an accident to clear before she could get to her car and was rejected by three editors! She finds a junk shop and while waiting for her car to be released she buys a old necklace. When she gets home and cleans it up she finds out its really a beautiful piece of jewelry. She then suddenly finds herself face to face with the hero, Lorgin. He is drop dead gorgeous! She realizes that he isn't from here but a real life alien! They go to San Fransico for a scifi convention and he fits right in. Then suddenly she is wisked away to another planet and becomes involved with his quest. We meet Yaniff, the old mystic, Rejar, the half man-half Familiar, and Traed a loner who has many demons to conquer. Lorgin teases her and makes her smile so much that she is falling in love with him. I liked the way Dara described the love scenes as being both hot and breathless but tender and gentle at the same time. I can't wait to read more in this series and until they come out will be reading several of her other books. This is a definate buy!	2002-01-12

His traveling companions Rowland, Kendall and his squire Ulrich are the best of friends and thier loyalty to each other is plain to see. William takes as his bride the orphaned Cathryn.

Well now that I've read it I wish I had spent my money on something else. This book left me cold from chapter one. The heroine in this book, Golde, is a foul mouthed, crude, hateful mystic who has been telling fortunes even though she cannot see the future. She agrees to help the Baron of Skyenvic, Gavarnie, the hero who is blind for a price. There is an evil plot and it seems to take forever to find out who is behind all of it. There are some mildly funny parts to this book but they are few and far between. I was really disappointed in this book.	2001-12-29

I have enjoyed all the books even though they take me at least two days to read. Christine Feeham brings to life the Carpathian male so well that you dare not skip a single word. This is Gregori's story. We first meet him in Dark Prince. He is the hunter for his people. He has spent over a thousand years hunting down and killing those of his own kind who have turned vampire and those human vampire hunters who wish to erase all the Carpathians from the earth. He is very close to turning himself as he waits for his lifemate Savannah to grow up. She is the Daughter of his Prince Mikhail and his lifemate Raven. Gregori gives her 5 years after she turns 18 to be free before binding her to him. She flees to the US and becomes a famous magician. When he can wait no longer he claims her as his and the sparks fly. She is very independant and he is over protective. Together they must find common ground so that thier love can grow. She is his light and he struggles with the newly found emotions she brings out in him. I loved the tug of war between them when she wanted to do something and he was reluctant to allow. Together they must fight to save themselves  as well as their people. I look forward to reading about them and all the previous characters in Christine's other books.

Humor. The first book I read of hers &quot;Always&quot; was packed with humor and it made the story so memorable. This book was sadly lacking in it. It made for a good read but I don't think I'll reread it anytime soon. I liked the hero, Galen with is rare red hair. He seemed fair and gentle. The heroine Kyla is a strong willed wounded woman who was Galen's equal. I wish there had been a bit more conversation and maybe a bit more of a struggle between the two before they fell in love. I did enjoy the secondary characters in this book. The were the only humor to be found.	2001-12-24

This one was ok, not great. The back cover sounded better than the story turned out to be. There really wasn't much interaction between the hero and the heroine. Even the love scenes were so mild I wasn't sure that they had done anything. The Hero Dain has agreed to marry the daughter of his enemy to settle a feud that has been going on for generations. Emma, the heroine is sent instead of her 7 year old sickly sister. She is a magician but fears that if she tells Dain the truth he will hurt her in some way. She falls for him and he is hopelessly drawn to her even though he fights it. I didn't like the fact that he had very short cropped hair which looks like on the cover like it's been bleached. He looks too modern. I think this could have been a better book with a bit more passion in it and more interaction between the main characters.	2001-12-23

I liked the fact that he was both human and cat, I'm partial to cats. But it was a bit confusing on how he ended up in Regency England.

Oh my what a hunk!The Second was the story. I liked it  but was left wanting a bit more.<br />The story takes place in late 1460 and early 1461 in England. The hero The earl of Lynchburg(David) is queen Margaret of Anjou, King Henry the VI's wife, champion. He has won many a battle for her and now is waiting to be rewarded with land. She marries him off by proxy to Lady Jeanette, the Earl of Cornwich's daughter. When he arrives at his new home he finds that Jeanette can never be a wife to him but he is trapped and must have an heir in one years time. This is where the heroine comes in. Her name is Riley and she is the daughter of the slain Lord Snowden, who was killed because he fought for the Yorkist. She is masquerading as a servant and went sent to the new masters room to attend to him she tries to kill him. He is very attracted to her as she is to him. He places her in the dungeon but then thinks up a plan in which she can live and he can enjoy her. She will have his child and he will present it as his wife's. She agrees to this to live and is determined to hate Lynchburg. Only she finds herself falling in love with him. He also is falling for her even though everything seems to be trying to tear them apart from each other. The love scenes are very hot, almost burned the pages. I would have liked for a bit more dialog between the two main characters. The seemed to fall for each other on pure attraction rather without much conversation. I would still recommend this book and I look forward to others by this author.	2001-12-18

I mean Karen has a drop dead gorgeous hero and there is not picture to bring him to life. Oh well I did pretty good with her discriptions and my imagination. Ah those men in kilts! :-) This is another time travel book which I love. Gwen the heroine is a 25 yr old vigin that intends to find her&quot;Cherry Picker&quot; on a trip to Scotland. The only problem is that all her traveling companions are over sixty. She has accidently been placed on a senior citizen tour. Well on top of this she's trying to quit smoking! Anyway she decides to go off on her own for a hike near Loch Ness. She happens to fall down into a cave and onto the hunkiest man she's ever seen. He is laying there like he's dead and when she leans back to let the light shine on him while she is feeling his chest he awakens. Drustan, the hero, imediately gets aroused by her presence on his body and doesn't realize what has happened to him. He has slept for the last 500 years in that cave. He is a Druid lord who has special abilities and knowledge that must be protected. He must find his home. Well the trip there is wild. First Gwen must get him some new clothes. The scene with the jeans is not just sexually steamy but down right funny. I know I'll never look at men in jeans the same way again. Well they soon find his home is now just ruins and he knows that he must go back in time to save his family. They end up making love and binding themselves to each other before the spell. She is torn from Drustan and fears that he never made it. She end up back in his time and has to convince the Drustan of the past that she is there to help save his family. It takes quite a bit of convincing but when she finally does they realize that they love each other. But they have now changed the past and the future may not turn out like they planned. The secondary characters in this are wonderful. I loved nell and Silvan and can't wait for Drustan's brother's story.

I have loved all of the other books that I have read by Lynsay Sands. They have been filled with great humor and wonderful plots that had me wanting to call in sick to work just to finish the book in one setting. This one didn't. It took me three days to read. I liked it. It was a good story but the humor wasn't present and it could have been filled with it. The love scenes were ok but not special and the whole plot left a little to be desired. I would still recommend this book but it wasn't one of her best. I'm now going to start her book Sweet Revenge. I hope its better.	2001-12-10

This book was great. I was so happy to find out what had happened to Brandon and Heather. The only thing I didn't like was that this book came out before &quot;A Season Beyond a Kiss&quot; which is Jeff's(Brandon's brother) story. The love scenes in this book are as hot and sensual as all of her other books. Beau is a wonderful hero  just like his father.

When I first got this book I didn't realize it was a part of a series, when I did I put it up until I could read the other books. I'm glad i did. It made much more sense to me when I knew who Adam was and What a Berserker was. Even though the first two books take place after this one I could tie them in very well. This is a time travel book. I love time travel books. I wish that there had been more discription of Lisa's(the heroine) transition into 14th century life. Plus when Circenn(the hero) goes forward in time his transition. The love scenes in this are great even before they actually happen. The two have fantasies about each other which are quite steamy. I like the fact that the hero hasn't been with a lot of women. It makes him seem more real. I liked the secondary characters of Galen and Duncan who I have a suspision are related to Hawk in Karen's first book. I would dearly love to read books about them finding love. Especially Duncan who has &quot;had&quot; almost every willing maid he can find until he seems to meet his match in a mysterious woman named Elizabeth MacBreide. She seems like a match for him. This is a good book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes tender but fierce warrior hero's and mischevious fairies.	2001-12-10

Well I must say that I have loved every book this woman has written. It all started twenty years ago when I read &quot;The Flame and The Flower&quot; I was hooked. This is Jeff's story and there are only two things that bothered me about this book. One was that &quot;The Elusive Flame&quot; which is Brandon's son's story came out before this and in it we found out that Jeff had married Raelynn and that they were deeply in love so we knew that everything had worked out well before this book made it's apprearance. The second was that this book seemed to start in the middle. The are already married and its a bit confusing finding out the whys and the hows. I did like the secondary characters in this book very much. I will still recommend this book to anyone but I think I'll tell them to read it before reading Beau's story.	2001-12-10

I will definately buy other books by Rebecca. This book is a fantasy historical. The heroine is a fairy. Her name is Splendor. She is a fairy princess who has been chosen to conceive a child with the human Jourdian, the 12th Duke of Heathcourte. She has only has three months in which to do this. If she doesn't do this the fairy world will end. They need the half-human baby to strengthen them and the kingsom will again be able to have children. So she goes to the human world naked and lands atop a shocked Jourdian. She proceeds to send his orderly world totally upside down. When her best freind, a shape shifting animal shows up in the house, you never know what it will be. One day a pig the next a donkey and so on. She is seen by the vicar naked and now a scandal is afoot. Jourdain marries her to save her reputation but she can't abide by the scratchy clothing so she marries him in one of his silk shirts and nothing else. The love scenes are hot and sensual and make a person sigh. Splendor's sister Harmony who is very mischevious shows up and causes havoc, even going so far as to turn Jourdian into a snail! She then falls for Jourdian's best friend Emil. This story is so endearing to me I can't wait to read it again and again. If you get a chance to get a copy of this book buy it and never lend it out, you might not get it back!	2001-12-08

Well the wish is for Grimm to find a woman who would heal his heart as Hawk had healed hers. Well Grimm did. He has a secret though, one that he is terribly afraid to reveal. He is a Berserker. He flees his home at a very young age after seeing his father holding his dead mother and dripping in her blood and holding a knife. Then his home and villiage is attacked and he becomes the enraged beast like Berserker. He flees vowing never to return. Well He spends a few years on his own until he is discovered by a beautiful little girl and her family takes him in. They train him and provide for him and the little girl falls in love with him and follows him everywhere. But when his foster family is attacked he turns Berserker again and now flees them so that they will never know his dark secret. He loves the girl but believes that if she knew the truth she would turn from him in horror. Plus he is desperately afraid that he might turn Berserker and accidently kill her.

Oh my was my first thought when I started to read this book. After just two chapters I was totally hooked. I have now read the first three in the Dark series, the first Dark Prince, then Dark Desire, and then Dark Gold. I have several of the others and am waiting for one that I just recently ordered.<br />Well at first I couldn't quite tell what the hero of this book was. He had the ability to transform himself to a wolf, owl and even into just a mist. He drank blood to survive but wasn't a vampire. He was a Carpathain. He was old, the oldest of his kind and their Prince. Mikhail was very lonely and had long ago lost all his emotions. He was close to turning into a vampire(one who kills when he feeds and enjoys it). He was considering going into the light and ending his torment when he started communicating with a human woman by the name of Raven.She is a telepath who has been hunting down serial killers and has come to the Carpathian Mountains to try and relax and come to find some peace. She can't touch people because she picks up their thoughts and it can hurt her. She feels Mikhail's pain from a great distance and longs to comfort him. She is unaware that he is being hunted by her fellow travelers and when she finds this out she becomes hunted also because of her association with Mikhail. He has found in her his true lifemate. The one who can bring emotions back to him. His kind are slowly dying out because there are only a few women and most only give birth to male children. They have tried to convert human women before with tragic results but with Raven's telepathic abilities the conversion goes fairly smoothly. Mikhail wants to protect her but soon finds that she can handle herself and learns that they both must give a bit if this love is to survive. The love scenes are hot and wild and then tender and touching. I look forward to all of the books in this series. I would recommend them to anyone.	2001-12-04

The heros are Carpathian. They must drink blood to survive but they don't kill their prey like true vampires do. They can transform into anything and have telepathic abilities. They also have a big problem, their race is dying out. There are very few women and when they have children most don't live past a year and most are born male. They have recently discovered that a few human women can becaome thier lifemates. These women are telepathic and can survive the conversion without going insane. Our heroine in this book is such a woman. Alexandria is a struggling graphic artist in San Fransisco. She is trying to raise her younger brother alone after their parents died. She ends up being kidnapped by a vampire( a Carpathian who has turned to the evil) and he has exchanged blood with her. She is rescued by Aidan who after almost killing her(thinking she was a vampire herself) must give her blood to kill the poisen the vampire gave her. She goes through the conversion but not willingly. She hates what she is becoming and hates Aidan for turning her this way. He has realized that she is his true lifemate and struggles to protect her in this modern world. She is stubborn and insists that she be able to have her freedom. She soon discovers that she is very strongly linked to Aidan and like to tease him and longs to hear his laughter. She is unaware that he hasn't had any emotions for over 800 years until she cam into his life. Together they struggle to find even ground. He has been hunting several vampires that have been preying on San Fransisco and when one takes her brother he uses all his strength to save him. Alexandria sends him her strength telepathicly and together they kill the evil. This has been the funniest of the books so far and I enjoyed it a bit more because of it. I can't wait to read Gregori's story next. If you want great books get the Dark series, it won't dissapoint.dissapoint.	2001-12-04

Unfortunately the book doesn't live up to its potential. I liked the main plot but the author didn't spend much time describing the characters, the scenery. She left you hanging.

I laughed so hard that I kept getting strange looks from people. Julie Kenner brings to life a wonderful fantasy about a man and his cat. Nicholas a big time lawyer has a cat named Maggie who he loves. Maggie loves him too but more than just as her owner. She loves him as a woman. So she asks the wise old one eyed tom to make her a woman so that Nicholas will love her back the same way. He grants the wish but there are conditions. She is only a woman at night and turns back into a cat during daylight. Also Nicholas must say he loves her by the end of Halloween in order for her to stay human, otherwise she will revert back to being a cat and remain a cat forever. She agrees and soon finds herself a beautiful woman, a naked woman on Nicholas's doorstep. When he answers the door she pounces on him, literally. He freaks and leaves for his best friends house. Hoop is a great secondary character and so is Deena, Nick's sister, I wished that their had been more to their story but maybe we can get a sequel. The story is very refreshing and makes one really believe that magic does exist. I loved the part about the kitty treats. Definately buy this book and reread it again and again.	2001-11-18

Both are thrown into a marriage by the King and neither really wanted it but when they come together they explode. I liked the hero's best friend Raj but other than him the secondary characters don't have much to do in this story. This is a book I'll read over and over. I loved it.

They are filled with humor and passion. The heros are strong yet caring and gentle. The heroines are spunky, willful, almost modern in thier self reliance. The combo of the two makes for great stories. I would recommend any of her books. You'll love them.	2001-11-15

She adds humor so well that it has caused me to laugh at loud and get strange looks from passersby.<br />In Bliss she has the hero the Lord &quot;hammer&quot; of Holden being wedded to his neighbor the Lady&quot;Tyrant&quot; of Tiernay, after the King who is tired of the feud between the two decides to wed them and le them be each other's problem not his. Well since neither can refuse the king they must go through with it, or at least make the other try and get out of it. Hethe, the hero, decides that he cannot anger the king and since the heroine is beautiful it wouldn't be that great a hardship to go through with it. The would be bride has other ideas. Helen, the heroine, thinks that she can make him back out by playing all sorts of wicked tricks on him but they unfortunately backfire on her and she finds herself wedded to her handsome but supposedly horrid neighbor. Soon though she finds out that he is not the cruel man he has been rumored to be and he finds that he has great feelings for her.

If it hadn't been for that pesty thing called work and the fact that I need to eat and pay rent I would have read this straight through. I first discovered Lynsay Sands with ALWAYS and I've loved every book since. I love the humor she puts into her books. This one had me laughing out loud and getting strange looks from people. Her heroine in this book is very strong and has a innocent but experienced air about her. She gets herself, her twin sister and the hero into tons of trouble all the time. She seems to collect poor unfortunate souls and gather them together to make for a wild household, much to the dismay of the hero. He takes it all in stride though and eventually comes to the conclusion that he likes the way she helps all her &quot;strays&quot; as he calls them.<br />Now at first the heroine is dressed like a boy called Charlie who is traveling with his twin sister Beth. Actually Charlie is Charlotte but out hero has no clue but is very upset when he finds himself strangly attracted to Charlie. He even finds himself attracted to &quot;Beth&quot; at times and at other times he feels nothing towards her more than friendship. He doesn't realize that the twins have been switching places. When he finds out the whole truth he is greatly releived.<br />On the whole I loved this book and will read it again but I wish that there had been a little more romance between the hero and the heroine. They are actually together more when she's dressed as a boy than as a woman. Other than that I would highly recommend this book and any other of Lynsay Sands books.	2001-11-10

I first found Lynsay Sands when I read ALWAYS and I fell in love with how she makes the heroine so innocent and yet so strong at the same time. She has done the same here. The Heroine, Emma, has been married for 2 years but her husband won't &quot;do it to her&quot; so that she can have children. She believes that the marriage was consumated but in reality her idea of consumation of a marriage is a bit lacking, that is until she finds herself newly remarried  after her husbands death to Amaury. He is quite relieved to find his bride quite lovely and is willing to consumate the marriage but hates that he has to rush into it.<br />The two are very attracted to each other and when they do make love its explosive which thrills her but perplexes him. He thinks that a lady shouldn't enjoy making love and is concerned that he has corupted his own wife. How soon he finds out that this is not true and how very lucky he is.<br />This is a wonderful book. I read it in one night, in fact I just finished it and its 2:00 am! Definately get this book and any other of Lynsay Sands others books. I'm going to start THE SWITCH tomorrow and knowing me and these books I'll finish it tomorrow night.	2001-11-08

That didn't happen. I liked the Hero, Jamie, but I found Jix, who is the supposedly impish heroine, a bore most of the time.

He has been married 4 times and all of his wives have died leaving him with 7 children. He really loves his kids and it is enjoyable to read about him playing with them and even accepting their pets. One of his daughters has a huge, and I do mean huge, collection of cats. I think the count is 25 or more. He even carries one around for a bit and seems to enjoy loving it.

She loses her hearing, or at least most of it, in a gunpowder accident when she's a child. She learns to adapt though by reading lips quite well. After she looses her mother in another mill accident she goes to work for an elderly couple. She encounters the hero when she is trying to save a drowning puppy and falls in the water herself and almost drowns. He fishes them both out and agrees to keep the puppy for her until he finds a new owner. He keeps coming around her and eventually they get caught in a compromising position. He marries her and takes her with him to his home in Maine. After she finds out that he really doesn't love her she denies him her desire but not his bed. He wants her to be the loving and passion filled wife of their first days together. He struggles with his feelings for her but soon finds that she is all he wants. She even saves him when they sail to England to rescue his brother and the hero gets arrested himself.

It had a good plot and I liked the way that both the hero and heroine were actually in love before they made love. It made the love scene all the more sweeter.

I first picked up the book because i love it when the heroines are not just innocent but also innocent of how the act of love is performed. Rosamunde has been raised in a convent all her life and when her father the King brings her intended husband to wed her she asked her fellow nuns what will be expected of her. Well the way they explain lovemaking to her made me laugh so hard I cried. And then when she's finally alone with her husband who under the time conditions placed upon him by his King cannot take the time to really teach her the art of love making, she endears herself to all the readers. Soon though she does learn from her husband and he is delighted to find her a willing and apt pupil. He is very jealous of any males coming near her and has to learn the hard way that she really has no intention or desire to be anything but his. She tries his patience and it makes for an exciting book. I can't wait to read Lynsay Sands other books.	2001-10-28

This story was nice. I thought the story dragged a bit and that the hero was a bit too moody. I wish there had been more humor in the book. I really think that the last book in the series &quot;The Ravishing One&quot;will be the most enjoyable because the hero and heroine seem to be at odds with each other from day one, which makes for a stronger story.	2001-10-26
