It was a very personal book on many levels.<br /><br />In reading some earlier reviews, I understand why some readers had issues with it. For the previous books in the series, author Laurie King made the mystery the main focus. In \\"Locked Rooms\\", however, the investigator (Mary Russell) is the main focus and the mystery is in the background. I think making the book more personal in this particular way was necessary. The character of Mary Russell had come to a point in the series where she needed to deal with her past. There was no way she could do that as a totally objective investigator.<br /><br />The author also made this book more personal in regards to the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. It is not dryly described but instead vividly recounted by various individuals. It made it more human in the same way that Ken Burns' documentary about the Civil War took an impersonal historical event and turned it into regular people saying \\"this is what I saw that day\\". With the descriptions by Mary's father, I felt like I was there, climbing thru the rubble and dodging the flames.<br /><br />I think if this book does have a fault, it's that the main villain kills off a few too many people. I think that [*SPOILER*] he could've left Micah Long's wife and Mary's doctor alone, and the story would still have remained intact.	2005-08-29

While I liked \\"Dance of Death\\" overall, I thought there was a little too much of Pendergast and D'Agosta running around and avoiding the law. The authors could've cut back on that just a wee bit.<br /><br />I don't think the character of Diogenes was fleshed out quite enough. By story's end, we're still going mostly on Pendergast's assertions that Diogenes is a dark and terrible figure. I think the more interesting part of the story, when it came to Diogenes, was when it was revealed that [*SPOILER*] he was also Hugo Menzies. The authors should have explored that avenue a little bit more, since the \\"two\\" characters are polar opposites of each other. Maybe in the next book.<br /><br />I like how the authors brought in characters from their other books. I would've liked to have seen more of Corrie. Since \\"Still Life With Crows\\" is the first book by Preston and Child that I read, I am kind of partial to her character. I think she actually deserves a whole book for herself.<br /><br />By the time the book ends, you're very much aware that the authors are setting things up for a sequel. While its predecessor, \\"Brimstone,\\" was like that a little bit, it stood on its own more than \\"Dance of Death\\" does.<br /><br />While this book throws us a few bones about the past of Pendergast and his family, it's nowhere near enough to satisfy the reader. I hope that we will learn more about them in the next book.	2005-08-19

I liked this most recent installment of the series. In retrospect, I see what Rowling was trying to do with \\"Order of the Phoenix\\"--set the stage for Harry's entrance into the world of adulthood. That book planted the seed that even Hogwarts wasn't a haven from the rest of the world. Rowling continues that theme even further in this book. I will be curious to see how, or even if, Hogwarts is worked into the final book in the series. I suspect the school will play little to no part.<br /><br />Rowling also continues the evolution of her characters as people growing towards adulthood. She touched upon this in parts of \\"Goblet of Fire\\" and \\"Order of the Phoenix,\\" and has taken it to the next level with \\"Prince\\". Harry even finds his true love and it's not who you'd think, based on the previous books. In fact, I believe the origins of the relationship go all the way back to \\"Chamber of Secrets\\". I won't spoil it and say who it is, but the way the relationship unfolds was one of my favorite parts of the book.<br /><br />The character of Harry is going to undergo a real test in the last book. He will no longer be able to rely on the advanced magic skills of others, but will need to rely on his own skills alone. It will be interesting to see how he fares and if he has learned enough.	2005-08-17

I picked up this book not expecting much but walked away pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I read all 300-plus pages in one day, but for a quick read this book is surprisingly textured. Nan Bacco is not a predictable character and I found myself wondering what was going to happen next. Plus, not all the stories had a happy ending, which was a brave thing for the author to do.<br /><br />At the end of the book, my reaction was \\"What...it's over?\\" I think that's the biggest compliment a reader can give to a book.<br /><br />I hope they do sequels. They would definitely be worth reading if this book is any indication.	2005-06-20

I remember reading this book when it first came out around 1988 and thinking, wow, Stephen King should stay away from science fiction...because he's not that good at it.<br /><br />Somewhere in the first half of the book (or maybe even in the author's note), King explains the meaning of the term \\"tommyknockers.\\" Basically, they're the spirits of dead miners who haunt the mine they died in. I think something following this concept would've been a lot more interesting and a whole lot scarier.<br /><br />I agree with some of the earlier reviews that this book seems very fragmented. There are a lot of interesting side stories, but they don't necessarily contribute anything to the story as a whole. The parts that describe the town's history fall into that category. (Bor-ing!)<br /><br />If King ever decides to do a rewrite of one of his novels, this would be the one. I think he could do some great things with it. In its current incarnation it belongs under the \\"what was he on\\" category.	2005-04-27

I think that too much of the story was: (a) getting to the meteorite and (b) getting it onto the ship. I would've liked to have seen a little bit more of the story take place after they got the meteorite.<br /><br />I wasn't pleased with the ending either. It seemed to come out of nowhere and the main character really didn't put forth any evidence to support why he thought the meteorite was \\"hatching.\\" I recall reading another review on Amazon that compared the ending to that of a 1950s science fiction film and I have to agree. It seemed like it was either tacked on or simply not fleshed out enough.<br /><br />I am not trying to put down the authors. I've read \\"Still Life With Crows\\" and \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" and liked both of them very much. I just don't think \\"Ice Limit\\" was quite up to par with those other books.	2005-04-11

After finishing the final \\"Dark Tower\\" book, I must say that I came away with mixed feelings.<br /><br />On the one hand, I did like how King brought in characters from his other works such as Ted from \\"Hearts in Atlantis,\\" Dinky from \\"Everything's Eventual\\" and Patrick from \\"Insomnia.\\" I'm surprised that he didn't bring in Jack Sawyer, since \\"Black House\\" seemed to figure so prominently into the \\"Dark Tower\\" mythos.<br /><br />The part with the Breakers was also interesting, though not what I expected. You come to find them sitting around in a study, whereas the impression I got from \\"Black House\\" was that they were toiling away someplace like that hell pit in \\"Talisman.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, I do agree with some of the earlier reviews about the ease with which the villains in this book were dispatched. The way King hypes up characters like Flagg, Pennywise/Dandelo and the Crimson King in his other works, you'd think they'd be a little bit harder to off. Mordred was kind of a letdown too.<br /><br />Of course the real villain of this piece, surprisingly, turns out to be the Dark Tower itself. The fact that the Tower has been sending Roland around in a time loop for who knows how long is a very depressing way to conclude the series. I suspect King did this to give himself a loophole by which he could do more Dark Tower stories if he wanted to.<br /><br />On the whole, the conclusion to this series was not bad but not good either.	2004-11-22

I finished reading \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" recently and overall the story was quite good.<br /><br />While I was surprised at first to see Harry's character losing his temper so much, I think that in the end it probably made him more real. If I went thru what he did, plus having to put up with the Dursleys, I think I'd be in a bad mood too. It makes his character seem less perfect and more human.<br /><br />It's also interesting to see Harry as a teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Might be a sign of what's to come for him.<br /><br />Also liked that Harry was able to see his father thru Snape's memories. I think it mirrors that moment we all have in life when we discover that our parents are real people after all, ones who make real mistakes just like the rest of us.<br /><br />The experiences that Harry has trying to understand girls resonates, I think, with all of us, young or old. The comment that girls should write a book about how they think and act so that boys can understand them is very funny. And a little bit true. (Maybe Rowling should think about writing such a book as a side project.)<br /><br />From a technical/writing standpoint, Rowling's great dialog and short paragraphs make for a quick reading pace. That being said, \\"Phoenix\\" is still a very long book (over 800 pages). I think she could've tightened up the story and cut about 200 pages.<br /><br />With the discovery of the \\"kill-or-be-killed\\" prophecy about Harry and Voldemort, the story definitely has a more adult tone to it now. It will be interesting to see where Rowling takes things over the remainder of the series.	2004-10-04

I read \\"Mountains of Madness\\" a few years ago and very much enjoyed it. I believe it may have been my first Lovecraft book. The whole concept of evil aliens on Earth during our pre-history was a new concept for me as a reader. Lovecraft certainly presented it in a spooky way. It certainly reminds you of the fact that we weren't always the dominant species on the planet.<br /><br />There are two things that have occurred in recent years that make \\"Mountains of Madness\\" seem eeriely prophetic:<br /><br />- First, Lovecraft portrays Antarctica as the site of first landing by alien life. And where did NASA find the meteorite that proved the existence of life on Mars? You guessed it...Antarctica.<br /><br />- Second, Lovecraft talks about the aliens retreating from their Antarctic city on the surface to one within a lake that is deep underground. Within the last few years, scientists have discovered Lake Vostok, which exists several miles beneath the Antarctic ice. The ice above it is several million years old.<br /><br />I think the highest rating I give books on Amazon is four stars. The only reason I am giving this book three is that I do agree with some of the other reviewers that Lovecraft's language does slow you down a bit. Luckily, the concept of the story more than compensates for this.	2004-09-24

It was a good inside view of how Amazon operated and grew.<br /><br />I must admit that it brought back memories of my own experiences during the dot-com boom. During a similar timeframe (about four years), I saw gameplans change frequently and before I left saw the generalist, non-tech people like myself replaced by the techno-elite. These phenomena seem to have been more widespread than I realized at the time.<br /><br />The author does go off on some diversions here and there during the story, but for the most part I was able to get a feel for what it was like to have worked at Amazon during that time.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to others. The writing and language makes it very easy to get thru quickly.	2004-09-02

I just got finished reading &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; and from a technical standpoint, there were some pluses. I think Stephen King must have listened to his readers, because this book was just over 400 pages, as opposed to the last one, which went over 700 pages. And the 400 pages in &quot;Susannah&quot; made for an easy read. I finished it in only a couple of days.<br /><br /> Technical pluses aside, I was not terribly drawn into the story. First, the fact that the story keeps going back to New York City and to some of the same characters says to me that King has just run out of ideas.<br /><br /> Second, I agree with some of the other readers and reviewers that King writing himself into the story was a mistake. Part of the original appeal of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series, going back to the first book, was the otherworldliness of it. When you read &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; while there were some touchstones to our time and reality, you felt like you were somewhere else. King presence as a character does nothing but diminish that sense of otherworldliness and glaringly reminds us that this is indeed a story. Considering all of the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; themes he uses, I'm surprised he forgot the basic concept of &quot;never let them see the man behind the curtain.&quot;<br /><br /> I don't think I'm alone in thinking that the series started to tank after &quot;The Waste Lands.&quot; All I can say is the last book better be good.	2004-07-23

While I am neither a huge baseball fan nor an expert in statistics, I nevertheless found the blending of the two subjects quite captivating. I also found the style of the writing that author Michael Lewis uses to be very conversational and accessible to the reader.<br />I can see why this book, and the events it chronicles, caused such an uproar in the baseball world. The crux of the conflict seems to be theory vs. theater. The approach of Billy Beane and others has proved that using certain statistics to choose a team and project where they will go during the season is a valid, successful approach to the game.<br />However, there is a case to be made for their opposition's claim that such an approach takes the flair and theater out of baseball. I recall that someone once said, \\"We don't know how the game will turn out. If we did, it wouldn't be worth playing.\\" It's that peppering of random chance that creates the theater of a baseball game. Sometimes the crowd wants to see flashy, dramatic and unexpected plays.<br />My sense is that ultimately some combination of the statistical and the traditional will come about. That team managers will be able to use both the flash and the stillness to achieve victory.<br />I definitely recommend this book, whether you're a baseball fan or not. Also, if you are interested in reading about the inside story of the bond markets during the mid and late 80s, Lewis's first book, \\"Liar's Poker,\\" offers the reader the same accessible style.	2004-05-13

This book was quite scary. And it wasn't even fiction, which made it all the more frightening. (I also found it equally as frightening that at least two of the previous reviewers spelled &quot;Manhattan&quot; incorrectly as &quot;Manhatten.&quot; It's called a dictionary. Look into it.)<br />In addition to hearing about how seemingly easy it was for David Hahn, the radioactive boy scout described in the title, to obtain radioactive materials from regular, nonrestricted products, I was just as surprised and shocked to hear about some of the other, larger nuclear accidents of the past few decades, some of them not well publicized.<br />While I was aware of Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and some of the others, there were incidents from the 1960s such as the British Windscale plant and the breeder reactor around Detroit, which I'd never heard of.<br />(While the author is at it, he might look at Brookhaven National Labs in NY. Given the cancer clusters in the areas around it, I'm sure there's a book there too.)<br />I did see that the main story of David Hahn didn't take up a huge amount of space and that there was some padding with other, related material. However, I don't think that diminishes the impact of the story. The lesson here is that while nuclear planners have strategies for regulated, large-scale nuclear accidents, small-scale efforts by individuals seem to have been left out of the equation entirely.	2004-04-06

In reading some of the earlier reviews of this book, as well as those of its predecessor, \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" I agree that \\"Blood Canticle\\" has the look and feel of a first draft. If Anne Rice had put it away for a bit and then come back to it, I believe she could've corrected many of its flaws.<br />One subtle thing that bothered me right off the bat was the style of language used by Lestat's character. It is markedly different than his speech in the other books and his new style of speaking, saying things like \\"babe\\" and \\"cool,\\" really doesn't work. He sounded more like Austin Powers than he did Lestat.<br />Something that could've been developed a lot more were the references to \\"Memnoch.\\" For example, there's a reference made in either this book, or \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" to Lestat's mind or consciousness being \\"stolen\\" by Memnoch or other angels. To what end, the reader isn't told. This seemed like an obvious point to follow up on and I was disappointed that it wasn't.<br />I was also disappointed to see the pages that were wasted by the appearance of Patsy's ghost. In my mind, that whole tangent added nothing to the book.<br />And finally, I had read a rumor that Anne Rice was going to use the Blackwood saga to delve into the origins of the Talamasca. I was quite disappointed to see that she didn't do so in either of the books. The organization's beginnings are discussed somewhat in the \\"Witching Hour\\" trilogy (it is hinted, by the Lasher character, that it was started to breed Taltos), but, I think, never fully fleshed out and explored.<br />In conclusion, I believe that this book is rife with missed literary opportunities.	2003-12-18

In my opinion, it suffered from the same problems as &quot;Wizard and Glass,&quot; which were too much backstory and it being too long.<br />While I know that Stephen King can go on for a few more pages than necessary, I really think this story could've been told with a hundred or even two hundred less pages. I don't think the extra pages, or the story as a whole, really contributed to the reader knowing much more about the Dark Tower than we did in &quot;The Waste Lands,&quot; which in my opinion is the best book in the series.<br />While I am looking forward to the next book in the series, I hope it's better than this one.	2003-12-01

There were shades of the Lasher character from \\"The Witching Hour\\" in the spirit character of Goblin. And the ending steered towards making someone a vampire, which seems to have become a very stock conclusion for Rice's vampire books. While it was new in \\"The Queen of the Damned,\\" using it again in \\"Tales of the Body Thief\\" and \\"Armand\\" AND \\"Merrick\\" is a bit tired. To say it's formulaic is an understatement.<br />Another thing this book had in common with \\"Merrick\\" is the revelation that Julien Mayfair is an ancestor of the main character. I thought Rice had done a good job of building up the history of the Blackwood family as a separate and distinct entity prior this revelation. I don't think it's necessary to pull out this \\"Julien factor\\" every time a character with witch-like powers appears.<br />If Rice is looking for new ground to cover, I think she should look at exploring the history of the Talamasca a bit more. She made a good start of it in some of her earlier books, but its exact origins would be interesting to hear about. Another topic, which Rice has curiously ignored, is what happened to Lestat's mother, Gabrielle. That is another character we would all be curious to discover more about.	2003-10-31

She begins, in the series, as knowing faith from a single perspective, the traditional Bajoran view of the Prophets. However, being away from Bajor forces her to make her faith something more universal and flexible. It ties in nicely with the schism of the Bajoran faith that was introduced in the \\"Avatar\\" books and continued in the \\"Mission Gamma\\" series. Opaka's experiences offworld have prepared her for what's happening on Bajor. However, I don't think it's a sure bet that she will become kai again when she returns. In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion she will choose not to be kai if it comes down to it.<br />I also liked the revelation that Bajor is not the only world that has been visited by the wormhole aliens. That dovetails with a mention made at the end of the \\"Gateways\\" series, where an Iconian comments to Kira on the worlds (plural) that the wormhole aliens watch over.<br />I am still waiting to see if Benjamin Sisko reappears. But even if he doesn't, the Deep Space Nine series still has legs.<br />It should be interesting to see what to do with \\"Unity,\\" the next book in the series. The Ascendents and parasites are lurking in the background as some potentially nasty enemies.	2003-09-22

I found myself zipping thru the dialog in much the same way I would with a John Grisham or Stephen King novel.<br />In terms of the book's resolution, I would've liked to have seen Sherrie's brother and Kyle's partner Mac brought into the final scenes in the epilogue. It would've been nice to know what happened with them. I was also curious to know what Kyle told the Sinclairs about their daughter.<br />Overall, though, a good job by James David.

While I enjoyed Little's novel \\"The Store\\" and thought his short stories in \\"The Collection\\" were okay, I was not really impressed with this book.<br />In my opinion, Little goes for the gross out factor far more then he should. It seems like that's all there is to the story and it just becomes too much. I think he's kills off too many of the main character's friends and allies too. Again, too much.<br />There's also a problem with the main character himself. I was halfway thru the book and was still asking myself why I should care what happens to the main character and his wife. Little just didn't do enough to get the reader emotionally invested in the story.<br />Little definitely has skill as a writer and comes up with some original ideas. However, his execution of those ideas still leaves a lot to be desired. \\"The Store\\" shows that he's done it well once. It remains to be seen whether he can do it again.

And while I joke around that one day everything is going to be owned by a single company, &quot;The Store&quot; takes that to a frightening extreme.<br />I agree with one of the earlier reviewers that certain things, like the origin of the Store's owner, don't get explained. However, I don't think that those elements prevent this from being a good read.<br />I just wish that some of his other books, like &quot;The Town&quot; and &quot;The Association,&quot; were as good.	2002-09-09
US	50810132	RDD0K127KFZO1	0671775235	278628929	The Valiant (Star Trek The Next Generation)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Putting together the pieces.	I enjoyed this book very much. I liked finding out how the character of Picard became the person, and the captain, we see today.<br />It was very enlightening to see the way that he looked for a balance between the command style of his captain and the first officer of the Stargazer in terms of developing his own style. He wasn't as reckless as his captain, but neither was he as &quot;by the book&quot; as the first officer. He saw what and what not to do, which is something many of us, including myself, have learned in our own lives.<br />One reason I give this four stars is because of something that is true of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; books. The authors of these books count upon the fact that you've watched the show (in this case &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;) and thus eliminates the need for setting up the characters, since there is already a &quot;history&quot; behind them. We already know who they are and what they've done.<br />A similar &quot;biography&quot; that I would recommend is &quot;Mosaic,&quot; which looks at the history of the character of Janeway. While I was not a huge fan of &quot;Voyager&quot; (the stories were a bit weak), this book was also very enjoyable, giving insight as to how the character developed and why they act and think they way they do.	2002-08-29
US	50810132	RS0UICVU26G0	0595222919	933049822	Black Light	Books	2	0	0	N	N	It had a good start but then...	&quot;Black Light&quot; gets off to a good start. I like the way the author brings the dotcom world into the story. The character development is pretty good too.<br />Once the two main characters head to Massachusetts though, things start to fall apart. The characters didn't really seem to develop for the rest of the story. A lot of what they did and said seemed very one-dimensional.<br />I was especially disappointed with the ending. It seemed very derivative of other books I've read and movies I'd seen, and was very predictable. Plus, the time travel element seemed like kind of a cop out, as if the author had gotten to that point and then didn't know what to do next. An example of how a time travel element was better used is at the end of Dean Koontz's book &quot;Lightning.&quot;<br />This author has potential, but needs to flesh things out better in their next novel.	2002-08-23
US	50810132	R38HHCJH1X52ZV	0595220576	495203197	Of Caves and Caving: A Way and a Life	Books	3	4	4	N	N	I felt like I was there.	Author John Gillett does a good job of describing the caves he's visited during his long caving career. When I read about his adventures, I felt like I was there right along with him.<br />If there is a fault with this book it's that the cave visits end too quickly. There is a subtle, just-another-day-at-work-in-the-cave tone to the chapters. I know we can't all be Shakespeare, and Gillett does do a better job than most, but I just can't help feeling that this story is missing an element that could've made it a five-star book.<br />On the whole though, it's a good read and I recommend it highly.	2002-08-23
US	50810132	R1K69Z1SA3C8ER	0595123015	208278438	Midnight Radio	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Basic story there but could've been developed more.	\\"Midnight Radio\\" has a good premise--a radio station being haunted. And the author made some good choices relating to the characters, namely that the main one, Ryan Knox, is suffering from real problems in the midst of encountering this haunting.<br />The only problem is that the author misses some key instances where the story could've been developed a bit more. Ryan's wife is only minimally developed, so that I'm on the verge of caring about her loss, but am not quite there. Perhaps some flashbacks with dialog would've helped. There's also a scene where Ryan's doing an aside to the reader about a co-worker, Dave, and how he introduces him to his wife. Personally, I think doing this totally spoils the surprise when we encounter the woman later in the story.<br />It's a decent book, but it's definitely not best seller material.	2002-08-23
US	50810132	R28AQ3FNG5YREC	0345450884	431887144	The Lake of Dead Languages	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Has potential but needs more.	I agree with an earlier reviewer, who said that the author here spent too much time describing and not enough time telling. And I think that did make this book drag in a few places.<br />While it was a good story that Carol Goodman came up with, she could take a lesson from one of my favorite authors, Stephen King. King's style concerning dialog is what stands out about his writing, not whether the story's about a possessed car or a mad dog. The dialog flows, you can actually picture people talking like that, and they tell you what's going on. Goodman's story could use a bit more of that.<br />I'm also not sure if the stuff about the relationship of three of the characters to the founder of the school really added anything to the story.<br />Overall, it was a good, but not great, book. This author has potential.	2002-07-30
US	50810132	R1E32DFRCFVGI2	0060182970	552239081	Coldheart Canyon: A Hollywood Ghost Story	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Inflated and without enough substance.	While it was good to read a novel by Clive Barker again after such a long interval, I have to say I was disappointed by &quot;Coldheart Canyon.&quot; It was a good concept--movie stars staying young as a byproduct of a magical, slowed-time prison--but not one suited for a 600+ page novel.<br />This concept had the earmarks of being a long or short story or novella. It seems like it was inflated to fill out a whole book. I never really felt invested in what happened to the main characters, especially Todd Pickett. And the character of Tammy seemed suspiciously like one of the female characters in Everville (not Tesla..her name escapes me). It makes me wonder if that's how Barker sees women in general--the earth mother image.<br />My point is that I think Barker can do better than he did.	2001-12-17
US	50810132	R3IOI92CJBZNPR	0804735220	563886471	The Conquest of the Last Maya Kingdom	Books	4	1	1	N	N	This should be a movie.	I just finished reading \\"Conquest\\" and I must say that the story it tells has many classic elements to it. While author Grant Jones is concerned with getting all the facts, dates and listing of sources right, I found the drama behind his words more exciting.<br />The real story of Nojpeten, the last Maya kingdom to be conquered by the Spanish, is better than fiction. There are political machinations on both the Spanish and Maya sides. Unfortunately for the Maya, the political machinations on their side, namely that their king had essentially lost control of his kingdom, spelled their ultimate doom.<br />While it is not certain that, in the long run, the Spanish would've maintained their promises of not using force in terms of dealing with the area, attacks by Maya kingdoms adjacent to Nojpeten created the perception that the Maya were not to be trusted.<br />Overall, I found the information in this book very useful. I found it helped me understand the Maya as a real people, with family and political problems just as we do today. I'd say the only other book that does a better job of describing these elements (on a grander scale) is \\"Lost Chronicles of the Maya Kings\\" by David Drew.	2001-05-08
US	50810132	RDRGF2AV428I3	0312872038	524593072	Ship of the Damned	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Author is making progress.	This book is a definite improvement over James David's last novel, &quot;Fragments.&quot; The author's skills as a horror/thriller writer are definitely improving. There is a little more attention paid to character development, although part of this is due to fact that many of the same characters from &quot;Fragments&quot; are present in this one.<br />&quot;Ship of the Damned&quot; does stand well on its own though. The world that the author creates, the bubble universe in which the ship of the title resides, is compelling and draws you in, as do the people who have been trapped there. It does beg the question of what would happen if a group of people developed psionic abilities. You definitely find out here.<br />While the author has refined his skills somewhat, I believe he can refine them further. I would recommend that he observe the way that authors such Stephen King, Robert McCammon, Anne Rice and Clive Barker create characters. While I admit that King and Rice can get a bit long winded some times, on the whole they get you emotionally invested in the characters and let you get to know them as people.<br />If James David can fully master this trick and couple it with his very original concepts, he'll be golden.	2001-01-14
US	50810132	R9TSTPOSM38SV	0060194952	449760045	A Fish Caught in Time : The Search for the Coelacanth	Books	4	7	7	N	N	It kind of makes you wonder.	I had read an account a few years back about the initial discovery of the coelacanth off the coast of South Africa and the tracking down of its habitat to the waters around Madagascar. It captured my imagination.<br />It was great to find out that the story didn't end with the Madagascar discovery. Upon reading this book, I was thrilled to hear about the confirmation of coelacanths living off Indonesia. The theory put forth in the book that there might be populations in the Philippines or even off the Atlantic coast of the United States stirs the imagination as well.<br />The book is very easy to get thru. It gives you just the right amount of scientific information and includes more human elements, namely the stories of the people involved in discovering, studying and protecting the coelacanth.<br />Something like this definitely makes you wonder. I mean, if a fish that was thought to be extinct for millions of years escaped detection by humanity till the beginning of the twentieth century, what else might still be out there?	2001-01-14

Not since Michael Coe's &quot;Breaking the Maya Code&quot; have I found a book on the Maya so exciting to read and so easy to get through. David Drew doesn't bog you down in academic minutae.<br />I found two things in this book that were particularly fascinating. One, that the Maya were not a single pre-Columbian empire, as is so often portrayed, but rather a set of city-states involved in constantly shifting alliances with other political entities. It made the Maya seem that much more accessible and real as people.<br />The second item I found fascinating was the fact that the Maya city of Tayasal survived into the period of the Spanish Conquest, while the bulk of the Maya world, and its once proud city-state, had collapsed several hundred years earlier. I am curious to read more about this particular city in a book by Grant Jones.<br />I highly recommend this book to all those interested in the Maya. It is a good read and you don't need to be an expert on the Maya to enjoy it.	2001-01-14
US	50810132	R3HJ4DAQ5O0FYD	0812571479	339023614	Fragments	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Interesting concept but not well executed.	\\"Fragments\\" offers an interesting concept, the fusing of the minds of several savants in a collective intelligence. However, a concept is not enough to sustain a book.<br />In my opinion, the problem with \\"Fragments\\" is a basic one. The reader never really gets to know, or care about, the characters in the story. Part of the problem may be that there are too many characters to keep track of. In any case, the people we meet in this book are never really fleshed out.<br />I think James David has some potential as a horror/thriller author. I think he just needs to refine his writing a bit first.	2000-12-07
US	50810132	R28J14DMEIQH8I	0679454489	312807149	Merrick (Vampire Chronicles)	Books	2	0	0	N	N	I've seen this ending before.	While I enjoyed pieces of this latest book, there were two things that Anne Rice could've done better.<br />The first was that she brings up this whole ancient civilization in Central America that is \\"Olmec or Maya, but neither.\\" We do not learn anything more about this mysterious culture that Merrick's ancestors came from, which I think could've been developed a little bit more.<br />The second thing was the ending. She introduces a new character, in this case Merrick, and then turns them into a vampire at the book's end. In light of the fact that this happened in both \\"Tale of the Body Thief\\" and \\"The Vampire Armand,\\" its sad to say that Anne Rice is getting a bit too formulaic.<br />If Anne Rice wants to come up with a good novel, she should explore the character of Gabrielle, Lestat's mother, who is also a vampire. She is only briefly featured in the earlier books and I think there's much more to be fleshed out there.	2000-12-07
US	50810132	R1DJFB28N4SO30	0691002304	616770371	Cradle of Life: The Discovery of Earth's Earliest Fossils	Books	2	3	7	N	N	Interesting topic, presentation needs work.	While the whole topic of microfossils dating back 2-3 billion years is fascinating, the way the information was presented here was, unfortunately, less than stellar.<br />I'm sure that for those with a more science-based background than I found it very readable. I, however, did not. The first few chapters were easy to follow, but from there it was like reading a very tedious college textbook.<br />I don't doubt that the author knows his stuff. I just wish he had written in more accessible language. Creating more of a narrative feel might have helped to draw more people in.	1999-12-15
