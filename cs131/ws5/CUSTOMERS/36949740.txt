US	36949740	R2V2SLNII7EAAG	0140177396	371714764	Of Mice and Men	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	CLASSIC SHORT STORY	In this short story, Steinbeck describes the friendship of two very different men during a period of migrant farm work in early 20th century California.  This friendship is marked by a shared dream to buy a small plot and \\"live of the fat of the land\\".  The two characters could not be more distinct -- one, George, is a short wise man, with rugged and sharp features; the other, Lennie, is a large and strong man, gentle but with very limited wit.<br /><br />Steinbeck's description of characters and nature is very simple and clean, especially of the other farm workers in the farm where Lennie and George are just arriving.  It is a world of loners, like Candy who is injured and old but still looking for a place where he belongs, and Crooks who is a deformed black man who is ostracized by the other workers (and carries a lot of resentment for it) and buries himself in books.<br /><br />There are quite a few underlying themes in the story, most of which question the value of life and dreams, especially as one is getting old or one's dreams seem to be fading away in a second.  Lennie is caught in a situation where his great dream to tend rabbits in their land is shattered by an encounter with the wife of the farm owner's son that gets out of hand, and so the story unfolds to its tragic ending.<br /><br />The ending is exceptional, shoking and leaves one reconsidering the book for a while.  The most impressive characteristic of the ending is the lack of change in style; Steinbeck continues its clean and direct prose and is able to construe a believable and meaningful ending in just a few pages.<br /><br />I highly recommend this short novel, it is a little over 100 pages and you should be done with it in a 2-hour flight.  It is a great intro to Steinbeck's writing style, which, along with The Pearl, in my opinion, makes a great combination of Steinbeck's short tragic stories.	2005-08-27

In the book, as he develops the tools and presents them to an audience of generally non-economists, it becomes clear that this is a book about investigation on certain phenomena through logic rather than anything about economics in the traditional sense (hence the funny name of the book).<br /><br />This is an entertaining read overall, though there are some (serious) lapses in writing.  Sometimes the book sets in one direction, only to not answer the original question but a different sometimes more interesting one.  For example, in the last chapter, they seek to understand if a child's name sounding black hampers a child's future; they do not answer that question satisfactorily I think, but rather develop a system to understand the naming logic, which is for names to move from the upperclass to the lower classes.<br /><br />Along with this book, you may enjoy The Economics of Life, by Prof Gary Becker, which is more about economics and has many more stories than this one.	2005-08-14

She was only a young woman when she first got in touch with Jim Jones's temple and got involved deeply with it.<br /><br />The book is written in a way that the reader can follow each step of a member joining the cult, so we can track every single decision made and question it.  It is interesting to note, following her narrative, that there seemed to be no highly unreasonable decisions, just a sequence of commitments that drove the temple members deeper and deeper into the psychological orbit of the reverend.  From San Francisco to international banking transactions to hide Jim's money, to obsessively worrying about an imminent governemtn attack, the reader follows people who would otherwise be reasonable and kind doing outrageously aggressive and violent actions, even including physical torture.<br /><br />There is also, unexpectedly, a high suspense section in the end, when Deborah escapes the compound in Guyana to try to come back to the US.  Though I suppose she is a first time writer, she was quite capable of transmitting the gut wrenching circumstances of her escape.<br /><br />This is an eye opening book, one that you will find yourself thinking about for at least a couple of months after reading it.	2005-08-14
US	36949740	RF2S3OL8TJLD2	0812967267	122882533	Adventure Capitalist: The Ultimate Road Trip	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	ENTERTAINING TRAVEL WRITING	Adventure Capitalist is an entertaining book on Jim Rogers' second trip around the world.  Jim is a former Wall Streeter who made a bunch of money in the market and now does what he wants.<br /><br />I think the book has three sides to it:<br /><br />1. Regular travel writing - he tells us about being scared, happy, worried, touched, etc. while visiting strange and interesting places.  From this portion of the book I picked up a couple of places I would definitely like to see, such as Timbuktu (yes, it does exist and he went there).<br /><br />2. Investment analysis and advice - he goes around looking for investment opportunities around the world and, whenever he sees something he likes, tries to put some money in it.  Examples (sucessful and otherwise) include contraceptives in Korea, diamonds in Angola, among others.<br /><br />3. Economic and political prophecy - as an economist myself, I find that he has read the first chapter of the econ book and decided he knew enough about it.  Though he is often correct in his analysis, at certain points he makes wild predictions that could not be swallowed by a good economist.  He also exercises some political prophecy - he thinks most of the countries he visited are going to split up, among them India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Indonesia, most of Africa, etc.  Though he is right that many countries face internal tensions among racial and social groups, he is too simplistic in stating that so many will break up.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book to pick up if you are looking for a nice quick read.  I also suggest it as a fun way to learn to spot investment opportunities.  I think Jim is a great investor and he shows us why in this book; he also shows us the mediocre political scientist he is, but that is another story.  Fun, fast, and not to be taken too seriously.	2005-07-20

The outstanding characteristic of this little book (I was done in 2 days) is that it does not rely on an opposive state (as does 1984), but rather on a society that chooses to distance itself from books.<br /><br />The basic irony in the story is that, after houses were made fireproof sometime in the future, there was no more job for the firemen.  As society sought to occupy such spare capacity, it chose to eliminate books, as they constituted a hazard.  To me, the most outstading part of the book is Bradbury's description of how man turned away from knowledge, starting with minorities feeling oppressed by those who \\"knew more\\".  In order to achieve happiness, society had to eliminate the feeling of inferiority some people had, and such inferiority was largely linked to books.<br /><br />The most interesting point, however, is that this book was not rendered false by time; the future depicted is quite similar to one we see today in the world and in the U.S.  We have people who are not knowledgeable about an ongoing war, despite being aware of it; there are people outside the country who hate us, but we don't really know why (remind you of anything?); there is a growing sense that we are not free to express our views in fear of offending someone; and lastly, TV and instant gratification is suplanting the need to know and deeply understand the world and who we are.<br /><br />In the book, it took a young girl and an old professor to awaken our hero, Guy Montag.  Though we are not yet burning books, it seems like the general direction was correct.  I highly recommend this book; to me, the best test is the fact that, after reading it, I really wished I had written it.	2005-05-16

In this illustrated book, he attempts to capture the social, economic and environmental reality of the estuary region of the Amazon river, where it meets the Atlantic Ocean.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully illustrated book, with the pictures going a long way in capturing the reality of the region.  The region is quite peculiar even within the Amazon in that it suffers the influence of the Ocean, with ingredients such as daily tides and beaches that are not common elsewhere in the Amazon.<br /><br />The social and economic contrasts are vast: on the one hand, there is the city of Belem, with over 1 million people and a cosmopolitan feel to it; on the other hand, you have the people who live in the banks of the thousands of rivers that crisscross each other on the way to the Ocean, living very simple lives, often without electricity.  The book depicts, with few words and many images, the distinct local living conditions.<br /><br />The environmental aspect, which makes the region all the more interesting, is present throughout.  Despite an economy heavily dependent on natural resources, especially in the Marajo island, the author presents an ecossystem that is often well integrated with man.  For example, he demonstrates how people survive off gathering acai (a local plant), crab or eels, in such a way that the resources are naturally replenished.<br /><br />The sweet sea is clearly a distinct region from the rest of the Amazon, and hence deserves unique attention.  The books gives one a full view of life there (human or not), which is quite amazing.  I highly recommend this book for the armchair voyageur, or to someone considering visiting Belem and surroundings.  It will definitely give you a perspective that most of the locals don't even have.	2005-05-15

There are chapters on children and education, marriage and choosing a wife, sadness and how to cope with it, death; basically, all major emotions and events in life.  The chapters are full of anecdotes, which make for a very vivid way of teaching.<br /><br />Though I am not a deeply religious man, I certainly appreciate the comfort provided by the book.  It is not restricted to Jews, though I think Jews would be more familiar with the stories.  It does an attempt to reconcile religion with science (a feeble one, I should add), being this I think the only more controversial part of it; otherwise, I can almost picture the old man whispering in my ear, pointing in the direction of righteousness and goodness.	2005-04-30

Willy Loman is a man of high self-esteem and expectations, who always waited for the big hit to occur, yet it never did.  He then gets to late in life and looks around to find all those whom he admired and didn't had made something of themselves, while he was still in the same salesman position he was in as a young man.<br /><br />The book switches between his memories and reality, which reflects his true state of mind, being linked to what is perceived as a glorious past in many different ways:<br /><br />- He was an extremely well liked person, had great connections, which was the basis of his self-esteem.<br /><br />- His sons were outstanding and capable of taking on the world.<br /><br />That glorious past was pitted against the crude reality:<br /><br />- The world changed and he knows no one anymore, which coupled with his old age, makes him unproductive and leads his to be fired from his long time job.  He is fired by the son of the company founder, who had made him many promisses and kept his hopes up, hopes which were not fulfilled.<br /><br />- His son is a poorly adjusted man, never being able to focus on anything, preferring to go west for long stretches without accomplishing anything meaningful in Willy's eyes.<br /><br />Willy gets trapped in an imaginary world, swithcing from the reality of his and his family's shortcomings and the potential that layed before them as young men (his and his sons').  This is a short but densely written story, one of those few that will open a small window into a failed man's heart and let you peek inside.	2005-04-19

The best example I found was used in many different chapter, was that of department stores being moved to high margin clothing by discounters and category killers.  The disruptors came in and took the most undesirable parts of the business and built a model to make it economical.<br /><br />The most brilliant insight, however, I found to be the effect when the disruption is complete, that is, when the original incumbent is driven out of the market.  Then margins fall precipitously, since the marginal cost now is at the disruptor rather than the disruptee.<br /><br />A manager facing a disrupted industry would do well to read this book.  In it, there are simple pieces of advice on how a company should organize to gain the agility to implement a disruptive model, even if originating within the incumbent.  You will read it and immediately start looking for disruptions all around you, eager to find one that can be exploited.  The model developed is very interesting, as the authors spend quite a bit of writing on the underpinnings of the theory.  Overall, it is a very useful book, though if you are a practical businessman (rather than one interested in and who finds theories helpful) you will likely not enjoy it.  Theorists in business would be the best atrget audience.	2005-04-19

I was proved wrong by this little book by Mrs Truss.  In it, she details the history and usage of each of the main punctuation marks, making use of typically sarcastic British humor.<br /><br />Her outrage at poor punctuation is a bit overdone and gets tiresome for all but the most passionate readers, but she can be pardoned for she wrote a book that will certainly have a very positive social impact; I am hopeful it will become mandatory reading (the first mandatory book to be well liked, perhaps..) for young children as a way to convince them not only to use good punctuation, but also to pursue good style and follow long held traditions, as these are strng arguments made in the book against modern random usage of punctuation in the internet age.<br /><br />If you have 3-4 free hours, just pick up this book and you will be entertained.  I personally got a bit tired of her sarcasm and had to put it down and pick it up a few days later to finish it off.  I would have liked to have given her 4.5 stars, but the level of research and flow of most of the book push it over the top to a 5 star rating.	2005-04-19

The book focuses on the life of Billy Pilgrim, a simple man from the US midwest who is a soldier in WWII.  The defining moment in his life is his presence , as a prisioner of war, in Dresden during the allied firebombing that killed over 100,000 people.<br /><br />The novel has a matter-of-fact attitude towards terrible events, in a sense subscribing to the notion of fate being inevitable.  In a couple of different places it urges one to act on the things one can change, but then seems to say nothing can be changed.  Vonnegut blends in science fiction to get this point across, as Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens who can travel through time and see everything, but can change nothing.  What they do is choose to see only the good things in life.<br /><br />There is also a deep comedic sense in it, though one is prevented from laughing by the sheer horror of the situations.  It is quite a different depiction of life, fate and war, a very innovative way of seeing the world.  This is definitely an interesting book, one that is clearly written from an experienced point of view (Vonnegut was himself in Dresden during the firebombing).  I highly recommend it, especially since it very short, one that could be read in a two to three hour flight.	2005-04-10

This book compiles Zola's letters (public and not) during this period, with the most famous being J'Accuse, one that earned him a conviction along with stiff fines that eroded his fortune.<br /><br />Zola is very passionate in Dreyfus' defense, though his passion never leaves behind a devastating logic that made it so difficult to ignore.  This is an amazing defense of religious freedom and justice, against prejudice and hatred.  Zola manages to weaken, in time, two of the most powerful institution in France at the time: the military and the church.  Ten years later the military would no longer play as significant a role in French life, and by 1905 France would pass the law separating Church and State.<br /><br />After reading the letters, one is filled with Zola's enthusiasm and idealism.  Makes one want to go fight injustice and make this a better world.  There are very few books about which this can be said.	2005-03-28

I am somewhat biased to speak about it, as I am the grandson of the author.<br /><br />The book focuses on tracking the history of the Jewish migration that took place mostly in the 19th century from Morocco to the Brazilian Amazon.  These immigrants were and are an integral part of the communities today living in the region, though the vast majority either live in the largest cities (Manaus and Belem) or have moved to Rio or Sao Paulo.  There are tables listing all the families that migrated to the region, as well as lists of all burials in local Jewish cemeteries.  It also explains a bit the motives behind the migration (anti-Semitism in Morocco coupled with economic opportunity in Brazil).<br /><br />If you would like a copy of this book, I would be happy to get one for you, just send me an e-mail.	2005-02-11

Its theme is a Golem, a mythical figure imbued with life by cabalistic magic to help the Jewish people in a time of need.<br /><br />This story begins with persecutions on Jews in Prague, which is when the Golem is sent to Reb Leib.  After helping the Jews in their objective, Reb Leib decides to use the Golem, with its incredible strenght, for a less noble pursuit, which is when the Golem starts to disobey him.  The story unfolds with the Golem, a creature made of clay, turning more and more human, with the mauturity of a child but enormous strenght.  The probelms mount as the Golem destroys all in his way, falls in love (reciprocatedly) and gets drafted by the emperor.<br /><br />The short story evokes many deep issues, such as what it means to be human, what one should do with unending power, what one should do to preserve the peace, and many others.  Though originally a childrens story, any adult would enjoy it.  It is the type of story that leaves one reflecting about certain issues for days.	2005-02-09

With it, this book shares the brilliance and throughness of thought employed by Friedman, perhaps the most well known (if not the best) economist of the 2nd half of the 20th century.<br /><br />In \\"Money Mischief\\" Friedman enters the realm of monetary economics, briefly telling a history of the different systems that have been employed through history for value conservation.  Aside from perhpas the first 100 pages, the rest of the book relies on some notion of monetary economics and international trade and finance.  Most of the book is devoted to the study of the old metallic or bimetallic standards and the early days of the fiat money system (the one most used today).  An experienced economist will recognize the brilliance of the arguments linkings seemingly unrelated events such as the US elections in 1892 and the fall of the Chiang Kai-shek government in China (believe me, Friedman convinced me they were directly linked).<br /><br />For a non-economist, the first one hundred pages may tell a brief history of money, so if that is your interest, stop there.  Experienced economists will definitely enjoy the suddle linkages of events, such as deflations and the California gold rush and the development of the cyanide process for extracting gold.  The book is aimed at a more knowledgeable crowd; with such an aim, it achieves its objective brilliantly.	2005-02-09

Retail is not one of the traditional industries focused on by SAP and its system shows a strong bias for manufacturing, so I was hoping this book would shed some light on the capabilities of the system that were being underappreciated at my company.  Well, the result was that I was quite dissapointed after reading through it.  First, the book seems to have been written in German and translated (poorly) to English, because the language is very choppy.  Besides, there book lays out a grand vision of the architecture of the system without giving the user much idea on implementation or actual utility of functions.  If you are ready to invest a few million on new developments, maybe this book is for you, but if you are looking for small improvements and ideas for medium-term development, this book takes too much of a birds-eye view to be useful.	2005-01-25

As a popular science reader, one cannot help noticing, about hlfway through the book, that the understanding of an amateur is truly limited by the sheer complexity and depth of the theories exposed.  For example, Feynman's finding that electrons travel in all different paths from one point to the other, thereby being in different places at the same time, is an absolute challenge to understanding.<br /><br />One should not expect to be thrilled and feel empowered in knolwedge as after reading for example Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, or even mathematical books such as Singh's Fermat's Enigma.  Greene is a true physicist living on the edge of the science, telling us a story about where we are in knowledge; in telling this story, it is not possible to truly explain the theories behind our knowledge, so Greene (rightfully, I believe) resorts to a method of describing history rather than science.<br /><br />The book can be divided into three sections, 1.relativity, 2.quantum physics and 3.string theory.  Up to the end of section one, Greene does a masterful job of explaining the underpinnings of relativity theory in such a simple way that one can actually understand what Einstein was up to, if only for a few moments while reading the book.  In this section I did feel like my brain was growing, as I was gaining knowledge.  In the remaining two sections, I followed the book as more of a history than physics.<br /><br />Overall, if you are used to pop science, this may be a good book on physics; I have found no other as simple in its explanation of relativity for example.  However, one should not expect to understand string theory by the end of it, not at the level one understands evolution at the end of The Selfish Gene for example.	2005-01-11

In this innovative text, he argues that it is not the traditional macroeconomic variables, or even the traditional labor (education, hours worked, work ethic) and capital inputs, but rather the productivity of each of the major industries in those countries.  Ok, so far, not an earthshattering finding.  However, most interesting is his conclusion as to what leads to high productivity; not education, not access to finance, but good old free competition.<br /><br />He shows how, in markets sheltered from competition by barriers or regulation, productivity remains low and so do the returns on capital and labor.  The studies are drawn from developed (Japan, US, Europe) and developing nations (Brazil, India, Korea) and go in depth into particular industries in order to understand the factors that drive productivity.  No book in recent publication is as insightful on the true engine that drives development.<br /><br />The author was the leading partner at McKinsey in charge of the McKinsey Global Institute, McKinsey's thinktank.  Using McKinsey resources, which are unique and unavailable to any other economist, Lewis was able to analyze conditions that could only previously be seen from afar by economists.  His training as a physicist also helped him synthesize phenomena, drawing the overarching themes behind producitivity.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, it will breathe new life into economists that may be losing hope that development is not possible in certain places due to such factors as environment or culture.  It is accessive to non-economists as well, so I hope policy-makers would have a chance to read it and follow some of its good advice.	2004-10-28

The novel is based on the true story of Galvez, who briefly gained Acre (a remote state in the western Brazilian Amazon) from Bolivia in the late 1800s.  At the time, the Amazon was bustling with the rubber trade, so the economic importance of the state, one of the main rubber producers in the country, was quite obvious.<br /><br />Galvez is a migrant from Spain who meanders through the Amazon beginning in Belem, from where he is chased, ending up in Santarem then in Manaus.  A bohemian, he is dragged into the plot to save Acre from a Bolivian-American coalition that would annex Acre to Bolivia, despite the majority of Brazilian rubber tappers living there.<br /><br />Souza uses crude and sarcastic language in order to depict the decadent and complex society living in the Amazon, with prosptitutes from Europe, Northeastern Brazilians tapping rubber, American and European magnates, scientists with strange theories about the region and overall adventurers seeking a new life (as was the case with Galvez).<br /><br />Souza pokes fun at that society as well as the military conception of the Amazon at the time the wrote the book (1970s), which drew some political trouble for him at the time.  He has since written much, of which I have only read Mad Maria so far.  His style is definitely reminiscent of Emile Zola in the crudeness of the language.  If you are getting acquainted with Souza, I would recommend Mad Maria first, since it is more of a standard novel.  In Emperor of the Amazon, he uses a different style of breaking up the chapters into little pieces, which can get distracting at times.  Overall, however, it is a very interesting book, continuing the tradition of able Latin American writers using sarcasm and an artistic touch in a almost surreal environment.	2004-10-13

The novel unfolds as the schoolteacher (Odili) enters politics as a way to avenge his poor fate with his girlfriend.<br /><br />As with any Achebe novel, we are introduced in a developing society, still in the excitement of self rule after the British, but struggling to get set on a path towards development.  Achebe is very ironic at time, and I think this novel especially shows his wry sense of humor.  For example, the Minister of Culture is a rather cultureless man, put in that position through connections and bribery.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book if you enjoyed Achebe's previous work (Things Fall Apart and No Longer at Ease are my favorites).  At only 150 pages, it is the shortest by him that I have read, which makes it even more worth it.  Would not recommend as your first Achebe.	2004-10-06

This book is, so far, the best textbook I have seen to teach econometrics.  It divides concepts into chapters that are easy to reference separately, and it follows a logical sequence similar to the one in most college-level courses.<br /><br />In its 4th edition, Gujarati has had much time to improve the method and get comments.  However, after having gone through the course and the textbook, I was left with the feeling that there must be a better way to teach econometrics.  After learning it, you realize that the concepts are indeed simple, with much complex veneer to scare people away.  In a few years, a wise and student-aware professor will write a textbook (call it the Econometrics Holy Grail?) that will make learning econometrics similar to learning basic stats.	2004-09-24

The fun part did not reach its promise, the examples did not seem to me to captivate the audience and make them truly excited about it.  To make it fun I borrowed some examples from Simon Singh's The Code Book on decyphering codes, which was much more effective at least in getting people excited.  The level that the author is presenting to is much more of a high school and below crowd than a grown-up crowd.<br /><br />As for making it easy, the author certainly makes a good effort at taking the complexity out of teaching and using examples that make it very clear what each concept means.  The probability section I think is particularly worthy of praise.  However, once you need to get into slighly more complex ideas such as binomial distributions, t-stats, etc., the book does not follow through.<br /><br />This is a good book to teach beginners without much math background the very basic stats, high school level.  If you need to go farther than that, I would suggest you stick to the textbook and look elsewhere for good ideas.	2004-09-24

The background of this novel is the destruction of a Lebanese family living in the port city of Manaus, caused by the hatred between two twin brothers (hence the title) and the missplaced love of the mother and sister.  The destruction of the family is followed by the demise of the physical house as well.  The family decays with the city, and when the city starts to revive, the family is disassembled to start a new life with the four young members (the brothers, sister, and son of the maid).<br /><br />Though the story seems to focus on the disputes of the brothers, it is actually narrated by a third person who we only get to know deep into the book, the son of the maid.  His main issue is finding out who his father is, and he gets little glimpses of it through stories told him, mainly by Halim, the father of the house, and the maid.<br /><br />The book is captivating and suspenseful.  Hatoum is a master in the art of showing how things are falling apart, as he simultaneously makes the family, the house and the city degerate.  He is a worthy member of the degeneration club, that includes Achebe, Poe and Conrad.  Highly recommended, a good short page turner.	2004-09-19

Souza emplys a style reminiscent of Emile Zola in that he appeals to naturalism to describe people's feelings and often uses metaphors of a woman's intimate parts to describe the situation fo the railroad and the main engine, Mad Maria, that is testing the railway.<br /><br />It is interesting to read the book and then visit the remaining parts of the railway.  There are many leftover bridges along the Madeira river that can be visited, and even an engine can be seen in the town of Abunã, which the townspeople say is Mad Maria.<br /><br />It is a very nice and quick read, but not for those that shy away from violence or darkness.  Reminded me a bit of Heart of Darkness, though Mad Maria is written in a much more crude, aggressive style.  I highly recommend it, espcially if you will be travelling to the Amazon, as a way to understand the difficulties development has faced in the region.	2004-09-08

He cites examples and tells stories that are clearly very familiar to locals, but not to outsiders.  Such writing makes me believe that the audience aimed is in fact Nigerians rather than outsiders.<br /><br />However, there are important lessons from outsiders, which are condensed into the less than 100 pages of this small book.  Issues such as corruption and disrespect for laws are addressed from a very different standpoint than usual economists would.  The ideas and concepts from this book are applicable to other countries facing difficulties reaching high standards of living.  I, for one, wish someone had written such a book on Brazil.  It is a quick read, worth your 2 hours.	2004-08-13

This book is not an economics textbook, since he does not spend much time on the basic concepts of economics such as price theory.  He assumes a bit of knowledge and uses it to make the case for many different economic ideas ranging from macroeconomics (monetarism) to microeconomics (school vouchers).<br /><br />For a book that was written in the 60s, it is amazing how current his ideas remain.  It is perhaps the most important book on the libertarian philosophy, focusing on preventing the accumulation of power by any individual or group of individuals in society.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great read for someone familiar with economics and social sciences, it will definitely expand your horizons of thought.  However, if you are looking for an introduction to interesting eocnomic ideas, I would suggest you read Free to Choose, which Friedman wrote a dozen years later to reach a more general audience.	2004-08-13

Becker is one fo the most brilliant economists in the 20th century, taking the tools of economic analysis to other social sciences, especially sociology.<br /><br />The articles have varied topics, including:<br /><br />- Economic analysis of marriage<br /><br />- Economic analysis of family size<br /><br />- Economic justification for altruism<br /><br />- Economic analysis of restaurant pricing patterns<br /><br />- Economic analysis of discrimination<br /><br />- Economic analysis of crime<br /><br />It is a bit academic, since these are the original article he wrote for academic journals, but they are understandable since it is mostly concepts and not too many equations (though there are some).  For the absolute beginner, this may be too advanced, so I would recommend The Economics of Life by Becker as well.  If you have some knowledge of economics, I believe this would be a great choice.  It shows how the rationality acquired in economics is applicable elsewhere, almost everywhere.	2004-08-13

Given the very limited space (18 pages), it is impossible to make a very strong argument on such a broad topic.  Friedman makes some good points, but most of them do not provide supporting evidence, so it leaves a hesitant reader unconvinced.  It seems to me that this book is sufficient for good argument over cocktail conversation.<br /><br />For a more thorough analysis of the same arguments presented in this short book, I would recommend either Capital and Freedom or Free to Choose by Friedman as well.	2004-08-13

The author focused on explaining basic concepts and their importance without getting into the details of the stats behind it.  Hence, it is a book focused on a general audience wanting to learn about the history and the characters that pushed statistics forward mainly in the 20th century (there was not much before).  It should be a very easy and interesting read for someone knowledgeable of very basic math and stats (if you know what a standard deviation is, you should be ok).<br /><br />The author, as a lifelong statistician, is clearly in awe of the characters described, such as Pearson and Fisher, which do seem to a bit influence his writing.  For example, he is descriptive of personal meetings with some of the main described characters, which leaves me thinking that, aside from a history of stats, this may also be his personal history.  Overall, this is seldom seem, and it does not much hurt the content, which is clearly very well researched and written.  If you are looking to add to your knowledge and are done with pop science, this may be an interesting next book.	2004-08-13

The topics are not really connected, so one can just move on to somehting one finds more interesting.<br /><br />Overall, I believe I now know what many of the complex topics like chaos theory are about.

It touches upon the values economists should emphasize (and often don't) and the errors made in the name of paternalism and a state that lead economic life.  It is a book to be added to the likes of The Road to Serfdom (Hayek) and Capitalism and Freedom (Friedman).  For such important and clear thinking Sen is worth the Nobel prize.<br /><br />In terms of economics, Sen makes the clear case that it is freedom and not wealth that should be maximized.  He defines a freedom as anything we have a reason to value, which is different than the usual definition and will strike many as strange, but accepting his definition is key to understanding and agreeing with the value of freedom in society.  For example, we may want growth to get development, but development can also be defined as extended life expectancy (the freedom to enjoy more years alive) or less hunger (the freedom to avoid hunger).<br /><br />I highly recommend Development as Freedom to anyone interested in development.  As someone from a developing country, Sen is particularly attuned with the realities and the policies that are able to bring freedom, and hence development, to the developing world.	2004-08-12

He does so in a variety of ways:<br />1. He demonstrates how complex physics concepts are used in literature to seem more scientific.<br />2. He shows how creationists seek legitimacy in the public eye with scientific sounding ideas like &quot;intelligent design&quot; and others which are nothing more than pseudo-science.  He also offers ideas on how to deal with them.<br />3. He points out, in an open letter to his daughter, how to know what is truth and what isn't, what are good and bad reasons to believe something.<br />4. He recommends a number of follow up readings in his book reviews.  These are mainly on Stephen Jay Gould and Peter Medawar, two other famed biologists who write for the general public.<br />The essence of the book is reflected, I believe, in the last essay, in which he makes the point that evidence is the only way to truth and knowledge, and the basis of science.  He shows that evidence is a better reason to believe something than its three foes: authority, revelation and tradition.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for intelligent arguments and thoughts on a wide variety of subjects, all related to science, its importance and its usage (or lack thereof) in society.	2004-07-02

It goes through the usual details of the expedition, with all the preparations and the thrill of reaching the summit after a tremendous effort, until, on the way down, Joe Simpson, the author, falls and breaks his knee.  Simon, his partner, tries to lower him down the mountain, but reaches a point in which he can no longer hold Joe's weight and so he cuts the rope, letting Joe fall into a crevasse.  And here the real drama begins..<br />This is an intensely personal story, in which there is a strongly psychological aspect, both to Joe, trying to survive after falling into the crevasse, and to Simon, going over the guilt of having cut the rope.  Joe's ordeal is amazing, with a broken leg and left for dead; he makes it through miles of glaciers and rocks to make it back to camp.<br />Overall, it is a very well told story.  My only comment is that the ending is a bit longer than it should be.  The authors gets the reader very animated about his prospects of survival, then starts some long winded descriptions of a lake or of rock; i just had to skip a couple of the paragraphs to get to the punchline.  I highly recommend it to someone who likes mountaineering or survival stories, this is one of the really good ones.	2004-05-11

Achebe does a masterful job of depicting the experience of an ex-patriate returning home after many years abroad.  Such experience is universal, not confined to Nigeria or the main character Obi Okonkwo (grandson of the main character in Things Fall Apart).<br />In adition to the ex-pat experience, Achebe inserts the peculiarly Nigerian experience, in which a group of British still retained some of the leadership positions in civil service while native Nigerians were mostly focused on politics.  The moral aspect is also noteworthy, as the widely accepted corruption and favouring done by Nigerians in power was not mirrored by the British.<br />Aside from the socio-historical aspect of the novel, Achebe is very sensitive in showing the downward spiral of young Obi, as he tries to fight against strong unreasonable traditions (such as with his girlfriend who is of a banished caste).  Obi gets enmeshed in a vicious cycle in which he needs to show success, to a point in which his salary can longer sustain his lifestyle, which is forced upon him by expectations.<br />I highly recommend this book, especially to ex-pats of any nation.  As an ex-pat returned home myself, I feel many of the same difficulties Obi did.  Obi's anguish and pain are crystal clear, and any ex-pat will relate.	2004-05-10

In it, Dawkins provides clear explanations of the mechanism of evolution, to the point that the reader can teach someone about evolution right after reading.  It does not in any way patronize the reader, but instead delves deep into complex subjects, ranging from game theory to psychology, to explain evolution.<br />The main idea in the book is to change the perspective of evolution: it is genes that use bodies and organisms to reach their goals of reproduction.  In my opinion, however, the most brilliant part of the book is the very beginning, in which Dawkins explains how it could come about that some chemicals (genes) actually would grow a \\"wish\\" to reproduce.  The answer makes the reader feel really smart, and that is what pop science is all about.<br />Much of the book is devoted to showing how evolution can in fact explain altruism, agression, aging, cooperation, sexual relations, etc.  He spends a lot of time debunking the theory that animals act a certain way \\"for the good of the species\\".  His argument is that animals have no want, it is the genes that want more of themselves available.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with a wide open mind, a logical train of thought, and deep curiosity about life.  Dawkins will change the way you see life, and he will hold your hand through the entire process, quenching your thrist for knowledge.  It is written in such a simple way that it is hard to understand why this book is not recommended at high schools.  Anyways, I hope you choose this book, it is one of those that make you sad to have finished.	2004-05-10

He then proceeds to introduce the beginning of colonialism, which disrupts the fine balance that had been achieved previously.  Such story is told through the life of Okonkwo.<br />Okonkwo is depicted as a violent man with a strong temper.  However, the readers can help sympathizing with him as we follow his life's story and his deep fear of failure, which he gained from seeing his father fail his entire life.  Okonkwo became a strong leader in his tribe Umuofia (in Ibo, Nigeria).  His fear of failure and weakness extend to his son, who he considers similar to his father.  He begins his undoing when, afraid to seem weak, he is forced to slaughter a boy that lived in his house, Ikemefuna.  He then proceeds, through bad luck, to be banned from the tribe.  As he is returning 7 years later and looking forward to his old life, colonial life appears.<br />The changes that occur between old and new, especially those related to religion, lead to his downfall.  Through his downfall, Achebe represents the downfall of an entire society.  It is a deeply moving work, one that will leave you wanting to read more of Achebe's books.  I recommend following the series with No Longer at Ease next, it is very interesting as well.	2004-04-08

The anecdotes are outstanding, especially the ones on large numbers and on probability.  For example, he shows how one is fooled by probability: If we have 23 people in a room, what is the probability that two of them have the same birthday? 50%!!  Very conterintuitive.<br />The author also tries to understand why it is almost considered acceptable for a person to admit that one is &quot;bad with numbers&quot;, while it not being ok to be &quot;bad with words&quot;.  The realm of psychology is not his forte, but the ideas he points to are interesting.<br />Overall, this is an easy to read book, much easier even to one literate with numbers.  I was done with it in 3 hours, and was left wanting more, so much so that I am now buying some more of his works.  If they are half as good as Innumeracy, then they will be good enough.	2004-04-03

In this book, Rubin maintains his posture as a man of few, carefully chosen words, which helps us understand the reasons for his success.<br />In its structure, this is a typical biography, tracking his childhood influences and his early years as a student at Harvard and Yale, then his career at Goldman.  His success at Goldman is clearly understated, since he nowhere mentions being very sucessful at anything he did.  Then he explains his entrance into government through fundraising, giving interesting advice to those interested in joining politics.  However, the most interesting portion of the book, from my standpoint of international economics, is his work during the economics crises from 1995 to 1999.<br />Rubin explains in great detail the policy choices made at the time and the diplomacy going on behind the rescue plans for Korea, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia.  For anyone who followed the markets during that period, this book provides new insights into the real workings of politicians and economists in trying to avert a global meltdown.<br />Rubin also provides two interesting analyses: first, his method of making decisions, through probabilistic analysis.  Though obvious, most people clearly do not understand or follow it, so it is important to outline its characteristics, which Rubin does well.  His main point is that a decision can be the right one even if it leads to failure.  The second analysis is one of the current economic condition and the direction in which the country is going.  Rubin is critical of the recent tax cuts and raises worries about the future of the US eocnomy based on the large deficits being accumulated and the future prognostics for social security.<br />Overall, it is an outstanding work, one that gives insights and teaches one about history and how to think.  I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in politics or economics, but especially anyone interested in international economics and globalization.olitics or economics, but especially anyone interested in international economics and globalization.	2004-02-26

Also, this is not a book to read quickly; it takes a lot of reflection to try to grasp the meaning (and often times you don't) of the wonderous stories.<br />Having said that, this is a wonderful book.  Garcia Marquez tells the story of a family and a town, Macondo.  The things that happen there are surreal; strange murders, sleeping disorders, scientists, soldiers, all revolve around the mansion of the Buendia family in Macondo.  The tales introduce the reader to 20th century Latin American literature, with tales of love, sadness, desperation, hurt, and loss.<br />This is Garcia Marquez's most famous work, and arguably his best.  It is a book to be savored slowly, page by page, contemplated and reflected upon.  If you are looking for a page turner or light reading, feel free to skip this book.  It is made for a very specific type of reader, one that will take the time to decypher the meaning of the stories and uncover the artistic content hidden just below the surface of the page.	2004-01-26

It does a thorough job of describing the natural environment and the differences between sub-regions.<br />Unfortunately, the entire Amazon is altogether too large and too diverse for a single volume such as this one, but I believe that it does reasonably well at condensing some of the main aspects and choosing specific themes to focus on.  For example, the book focuses on the geology of the reason, explaining the differences in river color by showing the different origins of the rivers (there are yellow, black, green, and transparent waters).  Additionally, the book singled out the lifecyle of local catfish, that crisscross the region by their feeding and breeding habits.<br />One of the outstanding qualities of this book is the images, which try to do justice to the beauty of the region.  Through the pictures, one can tell the deep differences between the sub-regions; some are mountainous, some are planes, some are swamps, in some places the forest is denser, etc.<br />If you are planning a visit to the Amazon, or have a strong interest in the Amazonian ecosystem, this may be the best book available today.

This is a book aimed at the layperson who has some interest in mathematics and linguistics.  He mixes the science behind codes and cyphers with a stronhg dose of history, which puts the amazing achievements in this science in the context of changing human history.<br />The history in the book ranges from Roman codes through the middle ages and finally arriving to the 2nd world war and the Enigma machine.  Not only is the history told in great detail, but also with some attention the reader understands exactly the process that was taken to arrive at the cyphers and their breaking.  An addition portion of history told is that of the decyphering of hieroglyphics and Linear B, ancient forms of writing on which some of the tools of cryptology (especially mathematics and linguistics) were used.<br />Simon Singh uses a formula similar to the one he uses in Fermat's Enigma (another outstanding book for amateur mathematicians): he tells a story on a subject that is tremendously complex, but makes it simple enough so that someone who is dedicated to understanding it can at least grasp the main concepts.<br />This is a great book for amateur mathematicians, statisticians and linguists.  It is also a great portion of our history that is seldom heard of.  I highly recommend it as one of the best page turners I have read in a while.	2004-01-19

How Leaders Build Lasting Relationships	Books	4	4	4	N	N	THE HIDDEN BENEFITS OF LOYALTY	Reichfeld's thesis is that loyalty, more than a fosuc on profits, is what guarantees companies long term success.  He uses a handful of examples, including Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Northwestern Mutual, Harley Davidson, Cisco, among others, to make the case that having outstanding loyalty from your customers, suppliers and employees drives outstanding results.<br />The main rules Reichfeld sticks to and calls the &quot;high road&quot; are the following:<br />1. Focus on win/win solutions with partners<br />2. Focus only on clients which you can serve well<br />3. Focus on simplicity to allow everyone to understand the rules<br />4. Develop a set of principles and live by them, rewarding others who act according to those principles.<br />Overall, he makes a strong case to show how these principles can have a positive effect on business.  By having low turnover, a fast food restaurant spends very little on HR expenses.  By focusing on the bikes their customers love (and not diversifying), Harley gains lifelong customers.<br />The weakenesses of the book lie in the overemphasis of loyalty, in relation to other important tasks in business.  Of course, being a book on loyalty, one could not expect anything different.  Additionally, it would have eben useful to have some fake types of loyalty as example of weak attempts at loyalty.  I am sure certain companies must have tried to gain loyalty through not-so-smart measures, so it would be nice to haev examples in order to differentiate them.<br />Overall, it is a very interesting book, useful to anyone involved in customer related businesses and in managing employee relationships.  It is short (a benefit) and a bit too concise (a drawback), so it should not take more than a week to read for a regular reader.	2004-01-13

Reading this book is a life changing experience for anyone who has not had much exposure to economics; Dr Friedman, alas, is arguably the top economist of our time.<br />The book offers not only a critique of developments in education, trade policy, workers rights, drug policy, among other economic and social issues, but he also offers solutions.  He readily recognizes the difficulties of implementing his solutions (political mainly), but nonetheless he is searching for the best non-utopian alternative.<br />Dr Friedman will also demystify the image that economists are wholly consumed by growth and GDP.  He is guided by the rule that each person knows best what they want and should be free to pursue it, within limits (of hurting others, etc.).<br />This is an easy to read book, a great intro to social issues or a great alternative view of the world.  I hardly think it can be construed as liberal or conservative, these labels cannot encompass the true spirit of freedom as developed in the book.  If I had to classify it, this book is about the rational improvement of society by letting each one pursue their own goals (again, a maxim espoused by the founding fathers and long forgotten).  Overall, anyone interested in social issues should read this book; it may not convince you, but it will make you think.	2003-12-07

The great merit of this book is that it does not preach to the reader the latest management fad, but rather goes through a thorough analysis of budgeting processes, highlighting benefits and drawbacks of each.  They do not claim ABC is the best approach, and even praise some simpler methods that are more adequate for certain companies.  Instead, they point to the circumstances in which ABC can provide outstanding results to companies.<br />The book structured first with an analysis of the most often used systems of managerial cost accounting.  It highlights the shortcomings of these, proceeding then to present certain productivity improvements that could contribute to performance.  These are mostly related to the quality movements (TQM, 6 Sigma, etc), which are presented in a very understandable way.  These are complements to the existing usual cost management systems.  These improvements can be made even without implementing ABC systems.<br />Then the authors proceed to describe activity based costing and its benefits in terms of choosing customers, suppliers, and product breadth.  They present many examples that would be very relevant to any practitioner, in industry or service.  There is a specific section focusing on services, which makes the appropriate adaptations to the systems for the peculiarities of it.<br />Overall, an outstanding work, to help anyone involved in cost management, whether they are interested in activity based costing or more traditional standard costing methods.	2003-11-23

The innovative nature of the work lies in putting together all the methods of social analysis available at his time and providing a comprehensive view of the nature of suicide in society.<br />Mixing quantitative and qualitative methods, Durkheim provides the basis for the future development of sociology.  He brings science to the study of society, by developing a hypothesis, gathering data and testing the hypothesis.  He proves the powerful influence of society on the behavior of individuals, which, though obvious today, was not a clear conclusion at the time.<br />This is a basic reading for anyone interested in sociology.  However, anyone interested in the application of scientific methods to society and other non-traditional fields for science would also find it very useful.	2003-11-15

The author uses the realtionship between a wise mentor and an eager mentee to take the reader through the process of understanding the different models.  The book is aimed at describing and giving the reader some insight into each model; it is not an in depth analysis of profitability.  Given its aim, it is well written.<br />It is not a step by step process to apply at a business.  This is a book to make a manager reflect, not follow.  Each chapter is one story that describes a model; the style seems to follow the general outline of Harvard Business School cases, which, given the author's professorship there, is not so surprising.<br />I highly recommend it to someone looking for an entertaining read that will make one reflect.  However, disregard the recommendation that you go through one chapter per week.  It is too little, I think I would probably lose the book by the 3rd week.  It is, instead, a book to be read in 3 days, and be referred back for ideas.	2003-11-06

The story is simplistic, with shallow characters.  However, if we keep in mind that this was meant to be a very short book to simply show us what &quot;change&quot; could be like, then I think the book achieves what it set out to do.<br />Of course, in such a short book, not many issues could be addressed.  The book uses the mice and men metaphor to have reader draw his own conclusions.  I saw a lot fo criticism of this book, but I think this criticism might be coming from someone more used to an academic approach to a topic.  This book is very good to present to someone who is not very sophisticated and who is in need of recognizing the need for change, not for the MBA at McKinsey.	2003-11-03

It is clear that the amount of research involved is extraordinary, and the authors do a good job of transmitting to the reader the deep feelings and history involved.<br />One major comment is that the whole sotry is mainly focused on WWII, making the title &quot;WINE AND WAR&quot; somewhat misleading.  As a piece of history, this is not very additive to the history of WWII.  The French Resistance has its history well documented, and this is only a portion of its activities.  There is some lack of connection between the individual stories and the actual political and military developments of the war, making the stories interesting but disconnected.<br />Overall, this is a great book if you are a wine enthusiast or if you want somehting to read over a 10 hour flight, but if you are a pure historian, look elsewhere.	2003-10-28

As a soccer fan, I can see a glimpse of myself in the pages, though I am not as radical as the author ever was.<br />There is much insight into the feelings of soccer fans and their way of thinking.  Particularly interesting and true is the feeling that only those that follow the team through the bad times should be allowed to cheer in the good times.  Very true in myself included, I am afraid.<br />However, given the deep focus on soccer, there is not much there for the non soccer fan.  Even being a soccer fan, one needs to be quite familiar with English teams and the championships they play in order to fully follow the author.  The book have benefitted from an explanatory appendix, but then again, true fans wouldn't need and might find it offensive if there were one.	2003-07-19

The work presented in this volume is largely responsible for the authors being awarded the Nobel Prize (Tversky died before receiving it).<br />The text is somewhat dense at parts, being aimed at economists and psychologists with some mathematical familiarity.  However, the portions of the book that require much mathematics can safely be bypassed without losing much of the substance of the text.  This text is the most credible presentation of an alternative theory to the rational actor theory usually assumed in economics.  For example, some of the articles help explain the magnitude of the equity return premium, or help show how people make choices differently in similar situations based simply on the way the situation is presented.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in decision making theory, especially as it relates to consumer behavior.  It is a brilliant volume that includes the most important articles by the leading mind in the field.	2003-07-15

He reviews the history of risk management, with demonstrations of how far it has come and how certain successes were achieved mainly through psychological framing.  He then expands these concepts to areas to be tackled in the future, such as home equity insurance, GDP insurance, and livelihood insurance.<br />My main criticism of the book is the title, which seems overly ambitious.  In my opinion, it should have been somehitng like Future Advances in Risk Management, but then again sensationalism does help sell books.  Some of the criticism I found of the book is that it is overly simplistic.  Like many outstanding ideas, after they are known they seem simple, but it is by no means easy to come up with them.  Risk management is an area that requires a lot of development, and insurance/finance professionals are sure to gain much from the ideas in this book.  If the particular ideas in the book don't match one's area, I believe it is still an important read as a source of ideas and a way of thinking that can be applied I believe in many different areas.	2003-07-08

If you are looking for one, look elsewhere; Hillary climbed Everest, but did not have any major mountaineering accomplishments thereafter.  Instead, we see the picture of a simple man, a very likeable and sincere one, with flaws and virtues.<br />We can see his sneakiness in going for the south pole despite orders not to, we can see his dedication to the people of Nepal, we can see his somewhat estranged relationship with Tenzing and the tensions that arose after Tenzing said he had reached the summit first.  The discussion is a futile one, but it seems to put a damper on the relationship.<br />In this book we also follow his life, not just his great conquests.  We see the backstage of the lecture circuit he went through after Everest, then the honors he received and his attempt to maintain some normalcy in his life.  Overall, it is a very good life book, and despite it being filled with adventures, we see the character of a person that is much more than simply an adventurer.	2003-07-08

It is an outstanding story of suicides and lives saved, brilliance and persistence.  This is also good history, as in only a few pages one becomes literate in the evolution of mathematics from Greece to Alexandria to renaissance.<br />For the wannabe mathematician, this is an exciting book.  Though the actula mathematics involved in solving the problem are clearly beyond reach for almost everyone, it does not hamper a reader from understanding the basics, as the author offers many examples of how a proof is done and has appendix on a couple of relatively easy examples (such as the proof for Pithagoras' formula).  I highly recommend it as a quick read.  Personally, I am definitely going to read more about mathematics, a topic that previously seemed too dry.	2003-05-18

Grisham books are known for the great endings, and this one was surprisingly missing.<br />The testament is a story of a billionaire that dies and his family fights for the inheritance, which he decided to leave to an obscure woman who is doing missionary work with Indians in Brazil.  The story is one of character, as we see this missionary resist the inheritance while the family is fighting legal battles in the U.S. to get the money.<br />What I liked the most was the overall scenery of the Brazilian pantanal, a large swampland in midwestern Brazil.  The imagery of forest and the adventure aspect of it what new, as I had not seen Grisham engage in adventure type writing (he does it well nonetheless).<br />Overall, I recommend this book, though I would first read The Partner, which I thought was substantially better.	2003-05-03

In it, she chronicles the life of a family, as the patriarch grows from a child to an elder, with the world changing all around him while he tries to keep it the same.  Through the lenses of the Trueba family, we follow the portion of Chilean history that eventually leads to the 1973 coup.  Of course, the author is niece of Salvador Allende, the socialist president democratically elected that was removed from power and killed by Pinochet.<br />The book is based on clashes; old versus young, communists vs conservatives, landlords vs tenants.  As the story unfolds, we view the extremist positions that each side takes: landlords attacking tenants, conservatives attacking communists, and vice versa.  From the polarization of positions emerges a military dictatorship that no one wanted, but that was a product of the system setup by polarization.<br />In the end, the distinctions that originally separated young from old, conservatives from communists, are removed, as both sides realize the futility of their disputes in the face on an authoritarian regime.	2003-05-03

The compilation includes articles by a large number of premier authors on the subject, including the editors, Michael Porter, David Landes, Jeffrey Sachs, Francis Fukuyama, among others.<br />The articles deal with many different topics, though the common theme is how culture affect the success of a certain aspect of society, such as health, education, institutions, justice, etc.  It does focus on blaming certain cultures for lack of success, but rather it tries to understand the themes that allow certain cultures to outperform others.  The lessons do not blame a culture, but rather suggests somewhat modest (and often drastic) change that is necessary to permit a well functioning capitalist economy to exist.<br />As an economist, I found this book extremely useful in demonstrating the &quot;transaction costs&quot; that a culture may impose on a country, hence reducing its opporutnities for growth.  In economics, this is usually studied in theory, but this book provides lively examples of how this is truly the case.  However, I do believe that this book would be useful for practitioners in other disciplines.	2003-05-03

This book is mainly about the theory itself and its origins and features, not about applications in particular, though the author does address that issue at the end of the book in the section about eocnomic performance.<br />I believe this book is great reading for the literate economist.  It is difficult to follow for the non-economist, which I believe North focuses on in his other book, &quot;Structure and Change in Economic History&quot;.  That work is earlier and I believe not as complete, but it is much more readable.  Either way, North's work is among the most important advances in economics in the 20th century (for which he got the Nobel Prize), so knowledge of it should benefit one and all.	2003-04-26

I found the first section, when Senge focuses on an explanation for systems thinking, was outstanding, and all the stars I give this book are based on the first 100 pages.<br />The rest of the book, when Senge seeks to develop the other four disciplines, seemed to me very unfocused and not as useful as the first part.  The ending wraps it all together, in a pretty good summary of his entire argument.<br />If I were to start reading this book today, I would read the portion on systems thinking, skim the section on the other four disciplines, and read the ending.  I believe that would be much more time efficient, not to mention interesting.  Make sure, though, that you understand the basics of the other four disciplines in order to proceed to the ending.<br />Overall, it was an interesting read, useful for the systems thinking perspective, especially for a beginner in the subject.

In this process, we learn of the political ploys adopted by the PRI, the almost monarchic party that led the country for most of the century.  These include forays into education, health, and the most important social services.  Another important area is the corruption going on at the top levels of the PRI, requiring, for example, that business people contribute a minimum of [several] million to participate in the government, or else be excluded, with all that it entailed.  There is less than I would like to know on Carlos Salinas, the now disgraced but formerly darling leader.<br />Overall, a good history and a well written book.

The situations outlined are very diverse, including a mountainclimbing expedition, a pharmaceutical company's decision, a firefighter's dillemma, and a Central American emerging democracy's negotiation with terrorism, to name a few.  Roughly half of the stories are cases of success, half are failures, which makes it interesting exploration of both sides of the coin.<br />Overall, the stories are very interesting per se, and worth the read.  Some of these are classics of management and ethics, such as the Merck Riverblindness case.  At the end of each story, Useem tries to do an analysis of what the leader did right or wrong.  In this section, I did in fact disagree with some of Useem's conclusions, and what bothered me was the fact that I felt like the author did not leave enough space for alternative views.  For example, he argues that Roy Vagelos of Merck was a great leader because he guided his company to do the right thing and spend all the money on the disease though it would not recoup costs.  I would argue that he did recoup, by the free publicity, which Useem helps extend, but Useem never mentions the possibility of it being worth it.<br />I did like the book and would recommend it, especially the stories, which are told in a very fast paced and easy to read manner.  However, not so sure about the analysis.	2003-04-12

Given its age (it was originally written in the 1960s), it does not include much of the later scholarship on the subject.<br />However, it is a great introduction to collective action, as the basic argument has not changed: groups in which the benefits from collective goods cannot be denied to people are very difficult to organize.  Organization will more lilkey come about when there is one (or a small number of) individual whose cost of action is lower than his own expected benefits; this leads to an exploitation by the small of the large, which is an interesting and counterintutive situation.<br />Olson provides a wide array of examples, which are of course old but nonetheless relevant.  Examples include farming organizations, trade unions, business pressure groups, medical associations, etc.  Overall, I found this book to be very interesting and easy to read, as the economics hardly ever go beyond basic math.  For people who like rational arguments, it will be a pleasure to read this.  The most interesting portion of the book, in my opinion, is the author's argument why Marxism does not work in practice in the way that Marx predicted.	2003-04-08

It is long winded and it has no major plot twists.  The story is based on Cayall, a member of the KKK that bombs the office of a Jewish lawyer.  He is put on death row and his grandson, who is a lawyer, takes the case and tries to run with it.<br />On the positive side, there is plenty of character development and the ambiguity of good and evil is clear in most of the characters.  The story is well described, to the point that the reader really gets involved in the feelings of the characters.  However, the book just ends without any major occurrences that would make the reader skip a beat, as usual Grisham thrillers do.  Another positive is the overall debate over the death penalty.<br />Overall, this is a decent book, not a Grisham.	2003-04-08

As such, they argue that model innovation is more productive, from the perspective of upper management, than focusing on improve the operational efficiency of the existing model.<br />The most striking feature of this book is the sheer number of examples used.  I don't think one could find a business strategy book with more examples; given the often fuzzy nature of strategy books, this is a welcomed change.<br />I see the book as structured into two parts: first, the authors present what business model innovation is and present a million examples; second, the authors make the case for how an organization can be designed to be flexible enough to adapt to this type of innovation, and ultimately to develop the innovation itself.<br />I have finished the book a strong believer in the benefits of business model innovation.  I especially enjoyed the summaries at the end that help the reader apply the concepts to their own cases.  As a practitioner, I look forward to trying to apply the ideas in the book in practice.	2003-04-06

The premise of the book is a partner in a law firm that steals 90 million and runs away to Brazil (my home country).  The book starts by him being captured (so no secrets give away here) and evolves through a brilliant set of plot twists that lead up to a surprising and heartbreaking ending.<br />This is the type of book to pick up one day and finsih the next; make sure you have time to read it straight, because it will be hard to put it down once you start, and it will definitely leave an emptiness after you finish.  This is the best international theft thriller I have ever read.	2003-04-06

In it, he shows in detail the techniques he employed in putting together much of his activism, which ended up being called the Alinsky doctrine later on.<br />Overall, I thought this book was great to impassion a reader new to the subject, yet as a guidebook for a new &quot;radical&quot;, I thought his later (and less impassioned, though more passionate than 99% of other books) &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; was much more clear minded.  As he writes in the later book, much of Reveille was written during his time in prison, which shows.<br />Personally, I recommend reading Rules first, and then proceeding to Reveille.  The reader will benefit from his clear minded analysis in Rules, to then better understand his arguments and passion in Reveille.	2003-04-06

It takes place at Salomon Brothers, the famed former investment bank (now part of Citigroup) that had a reputation for a brash culture and greed.  Michael is a new member of the sales and trading desk in the 1980s, a time when Salomon dominated the bond markets and pioneered the mortgage backed securities market.<br />In an often cynical but always humorous style, the author describes the internal dynamics of Salomon, where testosterone filled the trading floor and greed was placed above everything.  Since the book was published, Salomon got in a lot of trouble for illegal actions in the government securtities market, involving Gutfreund (in the book) and Meriwether (of When Genius Failed fame).  In was actually interesting to meet one of the characters, Mike Mortara, who was at the time head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs.<br />Overall this is a funny little entertaining book, and a must if you are going to work on Wall Street, since people assume you are familiar with it and may even quote from it.	2003-03-28

It is clear that the author did a thorough reseach on the occurences and the attitudes of Germans while the holocaust was taking place, and from that we can see that there was a significant latent anti-semitism waiting to come out.<br />On the negative side, I thought the book left much to be desired from the perspective of psychology.  After reading Cialdini's \\"Influence\\", it is clear to me that there were many issues involving social proof that pervaded German's attitudes and actions at the time.  From the historical perspective, the author is right on with a well researched book; from the psych perspective, however, it is unclear that the author achieves what he set out to do: that Germans were not \\"under the influence\\" while committing their crimes.	2003-03-28

It is difficult to give good examples that don't sound corny here, but trust me that the author puts these references in a way that the reader gets a complete image of the situation.<br />The war is seen away from its political or military environment, but rather from the perspective of daily deaths, without much meaning or crying.  There is some gore, but it is done well, to the point that it will make the reader finch and understand the conditions.<br />In this meaningless world of war, the ending is fitting.  The telegraph on conditions of war in Germany reads \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", on a day when Paul Baumer dies.  The book is a powerful statement, with no need to scream.	2003-03-28

In the articles, which are mainly written by a limited number of professors, all important topics related to entrepreneurship are addressed, such as finance, personality, marketing, strategy, culture, and many more.  From an academic perspective, it is a 10.<br />However, I often felt that it was missing more on the practical side.  For example, there are a few case studies, but only on certain topics.  It was missing more of the &quot;been there, done that&quot; perspective.  Definitely there were stories, but in those there was more of a strategic analysis rather than visionary or inspirational.<br />Overall, this is a very good book to use as reference to certain topics, especially in an academic environment.	2003-03-28

From this book, we are able to see that he is a man of vision and strong will, both of which he uses to lead GE in a period of great growth.<br />I was a little disappointed by the lack of detail on many sections, such as Six Sigma and other GE management innovations, which I expected to find in this book.  I found it to be much more of a history than an analysis text, which is okay for readability (hence the 4 stars), but does not help much in drawing interesting lessons.<br />Given this man's significance to the stock market exuberance and the star CEO mania of the 1990s, I think it is an important book to help one understand the time.  The concise style is also a plus.	2003-03-26

However, since then, I have read both Shell's &quot;Bargaining for Advantage&quot; and Cialdini's &quot;Influence&quot;, and found those two books immensely better than Getting to Yes, for a few different reasons.<br />Number of stories - in Getting to Yes, the authors do not offer enough stories to burn the concepts into the reader's mind.  I personally think stories are the best way to communicate something like negotiating.<br />Actual psychological concepts explained - Getting to Yes is a summary of findings, and it never explains why certain things work.  Without a deep understanding, it is not clear when the concepts work and when they don't.  Especially in Influence, you really get to understand how to persuade someone by remembering the core psych concepts.<br />If you are just looking for a quick intro to negotiating, this is a decent book.  If you would like to actually understand people and how to influence them, this is too basic.	2003-03-24

Following Orwell's tradition (from 1984), the novel is set in Berlin under a police state.  1984 was of course a great novel, but this is a much more realistic image of what might have been.<br />The main character is a police detective who is divorced with a son that dislikes him for not being a super-Nazi supporter.  It is Hitler's 75th birthday, and so celebrations abound, when there are a few murders of high commanders in the government.<br />Given the positive image of naziism in this imagined world, the main character follows a trail that is filled with danger in order to a great secret, which I will not mention in order not to ruin it for future readers.<br />It is a good fast read, and I especially appreciated the entire mind construction of what a post-war Germany under Hitler might look like.  The lessons are secondary and not the most interesting part of the book.	2003-03-24

It is the type of novel that once into it, the reader simply cannot put down, especially after the team lands in England.<br />The premise of the story is a group of Germans that have a mission to kidnap Churchill.  The leader, Kurt Steiner, a paratrooper, is a very compelling character, which makes th readers simpathize with him.  On the other side is Liam Devlin, a former IRA fighter, helping the team in England.<br />The story unfolds seamlessly, with the German team recruiting help in England of nazi simpathizers, then moving in and planning the kidnap at Churchill's country estate.<br />As they are almost ready for the kidnapping, two children almost drown and one of the Germans tries to help them, blowing his cover.  Then I should say no more, as the story becomes a thriller that the reader just cannot put down.

Mallory is basically a legend in mountaineering.<br />The authors tell the story of their own search expedition by making it parallel to Mallory's.  For example, we see the logistics it took this expedition in 1999 to get everyhitng to Everest base camp.  In contrast, we see the long trek the expedition in the 1930s had to face, with sickness and much more difficult terrain and logistics.  It was amazing that they had the energy to climb once they got to base camp.<br />The book switches between a technical archeology mystery and the history known of the expedition.  It is very interesting to see the 1999 expedition trace back the steps of the earlier one.  We see the tremendous difficulties they went through in the 1930s, with clothing that was hardly appropriate and the best equipment at the time.<br />Ultimately, the authors find Mallory's body, but it is still not clear if he reached the summit before falling.  He fell and broke a knee, which is a death sentence at that altitude.  Irvine was not found.  The book ends with the authors making their own summit bid, and only two of them making it.<br />This is one of the best mountaineering books, especially as it brings in the mystery of what happened.  I highly recommend it for the armchair mountaineer.	2003-03-22

The foundation of the theory is extremely well built, making it for a coherent and well thought out book.  The main parts include:<br />1) Agriculture - the author explains how agriculture evolved first in the Fertile Crescent (today's Middle East) and expanded to the rest of the world.  He makes a good case for why it developed only much later in the Americas and Africa, and never in Australia.<br />2) Herding - another interesting point, as the author demonstrates why animal herding grew in Eurasia but not in the Americas or Africa.<br />3) Connection to political structure - the author proceeds to make the connection between agriculture and political structure, with plenty of empirical evidence.  It is pretty amazing to see how archeologists take the smallest clues to come up with interesting theories.<br />4) Political structure to germs and technology - that connection is, in my opinion, the most interesting one.  The author is not the one to come up with this theory, but he is the one who put it all together for the layman.  He shows how smallpox evolved from animals to men, and why it happened in Eurasia rather than anywhere else.<br />5) Germs and technology to domination - finally, he connects the dots that lead from having germs and technology to dominating other peoples.<br />I am truly impressed by the rationality of the argument.  The only flaw I noticed is that the author is clearly biased in thinking that the environment was the sole major cause of everything.  Though politically correct to blame the environment, there may be other causes, such as culture, that play a significant role in the fates of societies.  For example, Larry Harrison makes this case in \\"Culture Matters\\".<br />Overall, very impressive work of scholarship, deserves all the prizes it has gotten, and I will definitely incorporate these theories into my way of thinking.  This book is a 10.t has gotten, and I will definitely incorporate these theories into my way of thinking.  This book is a 10.	2003-03-21

The book does assume some prior knowledge of concepts and terminology, as it seeks to address many of the main contemporary issues related to development.  There is a definite bias of focus on Third World developing countries rather than transitional or developed countries.<br />The issues addressed include the more traditional ones (such as poverty reduction, trade policy, population issues, financing issues) coupled with some newer areas of debate (such as the specific role of women in development).  Most interesting I found the section on industrial and technological progress, which follows from the classical eocnomics argument that there should be no indsutrial policy.  As it is a compilation of arguments, it does not go terribly in depth in any of the subjects, but offers enough references for those who wish to do so.<br />For the introductory student of development, this is an essential compilation.  For the more advanced student, this is great reference and the bibliography is a list of important works.	2003-03-19

It makes for a very entertaining read, as the author not only describes the socio-political situation of the country, he also tells a story of his own experiences in the particular places.<br />When I started reading about his experiences, I often thought them exaggerated.  However, given Robert Pelton's recent abduction in the Panama Colombia border by paramilitary groups, I start to believe more and more that he actually did live through such experiences.

Instead, the authors offer the following seven factors as the main ones in determining whether firms became leaders in their markets:<br />* Envisioning the Mass Market - Examples include P&G with Pampers disposable diapers for everyone instead of for travelers only and Kodak with photographs for the non-professional.<br />* Uniqueness of Vision - Examples include Tim Berners-Lee and the development of the WorldWideWeb and King Gillette's view of the razor market.<br />* Persisting Against All Odds - Examples include Bill Gates' persistence that landed him the operating system contract with IBM and Haloid's persistence over a decade that created Xerox.<br />* The Need for Relentless Innovation - Examples include Moore and Noyce leaving Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel and the relentless pace of innovation there, and Gillette's close brush for lack of innovation in the 1960s and its ensuing fast pace since.<br />* Organizing for Innovation - Examples include HP's organization beating Xerox and IBM at the laser printer market, and Netscape beating Mosaic by taking talent and rewarding it.<br />* Raising and Committing Financial Resources - Examples include Fred Smith's almost bankruptcy to keep FedEx alive and Amazon sacrificing profits for a long period in order to achieve its envisioned mass market level of service.<br />* Leveraging Assets Despite Uncertainty - Examples include IBM losing the PC battle because it did not want to hurt its mainframe sales, and Charles Schwab's leadership in web trading after it chose to focus on it and sacrifice off line higher margins.<br />Overall, I found it a very good entertaining book, with anecdotes that help support the ideas the authors suggest.

It was a very good intorduction to the country and its people; we see the deep clash better the Kabul population, which is more \\"civilized\\" according to Western standards than the countryside, where the mullahs dominate.  These happen to be the same mullahs that we get to see on CNN.<br />The story itself is told from the perspective of a westerner, so the striking nature of the local culture is highlighted.  The mystical nature of caravans and local customs is dissected, which I found very interesting.  Also there were many references to the country's history, enough to wet the appetite about reading further on Afghanistan, but not enough to make one knowledgeable about it.<br />Overall, it is clear this is an early Michener, and the author is evolving into the national novel model he adopts later on.	2003-03-18

First, there are the two traditional aspects present in all Michener novels, history and romance, intertwined to give the reader first hand knowledge of what history felt like to the people enacting it and the bystanders.<br />In Hawaii, Michener continues this tradition by creating some of his most memorable characters and driving the reader to understand them and their interactions with each other.  I believe the anthropological aspect of this novel makes it superior to other Michener novels that focus simply on history and romance.  We see vividly the interactions between missionaries brought to convert the natives and the Hawaiian people; it is often humorous, sarcastic, and even sad.<br />Overall, Michener readers will enjoy this one as a quintessential Michener book.  Non readers, or new inductees, may also enjoy the anthropological side of this book, as it not only explores the history of the people, but analyzes in depth the changes that face them until modern days.	2003-03-18

First, as economic history, and second as economic and political analysis.<br />In the portion about economic history, Treuherz does a very good job of pointing out the relevant factors that drove each of the crises he talks about.  I found it especially useful since, though there is much information on all the 1990s crises, it is not put together in a coherent and orderly manner.  As a history of latest emerging markets crises, this book is the best I have seen.  There are other good ones about the 1980s debt crises, but this is the best for the 1990s.<br />As for the economics analysis part of the book, it is filled with comparative information, which I found very useful in helping build a framework that identifies the precursors of crises.  He discusses many economic ideas, such as free trade and the benefits of globalization, providing empirical information to back his conclusions.  This was quite unique, as much of the economic literature is conceptual rather than empirical.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding work.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in economic history, crisis management, or just wanting to better understand what happened in the last decade.	2003-03-17

The main research methodology is that of general urban anthropology, meaning that the author bases his findings on thousands of observations of consumers in stores and then tries to synthesize his findings.<br />I found the book very useful in drawing attention to the importance of observation in determining store layout, and some of the main conclusions are very enlightning, such as suggestions on how the different shopping behaviors of men, women, children and the elderly affect the optimal layout of a store.  Issues such as shelf height and location, corridor width, and customer profiling are dealt with in many different examples, giving the reader a good understanding of the methodology and the main lessons learned.<br />Overall, I recommend this book to someone who is somehow responsible for a retail environment.  The lessons are good, the book is written in an engaging manner, and the method of thinking (observational) is presented in a convincing manner.

The author focuses on Venezuela, with occasional reference to other countries.<br />The main thesis is that aside from the traditional Dutch disease of such intense exporters, there is an organizational component in the downfall of such plenty.  For example, she argues that a large self-serving infrastructure and bureaucracy is built around the &quot;pot of gold&quot;.  She argues this may be one of the main causes that coutnries squander such valuable resources without ever refocusing them on the development of people (health and education) or the country's economy (such as through the extension of value-added activities).<br />Overall, an interesting proposition, though I am not sure this is a phenomenon unique to countries faced with the plenty of oil or other products.  It is a strong case that inefficiencies are added through bureaucracies, but I still believe much of the damage is caused by the traditional Dutch disease.	2003-03-11

The author is a very good storyteller, and he does manage to give the reader a good insight into Silicon Valley culture, so if you are really interested in it, this is a book for you.  If you are just looking for a good story, &quot;Liar's Poker&quot;, by the same author, is a much more entertaining story.	2003-03-11

This reader does a good job of putting together some representative readings, starting from their most famous \\"The Communist Manifesto\\", going into his analysis of revolutions and conditions in many different countries, including France, India, Russia, etc., finally reaching into topics such as family and morality (mainly addressed by Engels).<br />Though not a Marxist myself, I found this compilation a very comprehensive view of their thinking.  It should be sufficient to anyone not seeking to write a dissertation on their thinking.	2003-03-11

For example, Franklin made sure people had an impression of his being a hard worker, by keeping his lights on till very late and by making sure people saw him leaving his work very late.  Translated to today's world, such a rule could be translated into the realm of &quot;face time&quot;.  Like this one, the rules in the book are timeless.<br />My only concern about the book is the limited historical scope of it.  It focuses on the period before Franklin got involved with politics and the revolution, so the more interesting parts of his life are not present.  When I grabbed this book, I was expecting both a management lesson and a history one; forget the history one.<br />One should keep in mind the title of the book: 12 Rules of MANAGEMENT.  That is very accurate, and it is clear that those rules are focused on management and NOT leadership.  If you are looking for good manager advice, this is a very good book.	2003-03-11

It deals in depth with the Brady bonds and their origins and valuation.  It also gives an introduction to the methodology that was subsequently used in the Brady bond retirements.  From this perspective, it is very useful.<br />However, there is very little in the sense of a concrete future of the financial environment around the world.  It precedes the 1997 and 1998 crises, which makes the warnings in the book interesting if not useful.  I wish the authors would update it to include more recent developments, which would make it much more readable and interesting.  As it is, it is more history than finance.	2003-03-09

I read it as part of an international politics course in college, and it drew inflamed critism from many students who found it biased and bigoted.<br />I decided to revisit the book more recently, especially given the recent conflicts between the U.S. and the Middle East, and found that the author has conclusions that contain much predictive power, which would have benefitted decision makers had they understood it.  The basic premise is that there are 7 civilization and that future conflict will be draw along civilization lines rather than country borders.  It is a generally theoretical book, for someone interested in general system dynamics.  There is not enough information on individual conflict dynamics, so someone interested in a clash between two particular civilizations is better off looking elsewhere.	2003-03-09

This is not a new concept, as many other authors, such as Lawrence Harrison, have grappled with the issue of culture in economic development.<br />Fukuyama slices culture and focuses particularly on the issue of trust, as the bond that reduces transactions costs.  The literature on transactions costs is also vast, initiated by Coase in the 1930s.<br />The main contribution of this book is to establish an empirical link between trust and the reduction of transactions costs which consequently account for a more friction-less economy.  However, as a non-economist, Fukuyama writes to the international relations and political science professional, as a respected scholar mainly in these circles.  As such, he does a good job of bringing somewhat theoretical economic concepts to the forefront of policy makers.	2003-03-09

It introduces the concept that culture (in the form of the protestant ethic) is better adapted to fit capitalism.  Therefore, capitalist growth was found more frequently in protestant societies than in others.<br />Since Webber, there has been much study of this topic, with some of the main names being Lawrence Harrison (focusing on the culture of underdevelopment) and Francis Fukuyama (focusing on how trusting societies benefit economically).  Both and others push the frontiers initially established by Webber.<br />Though controversial especially today in the period of political correctness, Webber presents a strong mainly anecdotal case (given the absense of many statistical tools at the time) of why protestant societies succeed in capitalism; his main argument (though there are many other important ones) is that it is socially acceptable in protestant societies to make a profit, whereas it may be considered immoral in other societies, such as catholic ones.<br />This is a good theoretical book with a few good anecdotes.  It is for someone interested in the history of sociology, especially as it pertains to economics.  If you are just looking for a link between culture or religion and economics, look at Larry Harrison.	2003-03-09

It is written in a funny and self-deprecating tone, which is refreshing given the usual self-aggrandisement tone of mountaineering adventures.  Of course, the author is not an accomplished mountaineer, but rather an observer who happens to be on the mountain.<br />He does spend a bit too much time going through the full description of characters on the mountain that season, the first since Pakistan allowed climbers back after a long hiatus.  However, I guess it is best to err on the heavier side of character development, so it is okay.  It is a quick fun read, if not life-changing like many mountaineering books seem to try to be.	2003-03-09

Read it really quickly, and was very inspired to try out mountaineering, despite the tragic nature of the book.  Krakauer takes the reader through a very entertaining tale of valour and foolishness that cost 7 lives.<br />However, I have a few negative comments on the book.  1st, a lot of people seem to think there are many inaccuracies, so I am not really sure what happened, especially as it refers to Anatoli Boukreev.  Boukreev actually wrote a rebuttal \\"The Climb\\" which is also popular, but it seem that the two were on two different mountains.  My second comment is that Krakauer does not respect people's privacy, as he mentions tales of love affaris among the group's members (some of whom were married).  I know sex sells, so that's probably why he did it, but I really did not see the need in what is an otherwise enthralling book.	2003-03-09

It is written from the perspective of an international lawyer, which means there is little actual applications in here for the practitioner from the banking or user perspectives.  It includes some interesting information that would save a lot of time to compile, such as the existence of &quot;true sale&quot; financial flow transactions in certain countries, but it is sparse.<br />To me, the most interesting aspect of this book is the historical one, showing how much emerging markets securtiizations have evolved since it was published.	2003-03-09

There is a good reason for it: reading it is fun.  Alex Rogo is a peculiar character, one that incorporates portions of the regular company manager, myself included.<br />The context is exciting (the company may close his plant if he does not improve results, his wife may leave him) and makes for an entertaining setting in which to teach the theory of contraints.  We follow Alex as he first has an epiphany while camping with his son and meets the prophetic Herby; he then starts to apply some of those concepts in his factory, improving results immediately.  Then we see him arguing with Peach, the proverbial upper manager who doesn't understand (a little Dilbert-esque).<br />I very strongly recommend it both as a fiction novel and as a learning tool.  In my opinion, getting this book is a win-win proposition.	2003-03-09

One interesting conclusion that I would like to read more about is the fact that she finds that higher imports are in fact more important than higher exports in the development of a country.<br />This is a book of impecable analysis and good sensible economic recommendations, though it will contradict much of what anti-globalizers think is true.	2003-03-09

Using a number of parables and metaphors, the author uses the voyage as a process of self discovery.  In the voyage, many birds fall by the wayside, while their leader questions them why they are giving up; these questions are the same questions, in theory, everyone should be asking themselves.<br />The translation is very good, though sometimes I questioned the fidelity of it, since it was rhymed in Persian and the author made it rhyme in English as well.<br />As a comparison, Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist has some similar lessons (such as seeking oneself), but Farid's work is much more subtle and interesting from the point of view of allegories and symbolism.  Of course, in the end there is a surprise in both, but I will leave it to the reader to find out.	2003-03-08

I believe it is the first written by a former slave in the U.S., and it clearly outlines the disputes surrounding the anti-slavery movement and the movement for the then status quo.<br />Though slavery is long gone in the U.S., it is useful to reflect on the process that lasted for many centuries before it was successful.  In his case, we see how his masters, who were often considered more benign than other masters, tried to prevent Frederick from learning how to read, arguing that reading was beyond their needs.<br />Aside from the historical importance of this book, we also have a very interesting character in Frederick, as he is not resentful but rather fair and refined, which I believed added much to his reputation as a leader of the anti-slavery movement.	2003-03-08

I found the travel perspective of the book to be fascinating, and since I read it I have thought many times about doing the trek myself.<br />As for the personal revelation the author encounters in the trek, I foudn them interesting, not overwhelming.  The lessons learned are presented in many different books aside form this one; what makes this book a little special, I believe, is that the story involves the reader in such a way that the lessons are driven effortlessly.	2003-03-07

This segmentation is useful as we are able to see how these can be used in separate occasions to be persuasive.  However, from then on, the book gets long-winded and with not enough stories.<br />Overall, there are interesting arguments with good stories, and it definitely convinced me to start using stories, so I guess it was successful.	2003-03-07

The story of how Eli Cohen infiltrated the Syrian leadership by first travelling to Argentina and gaining the support of local leaders to only then move to Syria and become a trusted advisor is nothing short of amazing.<br />The most entertaining story, among many, was how he advised the Syrian military leadership to plant large trees to provide shade to its soldiers.  When Israel looked, all the major Syrian positions were marked by large trees, making any confrontation a piece of cake.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in spies.  It is also an interesting story to realize how he was finally caught, though I am not sure it really was unintentional.	2003-03-05

It is devoid of any sentimental issues, rather focusing on the pragmatic aspects of change.<br />For example, he does not believe Ghandi was a pacifist from the beginning; he believes Ghandi realized that pacifism was the most effective approach in that case, so he chose it. If Ghandi had had guns and people to fight, Alinsky believes that Ghandi would have fought with guns. The book is full of similar stories that give life to the beliefs of the author.  He also gives a blueprint of what the characteristics he believes make up a good radical organizer, and methods for such an organizer to better communicate with his audience.<br />This book is great for the radical who has a clue of what he would like to achieve and needs some help figuring out how to do it. It is not for someone simply seeking inspiration to make society better.	2003-03-05

The main theory revolves around the fact that contacts within our social circle usually do not have access to information we do not already have; in order to get new information, we need to extend social circles and reach for those with whom we do not have constant contact.<br />Through a very academic approach to the problem, the scientific approach is best to help us understand how people get jobs.  I originally read this book as an undergraduate in a labor economics course, and I have recently consulted it again (10yrs later) and found many insights I had not caught the first time around.	2003-03-05

It is written in short article form, making it especially useful as a quick reference guide to very specific issues.<br />The issues addressed can be either very general (like what is a family business and general statistics on them), to very specific (like estate planning, succession, board recruitment, conflict resolution).  The authors also address the topic from different perspectives; there are chapters on people entering family businesses (family members and non family members), on consultants to fmaily businesses, on spouses of family business members, on investors in family businesses, and the expected focus on family managers in family businesses.<br />I have not seen a better compilation of topics.  Despite the fact that it is a compilation, all topics are addressed with enough depth to make it sufficient reading on any individual topic of family business.	2003-03-03

The author was Apple Computer's chief evangelist, and I myself an Apple evangelist, really enjoyed the author's description of the product evangelism process, of which I was part as a customer.<br />The authro uses some analogies, like &quot;eat like a bird, poop like an elephant&quot;, which oozes unconventional thinking, however the topics he addresses are pretty standard.  Rather than innovative thinking, I think this is a good way of repackaging thoughts into a coherent framework.<br />It seems to try to speak to the actors of the internet revolution in their language, which in many ways alienates some of the other audiences.

For example, using the framework developed in this book, it is easy to understand why the many recent coup attempts in Venezuela have failed (both by Chavez and the more recent one against him).  Every time there is a coup I find myself referring back to the book in order to determine if there were any telltale signs to predict whether the coup will be successful or not.<br />His basic framework involves timing, media control and popular support, and government organizational structure.  With these factors in mind, the author examines a large number of coups, both successful and failed.  The inner stories of many of these coups is fascinating by itself, yet the author does a good job of telling the tale while drawing the main lessons from it.	2003-02-23

It is especially useful given that Israel fights battles not unlike the ones America is fighting today.  I think the major drawback of this book is the lack of cases (there are only a few, with more emphasis on policies) which would definitely make the read much more entertaining.<br />I do not necessarily agree with Netanyahu's politics, but I found in this book a fresh source of ideas, with no political leanings.	2003-02-22

Cervantes' classic is timeless, bringing to life all human emotions, often at once.  The book swings between absolute optimism, tragedy, despair, humor (a ton of wit everywhere), love, all within the realm of an insane (?) character.<br />Don Quixote is a nobleman who, after reading for years about chivalry (the middle ages type), decides to set on a journey to right the wrongs in Spain.  He is accompanied by Sancho Panza, his squire (and sane companion), to who he promises the governorship of the first island they conquer.<br />Cervantes obviously pokes fun at the middle ages concept of nobility and chivalry, as he pits Quixote in battles against monsters (who are actually windmills),  All of Quixote's battles are in the honor of his love, Dulcinia, who never makes an appearance, and seems to be an idealized character, also similar to the idealized dames of the middle ages.  Cervantes' wit vis a vis the chivalry concept is even more interesting when taken in the context of who Cervantes was: a wounded soldier who spend a good portion of his life as a captive in prison.  It seems he may have been driven to war by the ideals of chivalry, but was soon rebuffed by the realities of the world.  It is clear he seeks to unmask it.<br />In Quixote's insanity, however, we can see through the strange magic that creates emotions such as love and hatred.  Irrationality is not something that can be dismissed, as so much of human activity (and Quixote's in particular) is not driven by pure rationality.<br />Though written in 1605, the insight into the human soul is timeless.	2003-02-22

It goes beyond simply proposing systems thinking to delve into the art of managing complexity (as the title mentions).<br />The book is in fact divided into two portions.  The first is an in depth description of systems thinking, a somewhat dry read, given the extreme density of the subject.  The second is a number of case studies with which the author was involved.  This section, in my opinion, is the most interesting part of the book, as Gharajedaghi shows us how he applies, in practice, what he preaches.  There is one story in particular, about the Oneida indian nation, that is simply delightful; I believe it yields significant lessons for anyone seeking to work with development, but is locked into a purely economic standpoint.	2003-02-18

Instead of a big bang, McKinnon suggests a particular order to economic liberalization in order to maintain some stability during the transition process.  He uses many examples to show that, for example, fiscal stability should come first, which is a lesson that has proven itself current with Argentina's and Turkey's cases in the early 2000s.  This is a book that, though has a strong economics foundation, leaves something to be desired in terms of rigour of economic analysis.  Instead, it was written I think particularly for the usage of policy-makers who may not be familiar with technical economic jargon.	2003-02-17

Using examples from biology (epidemics of AIDS, flu), history (Paul Revere), and pop culture (Kevin Bacon's six degrees), the author is able to create a framework to help understand how epidemics (of any sort) begin and end. His framework is based on three components that make it both easy to understand and to apply.<br />I have two objections, however. One, perhaps the author is not familiar with differential equations, but the book could have benefited from a few pages on the actual mathematics of the so called \\"tipping point\\". Two, the author often goes into excrutiating detail (especially when he writes about Blues Clues) when it seems unnecessary. I definitely recommend this book, but feel free to skip the portion about Blues Clues.	2003-02-17

It is not really a good teaching source, as I thought it already starts with a fair amount of assumed previous knowledge and jargon.<br />The sections that are most well developed are the ones on inventory management and transportation logistics, where I found examples that were directly applicable to situations I encountered in a retail environment.  The portion on forecasting was not as useful, and the part on e-business seemed somewhat contrived.  Overall, this is the best reference I have found that does not require a heavy amount of mathematical familiarity.	2003-02-17

Of course, given its publication in 1995, not much more could be expected.  However, if you are looking for a good understanding of Latin America's main eocnomies, it is not sufficient, since the changes that most countries have faced in the 1990s and early 2000s are dramatic.  For example, there is very little in this book dealing with privatization (the wave that hit the region in the early 1990s), or even the control of inflation and the (limited) opening of markets to international trade.<br />Given all that has happened since its publication, it is good history, but does not reflect the current reality.	2003-02-17

However, from the perspective of game theory, it leaves much to be desired, as it does not seek to define the major theories and it does not provide a reasonable explanation for the particular tools and their application.<br />It is clear that the book is written for those not interested in the more technical aspects of game theory, so if that is you, you should consider this book.  It seems to me, however, that the organization of this book is missing exactly what the book purports to deliver: strategic thinking.	2003-02-17

Mersault, the main character, is an amoral person, who floats through life as things seem to happen to him without plan or purpose.  He eventually commits a murder, in a manner that it is not clear why.<br />To me, it was a tale about sense and judgment.  The author created a microcosm, inside the character, of what the world would be like if there were no morals.  The bonds existing between human beings are removed, and all that is left is an empty and unemotional person.<br />I highly recommend it, as a picture of where the world would be if we removed the shared experiences of humans.	2003-02-17

I find that most textbooks are good as reference, not as learning tools, but this book is an exception.  In a very concise manner, it builds theory upon theory of international trade, until the student has developed a strong set of analysis tools.  The portion on international finance is good intro as well, even though it does not compare with more specialized texts.  This text is sufficient to prepare the reader for any advanced trade issues, with the exception of more mathematically based arguments (which the book does not develop, given its focus on beginners).	2003-02-17

I read it when I was one, and was very inspired. More recently I reread it, and found it nothing special.

At the time it was published, this was absolutely in contradiction with development economics.  Even today it is not widely accepted by policy-makers.  It is essential reading in the literature of financial liberalization, as perhaps its seminal work.	2003-02-17

However, as someone who knows a bit about the derivatives business, it is clear that the author tries to sensationalize the transactions, using the expression &quot;ripping someone's face off&quot; too often.  Clients of investment banks are, for the most part, very experienced financial managers, who generally choose complex financial structures because these are the structures that exactly fit their needs.  It is very rare (I have never seen it) that a customer would buy something he was not thoroughly familiar with.  My only conclusion can be that the author was eager to write a book, and so chose every single transaction he was exposed to and created the image that customers were always innocent bystanders.	2003-02-17

The examples cover a lot of possibilities, to the point that whenever I need to model something complex I pick up the book and often find a situation very similar to the one I am faced with.  I believe it does require a good familiarity with excel in order to follow the book, so if you have it, this is a very good guide to LPs and all sorts of decision analysis.	2003-02-17

This is a sensationalist book for non-economists who wish to sound like they know economics.<br />The premisse is that the world will be in trouble because productivity is rising too fast (faster than demand) and so prices will plummet, so will earnings, and so will standards of living.  This is the old argument that leads to the conclusion that one day robots will do it all and there will be nothing for humans to do.  It is an argument that has been refuted, as it is clear that, as soon as we are able to produce more of something than we can consume, we move on to produce other things that are needed.  The author assumes there is a limit to things and services that can be produced, which has not been the case and there is no reason to believe that it will be.<br />This is inane economics for the populist mind at its best.	2003-02-17

In different chapters, the author treats separate delusions which, at first sight, the reaction is that it could not happen today, until we see all that does in fact go on in the world.<br />I found the South Sea Bubble and the Dutch Tulipmania the two most outstanding cases.  The analysis, given its dated nature, serves more as an image of historical thought.  I would recommend one to read the chapter on Social Proof in CIaldini's Influence book, it goes into many of the issues that set off the manias.	2003-02-17

As an economist, I was especially interested in the &quot;rational&quot; school, and was not disappointed.  Of course many of the scholar transcend economics and sociology (Herbert Simon, Mancur Olson), but I found it interesting to see concepts that I had treated as predominantly economic from a different perspective.  Also interesting to read about Marx in the context of all other who followed him in the &quot;conflict&quot; tradition.<br />This book is great for those who would like to have an overall good knowledge of sociology without spending the time to read the actual founders of the field's works.	2003-02-17

It is not easy (as economic growth is not), but it is definitely within the grasp of economics undergraduate with knowledge of basic economic principles. It also provides sufficient advance material in the second half of the book to stimulate further study into economic growth. However, beware that this is not a book about policy prescriptions for economic growth, it is about the theoretical framework to understand it (necessary, but not sufficient for policy prescriptions).	2003-02-17

The book is very densely written, and definitely aimed at those taking graduate level courses (with a good mathematical background).

It describes, in great detail, the policies adopted in each country that are believed to have spurred such development; to its credit (being a World Bank book), it even suggests that some unorthodox policies may have been beneficial, even though it does suggest that these benefits are not there to be reaped again by a country trying to emulate them.  One of the main arguments is also that income distribution improvements have been a common experience across these countries, which is a topic not often discussed in development economics.<br />There are, however, some obvious fallacies in this book.  Having been written pre-1997 crisis, it does highlight the strenght of the banking system in many of these countries; these banking systems were later to be blamed for much of the pain in the 1997 crisis.<br />I find this book fascinating, not as a source of development ideas (those can be found elsewhere), but due to the historical context in which it was written (praising economies that were about to collapse).  Of course, these economies are still better off that most developing countries, so I do not believe that they are mistaken in many points, but there are certain contradictions that arose with the crisis that make it worth reading this book to determine what is good advice and what is hot air.	2003-02-16

With logic, the author begins to tear apart many widely held views by the movement's founders and drivers, which have absolutely no factual basis.<br />For all those interested in the history of economic development thoght, this book is very interesting and educational.  For those interested in Brazil, I especially recommend it, as Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former president, was one of the main founders of the movement.  Of course, when he became a leader, he did ask that people &quot;forget what he wrote&quot; and adopted a strong economically orthodox stand.	2003-02-16

With a bias more towards history than economics, the book reads like storytelling sometimes, with less analysis than I had hoped for.  The description of today's Brazilian economy is shorter than I had hoped for, but sufficient for a basic introduction.<br />The book serves as reference as well for any historical fact affecting Brazil's economy, especially in the late 20th century.	2003-02-16

Fernando Henrique Cardoso, one of the authors who later became president of Brazil, changed his posture and ended up becoming one of the strongest supporters of orthodox economic policy.  This book is important in the history fo economic thought in Latin America, but one should not forget the context in which it was written and it may be a good idea to read it in conjunction with the many works that have been written since on the fallacies of thought in the dependency movement.	2003-02-16

The stories in this book are extremely thought provoking, relating to the human spirit and little oddities about people.<br />There is one story in particular that I will not forget.  It is about a woman who gets stranded with a flat tire, and hitches a ride with a bus to a mental institution.  The story unfolds from there, and I don't think I have ever felt so deeply troubled by a single story like I was in this case.  Of the twelve stories, I liked 8 or 9, the others were a little boring (or maybe I did not get them).  I highly recommend it, especially for those who do not have the patience to read GM's &quot;One Hundred Years of SOlitude&quot; and would like an intro to the author.	2003-02-16

Instead, this turned out to be a self-help book about how to gain it, without ever showing that the techniques presented are really effective from any standpoint(scientific or otherwise).<br />I had the distinct feeling while reading the book that I was being convinced to take up yoga, rather than charisma. When I bought this book, I was skeptical that charisma could be taught; I am now even more convinced.	2003-02-16

In fact, Garcia Marquez generally refers to Bolivar as Liberator in the book.<br />I really enjoyed the read, as GM paints a picture of someone who once was powerful and begins to degenerate, both in terms of power and body.  He re-lives many of Bolivar's loves, while the general becomes more and more disheartened by the lack of love the people show for him.  He reminices about the times when the arrival of Bolivar in any city was cause for tremendous celebration.  We almost join the general on his last few days, as one former lover, who once was young and beautiful, joins him, and we enjoy the loyalty of his last few warriors, who refuse to leave him.<br />It is definitely a departure from GM's usual novels, but worth a try especially for the historical nature of Bolivar and the novel.  I also read &quot;The October of the Patriarch&quot;, which seems to touch on the same issues (of a powerful man getting old and weak), but I thought this book was better because of the realism GM brings into it, which Latin America's prime independence figure as protagonist.	2003-02-16

Waltz, one fo the premier figures of realpolitik, argues (brilliantly, even though I disagree with him) that proliferation is a good idea.  Sagan argues there are too many organizational risks in the proliferation system.<br />The two present their arguments, and then respond to each other's argument.  It is a fascinating argument, one that can be discussed in 1000 pages, but the authors do a tremendous job of synthesizing it and pointing out the major strenghts and weaknesses of each other's argument.  In today's world, where we are willing to go to war to prevent proliferation, it is useful to take a step back and really understand what the main problems arising by proliferation are.	2003-02-16

It is one of Amado's best known works, if not the best one.  The story depicts Gabriela, a sensous free spirited woman who migrates from famine to the city of Ilheus, where her story meshes with the city's story to form a great mixture.  Gabriela works as a cook, and torments the hearts of men with her sensous and pure nature, while she delicately touches the revolving life of the city.<br />The book also depicts with great detail the culture of the region, with special focus on the food.  If you have ever been to Bahia, you will know how unique the tastes there are.  This book leaves such a taste in the mouth.  If you are planning to go on tourism to the Brazilian Northeast, this book should help raise the anticipation level.	2003-02-16

I definitely understood Drucker's point that innovation and entrepreneurship come out of changes in the environment.<br />However, I believe Drucker missed the most important point, which is: What makes someone more able to exploit an opportunity than someone else?  For example, he tells a story about how Ray Krok found out about McDonalds, bought it, and made it great.  However, I thought he should have focused on why it was Ray Krok, and no one else, who saw the opportunity, rather than how he bought and made McDonalds.  It is an entertaining read, but do not expect any lessons on how to be an entrepreneur.	2003-02-14

After having read some of Becker's other books, I came to the conclusion that this book is two things:<br />1) An easy to understand intro to the usage of economic principles to solve problems.  Becker's other books were essentially on similar topics, but with a much more rigorous analysis.<br />2) An intro to new topics that could be approached from a much more rigorous standpoint.  Becker's curious mind actually points out to many issues (such as immigration, affirmative action, and many other gov't issues) that would benefit from a more rigorous economic approach.<br />Good entertainment value, with about 80% of essays really interesting and the rest fillers.	2003-02-13

For example, why does no one help a person in need when there is a crowd around?  Why do we feel obligated to contribute to people who are nice to us, or who have given us a gift, even if the gift has a very low value compared to the contribution being asked.

It goes over, in substantial detail, all the factors you may face (medicine, visas, hotels, transportation, tours, trails, etc.).  However, there is very little on the trekking peaks, which I thought would be the most interesting portion of the book.

It basically describes, without much analysis, the types of policies retailers adopt in several areas including merchandising, inventory management, ordering, HR, finance, store layout, etc.  Good as a reference to what others are doing, but not at the cutting edge of retail.	2003-02-12

It develops on the concept of &quot;predispositioning&quot;, taking it from the initial development in chess, to all aspects of life.  Predisposition is a concept that can be used as a guide to life, as the author presents cases in which he used it to improve his position (an analogy to chess).	2003-02-12

For example, Becker provides a rationale for altruistic behavior emerging in society, and he studies crime from the the perspective of a market economy of criminal activity.  The book is somewhat technical, so a somewhat quantitative background is recommended.	2003-02-11

He also touches on arguments related to monopolies (and when they should and should not be curbed by regulation).  Despite the deep implications, it is written in an easily readable format.	2003-02-11

This book is a very good supplement to any economics library, as it seeks to develop ideas of idealized designs for a country to gain development. It seeks to understand what parameters predispose a country for development, rather than taking the usual hands-off approach classical economics does. It takes the \\"transaction economics\\" ideas developed by Williamson and Coase one step further, in order to understand how those could be minimized in the countrywide sense. If you are looking for fresh ideas on what it takes for development, this is the book for you.	2002-10-22
