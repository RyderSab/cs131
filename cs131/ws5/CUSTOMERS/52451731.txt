As a kid, he grew up speaking it with his English grandmother and he spent the rest of his life ransacking the treasure-chest of English and American literature.  In a famous prose-poem published in 1960, \\"Borges and I\\", he could cite Robert Louis Stevenson's prose as one his favorite things (alongside the taste of coffee and the strumming of a guitar).  And even after he lost his eyesight in mid-age, most of the books he went on reading in his mind were in English.    Consequently, he sounds good in translation.  It's tough to make Neruda or Lorca or even a lot of novelists writing in Spanish sound clear and convincing in English.  Lorca, for example, wrote in a distinctively Andalusian idiom, and nobody who has never read his poetry in the original can understand how stilted he sounds in English.  Borges, by contrast, had a more universal intellect and the strands of his writing span many non-Hispanic cultures.  His reading in many different literatures left a deep imprint on him linguistically and helps explain why his work translates so well into other languages.  While it's true that much of his poetry has a distinctly Argentine \\"flavor\\", it has many other flavors, as well.  Depending on the poem, Borges can evoke Quevedo, Leopoldo Lugones, \\"Beowulf\\", the Icelandic Prose Edda, Whitman, Omar Khayyam, or Ralph Waldo Emerson.  And yet the English influence is present in virtually all of his work.    Thirteen translators are featured in this anthology and the quality varies.  Barnstone and Merwin are, as usual, impeccably accurate and 1000% unadventurous.  Robert Fitzgerald shows yet again that his last name must be some kind of cosmic byword for quality (F. Scott, Edward, Ella, now Robert...).  His version of \\"Odyssey, Book Twenty-Three\\" is breathtakingly tight and sweeping, actually more of a rendition than a word-for-word translation.  Unlike Barnstone's somewhat stilted versions of Borges' sonnets, Fitzgerald manages to stickto the original rhyme-scheme without sounding forced.  Unfortunately, he only did five poems in this book.  ¡Qué lastima!    Alistair Reid did most of the work here.  Reid is a perfect example of a fine translator who did some really great stuff back in the '60s, then apparently revised it to make stuffy literalists like Barnstone happy.  For example, he took an excellent translation of \\"Limits\\" (which appeared in a 1967 book called \\"A Personal Anthology\\", which basically launched Borges's reputation in the United States) and altered it to make the words stick more closely to the original Spanish word order.  It's still a good translation and all, but not as good as the first one.	2004-02-16

Like fellow New England poet Robert Frost, Edwin Arlington Robinson helped limber up traditional, rhymed American verse, steering it away from the stilted and bombastic norms of the 19th century while also avoiding free verse.  More importantly, Robinson wrote about \\"the other half\\" -- drunks, dreamers, women-chasers, narcissistic suicides, jettisoned lover-boys, devastated widows, brutal misers.   By doing so, he paved the way for the modernist obsesssion with the \\"common man\\".  (In fact, he is still best known for his biting characterizations of Luke Havergal, Richard Cory, and Cliff Klingenhagen).  A tense but satirical electricity runs through all of his work.  As Frost said, \\"Robinson's theme was unhappiness itself, but his skill was as happy as it was playful...  His life was a revel in the felicities of language.\\"<br />The earlier poetry is predominately concerned with failure and misery, \\"the withered souls of men\\", as Robinson put it.  (Robinson wrote much this poetry while working as a ticket collector on the New York subway, not long out of Harvard).  Men have paid a price for their innocence and are unable, like Zola (whom he praises in a poem) to look squarely at the \\"compromising chart of hell\\" they have created.  Great democratic mobs judge each others' grief, a grief they can seldom comprehend.  Writers worship \\"the flicker and not the flame\\".  Misery and the passing of things toll like a villanelle in most of Robinson's early work:  \\"There is ruin and decay,\\" \\"long centuries have come and gone,\\" the world seems to be churning toward the \\"western gate\\" of darkness, death's portal.<br />By contrast, the more mature Robinson is more interested in light and voices and spiritual illumination.  He sees great value in our intellectual and spiritual struggles, our so-called \\"modern\\" ideas, even though they may be \\"some day be quaint as any [tale] told / In almagest or chronicle of old.\\"  The older Robinson does not fight against the ultimately unknowable realities.  He is not a disjointed Romantic raging against the misnamed \\"encroachments\\" of time.  He is glad that reality remains a mystery in the end, a great and indecipherable code of silent stars and sheaves of girl-like, golden wheat that speak love in their very silence.  The world, like true poetry, has \\"a mighty meaning of a kind / That tells the more the more it is not told.\\"<br />I bought this book several years ago in Malta during a bout of homesickness and it has been blowing my mind ever since.

So this guide helped me brush up on some of my &quot;practical&quot; Spanish for an upcoming trip to the Sierra Madre, Sonora and Chihuahua.  You would probably be better off knowing some basic Spanish before messing with this guide, but it's not 100% essential.  The authors use dialogues with topical themes, like &quot;Can I cross your land?&quot; or &quot;Hey, my truck broke down&quot;.  The dialogues and vocabulary lists highlight colloquial Mexican usage and point out some backcountry &quot;linguistic etiquette&quot; (like addressing people as &quot;amigo&quot; instead of &quot;señor&quot;, which is perfectly acceptable in the backcountry).  The vocabulary lists here are also great, with a bunch of practical terms arranged thematically.<br />This isn't just a phrasebook, though.  It's also a guide to the practicalities of getting around and enjoying the backcountry and how to behave in situations that most city-hopping tourists just don't encounter.  A lot of rural Mexicans (in places like inland Chihuahua, for example) rarely meet tourists and are often offended by arrogant or just plain ignorant gringos who don't necessarily mean offense.  This guide addresses some issues like how to ask for permission to cross somebody's land or what to do if you need to ask directions from a woman if the man of the house isn't around.  It's also just generally a useful &quot;how to&quot; guide to hiking and camping in rural Mexico.<br />Great book.  Worth taking with you.	2004-01-28

Already nostalgiac about the days \\"when planes still had some human qualities in their imperfection and pilots did not yet look like space men,\\" Saint-Ex sank into depression, retired to a room in Algiers to work on \\"Flight to Arras\\", then in the winter of 1943/44 met a young half-Welsh, half-American, Algerian-born photographer for LIFE, John Phillips.  Phillips spoke fluent French and pilot and photographer became close friends.  Phillips eventually managed to convince the commander of the Allied air squadron at Naples to let Saint-Ex have one last go at the skies, and as a result, he was sent up to the air base at Alghero, Sardinia, and during the summer of 1944 was allowed to fly reconaissance missions over Nazi-occupied France.  On the last of these missions, July 31st, Saint-Exup&eacute;ry disappeared, presumably shot down near Grenoble.<br />This book is a collection of photographs Phillips made for LIFE magazine at the air base in Sardinia during the last days of Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's life, alongside a personal memoir published in 1959.  Phillips' photos show us the classic Saint-Ex:  left eyebrow hitched up into indifferent nonchalance by a scar he received during a botched landing in Guatemala;  writer and friends enjoying some bleary-eyed, wine-induced moments of camaraderie around a table outside in the sun;  Saint-Ex looking miserable as somebody helps him into his flying suit.<br />Phillips' short memoir is full of insight into Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's character.  \\"The reason Saint-Ex spoke no English,\\" Phillips writes, \\"was simple.  A perfectionist, he refused to manipulate words clumsily in a foreign language and so distort his thoughts.  He would hold forth on the advantages of not speaking English in New York.  'When I need a cup of coffee, I walk up to acharming waitress and describe with gestures a cup, a saucer, a spoon, coffee, cream and sugar.  This makes her smile.  Why should I go to all the trouble of learning Engilsh and lose that smile?'  In his enjoyment of his ignorance of the language, he created an enchanting world that isolated him from baseness as surely as the cockpit of a plane at ten thousand feet.\\"<br />This book also includes Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's \\"Letter to an American\\", which ought to be required reading now that France and the U.S. would rather kill each other than remember everything they've got in common.	2003-12-11

True, the maps in this guide are not EXTREMELY detailed, but if you want a really detailed topographical map, you can always get one.  The actual trail descriptions in this book are painstakingly detailed -- it even gets tedious.  So if you can't find every tree along your route marked on the maps here, just use your imagination a little and wing it.<br />&quot;Walking in Spain&quot; describes thirty or so of the best trails in Spain, highlighting trails in Mallorca, the Alpujarras Mountains of Andalusia, the area around Valencia, Castile's Sierra de Gredos and Sierra de Guadarrama, the Spanish Pyrenees, Galicia, and the Cordillera Cantábrica.  Hikes vary from longer hauls like the 23-day Pyrenean traverse and the month-long Camino de Santiago to shorter 5- and 6-day hikes and walks you can do in less than a day.<br />I've used the guide to get some great ideas for an upcoming hiking trip to the Alpujarras Mountains and the Sierra Nevada and have found it extremely useful.  It lists numerous places to stay, ranging from 30- and 40-euro &quot;pensiones&quot; to dirt-cheap hikers' &quot;albergues&quot;.  You're not going to find a list of every single cheap place to crash your head here (if you did, you would have a book twice as big as this one), but you won't find yourself stranded.  There's also a bunch of affordable eating places listed in this book.<br />A plus for hikers who want to tackle all or part of the famous St. James pilgrimage route is that the guide's recommended day-to-day itinerary drops you off at the end of each day in towns where you can get food and water.  A chart also shows the distance between each official &quot;albergue&quot; and the next.<br />This book comes up a little short on cultural information, but you can always take a look at Lonely Planet's general guide to Spain.  Recommended.  Five stars.	2003-10-26

In Scandinavia, two regional schools of art -- in Finland and Norway -- were in tune with the mainstream of European nationalist art, always fascinated by questions of ethnicity.  (Neither Finland nor Norway become independent until after 1900, from Russia and Sweden respectively).  In those countries, artists like Akseli Gallen-Kallela and Erik Werenskiold chose to focus on earthy folk themes in order to emphasize the cultural distinctiveness of Finns and Norwegians.<br />In Sweden, however, nationalist art took a different turn.  Sweden had already been independent for several hundred years, and Swedish artists like Richard Bergh, Karl Nordström, Anders Zorn and Carl Larsson were thus less concerned about their country's ethnic uniqueness than about issues like social equality, women's rights and the environment.  While \\"Swedishness\\" played a very important role in their art, the concept was a highly progressive and socially-conscious one, in no way narrowly chauvinistic.  \\"Swedishness\\" embodied these artists' ideas about what kind of country Sweden must become and how to create an ideal Sweden.<br />As Michelle Facos argues in this book, the 1890s were the cradle of modern Sweden, a decade that gave birth to the social-utopian ideals that make this country today so distinct.  The emphasis in turn-of-the-century art that was placed on concepts like human rootedness in the land, pride in the nation's social accomplishments, and the potentials of peace rather than war led to a vigorous national regeneration in Sweden after 1900.  And as Facos points out, \\"the impact of these artists' endeavors on the taste and values of twentieth-century Sweden cannot be overstated.\\"  Even in the decorative arts, Swedes experienced a kind of regeneration.  For as the contemporary writer William Morris wrote, \\"external beauty is a symbol of a decent and reasonable life.\\"<br />In \\"Nationalism & the Nordic Imagination,\\" Facos looks at some of the themes that Swedish \\"National Romantic\\" painters dealt with during the 1890s.  Grounded in ideas like primitivism, rootedness, symbolism, and the value of historical painting, Swedish art was also part of a larger Scandinavian and European context, which Facos explores, relating Swedish art to the work of painters like Gauguin, Puvis de Chavannes, and Van Gogh.<br />The book is very well written and accessible, and recommended to anyone interested in art history or Scandinavia.  Five stars.	2003-09-10

Franz Kafka spent most of his life in Prague, even though he always felt like a stranger there -- a German-speaking Jew in a predominately Czech Catholic town.  Consequently, there are many sites in Prague that are of some interest to fans of Kafka's work.  Klaus Wagenbach's little \\"Travel Reader\\" highlights most of these sites (e.g., the writer's birthplace, all the Kafka family residences around Old Town Square, Kafka's apartment in the castle, etc.).  If you're headed to Prague, you could easily spend half a day retracing Kafka's footsteps with this guide.  The book includes a map and numerous photographs of the city as it appeared about 100 years ago so you can contrast today's Prague with the Prague Kafka new.  It also includes some short excerpts from Kafka's works, mostly vignettes like the haunting \\"An Imperial Edict\\", included next to the sections on the buildings where Kafka lived.<br />I lived in Prague myself for a month this summer and frequently took this book along with me on my evening jaunts through town.  The selections from the writer's work included here helped add personal and emotional meaning to what otherwise might have been just a bunch of buildings.  Highly recommended.	2003-07-15

Yet while pictures and attractive diagrams are important, there's a lot of other critical travel information you just won't find here.<br />The city maps in this guide are anything but detailed.  I challenge you to find your way around Agrigento in the dark, like I had to, with the map in this guide.  You need a detailed street map.<br />This book is also seriously lacking in information about how to get around by bus and train.  By contrast, Lonely Planet's guide to Sicily lists, under a special heading (\\"Getting There & Away\\"), the number of trains and buses that leave or arrive in a given city daily, how often, where to catch them, and what they cost.  There's also another section in the Lonely Planet guide, \\"Getting Around\\", which tells you which buses to take inside the cities, where to rent a car or a bike, and so forth.  DK's guide leaves you stranded.<br />The last major defect of this guide is its hotel and hostel recommendations: if you're a budget traveler or a student, this is definitely not the guide for you.  Its \\"Places to Stay\\" section is almost entirely limited to pricey 3-, 4-, and 5-star hotels:  it needs to list less expensive alternatives.  Excellent hostels like the Agora Youth Hostel in Catania aren't listed at all.  Furthermore, the authors could have put their hotels on the city maps, like Lonely Planet and Rough Guides.<br />DK's other regional guides are a little more functional than this one, but if you're headed to Sicily, take Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, or Let's Go along with you instead.  3 stars.	2002-05-07

Bernard Lewis writes in a silky-smooth, easy-to-read style, yet the book is erudite and not &quot;Middle Eastern history for dummies&quot;.<br />Lewis explores how the &quot;medieval iron curtain&quot; between Christendom and Islam gradually broke down (to the extent that it did) between the Crusades and the middle of the 19th century, underscoring the Muslim world's changing views of Europe. From Islam's early days up through the Ottoman zenith in the 16th century, Islamic civilization was unquestionably more brilliant than its European counterpart. So Muslims didn't find much reason to be interested in the West. While Europe's Roman forbears might be worth a glance, the average Middle Easterner's image of a European before 1800 was the one (perhaps mythic) symbolized by the filthy Austrian soldiers who, in a 17th-century assault on Budapest (then an Ottoman city), turned an immaculate Turkish bath-house into a horse stable and then washed themselves in their animals' urine. With some justification, Muslim scholars reasoned that Europe had no important ideas and no important literature: the most noteworthy European writer of the Middle Ages, after all, was St. Thomas Aquinas, whose books obviously didn't have anything interesting to say to Muslims. Consequently, for centuries, educated Muslims thought it was a waste of time to learn about Europe. As late as the 18th century, Ottoman officialdom was still referring to Europeans -- in government documents -- with nifty little derogatory jingles like &quot;Ingiliz dinsiz&quot; (Englishman without religion), &quot;Fransiz jansiz&quot; (soulless Frenchman), and &quot;Engurus menhus&quot; (inauspicious Hungarian), not to mention the standard and official use of the term &quot;infidel&quot; (kafr). In a way, though, their ignorance is surprising only in hindsight.<br />By 1800, all this had changed. Napoleon's Egyptian campaign (1798) initiated a new wave of European imperialism that over the 19th century, and for the first time since the Crusades, would establish Europeans in positions of direct or indirect power in significant parts of the Middle East. Muslims saw up-close how far Europeans had left them in the lurch: militarily, scientifically, politically, and economically. Rulers recognized that &quot;modernizing&quot; (that is, Europeanizing) their societies was imperative if they were going to prevent foreigners from eventually taking over (some did anyway). The 20th-century implications of these changes were huge: the struggle between tradition and Westernization was (and is) one of the keynotes of modern Middle East history.<br />Lewis ventures far beyond wars and politics and addresses every aspect of the subject: in fact, politics figures into very little of the book directly. Chapter 3, for example, is entirely about language and translation, examining what Muslims thought and knew about European languages and literature on the eve of their &quot;discovery&quot; of Europe. Other chapters explore what Muslims who traveled to Europe thought about this formerly bizarre and exotic destination and the impact made on Muslims by Europeans who traveled in the Middle East. There are also sections on the economy, the reception of European culture, religion, the military, etc.<br />Again, Lewis' style is extremely fluid and this is a book that everybody can enjoy.1800, all this had changed.

Yet today there are about 15 million Muslims in China, centered mostly in the northwest (Xinjiang province), along the margins of the old Silk Road.  And they aren't just an insignificant minority:  in the Middle Ages, for instance, Chinese Muslims played a central role in bridging the gulf between China, the Middle East, and Europe, bringing goods and knowledge both ways.  (...)<br />Jonathan Lipman's \\"Familiar Strangers\\" explores some aspects of Islam in northwestern China from the first arrival of Muslims there in the 8th century up through the 20th. Like most similar histories, it revolves around two major dilemmas that have constantly faced Chinese Muslims (as opposed to non-Chinese Muslims living in China):  first, is Islam compatible with Chinese culture? and second, can Chinese Muslims themselves properly be considered Chinese?  China's \\"host\\" culture has always tended to absorb alien peoples and faiths -- whether they're Mongols and Turks (the so-called \\"barbarians\\"), Buddhists from India, or whoever.  There were always strangers lurking at the gates of China, drooling with envy or burning with ambition, but almost every one of them who managed to break through eventually assimilated and became, in effect, Chinese: in fact, many sought to do so in the first place.  But Muslims were an exception.  Their Islamic faith forbade them to have the same kind of relationship with traditional Chinese culture as other groups:  for instance, ancestor worship and reverencing the emperor were antipathetic to Islam.  Consequently, Chinese Muslims were, while not complete strangers, \\"familiar strangers\\", ethnically Chinese, foreign by affiliation.<br />Lipman's history isn't a comprehensive account of Muslim culture on the northwestern Chinese frontier. Instead, it examines how Chinese Muslims reacted to the complexity of belonging to two cultures at once.  Lipman explores, for instance, Muslimreaction to acculturation policies under the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and Muslims' role as \\"strangers in bad times\\" during the Ming-Qing cataclysm in the 1640s.  Chapter 3, \\"Connections: Muslims in the Early Qing, 1644-1781\\", analyses the introduction of Naqshabandiya Sufism into China in the early 17th century and the struggle between two rival forms of it -- the orthodox Khafiya and the radical Jahriya -- in the 18th century, the latter a branch of revivalist Wahhabism, the earliest modern version of so-called Islamic \\"fundamentalism\\".  Chapter 4, \\"Strategies of Resistance,\\" explores the period between 1784 and 1895, looking at three large-scale Muslim rebellions against the Qing state.  Chapter 5 examines Muslim \\"Strategies of Integration\\" during the Nationalist period and under the People's Republic.  Finally, Lipman sums his findings in chapter 6.<br />The book is a scholarly read and not always easy going.  If you don't have much previous knowledge of Chinese history, start elsewhere.  But if you've got the background, it's a great read.	2001-11-04

For fifty years an inseparable mechanical friend traveled alongside him -- his portable Royal typewriter.  A gift from his mother, he took it all over the world and wrote all of his books and magazine articles on it.<br />Born in Alturas, California, in 1923, (a place that became a ghost town not long after), Laxalt was raised in Carson City, Nevada, the second son in a family of immigrant French Basques.  His father, Dominique, was a former livestock baron (a &quot;baron of sorts&quot;) who saw his flock of over 60,000 sheep and cattle wiped out by a ranch crash and a freeze in the early 1920s.  Consequently, he had to go back into the hills and build up his fortune again, slowly, living the hard life of a sheepherder, separated most of the year from his family.  Economic woes marked Laxalt's childhood.  He mentions how ashamed he was that his mother, who ran an otherwise respectable Basque boardinghouse, sold whiskey on the sly during Prohibition.  At school he was often taunted for being the son of a bootlegger.<br />Yet the family eventually got on its feet again, and after spending a year in the Belgian Congo during World War II, Laxalt graduated from the University of Nevada and began to forge a successful career in journalism.  His first book, &quot;Sweet Promised Land&quot; (1957), recounts his father Dominique's return to his birthplace in the Basque Country, St. Jean Pied-de-Port up in the French Pyrenees, fifty years after he left it, and the emotional recognition that his real home was not there, but in the hills of western Nevada.  In print for over forty years, &quot;Sweet Promised Land&quot; was Laxalt's most resounding success, even though he confesses in &quot;Travels with My Royal&quot; that it was torture to write.<br />Laxalt wrote 16 more books (fiction and non-fiction) before his death earlier this year, and was a regular contributor to National Geographic (he discusses his long love-hate relationship with that magazine in this book).  He also taught at the University of Nevada, was the director of its press, and helped found the Basque Studies Program there.  Anyone interested in the Basques will soon learn that Laxalt has done more than probably any other writer to help us understand their world.<br />If you're not already familiar with Laxalt's books, read a few first.  Here he talks about how works like &quot;Sweet Promised Land&quot; and &quot;In a Hundred Graves&quot; came about, and if you haven't read them, some of it will go over your head.	2001-10-05

In the 20th century, one of the most famous portrayals of Cossacks was in that early classic of Russian cinema, &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot;, in which a body of these perennial soldiers, dressed in the white jackets of the Tsar, gun down a crowd of civilians on a set of steps in Odessa (&quot;Cossack massacre on the steps&quot; in English works well as a pun).<br />A little-known aspect of Cossack history is explored in Claudio Magris' pseudo-novel, &quot;Inferences from a Sabre&quot; (1986). In June 1941, shortly after Hitler's invasion of Russia, German agents persuaded General Pyotr Krasnov, &quot;ataman&quot; (chieftain) of a band of Cossacks, to command a battalion of these fighters, famed for their aversion to communism. Krasnov, then 72 years old, was one of the most colorful figures of the 20th-century. As Neal Ascherson writes in his engrossing book, &quot;Black Sea&quot;, Krasnov's hatred of &quot;Bolshevism&quot; was matched &quot;only by his contempt for the Judaeo-democratic West.&quot; After joining the White Russian armies in the civil war, he fled to Paris, &quot;where, to the astonishment of this tough old soldier's friends, he became a prolific novelist.&quot; After World War II, so the story goes, Krasnov was betrayed by the English, handed over to Stalin, and hanged as a traitor.<br />Magris' &quot;novel&quot; takes the story up in October 1944. Hitler had promised the Cossacks a homeland in Carnia, that mountainous part of northeast Italy wedged between Venice, Austria, and Slovenia, and, the end of the war approaching, these exiles of the steppes were fighting it out with the Italian partisans. The book is a letter by Father Guido, a priest from Trieste, to one of his superiors.<br />In 1944 Guido was sent to interecede with the Cossacks and try to mitigate the cruelty meted out on the Carnians. While he was there, he thinks he met Krasnov, whose life and death intrigue him from then on. The crux of the book is the &quot;enigma woven around the death of Krasnov&quot;, an enigma that begins on 2 May 1945. As the Cossacks flee on horseback through the Val di Gorto to hide out in the forests of Austria, one of them is shot dead by the partisans. His companions bury him in a poorly marked grave and throw in a broken sabre. Father Guido explores the possibility that, contrary to the official story, this soldier was Krasnov.<br />Blurring the lines between fiction and reality, Magris plumbs the depths of Krasnov's character. Apart from the fact that Guido never existed, this lyrical &quot;novel&quot; would be an interesting work of speculation. Magris &quot;plays through the pathetic coda to Krasnov's life&quot;. We see the Cossack commander and his men as living contradictions, romantic figures (&quot;the flash of the blade in the air evoked for a moment the vague yearning glow of certain brief, blustery evenings, of curling sea-waves that seem to shine with the promise of everything we lack&quot;), medieval men, &quot;untamed and feudal&quot; who &quot;saw the revolution as the anonymous assault of modernity, the sunset of the individual, the end of adventure&quot;, yet also as anti-Semites, butchers, and the enemies of their own dream (&quot;the Cossacks reached that corner of the world [Carnia] to build themselves a house and to take shelter from the indeterminacy of nothingness, and instead they destroyed the hospitable order enclosed by these walls and delivered it back to formlessness.&quot;)<br />The novel is a great read, one of the best I've read this year. I also recommend Magris' depressing book, &quot;The Other Sea&quot;, about an Italian on the plains of Patagonia, plus Ascherson's book mentioned above.	2001-08-07

While Martin's text is occasionally a little tough to plod through (seven of the eight chapters are written in a journal format, which drags once in a while), his mesmerizing photographs make up for this minor shortcoming. The vivid photographs show us the breathtaking beauty of these still wild mountains, the beauty that has captivated and still captivates people as diverse as Fred Beckey (the legendary climber who claims hundreds of first ascents in the range) and Pulitzer Prize-winning Zen poet Gary Snyder (whom Martin once took a hike with).<br />Martin takes us up some of the major peaks, from gentle Ruth Mountain to gorgeous Mt. Shuksan and from massive Glacier Peak to the rugged ridges of the Pickets. In between, he devotes a chapter (the best in the book) to poets Kenneth Rexroth, Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and Allen Ginsburg (one of the only major Beat poets not to cultivate a life-long relationship with the Cascades).  There's also a chapter on mountain wildlife.<br />All in all a great book not to be missed.	2001-07-22

For the most part, the way we perceive them is still influenced by the time-honored and completely erroneous view that they more or less never strayed from their jobs as cooks and barbers, washer-women and baggage porters. Some of us are aware that there were two black cavalry regiments that fought in the Indian Wars (9th and 10th cavalry, the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;). But the belief persists that most of the West's other blacks lived in a world all their own and interacted with whites and others only in the context of racial violence or social subservience.<br />John W. Ravage radically reverses this image in &quot;Black Pioneers&quot;. By incorporating a phenomenally rich collection of photographs into his text, he visually documents the fact that African-Americans were not by any means confined to the peripheries of society. On the contrary, they engaged in a multitude of roles which ranged from the menial jobs stereotypically ascribed to them to the ownership of prosperous farms and ranches. They worked right alongside whites and seldom encountered the kind of incessant racial conflict long believed to have existed.  Additionally, they made many unique, significant contributions to western society and played a number of key roles.  For instance, mountain man Jim Beckwourth was a mulatto who explored and opened up significant portions of the Rocky Mountain West;  often portrayed as white (like John James Audubon, who was half-Haitian), he was once played by a white actor in a movie.  We also read about figures like James Douglas, the first colonial governor of British Columbia (sworn in in 1858), as well as groups of lesser-known blacks like whalers, policemen, loggers -- in short, men and women employed in the same kinds of work as whites.<br />Ravage also emphasizes the geographical diversity of the black experience in the West. He devotes separate chapters to the African-American presence on the Great Plains and in California, the Southwest, Washington and Oregon, western Canada, Alaska, and even Hawaii.  Plus, you'll find a chapter dedicated exclusively to African-American women.<br />The book would hardly have been possible without the documentation afforded by the photographs, since they are Ravage's primary source of information. They show us a world neglected by many and deliberately ignored by others, but that most of us (like myself) simply have had no clue existed.  They help give a &quot;new&quot; face to the West, a face that in fact was always there.	2001-07-16

The book is a poignant novel about Basque smugglers, set in the 1960s. In his recent book, &quot;The Land of My Fathers&quot;, Laxalt lamented the extinction of the &quot;contrabandiers&quot; (as they're known in France) when Spain entered the European Union, regretting that &quot;something of the romantic past has been lost&quot;.  In this slim and rapid-fire novel, though, Laxalt makes no bones about the ugly, desperate, and sometimes violent world of the &quot;romantic past&quot; of Basque smugglers.<br />The story revolves around Nikolas, an impoverished Basque with a wife and infant sons who, driven by financial despair and in spite of his wish to live a respectable life, takes on work as a &quot;contrabandier&quot; for Gregorio, the &quot;patrón&quot; of a small team of smugglers. As the narrator comments, Nikolas &quot;[breaks] the pattern in a land where patterns were not made to be broken. If your father was a cobbler, then it followed that you were a cobbler. If your father was a peasant, then you had better remain a peasant, too. If you were born poor, then it was your duty to remain poor.&quot; Gregorio argues him out of tradition, though, reminding Nikolas (correctly) that a man cannot feed and clothe his family with &quot;the substance of respectability&quot; and, besides, smuggling &quot;was not like stealing from a neighbor. The only victim was the government, and who had ever felt sorry for a government?&quot;<br />Gregorio arranges to have Nikolas lead a team of other smugglers (including Luis, Nikolas' brother-in-law) in an effort to smuggle fifty horses over the frontier straddling the ridge of the Pyrenees between France and Spain. If they are caught by the French border guards, they'll spend time in jail, which can mean ruin for a poor man. Worse, if theystruggle with the guards, it can mean death on the mountain.<br />Does the novel end in tragedy or does the team successfully make it over? Laxalt doesn't drop hints beforehand.  Neither will I. However it ends, &quot;A Cup of Tea in Pamplona&quot; is a weighty indictment of the grinding poverty that led Basques into smuggling. It offers a good glimpse into social conditions in the Basque Country, and though it isn't an &quot;ethnic&quot; novel or &quot;quaint&quot; in any way, you'll come away knowing something about customs and social relations in the Basque Country forty years ago. Additionally, Laxalt has an ear for terse narration and realistic dialogue free of clichés, plus the ability to weave a intense, continually engrossing plot. <br />I'm thinking about travelling in the Pyrenees next spring and found this book a great way to get a feel for the place. And having read Laxalt before, I can also say that I'll definitely read him again. A+ and 5 stars.	2001-07-13
US	52451731	R2M8R91YKHN5J6	0385269382	438440749	Time and the Place	Books	5	11	11	N	N	The many faces of old Cairo	Egypt's Naguib Mahfouz was the great chronicler of Cairo's dark alleyways and murky souls.  Born in 1911, he was educated in philosophy at the University of Cairo and spent most of his life as a civil servant .  While he seldom travelled abroad, he was strongly inlfuenced by the likes of men like Proust, Balzac, Dickens, and Camus.  He won the Nobel Prize in 1988.<br />&quot;The Time and the Place and Other Stories&quot; is a great place to begin if you've never read anything by Mahfouz and a welcome slice of his short fiction if you're only familiar with his novels.  One is struck by the variety of the stories collected here.  Written between 1962 and 1989, they incapsulate Mahfouz's concern with everything from political injustice to the downfall of families to loneliness and death and the anguished world-weariness that merges gradually, in many characters, into mysticism.<br />The Borgesean &quot;The Man and the Other Man&quot; (even the title is Borgesean) is a dark political allegory about a murderer stalking his victim;  at the end, though, he finds himself woven into a labyrinthine nightmare of his own creation.  In contrast to this tale's surrealism, &quot;The Answer is No&quot; is a realistic, outspokenly &quot;feminist&quot; tale about a resolute young woman who scorns the advances of an old tutor of hers and seeks to avoid love in order to devote her life to teaching, &quot;persuading herself that happiness is not confined to love and motherhood.  Never has she regretted her firm decision.&quot;  Side by side with these are stories like the title-piece, a semi-fantastic tale about a man who digs up an ancient parchment in his garden which leads him, in a bizarre (but, in retrospect, hilarious) ending, into trouble with the law, and &quot;The Empty Café&quot;, about an old teacher &quot;cursed by a long life&quot; who has seen all his friends and now his wife die and is left, at last, alone, shipwrecked at the end of his days in an age that is not his.  Alongside these are the folktale-ish &quot;The Conjurer Made Off With the Dish&quot; and the mystical &quot;Zaabalawi&quot;, Mahfouz's most famous story, about a man hunting for an elusive healer-sheikh.<br />I thought a few of the stories were a flop (for instance, &quot;The Tavern of the Black Cat&quot;, in which a man walks into a café and, for no reason I could catch, refuses to let anyone leave;  the jumbled up ending left me with the impression that Mahfouz just couldn't pull it off.)  Otherwise, there's no reason why this book should be out of print.  It's worth finding.  5 stars.	2001-07-12

Influenced by the Romantic conception of folk culture as the repository of national identity, Lönnrot spent years studying and recording the ancient Finnish oral epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, which he published in 1835 in a famous edition and revised over the next fifteen years.  In 1840-41 he followed this up with the publication of a companion work, the &quot;Kanteletar&quot;, a collection of lyrics and ballads also drawn from the Finnish oral tradition.  Meaning literally &quot;zither-daughter&quot;, the &quot;Kanteletar&quot; is made up of poems originally sung over the zither by a bard (or 'laulaja' in Finnish).  Although the book is hardly known outside Finland, Keith Bosley's translation for Oxford World's Classics is excellent and the first one in English.<br />As Bosley points out, the Finnish lyric tradition is one of the oldest still extant.  Most Finnish folksongs sung today are so-called &quot;later songs&quot; (that is, both the lyrics and the tunes came to Finland since the start of the Middle Ages, mostly from Sweden).  Yet what is unique about the lyrics and ballads of the &quot;Kanteletar&quot; is that they date from a much earlier period.  These poems are part of the so-called &quot;Kalevala&quot; tradition brought by the Finns from their home in Central Asia well over a thousand years ago and that survived the longest in eastern Finland (where Lönnrot worked) and the Russian borderlands.  Sung to simpler, usually five-note tunes, the &quot;Kanteletar&quot; lyrics also had a rythym all their own.<br />Most of the &quot;Kanteletar&quot; poems are very somber and sing of love spurned or the woes of life.  But others are surprisingly comic, like &quot;The Origin of Beer&quot; or &quot;Spinster&quot;.  &quot;Churchgoers&quot; is worth quoting in full:<br />&quot;A tip-tap of shoes / a clip-clop of leather shoes: / the girls are coming to church / twinkling to the gallery. / They tear open their bosom / they wrench out their books / from which they intone a hymn / and read beautiful verses. / A clatter of clogs / a rattle of birchbark shoes: / the boys are coming to church / rowdily up the church hill / flasks of booze beneath their coats / jugs of beer under their arms. / The book is not in their minds / nor are the priest's best sermons: / in their minds the girls lie down / in their hearts they kindle fire.&quot;  (I apologize for my ignorance of HTML!).<br />The ballads at the end of the book have interested scholars more than the lyrics, above all the &quot;Ballad of the Virgin Mary,&quot; a ballad from the Orthodox eastern Finns, and the grim &quot;Elina&quot;, the tale of a jealous husband who burns his wife to death.<br />In short, this a great way to get to know Finnish folk literature.  If you enjoyed the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, you'll love the &quot;Kanteletar&quot;.	2001-07-05
US	52451731	RI24IELDMMWYD	0874173167	501173807	A Book of the Basques (Basque Series)	Books	5	35	35	N	N	A classic destined to remain one	I usually don't review books that have already been reviewed, but I think the customer below severely misjudged this book.    First of all, the reason why it doesn't go much beyond 1930 is because that's when it was published.  British folklorist Rodney Gallop was a pioneer in the field of Basque anthropology and \\"A Book of the Basques\\" was one of the earliest (and remains one of the most readable) attempts to explain Basque culture to the English-speaking world.      Gallop inclined heavily toward the French side of the Pyrénées for two reasons.  First, that's where he did most of his research.  Second, as he points out in the book, the French Basque Country -- at least up to the time he wrote -- had always been much less heavily industrialized than its Spanish counterpart, making it much more ideal for an anthropologist's study.  The ancient traditions of the Basques survived more intact in France and, additionally, the French Basques were more culturally \\"introspective\\" than their Spanish cousins;  that is, they never played as prominent a part in the national life of France as did the Spanish Basques in Spain and its empire.  Consequently, they remained much closer to their \\"roots\\", so to speak.    Unlike the reviewer below, I thought the book was extremely well written and a fantastic source of information on traditional Basque folklife.  Gallop does quote a lot from French, but he wrote in a time when you weren't considered educated until you knew a little French. The book is divided into chapters on such aspects of Basque folklife as language and literature, folksongs, folkdance, proverbs, Basque houses, superstition and witchcraft, fishermen and corsairs (!), decoration, and that great game, \\"pelote\\".  Additionally, the author discusses some of the many theories regarding the mysterious origins of the Basques, which, admittedly, is of less interest today than it was in 1930 (the Golden Age of bogus racial theories!).    Unfortunately, much of the book hasto be shifted into the past tense today, since the traditional Basque folkways Gallop describes have grown more and more obsolete since he wrote.  But as work of history, it's still a classic and is destined to remain one.  A+	2001-06-30

Consequently, much of this has not been republished.  &quot;Marking the Sparrow's Fall&quot; is a new anthology edited by Stegner's son, Page, and a great introduction to all of his work.  Uniquely, though, most of it is an unearthing of previously uncollected non-fiction.<br />Stegner himself referred to these pieces as &quot;junk&quot; that he wrote to buy the groceries with, but I think we would all be hard-pressed to agree with him.  His son comments in the preface that most of this writing remained uncollected simply because Stegner -- a tremendously busy man -- forgot about it.  &quot;None of it qualifies as 'grocery-buying junk'&quot;, Page notes, &quot;... certainly not the humor of 'Why I Like the West,' wherein he insists that as a wild man from the West 'I have always done my best to live up to what tradition says I should be.  I have always tried to look like Gary Cooper and talk like the Virginian.  I have endeavored to be morally upright, courteous to women;  with an innate sense of right and wrong but without the polish that Yale College or European travel might have put upon me.  I have consented to be forgiven my frontier gaucheries, and I did not hold it against the waiter in the Parker House bar when he removed my feet from the upholstery.&quot;<br />So here you'll find a handful of Stegner's better-known non-fiction -- two abridged chapters from &quot;Wolf Willow&quot;, the &quot;Wilderness Letter&quot;, and some other essays -- plus his famous short-story, &quot;Genesis&quot;, the tale of an Englishman on the Saskatchewan frontier during the winter of 1906.  But most of the book is made up of otherwise hard-to-find material, like his sketch, &quot;Xanadu By the Salt Flats,&quot; the recollection of a summer he spent when he was fifteenflipping hot dogs at Saltair, an amusement park on the shores of Great Salt Lake.<br />Throughout the book, one is captivated by Stegner's incredible power to evoke the people and landscape and unfinished wars of the American West, a power that made him a pillar of the budding environmental movement in the 1950s and in the years up to his death in 1994.  Personally, I found some of his conservation pieces in the middle of the book to be less interesting than his autobiographical sketches and fiction -- as I think anyone would -- but no Stegner anthology would be complete without them.<br />If you've never read Stegner, I guarantee you'll love this anthology.  If you have read Stegner, this is a great way to get to know some of his lesser-known short pieces.  A+ and five stars.	2001-06-30

Extremely well-written and accessible to the general reader, it recognizes that great art was created in a social and historical context and explains that context.  This approach not only allows us to understand the arts more fully in their own right, but also to use them in studying Spanish history.<br />Moffitt starts with Spain's fascinating pre-historic art and moves up through the Roman, Islamic, Romanesque, Gothic, and Golden Age periods straight through to the 20th century.  Like most studies, he races through the 18th and 19th centuries, but the quality of his remarks makes up for his brevity.  As the title indicates, he briefly discusses architecture, sculpture, and the decorative arts as well as painting.  This approach puts painting in a broad aesthetic context as well as an historical one.<br />Additionally, the illustrations are excellent and mostly in color.<br />I already knew something about Spanish art when I picked up this book, but I felt I learned a lot.  If you know absolutely nothing about Spanish art and haven't had much luck with art history books in the past, this is definitely the place to begin.	2001-06-24

Although they were published in England almost forty years ago, they still sound remarkably fresh and will be in print for many years to come.<br />In &quot;A Doll's House&quot; (1879), Ibsen casts us into the world of Nora Helmer, a young Norwegian housewife and Nordic Madame Bovary.  Highlighting the restricted position of women in male-dominated society, the play sparked such an uproar in Scandinavia when it appeared that &quot;many a social invitation during that winter bore the words: 'You are requested not to mention Ibsen's Doll's House!'&quot;  In fact, Hedwig Niemann-Raabe, the actress who was to play Nora on tour in Germany, was so appalled at the ending of this play -- at this female &quot;monster&quot; -- that she demanded Ibsen write an alternative one in German, which he did (a &quot;barbaric outrage&quot;, in his words).  McFarlane has appended this German-language ending (and a translation in English).<br />Based on the theme, &quot;The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children,&quot; &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1881) is one of Ibsen's most riveting plays.  Like &quot;A Doll's House&quot;, it, too, was denounced on its début (&quot;crapulous stuff&quot;, &quot;an open drain&quot;, one London reviewer called it -- certainly a Victorian exaggeration).  As in most of his plays, Ibsen probes the hypocrisies of patriarchal society, which he deems to be rotten at its core, and stultifying provincial life (&quot;Doesn't the sun ever shine here?&quot;).  Typically, he also casts women in a favorable light.<br />&quot;A Doll's House&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot; established Ibsen's reputation as one of the finest playwrights in Europe, but his next two plays -- &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1890) and &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (1892) -- gave him undisputed international fame.  As McFarlane points out, the 1890s &quot;were the years when the publication of a new Ibsen play sent profound cultural reverberations throughout Europe and the world.&quot;  &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; marks Ibsen's shift away from highly controversial dramas primarily concerned with social and sexual injustice to &quot;domestic&quot; plays that addressed the struggle of individuals to control each other, people who &quot;want to control the world, but cannot control [themselves].&quot;  &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; is a thoroughly electrifying drama about a married woman's devouring sense of decay and confinement.  &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, which Ibsen coupled with &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, is his riveting look into sexual potency and the domination of youth by age.<br />These plays are not as dark and dirty as they might seem.  Whatever reviewers may have said about them when they came out and whatever gloomy stuff psychiatrists have written about them since, if you're at all familiar with prime-time television, they won't offend you -- in fact, you probably wont even lift an eyebrow.  Still, I found myself glued to them for hours and I've read them before.  Find a copy for your shelf!	2001-06-21

Collected between 1900 and 1956 by José Miguel de Barandiarán, the Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm of the Basque Country, they were published in Spanish translation in 1988. The stories are arranged into three sections: witty animal fables, tales about humans and witches, and &quot;legends&quot; that explain the origins of Basque folk-beliefs. As Barandiarán points out in his introduction, while these tales only form part of the &quot;peripheral vision&quot; of today's Basques, they encapsulate a lot of the ancient Basque folklife. Elements of the &quot;old wisdom&quot; have co-existed with Christianity for hundreds of years and allow us both to glimpse some of the Basque Country's unrecorded history and &quot;piece together the spiritual physiognomy&quot; of the ancient and early-modern Basques.<br />The book's English title and the previous customer review, though, are misleading. First, this is not entirely a book about witchcraft. Witches figure prominently in many of the stories, but the original Spanish title -- &quot;Brief Anthology of Fables, Stories, and Legends from the Basque Country&quot; -- was more accurate. Second, the subtitle, &quot;Folktales of the Pyrenees&quot;, is also misleading. These tales come only from the Basque Country, not from Catalonia.<br />Still, it's a great anthology. The English translation by Linda White is expert. If you're interested in finding the tales in Spanish, check out the original version of the book (Editorial Txertoa, San Sebastián, 1988) or the excellent 12-volume series, &quot;Cuentos y leyendas de la Euskal Herria fantástica&quot; edited by José Dueso (ROGER, Donostia, 1998) in which many of the stories are reprinted almost verbatim.	2001-06-16

In 1930, she met the British writer, Gerald Brenan, married him, and moved to his home in Churriana, in southern Spain.  Although both Brenan and Woolsey sought to be remembered foremost as poets, today they are far better known for their prose works -- Brenan, especially, is recognized as one of the great Hispanists of the 20th century.<br />Woolsey's remarkable book, &quot;Death's Other Kingdom&quot; (1938?), is far less known than her husband's writings, but for no good reason.  Fortunately, it has now been edited, given a new title (&quot;Malaga Burning&quot;), and made available for the first time in the United States by Brenan's one-time neighbor Zalin Grant, who rightly acclaimed it one of the best memoirs of the Spanish Civil War.  Grant has also happily removed the mysogynistic preface by Woolsey's brother-in-law that appeared in the British edition.<br />&quot;Malaga Burning&quot; is Woolsey's eyewitnees account of the first seven weeks of the war in Málaga and its outskirts.  Among Civil War memoirs it is unique, for it is one of only a handful written by women and, in addition, it moves beyond the &quot;great events&quot; of the war and the experiences of foreigners, to focus, instead, on the agony of ordinary Spaniards of all classes and political persuasions.  Sandra Mardenfeld criticised the book for this in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, saying that Woolsey &quot;provides little education about the war; rather her story captures the cruelties of humankind without offering much context.&quot;  Ironically, the author would agree 100%.<br />Woolsey is decidedly apolitical.  She portrays all groups -- anarchists, communists, fascists, even refugee Englishwomen sipping tea in Gibraltar -- as equally inclined to ferocity and (with the exception of the latter group!) brutal murder.  One of the central parts of the book narrates her struggle to help a Málaga businessman escape death at the hands of the anarchists.  Yet Woolsey is not inclined to sympathize with the fascists -- at night, she can see the smoke and flames rising from Málaga from her home several miles off, nationalist bombs bursting over civilians' heads, shattering their world to ruins.  She is also critical of the many journalists who flocked to Spain to scoop up stories about &quot;anarchist atrocities&quot; and the &quot;Red terror&quot;.  In fact, she coined the term &quot;pornography of violence&quot;, noting how effete Englishmen and anti-communists seemed to enjoy reading horror stories about raped nuns and wealthy families burned alive in their homes, stories often made up to satisfy this very lust for exploiting other people's nightmares.<br />Obviously, the book isn't a &quot;pleasant&quot; read, but it's an incredibly important one.  Woolsey's vivid writing makes for emotionally engaging, profoundly stirring book that no one who is interested in Spanish or European history should miss.  5 stars.	2001-06-14

Laxalt -- the son of Basques who immigrated to Nevada about 1910 -- spent 1960-61 and 1965-66 getting to know his parents' ancient homeland. Making use of his family ties, he succeeded in breaching the &quot;impenetrable wall of Basque reserve&quot; (in Rodney Gallop's words) in a way only a few outsiders have been able to do.<br />The book is not a straightforward narrative and Laxalt writes about much more than his own experiences. A collection of vignettes, histories, and folk-sayings, it is an exploration of the Basque character. We read about everything from &quot;Basque troubadours&quot; to the humanization of German soldiers stationed in the Basque lands during the occupation of the Pyrenees. Trying to capture the essence of this ancient people, Laxalt gives us glimpses of the &quot;poetic truth&quot; of the Basque land and Basque history, the emotional truth gleaned from &quot;the language of the eyes.&quot; Of course the approach is not without its drawbacks, but for a book like this, &quot;The Land of My Fathers&quot; is remarkably free of immigrant-son's-come-home romanticism.<br />In addition to Laxalt's vivid prose poetry, many of his vignettes are interesting as anthropological descriptions of life in the &quot;Pays Basque&quot;. Here, we encounter aspects of Basque folklife such as pigeon-hunting, contraband, dancing, the unique brand of &quot;shepherd justice&quot;, and the &quot;bohèmes&quot; (literally &quot;Bohemians&quot;, they are a poorly-known group of shunned outsiders -- not unlike the Gypsies -- who have lived in the Basque country for years). A couple of these &quot;ethnological vignettes&quot;, in fact, appeared in the August 1968 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot;.<br />Although throughout one is struck by the Basques' indomitable ability to overcome adversity, unfortunately the beautiful culture described by Laxalt is rapidly slipping away -- if it has not, for the most part, slipped away already. The Spanish sector of the Basque lands has long been one of the most heavily industrialized in Europe and the French sector, although still largely rural, has seen the same kinds of cultural changes places all over the world have seen with the onslaught of globalization. Many things have changed for the better, and Laxalt certainly doesn't claim the past was perfect, yet it is difficult not to agree with him that &quot;something of the romantic past has been lost.&quot; For all that, his many books are even more important, small safeguards against a rapidly deteriorating humanity.<br />If there were ten stars, &quot;The Land of My Fathers&quot; deserves them.	2001-06-02

As a portrait of Barcelona, the novel reveals it for what it is -- at once one of the most exciting cities in Europe and a postmodernist pigsty.  A hilarious satire on contemporary art, aging hippies, preparations for the Olympics. philosophy, books, gay bars, and even mystery novels themselves, &quot;An Olympic Death&quot; is Manuel Vázquez Montalbán at his best.<br />The novel's opening scene could have been taken straight from a Peter Sellers movie.  Claire Delmas, a eye-boggling French beauty, and her friend the Olympic agent Georges Lebrun, pay a visit to Pepe Carvalho, Barcelona's aging private-eye, gastronome extraordinaire, and repentent Communist.  Carvalho (pronounced &quot;car-valyu&quot;) is truly an unorthodox figure among private-eyes.  Immediately, it is evident that he is much more of a psychiatrist than a private-eye, braving the dangers of his clients' conversation instead of the world of crime.  Claire and Lebrun are looking for Alekos, Claire's renegade Greek husband turned homosexual.  Their search for him -- chaperoned by Carvalho -- leads them through a motley of comic scenes in Barcelona.<br />Perhaps uniquely among detective novels, Carvalho is simultaneously at work on a curious, entirely unrelated second &quot;case&quot;.  Luis Brando, a wealthy publisher (no relation to Marlon), engages him to keep an eye on Beba, his nymphomaniac teenage daughter.  Beba is a lusty lass with a penchant for screwing old men.  Carried out alongside the search for Alekos, Beba's case leads Carvalho through a riotous labyrinth of crazy characters and a hilarious tour of Barcelona by night.<br />While I enjoyed the novel immensely and I understand it's largely a satire on &quot;cultural hooliganism&quot; (Carvalho's phrase), I have to admit that there are some trashy scenes.  Montalbán could have excluded them and not damaged his story.  I'm not a prude, but from time to time he overkilled the sex and profanity.  So much so that to be frank, I was ready for the novel to end.<br />Nevertheless, the book was a fantastic read and I'm eager to find more Montalbán.  5 stars.	2001-05-28

Although Allard spoke no Basque and was linked to the Basque country only through his Basque wife, his stunning photos evoke the tremendous power of the Basque landscape and people:  the haunting flanks of the Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es-Atlantiques at evening; the gloomy mountains of the northern coast of Spain just at the approach of a storm; a rough-hewn woman with a scythe at Behorleguy, on the frontier between youth and age, in whose face is reflected the painful past of the ancient Basque people.  From a technical point-of-view, these incredible photographs are so good that they could truly be &quot;images of yesterday&quot;: the color is brilliant.  Alas, though, &quot;yesterday&quot; in the Basque country is no more.  The years since 1967 have seen the heavy industrialization of both the French and Spanish sectors of the Basque homeland and the gradual passing of the ancient ways Allard captures here.<br />Laxalt's contribution to this book is his prose vignettes, some of the best of his characteristically exquisite prose-poetry.  A second-generation Basque-American whose father grew up in the French Basque country, Laxalt knows the region as well as probably anyone in the United States.  While one cannot miss the heavy dose of romanticism in his prose (&quot;Girls slender as reeds walking hand in hand down the lane, singing an ode to spring in soprano voices pure and light as air&quot;) and even pastoralism (exacerbated by the fact that the Basques are some of the world's greatest shepherds), it is obvious that Laxalt is a remarkable writer.<br />A poetic look at &quot;yesterday&quot; in the Basque country.

Although rather short, &quot;Moroccan Style&quot; is full of some of the most stunning photographs I've ever seen of North African homes.  The colors just jump out at you.  In addition, it covers a pretty broad spectrum of upper-crust Moroccan home interiors, ranging from traditional Islamic styles to the fascinating contemporary blend of Muslim and Western.  Separate chapters show us a sample of exteriors, interiors, furniture, weavings, and tiles.  While the book IS a little short on text, so what?  What is there to say about a couch anyway, especially when there's a picture of it right in front of you?<br />I might mention two things about the book, though.  First, it focuses overwhelmingly on interior DESIGN, not exterior ARCHITECTURE.  The single chapter on Moroccan exteriors is very interesting, but skimpy.  Second, you won't find anything at all about the less affluent sectors of Morocco here.  The author has stuck entirely to the classy villas on the coast.  That's not necessarily bad, but I think she could have broadened her look at Morocco's intriguing architecture by covering some of its less ritzy homes, as well as mosques and government buildings.  But in any case, a very nice book for what it is.	2001-05-07

You might take a look at it before reading my review, which is intended as a corrective.<br />Bartolomé de Las Casas, born in 1474, came to Cuba with Diego Velázquez's expedition in 1511 as a soldier.  In Cuba, he became an &quot;encomendero&quot;, receiving Indian labor parcelled out to the conquistadors.  The horrors of the conquest of the Caribbean sparked a religious conversion in him and he became a Dominican friar in 1515.  Soon, he made his way to the Central American mainland, where he started missionary work among the Maya in Guatemala.  Dubbed later &quot;The Apostle to the Indians&quot; for his work on their behalf, he was eventually appointed Bishop of Chiapas.  An intimate friend of the Indians, fluent in their languages, Las Casas witnessed Spanish cruelties perpetrated against them between the very year of his arrival and some years before his death in Spain in 1566.<br />In 1552, Las Casas published his empassioned &quot;Short Account&quot; (actually written 13 years earlier), in which he laid bare Spanish cruelties in America.  Though generally condemned as slander in Spain, the book rapidly became popular in the rest of Europe, where it served to fuel anti-Spanish hate.  Spain's enemies used it to depict Spaniards as evil tyrants and to rationalize carving out their own empires in the Americas.  New editions appeared repeatedly, even as late as 1898, during the Spanish-American War.<br />Few credible historians take the &quot;Account&quot; for gospel truth.  Much of what Las Casas says is certainly true.  And while the rest is exaggerated, it is not &quot;propaganda&quot;.  Whatever truth the narrative has, though, what I think many people miss when they read it is its importance in understanding the Spanish Black Legend.<br />The Black Legend is the perception of Spain as a uniquely cruel and bigoted nation in excess of reality.  Spanish culture is boiled down to the Inquisition and the bullfight.  Spain's authors are ignored.  The Spanish did nothing in the Americas but kill millions of Indians.  This is the legacy of the 16th century.  The substance of many European attitudes toward Spain up to about 1950 can be traced right to Las Casas' &quot;Account.&quot;  Appearing at the time when England and the Netherlands were emerging as major powers, grappling with Spain, the imagery from the book was woven right into their national mythologies.  Because of historical circumstance, other nations that committed atrocities far worse than Spain's -- France, Britain, the United States -- never had to undergo the same humiliating scrutiny, the same alienation.  Las Casas's book, certainly agaist its author's will, helped shape this.<br />There are more reliable accounts of the &quot;destruction of the West Indies&quot;, including some by Las Casas.  The account's real value is the key it offers to understanding Western perceptions of Spain.  Like so many anti-Spanish documents of its time, the book, in the end, can tell us as much about the fascinating figure of its author and the character of Spain's enemies as about the horrors of the conquest and the nation it vilifies.	2001-04-25
US	52451731	R1GIH91LVJIHTM	0817303553	565797187	The North American Sketches of R. B. Cunninghame Graham	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Savagery and humanity in the Texas-Mexico borderlands	R.B. Cunninghame Graham's books are the sort of non-fiction that can almost be passed off as fiction.   Desolate but fascinating wastelands, journeys over the silent terrain of the Americas, encounters with the bare edges of existence -- all make his works so engaging that I can't think of any writers to compare with him except his friends Joseph Conrad and W.H. Hudson.<br />Culled from his thirty or more books, Graham's &quot;North American Sketches&quot; were written between 1880 and 1925.  They form the companion volume to his stunning South American and Scottish sketches also edited by John Walker.  Here, we travel with the eccentric Scottish gaucho and radical MP for Menteith to the Mexican frontier and the Texas borderlands.<br />It is a savage world oscillating between barbarity and loneliness Graham describes for us.  Time is punctuated with bloodshed, pointless cruelty, man's inhumanity to man, but also with hope and awe of this still wild land. &quot;A Hegira,&quot; perhaps the most powerful sketch, depicts Graham's repeated encounters with six fugitive Mexican Apaches escaping from &quot;the law&quot; as he and his wife head north from Mexico City to their San Antonio ranch.  &quot;Silent and stoical the warriors sat,&quot; he describes them in the first encounter, before their flight, &quot;not speaking once in a whole day, communicating but by signs; naked except the breech-clout; their eyes apparently opaque, and looking at you without sight, but seeing everything.&quot;  These figures from two worlds meet up again.  &quot;Days followed days as in a ship at sea; the waggons rolling on across the plains&quot; as Graham's party continually spies traces of the Apaches fleeing to their homes in the north, pursued by Mexican Indian hunters who, over a week, track down and kill them all.  Nothing during his journey inspires in him so much fascination as those &quot;stoical,&quot; silent &quot;indios bravos&quot;:  &quot;I wondered what they thought, how theylooked upon the world.&quot;<br />There is in these sketches a profound sense of disenchantment with civilization as practised, with &quot;progress&quot; as conceived.  The American and Mexican public, he writes, doubtless believe in the problematical &quot;Uncle Sam's Justice [sic],&quot; the &quot;poetical justice&quot; of slaughtering Indians.  Nevertheless, Graham does not completely scorn &quot;civilization&quot;; far from it.  &quot;We might have taught [the Indians] something, they might have taught us much, but soon they will all be forgotten, and the lying telegrams will speak of 'glorious victories by our troops.' &quot;  Some sketches, in fact, exhibit Graham's great admiration for the Anglo and Mexican societies he in other places condemns.  &quot;A Chihuahueño&quot; is a wonderful portrait of Miguel Sáenz, a mestizo from Chihuahua.  Full of Sáenz's witty proverbs, the sketch shows Graham's fascination with folk sayings.  &quot;Trust not a mule nor a wench&quot;, Sáenz quips; and &quot;Among soldiers and prostitutes all compliments stand excused.&quot;<br />Graham's portraits of Mexico and Texas are every bit as fascinating as his awesome South American Sketches.  If you like W.H. Hudson and Joseph Conrad, you'll love R.B. Cunninghame Graham.	2001-04-10
