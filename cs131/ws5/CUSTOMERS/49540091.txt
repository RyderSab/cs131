In the first he recounts the history of English domination in Ireland focusing especially on the basis for the economic disparities between the landed gentry in Ireland and the majority of the native Irish -- disparities that were in existance for centuries and only began to fade away during the latter half of the 20th century.<br /><br />From here he does a fairly good job of recounting the events and history of the potato blight itself and the horrors that were created by the failure of the potato crop and the inaction and lack of response of the British authorities to do anything about it.<br /><br />In these first two parts of the book, Gallagher sets forth an approachable and fairly good recounting of the events of this period.  Although relying heavily on other secondary sources, this is a reliable summary of this period, especially for someone unfamiliar with Irish history, especially the history of this dark period in Ireland.<br /><br />However, in the third part of the book Gallagher strays greatly from \\"history\\" and delves into something more along the lines of historical fiction, and bad historical fiction at that.  In this final part of the book, Gallagher reconstructs events that occurred on many of the immigrant ships taking Irish fleeing from starvation to new opportunities in America.  In doing this, he uses the device of following three immigrants who met on the boat and detailing their story from Ireland to the ship itself and then following them as they settle in New York.  He essentially makes up the events, conversations and situations that these three encounter.<br /><br />The devices used by the author in the final part of this book detract greatly from the book as a whole.  The worst part about this final chapter is how greatly it strays from the format of the rest of the book.  It is as if the author ran out of research material and just relied on his imagination to fill out the rest of the book.<br /><br />That being said, the book on whole is not bad.  I would recommend it for readers who have a passing interest in this period in Irish history and want an overview of the awful events of this time.  For those looking for a more complete and encompassing history, check out Cecil Woodham-Smith's \\"The Great Hunger\\".	2005-09-28

In addition to slap your knees funny accounts such as when Larry and his uncle, a Catholic priest, venture into Northern Ireland with the purpose of converting the Rev. Ian Paisley, there are also very moving accounts of friends and relationships that have been lost.  His accounts of witnessing the events of September 11 first hand will bring tears to the eyes of even the most jaded reader. <br /> <br />This book is of course a must for any Black 47 fan, as it provides deep insight into many favorite Black 47 songs.  However, even for a casual fan or anyone who is interested in the music business, as it were, Green Suede Shoes provides an unique persepctive into the every day life of a rock and roll veteran, and done with much more sensitivity and lyricism than most run of the mill rock biographies you will find.	2005-03-15

Where other societies owe great changes to political leaders, scientists, or philosophers the West was changed completely both culturally and politically by the Fab Four from Liverpool, England.  No work of fiction or non-fiction brings this truth more to light than Larry Kirwan's wildly entertaining novel \\"Liverpool Fantasy.\\"<br />The story is set in 1987, twenty-five years after the Beatles broke-up prior to the release of their groundbreaking single \\"Please Please Me.\\"  The four, never achieving their \\"fab\\" status, have taken different paths following the break-up: Paul the Vegas lounge superstar, John the local town [clown], Ringo still backing bands in his native Liverpool and George the Catholic priest recovering from a nervous breakdown.<BR>We follow the four as they get back together for the first time in twenty-five years.<br />Kirwan's vivid language and descriptions bring the story alive.  The excitement I felt when \\"seeing\\" the Beatles perform on stage (in 1987 no less!) was palpable.  The story is at once humorous and heart-breaking while all the while making the reader anxious to turn the next page.<br />As thought provoking as it is entertaining, Kirwan delves into all of the possibilities of this \\"what if\\" alternate world politically, socially, and culturally.  Throughout this sort of magical mystery tour, we come to a new understanding of these four individuals' personas, and a deeper appreciation of just how much of an impact The Beatles have had on everything since.	2003-05-27

A quick study of the book, however, shows that it presents a mere overview of approximately five years of Irish history, that being the time of the Easter Uprising in 1916 to the time of the Anglo-Irish treaty in 1921.  There it ends.<br />Certainly one looking to learn more on the history of the relationship between Irleand and the UK would expect more from a study of Anglo-Irish relations.  This is a woefully incomplete book.<br />Anyone interested in learning more about the history of the relationship between Britain and Ireland can find many widely available histories which do a much better job than this book.  Furthermore, the book fails to offer much insight into the period in which it covers.  If you are interested in this period of Irish history, between 1916-1921, pick up &quot;The Easter Rebellion,&quot; by Max Caufield, &quot;Rebels,&quot; by Peter deRosa, and the biographies of Michael Collins and Eamon deValera by Tim Pat Coogan for greater insight on this important era of Irish history.	2003-01-10

This proves to be the most complete as well as the most enjoyable read.  Haverty does an admirable job of tracing Constance's life from her sheltered childhood on the Co. Sligo estate of her Anglo-Irish family, to her years in the Arts Salons of Paris, to her conversion to a revolutionary leading the charge of Irish Republicanism and Labour.  The imagery and language of this book, will make this a treat for the reader.  Quite informative and well researched, I highly recommend this book.	2002-11-20

The book's fails somewhat in that it throws feminist theory and a late-1960s spin in to the mix, and the result is that it detracts from the fascinating story of Constance's life.  If you are interested in the life of this remarkable woman, this book is not bad, especially if you read it in conjunction with the other fine biographies available.  However, if you are looking to read one book on Contance's life, Anne Haverty's fine biography as well as Constance's own prison letters would be better sources.	2002-11-20

Her vivid style and talent with words continues the legend she brought back to life with her previous novel.  The battle in which Donough, his troops battle-ravaged and starving, face their enemies as hundreds of CuChullains will bring chills to your spine as you read.

The reader will be spell bound by many of the accounts such as Cathal Brugha's one-man stand against a batallion of British soldiers, and the heart-wrenching final account of the hours leading up to James Connolly's execution having to be tied to a chair due to the severity of his wounds.
