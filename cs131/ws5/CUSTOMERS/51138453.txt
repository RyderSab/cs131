I heard great things about it and could not wait to read it. The writing was excellent, and the premise was pretty clever. However, about halfway through, the story started to wane. Initially, Billy comes across as an edgy, smart guy. As the story progresses, he turns out to be more pathetic than anything else, and that's just sort of depressing and not something I really want to read about. It was a shame that the momentum couldn't continue. This book went from being a true page-turner that I hated to put down to something that I didn't want to pick up. I did finish it, but I didn't really want to.	2005-01-13

I couldn't bring myself to finish it. There were a few great lines, I'll give it that. However, the occasional bon mot does not a good book make. It's a rather short book, so even though I didn't like it, I thought I would finish it anyway. I couldn't do it: I read up until about 1/2 to 3/4 of it and realized there are way too many other books I want to read for me to waste any more time on this one. I think it depends on the reader; I know someone who loved it. I'm just not one of those people.	2005-01-13

Little does he know that Joey survives, swims to safety, and proceeds to make his life miserable. Hilarity ensues.   I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Hiaasen at a reading festival several years ago where he was the keynote speaker. He was as friendly and gracious as could be, and this was after hours and hours of signing books and chatting with fans.   As a lifelong resident of Florida (a.k.a. a \\"cracker\\") I can relate to his stories, characters and the locales he uses in his books. I'm not sure I would appreciate his books (or him) as much if I weren't a Floridian, but since I am, it's irrelevant.  On that note, keep up the good work, Mr. Hiaasen!	2004-12-31

Both books are a little on the dark side, and this one should appeal more to single women who are a little more neurotic than average. Although in my opinion it's not as good as Hunger Point, it was engrossing and difficult to put down, and that has to count for something. The protagonist, Janey, is likeable and endearing, and I found myself really wanting to make sure she came out ok in the end.	2004-12-31

This book moves quickly and is hard to put down, but at the same time it's ultimately discouraging and rather depressing. The writing was pretty good for the most part, and I enjoyed certain aspects of the book. However, the main character, Allison, comes off as someone who is willing to settle for less than what she deserves in the man department. And it doesn't help that the author tries to make Allison sound like a loser for being a Christian earlier in life. I won't give away the ending, but I thought it (the ending) was pretty awful: as the story ends, Allison's hanging out with a guy who has been a jerk to her and showed her no respect. And this is supposed to be her potential &quot;Big Love&quot;? Sad!	2004-08-04

Yes, this book is entertaining in a way, and the pop culture references to the 80s are a Gen-X'ers dream come true. But I just couldn't swallow the whole premise of Dex cheating on his fiance (Darcy) with Darcy's best friend (Rachel) being acceptable because, well, Darcy's basically a witch. That doesn't make it ok! And yes, there are moral absolutes (the author begs to differ) and cheating on your fiance with her best friend should be taboo! Rachel struck me not as a heroine or winner, but as an idiot for wanting to be with someone who is a cheater. Call me crazy, but last time I checked, having an &quot;affair&quot; with your best friend's fiance is absolutely morally wrong.	2004-08-04

This book is wonderful, and needed to be written! It's obvious that for some reason, the average person has completely forgotten the rules of grammar he/she was taught as a child. Someone needed to point this out, and that's exactly what Lynn Truss did when she wrote this clever little book about punctuation. As Ms. Truss points out, it is disheartening and discouraging that even movie titles (&quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot;, anyone??) are grammatically incorrect these days. It's like no one cares anymore, or cares to know, that there are rules that cannot just be ignored. Maybe, just maybe, this will make people more aware of this problem and they will make more of an effort from now on. It's really not that difficult, and haven't we all been &quot;dumbed down&quot; enough? Thank you so much, Ms. Truss, for this book! The world needs it!!	2004-07-18

I have to admit that I was surprised to discover who was responsible for the murders, though. I thought it was a little far-fetched, but I must admit that I didn't see it coming. <BR>All in all, this book isn't bad. This is what I would consider a &quot;beach read&quot; or summer book.

However, Rescuing Rose is definitely enjoyable, and I found it very hard to put down.

This takes away from Phoebe's intelligence and her other qualities that would make her a good person and a person worth knowing and caring about. Also, at about the hundredth mention of how beautiful and attractive she is to the opposite sex, the subtlety wears a little thin. Having said that, the book does have its moments, and I thought in general it had a lot of potential but ultimately fell short. It had a lot of promise in the beginning, but didn't follow through. Phoebe ends up coming across as an unlikable and empty sort of person, one of those annoying women who are always trying to call themselves victims and blame everyone else for their so-called unhappiness. I couldn't relate to her at all and it's unfortunate that the author chose to write a character who is such a cliche`. Also, the sexual references are disgusting, crude and totally gratuitous. I would recommend Why She Went Home instead.	2004-04-23

I did finish it, but it was one of those books I wish I'd never seen in the first place. To sum it up, the author is trying to get a few basic points across to the reader, and I think this is what they are:<br />1. Find out who Eva Cassidy is, and buy her CDs. They're great.<BR>2. It's ok to have an adulterous affair with someone whom you consider a \\"friend\\". Never mind the fact that it's wrong and adultery. If you can convince yourself it's true love, it's ok to disregard the fact that what you are doing is WRONG!<BR>3. Did I mention Eva Cassidy? I know you've never heard of her, but I have and she's wonderful. Buy her CDs and listen to them.<br />The main character in this story, \\"Tucker Jones\\", really comes across as a selfish, shallow jerk. He wants to seem cool to his kids so he lets them use profanity when they talk to him, and he lets them talk about drugs nonchalantly like it is no big deal. And the icing on the cake is that he has an affair with Lily, a friend of his who happens to be married with children, but this is the first time he has \\"truly loved\\" someone, so it surely must be ok!! (Please!)<BR> <BR>I wanted to like this book and it did have promise, but for the most part I just really developed a dislike for Tucker, the selfish, arrogant, egotistical man whom the story is about.

Miserably! He just wants to be loved...but it has to be by the right social group. Hence the tragedy. Dreiser is an absolute genius, and this is probably his greatest novel.

There are constant mentions of Nicholas' visits to prostitutes, and I won't ruin it for you by telling what Etna does. This story is a good reminder of how bad things can happen when you marry for the wrong reasons, and when there is not a mutual and equal love on both sides. <BR>I loved this book, and I highly recommend it.

I'm no feminist-but come on!! Any woman who can listen to a man tell her that and accept it, well, that is hard for me to swallow. Other than that, I think you have to give Ethan Hawke some credit.

First of all, he must be pretty hip, since he writes about a lesbian couple (totally gratuitous and a sickening attempt to let us all know just how PC he is). There is not just a mention of this couple. They are totally unnecessary to the story, yet they keep popping up relentlessly. For example, one of the women leaves the other, causing her (I can't remember which one-it doesn't really matter) son to start wetting the bed, from the anxiety that his mother's girlfriend is gone. How sad!! <br />Also, we should learn a lesson from this book besides that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. Besides the fact that there is nothing wrong with being a lesbian, there is nothing wrong with being a drug dealer. Evidently, drug dealers are really just misunderstood, unselfish people who would go out of their way to save your life if only they had the chance. Please!!<br />It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this book. I wanted to like it and read his other books, but I was a little too disgusted by this one to waste my time on any of his other books. <br />If Coben could focus more on his story and plot and less on forcing his political correctness down the readers' throats, he may actually turn out to be a decent writer.	2003-06-07

As a result, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it's actually quite good. There are some graphic and crude sexual references, but other than that, I was quite impressed with this novella. It's short enough and well-written enough that it can be read in one setting. I did strongly disagree with some of the statements used to describe Mr. Ray Porter: &quot;...he is kind, he tries to do the right thing...&quot; when he is actually a man who uses vulnerable women for sex and treats them as prostitutes. I was left wondering why the reader would care anything about Ray Porter, and why it was so important that it be mentioned that he and Mirabelle (the eponymous &quot;shopgirl&quot;) remained friends after their sexual relationship ended. All in all it's a good read which I would recommend. This is the first book of Steve Martin's that I've read, and although I admire his comedic talents, I was not expecting to be as impressed as I was by this book.	2001-01-21

In this day and age, children should be reminded that there's more to life than constantly striving for material possessions, that taking time to enjoy the great outdoors (as well as using that time to think and reflect on life in general) is important, and always has been, and always will be. This book does a superb job of instilling that appreciation of nature and the benefits of time spent in solitude. I read this book to a 7 year old, and I'm pretty sure I enjoyed it more than he did. It's simple, yet speaks volumes in its simplicity. Enjoyable on many levels, this is a wonderful gift for a child, and his parents will thank you.	2001-01-01
US	51138453	R1O4EUARBNNAZ8	0385498799	223812993	Bee Season: A Novel	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Guess I just don't get it	I had heard rave reviews of this book, so I decided to check it out for myself. It's not a bad book: as an English major, I found the spelling/spelling bee mentions and sections interesting. However, I was not so impressed with the theme of Jewish mysticism, or the plotline of the mother who has a serious case of kleptomania. Not a bad book, but also, in my opinion, not deserving of the praise it's receiving. Judge for yourself.	2000-12-31

I had read about it in several different magazines, and it sounded like something that someone who likes the Bridget Jones-genre books (me) would like. So I read it. I kept thinking that I was supposed to feel sorry for Shannon, and I just couldn't bring myself to. She earned her Master's in English and teaches writing classes, comes from a good family, doesn't seem to have a problem meeting men, but yet deserves pity? I don't see it. Also, considering this was a book written by a former English major about an English major, and, in my case, was being read by an English major, the mistakes I found were especially annoying. Here are just a few, there could very well be more, but these were the blatant ones that I couldn't miss: from page 119: &quot;In my stocking I get shampoo and toothpaste, some stamps and stationary, [sic] a toothbrush and an orange.&quot; Or, from page 156: &quot;...a right [sic] of passage...&quot; And on page 157: &quot;'Did other people pass with disctinction [sic]?'&quot; Ouch! It wasn't a bad book, but after a while I found myself reading the book less for the story and more out of curiousity-where would the next mistake be? Not a bad book, all in all. I do look forward to her next book, whatever and whenever that may be. In the meantime, Shannon Olson would do well to hire a new editor. Also-if the next book is about the same character-I hope she isn't called &quot;Shanny,&quot; as that can really grate on the reader's nerves after hearing it the first 20 or so times.	2000-10-07

I can't remember where I heard about it, but someone  recommended this one to me. They shouldn't have! I cannot believe this man  has written 40+ books!  Then again, Danielle Steele and Grisham are rather  prolific, too.  I guess this is one of those authors for whom quantity is  more important than quality. Maybe this is the worst book he has written,  and it is not fair to judge his writing ability (or lack therof) by this  one, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I am certainly not going to  waste my time with anything else he has written.	2000-08-06
US	51138453	R4H48NU618C2Q	0446673757	762557319	Mail	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Could have been better	This book was well-written for the most part, but Katinka was a little hard for me to like. Here she is, an intelligent woman, and could she be a little more promiscuous?  I thought that this book was enjoyable to a  degree, but that the plot just lacked something and wasn't exactly  gripping. It's not a bad book, and some parts were very enjoyable,  especially those sections involving the adorable Max.	2000-07-01

It is SO hilarious! Keyes is such a brilliant writer. I found myself making notes of one funny passage after another. How about this one: &quot;Gossiping was a  kind of McDonald's for my psyche. Irresistible at the time, but I always  felt sort of disgusting afterward. And hungry again ten minutes  later.&quot; This book is highly entertaining. I am thankful it is as long  as it is; I didn't want it to ever end!  Although I was curious to see how  the Daniel situation panned out...My next book to be read is _Watermelon_  which is also by Keyes. I hope to see much more of Keyes in the future. I  love this book!	2000-06-18

I am so glad I did! As a single woman looking for Mr. Right, I could certainly relate to Tiffany's trials. The book is funny and  inspiring, and although I must admit that I feared for the ending, it was  pulled off just beautifully. I cannot wait to read more from Isabel Wolff!	2000-04-08

I saw it in the store and for some reason after reading the back, thought it might be good. Well, normally it takes me a few days to a week to read a  book. I started this one about a month and a half ago and just finished it  today. Why I didn't stop reading it before I wasted my time reading the  whole thing, I'll never know. PLEASE don't be fooled like I was! This book  was really bad!	1999-11-27

It looked interesting from the jacket, and as I read it I was pleasantly surprised to discover the pro-God stance taken by Mei. It is rare to find such a book with such references. I  applaud Tan on this charming and funny novel. I hope to hear more from her  in the near future.	1999-08-27

I went to several bookstores and couldn't find it, so I checked it out from the library. The only reason I give the book any stars at all is because it  deals with books, bookstores, and people who work in bookstores, 3 of my  favorite things. The story jumped around quite a bit. All of a sudden she  was going to be in a movie or something...I'm still trying to figure out  where that came from-but not enough to reread any of this book. I am just  grateful that I didn't spend any money on it.	1999-07-05
