It ranged from his rowdy youth to his unsettled middle age, explaining marital woes, his since-repaired estrangements from his kids, and his passions with the same eloquence he brought to his radio shows. Here are some excerpts from \\"Village Creek\\" that illuminate Bax's character:<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"I came out of the church feeling like I really didn't belong in there either. Not like the little old lady with the black shawl over her head, grown to the pew in the back. But just being outside and walking felt good, and I struck out down the railroad track that cuts across the field. ... I'd tell Mary I'd been to church, praying. Surely God understood sinners like me. He made king snakes, too, didn't He? They're snakes, but good-looking ones, and they don't hurt anybody.\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"They left me alone by (Mamma's) grave. When I finally turned around, the bunch of them were going away toward the cars. I stood a moment, feeling the separation. Then I hurried after them, head down, so nobody could see the clown mask both laughing and crying. Mamma had said, 'Son, you don't have to march along with the herd. That way you can only see their behinds. Go upstream if you want to ... you can see their faces.'\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"My music. I am a feather before the winds of it. I cannot write it, I cannot play it, I cannot even describe it to my fellows because I am ignorant of the language, the terms of the art. But when I am open and it comes pouring out of me, they know out there in the crowd and they are with me.\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />[One time, he took J.P. \\"The Big Bopper\\" Richardson for a plane ride, where he tried to illustrate how easily a pilot might be fooled by his eyes:]<br /><br />\\"With his eyes closed, J.P. said it felt like we were climbing. I told him that if a non-instrument pilot flew into weather where he could not see the horizon, he would have about 90 seconds to live before he lost it.<br /><br />\\"We had just rehearsed the Big Bopper's death.\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"There were no guidelines for divorce back in my family. I grew up watching the other things you could do. You could faint, go crazy, get cancer, sink into the bottle and stare out with fluid eyes and keep saying, 'I love you, my darling,' while performing the long, slow hatred ritual of death by drowning in the sheets.\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"Outside, the thin clouds covered the glow of a full moon.

They hit the high points of extraordinary people, places and events (although a few more contemporary notable figures and spots are noticeably absent) and provide a logical unfolding for the traveler.<br /><br />It's worth the effort and worth the time to use this book as a guide for your next excursion into Texas yesteryear.	2005-05-27

His life and death are part of our lore more than our common history. But Eig does a beautiful job of chronicling both in human, concrete terms, not in the poetic abstractions of baseball memory. Don't get me wrong: I love the poetic abstractions of baseball, but here we get a glimpse of the kind of flesh-and-blood hero we haven't had for a long time, engaged in a rise and fall unlike any we see in a media-saturated 21st century.<br /><br />Eig's writing is full of the pain, celebration, quiet nobility and raw physical strength that made Lou Gehrig. The fact that a sports figure remains a figure worth our money, time and interest 60 years after he died is testament to his contribution to the sport and the impact of his personal courage.<br /><br />Gehrig wasn't without flaws. Rather he was a perfect antithesis to teammate Babe Ruth, a significantly flawed fella who wasn't without his personal qualities. Together, they stand as icons of the golden age of the sport, and Eig's biography pointedly (and poignantly) paints Gehrig as a myth-in-the-making, utterly unaware of his deity-to-be.<br /><br />And that's how it should be.	2005-05-27

Fergus embroiders his tale with enough threads of truth (and a healthy bibliography) that it resonates with authenticity, but the heart and soul of the story are equal parts of Fergus' hope and imagination. And it's a little prayer that somehow the truth can truly be rewritten.<br /><br />Fergus is a poetic writer, but not a florid one. His gift is in simple prose, vivid action and human stories. Like other literary writers of the West, the landscape and climate loom large as distinct characters that color the hearts, minds and actions of the human players. For the money and genre, Fergus is as good a storyteller  as Kent Haruf, William Kittredge, Ivan Doig and Thomas McGuane, and with Mark Spragg and others, represents the next wave of gifted regional authors.<br /><br />(And for those fans of Fergus' columns and nonfiction, a sad note: His faithful yellow Labrador Sweetzer, a fixture in Fergus' 1999 road-essay book, \\"The Sporting Road,\\" died in 2003.)<br /><br />This new novel's journal structure, punctuated by third-person segments from other points of view, is an authorial minefield, but Fergus tiptoes through it skillfully. While telling his story in the journal structure might have been safer, it also would have mirrored the structure of \\"One Thousand White Women.\\" The current commercialism of publishing notwithstanding, who can blame an author for not wanting to repeat himself?<br /><br />Moreover, who can blame an author for wanting to rewrite an unpleasant history? \\"The Wild Child\\" is a tragic life seen through a prism of time, heartbreak  and distance, and the light has been refracted into something poignant and spiritual.n unpleasant history? \\"The Wild Child\\" is a tragic life seen through a prism of time, heartbreak   and distance, and the light has been refracted into something poignant and spiritual. <br />	2005-05-17

It is, at times, gut-wrenching. When the men who were there come forward to say, \\"Yeah, that's exactly how it was,\\" then the reader should take notice. It's best for the reader not to dally on the decades-after-the-fact second-guessing by armchair tacticians ... they simply have a theoretical, perfect-world view that's less affected by bullets whizzing over their heads -- and through their buddies' faces -- than by textbook strategy and tactics.<br /><br />Better, if you want some idea of the fear and confusion our boys in Iraq might be facing right now, read Moore and Galloway's account. It's a different war, a different enemy, a different place, a different time ... but boy's hearts don't change.	2005-05-01

It was a fascinating glimpse into the superstar lawyer's life, but now also stands as the last contemplation on the subject from one of the premier -- and most high-profile -- American lawyers of this generation. It's possible that Johnnie Cochran is the Clarence Darrow for our day -- and equally possible that he isn't. Many great lawyers exist, and many aren't as media-savvy as Cochran was.

That's the premise of this excellent history about the development of \\"freedom colonies\\" in Texas (and throughout the South) by freed slaves seeking a piece of land to call their own. The authors have thoroughly explored a little documented phenomenon in Texas history, and presented the reader with an excellent reference unlike any you'll read anywhere else.<br /><br />The possible reasons this chapter in African-American history are many, according to the book: maybe the essential \\"political incorrectness\\" of admitting the colonies were often begun with white benefactors and assiduously tended their separation from Jim Crow society. Also, because they purposely kept low profiles.<br /><br />But whatever the reason, this bit of history shows that not all of the South was a primeval wasteland where Night Riders, exploitive plantation owners, and racists of all kinds were prowling the countryside, making life hell for freedmen. Without a doubt they did, and the misery of feudal sharecropping is real. But for as many as a quarter of freed slaves, the \\"freedom colonies\\" were the gateway to a new life, truly free from bondage, and a step toward complete (legal) equality 100 years later.	2005-03-15

Far from being a Lefty poking fun at Righties (although Stewart -- the person -- certainly is that), this book doesn't discriminate. So if you're a humorless Lefty who cannot imagine anyone poking fun at your sacred cows, go buy Al Franken's book and allow your sensibilities to remain unchallenged. (And the same goes for the Right ... except you might want to pick up Anne Coulter or Bill O'Reilly's books.)

He brings a newspaperman's observations and senses to the project, which connects all the dots in the tragic last tour for Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. \\"The Day the Music Died\\" is not only entertaining -- somber and occasionally macabre in appropriate moments, and humorous elsewhere -- but it describes the days and weeks leading up to the tragic crash in Clear Lake through the eyes of people who were there. In each case, he paints a vivid portrait of a fallen star, making their stories all the more tragic. To read this book is to understand how American rock 'n' roll evolved from its early, innocent roots toward the fragmented, even chaotic market it encompasses today.

They are good-looking, irascible older gals who embrace their baser impulses and need more than they've gotten.

Sanderson is an extraordinary storyteller, with a precise ear for dialect and a keen eye for detail. In this case, his context is the Rio Grande border wars in South Texas -- a landscape he knows intimately. Sometimes, historical fiction isn't 'true' to history, but Sanderson does a little-told history proud, blending the literary tradition of Larry McMurtry and the adventure tradition of Louis L'Amour. He knows the landscape, the lore, the people and the raw wildness of frontier Texas well. \\"Nevin's History\\" is well worth the read!	2004-10-31

What might seem a nuance is actually quite startlingly different.<br /><br />Africa has popped up in the well-traveled Banks' stories before. The setting for some of the storytelling in his 2001 short-story collection, \\"Angel on the Roof,\\" it provides an atmospheric context for complex exploration of black and white, head and heart, man and beast, love and survival ... sanity and madness.<br /><br />Banks' themes of terror, self-doubt, the collision of races (if not worlds), the relentless passage of time, and political violence are not the stuff of modern commercial book-publishing, but he keeps coming back to them with incisive style.<br /><br />Banks remains one of America's most readable literary authors. He's always tackled grand issues with grand prose, and his muscular narrative generally wins. Often compared to Graham Greene, Joseph Conrad or William Faulkner -- not the most accessible trio of literary writers ever assembled -- Banks sets himself apart as more clear, if not more relevant, for today's readers.

They prowl the obscure corners of human behavior, seeking to drag something back out to the light. But sometimes, the path only leads them deeper, darker.<br /><br />Dr. Ricardo Ainslie -- both an author and a psychologist -- has been chasing shadows along Huff Creek Road in Jasper, where James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death in one of the past century's grisliest hate crimes. And each step has taken him deeper into the darkest recesses of a decayed mind.<br /><br />Countless articles, books and films have documented how King and two white friends -- fellow ex-con Russell Brewer and Shawn Berry -- offered the drunken Byrd a ride in the wee hours of June 7, 1998. But they didn't take him home. Instead, they chained him by the ankles to the rear bumper of Berry's truck and literally dragged him to pieces on a hard-pan logging road. They purposely left his dismembered corpse in the front yard of a small African-American church and cemetery.<br /><br />And King -- whose body was almost completely swathed in racist and Satanic tattoos, whose apartment concealed a stash of racist literature and clothing splattered by Byrd's blood, and whose distinctive cigarette lighter was found at the scene -- was the first of the three to stand trial. Widely seen as the ringleader of the butchery, he was convicted and sentenced to die. Unrepentant and his appeals all but exhausted, the 29-year-old King now awaits execution.<br /><br />But those trials didn't answer a central question: What made Bill King a monster?<br /><br />Partly at the request of King's father, the 55-year-old University of Texas psychology professor was drawn deep into the sometime savage, sometimes frighteningly ordinary world of a small-town killer.<br /><br />\\"Bill King, the man, is much more human than we would care to think,\\" Ainslie writes. \\"When the global media descended ... in a relentless hunt for sensational material, they constructed a perhaps comforting, but ultimately obscuring, myth about King's monstrous nature. ... The truth is that King is all too close, in kind and in temperament, to me or to you.\\"<br /><br />In King, we see a dim and distant reflection of ourselves, Ainslie suggests. Author Hannah Arendt coined the phrase \\"banality of evil\\" to portray the Nazis who perpetrated the Holocaust, and Ainslie invokes it for other acts of evil.<br /><br />\\"To attempt to understand the motives at work in Bill King's life, to understand that there were reasons for his behavior, is not to exonerate him,\\" Ainslie explains. \\"If we avoid examining King's life for fear that such an effort might appear to excuse him, then we risk missing precisely what we most need to know about this story.\\"<br /><br />One of the most unsettling elements of the 254-page \\"Long Dark Road\\" is its hypothesis that \\"given the right alchemy, perhaps anyone might become capable of monstrous cruelty.\\"<br /><br />\\"The transgressions involved may not be as momentously horrifying as the dragging death of an innocent man,\\" Ainslie says, \\"but I believe that human beings, by nature and perhaps by wiring, struggle with our dark sides.

It slid head-first into the incalculable depth of memory and dreams about a sport defined too often by esoteric calculations. In short, \\"Shoeless Joe\\" by W.P. Kinsella captured the pure, lump-in-the-throat intimacy of fathers playing catch with sons.<br /><br />In a very short time, it came pouring out, all the poetry, metaphor and sensuality of base-ball. It was like a literary tarp being dragged across the field of American letters by pa-tient, undaunted groundskeepers whose only job was to keep baseball fiction forever green and unmuddied. The life-imitates-baseball genre provided reading material for little-boy right-fielders who'd grown into love-handled ESPN addicts, as well as the scripts for several Kevin Costner movies.<br /><br />But nobody captured Kinsella's original and literally fantastic brand of magical realism, where the ghosts of legendary players could play in an Iowa cornfield, or a 2,000-inning Cubs game of mythic proportions could go unrecorded by history.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />Howard Frank Mosher, one of the most versatile and funny American storytellers since Mark Twain, grew up playing Little League and town ball. On summer nights when the Red Sox played the Yankees, his father and uncle would drive him to a nearby mountaintop, where the play-by-play radio signal was clearer.<br /><br />So it's probably as natural as outfield grass at Fenway Park that Mosher has written his ninth book about baseball. But as Mosher himself admits, \\"Waiting for Teddy Williams\\" is about baseball in the way that \\"A River Runs Through It\\" is about fly-fishing.<br /><br />\\"Waiting\\" is more clear-eyed than Kinsella's gauzy and poetic \\"Shoeless Joe,\\" but equally poignant. Both pluck the chords that resonate with lovers of old-time baseball, who see larger-than-life ballplayers like Ty Cobb, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams through the fun-house mirror of memory. That is, larger than larger-than-life.<br /><br />But for all its echoes of Kinsella, Mosher's blend of quirky characters, contemporary mythology, and mischievous prose is utterly original and entertaining. One needn't be a die-hard baseball fan to enjoy this story, but if you know the difference between a \\"knuckler\\" and a \\"slider\\" - and the smell of new-mown outfield grass or the taste of sandlot dust - you'll probably read this book then tuck it safely on a shelf beside baseball classics such as \\"The Boys of Summer\\" and \\"The Pride of the Yankees.\\" It's that good.<br /><br />In \\"Waiting for Teddy Williams,\\" Mosher has stolen home as a consummate humorist - proving his uproariously funny 2003 Lewis-and-Clark satire, \\"The True Account,\\" wasn't just a checked-swing triple.<br /><br />OK, enough baseball puns.

And the action picks up at the same pace it left off.<br /><br /> The promise of confronting a killer that even killers fear is how Riordan coaxed his popular protagonist out of literary retirement. &quot;Cold Springs,&quot; was his fourth book, but his first without Navarre.

A blinded Vietnam veteran grapples with the horror of war and his own participation in it. A lame carpenter wandering through India meets some attackers with uncommon ferocity and his existence is transformed. A young woman contemplates ancient ways and human evolution on a camel trek across an Asian desert.<br />Each fictional autobiographical essay -- also presumably left in plain sight as the writer flees a different foreign city ahead of faceless American authorities -- is accompanied by a haunting monotype by artist Allen Magee. The imaginative blend of words and art, especially the wounded faces of Magee's unique portraits, is rare in fiction and, in this case, evocative.<br />For all its imaginative value, \\"Resistance\\" is not above a few small criticisms.<br />Primarily, the passionate and post-modern Lopez -- the National Book Award-winning author of \\"Arctic Dreams\\" and \\"Light Action in the Caribbean\\" -- doesn't differentiate the voices of his nine characters enough to give them the uniqueness of humanity. They all seem to share Lopez's voice, and as singular as it is, the reader encounters them more as nine version of the same individual rather than nine distinctive people.<br />Moreover, while most have extraordinary moments of personal discovery, they all come off as occasionally self-obsessed, overthinking and understimulated depressives. If the vanguard of a new utopia is led by people like these, somebody better remember to pack the Prozac.<br />Nonetheless, Lopez's writing is as stunningly original as his passion.

And Edmundo Paz Soldan's new English edition of \\"The Matter of Desire\\" is not only the latest, but maybe the most commercial work from this intriguing genre.<br />Barely 37, Paz Soldan is already an important literary figure in Bolivia. And in the process of becoming one of Latin America's rising literary stars, he's become a leading figure in that continent's newest literary movement.<br />Earlier this year, Oprah anointed Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 1970 classic \\"100 Years of Solitude,\\" and introduced her book-buying hordes to magical realism. The groundbreaking novel is set in the fictional village of Macondo, a rural environment populated and/or haunted by ever-present spirits. The result was poetic prose that slipped effortlessly between the natural and supernatural.<br />But kids will be kids. In the 1990s, young Chilean novelist Alberto Fuguet led other Latin American Gen-X writers in a new direction. Their stories often have one foot on each American continent, embracing rather than denying the inextricable entanglement of North and South American cultures. They abandoned the bucolic settings of the interior for more urban, hip context where McDonald's, iMacs, and MP3s are more pervasive than ghosts of the past. Thus, with a tongue-in-cheek homage to Marquez's Macondo, the new literary movement became known as \\"McOndo.\\"<br />Like Paz Soldan's protagonist, McOndo writers are often suspended between Americas, between their sometimes sordid history and their urbane future. Their characters are often proud Latin Americans who have succumbed to the North American siren song. Their settings span both continents, too. Their neo-realism is edgy, erotic, virtual and cool. What it *isn't* is exotic and metaphysical. It is evolutionary, not revolutionary.<br />In \\"The Matter of Desire,\\" Paz Soldan explores the concrete obsessions of love and sex, fathers and sons, literature and word puzzles, past and future, place and dislocation. Besides exploring a hip \\"new\\" storytelling model, Paz Soldan tells a story with fascinating twists and turns. It's also a complex love story marbled with political suspense, erotic fascination, and a sense that we are all tethered to a parallel existence in a different place and time.

Owen Wister's &quot;The Virginian&quot; and Larry McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; remain the gold standard for literature of the frontier West.<br />Uh, make that the American West. It's good to be reminded, as Guy Vanderhaeghe's &quot;The Last Crossing&quot; does, that Canada also had a vast, unexplored western territory. And while rails were rapidly being laid across virgin earth and Custer was hurtling toward his last stand, no territorial border truly divided the American and Canadian wildernesses. Marauding Indians, greedy whites, hungry animals and a budding mythology simply didn't appreciate international boundaries.<br />Blending intense action with masterly characterization, Vanderhaeghe appeals on various levels. Whether his huge popularity in Canada will trickle south of the border remains to be seen, but this new novel is a sharp and eloquent import. The big question is: Can American readers embrace a sprawling adventure of higher literary value?<br />He has sometimes been dunned by critics for excruciatingly detailed prose, but such criticism is neither warranted in this case nor unexpected in modern commercial publishing, where action is more highly valued than character.<br /> Vanderhaeghe disregards those boundaries. &quot;The Last Crossing&quot; is a far more satisfying story of a small band's westward journey than McMurtry's rambling, four-part Berrybender Narratives, which began in 2002 with &quot;The Sin Killer&quot; and will end later this year with &quot;Folly and Glory.&quot;<br />While Vanderhaeghe doesn't rival McMurtry in his prime, - these characters are not nearly as engaging as &quot;Lonesome Dove's&quot; Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, nor are their travails as gripping - he has contributed a new frontier novel that is braver and more eloquent than all but a handful in the Western oeuvre, Canadian or American.ut a handful in the Western oeuvre, Canadian or American.	2004-02-17

In fact, a star-struck small-town sheriff once posed with a beaming John Dillinger as if they were two frat boys at a college reunion. A good-looking criminal was a celebrity.<br />Now James Carlos Blake tells their story through the eyes of one of the most charming and charismatic -- and least known -- of the Depression-era gangsters: \\"Handsome\\" Harry Pierpont.<br />Blake's eight novel is a brilliant portrait of the real-life Pierpont, Dillinger`s bank-robbing partner, and other not-so-famous bandits who almost made bank robbery, gun molls and Tommy guns fashionable. The time, place and people all come alive through Blake.<br />Told by Pierpont himself on the night before his 1934 execution, the novel has an appealing intimacy. Blake captures the outlaw cant perfectly, from psychopathic narcissism to jailhouse bravado to paranoid remorselessness. In short, the gutsy Blake mimics a true criminal marvelously while telling an alluring story.<br />Some of the myths are woven into Harry's tale, and some are only made delightfully more mysterious. For example, there's Dillinger's legendary, um, physical endowment -- a story that arises from a famous morgue photo which shows an enormous  protuberance under the bandit's death-sheet. Pierpont's story? He claims to be even more gifted than his partner in crime, which is why he was also nicknamed \\"Pete.\\" Ah, the mythology is safe a while longer.<br />\\"Handsome Harry\\" is not a departure for the seductively violent Blake, but a refinement. It still carries his trademark carnage, redolent sex and dry humor, but it is also a beguiling, hurtling digression into a new voice for Blake. It's not just first-person point-of-view, but it's crawling inside a character who really lived and re-building him from the inside out without disturbing the patina of legend that colors him. And it's all jake.-building him from the inside out without disturbing the patina of legend that colors him. And it's all jake.	2004-02-03

And life tantalizes each one just beyond the fences -- real and imaginary -- that hold each of them captive. The result is a portrait of people at war -- with enemies abroad and with themselves.<br />POWs are expected to try to escape, and the consequences of failing can be fatal. But what happens when an escapee doesn't cross concertina wire and elude floodlights, but crosses bloodlines and eludes the stultifying glare of intimate history?<br />Yarbrough, a native Mississippian who now teaches creative writing at California State University in Fresno, is a sophisticated, gentle writer with a gift for subtlety. The latent heat of a Delta autumn wafts through his absorbing prose as surely as the complexities of small-town life float through his Southern memories. His voice is genteel and a little nostalgic, but neither fragile nor elegiac. His characters are superbly fleshed out, and his settings so richly drawn that when the action traverses the county line late in the book, the reader might feel as if he is leaving his own hometown.<br />Or escaping.	2004-01-26

Or perhaps something bigger: A world where West and Middle East might never set aside two millennia of discord.<br />Ball's third novel is one of those sweeping historical epics that encompasses diverse cultures and decades in a part of the world -- and human affairs -- that is still scoured by the crosswinds of conflict. His history is concrete, but a novel is not merely a history textbook. It must engage the reader with characters, literally individual humans with dreams, losses, flaws, quests, regrets, fears, faith and misgivings. Pasternak did it. So did Clavell, Michener and Jean Auel.<br />Comes now David Ball, who has built an action-packed, often erotic and always sensual epic-adventure around a handful of well-developed characters swept up in the maelstrom of 16th century holy wars between two different worlds. Merely developing three-dimensional characters in modern publishing is a rare notion; sustaining a reader's interest in them over nearly 700 pages is the literary equivalent of finding weapons of mass destruction in Baghdad. It might happen, but it's damned hard to do.<br />But in 1552, there are no weapons of mass destruction. Battles are fought with blades, pikes, crude firearms, armor and horses. There is no such thing as an air war, and navies are powered by slaves and wind. There is no shock nor awe, only sieges that can last months or years.<br />One of the truest tests of a good historical novel is how inextricably fiction entangles with fact. &quot;Ironfire&quot; is marbled with real historic figures such as the near-mythic Muslim pirate Dragut Rais; Jean Parisot de la Valette, the Grand Master of the Knights of St. John whose name was given to Malta's capital city; and even Father Jesuald, a heretic priest burned at the stake in Malta for advocating priestly marriages.<br />And infusing every action is the pungency of smoldering religious fires, not just Islam and Christianity, but Judaism, too. In that combustible mix of passions alone, Ball captures the essence of a modern catastrophe.<br />If walls could talk, they'd eagerly tell their stories to Ball.orical novel is how inextricably fiction entangles with fact. &quot;Ironfire&quot; is marbled with real historic figures such as the near-mythic Muslim pirate Dragut Rais; Jean Parisot de la Valette, the Grand Master of the Knights of St. John whose name was given to Malta's capital city; and even Father Jesuald, a heretic priest burned at the stake in Malta for advocating priestly marriages. <br />And infusing every action is the pungency of smoldering religious fires, not just Islam and Christianity, but Judaism, too.

While some scenes in &quot;By Sorrow's River&quot; -- part three in the tetralogy that started with &quot;Sin Killer&quot; and &quot;The Wandering Hill&quot; -- are occasionally absurd and hilarious, others are grisly and exceedingly violent. So maybe it's unwise to pigeon-hole these three books as simply &quot;farce&quot; or &quot;western epic.&quot;  Nor is it clear if McMurtry is pushing the limits of modern commercial storytelling, or just churning out a long story filled with an extraordinary collection of characters who don't intimately engage.<br />Nonetheless, &quot;By Sorrow's River,&quot; continues the saga of the assertive and independent Lady Tasmin Berrybender as her peculiar British family continues on a western expedition in the 1830s, the days of trappers, scalpers and traders. In this segment, the action all takes place between a Green River rendezvous in the Rockies and Mexico.<br />Still, while the character elements of a first-class farce are in place, the story simply doesn't unfold farcically. It's not even a very good western saga, when one considers its author previously told the greatest western epic ever in &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; The simultaneous beauty and menace of the western landscape is not as integral, for one. How awful for an artist to have set the bar too high too soon!<br />So if book reviews are essential consumer advocacy, a conclusion is not difficult: If you liked &quot;Sin Killer&quot; and &quot;The Wandering Hill,&quot; you'll find &quot;By Sorrow's River&quot; as delightful as a third helping of dessert. If you didn't, you'll likely not find anything to kindle your interest here. And if you haven't read any of them, don't start with the third installment, for heaven's sake.<br />This book's strength is in its rapidly unfolding action, but its characters are nowhere near as deftly drawn nor as sympathetic -- nor even as entertaining -- as such icons as Gus McCrae, Aurora Greenway or Sonny Crawford. Tasmin Berrybender is the most fully developed, but remains less engaging.  An author's characters needn't supercede their forebears, but it's difficult to explain if a consummate character-builder like McMurtry suddenly isn't turning out legendary characters any more.l likely not find anything to kindle your interest here.

But that he has combined his familiar landscape and characters with a new twist might cause a pleasant wonder.<br />In &quot;Prairie Nocturne,&quot; the West?s pre-eminent literary novelist rides the wide-open range between Montana and New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, gathering a cast of players for one last inspired grasp at love and celebrity.<br />In a Faulknerian flourish that has threaded through five of his six previous novels, Doig again populates his seventh with some familiar faces in old settings. What Doig fan would be astonished to find the indomitable Angus McCaskill making more than a cameo appearance in Doig?s newest novel?<br />And lest any reader think Doig?s beloved landscape has been relegated to a cameo appearance shorter than any McCaskill?s, fear not. No western writer ? and Doig is the prime living model for that species ? can escape the ageless countryside?s effect on either character or author.<br />Doig?s poetic prose is growing richer and more subtle with each book, like a stone in a river.  In &quot;Prairie Nocturne,&quot; as the narrative entwines the pasts and presents of its three principal characters, his essential themes re-emerge: family, landscape, childhood memory, loyalty, and the inescapability of our past.<br />Doig?s characters, new and old, are unforgettable, and not just because he keeps bringing them back to life in subsequent books. He embroiders them with history, myth and sensuality. Combined with the timeless beauty of his own ancestral ground, they are fast becoming as much a part of the American mind-scape as the Snopes family of Yoknapatawpha.	2003-10-19

He comes home to Great Falls, Mont., only a few times a year, and only for a few lusty days. And always, he buzz-cuts Lucy's hair.<br />Lucy's mother is present but often unaccounted for. With her husband gone and Lucy entering high school, she's taken a job and maybe a lover or two, leaving her daughter to contemplate life, love, sex and loyalty -- mostly her mother's -- on her own.<br />Lucy quickly proves to be a clear-eyed, graceful and immensely funny narrator. While she hurtles toward womanhood -- and all that entails -- she heaps insecurities upon uncertainties as she explores her own budding sexuality. But as Lucy blooms, her mother's youth is fading. The syncopation of their separate rise and fall provides the book's most tender and most trying elements.<br />Fromm's voice -- on loan to Lucy -- is provocative, gritty, erotic, hilarious and genuine, and this book is a fresh breath of teen spirit.	2003-10-02

Only a tape recorder the size of a cigarette pack ... and the sounds of war. She traveled lightly and discreetly, just under the radar of the gatekeepers.<br />Now, \\"Naked in Baghdad\\" chronicles Garrels's Iraq assignments between October 2002 and she left after the war in April 2003 -- from under-the-table visa negotiations, to swimming in a stagnating hotel pool to work off stress, to explaining the haunted life of normal Iraqis to normal Americans nine hours behind her.<br />\\"Naked\\" is intimate, authentic and blunt, without much literary decoration. It's a simple account that offers a real glimpse inside a foreign reporter's life -- and of the grander canvas upon which world events are being painted.<br />Unlike many of the wet-eared young correspondents dispatched to Iraq, Garrels is a hardened veteran, earning her stripes covering conflicts in the West Bank, Chechnya, Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Time zones, border crossings, badge-heavy bureaucrats, language barriers, blood and death are her office furniture.<br />Garrels's account is scrupulously impartial. She openly discusses her skepticism about a war based on suspicions about weapons of mass destruction, but bluntly explains Saddam's intolerable degradations. Garrels is, as one might hope, ultimately fair and balanced. Her goal is to capture the nuances and the ripple-effects of war among people who are directly splashed by it -- and such people rarely dictate the spin of news.<br />\\"Naked in Baghdad\\" certainly adds the most intimate war-reporting in a conflict that changed many of the rules for journalists.	2003-09-06

The strained relations between East and West become a perfect simulacrum for the ruptures between men and women, husbands and wives, sons and fathers.<br />It might be a story set more than 40 years ago, but it illustrates how differently -- and why -- Americans and Europeans see our world, and is published at a time when discussions of nation-building and America's role in the world are being debated.<br />\\"Secret Father\\" succeeds on many levels, some that the ardent anti-war activist Carroll intended, and some which hark back to earlier themes about the necessary relationships between fathers and sons. It is not a book for the casual espionage-lit buff who delights in Clancy-esque Cold War intrigues between cold-blooded Soviet agents and world-saving rogue CIA operatives.

Jones was the first in his family to ever go to college -- an achievement that changed his life in a way he didn't expect.<br />While studying at Holy Cross, Jones stumbled upon a startling fact: Not all slave-owners in the South had been white. Some were black.<br />Raised proud in a familiar black tradition, it stung him. It also haunted him for 20 years, until he could use that single fact as the fascinating premise of his first novel, \\"The Known World.\\"<br />\\"The Known World\\" orbits around Henry Townsend, a black farmer born into slavery.<br />Lest the gentle reader dismiss the premise as the product of a fevered imagination, black slave-owners really existed in pre-Civil War America. Free blacks in Virginia and a few other Southern states -- not many, mind you -- owned their own plantations and the slaves that made them profitable. Jones refers several times to a fictional, 19th century academic pamphlet on the subject of black slave-owners, but the pamphlet never really existed -- further muddling the sometimes ambiguous world Jones explores.<br />The only thing black and white about this remote corner of a newly imagined Virginia -- Jones's home state -- is the reader's anachronistic conviction that slavery was an abomination; most of the black characters in this novel are grayer in their beliefs.<br />Jones's sometimes overly florid narrative dips in and out of time, disrupting rhythms and preconceptions, and provides the most charming technical and structural element of the story. One moment, the reader is mired in the absurdities and vicissitudes of the antebellum flesh trade, and the next he is telescoped to modern-day Richmond where the great-grandchild of a slave -- now a city councilwoman -- is naming the street for ancient forebears.<br />And while Jones's occasionally baroque  prose makes crossing into \\"The Known World\\" slow-going, it is exactly its Biblical rhythms that lend depth to a story about profound moral confusion. The first hundred pages are more confusing than a thousand rhapsodic \\"begats\\" and can be sluggish, but the story meanders to a gentle, satisfying end.ndred pages are more confusing than a thousand rhapsodic \\"begats\\" and can be sluggish, but the story meanders to a gentle, satisfying end.	2003-08-25

But the reader is well-advised to acknowledge the similarities between art and life -- then forget it. \\"Orchard\\" is more. It is filled with characters who are as flawed as their surroundings and circumstances, and a landscape that is achingly painted.<br />Watson's earlier works -- most notably \\"Montana 1948\\" and \\"White Crosses\\" -- have won the Milkweed Fiction Prize, a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, the Mountain and Plains Booksellers Association Regional Award, and many other literary prizes. Publishers Weekly even predicted that if booksellers talk up \\"Orchard\\" it might match the commercial success of \\"Montana 1948,\\" the book that put Watson on the literary map.<br />But it's too bad that books as lyrical as \\"Orchard\\" and writers as starkly poetic as Watson must depend on the kindness of strangers to get the exposure they deserve in today's speed-obsessed marketplace, where character development and thoughtful prose are too-often considered poisonous.<br />In American letters, the good old days of strong characters in dire human straits have dwindled to a handful of writers and books. Even so-called reality TV isn't real. Watson's real-life themes -- lust, self-absorption, jealousy, grief and loss -- will grab the reader's gut and twist it better than any cat detective, cynical ex-CIA operative or vampire terrorist.<br />One must simply venture down a road less traveled.<br />One must simply venture down a road less traveled.	2003-08-25

And once found, we become aware there are places out there that are both foreign and familiar. Funny what the wind brings.<br />And now it brings \\"The Kite Runner,\\" a beautiful novel by Afghan-American Khaled Hosseini that ranks among the best-written and provocative stories of the year so far.<br />Hosseini's first novel -- and the first Afghan novel to be written originally in English -- \\"The Kite Runner\\" tells a heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between Amir, the son of a wealthy Afghan businessman, and Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Amir is Sunni; Hassan is Shi'a. One is born to a privileged class; the other to a loathed minority. One to a father of enormous presence; the other to a crippled man. One is a voracious reader; the other illiterate.<br />The poor Hassan is born with a hare lip, but Amir's gaps are better hidden, deep inside.<br />Yet Amir and Hassan live and play together, not simply as friends, but as brothers without mothers. Their intimate story traces across the expansive canvas of history, 40 years in Afghanistan's tragic evolution, like a kite under a gathering storm.  The reader is blown from the last days of Kabul's monarchy -- salad days in which the boys lives' are occupied with school, welcome snows, American cowboy movies and neighborhood bullies -- into the atrocities of the Taliban, which turned the boys' green playing fields red with blood.<br />This unusually eloquent story is also about the fragile relationship fathers and sons, humans and their gods, men and their countries. Loyalty and blood are the ties that bind their stories into one of the most lyrical, moving and unexpected books of this year.<br />Hosseini's title refers to a traditional tournament for Afghan children in which kite-flyers compete by slicing through the strings of their opponents with their own razor-sharp, glass-encrusted strings. To be the child who wins the tournament by downing all the other kites -- and to be the \\"runner\\" who chases down the last losing kite as it flutters to earth -- is the greatest honor of all.<br />And in that metaphor of flyer and runner, Hosseini's story soars.<br />And fear not, gentle reader. This isn't a \\"foreign\\" book. Unlike Boris Pasternak's \\"Dr. Zhivago,\\" Hosseini's narrative resonates with familiar rhythms and accessible ideas, all in prose that equals or exceeds the typical American story form. While exotic Afghan customs and Farsi words pop up occasionally, they are so well-defined for the reader that the book is enlightening and fascinating, not at all tedious.<br />Nor is it a dialectic on Islam. Amir's beloved father, Baba, is the son of a wise judge who enjoys his whiskey, television, and the perks of capitalism. A moderate in heart and mind, Hosseini has little good to say about Islamic extremism.<br />\\"The Kite Runner\\" is a song in a new key. Hosseini is an exhilaratingly original writer with a gift for irony and a gentle, perceptive heart. His canvas might be a place and time Americans are only beginning to understand, but he paints his art on the page, where it is intimate and poignant.encrusted strings.

Unlike Boris Pasternak's \\"Dr. Zhivago,\\" Hosseini's narrative resonates with familiar rhythms and accessible ideas, all in prose that equals or exceeds the typical American story form. While exotic Afghan customs and Farsi words pop up occasionally, they are so well-defined for the reader that the book is enlightening and fascinating, not at all tedious.    <br />Nor is it a dialectic on Islam. Amir's beloved father, Baba, is the son of a wise judge who enjoys his whiskey, television, and the perks of capitalism. A moderate in heart and mind, Hosseini has little good to say about Islamic extremism.<br />\\"The Kite Runner\\" is a song in a new key. Hosseini is an exhilaratingly original writer with a gift for irony and a gentle, perceptive heart. His canvas might be a place and time Americans are only beginning to understand, but he paints his art on the page, where it is intimate and poignant.	2003-06-17

But Alexie is the mustang: Wild, irreverent, defiant, bold, unpredictable, sleek, distant, erotic, swift and hard to corral -- everything McMurtry never was, even in his prime.<br />Not that Alexie cares. Hes a provocateur who never left a pot unstirred. Hes a trickster not above mocking himself. Hes a proud Spokane/Coeur dAlene Indian who is just as likely to skewer Indians as totem-loving liberals and Yale-educated conservatives (yeah, him.)  And hes a best-selling author who knows exactly how far to push the sensibilities of his gentler readers.<br />And his latest collection of short stories, Ten Little Indians, once again shows him to be not just one of the Wests best, but one of the most brilliantly literate American writers, even funnier than Louise Erdrich, even more primal than Jim Harrison, and even more eloquent than Annie Proulx.<br />Since his 1993 debut, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, Alexie has had few, if any, sacred cows. Including Indians. As with his last collection, The Toughest Indian in the World, the reader is submersed in yarns that are sometimes funny and sometimes heartbreaking, where Indians find themselves between worlds, between lives, and between loves.<br />Ten Little Indians comprises nine easy pieces in the puzzle of Sherman Alexie, who ranks with the best, even if he stands alone.	2003-06-17

It explores the edges of the sometimes-treacherous zones in Erdrich's personal landscape: Family, love and children.<br />\\"Books and Islands\\" is the latest title in National Geographic's Directions series, travel memoirs by some of the world's most highly regarded literary figures, including David Mamet's \\"South of the Northeast Kingdom,\\" and John Edgar Wideman's recent \\"The Island: Martinique.\\"<br />Fans of Erdrich's earlier fiction, such as \\"Love Medicine\\" or \\"The Master Butchers Singing Club,\\" will glimpse the very foundation of her literary vision in this small, easily read volume, which also includes several original drawings by Erdrich.	2003-06-17

The adventurer who beat them (just barely)? Private True Teague Kinneson, a Vermont schoolmaster, veteran of the Ethan Allen's Green Mountain Boys, playwright, inventor, narco-agronomist and explorer.<br />Wearing a belled nightcap to cover the copper plate screwed into his skull (a prosthetic made necessary by a life-altering blow sustained while drinking rum with Ethan Allen), a suit of chain-mail, galoshes and an Elizabethan codpiece, Private Kinneson begins his journey with his artistic nephew, Ticonderoga, into terra incognita.<br />Why? He wishes to teach Indian tribes of the West how to cultivate hemp, which he describes as \\"That panacea for all the spiritual ills of mankind.\\" Oh, and to beat Lewis and Clark.<br />Along their path to the Pacific, True and Ti encounter highwaymen, hostile and not-so-hostile Indians, horny women, cannibals, a circus of freaks, and some of the great real-life people of the day, such as Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Boone (and his frisky daughter Flame), and Sacagawea.<br />And in the midst of his frolic, our American Quixote invents rodeo, baseball and a marvelous hot-air balloon; discovers Yellowstone; and outwits the Devil Himself.<br />Private True Teague Kinneson is every mythic traveler who ever believed the shortest distance between two points was a dream, from Odysseus to Gulliver to his beloved Quixote. And like the Cervantes masterpiece, this boisterously funny novel is more picaresque than poignant, although like any good farce, it occasionally plucks the readers heart-strings as well as his funny-bone.<br />Great parodies resonate at the precise moment we are taking ourselves to seriously (do we really need three exhaustive years to celebrate Lewis and Clark?) Mosher's voice is pitch-perfect, satirical without being too sardonic. And Private True Teague Kinneson just might find his rightful place in American letters somewhere between Gus McCrae and Forrest Gump.<br />OK, it's worth noting that the national epic of Lewis and Clark's expedition surveyed the continent's resources, made contact with many Indian tribes living there, found a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, explained the flora and fauna of the region, created one of the first true Native American heroines, helped build a transcontinental nation, and ... blah blah blah. It was serious business for Captains Lewis and Clark. You can look it up, in all its breathless, geo-political, bio-diverse, Ambrose-flakking, socio-aggrandizing, -- and mind-numbing -- detail.<br />Who cares?<br />Private True Teague Kinneson reminds us that sometimes adventures, like books, are just for fun./>Private True Teague Kinneson is every mythic traveler who ever believed the shortest distance between two points was a dream, from Odysseus to Gulliver to his beloved Quixote.

Today's crime-fiction writers gleefully dispatch more souls than Forest Lawn, and rarely is anyone haunted by the carnage or the shadows.<br />The ghosts are thick in Rick Riordan's new thriller, \\"Cold Springs,\\" but not because a lot of people die in a first few blood-splashed pages.  Quite the contrary. These ghosts -- like Riordan's cast of characters -- once had three-dimensional form and feelings, and they haunt the heart more than the noir-ish corners of rain-slicked clich&eacute;.<br />\\"Cold Springs\\" is Riordan's first stand-alone thriller, a departure from his Edgar- and Shamus-winning series featuring wise-cracking San Antonio private-eye Tres Navarre. While the Texas middle-school teacher has now returned to the character who first put him on the radar, \\"Cold Springs\\" shows he has the chops for more stylish prose in the headlong rush of a multi-level, rapidly twisting plot.<br />Riordan's voice is smooth, accented with a South Texas drawl and punctuated by evocative imagery  -- hills that look like \\"scar tissue, swollen and raw and pink\\" or a voice that \\"stung like sleet.\\" Such metaphor from the mouth of the irreverent Tres Navarre would elicit a Chandler-esque groan -- and often does -- but transplanted to a deeper story with more complex relationships and landscapes, it's not out of place.<br />It's a matter of degree. \\"Cold Springs\\" doesn't portend a new trend toward literary thrillers, but it flirts with slightly more \\"character arc\\" -- the way a protagonist changes over the course of a story -- than most of today's purely plot-driven stuff. It ain't even so high up the tree that it will put off page-turning mystery fans who measure good \\"literature\\" by high body counts and bizarre ways to die. For them, Riordan supplies a steady stream of corpses and unusual wounds.<br />But Riordan is a rising star in crime fiction and, with luck, will help the genre usher back strong plots with complex characters.complex characters.	2003-06-01

Nearly 12 years after a heart bypass surgery plunged him into an abyss of depression, and 17 years beyond his Pulitzer Prize-winning magnum opus, Lonesome Dove, McMurtry has not evaded that single harshest criticism of his fiction: His own. He knows hes not in top form and he admits it.<br />In his autobiographical Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen, he revealed two things, one intentional, one not: He considers himself only a shadow of what he once was, the greatest western novelist of his generation. The second, unintentional revelation? His non-fiction of the past decade has far surpassed his fiction.<br />Comes now The Wandering Hill, sequel to Sin Killer and second in a four-part series about a the eccentric and dysfunctional Berrybender family and its motley coterie -- British nobles in search of adventure, big-game hunting and sex -- as they explore the virgin West of the 1830s.<br />For historical-fiction readers, and especially for fans of the Lewis and Clark era, McMurtry populates this book with supporting characters straight out of Western legend: real-life mountain men Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Tom Fitzpatrick and Hugh Glass, Scottish adventurer William Drummond Stewart, frontier artists George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, trader William Ashley, and Pomp Charbonneau, the son of Sacagawea.<br />Partly because The Wandering Hill ends, in effect, only halfway through the saga, its denouement is underwhelming. The Berrybender adventures are plucked from various unrelated historical accounts. Considered separately, they illustrate the moments of terror the frontier likely held, but the trip often seems as aimless as the Berrybenders journey through unexplored territory.<br />Its difficult to know whether the Berrybenders are ultimately headed to a geographical Eden or some abstract encounter with destiny, or both. One might look at this saga as a kind of western serial, but The Wandering Hill doesnt close at the edge of a cliff, rather on less dramatic footing.<br />If McMurtrys tetralogy follows its pre-ordained literary path -- a tetralogy is four related literary works, traditionally three tragedies followed by a comedy -- the destination might be more interesting than the journey. Sin Killer and The Wandering Hill, with their promise of more to come, feel a lot like historical fluff floating on a wayward breeze.<br />Like Larry McMurtry himself, the Berrybender narratives pale by comparison to earlier greatness.

Perhaps it was the Liffey fog or the Guinness. And, by the hazy way, I was proudly becoming one of only 74 people worldwide who have actually finished \\"Ulysses,\\" an experimental story based on an ancient story.<br />Don DeLillo is apparently another. His new odyssey-come-lately, \\"Cosmopolis,\\" is an ode to Joyce in a new key, but an old cant. It resonates with the same disjunctive, unsettling rhythm of Joyce's 1922 novel, but lacks the texture, orality and genuine humanity. But take heart: It's easier to read -- DeLillo is a consummate master of poetic language -- and it's shorter by hundreds of pages.<br />DeLillo's cast of characters rivals Joyce's, too. Packer's day begins when he bumps into his newlywed bride of 22 days, an aloof poet-heiress, in traffic. He continues his odyssey with various paramours and business advisers (and sometimes the line between them is very vague, indeed), a doctor who examines his asymmetrical prostate in the backseat of the limo, his stump-necked security chief who worries an assassin lurks around every corner and ... well, an assassin lurking around the corner.<br />Compare and contrast: Joyce's hero, advertising salesman Leopold Bloom, sets out across Dublin on a June day in 1904, a deliberate spoof of mythology wrapped in social realism.<br />\\"I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries,\\" James Joyce once crowed about \\"Ulysses.\\" That didn't stop Aldous Huxley from calling it \\"one of the dullest books ever written.\\" One college English professor described his time with \\"Ulysses\\" this way: \\"It was like having a rib ripped out of my body, being beaten with it, raped with it, and then being forced to eat it.\\"<br />So why regurgitate this book based upon the most familiar story in human history, Homer's Odyssey? While it helps to know the Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" was intended to be a comedy -- albeit a \\"comedy\\" only in the tragic Irish sense of the word -- it is one of the most famous books never read.<br />Comes now Don DeLillo, a National Book Award and PEN/Faulkner winner, with his redux of a redux of an endlessly redone original. DeLillo is no Joyce, which is probably good. He's also no Vonnegut, whose four- and five-dimensional characters are far more engaging and intimate as they traverse similar parallel universes.<br />DeLillo is pushing the hidebound limits of commercial fiction in 2003 much the same as Joyce did 80 years ago. For that, he deserves praise. \\"Cosmopolis\\" is nothing if not challenging, thought-provoking and utterly different. One hopes DeLillo wrote it as a comedy, too.<br />But there is simply no single significant character who engages the reader. Every one is emotionally armored, self-absorbed, insane or seemingly incapable of redemption. Packer is promiscuous, greedy, selfish, brusque, dishonest and cold -- and those are his good qualities.<br />On the other hand, if you are among the other 73 readers, besides me, who actually survived Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" you will grasp the far deeper contexts and mysteries of \\"Cosmopolis\\" than the poor mope who finds it under \\"Foreign Exchange Markets\\" in the library card file and thinks it's an international money thriller.glish professor described his time with \\"Ulysses\\" this way: \\"It was like having a rib ripped out of my body, being beaten with it, raped with it, and then being forced to eat it.\\" <br />So why regurgitate this book based upon the most familiar story in human history, Homer's Odyssey?

Mankind's greatest stories from Homer to Hemingway have required their heroes to cross perilous thresholds, from their safe, familiar worlds into a place that would challenge their bodies, hearts and minds. To fail is to die; to succeed is to change irreversibly.<br />And blood is almost always spilled.  Blake has merely elevated bloodshed to a fine art.<br />Blake's newest contribution to historical crime fiction is \\"Under the Skin,\\" a borderland noir about love and crime in Depression-era coastal Texas and northern Mexico. But the real borders it crosses are not just geographic.<br />The bulk of the story is set in gritty and bohemian Galveston in the first few days of 1936, but it really begins 22 years earlier, when Pancho Villa and his most bloodthirsty captain visit an El Paso whorehouse and plant the seed of destiny.<br />Blake was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and is among the brightest stars in historical fiction, particularly where bad men make good stories. All his books have been set in the turbulent times between the dawn of Manifest Destiny and the Depression, wherever humans could inflict the most inhumanity on each other.<br />\\"Under the Skin\\" is brutal and beautiful. Blake's savage crime saga isn't driven only by the body count nor its cold-blooded cruelty. What makes this book -- and Blake's others -- truly horrific are passages of pure poetry and the haunting beauty of Blake's writing.<br />Few writers can skillfully blend the poetic and the perverse, as if the esoteric and animalistic sides of the brain shared an impermeable border. But as Blake has shown, borders are made to be crossed: John Gregory Dunne (\\"True Confessions\\") and James Ellroy (\\"My Dark Places\\") are among the most seasoned travelers to cross that particular boundary, but Blake lives there.<br />His unflinching prose drives stake through fainter hearts, but Blake explores dark borderlands of the human spirit. He has rightfully been hailed as one of the most original writers in America today, and is certainly one of the bravest. \\"Under the Skin\\" and his other previous stories all have the seductive fascination of a beautiful song scrawled in blood.but Blake lives there.<br />His unflinching prose drives stake through fainter hearts, but Blake explores dark borderlands of the human spirit.

All told, Jackson's account is unsentimental when it might have been maudlin, and eloquent when it might have been academic.<br />A Midwestern farm boy from a broken family, Donald Jackson joined the U.S. Navy before the war. He was due to muster out in 1942, but then came Dec. 7, 1941. The radioman, wearing his sweetheart's ring around his neck with his dogtags, came aboard the cruiser USS Santa Fe in 1943.<br />Known as the Lucky Lady because she logged the war's longest tour - 221,750 miles with stops in such exotic hotspots as Wake Island, Tarawa, Saipan and Iwo Jima -- with only two casualties and insignificant damage, the Santa Fe became her crew's guardian angel and surrogate soul.<br />The USS Franklin was the United States' fifth Essex-class aircraft carrier and the fifth naval vessel to carry the name - the original was a fishing boat loaned to the Continental Army in 1775 and re-named for Ben Franklin. Although \\"Big Ben\\" bore the seemingly unlucky naval designation as CV-13, she'd become World War II's most decorated naval vessel.<br />The Franklin and Santa Fe crossed historic paths on March 19, 1945, when a lone Japanese plane dropped two bombs on Big Ben, penetrating both the ship's bowels and brain. Dead in the water without radio contact and very little power, the Franklin was burning fast and listing badly. Worse, much of its crew had been blown overboard, killed or wounded.<br />With 724 killed and 265 wounded, the Franklin's surviving 106 officers and 604 crewmen valiantly tried to save the ship. Jackson recounts the heroic efforts of many of them, including eventual Medal of Honor winners Lt. Cdr. Joseph T. O'Callahan, a chaplain who administered last rites, organized firefighters and rescuers, and helped flood munition magazines before they could explode; and Lt. (jg) Donald Gary, who discovered 300 men trapped in a charred mess hall and made several trips below to lead them to safety.<br />The Santa Fe's crew was no less heroic as it pulled alongside to pluck sailors from the sea and cram its decks and wardrooms with the Franklin's wounded.<br /><br />But \\"Lucky Lady\\" isn't just the story of inanimate steel, fuel oil, and gunpowder that make warships. It's about the men - boys, really - who are the spirit and soul of these two ships.<br />Through them and many others, Jackson captures not only the battle histories of two legendary ships, but the bluejacket's life, from the captain's chair to the deepest, darkest corners of the bilge-soaked hold, from boot camp (\\"Do you like girls, sailor?\\") to burial at sea. All of it is retold here through the eyes of the men who faced death and survived.<br />It is good to be reminded of common men's grace under fire, and that each of them enters the world stage from a place far away. Jackson's old soldiers, already fading away, help him bring this splendid, moving history to readers who will never know them.in the water without radio contact and very little power, the Franklin was burning fast and listing badly.

Love and sex are woven inextricably with law and order to tell a story of human dimensions, where characters' passions are exposed in both the bedroom and the courtroom. And in both cases, those passions can redeem as well as cripple.<br />Happily, \\"Reversible Errors\\" is not a polemic on the death penalty, even though Turow is a Chicago lawyer who has often argued real-life capital cases. For him, a looming execution is a plot thickener, not a chance to take sides in the most debated element of American jurisprudence.<br />He portrays good and bad people on both sides of the bar, in and out of prison.<br />Writer-lawyer Turow doesn't write like a lawyer, but his legal descriptions are occasionally as labyrinthine as modern American crime and punishment can get. Fortunately, those moments, as authentic as they might be in reflecting the twisting and twisted nature of the court system, are brief and rare for lay readers.<br />Turow plays the reader like a jury, sucking us into sympathy with his clients er, characters until we are completely in their world, ready to believe anything.<br />The verdict? \\"Reversible Errors\\" is a sleek legal romp wrapped in stylish prose, and it makes a good case for Turow's primacy in the world of legal thrillers. And, oh, at least one filthy corporate executive dies.	2002-11-01

But like the best-selling \\"Sleepers,\\" \\"Apaches,\\" \\"A Safe Place\\" and \\"Gangster,\\" it's bound by the threads of survival and rootless youth.<br />This isn't Hell's Kitchen or the Bronx, though. It's no man's land: bombed-out Naples in 1943. Among the last people in the evacuated city are lost, abandoned children whose only goal is to survive another day.<br />Survival transforms them into fierce commandos, facing a Nazi tank division sent to demolish the ancient Italian city before Allied armies arrive. The sadistic orders from Hitler himself: If the city can't belong to the Fhrer, it will belong to no one.<br />When Cpl. Steve Connors, a 25-year-old American soldier assigned to scout the city ahead of Gen. George Patton's advance, gets cut off from his own unit, he finds new comrades among Naples' young resistance fighters.<br />Armed with salvaged guns, unexploded German bombs and their own ingenuity, Connors and his army of children are determined to deflect the Nazis and save the city -- or die.<br />But Carcaterra has seldom made conflict easy. His good guys are often a little bad, and his bad guys are sometimes gifted with endearing, even redeeming, qualities. In our real world, such complexities are a fact of life; in commercial fiction, it's rare.<br />Carcaterra's ambitious cast of characters is deftly drawn. Vincenzo Soldari, a 16-year-old history buff determined to follow in his ancestors' footsteps, is the real leader of the children's army. He's helped by Carlo Maldini, a middle-aged drunkard desperate to redeem himself, and his daughter Nunzia, a ferocious guerrilla who falls in love with the American GI who comes to their aid.<br />Carcaterra is working on the screenplay of \\"Street Boys,\\" to be directed by Oscar-winner Barry Levinson. The book lends itself to good cinema: intricate characters, underdogs facing insurmountable odds, a desperate mission and lots of explosions -- the stuff of our best American war movies, from \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"<br />No less complex than World War II novels by Norman Mailer and James Jones, \\"Street Boys\\" explores a different perspective on the war, and rides a fast-paced plot toward a heroic ending. The end of the war and the Allied invasion of Italy are well-known, but it is the transformation of characters along the way that defines the quality of historical fiction.<br />In \\"Street Boys,\\" Carcaterra paints a vivid portrait of children at war, not as its helpless victims, but fighting back.ld history buff determined to follow in his ancestors' footsteps, is the real leader of the children's army.

It's not a rant, but a contemplative journey in which good is always tainted, bad is never pure, and black and white blend to gray.<br />The desperate condition of African-Americans before and after the Civil War is Durham recurring theme.<br />In \\"Gabriel's Story,\\" the protagonist is a 15-year-old African-American boy in the empty middle of the continent after the Civil War, caught between youth and manhood, naivet&eacute; and wisdom, family and flight. It was a classical bildungsroman - a novel about the moral and psychological growth of the main character -- told in masterful prose reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy.<br />In \\"Walk Through Darkness,\\" Durham retraces his literary steps in a different landscape and a different time: That troubled slice of America between Virginia and Pennsylvania where slavery and abolition collided in the anxious twilight before the Civil War.<br />William's story also traces through complex historic and cultural issues. If you were expecting Durham, by virtue of being an African-American, to oversimplify an issue that split America down the middle, you've been reading too many racial polemics. We glimpse extraordinarily humane slave owners, mercenary blacks who gleefully profit from trapping runaways, and a wide array of men and women who are unexpectedly - and refreshingly - conflicted about human bondage.	2002-05-09

Not for writing privacy, but to regulate the flow of suspects in and out of a murder scene.<br />Odd as it sounds, Wyoming is just a big closed room, a boundless place where nobody comes or goes without being noticed. That quality - plus its peculiarities of landscape, attitude and history - makes it a perfect place for murder. Margaret Coel is the doyenne of contemporary Wyoming mysteries (although a Colorado writer) with her Wind River intrigues, the Agatha Christie of the Big Empty. Author C.J. Box has thrown one more Wyoming mystery on the stack, but with a difference: He knows Wyoming the way a life-long native knows it. His debut, &quot;Open Season,&quot; rings true as it gallops over the rugged terrain of environmentalism, small-town politics, outlander greed and exploitation so common to Wyoming. And when Box describes the real landscape of this almost-mythical state, you can rest assured it's dead on.<br />Box's prose is most trenchant, of course, when he's writing about Wyoming. Landscape is not just the territory of the West's literary prose, but it can be found in the region's category fiction, too, proving just as important to genre tales as mainstream. Box nails the taste and smell of the place, and in the process, creates a sensory experience that can be rare in fast-paced, plot-driven crime fiction - without stalling the plot. He finds a way to weave the mysteries of landscape into the larger mystery at hand.<br />The book's inclusion of excerpts from the Endangered Species Act probably doesn't warm anybody's cockles, except very perverse enviro-lawyers. But those deadly segments tend to serve as frontispieces for chapters and are not critical to the narrative, so are easily skipped.<br />It's obvious why &quot;Open Season&quot; has such an easy grasp of the Cowboy State: Box has been a Wyoming ranch hand, fishing guide, survey crewman, small-town newspaper reporter and a high-level tourism executive - all before becoming CEO of a Cheyenne corporation that promotes Rocky Mountain tourism in Europe. When he describes the sound of a bullet slamming into meat, he knows how it sounds. And when he describes a claustrophobic high-country canyon where it's possible to touch both walls, it's because he's been there.e becoming CEO of a Cheyenne corporation that promotes Rocky Mountain tourism in Europe.

Who are they and why do they come? Why do we want them to come? Where do they go? How can we make them spend more money? Why do we make fun of them?

Earth-drying sunlight and earth-rending flood. Night and day. Heaven and Hell ... could any of them exist without their opposite?<br />In her new novel, \\"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse,\\" Louise Erdrich weaves the intricate and the uncomplicated into a story that is, by turns, extraordinarily tangled and beautifully concrete. Opposites dependent upon one another.<br />Maybe it's because Erdrich writes in sacred circles. Families, generations, places, events and individual characters swirl among her various novels. The Turtle Mountain-Pembina Reservation, which sprawls across the Red River halfway into North Dakota -- the setting for \\"Love Medicine,\\" \\"Tales of Burning Love\\" and other Erdrich tales -- is again the crucible where Erdrich re-mixes the lives of the Nanapush, Kashpaw, Morrissey, Mauser, Pillager, Lamartine and Lazarre families. In her work, you'll recognize Faulknerian rhythms: a northern plains Yoknapatawpha where the Sartorises, Snopeses and Compsons are known by Ojibwe names, where voices shift like sand.<br />In circles where the literary air is more rarefied, Erdrich's juxtaposition of disparate concepts might be called *Manichean* -- relating to an ancient spiritual belief that life is governed by an endless battle between equally potent forces of good and evil, neither of which can ever annihilate the other. That's one way to look at it. But while her writing invites a number of interpretive methods and philosophies, it is Spartan and simply human, more Cather than Faulkner. In environs where landscape is less influential to life, readers might see only Manichean metaphors in rivers, forests and blizzards; in the West, it's just the way things are -- starkly contrasted depending on the time of day, the angle of sight, or the weather. The place that is good by day might be evil by dark. It is not just the stuff of Erdrich's writing, but her life, too.<br />The pivotal event in \\"The Last Report\\" is a Dakota flood that not only sweeps Agnes away on the lid of a piano, but also represents her spiritual evolution -- her ordination, if you will -- into Father Damien. A heaven-sent event, delivered by the Muse of Metaphor into the fervid imagination of a writer in need of a symbol? In fact, it is a scene inspired by the 1997 flood on North Dakota's Red River. It is certainly an apt spiritual metaphor, but it is also a simple account of  how fortunes are so swift to change in the Western landscape. Pick your poison, dear reader: Mysticism or reality. They both work.<br />The part-Ojibwe Erdrich, like indigenous writers Sherman Alexie and Leslie Marmon Silko, deftly blends mysticism and dark humor in a complex, compassionate amalgam that, when burnished, not only reflects the Indian experience, but human existence in any color, at any moment in time.Last Report\\" is a Dakota flood that not only sweeps Agnes away on the lid of a piano, but also represents her spiritual evolution -- her ordination, if you will -- into Father Damien.

By hook or crook -- mostly crook -- he rises to the highest echelons of the underworld and, having survived the bullets and mayhem, is dying rather ignominiously as an old man. And his likeliest successor is uncertain he wants to claim his iniquitous inheritance. Sound familiar?<br />Well, fuhgeddaboudit. There's one word even the most astute reader will not find in &quot;Gangster&quot;: Godfather.<br />Puzo admitted he never met an &quot;honest-to-God real-life gangster,&quot; but Carcaterra ate, drank and lived with them most of his life. The author of &quot;Sleepers&quot; and &quot;Apaches&quot; knows these wiseguys intimately, and he understands the public`s long-standing fascination with the Mafia. These characters are not denizens of his vivid and proven imagination; they were his friends and neighbors in Hell's Kitchen, the tough New York neighborhood where he grew up. The son of a convicted murderer didn't hang out with the kids of doctors and lawyers. The goodfellas of Carcaterra's youth weren't today's Russian mobsters and urban street gangs; the best of the Old World gangsters embraced friendship, loyalty and revenge as equally noble. And those very &quot;qualities&quot; have played a role in each of Carcaterra's books.<br />His familiarity with the underworld, however peripheral, shines through in &quot;Gangster.&quot; Yes, comparisons between Angelo Vestieri and Vito Corleone are inevitable, but they are different in significant ways, too.<br />&quot;Gangster&quot; is not &quot;The Godfather.&quot; Both are eloquent works on the mob oeuvre. &quot;Gangster&quot; is more panoramic, an epic that embraces not only a handful of flawed men and women on the margins of society, but their time and place, too. &quot;Gangster&quot; is a story of fathers and sons, not just godfathers and guns. It is a complex morality play in which the reader occasionally roots for the villains and frowns upon the good guys. Carcaterra knows the underworld's rhythms and philosophy as well as he knows its dirty streets, rain-slicked piers and smoke-filled social clubs.<br />Gangland is Carcaterra's country.epic that embraces not only a handful of flawed men and women on the margins of society, but their time and place, too. &quot;Gangster&quot; is a story of fathers and sons, not just godfathers and guns.

Iin life, in parable and in literature.<br />And he has returned once more in &quot;Gabriel's Story,&quot; a haunting debut by David Anthony Durham. In this incarnation, the wayward youth is a 15-year-old African-American boy in the empty middle of a continent, caught between youth and manhood, naivet&eacute; and wisdom, family and flight.<br />Fleeing racism in Reconstruction-era Baltimore, Gabriel Lynch travels with his mother and younger brother to his stepfather's hard-scrabble homestead in 1870s Kansas. As with the Biblical story of the prodigal son, Gabriel finds the &quot;outside&quot; world less exciting and more threatening than he dreamed. He returns to Kansas wiser and chastened, prepared to take his place behind the plow and, more importantly, at the family hearth. &quot;Gabriel's Story&quot; is a classical bildungsroman -- a novel about the moral and psychological growth of the main character -- told in masterful prose reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy.<br />His is not just a startlingly poetic African-American voice (Durham is the son of Trinidadian immigrants), but a welcome new voice in the rich spectrum of American letters, where authors should -- and must -- be judged in different shades of black and white: The color of words on a page.	2001-02-05

In the end, he seeks a world that is less dismaying and less complex, one where the &quot;endless project&quot; of generosity breeds peace and plenty. Man's primitively selfish and combative behavior, he says, is not only bad for the human race, it will ultimately destroy the Earth if unchecked. Kittredge's premise: Man has a moral and spiritual obligation to his planet and his memories to be kinder and gentler.<br />His poetic petition is both personal and panoramic. Its genesis is a 60-something writer's memory of childhood, of travels in diverse landscapes (and mindscapes) such as Montana, Venice, New York City, the heartbroken  Andalusian hills of Federico Garcia Lorca , and the French village of Les Crottes, where Nazis executed the entire population -- 17 souls -- in the desperate fury of defeat near the end of World War II. In the end, &quot;The Nature of Generosity&quot; is an eloquent philosophical treatise, a sublime travelogue and a visceral memoir of an Oregon boyhood that straddled the Depression and World War II, and it all grows from the taproot of sensual, but fleeting, images long lost.<br />On this journey through time and space, the reader is accompanied by eclectic companions: Pablo Neruda,  Piet Mondrian, Joseph Brodsky, Niccolo Machiavelli, Walt Whitman, Vladimir Nabokov, Mark Twain, Aristotle and Annie Dillard, among others. Others flash past like ghostly hitchhikers on dusky roadsides: Vance Valorida, a cowboy's cowboy who dies alone, or Oscar and Jo Kittredge, the author's own parents, whom he describes as &quot;secret radicals&quot; who simply forgot how to talk to each other.<br />Kittredge is at his lyrical best when exploring the place of storytelling  and the storytelling of place. To him, the future is mapped by stories.<br />Ambrose Bierce, a devilish writer who haunted the American West even before he disappeared into thin air, once said philosophy was a route of many roads leading from nowhere to nothing. But  &quot;The Nature of Generosity&quot; is a book of graceful rhythms, from one of America's most elegant writers in a place of extraordinary beauty. It aims toward a noble, if elusive, *something.* Kittredge has helped define a whole school of literature from the Interior West, but in this volume his place is clearly at the center of a world where the boundaries are not geographical, but emotional.e describes as &quot;secret radicals&quot; who simply forgot how to talk to each other. <br />Kittredge is at his lyrical best when exploring the place of storytelling  and the storytelling of place.

But Harrison, whose &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; established him as a master of the masculine retro-myth, didn't get there with Hemingway-esque bombast. His stories strip people -- particularly men --  to their intoxicating animal essence.<br />&quot;The Beast God Forgot to Invent&quot; is a collection of three novellas about humans and animals, about the effects of desire, dreams and death on men. Some of them dream of becoming bears, some walk away from civilization, some just go crazy. The characters are sometimes eminently joyless, other times staggeringly funny, but always only a coyote's howl from the animal inside.<br />&quot;The Beast God Forgot to Invent&quot; is pure Harrison, a bone-jarring gallop over the landscape of masculinity, and might be part of a new resurgence in the  novella form. His occasionally complex prose echoes Faulkner, but his voice is evocative and primal, without being beastly.	2000-11-20

Her characters are complex and common, some strong, some down-and-out, and the events in their lives are as momentous as the flapping of a butterfly's wings, which , of course, might change the course of history. And like waiting for history to unfold fully, the reader who expects to find resolution in these stories will wait forever.<br />These are women we know. Each of them wants something, maybe not much ... but something. A daughter who seeks her mother to deliver news of her estranged father's death, but finds a broken heart. A young mother has an epiphany about life and love at the very moment she delivers a child. An older woman who prefers younger men finds unexpected joy in an unlikely place. A lonely mother and wife in an Alaskan tour-fishing camp sees her flirtatious teen-age daughter as both a savior and a rival. A young nun vacations with her wild sister and learns about worship.<br />One such woman is Kit Ruckerson, the narrator of &quot;Aces.&quot; She's a bit of human flotsam drifting downstream in life. After an adult lifetime of wrong choices, she is marooned in bleak Bozeman, Mont., with her toddler son (fresh from a foster home) and her one-legged ne'er-do-well husband (fresh from jail after being busted for operating a meth lab in a horse barn). It's Thanksgiving, the family is destitute, sleeping in a borrowed garage and eating from a Salvation Army charity basket while Dad shares a few hits of hash with a buddy.<br />As Kit mooches for money from her mother, she feels like a she's &quot;locked in my life like a child in a closet.&quot; But she's hardly a sympathetic creature. She's merely coming to terms with the excesses of her life:<br />&quot; ... a woman does not find out who she'll be or what life will be like until she has a child. And for most women, having a child is like having all the windows in your house painted shut forever. Liberty is my oldest -- thirteen. She lives in Pocatello with her Dad, who's been through several reincarnations -- surfer, computer repairman, snowplow driver. Liberty was pure accident, as I believe so many babies are, even now.&quot;<br />It was &quot;Hummingbird House&quot; that established her as a rising literary star last year when it was a finalist for the National Book Award. The achievement was rare for two reasons: &quot;Hummingbird House&quot; was a first novel, and it was published by a small house, MacMurray &amp; Beck in Denver. (Perhaps even more remarkable, MacMurray &amp; Beck -- not one of the larger houses that tend to cherry-pick promising writers from independent houses -- will publish Henley's next full-length novel next year.)

Her characters are  titanically common folks engaged in a power struggle for love , independence, redemption and the future in a windswept, eastern Montana town. And her plot is as old as Genesis, or at least Milton's version of it: a fallen hellion who pursues an imperfect woman's heart and mind as a way to regain his equilibrium, while her virtuous husband struggles to understand and control the world around him.<br />But &quot;Winter Range&quot; is its own story, fresh and provocative. Ike Parsons is a small-town sheriff  with a reputation for fairness, common sense, and kindness, but an outsider whose roots haven't yet sunk deep enough in Montana's soil. Like most folks in town, he knows Chas Stubblefield has fallen on hard times in the bleak winter, but the profound horror of it doesn't come clear until he sees Stubblefield's ranch on a bitterly cold night: starving cattle and horses freezing where they stand, grotesque mounds of snow hiding the carcasses of the dead. When he returns in the light of day to offer help, he finds a brooding Stubblefield near bankruptcy, living off the meat of his dying herd, too angry to see a way out and too proud to accept help.<br />Chas is blinded to his own failings as a rancher. Bankers and suppliers have cut off his credit, and Chas's venom for them is poisoning his mind. &quot;Better to reign in Hell,&quot; Milton said in a passage favored by the troubled Chas, &quot;than to serve in Heaven.&quot; Between them is Pattiann Parsons, Ike's young, headstrong wife.  She's a local ranch girl with a rebellious streak and a promiscuous past, which includes a sexual relationship with Chas -- a small detail she's hidden from her husband. She sees neither a devil nor a saint in Chas, and while remaining loyal to her husband, she surrenders to a perverse, nostalgic compassion for her one-time lover. Embittered by her father's decision to cede the family ranch to her brother, Pattiann still has strong ties to the land -- and all the human conflicts that arise from it.<br />Davis's literary ethos rivals Larry Watson, Kent Haruf and Ivan Doig. And &quot;Winter Range&quot; might be an even more poetic example of the new Western literature, in which landscape, climate and the earth make an indelible mark upon the human character. Its vivid details -- nicks in the local tavern's bar from eager silver dollars, the warm numbness inflicted by a rifle's recoil against a man's shoulder, the stinking steam rising from a hungry coyote's mangy back --  prove Davis is a writer who both embraces and transcends the boundaries of Western regional literature.<br />Davis is earthy and as expansive as the Big Sky itself, but still poetic and evocative.l nor a saint in Chas, and while remaining loyal to her husband, she surrenders to a perverse, nostalgic compassion for her one-time lover.

But the savage  narrative isn't driven only by the body count nor the visceral horror in  his account of barbaric guerrilla warfare; what makes this book truly  horrific is the pure poetry and haunting beauty of Blake's writing.  This  is the richly re-imagined story of William Anderson, the real-life  bushwhacker prot&eacute;g&eacute; of William Quantrill, the ruthless sacker of Lawrence,  Kansas. For most of the Civil War, Quantrill commanded lawless,  Southern-sympathizing brigands whose mass murders, rapes and calculated  terror devastated pro-Union towns in the border states -- until he was  eclipsed by the living, gore-splashed myth who came to be known as Bloody  Bill Anderson.<br />Of course, historical fiction wouldn't succeed if it  didn't disturb the placid waters of  allegedly true history. Blake portrays  Anderson as a moral monster: a lover of dumb animals and poetry; a  cold-blooded guerrilla who questioned the massacre of civilians, but did  nothing to stop it; a principled leader of soulless pirate-warriors such as  Jesse and Frank James, and Cole Younger; a devoutly loyal son and brother;  a pathological hater of Yankees; even a handsome and gallant romantic who  marries a young prostitute because she reminds him of his spirited little  sister -- with whom he had a vaguely incestuous kinship.<br />Anderson's  famous 1864 raid on Centralia, Mo., is recounted in graphic detail,  reworked to blunt the razor-sharp edge of traditionally accepted accounts  of the terror he wrought. And by the time Bloody Bill is shot dead a few  months later, his bullet-riddled corpse photographed and desecrated by  Union troopers, the reader actually feels some sympathy for one of the most  prolific mass-murderers in American history.	2000-08-31

To the mother and son traveling together by car in the 1950s -- not on one trip but a series of trips over several  years -- Wyoming represents sanctuary. It's a place where one can hide and  never be found, where horses run in the open country and cool breezes blow,  a good place to have a dog.<br />But they never go. Instead, Roy and his  mother Kitty stick to the main roads, exploring swamps, roach-infested  motels, Civil War graveyards and greasy spoons on the Gulf Coast. The  purposes of their desultory journeys are not always clear, sometimes  hurtling toward a shabby liaison, sometimes unfolding in the slow  aimlessness of &quot;concertina locomotion.&quot; The reader seldom knows  the real destination, although the route always runs through an ambiguous  landscape of lost dreams and poignant hopes.<br />The 34 vignettes sketch the  bare outlines of Roy and Kitty, abandoned in Florida by an absent father  with apparent mob ties. Roy dreams of being a baseball player, or an  architect, or a fisherman; Kitty dreams of survival. *How* mother and son  survive is never known, although the reader can deduce that Kitty  occasionally leaves their various motel rooms at night.<br />The rhythms of  the conversation are remarkably true and, although a story told completely  in dialogue runs a very narrow gauge, the talk is keen and occasionally  deeply poetic, such as this moment when young Roy talks about the human  spirit:<br />&quot;Your soul flies away like a crow when you die and hides in  a cloud. When it rains that means the clouds are full of souls and some of  'em are squeezed out. Rain is the dead souls there's no more room for in  heaven.&quot;<br />&quot;Did Nanny tell you this, Roy?&quot;<br />&quot;No, it's  just something I thought.&quot;<br />&quot;Baby, there's no way I'll ever  think about rain the same way again.&quot;<br />In the end, Roy and his  mother speed past too quickly.

I am not an Indian War  buff, but I can tell you this book is chocked full of details and insights  that are not likely to be found collected in any other single volume.<br />The  book is broken down into logical chapters, from a description of the  Western troubles to the typical routines of the soldiers' discharges. We  are treated to what might be some of the last in-depth interviews with  Indian War veterans and, as has been pointed out, we begin to get a feel of  the frontier soldier's daily life as 99 percent boredom and physical labor  and 1 percent terror.<br />Many books have been written around the edges of  this subject, and several were awful in their historical value.

It divides the state into six distinct regions, then subdivides  those regions by major attractions, listing unique and interesting sights,  history, fun things for families, restaurants, lodging and more. The amount  of information is wide, but not deep.<br />My own town's listings, for  instance, aren't much different from most other guidebooks' listings. They  hit the high points in Gillette, Wyo., cursorily (Dalbey Fishing Lake,  McManamen Park, coal mines, golf, etc. Unfortunately, the new book lists  the closed Goings restaurant among the city's six eateries, even though the  Goings was closed long before the book came out -- and a new one opened  long after. And it touts the city pool as a great place for water sports,  but completely omits the Campbell County Recreation Center. Perhaps worse,  the only accommodations listed for Gillette are a single  bed-and-breakfast.<br />Sierra Adare, who lives part-time in Rawlins, is a  capable travel writer, and her &quot;Wyoming Guide&quot; is a good book to  pick up if you take family day-trips or like to give guidebooks to help  your out-of-state visitors ferret out interesting Wyoming places. It's  impossible to keep track of the marketplace in a state where businesses  come and go faster than January snowstorms, but there remain many sights  and travel resources that are often unlisted. So far, the elusive  comprehensive Wyoming guide book hasn't been written.	2000-06-23

During a month in Ireland, Cadogan's &quot;Ireland&quot; by Catharina Day (Globe Pequot Press, ......)was my constant travel companion, and I'd highly recommend the newest edition to anyone traveling in the Emerald Isle.<br />The book  contains excellent maps, historical perspectives, a guide to the politics,  historic chronology, Gaelic language, geology, myths and legends, and  religious complexities of this beautiful country. It also has a fairly  hefty section on practical travel advice tailored specifically to the Irish  traveler.<br />The book is divided into very logical sections, and information  is generally easy to find in its rather comprehensive index. Best of all,  the island is divided naturally in this guide into its four regions --  Munster, Connacht, Ulster and Leinster -- so the traveler needn't thumb  through the whole book to find things that might be one mile apart. It is  further divided county by county, and travel is laid out very nicely and  clearly, in the order you would see it by car. I found only minor errors,  none that would have significantly changed my travel plans for the day and  none that might not have been the effect of changing markets and  seasons.<br />I often would read this guide in bed at night, it's so  well-written, entertaining and informative. I would highly recommend this  book to the American traveler in Ireland. It's complete, funny and quite  educational.	2000-06-22

The final destination isn't always geographical, but is often a state of mind,  of self-worth or of sheer will. And all along the way are places where  folks have stopped to catch their breath or gather their wits before moving  on to whatever waits at the end of the line.<br />Such is the place explained  in &quot;Mountain City.&quot;<br />On the first page of Gregory Martin's  atmospheric memoir, only 33 people still live in Mountain City, just a  ragged shred of civilization in remote northeastern Nevada, like a scrap of  old newspaper stubbornly clinging to a sagebrush. The town's mining heydays  -- and there are a few -- are the stuff of both memories and dreams,  &quot;a Western archetype for hope and failed hope and  failure&quot;:<br />Less spiritual than &quot;Dakota&quot; by Kathleen Norris  and more desolate than &quot;The Meadow&quot; by James Galvin,  &quot;Mountain City&quot; celebrates the alternate Western seasons of  promise and pessimism, arrival and abandonment. Hardened like the place he  sketches against the vagaries of life, Martin writes sensitively without  being maudlin, as if pity were something he discovered late in life.<br />He  finds beauty in the abandoned shacks of Mountain City, courage in the  elderly people who stay in Mountain City and trust the cycle of prosperity  to come 'round one more time. And he sees wisdom in the temporary and  mobile, like the trailers that come and go with the capricious fortunes of  time and place:<br />Mountain City, the town, is unlikely to survive our  lifetime, but this book preserves it (and other places like it) forever in  the collective conscience, like a road sign pointing the way to a place and  a state of mind that no longer exist.	2000-06-15

More importantly, Banks has freely revised many of  the old stories, so even his most ardent fans can expect to see something  new.<br />His stories are elegantly postmodern, beautiful and striking, full  of diverse voices and disquietingly vulgar settings. Some are only a few  pages long; others go deeper and longer. But many of his stories, though  sometimes suffocatingly bleak, are also capable of poignant humor and broad  satire.<br />Perhaps the renaissance of the short story that finally elevates  Banks to his proper place among American writers. He ranks with John  Cheever as one of the masters of the contemporary form, if not in  name-recognition.	2000-06-14

His routine is simple: McMurtry flies someplace, rents a car and drives  home to lonesome Archer City, Texas. On his dawn-to-dusk superhighway  sojourns, never slowing down for three-calendar diners, tourist traps or  even to visit friends, he won't even turn on the radio. The journey itself  is his destination. It's about going, not stopping.<br />At a level as  uncomplicated as a farm-to-market road, the highways of McMurtry's  collection are merely threads binding together his diverse musings on Los  Angeles, manifest destiny, Hemingway's furniture, the need for  rattlesnakes, the callowness (and shallowness) of contemporary Hollywood,  cowboys, young killers in the Heartland, old books, fatherhood, the yellow  housepaint in Key Largo, great rivers, the Holy Tortilla, and short  remembrances of several dead characters from his stories. His prose has the  quality of conversation on a long, long drive: a meandering, intimate,  unfettered discourse inspired by the passing landscape.<br />But in a larger  sense, &quot;Roads&quot; is a metaphor for the circular journey of  McMurtry's life.  It leads him to, from and through places where he  considered roads not taken, or where his personal or literary paths crossed  others, or simply where the quality of light through his windshield  illuminated a memory.<br />&quot;Roads&quot; can be read as a natural sequel  to &quot;Walter Benjamin&quot;: The boy who never read Hemingway or  Faulkner until he went to college now takes to the open road as a man to  ponder their legacies -- and his own.	2000-06-13

Tragically, he emerged from the Boer War safely, but was  executed for his role in the 1916 Easter Uprising and his body dumped in a  mass grave with several of his patriotic comrades. His sacrifices certainly  helped lay the foundation for Ireland's freedom.<br />This book focuses mainly  on MacBride's service in the Boer War, the politics and passions of the  Irish involvement, and his relationship with the flamboyant Maud Gonne, who  bore his two children. MacBride is not a perfect hero, which makes him (and  this book)all the more engaging.<br />Dr. McCracken's book is well-wrought  history, finely detailed and comprehensively researched. It is also a darn  good story, well told. He's a devoted scholar and historian, and a fine  writer. I would recommend this work highly to any student of Irish  republicanism and/or the Boer War.	2000-06-10

But the book itself, intentionally or not, is a unique  artifact of Western consciousness and environment. Its moments of lyric  natural beauty -- and there are many -- are occasionally obscured by  old-fashioned doctrinaire preachiness, like the ageless mountains behind  Denver's brown cloud. Something funny happened on the way to the ranch, and  we have forgotten that the now-romanticized ranchers and cowboys who  settled this country were, in many ways, no less exploitive and ambitious  than the developers who have now replaced railroad barons as the bad guys  in regional fiction. It wasn't all that long ago that the bad guys in our  stories were the guys who built fences and shot sheepherders. The landscape  of Western literature doesn't change, only the good guys and the bad  guys.<br />kay, it's a lot easier to mourn the loss of Western culture than  the throttling of the two-dimensional bad guy Merriweather Snipes, but  Galvin takes the melodrama to an extreme: The &quot;good&quot; guy -- in  this case, a murderer -- ultimately faces no social consequence for his  law-breaking. True, it's a book about violence and greed, but it justifies  almost anything as long as the land is protected. And there's a paper-thin  line between passion and rage. The malignant Snipes never breaks the law,  he just has values (admittedly reptilian) that collide with Mike Arans's.  The West is wild, to be sure, but do we really want to believe that  violence in the service of one man's sense of virtue is  permissible?<br />Galvin's &quot;The Meadow&quot; was one of the most  beautiful and enchanting books to be written in or about the West in the  past 10 years, and is arguably among the three best books about Wyoming  ever. &quot;Fencing the Sky&quot; is just the latest in the burgeoning  genre of Western literature exploring the delicate relationship between  landscape and how it suffers modern human activity. Ivan Doig's  &quot;Mountain Time&quot; and Larry McMurtry's memoir, &quot;Walter  Benjamin at the Dairy Queen,&quot; are sturdier explorations of the state  of the Western landscape, but neither captures the poetic puzzle of the  place as well as Galvin.ten in or about the West in the  past 10 years, and is arguably among the three best books about Wyoming  ever. &quot;Fencing the Sky&quot; is just the latest in the burgeoning  genre of Western literature exploring the delicate relationship between  landscape and how it suffers modern human activity.

The notes and other addenda  helped shape the story even further for me, leaving it perhaps more  fascinating for the wonder of what Fitzgerald might have done had he not  died so young.

I was a high school kid in the early 1970s, working on my campus newspaper, newly graduated from Jack London but not yet ready for Jack Kerouac.<br />To  my young eyes, it was a good action story:  Robert Jordan, the passionate  American teacher joins a band of armed gypsies in the Spanish Civil War.  He believes one man can make a difference.  The whole novel covers just 68  hours, during which Jordan must find a way to blow up a key bridge behind  enemy lines.  In that short time, Jordan also falls in love with Maria, a  beautiful Spanish woman who has been raped by enemy soldiers.  The whole  spectrum of literature was refracted through the prism of my youth: Good  guys and bad guys, sex and blood, life and death.  For me, just a boy, the  journey from abstraction to clarity was only just beginning.<br />Re-reading  &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; at 42 (roughly the age Hemingway was  when he published it), I have lost my ability to see things clearly in  black and white.  My vision is blurred by irony, as I note that two  enemies, the moral killer Anselmo and the sympathetic fascist Lieutenant  Berrendo, utter the very same prayer.  For the first time, I see that the  book opens with Robert Jordan lying on the &quot;pine-needled floor of the  forest&quot; and closes as he feels his heart pounding against the  &quot;pine needle floor of the forest&quot;; Jordan ends as he begins,  perhaps having never really moved.  I certainly could never have seen at 16  how dying well might be more consequential than living well.  And somehow  the light has changed in the past 26 years, so that I now truly understand  how the earth can move.<br />As a teen, I missed another crucial element, even  though Vietnam was still a seeping wound.  Three pivotal days in Jordan's  life force him to question his own role in a futile war.  He wonders if  dying for a political cause might be too wasteful, but he ultimately  believes that dying to save another individual is a man's most heroic act.<br />The book's title is taken from John Donne's celebrated poem: &quot;No  man is an Iland ... and therefore never send to know for whom the bell  tolls; It tolls for thee.&quot; It was not about loneliness and aloneness,  as I once had thought, but about the seamless fabric of all life:  What  happens to one happens to all.<br />I am not blind to Hemingway's flaws.  He  was a good short writer, and what was short was almost always better.  Pilar's tale on the mountainside has been widely acclaimed as the most  powerful of Hemingway's prose.  Her story within a story is nothing less  than a contemporary myth.<br />&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; has also  been regarded as Hemingway's capitulation to critics who barked that his  innovative style was too lean, and as a consciously commercial exercise for  which Hollywood might (and did) pay handsomely.  Robert Jordan, in so many  respects, was a tragic mythical hero in the vein of Achilles, Gawain and  Samson.  &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; ranks as one of the great  American war novels in a country that has always struggled with the concept  of good and bad wars.he ultimately  believes that dying to save another individual is a man's most heroic act.  <br />The book's title is taken from John Donne's celebrated poem: &quot;No  man is an Iland ... and therefore never send to know for whom the bell  tolls; It tolls for thee.&quot; It was not about loneliness and aloneness,  as I once had thought, but about the seamless fabric of all life:  What  happens to one happens to all. <br />I am not blind to Hemingway's flaws.

This debut doesn't herald  a new voice as much as it heralds the discovery of an older voice by a new  young writer, and the effect is mixed.<br />&quot;Stop Breakin Down&quot; is a  difficult book to read. McManus, only 22, has made the beginning writer's  mistake of elevating form over function. Perplexing, page-long paragraphs  and minimal punctuation obscure his real narrative message and punch. His  refusal to use quotation marks to separate dialogue from the rest of his  prose is, in this case, an affectation that ultimately only confuses the  reader.<br />A lot of bohemian ink has been spilled in the name of post-modern  literature, some of it quite good, from Barth to Pynchon. But when straying  from the linear, Grand Narrative style, &quot;pomo&quot; writers not only  run the usual risk of bad writing, but the peculiar risk of being  incoherent, too. McManus isn't incoherent, but he also has not exploited  the pumping, streaming, raging rhythms of post-modern writing to their full  effect.<br />What is the author's intent when he diverges from the conventions  of literature? Who knows, and who cares? The text itself is the thing, and  a reader should not dawdle about a writer's intentions. The story speaks  for itself, or it doesn't. The hallmarks of post-modern work -- anarchy,  radicalism, sarcasm and raw nerve -- sometimes provide the illusion of high  art, but in literature, the real art is the message and it should at least  be digestible and clear, no matter the style.	2000-05-29

Empty at heart and yearning for a family of her own after  bearing a child for her sister, the pudgy Rosie swirls over an Atlantic  rainbow and lands in a new world where she works for the Tivot family on  their Parisian houseboat. While the children welcome her eagerly, she  immediately chills in the shadow of Nicole, their remote but urbane mother.  From the outset, Rosie is made more vulnerable by her halting grasp of  French.<br />King brings alive a palette of colorful and robust characters  that might have been collected from an afternoon at a sidewalk cafe in  Provence. Their faces are sweetly familiar. If there's a fault in the tale,  it is Rosie's seemingly dispassionate voice. Gyrating in a maelstrom of  emotions and new sensual experiences, confronting new and old ghosts, Rosie  is as austere in her storytelling as we imagine Nicole to be in her  mothering. Of course, Rosie comes to understand that Nicole and she are not  so different after all, but they are not, in any sense, the same.Still,  this is a rich first novel about families lost and found from a promising  writer with an ear for the kind of language -- language from the heart --  that touches deeply.	2000-05-26

In this sweeping  yet precise epic, Ball has created a swashbuckler for urbane readers.  Ball's voice recalls, by turns, Michener and Clavell, Sir Richard Burton,  and even Alexander Dumas. As a narrative, &quot;Empires of Sand&quot; is  part &quot;Beau Geste,&quot; part &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot;<br />He  blends actual historic events and details with his engaging fiction.

Their impending extinction, he argues, would not only damage the  world's ecology, but also our collective imagination.<br />&quot;Tigers in the  Snow&quot; is more analytical and less lyrical (and far less introspective)  than &quot;The Snow Leopard.&quot; Mattheissen's fans will find  &quot;Tigers&quot; comparable to his 1992 book, &quot;African  Silences,&quot; a sobering account of the catastrophic depredation of the  African landscape and its wildlife, particularly elephants. Indeed, as with  many ecological calamities-in-the-making, the causes of the Asian tiger's  decline -- hunting, reduction of food supply, man's encroachment and  government policies (or lack of them) -- tragically resembles the majestic  African elephant's deterioration.	2000-05-26

McMurtry writes poignantly -- occasionally humorously -- about  his own cloistered childhood, spent largely in fear of shrubbery and  poultry, and his surprising distaste for the cowboy life. He is most  eloquent when writing about his own passion for reading and books, two  entirely different subjects for a man who is not only a prolific writer and  reader, but also a rare book dealer and collector.<br />In the end,  &quot;Walter Benjamin ...&quot; is about growing up and growing old.  McMurtry slyly weaves his personal story with the story of an ripening  frontier that has been washed by repeated waves of people, ideas and  industries, but survived. The Western small town -- whether it's the  fictional Thalia or his real hometown of Archer City, or any of a thousand  others -- is losing some of its dreams, but goes to sleep each night hoping  for new dreams to come along. For those towns and their people, the future  is a frontier all its own, with its own vagaries and vicissitudes. For  McMurtry, too.	2000-05-26

As you cruise the blue highways from Washington to  Florida, Fergus muses about hunters' patient wives, sharptail grouse,  bamboo fly-rods, the coming of snow, bonefishing, Native American culture,  lives worth living, the perils facing small towns, good dogs and good  friends. There's a certain poetry that emanates from somewhere deep down,  an echo of a primitive time, brought up-to-date by Airstream trailers,  Coleman grills and, for better or worse, Eddie Bauer.<br />This is a good book  for non-hunters and non-anglers, the most militant of whom assume avid  sportsmen have little conscience or intellect. Fergus proves otherwise. He  is an eloquent spokesman for the sporting life, not defensive and clearly  thoughtful. If you've ever wanted to understand the allure of frigid  mornings in high-plains cornfields, or soggy nights on the banks of an  unknown river, or why a hunter would drive for two days for a fleeting  glimpse of a bird too small for dinner on its own, read &quot;The Sporting  Road.&quot;	2000-05-26

One glance at the jacket of George Saunders's new story collection, &quot;Pastoralia&quot; -- a plastic deer chained to a light post, with a  thought-bubble containing a caveman -- and you know this is a seriously  peculiar book and maybe an arrestingly original writer.<br />He might be  bizarre, but Saunders's first book, &quot;CivilWarLand in Bad  Decline,&quot; was a finalist for the 1996 PEN/Hemingway Award and a New  York Times Notable Book. He's won three O. Henry Awards,  two National  Magazine Awards, and The New Yorker lists the Syracuse creative-writing  professor among the 20 best American fiction writers under 40 -- all  potentially a blessing or a curse to a writer who has a bright future  spitting on media-driven appetites.<br />But, just like in  &quot;Pastoralia,&quot; anti-heroes abound, even thrive, in the underbelly  of modern America.

In Eire, the past is passion and even the newest landmark looks like the oldest place you ever saw.<br />And Roddy Doyle captures the melodic  cacophony of Irish history, passion and appetite in his new novel, &quot;A  Star Called Henry.&quot; It is narrated by Henry Smart, who takes us  through his first 20 years, from his birth into Dublin's savage poverty in  1901 through the romance of his naive young mother and one-legged alcoholic  father.<br />The real ghosts of Ireland's rebellion drift in the background  of this novel, providing harmony to Henry's fictional life. The heady  passions of Dublin and the quirks of its people are spun into the yarn so  deftly the reader will actually hear a brogue in Doyle's dialogue. It's  funny and moving at the same time, an Irish peculiarity. But it is also an  immense story about a small island where ghosts walk among the living, just  as Henry Smart walks among us, real as a Dublin fog.	2000-05-11

That's why the Hallorans don't believe in luck and certainly won't risk any more than they've already stolen.<br />Set in Hawaii  in 1971, &quot;Gambler's Rose&quot; is an anything-but-tender story about a  family of card sharps. Trained almost from birth to beat every mark,  Charlie and Reggie Halloran can read almost anyone at a glance -- except  their father, Music Halloran, a one-eyed professional cheat who has called  them together for a game that could ensure they'd never have to cheat at  cards again.<br />Of course, one of Music's grandest lessons for his  double-dealing sons was:  No game they'll ever play is an honest game. And  the endgame he's contemplating will be anything but fair.<br />In 13 chapters  of &quot;Gambler's Rose&quot;-- perhaps a salute to Music Halloran's belief  that nothing is accidental -- Hawkes deals a full-house of high-stakes  poker and higher-stakes love, and how a player determines the risks worth  taking. The card games themselves are occasionally difficult to visualize,  but one needn't be a poker player to grasp the essence of Hawkes's message:  Maybe the only games worth winning -- including life -- can't be  manipulated.<br />Poker clearly isn't a new literary metaphor for life, but  few have done it with Hawkes's technical precision.	2000-05-10

And like the brawny Missouri, Doig has channeled three deep literary  tributaries into &quot;Mountain Time,&quot; a coda to his McCaskill family  trilogy.<br />Three people, three intense relationships, three rivers.  &quot;Mountain Time&quot; is the confluence: The very real familial clash  between Lyle and Mitch echoes the clash between the historic and  contemporary West, where exploitation has always been at odds with  environmental anxiety.<br />&quot;Mountain Time&quot; will not dissuade those  who rank Doig among the best living American writers, and one might even  begin making comparisons to some of the best *dead* ones, too. Faulkner  comes most readily to mind: The Snopeses of Yoknapatawpha County are no  more troubled and no more human than the McCaskills of the Two Medicine  country in Montana. Two great rivers in different landscapes.	2000-05-10

So it is with Mark Spragg's  &quot;Where Rivers Change Direction,&quot; a collection of essays about  Spragg's adolescence as the son of a dude rancher in a half-tamed part of  Wyoming where men have christened streams with names such as Sunlight, Mist  and Cloudburst.<br />Spragg's collection isn't about water, but about  growing up, not only as the son of a wilderness dude-ranch operator, but  also as a working-hand in the family business. From the one-room school in  Wapiti, Wyo., to the Crossed Sabers Ranch bunkhouse where he sleeps with  the other hired hands, Spragg paints a vivid portrait of life in the  American Outback.<br />A new, lyric literature of the West is beginning to  trickle out of the high places toward the flatland, and Spragg's finely  wrought essays are easily equal to much of the beautiful fiction that is  beginning to define the region's connections between the living land and  the ever-changing self. In this book, a river runs through a heart.  For  men and water, one stream becomes another and a little more about our Earth  is revealed.	2000-05-10

Unfortunately, it's a happy ending that doesn't happen.<br />So much  for sympathizing with characters. But Stuart deftly guides us through the  celebrity-obsessed Manhattan swirl (where his friendliest figure is a savvy  literary agent) and the media mayhem (where the worst thing that can happen  to a writer is a snippy review in the *New York Times.*) He stuffs the tale  with enough name-dropping and publishing-insider details to give it  authenticity, and certainly doesn't glamorize the shallow little world his  characters occupy.<br />The fact is, &quot;The Mentor&quot; is a pleasing  entertainment, occasionally witty and completely accessible. Okay, so you  secretly hope these characters find a way to pull off a spectacular  three-way murder. In the standard version, all inflated with heroic  happysmoke, they would. But it doesn't happen, so by definition, &quot;The  Mentor&quot; has an unexpected ending. That's just part of the thrill.	2000-05-10

And that might mean, um, you are Custer.<br />Or it might just mean  Alexie wants you to understand the pride and rage behind these nine  lyrical, rebellious, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking stories,  where Indians find themselves between worlds, between lives, and between  loves.<br />Fiction writers simulate real life, they don't really bottle it.  Alexie is one of the best American writers of any color today, but not  because he writes about Indians as an Indian. Rather, it's because he  observes the multi-colored light of *human* existence through indigenous  eyes. His prism is a valuable cultural artifact on this reservation we call  America.	2000-05-09
US	51381608	R29MEXV7FXFYKE	067084134X	855770597	Ravelstein	Books	4	39	44	N	N	Another masterful example of art imitating life	For the past 50 years, Nobel laureate Saul Bellow has been perfecting the *roman &agrave; clef* -- a novel in which real people or actual events are portrayed in fictional disguise. But what should we call a memoir in  fictional disguise?<br />Bellow's latest novel, &quot;Ravelstein,&quot; is a  thinly fictionalized character sketch of his late friend Allan Bloom, a  rakish classical scholar who wrote (at Bellow's suggestion) &quot;The  Closing of the American Mind&quot; (1987). But &quot;Ravelstein&quot; --  the &quot;novel&quot; -- is also the story of a relationship between two  men: Abe Ravelstein, an intellectual who becomes a best-selling author, and  Chick, an older writer who suggested Ravelstein's treatise on human nature  and the narrator of this story. Five years after Ravelstein dies of AIDS,  Chick faces the consuming task of writing a biography of the complex don,  whose outsized appetites for Hermes ties, Armani suits, and Cuban cigars  rival his esoteric fascination with Rousseau, Machiavelli and Plato.<br />Why  fictionalize this real-life friendship between two larger-than-life figures  in American culture? Only Bellow knows. Fictionalizing the story of Allen  Bloom might have allowed Bellow more flexibility with an intricate, humanly  inconsistent subject. Or it might simply have been Bellow's way of  exceeding the natural bounds of novel structure. To be sure,  &quot;Ravelstein&quot; swells with all the irony and artistry with which  Bellow has imbued his earlier novels. &quot;Ravelstein&quot; taken *in  situ* slides gracefully along it. It will stand among the best *writing* of  his long career.<br />Still, &quot;Ravelstein&quot; is deeper than the words  on the page, like a ghostly image seen beneath the surface of water. Bellow  blunts the impact of Bloom's character and life by labeling it as fiction.  The lesson of a real life retold burns brighter than a memoir masquerading  as a fable.	2000-05-01

And the gadget just might  be the real star of this traumatic new thriller.<br />Like Robin Cook,  Michael Palmer writes vastly popular novels about doctors in crises,  including &quot;Natural Causes,&quot; a 1994 best seller; &quot;Silent  Treatment&quot; (1995); and &quot;Critical Judgment&quot; (1996).  &quot;The Patient&quot; might be his most riveting book yet, leaving hardly  enough time to take a breath.<br />After all, it is brain surgery.	2000-04-20

Without the Battle of San  Jacinto, Texas could not have existed. Without Texas, westward expansion  would have been stymied. Without the West, the U.S. would merely be an  Atlantic power, at best, and would not likely have risen to a world power.  And without the U.S. as a world power, the world as we know it today would  not exist.<br />So there is no surprise that a gifted Texas writer such as  Stephen Harrigan would return to the touchstone of this single, epochal  event to tell a riveting new story, in much the same way writers have so  often returned to the story of Creation.<br />This book is a new masterpiece  in the literature of fact. The strength of Harrigan's extraordinarily  authentic novel is in its superior storytelling, no small thing when  staring down the hot barrel of history.	2000-04-18

Larsgaard offers an  insider's primer on the murky world of skip-tracers and other people who  hunt for humans. And just when you thought it was safe to send your credit  card number to an allegedly &quot;secure&quot; Web site, Larsgaard serves  up about a hundred more sinister reasons you shouldn't even talk to another  human being for the rest of your life if you truly value your  privacy.<br />&quot;The Heir Hunter&quot; is original and cool. Larsgaard's  debut is a masterly bit of suspense writing.	2000-04-12

In outlaw hagiography, he is surely the darkest angel. Now, &quot;The Chivalry of Crime,&quot; an impressive first novel by Desmond Barry about the unholy  terror of Jesse James, allows readers to touch the very root of violence in  human nature and explore the American fascination with outlaws<br />Barry, a  Welsh immigrant fascinated by the fantastic tales of the American West, bit  off a huge hunk of frontier mythology and chewed it fairly thoroughly. As a  new work of &quot;re-imagined&quot; history, &quot;The Chivalry of  Crime&quot; is perhaps not as literarily weighty as Stephen Harrigan's  &quot;Gates of the Alamo,&quot; nor as quirky as Cormac McCarthy's  &quot;Blood Meridian,&quot; although Barry is a writer of equally enormous  talent. The book's flaws are rather minor and technical, and it remains an  entertaining historical yarn.	2000-04-11

Highly stylistic prose reflects the stream of human  consciousness, where sometimes a leaf floats past and we think we recognize  it as a leaf that floated past a year before. Dermot Healy's &quot;Bend for  Home&quot; is part &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; and part  &quot;Angela's Ashes,&quot; combining the ambient grey of Irish poverty  with characteristic Irish humor.<br />Healy has been criticized for betraying  his mother's memory in the book's sometimes hilarious, sometimes wrenching  last chapter. But it is one of the most touching accounts of a son and  mother's last days together since I read Mark Spragg's &quot;Where Rivers  Change Direction.&quot; What would make his mother proud is knowing that  Healy has become one of the first rank of Irish authors, and his account of  her decline is a sad, beautiful piece of work.<br />Healy should be more  widely read in America, if only because his is an original voice in a new  key, Irish accent or not.	2000-04-05

Billman's characters are marginal and marginalized, caught in a range war between the  the herd-fear of conformity and a place that demands robust individuality.  People molded by their surroundings, both geographic and spiritual. As a  Wyoming writer, I found its tone pitch-perfect. Recommended.	1999-08-08

My perpective ... both as a  man and a writer 100 years later ... was greatly expanded by the stories  she tells.  For my own purposes, I had hoped for more detail about the  day-to-day life of these women, but I still found an enormous amount of  anecdotal information that suddenly made these women of &quot;negotiable  virtue&quot; more human.<br />&quot;Soiled Doves&quot; is rare as a readable,  interesting and generally well researched history. Mrs. Seagraves  occasionally gets carried away with some interior perspectives that would  rankle historical purists, but as a casual reader I was enlightened and  entertained.	1999-05-26

Her characters are straight out of the lives of any reader who grew up in a small town and yearned to leave ... then  yearned as genuinely to return. Yet, this isn't a melodramatic nostalgia  book that casts youth in the patina of perfection, and it isn't a book for  the most devout among us who literally accept as gospel what they are told  in church, without troubling their own hearts and minds for more personal  answers.  &quot;The Last One Home&quot; is funny, irreverent, sad,  troubling, profound, rhythmic and completely readable. There's a touch of  Anne Lamott here, some Annie Dillard, some Jacqueline Mitchard ... but  mostly the reader can expect a unique new voice from a fresh woman writer  who strikes me as confident, sensitive and thoughtful. I strongly recommend  this book to mature readers who can grasp some of the deeper complexities  of a middle-aged woman's balancing act. It's a refreshing piece of artful  literature that should soon find its place.	1999-03-10

His attention to the facts in the true crime only  make this story more appealing. He has played fairly with the reader by  offering his fictional alternative explanation, to the point where I  momentarily considered John Wilkes Booth in an entirely new light.<br />Leppek  captures the rhythms of Arthur Conan Doyle admirably. Holmes's American  fans (and fans of the number of Holmes knock-offs this century) should love  this story. And before it is classified as merely a mindless mystery  entertainment, it should be appreciated for its expertly handled message  (properly posed by a contemporary journalist): History is not always what  it seems.<br />Good work, Chris. &quot;The Surrogate Assassin&quot; gave me  several hours of pleasureable and challenging reading.	1999-02-25
