As a long time vegetarian with two small children, I'm always looking for ways to make good healthy veggie coooking \\"family friendly\\".  This cookbook succeeds marvellously!  In a few short months the pages have become well loved--the tahini dressing is now a staple in our fridge, the mushroom/wild rice soup (vegan, at that!) in much demand in the winter months.  I have yet to make something that didn't turn out delicious!<br /><br />Haedrich has an enjoyably readable style, and the anecdotes about his children's likes and dislikes and family traditions make this a \\"read it cover to cover\\" cookbook.  There are plenty of suggestions about how to modify recipes for picky kids (perish the thought!), or how to perk up the same recipe to make it more \\"grown up\\".  I love the author's understanding of what it is really like to cook with a family--no pristine test kitchen recipes here.<br /><br />If you are looking for delicious, hearty, healthy and kid-friendly dishes, this is an absolute gem!	2005-02-13

Hilarious and refreshingly erudite take on American history and government.  The more knowledge you have of the events and systems covered, the more you will enjoy this highly tongue-in-cheek parody.  How wonderful that a popular humorist like Jon Stewart has embraced the idea that educated and informed people like to laugh as well.  Highly recommended to all those who don't believe historical irreverence is a sin, or that humor must come with an explanatory guide book--as some reviewers apparently do.	2004-10-22

I didn't find the book a difficult read, per se (admittedly, I'm on of those who love Umberto Eco), but simply found the prose overly dry, the characters not compelling, and the plot nonexistant.  While admittedly a plot isn't necessary to a great book, it would help with the pacing of what looks to be a 3000 page work--particularly from an author who has a gift for complex plotting.<br />In general I love reading history, although mostly nonfiction, but somehow the highly detailed and microscopically rendered descriptive text fell flat for me.  I forced myself to finish it, only to wish I was one of those who can so easily toss aside a book they've invested hours in already. It seems to be an either/or proposition--love it or hate it--so I suggest a quick perusal of the text before you invest $30 in a book you may be less than thrilled with.	2003-10-16

My son loves this book so much I can do the whole thing from beginning to end in my sleep... the pictures are wonderful, bright and full of detail.  Lots of animals to name, objects that begin with the appropriate letter are incorporated into each page, and the people depicted are multicultural.  The text is alliterative and rhythmic (NOT rhyming,as one of the print reviews says), and really captures the movement of jazz.<br />The recommended age is 5-9, but my son has been in love with this book since he was 12 months old.  He's 15 months now, and still demands it upwards of 10 times a day.  He loves to find the kitty cat and the little boy that are found on every page of the book (except one) and will clap his hands with the rythym.<br />I just pray our copy will last for more than a year... this book is really getting a workout in our house.<br />Read it in your best \\"blues man\\" voice, and you've got a winner for any preschooler!

It is clearly written, would be a great focus for an adult Sunday School class, and uses terminology that even the theologically uneducated can comprehend.  Not a lot of theology books are page turners that can be read in one sitting, but this one is (at just over 200 clearly written pages).  Then you go back for more.<br />How do we think about organizations or nations that do bad things?  What are the real demons of the world?  Why do wars occur?  What is the theory behind nonviolence, and why should Christians understand it?  Wink takes some broad, deep and meaningful issues and manages to make cogent arguments in short, simple terminology.  I particularly found his discussion of \\"just war\\" theology to be helpful.<br />This is one that I'll refer to again and again as I write sermons and do my own theological discernment.  Every pastor should own it, and I highly recommend it to lay persons as well.	2003-03-26

Henry Morton is one of the most engaging and well characterized detectives in historical fiction today.  A Bow Street Runner at the turn of the 19th century, Morton catches criminals for reward money--a somewhat unsavory profession in this time before Scotland Yard.  From the peek behind the stage door as Morton trades repartee with his mistress, to the real-life corruption of Bow Street, to the snapshot of the uglier side of the criminal classes... The Thief Taker is a deftly written historical mystery with a great ending.  Highly recommended.	2003-03-26

I first read Foucoult's Pendulum back in college when it was first published.  It was recommended by my bofriend, and I spent half of Spring Break plowing through it.  Hard work.  One of the few books that absolutely necessitates having a dictionary at hand to really absorb it, and it better be the OED because Webster's doesn't have all the words. Seriously. And in the end, I was floored, absorbed, and used the remaining days of vacation to read it again.  I had found a new \\"Favorite Book Ever!\\"<br /><br />I guess I understand why so many are so full of vitriolic loathing when they discuss \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\".  It isn't really a thriller, nor a consipiracy theory text, nor a philosophical treatise, nor an easy read.  If you really want some brain candy (and I certainly do a lot of the time--PG Wodehouse forever!) this is not the book to pick up.<br /><br />It was, however, probably the first work of fiction I had ever read that made me think about the nature of reality... what is real, what is knowledge, how do we know and who decides. I loved the historical mind games, the twisted conspiracy plots, the flights of fanciful speculation.  I found the language dense, yes, but dense like the best kind of rich, dark, brownies--intense and flavorful.  For me the climax of the novel had nothing to do with the plot, it was the moment when I went \\"ah-ha!\\" and actually \\"Got It!\\"  An intellectual pleasure in the extreme, but a genuine joy nonetheless.<br /><br />Twelve years later I own three copies of this book (my tattered original paperback, a hardcover I've read once because I felt this was a book I wanted to own in hardcover, and another paperback for lending out).  I've read \\"Foucault\\" three additional times... it would be more, but, as I said, it's a tough read and you have to be in the right mood.  Every time I've experienced again that first wonderful \\"Ah-ha!\\" moment, though perhaps a little less intense since I know it is coming. The boyfriend who recommended it is now my husband.  And hundreds of books later, it's still my favorite book.ds of books later, it's still my favorite book.	2003-03-02

And you know what?  Never has one said \\"I wish I had spent more time at work\\", or \\"My life would have been complete if I had got that promotion.\\"  Nope.  They talk about words of love unsaid, words of anger they wish they could unsay, time that should have been spent with their kids and family that they wasted on chasing an ephemeral ideal of 'success'.<br />In Living a Life that Matters, Kushner has given us a timely examination of why it is that so many in our culture spend their valuable time striving for a culturally defined success that doesn't really matter, and how to reevaluate and reorient for a meaningful life.  Kushner's wonderful stories and examples, as well as clear entertaining writing make this a gem.  It's easy to read, and as deep as the night sky.<br />If you are a person with an unsettled feeling in your soul, wondering what your life really means after all, Kushner's book is a great place to start looking for answers.	2002-06-05

She's funny as she mocks everyone who disagrees with her style of child rearing. She's funny as she explains how VERY unhappy you will be after giving birth. She's funny as she reminds you time and again that men are only useless sperm donors(as the back cover of her book says so clearly, \\"Husband, what husband?\\"), so don't expect the father to get off the couch for you.  Basically, she's funny as she describes how very miserable your child will make you.<br />My son is five months old, and I love being a Mom.  I did natural childbirth--hey, it's not for everyone, but Ms. McCarty thinks that means I'm some kind of freak.  I love spending time with my son.  Some people get the baby blues, but according to her if you don't hate life within three hours of labor, you aren't really a \\"Girlfriend\\".  My husband is a fantastic father, who not only changes more diapers than I do (*gasp*) but actually takes fathering seriously, and was an invaluable support for me during the postpartum recovery period.  Since he's not a jerk, I can't be a \\"Girlfriend\\".<br />If you are having a very difficult time adjusting to motherhood, if your partner is an unsupportive clod... it should make you feel better.  If you are struggling and overwhelmed and ready to take most of what she says with a large grain of salt, it might cheer you up.  It is NOT a good read if you want to remain positive about your first child entering your life.<br />Vicki Iovine is an expert, has a monthly column in Child magazine, makes the rounds of the talk shows.  But I have to question her qualifications.  Since when did being a Playboy centerfold make you a \\"Girlfriend\\"? What makes a snide high-powered media insider a \\"Girlfriend\\"?  Life in the fast lane living with rock stars makes you a \\"Girlfriend\\"?  Sorry, but out here in the real world, we work full time at home or at a job, don't live in Malibu, don't live in your world, Vicki.

Jonas (Modern Spiritual Masters Series)	Books	5	26	26	N	Y	Fantastic, fascinating... a Nouwen treasure!	This collection of the selected writings of Henri Nouwen is a gem.  Nouwen was one of the greatest theological thinkers and spiritual writers of the last century, and this book makes it clear why.  Jonas begins with a fascinating portrait of Nouwen, the man.  This is one of the most in-depth and fascinating spiritual biographies I have read in a long time!  Jonas' close personal relationship with Nouwen himself and his background as a therapist give real depth to his observations.  The introduction as a stand alone piece is well worth the price of the book!<br />The second part of the book is the meat:  selections from Nouwen's own writing.  They are organized thematically, around such topics as Community, Intimacy, and Being the Beloved (central to Nouwen's theology).  Each selection is perfect... a self-contained revelation.  I used this book as the starting point for a series of sermon's using Nouwen's thought... and it would be wonderful for personal study and devotion as well.  This is the book to start with if you want to understand Henri Nouwen!	2002-04-22

The discussion was wonderful, and students left satisfied with their experience.<br />The only drawback to this workbook:  If you are using it to lead a class, plan on spending time reading the whole book before you begin, and more time on class planning.  For the individual, simply the &quot;LifeKeys&quot; text is more than sufficient... it has all the materials included in this book.

A baby, happily subsisting on one easy to provide substance (breastmilk or formula)now needs more complex nutrition.  What do you start with?  How much should you feed her?  What food is healthiest for him?  Do babies really need to eat that stuff in all the tiny little bottles, or is real food ok?  Look no further, your ultimate baby food reference is here!<br />From very specific instructions on the first feeding, to detailed lists of foods and amounts, over 350 recipes, advice on cleaning and food safety, kitchen craft ideas, and a crash course in nutrition... this book really covers it all!  There are not only exhausitve details about making your own baby food, but schedules and how-tos that make it easy and not overly time consuming.  Several friends recommended it to me, and I see why!  You really don't need any other baby food book.<br />Yaron is informed and authoritative, without being pushy.  She even admits to having a few bottles of the jarred food on hand for emergencies and travel.  Be flexible, do what works for you... that's the message here!<br />I was a bit concerned when I read several of the reviews below:  the author didn't know the danger of nitrates or food allergies?  Well, clearly the reviewers didn't read the book thoroughly or carefully.  Yaron writes on pages 38-39 in detail  about the nitrate problem in spinach and carrots, what causes it, the dangers, and what age most doctors agree it is safe for babies to eat these foods.  Pages 28-34 deal in detail with the problem of food allergies, including egg whites and peanuts.  General recommendations are made, as well as advice if your family has any food allergies, and constant encouragement to discuss your feeding plans with your pediatrician.  For example, she does use egg yolks in her baby food, but only the complex proteins in egg whites are considered a high-risk allergen. Not only that, but she gives lists of high allergy danger foods, and tells parents how to recognize potentially dangerous allergic reactions.  Again, perhaps some people just didn't read the book cover to cover.  In my opinion, if anything she is a little too obsessive about food safety, but then again I eat raw cookie dough and don't write books about baby food.<br />If your feeding plans are to fill your baby with pre-processed, pre-packaged baby food you don't need this book, and Gerber sends out a little advertisement/checklist to every new Mom in America anyhow.

As a new parent it is easy to feel that it is impossible to be a good mom or dad--this book shows you how.  It's called Attachment Parenting because the author describes how to be emotionally attached to your child, and who can argue with that?<br />Personally, I don't see what all the controversy is about.  While there seem to be people who felt that if they couldn't do EVERYTHING the book said, it must be useless, I assumed I was supposed to take what I could and leave what was impossible.

I never felt judged because we have our son in a crib (I do sleep better), but I also was convinced never to Cry It Out.  Compromise.<br />I must disagree with all the rigamorole some people have posted about how &quot;too much attention will ruin your child&quot;.  As a Methodist minister who has worked extensively with youth, most of the problems we see are with kids who get too little attention from their parents, not too much.  Are there some spoiled kids (especially here in this affluent suburb?).  Certainly!  But they are spoiled with too many Things, not too much Love, and often get even less attention than their peers!

As a woman and a mainline protestant minister myself, there is no doubt that she has named the pain of generations of women who suddenly woke up and realized they were not fully included.<br />Her journey is beautiful, deep, and heartfelt.  Another Christian reviewer wrote, &quot;not my Journey&quot;.  Well, Kidd's experience is not mine either... I have chosen to work within the church rather than leave the value I find there.  Yet her journey is both understandable, and fully her own.  When I was in seminary in the early to mid 90s, this book was definately required reading for all the female pastors-to-be.  I have recommended it to women in my church who are struggling with their desire for a more feminine spirituality, who question the status quo and their own assumptions about the nature of the divine.<br />I love this book not so much as a guidebook to a post-<br />Christian place, or even a feminist manifesto, but as a how-to for spiritual searching.  Highly recommended for both male and female seekers!	2002-04-02

It sounds too simple perhaps, but this book is very persuasive--it all makes good sense!<br />The bibliographies and curriculum presented are invaluable!

Lots of good picks here, though some of my old favorites were missing, alas.<br />Trelease also mentions that comic books are a great way to get kids to start reading, but then doesn't give enough information about appropriate reads for kids.  Since most of the comic market today is adult oriented, it would be helpful for most folks to have more guidance in this area.  There are wonderful comic book titles appropriate for kids out there like \\"Akiko\\", \\"Leave it to Chance\\",  \\"Bone\\" -- even kid versions of old favorites like \\"Batman Adventures\\" and \\"Justice League Adventures\\".

I devoured it in record time (especially considering my husband and I were battling it out for our one copy), and then started plotting which of our friends to lend it to first.<br />Full of literary allusions, witty asides, and jokes that will have you digging out your old English Lit. texts, &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; is a fantastic first novel!  What if we lived in a world where literature was more important than sports--and gangs of artists roamed the streets?  What if everyone had the equivalent of a masters in the classics, and pop culture was made up of, well, culture?  Combine these absurdities with secret service agents, time travel, and a bit of romance, and you have a great engaging mix.<br />I can't recommend the book highly enough... and it may even inspire you to dig out your dusty old copy of Jane Eyre!	2002-04-02

Our son is only four months old, but we have enjoyed the early activies and will most likely continue using it for the entire five years.<br />Every week is given one developmental activity, including information about the learning goals and reason behind each one.  The games are simple, and can be used to encourage you child to develop appropiately.  There are lots of new ideas, plus old favorites like \\"Where is Thumbkin\\" that I had forgotten!<br />The book does have a simple, self-published feel about it, but I actually found that charming.  It's kind of like having a built-in grandma who knows lots about little ones right at your fingertips.<br />One drawback that kept this from being a five star product for us:  the \\"home-made\\" nature of many of the toys is a little over the top for me.  I bought soft balls, rather than make ones out of old socks.  And spools... this book must use spools in a dozen different ways!  Who has spools anymore?  I don't even know how to sew! Again, I substituted appropriately.  But if you are the \\"crafty\\" type, you'll eat this up!	2002-04-01

This book is similar to her others in that it is a strange mix of fascinating ideas and uneven storytelling.  I enjoy the characters and concepts, am intrigued by the overarching plot about the ultimate goals of the company, but Baker definately has problems with pacing and plot structure.<br />Some events which could be given much more attention are blown off with a few words, others (like the huge chapter describing a festival play -- not quite as bad as the interminable scene-by-scene descriptions of movies in &quot;Mendoza in Hollywood&quot;) go into painfully dull detail for long periods of time.  Main problem with this installment:  Nothing really HAPPENS!<br />However, it's a quick read, has some great funny scenes (the whole Roadrunner/Coyote scene made the novel worth it!), and a really interesting premise... that's what keeps me coming back.	2002-02-28

In our hectic, modern world, it is too easy to forget our connection to the eternal and  infinite.  This first volume of &quot;The Divine Hours&quot; is a wonderful  tool to help restore our connection to God.  As a non-Roman Catholic (I am  a Methodist minister), I am nevertheless both comforted and connected by  the beautiful use of scripture and traditional prayer.  The introductory  material on the history and use of the hours is wonderful... I have even  found myself inspired to chant many of the psalms!  One drawback--the  summer volume (Ordinary Time, in liturgical language) was printed first,  and is not officially appropriate until June!  I was intrigued enough to  throw the calendar to the winds just this once, and started in immediately  (I guess I will repeat this volume in the Summer), but I am eagerly  anticipating the next two installments.  &quot;The Divine Hours&quot; is  wonderful addition to any spiritual library, and an incredible way to  deepen and intensify your own spiritual life.	2000-03-25

As a child I collected the hardcover versions of the Oz books, and Paradox in Oz will find a valued place among them.  Adding complexity and depth to the story  is part of the fun... and part of the experience for those of us who have  never outgrown our Oz-y roots.  Like all the original Oz books, I think  kids would enjoy it... but adults will appreciate it more.  The prose is  enticing, the pictures are fantastic!  If you pick up one as a gift for a  favorite child, don't forget one for yourself!	2000-01-01
US	50844737	RPRCCFO2EENUL	1569471509	649148645	Making History	Books	5	4	6	N	N	A Great Read -- and some thought provoking stuff too!	I enjoyed this novel immensely -- and found it well platformed and structured.  It asks some questions about the nature of evil, the effects of oppression, and ties it all up in an amusing &quot;alternate  history&quot; story.  The underlying issues of sexuality and self-discovery  made the book more interesting to me, and gave the characters added depth.  I immediately gave it to my husband to read... and I'll recommend it to  others!	1999-12-09
