You could have the most incredible life altering product and it won't mean anything if you don't market it properly. That's why I was so earger to read this book. It had gotten great reviews and it was talked about often but when I read it I was so disspointed. There was nothing novel or exciting about the advice given in this book; it was at times too general and too detailed to be of much use. After I had read Mastering Guerrilla Marketing, I read Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine. This book was also highly recommended and I was slightly apprehensive. But I was pleased. The writing was sharp and intelligent, the advice was up-to-date and relevant, and the theories were right on target. Mastering Gerrilla Marketing tries but it comes up woefully short.	2002-09-05

It was brilliant and current and the methods were spot on.  Theories such as the Magoo Theory helped me to really zone in on why certain techniques work and why others don't.
