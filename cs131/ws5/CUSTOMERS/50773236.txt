Breen offers little in the way of biography other than material provided by DPRK itself. Granted, Kim Jong-il is enigmatic, however Breen's work would have been substantially furhtered had he persued his psycho-political research.  The author's brief passages subjecting Kim Jong-il to J.D. Barber's  The Presidential Character methodology was clever and thought provoking.  Had he been able to move his argument further in that direction, perhaps drawing new scholarship into the picture, a clearer picture of Kim Jong-il would appear.  Still, Breen's descriptions of his own travels through North Korea were enlightening. As it is indeed, \\"the hermit kingdom\\" any description of the North proves intersting.  In conclusion, for a good compliaiton of Kim Jong-il info, Breen serves well, but if one is looking for a more indepth biography, it would likely be best to look elsewhere.	2005-10-08

First, I admittedly am not a Quantrill scholar, but I am a hobbiest, and as such I am disgruntled at the amount of errors found in this work.  After reading a number of other Quantrill bios, as well as other literature on the war in the border region, the discrepencies between other works in the field, and Schultz's book tremendous.<br /><br />Some of Schultz's assumptions regarding border on perjury.  For example, Schultz argues that Quantrill was nothing more than a self-interested brigand who had little or no ideology regarding the war. Rather, accroding to Schultz, Quantrill's main motivation was the thrirst for pluder and blood.<br /><br />All errors aside, the book does have some merit.  For example, Schultz is superb at creating a historical narative that keeps the reader turning pages.  His description of the raid on Lawrence was excellent.  I just wish that Schultz would have supported his great writing ability with a closer eye strained towards historical accuracies.	2005-04-21

However, with his exceptionally detailed and researched work, Martin Windrow is closing on Fall's seat at the pinacle.<br /><br />Not only does Windrow provide new and enlightening information regarding the battle itself, but he provides a through and helpfull description of both Vietnam and France prior to the First Indochina War, thus providing the reader with the necessary materials to better grasp greater understanding of the conflict than did Fall's Hell in a Very Small Place.<br /><br />Furthermore, Windrow provided even more maps and diagrams than the late Dr. Fall and as such allows the reader to nearly reenact the decisive battle, not only through the excellent written descriptions, but by actually seeing troop movements, the location of stragtegic points, enemy emplacements, ad infiitium.<br /><br />In short, Windrow's The Last Valley is a wonderful and much needed addition to the Dien Bien Phy cannon and will surely become a classic in the study of the First Indochina war.	2005-04-21

However, few people have taken the time to study and wade through the many and often conflicting histories of Gaius Caesar, more readily known as Caligula.<br /><br />Throughout history, Emperor Gaius Caesar, has been portrayed as the epitome of a ruthless despot, who disgustingly and savagely exploited his position of power. However, Dr. Barrett successfully attempts to pare down the historical exaggerations regarding Gaius' reign, and debunk many of the myths that were the result of grudges and prejudices espoused by antiquity's historians, most notably the famed Dio and Suetonius.<br /><br />Barrett maintains that Caligula did indeed exploit his power, going so far as to force the wives of Roman nobles to enter his bedroom, flay and execute those seen as potential usurpers with little or no evidence, and occasionally fulfilling whims that can only be seen to border on madness.<br /><br />Still, Barrett contends that these traits were not solely confined to the reign of Caligula.  Rather, Barrett provides evidence that the unseemly behavior of Gaius Caesar was not uncommon to nearly all of the Julio-Claudian emperors.<br /><br />\\"All of the Julio-Claudians exhibit to some degree the same combination of a  passion for vulgar pursuits and a lively interest in matters of the intellect.\\"-Barrett<br /><br />Aside from Barrett's comparison between emperors, he provides enlightening insight into the works of Dio and Suetonius, perhaps the foremost historians of Caligula's reign.  In his work, Barrett examines the possible flaws in the works of both Dio and Suetonius, exploring and reinterpreting much of the material in order to better understand the actual mentality of Caligula.<br /><br />For example, Barrett argues that many of the tales of Gaius' debauchery could actually be rooted in the Emperor's sharp, albeit crude humor.  He argues that many of Caligula's notable acts of depravity may not have occurred, but were the result of misinformation and rumor, based upon Caligula's scathing and unpredictable wit.  It is contended that Caligula's words caused more upset than his actions.<br /><br />Although Barrett's account of Caligula does not release the emperor of any of his infamy, it places his behavior into the realm of the less spectacular.  Barrett argues that rather than epitomize an evil despot, Gaius Caesar was simply one of many emperors of the time who were corrupted by power and found themselves filling their animalistic and hedonistic desires, often at the expense of their subjects.many of Caligula's notable acts of depravity may not have occurred, but were the result of misinformation and rumor, based upon Caligula's scathing and unpredictable wit.

However, there is a new darkness that has overtaken modern Africa, a darkness that plagues the content. This darkness is composed of governmental corruption, violent coups, genocide, ethnic cleansing, guerilla warfare and other forms of exploitation and violence.<br /><br />One of the most blatant examples of this impinging darkness was the rule Zaire's President Mobutu.  His insatiable thirst for cruelty brought Zaire, a nation with massive potential for wealth and prosperity, to its knees and subsequently destroyed the will of his own proud people.<br /><br />Michaela Wrong follows the rise of Mobutu, the once obscure military aide, and chronicles his nearly instinctual political maneuvers which finally consolidated his grip on the throat of Zaire.  Wrong also illustrates the effects of Mobutu's \\"kleptocracy\\" which essentially bled the nation and its people dry of any wealth, and economic potential.<br /><br />Apart from bankrupting a nation, perhaps the saddest result of Mobutu's reign was destruction of a nation's will.  The people of Zaire not only grew disillusioned with Mobutu's leadership, but became disillusioned with the hope of betterment.  In the minds of many of those living in Zaire under Mobutu, the thought of struggling everyday to eek out a living seemed pointless.  At the end of that day, the Mobutu government would come and reap all that was so painfully sown.<br /><br />The title of book is In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz, named after the power hungry character in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Wrong does draw vague parallels between the two. Still, the parallels do lend an interesting twist to the work.  Both Mobutu and Kurtz were corrupted by power and the vast wealth hidden in the darkest Africa, and once they tasted those sweet riches, their appetites became insatiable and cost Africa dearly.rly.  <br />	2005-01-07

Indeed, history has proved his sentiments correct, and there are few greater examples of a more voracious political animal than that of Dr. Henry Kissinger.<br /><br />Regardless of one's opinions of Dr. Kissinger, his contribution to the field of political science: diplomacy, foreign policy and international relations, is unquestionable. During his long and often tumultuous career, Dr. K has met with the most notable global powers and has been at the fore of many of the most pressing political issues of the last forty years.  Perhaps the most important and certainly most noted were his negotiations to end the Vietnam War.<br /><br />In this one volume, taken from his memoirs and supplemented with new information, Kissinger examines not only the Nixon administrations attempts at finding a resolution to the conflict, but also discusses the long history of American entanglement in the conflict.<br /><br />Once the historical basis is firmly in place, Kissinger delves into the negotiations between himself and high-level North Vietnamese cadre, namly Le Duc Tho.<br /><br />Dr. K's discussion and analysis of the negotiations not only well illustrates the steps of American foreign policy (interesting in their own right) but allows the reader to see deeper into the Vietnam Conflict and why it took so long to conclude.<br /><br />Kissinger also discusses his controversial role in the bombing of Cambodia and Laos.  Much has been written to condemn Dr. K, and although his analysis of the bombing is enlightening, the work does little in the way of vindication.<br /><br />All in all, Kissinger provides a very good source documenting his participation in the Vietnam War and the subsequent de-escalation, as well as illustrating the process of high-level negotiations in global diplomacy.	2004-11-16

Of the artists, there are painters: others sculptors, musicians, poets or writers.  For some, like Neal Cassady, their medium was Being.<br /><br />Although a muse for the likes of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Ferlingetti, and in many ways the adrenaline to the Beat Generation, Cassady was not a writer.  Writing wasn't Neal's gig.  Perhaps the pen was too slow for him; the medium just couldn't convey his essence. Rather Neal was a live show. It seems cruel to find him trapped on paper - like watching a tiger at the zoo, the wild drained off through those all confining bars.<br /><br />The first few chapters of The First Third are slow and seem forced.  However, the vibe changes drastically once Neal's family tree is throughly discussed.  It's as if Cassady has quit the pretentious wordplay and dictated thoughts to paper, which give the remainder of the book a much more genuine feel.<br /><br />The most enlightening segment of the book is the select correspondence between Neal, Jack Kerouac, Ken Kesey and others. It provides an insight into Neal that is raw, unedited and seems a much more accurate description than Cassady's own attempt at biography.	2004-11-09

Names like Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox still make many Americans cringe with thoughts of bullets, sabres, and grape shot tearing through ranks of steadily marching countrymen.<br /><br />However, there was another smaller, beastly war occuring along the contested boarder region between Missouri and Kansas. Rarely was there a conflict between the massive armies of the C.S.A. and U.S.A. Rather it was a war of attrition waged by roving bands of maruaders who were less interested in ideology and more concerned with loot and plunder.  Indeed, along the border raged a savage guerrilla war.<br /><br />With the State of Kansas predomintly in support of the Federal Union, and the Missourians leaning towards Jeff Davis' Confederate States, the border was a tinderbox, and sparks were everywhere.  Incidents of violence were common, and reprisal raids were bloody.<br /><br />Leslie provides an excellent and informative book regarding not only the Missouri-Kansas border war, but one of the principal guerrila chieftains, William Clarke Quantrill. Q's band of raiders, which included such infamous names as Jesse and Frank James, Cole Younger, and the notorious \\"Bloody\\" Bill Anderson waged a war with few if any rules.  Prisoners were executed with out remorse, cities and towns were burned to the ground, and civilians attempting the least resistance were gunned down, usually with one pistol ball to the head. Rather than being a rarity, Q's band was one of many roaming the countyside.  The Unionists also maintained their guerrila fighters under the name of Jayhawkers who were equally ruthless as Quantrill; the difference being they were partial to the execution of Southern sympathizers.<br /><br />Leslie follows the story of Q and the Kansas-Missouri war from its inception to its conclusion.  He keeps his observations objective and provides a clear picture of both the C.S.A. and the U.S.A.

Welsh is experimental, not only through his inventive use of the Scottish dialect, but also through the syntax of his work.<br /><br />Acid House is a conglomeration of short stories, an unfortuntely small collection of poems, as well as a creativly written novela. Many of the story plots may seem redundant; however, with a closer read one can find deeper words than a simply tale of excess and depression. My personal favorite story deals with a down and out pub rat and his strangely enlightening discussion with a disillusioned God.<br /><br />Indeed, Welsh has been quite prolific in the last ten years, having a number of books converted to screen, including Acid House. It is nice to see an author taking a gamble and creating something new.	2004-11-05

What unfolded was a remarkable story of one man's insanity and another's passion for capturing the entire history of the English language on the printed page.<br /><br />Dr. W.C. Minor, the \\"American lunatic\\" was a highly educated Civil War veteran suffering from schizophrenia.  While living in England in an attempt to escape his ever-present feelings of persecution, he shot a man dead. Being obviously deluded, the British government sentenced him to an unspecified term in Broadmore lunatic asylum.<br /><br />His counter-point, Professor James Murray, then editor of the OED, sent out a request for all men and women of letters to contribute definitions and quotations to the compilation of the dictionary. What unfolded was a relationship spanning over twenty years between The Professor and the Madman.<br /><br />Winchester creates three distinct and affecting personalities, all of which compliment each outher beautifuly: Dr. Minor, Prof. Murray, and quite interestingly, the OED takes on an almost human quality. It is Winchester's skill at blending these three unique personalities and they become interlaced that keeps the reader turning the page. Indeed, a wonderful and absorbing book.	2004-10-20

It would seem that most Thompson readers fail to see that Thompson's works, far from being one esoteric drug opus, range the spectrum of popular cultre, politics, and to a great extent a large segment of American history.<br /><br />One of his best and most illuminating books, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72, is written with the cutting commentary and breakneck pace so recognizable as Thompson. However, each comment and postulation is well researched and based on deep thought, even if enhanced by the occassional milky hit of Singapore Gray.<br /><br />Thompson studies the 1972 Presidential election month by month, following both polls and candidates across the nation.  Rather than see the election as a political institution, Thompson slices away the media fat and studies candidates, their motivations, and the varied behavior of the American constituency.<br /><br />The author takes time to explore each candidate, although concentrating mostly on the Democratic Party, discussing their platforms on the major issues of the time: amnesty, the de-escalation of Vietnam, the civil rights movement, etc. and accurately and insightfully illustrates their place in not only the election, but in America during the early 1970's.<br /><br />Thompson, having closely studied politics for innumberable years illustrates waves and trends throughout American politics, from 1964-72, with numerous and ultimately accurate predictions for the future.<br /><br />Although a different work than Fear in Loathing in Las Vegas, a very interesting and personal look at American politics and Thompson the journalist.

Mangold and Penycate refrain from the usual Western bias that often plagues the Vietnam paperback genere and instead have created a very well researched and objective study of Cu Chi province and its unique history.<br /><br />Most of the research is composed of countless interviews with American military personel, coupled with very enlightening interviews with NLF leaders and guerrillas. Aside from simply providing military analysis, the authors dig into the history, culture and society of Vietnam, which lends to an interesting \\"sociological and historical context\\" to the creation of the Cu Chi Tunnels and the incrediable endurance of the Vietnamese people.<br /><br />Most interesting were the views of the Vietnamese fighting and surviving in the tunnels - enduring the full wrath of American military might being unleashed a few shallow meters above their heads. Vietnam was a brutal event from a Western perspective, but actually hearing tales from the NLF side makes the conflict seem all the more horrible.  Mangold and Penycate give a face to the elusive Viet Cong, and the reader discovers names, histories and lives to accompany those Vietnamese faces.<br /><br />Aside from strictly discussing the tunnels, the authors cover the whole of Cu Chi Province and its seemingly everpresent role in the numerous Indochina wars.  Being close to Saigon, Cu Chi was a major hub for NLF activity and for the first years of the Second Indochina war, served as a nearly impenatarble Viet Cong stronghold.  However, as American tactics evolved and mobility became a key aspect of American strategy, Cu Chi became a prime target for American search and destroy missions and massive B-52 strikes - essentially making Cu Chi one of the most heavily bombed areas in the Vietnamese theatre.<br /><br />Still, once the bombs ceased to fall, and the end of the war came to bear, the people returned to Cu Chi and once again rebuilt their lives, just as they had with the Japanese, then the French, and ultimately the Americans.and the end of the war came to bear, the people returned to Cu Chi and once again rebuilt their lives, just as they had with the Japanese, then the French, and ultimately the Americans.	2004-10-13

With Europe attempting to stem the blitzkrieg, and France soon to fall to Nazi Germany, the French colonies in Indochina were quickly consumed by the Japanese war machine.<br /><br />Following the Japanese defeat in WW II, a power-vacuum emerged in South East Asia.  In order to fill the vacuum, the nationalist Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh, attempted to create a sovereign nation.  France, attempting to regain control of its lost colonies quickly sent troops to re-establish control. Thus began the First Indochina war.<br /><br />Rather than concentrating on the entire conflict, Dr. Fall discusses in depth, perhaps the most defining moment of the war, the siege and fall of Dien Bien Phu.<br /><br />Based upon countless interviews with active participants and careful analysis of innumerable government documents, Dr. Fall pieces together an amazing history of the battle in nearly minute by minute description.  Not only does he discuss the actual battle but also the subsequent political implications that made Dien Bien Phu one of the most decisive events of mid-20th century, comparable to the Cuban Missle Crisis or the end of the Korean War.<br /><br />Dr. Fall's account is highly readable, dividing the work between strategical analysis and an extensive description of the myriad and strikingly unique men participating in the battle, from the Commander-In-Chief of French forces, to the individual strong point commanders.<br /><br />Indeed, Fall has produced a seminal work of a watershed event that will remain for sometime the peerless account of Dien Bien Phu and the resulting end to French colonialism in Indochina.lism in Indochina.	2004-10-08

Slightly Out of Focus is a brilliant illustration of Capa's multifacited skills as a journalist.<br /><br />Beginning in 1942, Capa, a Hungarian exile, describes his life as a \\"potential enemy alien\\" living in New York City and the subsequent difficulties of trying to attain passage to the European theatre. These biographical snippets lend an interesting take on Capa the man; aspects all too often over-powered by his fame as a photographer.<br /><br />Once arrived in Europe, Capa creates an interesting tale of love and adventure. Originally, Slightly Out of Focus was to serve as screen play. As such, Focus is based on actual events, but tinted with imagination in order to be better suited for Hollywood. Nevertheless, the work is historically accurate and Capa's insights of World War II cut to the quick.<br /><br />Interestingly, Capa views the World War II experience as enlightening and generally good.  Rarely are there the melancholy sentiments that color other war memoirs, (i.e. famed combat photographer Tim Page). The exception being a brief allusion to bearing witness to the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. An instance where Capa chose not to click the shutter.<br /><br />I would be curious to discover more of Capa's writings regarding his time spent covering other conflicts, namely the Arab-Israeli War and the first Indochina war.<br /><br />As a successful newspaperman, Capa wrote a number of articles to accompany his pictures.<br /><br />Although his photos have always retained their cutting edge brilliance, I often wonder if his observations and opinions changed with age, and the nature of these other conflicts.

The campaign was constitutionaly illegal and serves as a glaring result of unchecked Executive power.<br /><br />Shawcross discusses the B-52 raids over Cambodia in great detail. His use of countless government documents, gathered through the Freedom of Information Act, brush away much of the smoke that had, prior to publication, clouded the incident in secrecy.<br /><br />Shawcross sites many reasons why the architect of the campaign, Dr. Henry Kissinger, viewed the bombing of Cambodia as a dire necessity to U.S. national security.  Kissinger held that North Vietnamese supply lines and sanctuaries located along the Vietnam-Cambodian border were costing numerous American lives and were preventing the Vietnamization of the war, hence prolonging U.S. involvment. Until these sancutuaries were destroyed, Nixon would not be able to achieve, his  \\"Peace with Honor.\\" Further more, Kissinger understood that the Vietnamese were in a strong position in negotiating peace.  It was hoped that the massive bombing campaign would force the Vietnamese to consent to a mutual cease-fire.  Kissinger's rationle does make a great deal of sense when studying the situation from a realist perspective, as does Dr. K's \\"Madman Theory,\\" of war and foreign policy.<br /><br />Kissinger believed that essentially a nation's foreign policy would prove ineffective if not backed by a threat of irrational force.  When it became time to negotiate peace with Hanoi, the Nixon administration's insanity, represented by the devestation of a neutral nation, was supposed to bring strength to the American position.<br /><br />Ironically, the bombing of Cambodia was one of the main factors in the demise of the Nixon administration, lead to an notable increase in Communist support, and ultimately was the catalyst for the third Indochinese war.<br /><br />Indeed, Shawcross provides an interesting study on the effects the American campaign had, not only on the destablization of Cambodia, but also on the rise of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. With U.S. urging, if not complicity, Lon Nol usurped acting head of state King Nordom Sihanouk, thus creating a strong bond with the United States.  Being fueled with U.S. weapons, dollars and advisors, Lon Nol began to wage a war against communist insurgents as well as any party viewed as hostile to his regime.<br /><br />As the conflicts raged in Lon Nol's Cambodia, evidence of the Nixon/Kissinger bombing campaign came to light.  Congress was appalled and demanded the immediate halt to the air strikes. Kissinger was left without a valuable bargaining chip at the peace talks in Paris.  The Vietnamese leadership knew that administration was on the political ropes, and that South Vietnam was on the verge of toppling completely.<br /><br />As North Vietnamese forces closed on the southern capital Saigon, Khmer Rouge forces took Phnom Penh, signaling another communist victory in South East Asia.  Now, instead of dousing the flames of communism in the region, the U.S. unintentionally created three communist states: Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia.<br /><br />With the emergence of Watergate evidence, the Nixon administration was a sinking ship, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Aside from simply documenting the Cambodian bombings, Shawcross often attacks Kissinger the man.  He often uses testimony, interviews and assorted documents in order to paint Dr. K as a demented war-monger, and liar; yet always staying between the lines of legality.<br /><br />Kissinger was deeply resentful of the publication of such a scathing attack, going so far as to publish his own rebuttal, albeit written under the name of an underling.  The banter between the Kissinger camp and Shawcross continued for a number of years, and I imagine Kissinger cringing everytime he sees a copy of Sideshow.<br /><br />As scathing as Shawcross' attack on Kissinger may be, Dr. K was still a very adept diplomat, and during his time serving the Nixon administration did accomplish some stunning diplomatic coups, such as normalizing relations with China. In conclusion, like everything, there are two sides, and one seeking to truly understand history will analyze both sides with equal scrutiny.e he sees a copy of Sideshow. <br /> <br />As scathing as Shawcross' attack on Kissinger may be, Dr. K was still a very adept diplomat, and during his time serving the Nixon administration did accomplish some stunning diplomatic coups, such as normalizing relations with China.

The threat of war and annexation have always glimmered on the horizon;since the time of Angkor.  It is a land where power is amassed by the edge of the sword, and control is maintained by armies, not democratic rule.  The ideals of Western democracy are foreign to Cambodia and as such, may only emerge following years of enforced stablity and political socialization.<br /><br />At present, Cambodia is undergoing a transition.  There is a budding attempt to evolve from a post-conflict, authoritarian nation, into a modern, developed democracy.  Still, if this metamorphosis is to be successful, it must be guided by a strong hand.  In the case of Cambodia, this assertive leadership is embodied by Hun Sen.<br /><br />Since his earliest political involvement, Hun Sen possessed a sincere interest in the well-being of Cambodia. His main catalyst for joining the maquis was the overthrow of King Nordom Sihanouk and the subsequent emergence of the Lon Nol regime. Like many Cambodian's who found themselves entrenched with the early Khmer Rouge, Hun Sen was not a radical communist fighting for a socialist ideology, but rather had become disillusioned with the Lon Nol regime and sought the restoration of monarchy.<br /><br />It seems that Hun Sen was able to recognize the merits and flaws of communism from early on. He realized that in order for socialism to be successful, it is necessary for a leader to possess a malleable policy, not one impervious to changing variables.<br /><br />Originally seated in Cambodia's political leadership following the toppling of the Khmer Rouge regime, he remained ardently socialist in order to maintain the flow of foreign aid and other necessities from Cambodia's socialist allies.  However, as time passed and the political situation in Cambodia changed, so did Hun Sen's leadership strategies.<br /><br />Hun Sen has been willing to put aside many grievances in order to benefit the development of Cambodia-for example, following years of strife and disagreement with King Nordom Sihanouk, has been willing to concede some power in order to maintain the peace and stablity of Cambodia.<br /><br />It is apperent the Hun Sen possesses a vision of a peaceful and prosperous future for Cambodia, and perhaps it is his belief that he and he alone is able to make this future a reality.<br /><br />It will be most interesting to see just what continuing role Hun Sen plays as Cambodia continues to grow economically and democratically.rom Cambodia's socialist allies.

This fascination arose with the first traders, be they Indic, Roman or Chinese, who discovered the river emptying into the South China Sea.<br /><br />The river is old and exotic and just as it flows from cold Tibet, through China, and the flood-plains of South East Asia, the river flows through history.<br /><br />Osborne does and excellect job capturing the feeling of the Mekong River and its subsequent effect on history.  Osborne attacks his work chronologically, beginning in the proto-history of mainland South East Asia during the emergence of a major trading center known as Oc Eo located at the Mekong Delta. Evidence of the importance of Oc Eo as an economic sea port is apparent by the archeological finding of artifacts originating from Rome, China, as well as the Indian sub-continent.<br /><br />Throughout the next six centuries this area, which the Chinese named Funan, continued to grow and develop.  However, due to conflict and changes in economic patterns Funan fell to the wayside and a new era arose, that of Chenla.<br /><br />Chela was split between two kingdoms, one based in present day Cambodia, and the other possibly in Laos.  Nevertheless, both kingdoms were located on the muddy banks of the Mekong.  From these two kingdomsemerged one of the greatest empires to have graced South East Asia, that of Angkor.<br /><br />One of the major reasons that Angkor was able to develop to such greatness was do to an anomaly of nature.  During the rainy season, the flood waters, coupled with the snow melt originating in the high Himalayas, caused the Mekong to force surplus water up it's sister river the Tonle Sap.  Due to this massive induction of water, the Tonle Sap acctually reverses course, trapping millions of fish in the Great Lake, on the banks of which Angkor was located.<br /><br />These fish, which even today, teem the lake, provide the majority of protein to teh Cambodian people.  With a surplus of food created by the enormous fish supply, and multi-harvent rice agriculture, the Angkor civilization was able to pursue other endeavors, namely trade with the kingdoms located in Thailand and Vietnam. However, like all great empires, Angkor eventually fell.  Being constantly encroached upon by both Thai and Vietnamese armies, the Angkorian court migrated south along the Tonle Sap river until arriving at the location of modern Phnom Penh, the meeting point of the two major rivers, the Mekong and the Tonle Sap.<br /><br />The next 500 years saw the major exploration and colonization of South East Asia by Western powers.  During the 16th century most exploration was conducted by the Portugese and Spanish missionaries.  Eventually, more European players became aware of the wealth of region.  Dutch traders began to explore the Mekong in hopes of finding a trade route with China.  Although great effort was exudued, no trade route was found.  The river became impassable do rapids found in the mountainous regions of Southern Laos.<br /><br />In 1858, France conducted and invasion of Vietnam, and ultimately captured Saigon nine years later.  With a firm foothold in South East Asia, a driving time of exploration began.<br /><br />Osborne discusses a number of French expeditions in detail, most notably the Frech Mekong Expedition, 1866-68.  While providing a solid historical description of events, Osborne still offers great detail of the river itself, as well as the indigenous peoples who populated it's banks. I found it amazing that the descriptions furnished by Osborne describing the Mekong of 150 years ago, were nearly identical to the scenes I witnessed in 2004.<br /><br />More than just a travelogue, Dr. Osborne depicts 2,000 years of history, but seems to concentrate most on the years from 1946 to present.  He examinesthe Japanese invasion of the region, the causes for the rise of communism in South East Asia, and the resultant Indochinese wars and their postliminiary effects upon the river.<br /><br />One interesting point in Osborne's work was in his discussion of how the Mekong forms a cohesivness between nations.  The Mekong, at one point or another, serves as a national border for five natinos adn crosses the soverign territory of a sixth. All of these nations bordering the river are in dire need of energy and investment, two major ingredients towards development.  The Mekong being a potentially grand source for both.<br /><br />For example, in Yunnan Province in Western China, major hudroelectric dams are being developed with the intention of selling surplus energy to it's neighbors.  However, the ecological repurcussions stemming from these projects, which will effect those nations downstream, are only recently coming to light, and the end results of said projects will not be forth coming for a number of years.<br /><br />With each nation seeking the wealth generated by the damming of the river, the outlook of the Mekong looks bleak.  Aside from the ecological damage caused by the building of the dams, the are will shoulder the burden of a social and cultural cost.  Numerous people, in some cases numbering in the hundreds of thousands, become displaced as these dams are created and the course of the river is altered.  There has not been a feasible solution offered to deal with these problems of displacement. The ensuing effects upon the culture of South East Asia, a culture intrinsically linked to the river, has yet to be explored in great detail.<br /><br />It is my contention that as development continues, the traditional ways of life found along the Mekong will become dilluted.  It seems as the though the cost of development, which is a necessity, will be paid for using the river as currency. Indeed, the river is caught in a grim Catch-22.  I has always given life to the land and the people, but now in order for this life to continue, the river may have to give its life completly.hinese wars and their postliminiary effects upon the river. <br /> <br />One interesting point in Osborne's work was in his discussion of how the Mekong forms a cohesivness between nations.

The idea of America being literally torn in two by the emergence of seperate and opposing government seems so far-fetched as to seem surreal.<br /><br />Although aware that the war indeed occured, I, like most Americans knew very little about this era in American history.  However, inorder to understand one's nation and subsequently the Self, it is imperative to understand the socialization of one's native country.<br /><br />The book served as an excellect primer for further study of the American civil war.  It discussed the war chronologically, each chapter explaing one year of the conflict.  For exaple, chapter one is entitled, \\"1861: A House Divided,\\" and provides discussion on the causal events that led to the rise of secessionist parties and the division of the Union.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter a reknowned scholar of the Civil War contributes an essay which serves as a synopsis and conclusion of the chapter; a very interesting and enjoyable addition. Having gathered the basic facts through the main body of the chapter the reader is prepared for the more rigorous works of the academics.<br /><br />In particular, I enjoyed learning of the more peculiar and eccentric characters of the Civil War.  For example, Stonewall Jackson and his religious furor towards the destruction of Northern oppressors, as well as Gen. Sherman, one of the first military commanders to wage total war on the civilian population with the goal of breaking the Confederate army, a tactic later seen in the bombing of civilian populations during World War II.<br /><br />Aside from the colorful men conducting the Civil War, I was interested to learn the scholar's opinions of just what the ultimate results of the war were on the United States.  Shelby Foote argues that the Civil War acctually led to a more cohesive nation, saying that the United States served as a loosly bound group of independent states, each holding strongly to their independence from Federal control.  Following the war, a stronger central government emerged which served as an encompassing umbrella to all states, even regaining the cofidence of those sepratist states of the Confederacy.<br /><br />I was also suprised at many of the technological advance that emerged during the war, perhaps most notably the creation of iron-clad warships and even rudimentary submarines-technology that seems out of place next to the set piece battles in which tens of thousands of men walk willingly into each other's musket balls and bayonets.<br /><br />The British, for many years the undisputed King's of the Seas took special note of this naval advancements.  With the creation of the Union ship, The Monitor, one British observer wrote, \\"About a week ago, (the British) discovered that their whole wooden navy was useless.\\" And such began a change in the balance of global power.<br /><br />Although a great first book about the Civil War, it ended abruptly with the assassination of Lincoln on April 4, 1865.  I would have liked to see more discussion of the reconstruction following the war; how the shattered  pieces of the Republic were reassembled.<br /><br />It seems that when a reconstruction effort is run well, with a genuine desire to rebuild and reintegrate, such as the Marshall Plan in Europe, and MacArthur's rebuilding of Japan, the result is often a better and stronger entity. For at the time, America was torn assunder, but within a few short years, Manifest Destiny took control, and Americans from both North and South spread West and America grew-not only larger, but more integrated and closely woven. This being a most important histroy lesson for the present day global community.<br /><br />Shelby Foote was correct in arguing that those five years did bring the nation closer together. The Civil War may have been a baptism of fire, but from the ashes a stronger America emerged.ndent states, each holding strongly to their independence from Federal control.

He has been in and out of Cambodia since the 1970's, including a trip shorty after the fall of the DPK in 1980.  In 1995, Khmer Rouge forces even accused Kiernan of being a \\"war criminal,\\" beaming the macbre message from guerrilla radio stations along the Thai border.<br /><br />The Pol Pot Regime, a follow up to Kiernan's How Pol Pot Came to Power, begins with the DPK takeover following the fall of the Lon Nol government.  He then provides a nearly 500 page systematic study of the Pol Pot regime.<br /><br />Kiernan breaks the study down into three parts.  The first segment discusses the very early days of the DPK and their paranoid attempt to cling to their hard-won power by emptying the cities, creating agrarian communes and exterminating the human remenants of the Lon Nol era, 1970-75.<br /><br />Kiernan labels this section, \\"Wiping the Slate Clean.\\" Indeed, that is exactly what the Khmer Rouge intended to do, wipe the 'slate,' Cambodia, clean- in order to usher in a new era, even going so far as to declare 1975 Year Zero.<br /><br />Following \\"Wiping the Slate Clean,\\" Kiernan begins to discuss the evolution and implementation of Khmer Rouge policies.  It seems as though the ultimate goal of these radical Marxists was to create an agrarian utopia regardles of cost, even at the risk of turning the nation into one giant charnel house. Following the forced exodus of all major towns and cities, Cambodians were forced into the countryside to grow rice which the DPK felt would lead to the re-emegence of the great Khmer power of the past.  The result was starvation and disease on a scale never before seen.<br /><br />Although production was quite high, the Khmer people were placed on starvation rations. Nearly all surplus rice was exported in exchange for goods and military hardware to support the emerging bloody conflict with neighboring Vietnam. This leads us to Kiernan's third section illustrating the subsequent demise of the DPK.<br /><br />As the war with Vietnam began to escalate, so did paranoia within the Party Cental.  \\"Enemies\\" were ferreted out and executed, including numerous high ranking cadre and military commanders. In 1977, the purges were spiraling out of control.  It wasn't long until a small contingent of DPK leaders grew fearful and disillusioned with the Central Party.  A number of now famous commanders, most notably the current Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, fled to Vietnam and garnered support for the liberation of Kampuchea.  Kiernan does an excellent and indepth job of studying the stucture of the DPK purges and why they lead to the ultimate collapse of the Pol Pot regime.<br /><br />The Eastern Zone of Cambodia, from where the liberation leadership emerged, was was the most heavily purged, not only due to it's close proximity to Vietnam, but also because the Eastern Zone cadre, from the earliest days of the revolution, tended to be less brutal in their treatment of Cambodians, essentially making them weak in the eyes of the Party leadership.<br /><br />Aside from exterminating native Khmer's, the Pol Pot regime launched pogroms against any ethnic minorities, claiming those who were not pure Khmer were in possession of Vietnames minds.<br />It would seem that the DPK was seeking not only an agrarian utopia, but one that also preserved racial purtiy.<br /><br />In conclusion, Kiernan's work is an invaluable source for one working to understand the intricacies of Cambodia during the 1970's.  The Pol Pot Regime was the main source I used prior to visiting Cambodia and although it only covers a brief segment of Cambodian history, it still was extremely helpful in understanding the people and their terribly sad past.ubsequent demise of the DPK.

The pictures were extremely moving and that Page shot his film so close to the horror's of war was remarkable.  He truly has a gift for the camera and a thirst for adrenaline.<br /><br />Although Page is markedly better with a lense than a pen, Victory Garden does provide valuable insight into South East Asia and the wars that plagued this beautiful region.<br /><br />Page's book begins with his time spent with Sean Flynn and other corresopondents covering the Second Indochina War.  He combines sorrow and the horror of war with an almost guilty desire to return to those intense, adrenaline-packed days.  He seems to truly relish the comaraderie forged in blood and fear, then polished with adventrue and laughs.<br /><br />Although Page had been wounded a number of times, he continued to travel Vietnam, on motorbikes, helicopters and whatever other forms of transport would land him at the center of war.  Still, Page is not immune to the stresses and fears of his chosen profession. In a very human passage, Page recalls his final exhaustion of nerves caused by too many close falling bombs and the crack of bullets passing by his ears.  He talks of best friend Sean Flynn snapping him from his mini-breakdown and leaving Vietnam for a brief respite.  However, it wasn't long until Page found himself drawn back into Nam.  This was to be his last stint covering the Second Indochina War.<br /><br />While leaping from a helicopter, a land mine was detonated a short distance from him, essentially destroying his body with shrapnel. Although losing nearly 200cc of brain matter, Page survived, and after a prolonged convalescence, made a full recovery.<br /><br />The remainder of the book deals with Page's return to Indochina during the 1980's, partly for journalistic reasons, but also to investigate the mysterious disapperance of friend Sean Flynn.<br /><br />While Page was recovering from the landmine explosion, Flynn continued to cover the war.<br /><br />With the conflict escalting in Cambodia, Vietnam and the subsequent bombing campaign of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Flynn headed to Cambodia in order to cover the war from a perviously undocumented angle, that of the enemy, those enduring the massive bombing of Eastern Cambodia. It was to be Flynn's last foray to the front. Sometime in 1970, Flynn and another correspondent disappeared in Cambodia, somewhere near the Vietnamese border.<br /><br />In the 1980's, Page decided to return to Indochina inorder to discover what happened to Flynn, and to errect a monument in honor of journalists, from both sides, who were killed during the three Indochinese conflicts.<br /><br />Throughout his search, Page creates a running commentary of the changes that had occured in the region since his own departure.  He illustrates the differences that exist between his days covering the war and his return in the late eighties and early nineties.<br /><br />Being so well educated on the intrcacies of South Eas Asian culture, as well as the history and politics of the region, Page provides an interesting take on what happend then, and what is happening now.<br /><br />Throughout the work, Page refrains from passing judgment on either side.  Instead, Page reminisces about those good times he had during the war, always striving to maintain a positive vein, although occasionaly laced with sadness.  It is a strange combination, but Page pulls it off well.<br /><br />The book could easily be put to music, something that I did while reading the book during travels through Cambodia.

One Year in the Khmer Rouge's S-21	Books	3	17	18	N	N	Vann Nath Gives a Face to Tuol Sleng Prison	Vann Nath is one of seven  surviors to have left Tuol Sleng prison alive.  Prior to his arrest, Vann Nath was the partial owner of a small art business, specializing in landscapes and other illustrations capturing Khmer life.<br /><br />However, following the fall of Phnom Penh to Khmer Rouge forces, and the subsequent exodus, Vann found himself survinving in the Cambodian countryside, participating in the agrarian \\"offensive\\" engineered by the DPK leadership. Like many others, Vann was arrested with no warning and even less reason and transported to Tuol Sleng prison, also known as S-21.<br /><br />At first, Vann Nath was no different from the thousands of other Khmer citizens summonded to S-21 for painful interrogation and ultimate execution. But, due to the meticulous record keeping of the DPK's security organization, Santebal, it was discovered that prior to the revolution Vann was an artist; a skill that would eventually save his life.<br /><br />Although most intellectuals, dancers, etc. were \\"smashed\\" at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, it is a strange twist of fate that someone with the ability to create was spared.  The comandant of S-21, Duch, brought Vann Nath and other artists out of the mass detention cells and placed them in a small, segregated block were they were forced, under penalty of torture and death to create images of Pol Pot and other high ranking DPK cadre. The smallest flaw would have lead to extermination at the killing fields at Choeng Ek.<br /><br />Vann Nath was held prisoner at S-21 for roughly one year.  During that time he was a silent witness to the mass insantiy that plagued Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime. His first hand experience is captured in a number of paintings on display at Tuol Sleng prison today. His paintings hang next to and illustrate the uses of the assorted torture implements displayed in Building B.

However, Eichmann Interrogated allows the reader to study the words of one of the most notorious actors of Hitler's plans for genocide and mass murder.  While reading the transcripts of Eichmann's interrogations at the hands of Israeli police, I attempted to try and understand what would cause Eichmann, a man who in his earlier years had a fascination for Jewish culture, to turn evil and attempt to destroy a whole race of people.  Although the transcripts don't provide an answer to such a complex question, they did provide a means to study Eichmann.  Through out the interrogation, Eichmann consistently denied his role in carrying out the Final Solution.  Rather than admit to any actual killings of Jews, Eichmann stuck to a story which maintained that he was simply a soldier following orders, and even then, his only task was to ensure that the trains containing the Jews were running accurately.  I found it also interesting to read that Eichmann claims to have provided alternatives to the wholesale slaughter of the Jews, such as exportation of all Jews to the African island of Mauritius, or the strangely Zionistic support for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine.  Although the truth about Eichmann and his motivations will never be clear, the transcripts of his interrogation, although possibly filled with lies, provides an interesting historical document for those wishing to learn more about the psychology of the engineers of the Final Solution.	2003-08-03

The conflict for the Korean peninsula is most likely forgotten because it is the most misunderstood of all U.S. conflicts.  It arose from the still smoldering ashes of World War II, at a time when many Americans were just nicely adjusting to a life free of strife and death.  The people were not ready to make another commitment to bloodshed and most, simply looked away.<br />Max Hastings provides an excellent work discussing the complex history of the Korean War.  He not only gives excellent detail and historical insight into battles and other facets of military history, but he also discusses the global ramifications of the war.  For example, Hastings discusses the global political instability following World War II, and how this lead to the U.S. policy of containment.<br />Through out the book, Hastings provided equal parts political history and military history.  Thus providing the reader with an in-depth understanding of the conflict as a whole.

He has unflinchingly assailed big business and corrupt politicians in his many books and essays and defended the rights of Americans innumerable times.<br />Dreaming War is the latest collection of Vidal essays, most taken from The Nation, in which Vidal illustrates the many hypocrisies and travesties that plague the American government.  He then uses these examples to explain just why America is in the deplorable state it is presently in.  He explains that America is not the great protector of inalienable rights that it attempts to portray itself to be.  Rather, Vidal argues, the American hierarchy is filled with scheming, money-hungry con men, whose first priority is to line their own pockets and strengthen their personal power.<br />In this day and age, of the Patriot Act and weakening civil rights, a voice like Gore Vidal is invaluable.  It is imperative that the people remain aware of the actions of government, and speak out against injustice.  Hopefully, Gore Vidal will continue his crusade, and if so we all will benefit.	2003-07-16

Many of Bukowski's contemporaries were outspoken opponents to the war in Vietnam, and champions of numerous other social injustices.  Bukowski, on the other hand remained distant from these dramatic social ills, and instead concentrated upon the smaller, although much more common societal ailments such as poverty, class struggle and alcoholism.<br />I think Bukowski's lack of grandiose preaching for any given cause actually gives his work the serrated edge that makes it so endearing to Bukowski fans.  His stories cut to the quick.  There is no room for sympathy or pity.  Bukowski begs no quarter, and none is given.  But in the same breath, the reader is enthralled with the voyeuristic window into Bukowkski's life.  The inner pain, madness, and broken-tooth philosopher remain near the surface, easily seen, but never easily forgotten.<br />I tend to prefer Bukowski's poetry to his short stories and novels.  The poems tend to cut to the quick, and the short stories tend to drag on a bit, losing the classic Bukowski punch.  Still, in this compilation there are some gems, most notably \\"A .45 To Pay The Rent,\\" \\"An Evil Town,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Animal Crackers In My Soup.\\"	2003-07-16

It seems that Buford uses the British soccer scene as his own private laboratory in which to study violence and crowd behavior.  He attempts to discover the meaning and reasoning behind the escapades of these young men by studying them as individuals, then as societal groups, and finally, as a mass of humanity that evolves into an unrelenting mob certain to cause unprovoked violence.<br />Buford attempted to infiltrate these groups in order to gather a better understanding of these young men as individuals.  He learned that most are uneducated and unemployed, and if employed, usually in menial, low-paying jobs.  They are the dregs of society, without much hope of improving their station.  This theme was continuous throughout the work, be it in reference to \\"soccer hooligans,\\" or skinhead fascists.<br />By coming together in a loosely organized fashion, with a common rallying point, these men find their niche.  They are no longer pariahs, but rather one powerful body.  Then, this powerful body feels the need to exercise its new found strengths.  It exercises its vengeance upon the same humanity that banished them from a respectable place.<br />Buford offered no answers the problems of societal violence, but did provide some reasons.  Throughout the work he makes reference to class struggle and the discrepancies between rich and poor.  No work, and no opportunity leads to a stressful situation.  A boiling point appears and the pressure must be relieved.  For many of the younger generation, the pressure is relived in random street violence under the guise of European football rivalries.	2003-07-02

Not only is Pisor documenting one of the longest battles of the Vietnam War, but also delving into the repercussions of Khe Sanh.  Do to his journalistic objectivity, Pisor is able to separate the governmental propaganda, and the rhetoric of the political Left, and form an accurate description of an event that shaped America.<br />Although the Tet Offensive is credited with breaking American resolve for the war, Pisor adds that the siege at Khe Sanh is tantamount to the de-escalation of the war. After impressive words from General Westmorland and Lyndon Johnson regarding the importance of a hold at Khe Sanh, numerous American's became disillusioned when the whole base was bulldozed into the earth.  For what reason were all those American lives spent?  Why should men die for land that will simply be reverted to barren waste?  As Pisor points out, Khe Sanh serves as a watershed for the end of the Vietnam War much like Dien Bien Phu proved a watershed for the French withdrawal in 1954.<br />However, Pisor does not limit his work to strictly academic postulations.  He does weave the foot soldiers' account of the siege with his study of the global ramifications.  He describes the ferocity of the North Vietnamese and their frightening, suicidal charges in such a way that I am most thankful to be born a few years after the fall of Saigon.<br />In conclusion, this journalist from Detroit produced a most impressive and valuable work on the history of Vietnam, and the results of one of its most famous battles.	2003-06-25

I was expecting the usual political memoir that highlights the authors recognized accomplishments and exploited good deeds.  However, Kerrey's memoir was much more.  Very little was spent on Kerrey's political career, rather it was an honest recollection of his days as a young man growing up in a turbulent time.<br />The most impressive memories were those of his recovery from wounds suffered in Vietnam and the subsequent pain and guilt that accompanied him long after the war had ended.  He recalls this bitter time with an almost eerie honesty.  He discusses the guilt he felt for his role in the Vietnam war, and his disenchantment with the American political machine.  This paradox between war hero and disillusioned citizen shows the complexities of war, and life.<br />Kerrey's book displays a human side of politicians that is rarely seen, either because these emotions taint their image, or in the case of many politicians it doesn't exist. It is a terrible shame that more men like Bob Kerrey refrain from entering politics.  America would be a much better place.	2003-06-13

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Great Work On The Fall Of The Third Reich	Although a short book of less than two-hundred pages, Whiting did an excellent job chronicling the last two months of World War II.  Whiting began his history with allied forces making their final advance on Berlin.  It seems like the advance was accompanied by moments of peace and safety, coupled with moments of extreme and fanatical combat.  The Germans were facing two massive armies, the Soviets in the East, and the British and American forces in the West.  With no where to go, the Germans either attempted to surrender to the more hospitable Americans and British, or fought to the death against the Soviets.<br />I found the fall of Nazi Germany, and the subsequent power struggles that developed in order to gain control of the destroyed state most fascinating. Upon the death of Hitler, Grand Admiral Doenitz assumed command of the Reich. However, other top Nazi officials still wanted to maintain a certain level of pull with the new leader.  It seems that Whiting views Doenitz as a man more concerned with salvaging what was left of the Germany state rather than securing his own power.  Unfortunately, Eisenhower saw only one way to halt the allied assault, unconditional surrender.  Doenitz had no choice but to comply.<br />Aside from chronicling the battles for Northern Europe and Berlin, Whiting did a most impressive job discussing the geopolitical ramifications that followed the fall of Berlin.  For example, Churchill desperately wanted American forces to push as far East as possible in order to stem the Soviet land grab.  Eisenhower finally consented that the Soviets did prove a vast threat to the European continent, but by that time the Soviets had developed a strong foothold in Eastern Europe. Whiting also discussed the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the effect his death had on the Japanese theatre.  It seems that it is Whiting's contention that Truman's use of the atomic weapon was less about destroying the morale of the Japanese, and more about creating a fear in the Soviet Union.<br />Whiting's book is an excellent book, filled with insight and food for thought.  It is a shame that his work has been out of print from so long, but it would still be a wonderful piece for any World War II library.fear in the Soviet Union.<br />Whiting's book is an excellent book, filled with insight and food for thought.

It is impossible to explore the infinite interpretations that accompany each poem; however, this compilation, which includes some of Bukowski's earlier works deserves some words.<br />All too often Bukowski  is forced in to a literary box by those who have only read a brief snippet of his work.  They see him as a down and out drunk, with a penchant for the written word.  They fail to realize the greater depth of his poetry.  Yes, Bukowski lived a very hard life, however, the booze and the women and the flophouse rooms also serve as a metaphor, illustrating his  far-reaching insight into the world.<br />Through his poems, we see life through jaded eyes.  So jaded, in fact, as to prove enlightening.  From Bukowski's self-imposed exile from the daily grind, he is able to view the world of man objectively.  He is able to gain a realization of the absurdities that all too often dull the lives of many, and in this way, Bukowski brings forth a certain level of enlightenment.  Through his work, we too can view life objectively and combat the absurdities that plague us all.	2003-04-30

Not only is his research vast and impeccable, but Michener is able to translate his research into a wonderfully readable book.  The Bridge at Andau is no exception.<br />In the mid-1950's Michener was living in Austria, along the border with Hungary.  From this unique vantage point, he was able to observe the large exodus of Hungarians fleeing their communist nation.  His observations and discussions with these refugees brought many aspects of the communist regime to light.<br />He was able to bring the reader into a communist state and to reveal its inner workings, including how the government controlled the masses.  At the time, this was no easy task, as the Iron Curtain was nearly impenetrable to Westerners.  Nevertheless, Michener was able to piece together countless interviews with these refugees and create an accurate picture of life under the red flag.<br />He discussed nearly every facet of the politics of the Hungarian people.  He told of intellectuals beginning their theoretical revolution, and he told of the students who were the first to pick up arms against the police forces and Soviet army.  Michener also spoke of the workers, the bones of communism, and how they turned their back on the system and tried to destroy it.<br />Unfortunately, the revolution failed and the Hungarians were forced to flee or face dire repercussions.  And Michener was there to chronicle their tales.<br />The Bridge at Andau is a fascinating book and a document of Cold War history.  It is definitely worth reading.	2003-04-11

This book certainly spanned the gambit. Greenfeld's topics ranged from street racing motorcycle cliques to a socio-philosophical chapter regarding the Japanese fascination with technology.<br />Although lacking in any far-reaching theory on Japanese society, Greenfeld did write a series of interesting stories and anecdotes, some rife with humor, while others maintained a slightly melancholy vibe.  But, it was hard to accept his book as much more than simple stories.  It lacked any kind of journalistic bite.  The book read like a pseudo-compilation of tales regurgitated on to the printed page, following late-night booze sessions in some Tokyo bar.<br />All in all, it is a three star book.

Hersey brought to light the true horror that thrust humanity into the atomic age, Hiroshima.  Often, in the United States, we see the bombing of Hiroshima as a means to an end.  Some say the use of atomic weapons during World War II saved millions of American lives, and perhaps those sentiments are true. However atomic weapons have also brought Americans to the doorstep of hell all too often. It wasnt so long ago that Kennedy and Khrushchev stared down the barrel of nuclear annihilation, both holding the fate of humanity in the palms of their hands.<br />Oppenheimer was right. Following the first atomic test, he recited words from the Bhagavad-Gita, Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.  And in a way, he had become death.  He opened a Pandoras box that can never be resealed.<br />Since we are destined to live with the threat of nuclear weapons, it is all we can do to attempt to halt the proliferation and use of said weapons. Herseys book reveals the havoc that even the smallest atomic weapon can cause.  Today, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima is nothing more than a childs cherry bomb, compared to the multi-megaton warheads that point across national boarders.  And this revelation is what makes Herseys book so important.  It gives us a taste of what is to come if we cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.	2003-03-13

Yes, we often hear tales of the horrors of a winter invasion in Russia, and of Hitler's faults in directing the campaign, but we seldom hear a first person account of the conflict on the Russian steppes.  I knew the battle for Stalingrad was full of blood and violence, but Koschorrek's work brought the actual sights of frontline combat to the fore.  His descriptions of waves of Russian soldiers assaulting his machine gun position, and the incessant barrage of artillery shells draws a chilling reminder of the utter horror  and destruction faced on all sides during WW II.<br />I also found the records of Koschorrek's growing disillusionment with Hitler and his Nazi party very enlightening.  As a frontline soldier, Koschorrek doesn't claim to have been an expert on the political situation in Germany.  Many times he announces that he was fighting for the German people, rather than the Third Reich.  And towards the end of his extremely long time on the Eastern Front, Koschorrek claims only to be fighting for his fellow soldiers.  It must have been a terrible struggle to continue on in a failing attempt to capture Stalingrad, and then endure a savage retreat all the way to the gates of Berlin.  To see one's homeland utterly destroyed would be terrible in itself, but then to realize this destruction was caused by the ideas of a madman would almost be too terrible to bear.  Koschorrek's book serves as yet another good reminder of the lunacy and horror that is war.<br />The one disappointment I found in Koschorrek's book was the writing.  Although I understand that he was probably attempting to vanquish some long standing demons, the use of a co-author would have made the book more readable.  His complete use of first person narration, at times, becomes trying.  I see that he was attempting to retain the vision of frontline life as it happened, but this reader would have rather seen him use some other literary methods in order to bring more cohesion to the story.

It seems that the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia etc.  completely eclipsed the African tragedy so well captured by Fergal Keane.  I like to think that armed with more information, Western Powers would have intervened in order to halt the tribal savagery organized by both the Hutus and Tutsis. In reality, however, Western powers continue to see Africa as a backwards and barbarous continent, more fit for colonization than development.<br />Keane did a remarkable job of bringing the Rwandan tragedy to light.  As a renowned BBC correspondent, Keane has witnessed reprehensible tragedies, disasters, and acts of inhumane conduct that most of us will never (hopefully) ever bear witness to.  And although Keane has seen the worst of mankind, in a variety of instances, it seems that what he saw in Rwanda left lasting and troubling memories.<br />The book is relatively short, only 200 pages, but it certainly leaves its mark on the reader.  The graphic descriptions are intense, but Keane's insight into not only the Rwandan situation, but into the minds of those who participated in the horror is startling as well.  We certainly need more authors like Keane, who delve into the loathsomeness of man and bring forth the lessons that we all should heed.	2003-02-20

Although the work is geared towards a younger audience, the quality of writing, and information contained are quality fare for an older audience as well.<br />Shirer, begins his work with a young disgruntled Hitler, arguing with his father over his chosen profession, that of an artist.  Shirer then chronicles Hitler's days as a vagabond, moving from one odd job to another across Austria and Germany.  In these early years, we see Hitler not as a maniacal demagogue, but as an eccentric wanderer, searching for nothing in particular.  However, World War I brought the demagogue forth.<br />After serving for four years in the Germany military, Hitler, disgruntled with the Treaty of Versailles and the weakness of the German nation decides to enter into political life.  It is in a small beer hall that Hitler creates the new found Nazi party and enlists the help of such infamous men as Goering, Himmler, and Hess.  Do to Hitler's exceptional charisma, the Nazi party begins to grow.<br />Following the now infamous \\"Beer Hall Putsch,\\" Hitler is imprisoned and begins work on his seminal book, Mein Kampf.  Following his release, the book sells millions of copies and Hitler is thrust upon the national stage.  From here, Shirer illustrates Hitler's rise of Chancellor, and ultimately dictator of Germany.  He discusses the serious of invasions and coups conducted under Hitler throughout Europe and subsequent intervention of the Allied Powers.<br />Finally, Shirer chronicles the decline of Hitler, and his subsequent decent in to madness.  His paranoia, greed, and ultimate refusal of accept anything other than total victory led to not only the demise of Adlof Hitler, but also to the German nation.<br />Shirer did an excellent job chronicling the life of Adlof Hitler in a short and concise book.

Rather than only concentrate on the battles and strategies of Rommel, Young provided insight into the opinions of the General in regards to Hitler, the Nazi party, and other aspects of WWII.<br />According to Young, Rommel was a private man, devoted to his family and to the German people.  His commitment to Germany was shown quite clearly when he encouraged the Fuehrer to seek a peaceful solution to the war in order to save the lives of his soldiers and German citizens.  However, his commitments ultimately cost Rommel his life.<br />However, I wish Young would have provided more in-depth information regarding the major battles in which Rommel participated.

He exposes the deeper truths that guide nations' foreign policy agendas. His article, Aggressive Liberalism, illustrates the two-sidedness of American foreign policy, citing the numerous acts of unchecked aggression that the U.S. has unleashed on smaller, weaker nations.  One of the most interesting thoughts expounded by Zinn is the belief held by many Americans that the U.S.  is seeking to improve the interests of these occupied nations through the use of American imperialism.<br /> However, Zinn doesn't overtly slam the &quot;American way of life,&quot; or the institutions of America.  Rather Zinn makes his statements through careful study and cites irrefutable evidence supplied by history in supporting his claims.<br /> Although Zinn is a dissident that sticks in the craw of more conservative America, his essays and article provide much food for thought, regardless of ones position on the political spectrum.  This collection will certainly fuel discussion on a variety of topics.	2003-02-04

He could make hate and pain beautiful.  Bukowski had a magic way of twisting emotions into poems of unimaginable shapes.  Each poetic flash serving as a portal into one man's interpretation of life.  And that, I think, impresses me most about Bukowski.  There is no pretension.  His work... simply is.  Mocking Bird came out in 1979 and some readers commented that B. was going soft.  What they fail to realize is that people evolve.  Bukowski was still Bukowski, but perhaps his poet eyes began to see some different shades of gray.  And we certainly can't fault him for that.  .	2003-01-30

As a student of Socrates, it seems that Plato, through his own writings, attempts to preserve the memory of his well respected teacher.<br />In The Last Days of Socrates, Plato begins with Euthyphro and we see the Socratic method in action.  Socrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety, and through a serious of thought provoking questions, Socrates argues for what he feels is the proper relationship between Man and God.<br />Next, Plato discusses the trial of Socrates by the Athenian aristocracy.  Again, we see Socrates using his rhetorical skills in illustrating the hypocrisy and prejudice pervading throughout the Athenian government.  Socrates discusses what role a good citizen should play in government.  He announces his being a \\"gadfly\\" on the hide of the establishment, and we also find Socrates exposing his own intelligence by claiming that he, in fact, knows very little.  The Apology is by far my personal favorite section of the book.<br />After Socrates conviction, we find him discussing the morality of obeying or breaking laws in Crito.  He meets with one of his close friends and the two discuss Socrates' options in regard to his death sentence.  Here we see Socrates espouse the belief that it is acceptable to break an unjust law, however, one must also accept the consequences for breaking said law in order to preserve the stability of society.<br />The Last Days of Socrates tackles many complex issues which are as relevant today as they were when first committed to paper in the 4th century B.C.  This should be standard reading for any introductory course in political theory, and a must have for anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.	2003-01-23

It is nice to see that Thompson has maintained his scathing wit and cynicism after living through the majority of the \\"American century.\\"  Never has he kowtowed to the establishment nor sacrificed his unique style of social commentary. Through the years, Thompson has done battle, both with his pen and in person, with some of the most heinous individuals in history, i.e. Richard Nixon, George W. Bush, Hells Angles, etc.  Often these confrontations make for excellent anecdotes and interesting takes on society.<br />Kingdom of Fear is a chronicle of Thompson's years of work as journalist, social critic, and defender of personal freedom.  HST recounts his coverage of the invasion of Grenada and the fall of Saigon, his ill-fated political run for Sheriff, and his disillusionment of American politics following the Chicago convention '68.  However, the book is not simply a memoir.  Thompson shows that his pen is as sharp as ever when he attacks the current Bush administration and American foreign policy.<br />All in all, Kingdom of Fear and one of Thompson's best.  Good work Doc.	2003-01-10

He offers a first hand account of the terrible Peloponnesian war that plagued Greece for over thirty-years. Not only does he discuss the war between Athens and Sparta, but also he gives a very informative description of Greek life and history leading up to the war.<br />Thucydides discusses the early war with the Persians and the subsequent power-vacuum left in Greece following the conclusion of the conflict.  He discusses the merits of both the Athenian League and their Spartan counter parts, thus remaining objective even though having served as an Athenian general. His knowledge of battles is profound, but more interesting is his discussion on the politics of Greece at the time.<br />He makes great use of political dialogues in order to emphasize important aspects of the conflict and the Grecian political situation. Especially interesting are Pericles' funeral oration, and the Melian dialogue. Both dialogues deal with matters of state, i.e. the good citizen, and realist thought towards nationalist interest.<br /> Through Thucydides work we are able to draw numerous parallels from antiquity to modern times.  Thucydides has almost perfectly captured current international politics on miniature scale, making observation and study most beneficial to those interested in learning the underlying processes of global affairs.  I recommend a close reading of The Peloponnesian War for any student of political science or for anyone interested in Ancient History.  A most fascinating read.	2002-12-17

Corporate literati ...strike again.<br />Since I already have Ham On Rye, Post Office, South Of No North, and numerous volumes of Bukowski poetry, this biography really is obsolete.  It seems like Cherkovski pasted together snippets of the Bukowski collection, and added some of his own limited insights, placed the whole conglomeration between a cover and shipped it off to market.<br />Anyone who has read even a limited amount of Bukowski's work will find nothing new in this biography.  Save your money and purchase Buk's poetry.  I recommend Bone Palace Ballet, or The Night Torn Made With Footsteps.	2002-12-12

Sadly, the sheer size of most of his celebrated works, i.e. War and Peace, tend to make many readers anxious.  However, readers fail to realize that Tolstoy has quite a phenomenal collection of short fiction, such as this 178-page novella.<br />Tolstoy explores the dissatisfaction a young Russian aristocrat holds towards the emptiness of high-society, and his subsequent journey in search of meaning.  The aristocrat finds himself as a young Russian army officer, serving at a remote Cossack outpost in the Caucasus. Here he finds that his wealth and breeding do not garner him respect. Instead he is looked upon as an outsider, and an unwelcome one at that.<br />Nevertheless, the aristocrat finds himself in love with a beautiful Cossack girl, who is promised to a Cossack warrior.  Tolstoy discusses the emotions that rise between these three parties regarding love, class, and sacrifice.<br />Indeed, The Cossacks is great first exposure to Leo Tolstoy and his descriptive writing style is sure to lead the reader to explore more of his works.	2002-11-26

I was not looking to read the memoir of an assassin and torturer. Although the book did not provide much in the way of history, it did provoke much thought about terrorism, colonization, and to what lengths a nation is willing to go in order to crush terrorism...or rebellion (depending on one's definition).<br />During the 1950's, numerous North African nations were granted independence from colonial rule, but France maintained a hard-line in regards to Algeria.  After Tunisia was granted independence, nationalists throughout Algeria began to attack French citizens, properties, and government troops in the hopes of securing their own freedom.  General Aussaresses was given the task of stopping the attacks on French citizens living in Algeria, and subsequently destroy the nationalists as an entity.<br />The majority of the book discusses how Aussaresses developed a program of executions, assassinations, and torture in order to stop the FLN.  He discusses how his secret mission was hidden from the majority of the French populous and even from some major government officials.  Then, the book abruptly ends, with out giving the reader a real conclusion.  There is no real explanation as to what occurred following the departure of Aussaresses, or what happened to Algeria as a nation.  Certainly an epilogue would have been appreciated.<br />Nevertheless, the book did provide food for thought.  How does a nation fight terrorism?  It would seem that Aussaresses would argue that we fight terror with terror.  Kidnapping and summary executions solve the dilemma, Aussaresses would say.  But with the use of these tactics, a different dilemma arises.  Who is the terrorist when both parties act so similarly?	2002-11-22

It is not, nor intended to be, summer &quot;beach reading.&quot;  That said, I must say that Ching did a very good job writing a book that would be a wonderful accompaniment to a college course on either Chinese religion, or Chinese philosophy.  She begins chronologically with the &quot;Indigenous Traditions&quot; of China and progresses through Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and finally the integration of Christian and Islamic influence in Chinese religion.<br />Ching discusses the uniqueness of the Chinese religion, in that it is a conglomeration of many different religious and philosophical influences, and she illustrates how these many influences have come to form a synchronistic relationship between many schools of thought.<br />If I could make two suggestions to Julia Ching, they would be to add a chapter on the rise of Falun Gong in China, and the subsequent oppression by the Communist Party. Secondly, add some excerpts from the religious texts she cites in her work.  I'm sure this would add clarity.	2002-11-03

Cuneo does a respectable job of researching a host of different forms of exorcism in America, and his accounts do prove interesting.  He performs a first hand examination of a host of theological [excentrics], from evangelical snake handlers, to Catholic priests who exchange blows with the devil himself.  However, it's clear that Cuneo puts very little merit in any of these exorcisms, and one can see his conclusions almost from the first page.<br />I think the book would have been much improved if Cuneo delved deeper in to the history of American exorcism.  For example, a chapter or two about the Salem witch trials or other \\"exorcisms\\" from the distant past of American history would have given the book the bite it lacks. Although the book was slightly entertaining, it would be easy to skip over.	2002-11-03

He begins with a description of a state, advances through the numerous types of constitutions, describes the ideal citizen, and defines good government-not to mention numerous other fascinating political insights into the running of a state.<br />Aristotle's outline for government and state has been influential to political scientists for over 2,400 years.  His discussion on the cons of complete unity, as well as his chapter on &quot;the natural and unnatural methods of acquiring goods,&quot; certainly must have influenced Karl Marx, and his discussions on the &quot;good of all&quot; certainly led to Mills and Bentham's utilitarianism.<br />The Penguin Classics edition gives the reader an authoritative, inexpensive copy that is ideal for scholars as well as students.  The footnotes are helpful, but not excessive.  An excellent purchase all around.	2002-11-02

And as such, his work documents a time in Soviet (as well as world) history that is often overlooked by younger Western eyes.  For those of my generation, born after 1978, the Cold War lacks the menace and frightening magnitude that it conveyed for over forty years.  With the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1991, the history of Soviet Russia has evaporated from popular thought and has left a gaping whole in the education of American youth.  U.S. schools fail to illustrate that the Soviet Union was an empire that spanned seventy-four years, and nearly controlled half of the world.<br />Fortunately, One Day In The Life... brings the history of this deceased giant to bear.  Solzhenitzyn sheds light on what was occurring behind &quot;The Iron Curtain.&quot;  His discussion of the infamous Gulag and the oppression of individual thought allows the reader insight into why some people were so utterly fearful of a &quot;Communist&quot; takeover.  I was most impressed how Solzhenitzyn refrained from making an outward assault on Communist philosophy and instead concentrated on the misdeeds of the Soviet Union as a state.  He allowed the reader to form his or her own opinions on the merits of collectivist thought, and instead recited his memoirs of living in the Soviet Union.<br />This was a very impressive, short novel, and should be considered required reading for high school history classes when discussion the Cold War or Soviet history.	2002-10-13

If that were the case, perhaps war could even be looked at as somewhat civilized.  However, most atrocities fall upon innocent victims.  Rape and murder, the destruction of homes and livelihoods, dislocation, all fall on the shoulders of those who would most likely wish that the war quietly passed them by.<br />Aside from the victims on the receiving end of heinous atrocities, we must also consider the scared psyche and irreparable lives of those caught up in the insanity of war and commit said atrocities.<br />For example, the main culprit in Casualties was barley twenty-years old, and he was saddled with responsibilities that are meant to be held by gods.  He decided who lived and who died. It was his duty to preserve the lives of his men, while extinguishing the lives of this \\"enemies.\\" This power is almost beyond the realm of human comprehension, let alone the young mind of a man-child. Who among us can claim to be certain that after witnessing numerous deaths, usually occurring in the most horrific fashion, that we wouldn't react in much the same way?<br />War is a horrible and unpredictable beast.  And once unleashed, this beast will wreak unspeakable, and reprehensible damage.  This damage will forever scar the world in which we live.  Not only will the lives, land, and economic aspects die, but also society dies every time war is waged.  And eventually society itself will die.<br />This is the lesson we can gather from Lang's provocative book.  We learn that the casualties of war are not always left on the battlefield, but continue for as long as war exists.	2002-10-11

It was only a few short years later that Senator Joe McCarthy's HUAC witch-hunts created a dark blemish on American history.<br />Sadly, the philosophy of Ayn Rand and others like her may have led, in a small way, to the paranoia that led to these \\"witch-hunts\\" and the tortured lives of many innocent Americans.  Ayn Rand paints a picture of totalitarianism, and a world of oppression completely void of human spirit. This is not the \\"spirit\\" of Communism or other forms of collectivism.  Now, if she intended to portray the totalitarian Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin's purges in this manner, she has done superb job.<br />But, she did not provide a far portrayal of collectivist philosophy.  If she wants to attack philosophies in opposition to her own objectivism, she should also attack Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism and other forms of utopianism.<br />Although my political beliefs are obviously opposite of those of Ayn Rand, I must admit that I found her writing style quite intriguing and very effective in persuading the reader to ingest the opinions that she is trying to espouse.  Regardless, of one's political affiliation Anthem is indeed a very good and thought provoking novel.	2002-10-10

Bernard Goldberg, a twenty-plus year veteran of the news media, made an observation and turned it into a conviction. Throughout the course of his book, Mr. Goldberg proves time and again that a liberal bias in the media does indeed exist and this bias is damaging the legitimacy of journalism, both in print and on television. However, Mr. Goldberg does not blame the media entirely for this biased reporting, but instead places the blame more on a society that has become so concerned with being politically correct, that is has failed to accept some of the stark realities that are indeed factual, honest, albeit frightening.  Goldberg's book was filled with interesting examples of ways in which network television news twists and turns their reporting in order to convey a specific, biased, message, and ultimately mask the stark realities noted above.  One aspect of the book that grew wearisome was Goldberg's personal attacks against the network news organizations, and in particular their major anchormen.  Mr. Goldberg's animosities are obvious, and probably justified, but these attacks began to draw away from Goldberg's message and gave the impression that the book was retribution for his poor treatment by CBS rather than a voice citing a wrong.	2002-08-02
