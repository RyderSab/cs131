Doesn't the balanced scorecard work in practice?    David Niven is an expert on Balanced Scorecard and his first book was an easy-to-read, well-structured manual of how to make scorecards work: \\"Balanced scorecard - step-by-step\\" (2002). It bridged the gap between practice and theory - especially for newcomers to the concept.    In this new book, Niven tries to bridge another emerging gap. It is the gap between those questioning the usefulness of balanced scorecard, based on the many unsuccessful implementation attempts, and what people like Niven (and I) believe to be reality: that the scorecard framework remains sound, but must be instituted with rigor and discipline if you expect to get results.    Why aren't many scorecard users happy?  Niven believes that the trouble lies in the methods used to implement the Balanced Scorecard. Many firms have been lured by the seductive simplicity of the scorecard model, believing it could be easily implemented and produce results with a minimum of care and feeding. According to Niven, troubled implementations stem from many sources, e.g.   - A lack of executive sponsorship to reinforce the Scorecard's value within the organization,   - Tired [lagging] metrics reflecting the past with no regard to the drivers of future success, and  - Management systems that continue to reward unbalanced, largely financial, performance    How do we solve it?  Niven's approach is basically to put Kaplan and Norton's five principles of the \\"Strategy-Focused Organization\\" (2001) into a more practical approach. The messages, obviously, are the same. But Niven manages to make it easier to comprehend. And he challenges the reader throughout the book. The diagnostics dimension of the book is furthermore incorporated at the end of each of the nine chapters where we find self-assessment questions.    This week I went to a conference in Copenhagen where Harvard-professor Robert Kaplan spoke about the balanced scorecard. Kaplan, being one of the inventors, acknowledged that too many balanced scorecards did not succeed. It is a paradox, since the balanced scorecard was incepted to overcome to problem that strategies weren't properly implemented. But if the system (or scorecard) to finally make the strategy implementation work doesn't work either, then we're in real trouble. So is the concept, of course.    Kaplan's suggestion to make a successful implementation of the scorecard is - like Niven's - to view it as a change project. The change programme goes thru three phases: mobilization (unfreezing), alignment (change), and sustainment (re-freezing). Kaplan specified the details as described below:    1st phase: MOBILIZATION (\\"the case for change\\"):  Principle: #1 Mobilize change thru Executive leadership  Leadership objective: Achieve commitment at the top, build the executive team, and build the case for change  Core competency: The catalyst's role is to be a missionary. The action list includes to advocate, to educate, and to sell a new way of managing.  Management role: Executive education (the need for strategic execution) via conferences, in-house workshops, and readings.    2nd phase: ALIGNMENT (\\"early wins\\")  Principle: #2 translate the strategy into action, #3 align the organization.  Leadership objective: Define and clarify the strategy, specify long-term targets, and communicate to workforce  Core competency: The project team's role is as consultant and change agent. The action list includes to design strategy maps, to design scorecards/targets, to create alignment/cascade, and to overcome resistance.  Management role: Strategy maps, balanced scorecards, First Report, Link business and support groups to the strategy, and to rationalize initiatives    3rd phase: SUSTAINMENT (\\"irreversible momentum\\")  Principle: #4 Motivate the staff, #5 Govern the Organization  Leadership objective: Reinforce strategic message: Employees follow the leader, Enforce a performance-based culture: get results, and Lead the new management meeting  Core competency: The office of strategy management's role is to be the \\"chief of staff\\" (like in the military and government). The action list includes to install accountability, to shape the executive agenda, and to integrate governance.  Management role: Scorecard reporting system, HR processes aligned, Accountability and rewards aligned, and meetings focused on scorecard objectives and measures.      If you're interested in Balanced Scorecard, you should obviously read the original work by Kaplan and Norton. But I also recommend a very capable book by the Swedes Olve et al (2003) - \\"Making Scorecards Actionable: Balancing Strategy and Control\\" - that also focuses on why balanced scorecards go wrong - and what to do about it.     If you're even more interested in performance measurement systems, then do also consider \\"Performance Prism\\" by Neely et al (2002) that takes performance systems to the next level. Personally, I don't believe they've designed balanced scorecard's successor, but they have many interesting perspectives on stakeholders, choice of measurements, and the relationship between cause and effect.

It is about ERP systems ... or Enterprise Systems (ES) as Davenport calls them.    If you're interested in the STRATEGIC issues of ERP systems, then you'll learn that there are surprisingly few books on this topic on the market.    Davenport's contributions are the best that I've found. Especially, I found his discussion of implementation approaches on speed and focus (quick relief vs. long-term competitiveness) interesting. Also his perspectives on \\"after the implementation\\" were far ahead of his time. In addition, his considerations on the implementation plan's options on scope and function (process phasing vs. big bang vs. geographical or business unit phasing) are illustrative.    Perhaps Davenport's book could be better structured, but considering the quality of the arguments in the text, I can live with it. Content before structure. Five stars!    Peter Drucker wrote in 1999 \\"we have spend the last 50 years on the T in IT, we need to spend the next 50 years on the I in IT\\". If you read Davenport's book, you'll be better prepared to capture the information part than the technology part in ERP systems.     If you're interested in the more tactical and operational issues of ERP systems, then buy Brady's \\"Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning\\" (2001) and Hamilton's \\"Maximizing your ERP System - A practical guide for managers [in manufacturing firms]\\" (2002). I also recommend Kalakota's \\"E-Services\\" (2003) that takes the full concept of the next step for an extended ERP system (including Multi-Channel Customer Relationship Management, Supply Chain Management, Product Lifecycle Management, Employee and Business Partner Collaboration, etc). Finally I have to mention \\"Why ERP? A Primer on SAP Implementation\\" by Jacobs and Whybark. It's a wonderful little book - actually a business novel - on ERP systems. I read it twice ... before entering a job as e-business manager with SAP R/3 as back-end system.Great help.

The approach is a practical step-by-step procedure with the same specific case study throughout the book (\\"FireFly Toys\\"). At the end of the book, there's an alternative case study - including Powerpoint presentation - on another industry (\\"Fossa Medical\\"). Both case studies' 4-page executive summaries should inspire each and every manager to present his venture or business in this concise and exemplary manner...    It is indeed a no-nonsense guidebook and I especially like the small critical comments that the authors have inserted in the margins (as speech balloons).    Being a corporate strategist, I spend most of my time working with strategic issues including business plans. So I read a book on this topic with a subtle skepticism. But it was a pleasant surprise ;-)    Thus, I can highly recommend this easy-to-read 183-page book.

This book is about why big, established companies should aim to be \\"Fast Second\\" rather than pioneers of radically new markets.    The authors challenge the new hypothesis that big firms need to be \\"ambidextrous\\" (i.e. able to use either hand with equal skill). An ambidextrous organization has successfully put in place multiple, contradictory structures, processes, and cultures within the same organizational infrastructure. By developing strong shared values and by putting in charge managers capable of managing variety and ambiguity, ambidextrous organizations can successfully balance the conflicting demands that the simultaneous pursuit of being First Mover (or colonizer) and being Fast Second (or consolidator) would place on them.     The skills, competencies, mindsets, and attitudes needed to succeed as a First Mover versus a Fast Second are like chalk and cheese. From First Mover to Fast Second, these are the 16 differences according to the authors:  1. From engineering or technology skills TO marketing, customer segmentation, and retailing skills  2. From emphasis on novelty, quality, and focus on lead users TO understanding of average user needs, good at spotting consensus  3. From young, restless, fascinated with science, technology, and the leading edge TO more interested in making money than in developing the latest technological wonder  4. From roots in science TO commercial roots  5. From focus on technological achievements and creating the best-performing product TO focus on price and quality and willing to settle for a product that is \\"good enough\\"  6. From manage information network in science community TO manage network of feeder entrepreneurial firms  7. From entrepreneurs who prefer autonomy and freedom and do not want to work in a big company TO organization people, happy within the structures and constraints of a large organization  8. From fast, agile, risk-taking experiments TO people who defend the existing business and don't take unnecessary risks  9. From entrepreneurial culture TO functional organization, formal management control systems  10. From first, fast mover TO judicious mover  11. From small is beautiful TO need resources to build the brand and distribution  12. From good at management of product design TO mastery of process engineering, procurement expertise, and mass-market management  13. From a culture of innovation and experimentation TO a culture of discipline and cost-control  14. From flexible TO disciplined  15. From short-term oriented TO long-term oriented  16. From fluid structures that allow easy flow of ideas and learning from mistakes TO managed hierarchy, focusing on mass marketing, customer segmentation, and manufacturing excellence    Not only are the necessary skills for each activity different, they also CONFLICT with each other. This means that firms that are good at being First Mover are unlikely to be good at being Fast Second. Looking at the list above, it's obvious that big firms have the skills and mindsets to be good Fast Second market players. Trying to teach them the skills of a First Mover will not usually work because their existing skills conflict with many of the skills they need to develop. Big firms should focus on what they are good at - the consolidation of radical markets into mass markets (Fast Second). They can achieve this by adopting an acquisition or network strategy with young start-up firms.    I got the book from Amazon the other day and finished it last night. It usually takes longer to read a strategy book, but this one is slim with only 170 pages. Being a business development manager, the topic of strategic innovation is very familiar and the arguments are surprisingly clear ... and very thought provoking, indeed. I'll highly recommend this book. It's a bold challenge to the conventional wisdom of the need to build radical innovation competence for big firms. It makes you rethink what you aim for ...    If you're interested in strategic innovation, do also consider Kim & Mauborgne's \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\", Slywotzky's \\"How to Grow When Markets Don't\\", and Markides' \\"All the Right Moves\\".

Why do website conversion rates remain at a gloomy 2-5 per cent?    \\"Call for Action\\" focuses on how we can improve the conversion rates. Not from a technical or academic or conceptual standpoint. Instead it takes a rare PRACTICAL and down-to-earth approach on how to improve conversion rates to improve sales and thus profits.     What is CONVERSION? Virtually all websites have a persuasive purpose; to get someone to subscribe, to register, to inquire or to buy something. And if all we get is 2-5 per cent conversion, we ought to review our website. Do we offer a product or service that could meet the needs of more than 2-5 per cent of the market? Can visitors find that, solution on the website? Do they understand our offer's value? Was it made at the right time? Are we sure they're coming back?    NAVIGATION is the biggest challenge websites face, the authors argue. The issues are: What to do with the traffic once it lands on the website? How to get visitors to take the first action and click deeper? And once there, how to induce visitors to click to the next step, and the next, and the next?     The fundamental idea is that a PERSUASIVE ARCHITECTURE links a visitor's buying experience to our company's sales process. It bridges the buy/sell process in a measurable way. If you can influence visitor behaviour and empathize with visitor motivations, you can influence results to provide a better experience and more frequent, effective conversions.    The book is filled with illustrative screen dumps of websites (before and after a change). This is a great benefit of such a how-to field book on e-commerce improvements. In my opinion, most e-commerce sites can recover the book's cost price in a few days just by following one or two of the practical suggestions in the many diverse case studies.    The primary focus of this book is e-Commerce. The key messages on conversion, however, are important to anyone running a large website.    This is a rare book. I've been involvedin e-commerce since 1997 and read many interesting books on this topic. But I've never found such a practical approach to optimising e-commerce web sites as this one.    The brothers Eisenberg call themselves \\"wizards of web\\". I agree and hope my existing and future competitors don't read and act on this book. These secret formulas to improve online results are very effective, indeed.    If you're looking for a conceptual e-commerce theory, please look somewhere else. This is about the nuts and bolts about making money with an e-commerce web site. If you don't have or don`t plan to have such a website; forget about this book. Then it's a waste of time.    I also recommend Jakob Nielsen's books on web usability and Steve Krug's easy-to-read \\"Don't make me think\\".

The authors Slywotzky and Morrison are renowned for their inspiring bestseller \\"Profit Zones\\" in which they elaborate on 22 different profit models for businesses. In this book on digital business design they explain how to design the 23rd profit model. <br /> <br />Digital Business Design is the art of using digital technologies to expand a company's strategic options. It is not about technology for its own sake; it's about serving customers, creating unique value propositions, leveraging talent, radically improving productivity, and increasing profits. It's about using digital options to craft a business model that is not only superior, but also unique. <br /> <br />Until recently, the probability that any organization would enjoy long-term success was determined by a single factor: the quality of its business design. Today, the multiplication of digital technologies has introduced a second crucial competitive factor: the degree of its relevant digitization. <br /> <br />FOUR-QUADRANT \\"MAP\\" <br />Any organization can be mapped into a four-quadrant \\"map\\" based on its level of digitization and its business design: <br />* Low digitization, bad business design (Southwest quadrant - \\"Weak Business Designs\\"). <br />* High digitization, bad business design (Northwest quadrant - \\"The Dotcoms\\"). <br />* Low digitization, great business design (Southeast quadrant - \\"Business Design Reinventors\\"). <br />* High digitization, great business design (Northeast quadrant - \\"Digital Business Design\\"). <br /> <br />YOUR DIGITAL RATIO <br />One important aspect of moving from a conventional to a Digital Business Design involves shifting many of your company's key activities from paper-based processes to digital (usually on-line) processes. To obtain at least a partial measure of how digital your business is, complete a simple exercise referred to as estimating your Digital Ratio. The authors suggest that you measure the following processes [0-100% digital]: selling, delivery, supplychain, customer service, billing, buying, recruiting, training, finance, R&D, manufacturing, and marketing.  <br /> <br />Moving towards 100% digital is not an end in itself. Any decision to move a particular activity toward the right, and how far, depends on your key business issues, what is required to improve your value proposition for your customers and employees, and the capital and process efficiencies of your business. <br /> <br />On the surface, Digital Business Design indicates how many of your business processes are conducted on-line. At a deeper level, it tells whether you've transformed the way you do business by taking advantage of the new strategic options enabled by digital technologies. <br /> <br />THE DIGITAL BUSINESS DESIGN BENEFITS SCALE <br />Figuring your Digital Ratio is a useful exercise; for many companies, it will be a sobering one. But it only scratches the surface of what Digital Business Design really means. The experience of the digital innovators shows that Digital Business Design can fundamentally change the way you do business. It enables you to make a dramatic, positive shift toward implementing the benefits: <br /> <br />1. FROM GUESSING TO KNOWING. The basis of your business decision-making shifts from guessing to knowing. <br /> <br />2. FROM MISMATCH TO A PERFECT FIT. The value proposition you offer to your customers shifts from a mismatch (great or small) to a perfect fit. <br /> <br />3. FROM LAG TIME TO REAL TIME. Information flow within your company shifts from lag time to real time. <br /> <br />4. FROM SUPPLIER SERVICE TO CUSTOMER SELF-SERVICE. Your customer service model shifts from supplier service to customer self-service. <br /> <br />5. FROM LOW VALUE-ADDED WORK TO MAXIMUM TALENT LEVERAGE. The use of your employees' time shifts from predominantly low value-added work to maximum talent leverage. <br /> <br />6. FROM FIXING ERRORS TO PREVENTING ERRORS. Your processes shift from a focus on fixing errors to preventing them. <br /> <br />7. FROM 10% IMPROVEMENT TO 10X PRODUCTIVITY. Your productivity growth pattern shifts from a norm of 10 percent improvement to 10 times productivity. <br /> <br />8. FROM SEPARATE SILOS TO INTEGRATED SYSTEM. Your organization shifts from a collection of separate silos to an integrated system in which information, ideas, and solutions are shared. <br /> <br />The authors make a strong point of emphasizing that being digital is not only about the Internet (e-mail, e-commerce, e-services, etc.), but also all the other great things we do to MOVE FROM ATOMS TO BITS, e.g. empowering people and organizations via PCs, networks, ERP systems, etc. <br /> <br />Beware that Slywotzky in his marvellous business novel \\"Art of Profitability\\" (2002) becomes more reluctant to the concept of a \\"digital business design\\" as a 23rd profit model. So the verdict is still out on the digital profit model...  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, most businesses must continually evaluate which of their business processes that profitably should be transformed from paper-based to digital. But this may just be part of an organization's operational excellence, not necessarily a new profit model ... <br /> <br />In 2005, the cases in the book (Cisco, Schwab, Dell, IBM, GE, etc.) are too well-known to stimulate current readers. That is why I only rate the book three stars. <br /> <br />Being a business development manager, I search for relevant tools to apply the new ideas to my own business. At the website for this book - HowDigitalIsYourBusiness.com -, you'll find excellent \\"Tours\\" to two case studies and two presentations on Bit Engine and Choiceboards. <br /> <br />Peter Leerskov,  <br />MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2005-04-12

This pioneering book represents some of his best thoughts on business and corporate strategy.  <br /> <br />Chapter 1 is a summary of his first landmark book - \\"Competitive Strategy\\". So if you just want to buy one of his bestsellers, then buy \\"Competitive Advantage\\".  <br /> <br />The book's most important contribution is the concept of the VALUE CHAIN. Today, you won't find an MBA who doesn't know this idea. This book gives you all the details on the value chain. And it even tells you exactly how the value chain is translated into his two generic strategies: Cost Leadership and Differentiation. Most strategy books devote a separate chapter to this idea. If you want to get a more than a superficial understanding of the value chain, you simply have to read Porter's book.  <br /> <br />This book also gets to the core of how synergies are created and when diversification might work. Curiously, Porter chooses the term interrelationships for synergies (you know, a term for a nice idea that rarely occurred in practice...).  <br /> <br />Being a business development manager, I have strategic thinking as part of my key areas. This book is still a reference guide for me. Obviously though, Porter's views cannot stand-alone.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for critical views on Porter's ideas, then consider buying Hamel & Prahalad's \\"Competing for the Future\\" (1994) or Kim & Mauborgne's \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" (2005).  <br /> <br />Beware: You have to read Porter's Harvard Business review article \\"What is Strategy\\" from 1996, if you want his own response to the critics.  <br /> <br />Warning: You cannot work seriously with strategy without having understood Michael Porter's core concepts. And the superficial introduction by most - even advanced - strategy books won't make you competent enough to apply his ideas skilfully. Let me give you two examples:  <br /> <br />COST STRUCTURE:  <br />Most MBAs have learned about the value chain and cost structure analysis. But in real life I've seen very few who combine these two concepts proficiently. The real beauty in benchmarking cost structures is when you skilfully apply it to the value chain. This book tells you exactly how to do this. In practice, I've seen this approach applied very few times (except advanced strategy consultants). It may be because people often use Porter's concepts too casually...  <br /> <br />COST DRIVERS:  <br />Most strategy books are on drivers of differentiation - the preferred strategy choice by management gurus. And Porter does indeed help you on this issue. More importantly, this book is one of the few to tell you about the cost drivers. How many books have you read on Cost Leadership? Porter elaborates on 10 cost drivers, such as economies of scale, learning, linkages, synergies, pattern of capacity utilization, integration, timing, policies, and location.  <br /> <br />STRATEGY IS ABOUT BEING DIFFERENT. Start out personally by reading the real thing ... it's a bargain.  <br /> <br />Peter Leerskov,  <br />MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2005-04-11

This is one of them. And it's very good.    The central DILEMMA of Kasanoff's book is this:  No one can enjoy the benefits of personalization if he is not willing to share the personal information necessary to make those benefits possible. And yet, by sharing that information, the person is risking his privacy in the bargain.     And the issue is much more complicated than most publications suggest: \\"Just as different customers have different needs from your business, different people have different levels of sensitivity with respect to protecting their own privacy\\".     Kasanoff refers to a story that we have all already heard, but this time it has a different ending: \\"We would all like to get back to the old-fashioned service where you return to your local merchant and he remembers that you buy large white eggs and that you like a special kind of fabric. But we wouldn't think so wistfully about this type of relationship if the merchant had run off and shared intimate details of your life with the blacksmith, the saloon owner, and the dressmaker\\".     Here are the four primary INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS OF PERSONALIZATION:  1. SAVE TIME: Eliminate repetitive tasks; remember transactional details; and recognize habits.  2. SAVE MONEY: Prevent redundant work; eliminate service components unnecessary to the person; identify lower cost solutions that meet all other specifications.  3. BETTER INFORMATION: Provide training; filter out information not relevant to a person; provide more specific information that is increasingly relevant to a person's interests; increase the reliability of information; replace \\"average\\" information with information specific to that person's environment.  4. ADDRESS ONGOING NEEDS, CHALLENGES, OR OPPORTUNITIES: Provide one-stop services; allow flexibility in work hours, job responsibilities, and benefits; accommodate unique personal preferences; recognize and reward achievement with special treatment.    Here are 11 WAYS TO MAKE IT PERSONAL, i.e. this is how a firm can deliver the benefits of personalization:  1. COMBINE: Merge information a person already has with that of others, to provide additional insights.  2. COMPARE: Show how prices, quality, or specifications of one option match up to others.  3. CONNECT: In most large firms, data exist in \\"silos\\" or departments. Firms can connect this data, providing a more accurate picture of the firm's interactions with that person. The flip side of this is that connecting previous disparate data removes a level of privacy.  4. EXPLAIN: Clarify how, when, or why to use a product or service, or to perform a task, precisely when a person needs such help.  5. FIND: Locate a person, product, or service based on supplied specifications.  6. MONITOR: Track the status of events, news, or actions of others.  7. RECOMMEND: Suggest a course of action based on historical data, the current environment, or predictive models.  8. REMEMBER: Most people are still more frustrated about what firms forget about them than what they remember. Mantra: \\"Never make a customer tell us the same thing twice\\".  9. REVEAL: Highlight a pattern or conclusion that was not previously evident.  10. SORT: Change the order or grouping of information, making it easier for people to see patterns.  11. TRIGGER: Prompt an action when certain criteria are met, such as the purchase of an item when its price falls below $150.    Finally, Kasanoff suggests that by making two changes in the ways employees are compensated; any company can simultaneously become more profitable and achieve the right balance between privacy and personalization.    Change #1: COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES TO SATISFY MORE NEEDS OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS.  In Kasanoff's experience - and I agree -, most privacy abuses stem from efforts by firms to use personal information to acquire new customers, not to better serve existing customers.    Change #2: DEVELOP MODULAR CAPABILITIES  To make the first change, companies need to accommodate the differences between individuals. Mass customization or Modular capabilities make it profitable for a firm to support personalized relationships. Customization becomes routine and cost-efficient, and in many cases costs will go down, not up. Much of the savings comes from the elimination of waste and the reduction of inventory levels.    Kasanoff was one of the original partners of the Peppers & Rogers Group that coined the term \\"one-to-one\\".    Having May 2004 finalised my Graduate Diploma in E-business with a thesis on Online Personalization, I must say that this book was one of my key sources, especially on the complex issue of balancing Personalization, Privacy and Profit.    If you're really interested in personalization, you may want to read my online review of: \\"The Power of One: Gaining Business Value from Personalization Technologies\\" by Nirmal Pal, Arvind Rangaswamy (2003).    A final quote from the foreword by Peppers & Rogers:  \\"Big brother is almost here. His sister is the telemarketing operator who called you during dinner last night. His nephew runs a sweepstakes and magazine-subscription service just outside of London. The same rapid advances in information technology that are pushing businesses into a new paradigm of competition - the one-to-one marketing paradigm - are simultaneously generating more and more opportunities for the abuse of consumer privacy by mass marketers. Making databases of sensitive, individual consumer information available to marketers interested only in next quarter's sales is like providing chain saws to a tribe of slash-and-burn farmers.\\"    Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2005-03-13

There are very few well-founded books on personalization. This one includes a number of interesting articles on very different angles on personalization (business, technical, privacy, etc.). The first part of the book is on the more strategic issues and the second part on the more operational issues.    STRATEGIC ISSUES  One of the lead chapters is on \\"How to evaluate personalization initiatives\\". The book recommends two dimensions: External Customer Acceptance and Internal Business Value    Two sub-dimensions control External Customer Acceptance:  - The perceived value for customer; i.e. how well is the customer need fulfilled and does it happen timely for the customer.  - Ease of data collection; i.e. how much can be based on the knowledge the business already has - and how much must the customer type manually.    Two sub-dimensions control Internal Business Value:  - Customer's Share of Wallet, i.e. the business' ability to sell more of the same products and/or different products to the customer  - Ease of implementation, i.e. the classic trade-off of production flexibility and production efficiency. How easy is it to customize the offering to the customer and what are the marginal costs in doing this compare to the marginal revenue.    Another interesting chapter is on the evolution of website's personalization. We often talk about personalization as either or. It's too simple. There's a whole spectrum of tools to make a website continually more personalized. The degrees of personalization are from static sites over dynamic sites to global personalized sites.    The book uses the definition from personalization.org:  Personalization is the use of technology and customer information to tailor electronic commerce interactions between a business and each individual customer. Using information either previously obtained or provided in real-time about the customer, the exchange between the parties is altered to fit that customer's stated needs as well as needs perceived by the business based on the available customer information. The purpose of this information technology combined with marketing practices specialized for the World Wide Web is to:   1. Better serve the customer by anticipating needs   2. Make the interaction efficient and satisfying for both parties   3. Build a relationship that encourages the customer to return for subsequent purchases    If you're really interested in personalization, do also consider: Bruce Kasanoff's \\"Making it Personal - How to Profit from Personalization without Invading Privacy\\" (2002).

This pioneering book represents some of his best thoughts on business and corporate strategy.    Chapter 1 is a summary of his first landmark book - \\"Competitive Strategy\\". So if you just want to buy one of his bestsellers, then buy \\"Competitive Advantage\\".    The book's most important contribution is the concept of the VALUE CHAIN. Today, you won't find an MBA who doesn't know this idea. This book gives you all the details on the value chain. And it even tells you exactly how the value chain is translated into his two generic strategies: Cost Leadership and Differentiation. Most strategy books devote a separate chapter to this idea. If you want to get a more than a superficial understanding of the value chain, you simply have to read Porter's book.     This book also gets to the core of how synergies are created and when diversification might work. Curiously, Porter chooses the term interrelationships for synergies (you know, a term for a nice idea that rarely occurred in practice...).    Being a business development manager, I have strategic thinking as part of my key areas. This book is still a reference guide for me. Obviously though, Porter's views cannot stand-alone.     If you're looking for critical views on Porter's ideas, then consider buying Hamel & Prahalad's \\"Competing for the Future\\" (1994) or Kim & Mauborgne's \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" (2005).    Beware: You have to read Porter's Harvard Business review article \\"What is Strategy\\" from 1996, if you want his own response to the critics.      Warning: You cannot work seriously with strategy without having understood Michael Porter's core concepts. And the superficial introduction by most - even advanced - strategy books won't make you competent enough to apply his ideas skilfully. Let me give you two examples:    COST STRUCTURE:   Most MBAs have learned about the value chain and cost structure analysis. But in real life I've seenvery few who combine these two concepts proficiently. The real beauty in benchmarking cost structures is when you skilfully apply it to the value chain. This book tells you exactly how to do this. In practice, I've seen this approach applied very few times (except advanced strategy consultants). It may be because people often use Porter's concepts too casually...    COST DRIVERS:  Most strategy books are on drivers of differentiation - the preferred strategy choice by management gurus. And Porter does indeed help you on this issue. More importantly, this book is one of the few to tell you about the cost drivers. How many books have you read on Cost Leadership? Porter elaborates on 10 cost drivers, such as economies of scale, learning, linkages, synergies, pattern of capacity utilization, integration, timing, policies, and location.    STRATEGY IS ABOUT BEING DIFFERENT. Start out personally by reading the real thing ... it's a bargain.

I believe that Peppers & Rogers' most important contribution is to change a company's focus from customer acquisition to customer retention. That is: Stop spending all your money getting new customers and start spending more on keeping and growing existing customers.    But if you have high expectations - like I had back in 2001 -, then this book on \\"B2B One-to-One\\" will be a huge disappointment. The real good stuff on one-to-one is all found in the first part of the book. But even that is merely a summary of their previously published material.    The case stories - being the bulk of this book - are not very inspiring (except perhaps the inevitable Dell Premier case). I cannot recommend you wasting your time on them. They were already of poor value when published in 2001.    The only real value of \\"B2B One-to-One\\" is provided in few charts as well as a small table on page 64 of the book. Curiously, the authors do not expand on the table's valuable content. If you have read some of the authors' previous publications, you'll already be familiar with their core concept of the IDIC-model (Identify-Differentiate-Interact-Customize):    Phase 1: IDENTIFY  What B2B firms typically do: Identify the most valuable customers by value. Know key contacts in the customer organization.  What B2B firms should do: Map all contacts in the customer organization. Map and remember every contact's influence on the buying process. Create a programme specifically targeting end-users.    Phase 2: DIFFERENTIATE  What B2B firms typically do: Treat different customers differently. Provide superb service levels to the most valuable customers. Differentiate reactively on customers' expressed needs.  What B2B firms should do: Rank customers by lifetime value and strategic value (most growable customers!). Develop strategies for unprofitable customers. Differentiate proactively the handling of different needs-based customer categories.    Phase 3: INTERACT  What B2B firms typically do: Keep interaction only via sales reps. Believe that sales reps will resist change towards sales automation or CRM initiatives because they see them as a threat. Restrict EDI to the largest customers.  What B2B firms should do: Remember interactions with the customer across all interaction points ... including the Internet. Compensate sales reps for reporting details on the customer interaction. Market the Internet as an alternative to EDI.    Phase 4: CUSTOMIZE  What B2B firms typically do: Customize products and services on request from the largest customers on an ad-hoc basis. Develop and execute account plans.  What B2B firms should do: Mass-customize products and services by modularizing the production, delivery, and services processes. Make a template for handling individual customers by using a needs-based segmentation on a routinely basis. Develop and execute specific customer strategies - including strategies for individual contacts within the customer organization.    For the insight provided by this table's content, I rate the book 2 stars.    I recommend that you buy Peppers & Rogers 2004-publication \\"MANAGING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\\" instead. If you read my online review of that book, you'll see why.    Peppers & Rogers' \\"ONE TO ONE FIELDBOOK\\" (1999) is also highly recommended. It's a hands-on book with many checklists and inspiring tools for Monday morning. And it has a dual focus: Both B2C and B2B.

It is written in the dot-com era. And there is indeed a lot of hype on the young start-ups' heroic characteristics such as speed, flexibility, and courage that traditional large companies couldn't compete with in the short run. Today, we all know that these characteristics didn't stand the test of time in a ruthless competitive landscape. <br /> <br />But I'll still recommend this book for a special target audience: People, who are working on an e-business project for a traditional corporation will still get much inspiration from Moss-Kanter's book. Also in retrospect, I find that her best sections in the book were those on describing the tough change management processes that she found in successful \\"old economy\\" firms like Williams-Sonoma, Honeywell, and Reuters. In all these companies, a strong conventional company culture made it extremely difficult for the e-business team to navigate towards success. In 2005, many companies have still not made much of their business model online.  <br /> <br />This is also a very important book for me personally. I read this book on a vacation to Cyprus in May 2001 just before taking on a long 3-year assignment as an e-business manager for a large industrial firm in Denmark. I experienced most of the difficulties that Moss-Kanter describes in her book. <br /> <br />I find the merit of this book in the very colourful case stories of traditional organizations' struggle with e-business initiatives. The author conducted more than 300 interviews of both traditional companies and dotcoms, successes and failures alike, in a research project before writing this book. <br /> <br />As you may know, Harvard professor Moss-Kanter is a leading expert on change management. Her chapter on the \\"change wheel\\" is in a class of its own.  <br /> <br />Peter Leerskov,  <br />MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2005-01-25

You take the first 11 books on the subject and then you write the 12th\\". The Danish Philosopher Soren Kierkegaard said this already 150 years ago. And it's apparently still true.     Only in this case, the authors seem to have gotten their inspiration from one key source ... and that is Harvard professor Michael Watkins, who published \\"THE FIRST 90 DAYS - CRITICAL SUCCESS STRATEGIES FOR NEW LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS\\" in 2003. In that book, Watkins outlines 10 strategies for all leaders about to take up a new leadership position. By the way, Watkins' book is well written without any academic flavour.     What is Neff and Citrin's 8 POINT PLAN? The fundamental idea is: Get set to learn, listen well, set proper expectations, read the culture, build trust, lead by example, set the appropriate direction, and communicate effectively. These ideas are transformed to become the 8 steps for building your foundation towards great performance as a new manager:  1. Prepare Yourself During the Countdown  2. Align Expectations  3. Shape Your Management Team  4. Craft Your Strategic Agenda  5. Start Transforming Culture  6. Manage Your Board/Boss  7. Communicate  8. Avoid Common Pitfalls    If you read my online review of \\"The First 90 Days\\", you'll see that both books focus on exactly the same issues. But Neff and Citrin generously allow 100 days for new managers. Just like Machiavelli suggested for politicians...    I've read this book because I'm very interested in being better at taken on a new leadership position (a situation that I've tried five times in 15 years). Since I enjoyed \\"First 90 Days\\" a lot, I thought this book would add further to my knowledge on the subject. Unfortunately, it didn't. However, I do appreciate the concise 10 guidelines for each of the eight steps. And the appendices also offer practical advice. These contributions earned the two stars rating.    By the way, to complete the \\"cut-and-paste\\" issue, please take a look atGerald M. Czarnecki's book from 2003: \\"You're in charge ... what now? - Seven essential steps for work leader success\\". Same title. Same topic. Only different authors...    Being a reader, I obviously do not care much about who owns the intellectual rights to the ideas. It's just that I do not like to buy a new book on a favourite topic just to learn that I've read all the ideas before in another book on the subject. At least, I would expect an online reviewer to tell me. Well, that's why I wrote this piece...

The authors have published many articles over the last decade on Value Innovation. This is their first book. It summarizes their extensive knowledge on out-of-the-box strategic thinking.    What is a BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY? The authors explain it by comparing it to a red ocean strategy (traditional strategic thinking):   1. DO NOT compete in existing market space. INSTEAD you should create uncontested market space.   2. DO NOT beat the competition. INSTEAD you should make the competition irrelevant.   3. DO NOT exploit existing demand. INSTEAD you should create and capture new demand.   4. DO NOT make the value/cost trade-off. INSTEAD you should break the value/cost trade-off.   5. DO NOT align the whole system of a company's activities with its strategic choice of differentiation or low cost. INSTEAD you should align the whole system of a company's activities in pursuit of both differentiation and low cost.     A red ocean strategy is based on traditional strategic thinking - e.g. Harvard's strategy guru Michael Porter.    Some cases:  * Airline industry price wars result in bankruptcies and low profit margins. Southwest Airlines creates a new market by offering the speed of air travel with the low cost and flexibility of driving.  * Golf equipment industry competes to win a greater share of existing golf customers. Callaway Golf creates \\"Big Bertha\\", a golf club with a large head that attracted new customers to golf that had been frustrated by the difficulty of hitting the ball.  * The cosmetic industry creates a red ocean with models, expensive advertising, and promises of youth and beauty. The Body Shop creates a blue ocean that lasts more than a decade by creating functional cosmetics that defied the industry which sold emotionally appealing cosmetics.  * The wine industry gluts the market with a red ocean of thousands of brands competing on the finest oaks and tannins and legacy winey names. Casella wines creates [yellow tail], a blue ocean wine that succeeded byeliminating complexity, elitism and consumer confusion and creating a fun simple image that non-wine drinkers could enjoy.    A blue ocean is created in the region where a company's actions favourably affect both its cost structure and it value proposition to buyers. Cost savings are made from eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on. Buyer value is lifted by raising and creating elements the industry has never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as scale economies kick in, due to the high sales volumes that superior value generates.     Examples of strategic moves that created blue oceans of new, untapped demand:   - NetJets (fractional Jet ownership)  - Cirque du Soleil (the circus reinvented for the entertainment market)  - Starbucks (coffee as low-cost luxury for high-end consumers)  - Ebay (online auctioning)  - Sony (the Walkman - personal portable stereos)  - Cars: Japanese fuel-efficient autos (mid-70s) and Chrysler minivan (1984)   - Computers: Apple personal computer (1978) and Dell's built-to-order computers (mid-1990s).     The INSEAD professors Kim and Mauborgne have written regularly on the subject of Value Innovation since 1997 in Harvard Business Review. Being a business development manager, their thought leadership on strategic innovation has inspired me tremendously over the years. Their articles have been standard texts for many MBA students for some time (e.g. \\"Value Innovation\\", \\"Creating New Market Space\\", \\"Charting your Company's Future\\"). I expect their first book to be just as dominant in any strategy library as Michael Porter's books (the guru behind the classic red ocean strategies).

At its core, Work-Out is a simple, straightforward concept for cutting out bureaucracy and solving organizational problems - fast. Large groups of employees and managers - from different levels and functions of the organization - come together to address issues that they identify or that senior management has raised as concerns. In small teams, people challenge prevailing assumptions about \\"the way we've always done things\\" and come up with recommendations for dramatic improvements in organizational processes. The Work-Out teams present their recommendations to a senior manager in a \\"town meeting\\", where the manager engages the entire group in a dialogue about the recommendations and then makes yes-or-no decisions on the spot. Recommendations for changing the organization are assigned to \\"owners\\" who have volunteered to carry them out and follow through to get results. That's Work-Out in a nutshell.    Work-Out can be applied to almost any type of problem. It was first used at GE to harvest the low-hanging fruit of OVERGROWN BUREAUCRACY by getting unnecessary and unproductive work out of the organizational system - e.g. reduce meetings, reports, and approval levels. They asked what procedures didn't make sense? Where were they wasting time? What activities seemed to add little value? Some of the bureaucratic procedures were expense reimbursements, making travel arrangements, obtaining office supplies, updating personnel data, taking education courses, upgrading software, and more. But also in the core functions, bureaucracy was found: filling out forms for deals, preparing presentations for approval meetings, keeping track of customer data, obtaining approval for materials purchasing, overwhelming amounts of extra analysis to justify various investments or initiatives. Some of the results were e.g. that expense accounts did not need multiple approvals, people could purchase approved software without going through the IT department, and a pre-deal process was established to see if deals were worth pursuing before going through all the analytics.    Work-Out has been successfully adapted to any type of organization - public or private, commercial or non-profit, large or small. In all of these organizations, no matter what the issue, the process remains much the same.     1. Bring together the people from the organization who know the issues best  2. Challenge them to develop creative solutions  3. Decide on the solutions immediately in a public forum  4. Empower people to carry them out    Despite its massive impact on GE and other firms, Work-Out is not a snake oil or magic elixir. It is a simple set of concepts, tools, and experiences. When stripped to its essence, Work-Out allows people to get some obstacles out of the way so they can do their work better. In many firms, that alone would be a significant gain.    The real merit of this book is the practical approach. If you are - as I am - struggling with the challenges of continually keeping our organizations lean, then this book can help you. It contains many inspiring worksheets, action plans, tools, and hands-on case studies.     The authors of this book helped GE create Work-Out. So don't expect theoretical contributions. Only sound advice.     Co-author Dave Ulrich is one of my favourite HR experts. I can recommend many of his books, e.g. `Results-Based Leadership' and `Delivering Results'. To him, HR is about delivering business performance and organizational capabilities. Cause if you don't, you'll soon be out of business. The tricky part is balancing the soft and hard part of HR. Dave Ulrich has many good concepts to make that happen. This book is not a bad place to start, if you'd like to pick his brains...

It's also for you and me. It's for functional managers, project managers, and supervisors. The book targets new leaders at all levels that are making the transition from one rung of the ladder to the next.    If you have just been promoted to a new leadership position (or expect to be soon), then this book is for you.     The book outlines ten strategies that will shorten the time it takes you to reach what Watkins calls the breakeven point: the point at which your organization needs you as much as you need the job. Here they are ... the ten strategies:    1. PROMOTE YOURSELF. Make a mental break from your old job. Prepare to take charge in the new one. Don't assume that what has made you successful so far will continue to do so. The dangers of sticking with what you know, working hard at doing it, and failing miserably are very real.    2. ACCELERATE YOUR LEARNING. Climb the learning curve as fast as you can in your new organization. Understand markets, products, technologies, systems, and structures, as well as its culture and politics. It feels like drinking from a fire hose. So you have to be systematic and focused about deciding what you need to learn.     3. MATCH STRATEGY TO SITUATION. There are no universal rules for success in transitions. You need to diagnose the business situation accurately and clarify its challenges and opportunities. The author identifies four very different situations: launching a start-up, leading a turnaround, devising a realignment, and sustaining a high-performing unit. You need to know what your unique situation looks like before you develop your action plan.    4. SECURE EARLY WINS. Early victories build your credibility and create momentum. They create virtuous cycles that leverage organizational energy. In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results.     5. NEGOTIATE SUCCESS. You need to figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss and manage his or her expectations. No other relationship is more important. This means having a series of critical talks about the situation, expectations, style, resources, and your personal development. Crucially, it means developing and gaining consensus on your 90-day plan.    6. ACHIEVE ALIGNMENT. The higher you rise in an organization, the more you have to play the role of organizational architect. This means figuring out whether the organization's strategy is sound, bringing its structure into alignment with its strategy, and developing the systems and skills bases necessary to realize strategic intent.    7. BUILD YOUR TEAM. If you are inheriting a team, you will need to evaluate its members. Perhaps you need to restructure it to better meet demands of the situation. Your willingness to make tough early personnel calls and your capacity to select the right people for the right positions are among the most important drivers of success during your transition.     8. CREATE COALITIONS. Your success will depend on your ability to influence people outside your direct line of control. Supportive alliances, both internal and external, will be necessary to achieve your goals.      9. KEEP YOUR BALANCE. The risks of losing perspective, getting isolated, and making bad calls are ever present during transitions. The right advice-and-counsel network is an indispensable resource    10. EXPEDITE EVERYONE. Finally, you need to help everyone else - direct reports, bosses, and peers - accelerate their own transitions. The quicker you can get your new direct reports up to speed, the more you will help your own performance.    This book is not only relevant on the individual level. This transition process for new managers happens so often that it should be handled with more professionalism by (big) organizations. Whereas we as managers try to workactively with introduction programmes and training for new employees, then many managers must face their transition challenge alone. It shouldn't be like that. The \\"sink or swim\\" approach should be doomed.    Peter Leerskov,   M.Sc. in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2004-12-20

The basic idea in this excellent strategy book is as follows:    STRATEGIC POSITIONING is simply the sum of a company's answers to three questions:     &#62; WHO should I target as customers?   &#62; WHAT products or services should I offer them?   &#62; HOW can I best deliver these products and services to these customers?    Strategy is all about making tough choices in these three dimensions (who, what, and how). Remember that deciding what NOT to do is just as important as deciding what to do...    The next issue is then to construct the appropriate organizational environment that will support the choices made. Also in this area, Markides contributes with a refreshingly clear and practical approach.    Markides argues that even the best of strategies will only have a limited life. Thus, companies must continually evaluate their performance and position in order to be able to quickly create and colonize new strategic positions. Strategy is a dynamic concept - not static. A very practical approach to innovate strategic thinking is to keep starting the process at different points: who/what/how, who/how/what, what/who/how, what/how/who, how/what/who, how/what/who, and finally how/who/what.    Thus, The marketing philosophy always starts externally at the customer (who?) and works backwards towards solutions (what?), and finally adapts the firm's delivery system (how?). But a strong trend during the last decade has been on the internal perspective on core competences, such as procurement or production. This method means that we start with own unique capabilities in the delivery system (how?), which then is translated into solutions (what?) and finally customers (who?). Radical innovation often is created this way, e.g. the &#34;walkman&#34;. In practice of business development, we usually have to work in both directions.     This book is not a dry academic's dusty words. Markides uses a wealth of case stories onstrategic positions. Being a Dane, I find it very nice indeed that the companies cited often are of European origin.    Nirmalya Kumar's brilliant book &#34;Marketing as Strategy&#34; (2004) expands on Markides' ideas in this book. They both are indebted to professor Derek Abell for the original concept presented in the landmark strategy book: &#34;Defining the business&#34; (1980).

He has shown THOUGHT LEADERSHIP on strategy in books like Defining the Business (1980) and Strategic Market Planning (1979).     This book summarizes Abell's complete experience on strategic planning. And I promise you; he has a lot to offer!    This fall of 2004, a leading Danish business school still used this book as curricula for their MBA-level course on business development. I have many newer strategy books on my bookshelf, but I agree fully with their choice.    Abell's core idea is that TO SUSTAIN EXCELLENCE, COMPANIES NEED DUAL STRATEGIES - ONE FOR THE PRESENT AND ONE FOR THE FUTURE.    The distinction between a PRESENT (\\"today for today\\") and FUTURE (\\"today for tomorrow\\") orientation is not the usual short-term, long-term distinction - in which the short-term plan is simply a detailed operations and budgeting exercise made in the context of a hoped-for long-term market position. Present planning also requires strategy - a vision of how the firm has to operate now (given its competencies and target markets) and what the role of each key function will be. The long-term plan, by contrast, is built on a vision of the future - even more important, on a strategy for getting there.    Planning for today requires a clear, precise definition of the business - a delineation of target customer segments, customer functions, and the business approach to be taken; planning for tomorrow is concerned with how the business should be redefined for the future.     Planning for today focuses on shaping up the business to meet the needs of today's customers with excellence. It involves identifying factors that are critical to success and smothering them with attention; planning for tomorrow can entail reshaping the business to compete more effectively in the future.     Planning for today seeks to achieve compliance in the firm's functional activities with whatever definition of the business has been chosen; planning for tomorrow often involves bold moves away from existing ways of conducting the business.     Planning for today requires an organization that mirrors current business opportunities; planning for tomorrow may require reorganization for future challenges.     IN SHORT, PLANNING FOR TODAY IS ABOUT MANAGING CURRENT ACTIVITIES WITH EXCELLENCE; PLANNING FOR TOMORROW IS ABOUT MANAGING CHANGE.     I've read this book three times since it was published (okay, I may be somewhat slow). And each time, I add to my knowledge on working with strategy. Having worked very much with strategic management in practice over the last 15 years, I find it amazing that I cannot make more people read this book. But I won't give up. If you don't have time to read the full book, then consider reading Abell's article on the same subject in Sloan Management Review, spring 1999. However, the article doesn't include much on Abell's heavy toolbox presented in the book.

Kaplan & Norton's focus on creating easy-to-understand frameworks for implementing strategy is admirable. They have published their ideas in articles and books over they last 10 years. This book - Strategy Maps - is the third book in their campaign for making strategy happen.    The first book from 1996 introduced the BALANCED SCORECARD (BSC). A tool that translates an organization's mission and strategy into a comprehensive set of performance measures that provides the framework for a strategic measurement and management system. The performance measures were arranged into four PERSPECTIVES. Viewed horizontally, like in a grid, each perspective represents the set of objectives desired by a particular stakeholder (Financial, Customer, Internal Process/Organization, Learning & Growth/Employees). The perspectives, when taken together, permit a complete view of the strategy and \\"tell the story of a strategy\\" in a clearly understandable framework.    In 2001, the second book introduced the STRATEGY-FOCUSED ORGANIZATION that places strategy at the centre of its management processes - not only for measurement purposes. Strategy is now central to the firm's agenda. There are five principles to a Strategy-Focused Organization: Mobilize Change through Executive Leadership; Translate the Strategy to Operational Terms [that is, balanced scorecard and strategy map]; Align the Organization to the Strategy; Make Strategy Everyone's Job; Make Strategy a Continual Process.    Finally in 2004, this book expands the concept of the STRATEGY MAP, which is a visual representation of an organization's strategy and the processes and systems necessary to implement that strategy. A strategy map is basically a one-page graphical summary, showing employees how their jobs are linked to the organization'soverall objectives.    This book adds some new contributions to the concept of strategy maps:    TEMPLATES. The main benefit of this book may be the (very) many templates that should stimulate most readers to build their own customised strategy map. Being a relatively experienced balanced scorecard practitioner myself, I certainly enjoyed the inspiration from the templates. Most benefit is derived from the templates that describe the basic components of how value gets created in the internal process perspective as well as the learning and growth perspective. I can highly recommend the strategy map templates reflecting the firm's generic competitive strategy - lowest-cost vs. product leader vs. customer intimacy.    STRATEGIC THEMES, which are based on a few selected key value-creating processes. The authors introduce a taxonomy that classifies internal value-creating processes into four clusters that each may have literally hundreds of sub-processes that create value in some way:   - operations management (i.e. producing and delivering. Also known as supply chain management)  - customer management (or CRM)  - innovation of products and processes (such as Product-Lifecycle Management etc.)  - regulatory and social: conforming to regulations and societal expectations    INTANGIBLE ASSETS FRAMEWORK, which attempts to describe, measure, and align the three intangible assets in the learning and growth perspective to the strategic processes and objectives in the internal perspectives. The three types of intangible assets are:  - Human capital: employees' skills, talent, and knowledge.   - Organization capital: culture, leadership, employee alignment, teamwork, and knowledge management   - Information capital: Databases, information systems, network, and technology infrastructure    I have worked in practice with the balanced scorecard since 1998. This book is a natural follow-up to the authors' previous work. I fully acknowledge the critical issues mentioned by some of the reviewers. So if you don't want to work with balanced scorecard, let this book go.    But if you are already working within this strategy framework in your organization, you really shouldn't miss this book. It expands on many of the interesting ideas that you probably already know. It also brings you up to date with their current thinking. That's why I rate it four stars.

But how can an organisation adopt great ideas, tools, and methods, absorbing them in a way to stimulate change and get superior results? <br /> <br />Harvard-professor John P. Kotter has been observing this process for almost 30 years. What intrigues him is why some leaders are able to take these tools and methods and get their organizations to change dramatically - while most do not. <br /> <br />How many times have we not seen somebody get very excited about some new tool (CRM, e-business, etc.)? Yet two years later there is no performance improvement at all. Often because most of the organisation has rejected the change needed to make it happen. <br /> <br />When people need to make big changes significantly and effectively, Kotter finds that there are generally eight basic things that must happen: <br /> <br />1. INSTILL A SENSE OF URGENCY. Identifying existing or potential crises or opportunities. Confronting reality, in the words of Execution-authors, Charan and Bossidy. <br /> <br />2. PICK A GOOD TEAM. Assembling a strong guiding coalition with enough power to lead the change effort. And make them work as a team, not a committee! <br /> <br />3. CREATE A VISION AND SUPPORTING STRATEGIES. We need a clear sense of purpose and direction. In less successful situations you generally find plans and budgets, but no vision and strategy; or the strategies are so superficial that they have no credibility. <br /> <br />4. COMMUNICATE. As many people as possible need to hear the mandate for change loud and clear, with messages sent out consistently and often. Forget the boring memos that nobody reads! Try using videos, speeches, kick-off meetings, workshops in small units, etc. Also important is the teaching of new behaviours by the example of the guiding coalition  <br /> <br />5. REMOVE OBSTACLES. Get rid of anything blocking change, like bosses stuck in the old ways or lack of information systems. Encourage risk-taking andnon-traditional ideas, activities, and actions. Empowerment is moving obstacles out of peoples' way so they can make something happen, once they've got the vision clear in their heads. <br /> <br />6. CHANGE FAST. Little quick wins are essential for creating momentum and providing sufficient credibility to pat the hard-working people on the back and to diffuse the cynics. Remember to recognize and reward employees involved in the improvements. <br /> <br />7. KEEP ON CHANGING. After change organizations get rolling and have some wins, they don't stop there. They go back and make wave after wave of other actions necessary for long-term, significant change. Successful change leaders don't drop the sense of urgency. On top of that, they are very systematic about figuring out all of the pieces they need to have in place before they declare victory. <br />  <br />8. MAKE CHANGE STICK. The last big step is nailing big change to the floor and making sure it sticks. And the way things stick is through culture. If you can create a totally new culture around some new way of managing, it will stay. It won't live on if it is dependent on one boss or a couple of enthusiastic people who will eventually move on. <br /> <br />We can divide these eight steps in three main processes. The first four steps focus on de-freezing the organization. The next three steps make change happen. The last step re-freezes the organization on the next rung on the ladder. <br /> <br />I've personally used Kotter's change process in several e-business projects. It has helped me a lot. I highly recommend that you buy this easy-to-read and affordable book. Alternatively, read his Harvard Business Review article from Mar/Apr 1995 on the same subject. <br /> <br />Peter Leerskov,  <br />MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2004-11-20

We are witness to dictatorial executives, antiquated decision processes, incompetent amateurs, and sometimes even corrupt lawbreakers.    Often the focus is on the catastrophic mistakes in management, auditing, and/or disclosures. But the sad truth is that many of these mistakes could have been found and fixed in the boards. The board's role is to supervise and govern. If the board does not have the resources themselves, they must make sure that an impartial third-party service provider does it.     This book explores why corporate boards fail and also give ideas on how to fix them. The author reveals ten specific failings of the typical boardroom model and proven advice to get boards back on track. Some of the boardroom ills he diagnoses include:    WEAK BOARD LEADERSHIP  Problem: The board oversees (at the same time it is led by) the CEO. Too many boards accept that the CEO runs the board meetings - without being sufficiently challenged by the chairman or the others. In Europe, we divide the roles of the chairman and the CEO. But that doesn't mean that we don't have our share of scandals, since a strong CEO also can dictate solutions in practice by forcing rubberstamp decision processes in the boardroom  Solution: Make some of the board meetings (or part of them) without the executive officers. Keep the meeting's chairman role and the CEO role separate.    POOR DATA (and even worse delivery).   Problem: Some boards receive too little or too much information - or just plain bad information.  Solution: Too much data: Require a one-page-summary from the CEO summarizing the top three to five issues of the information pack. Too little data: Require more and better information before a decision is made.    INCOMPETENT BOARD MEMBERS  Problem: Inadequate time, resources, and expertise for the job.  Solution: Better board member recruiting process as well as annual performance evaluation of individual board members.    DIRECTOR ISOLATION: Don't-ask-don't-tell model.   Problem: Outside board members are often amazingly out of touch with the staff, shareholders, and the firm for which they bear ultimate legal responsibility. This is a key weakness.   Solution: Professional directors build their own informal networks with e.g. finance, investor relations, sales, marketing, production, or research. If the director then also talks to a few of the firm's external stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, and suppliers, then it will provide an even stronger background to base any board decisions.  I have personally experienced board members who on their own have spent full days visiting head offices and production facilities and included individual talks with non-executive managers. It's very inspiring for the managers. It also gives the board member a much better feel for the views and competences of the broader management team.     Management in corporations has over the last 50 years become more professional and universal due to formal education. However, governance of the same corporations is still stuck at the level of anecdotes and myths. This book helps to unveil many of the important issues of making corporate governance work in practice.     Ralph Ward is the author of several fine books on improving corporate boards and publishes an online newsletter. You may want to check his (unsophisticated) website on [...]    One of the best things of this book may be that Ward is letting many experienced board members comment on the issues and provide their advice for the reader. It makes the book much more extensive in scope and exciting to read.    Having just started on being a board member myself, I already recognise many of the issues that this book raises. Having spent 15 years in businesses on preparing board material, I unfortunately also feel guilty of some of his very relevant points on (too much) information.

The authors manage to take Michael Porter's two generic competitive strategies - Differentiation and Cost Leader - and elaborate on these to an extent never presented so elegantly before. In the process, they discover a third generic strategy - Customer Intimacy.    Thus, Treacy and Wiersema distinguish between focusing on the following value dimensions:  - Operational excellence (cost leadership / focus on supply chain management)  - Product leadership (innovation / focus on product lifecycle management)  - Customer Intimacy (service leadership /focus on customer relationship management)     These are the FOUR RULES that govern market leaders' actions:  Rule 1: Provide the best offering in the marketplace by excelling in a specific dimension of value  Rule 2: Maintain threshold standards on the other dimensions of value  Rule 3: Dominate your market by improving value year after year  Rule 4: Build a well-tuned operating model dedicated to delivering unmatched value    Expanding on the fourth rule - operating models - may the best long-term contribution of this book. The authors explain in detail and via case stories how the operating models differ for each of the three value propositions. In practice, I've learned that by explaining the operating models, many people can easier find themselves depicted than in the overall generic dimensions of cost, service or product leadership.    OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE or Cost Leadership - Best total cost - operating model:  Key success factor: Formula!   Golden rule: Variety kills efficiency  Culture: Disciplined teamwork; Process focused; Conformance, \\"one size fits all\\" mindset  Organization: Centralized functions; high skills at the core of the organization  Core processes: Product delivery and basic service cycle;built on standard, no frills fixed assets  Management Systems: Command and control; Compensation fixed to cost and quality; transaction profitability tracking  Information Technology: Integrated, low-cost transaction systems; Mobile and remote technologies    PRODUCT LEADERSHIP - Best product - operating model:  Key success factor: Talent!   Golden rule: Cannibalize your success with breakthroughs  Culture: Concept, future driven; Experimentation, \\"out of the box\\" mindset; Attack, go for it, win  Organization: Ad-hoc, organic, and cellular; High skills abound in loose-knit structures  Core processes: Invention, Commercialisation; Market exploitation; Disjoint work procedures  Management Systems: Decisive, risk oriented; Reward individuals' innovation capacity; Product lifecycle profitability  Information Technology: Person-to-person communications systems; Technologies enabling cooperation and knowledge management    CUSTOMER INTIMACY - Best total solution - operating model:  Key success factor: Solution!   Golden rule: Solve the client's broader problem  Culture: Client and filed driven; Variation: \\"Have it your way\\" mindset  Organization: Entrepreneurial client teams; High skills in the field  Core processes: Client acquisition and development; Solution development; Flexible and responsive work procedures  Management Systems: Revenue and share-of-wallet driven; Rewards based in part on client feedback; Lifetime value of client   Information Technology: Customer databases linking internal and external information; Knowledge bases built around expertise    If you're interested in Customer Intimacy, you may want to add Wiersema's additional book on only this strategy to your shopping basket. I highly recommend both paperback books ... great value for money ;-)    Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2004-11-17

Unfortunately, the good things aren't new, and the new things aren't good.    I have reviewed Charan and Bossidy's book on EXECUTION as well as Charan's book on PROFITABLE GROWTH. Both were great readings that asked us to confront reality in order to do what matters to get things right.    I've just read CONFRONTING REALITY. And I cannot help asking myself, why it was published at all? It doesn't add any new material compared to their marvellous bestseller; Execution. Instead this book spends most of its time telling case stories on the subject. I find too many of them too long and too boring.    The authors' new focus on the vague concept of the business model is still a mystery to me. Why not build on strong concepts such as McKinsey's business system or Porter's value chain with proven track records. Please, confront reality!    My advice is that you buy Execution instead. It's much better. It has a clear concept, a stronger structure - and exactly the same highly important messages.     If you're a hardcore fan - like I am - of Charan and Bossidy's execution concept, you may just want to have this as an audio book for a long highway trip... that's how I managed to get through it.

Reengineering was a revolutionary \\"big idea\\" that took businesses with storm in the early 1990s. A decade after his first publications, Hammer's book, \\"The Agenda\\", acknowledge that reengineering is no \\"silver bullet\\" ... it cannot stand alone. Modern management needs to use several business concepts simultaneously to thrive in the new customer economy, i.e. where supply exceeds demand (overcapacity), customers are sophisticated and informed buyers, and many products are becoming commoditised. With long-term trends like globalization and technology, there's no foreseeable end to the customer power that flows from it. So we better be prepared.    The nine building blocks of Hammer's \\"Agenda\\" address the ways in which firms are managed, organized, and operated:     1. MAKE YOURSELF EASY TO DO BUSINESS WITH (ETDBW). Take a long hard look at yourself ... from your customers' point of view...!, and then redesign how to work to save them time, money, and frustration.     2. ADD MORE VALUE FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS (MVA). To avoid the trap of commoditization, in which you fight for a minuscule margin against a horde of look-alike, you need to do more for your customers.     3. OBSESS ABOUT YOUR PROCESSES. Customers care only about results, and results come only from end-to-end processes. Manage them, improve them, appoint owners for them, and make everyone aware of them.     4. TURN CREATIVE WORK INTO PROCESS WORK. Innovation doesn't have to be chaotic. Bring the power of discipline and structure to sales, product development, and other creative work. Make success in these areas the result of design and management, not luck...     5. USE MEASUREMENT FOR IMPROVING, NOT ACCOUNTING. Most of your measurements are worthless; they tell you what has happened (sort of) but give you no clue as to what to do for the future. Create a model of your business that ties overall goals tothings you control; measure the items that really make a difference; and embed measurement in a serious program of managed improvement.     6. LOOSEN UP YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. The days of the proudly independent manager running a sharply defined unit are over. Collaboration and teamwork are now as necessary in the executive suite as on the front lines. Teach your managers how to work together for the good of the enterprise rather than the stab each other in the back for narrow gain.     7. SELL THROUGH, NOT TO, YOUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. Don't let your distribution channels blind you to your final customer, the one who pays everyone's salaries. Change distribution from a series of resellers into a community that works together to serve that final customer. Be ready to redefine the roles of everyone involved in order to achieve that end.     8. PUSH PAST YOUR BOUNDARIES IN PURSUIT OF EFFICIENCY. The last vestiges of overhead lurk, not deep in your company, but at its edges. Exploit the real power of the Internet to streamline the processes that connect you with customers and suppliers. Collaborate with everyone you can to drive out cost and overhead.     9. LOSE YOUR IDENTITY IN AN EXTENDED ENTERPRISE. Get past the idea of being a self-contained company that delivers a complete product. Get used to the notion that you can achieve something only when you virtually integrate with others. Focus on what you do best, get rid of the rest, and encourage others to do the same.    The first two agenda elements are concerned with customer management (ETDBW and MVA)- i.e. how to distinguish firms from look-alike rivals and how to create loyal customers. The third and fourth are about business processes - Hammer's old theme of reengineering. The fifth is about measurement systems and the sixth about the teamplayer role of the manager. The last three are about using modern technology such as the Internet to create value by linking firms with one another - instead of trying to optimize only within own your company's legal boundaries.    Hammer is concentrating on HOW not what. If you're focused on executing, then I think you'll like Hammer's agenda.

His writing is very much down-to-earth, no-nonsense, and straightforward. So when he says 10 tools for Monday morning, believe him! Here they are:    1. MAKE REVENUE GROWTH EVERYONE'S BUSINESS. Just like a cost reduction agenda may be a permanent theme in daily conversations and meetings in all departments, so should revenue growth be. And it's not just for the management, it's for all employees to think in this direction (just like we try with the cost reduction agenda).    2. HIT MANY SINGLES AND DOUBLES, NOT JUST HOME RUNS. While home runs provide the opportunity for a quantum leap, they are unpredictable and don't happen all the time. Singles and doubles, however, can happen every day of the year. This piece of advice may sound somewhat trivial. But for what it's worth, my experience from especially larger firms is that it may turn out to be the most important tool. Many big corporations tend to devote too much thinking into finding the big home run - and may give too little attention to the many small growth areas that short-term perhaps do not make an important contribution, but often keep the organization full of life and energy - and well-prepared for take-off...if the elusive home run should materialise.    3. SEEK GOOD GROWTH AND AVOID BAD GROWTH. Good growth not only increases revenues but improves profits, is sustainable over time, and does not use unacceptable levels of capital. It is also primarily organic (internally generated) and based on differentiated products and services that fill new or unmet needs, creating value for customers. Charan constantly challenges leaders that seek acquisitions as primary driver for revenue growth ... instead of organic growth.    4. DISPEL THE MYTHS THAT INHIBIT BOTH PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS FROM GROWING. Confront excuses such as: \\"We are in a no-growth industry, and no one is growing\\"; \\"Customers are buying only on price\\"; or \\"The distributors arethe ones in direct contact with retailers, and there's not much I can do.\\"     5. TURN THE IDEA OF PRODUCTIVITY ON ITS HEAD BY INCREASING REVENUE PRODUCTIVITY. The old saw says, \\"We have to do more with less.\\" The problem, though, is that the focus is usually on the \\"less\\" and the \\"more\\" rarely happens. Revenue productivity is a tool for getting that elusive \\"more\\" by actively and creatively searching for ideas for revenue growth without using a disproportionate amount of resources.     6. DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A GROWTH BUDGET. All companies have a budget. It is, however, astonishing how little detail about revenue and sources of revenue growth you can find there. Almost all of the lines in the budget are cost-related. Few, if any, identify resources explicitly earmarked for growth. The growth budget provides a foundation that will allow a company to increase revenues instead of just talking about it.     7. BEEF UP STRATEGIC MARKETING. One of the key missing links for generating revenue growth at most firms is strategic marketing. Most people visualize marketing as tactical tools such as advertising, promotion, and brand-building. Strategic marketing, on the other hand, takes place at a much earlier stage by identifying and precisely defining which customer segments to focus on. It analyzes how the end-user uses the product or service and what competitive advantage will be required to win the customer and at what price points. Charan is using the term \\"upstream marketing\\". But I find it a weird way of describing strategic marketing. So I changed it.    8. UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO EFFECTIVE CROSS-SELLING (or value/solutions selling). Cross-selling can be a significant source of revenue growth, but most companies approach it from exactly the wrong perspective. They start by saying, \\"What else can we sell to our existing customer base?\\" Instead of looking inside-out your organization, you need to look outside-in. Successful cross-selling starts by selecting a segment ofcustomers and then working backward to define precisely the mix of products and services they need and creatively shaping a value proposition unique to them.     9. CREATE A SOCIAL ENGINE TO ACCELERATE REVENUE GROWTH. Every organization is a social system, the center of which is a way of thinking and acting that sets both day-to-day actions and the long-term agenda. When an organization has an explicit growth agenda understood by everyone, growth becomes a central focus--a social engine--during formal meetings as well as informal discussions. This tool is closely linked to tool no. 1.    10. OPERATIONALIZE INNOVATION BY CONVERTING IDEAS INTO REVENUE GROWTH. Innovation is not the private property of lone geniuses working apart from the mainstream of the business. In any company of reasonable size, innovation is a social process that requires collaboration and communication for idea generation, selecting those ideas for revenue growth that are to be funded, and shaping those ideas into product prototypes and launching them into the marketplace.     Those were the 10 tools. I find the conclusion to be that revenue growth must supplement a cost reduction agenda (though you may want to wait 6-9 months after the efficiency programme have been initiated before embarking on the growth theme). Too many firms focus narrowly on cost cuttings, but to survive long-term we need to have the growth engine to be running as well (singles and doubles are just fine!).

US	32525887	RPMUZHP6ACKQI	0954282973	629738361	Bare Essentials: The ALDI Way of Retailing	Books	5	32	32	N	N	Less is more: the ascetic culture of a low-cost retail giant	This book is the untold inside story from a former executive of German retail discount giant Aldi. Some of the advices that I recall from the German edition are the following (they are all interrelated):    ASCETICISM AS A BASIC PRINCIPLE. This word is usually connected to people avoiding physical pleasures and comforts, esp. for religious reasons (e.g. monks). In this context, it's more focused on what you can do without: headquarters, external market study, management consultants, and highly complex information technology. Instead Aldi focuses on a simple price strategy (everyday-low-price), undifferentiated product assortment, and avoid luxury.    THRIFTINESS AS A GUIDING PRINCIPLE. Everybody's talking about cost consciousness, but at Aldi this is second nature. There's a continuous avoidance of unnecessary costs on all levels.    INTERNAL RECRUITING OF HIGH-LEVEL MANAGERS. This principle is also recognised in bestseller \\"Good to Great\\". It's also a strong signal to internal candidates that they can expect to be next in line ... so be patient, you're time will come. The principle makes sure that top-managers fit the company culture. The negative effect is that you occasionally will be lacking the fresh eyes from outside.    LIVE THE DECENTRALISED ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE. Aldi believes that the most efficient enterprise exists, when the overall direction set by the central unit is clear and remainder of the decisions are left to the decentralized organization - closer to where the action is.    MAKE A VIRTUE OF A NECESSITY. Many firms focus on doing some things unusually well. That's not necessary. The best service is often just doing the obvious and necessary tasks in a simple way.    CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS. Instead of believing in huge cost cutting exercises or grandiose concepts like business process reengineering, Aldi believes in all employees' ideas to reducing costs. They are close to day-to-day work and can best evaluate what needs to be done to continually make things simpler and less expensive. This idea is closer to the [Japanese] quality concept of continuous improvement (evolution) than any [American] management fads on cost reduction based on organizational revolutions or merger-mania.    STICK TO YOUR KNITTING. Do only what you can do really well. Retailers are to trade with consumers; producers are to produce. Don't diversify, stick to the core business. Concentration is important for efficiency.     NO PUBLIC APPEARANCES. The attitude is that the public information is useful only to the competition. The managers' self-manifestation won't bring any competitive advantage for Aldi. This principle probably only works, since it's a private company. In the brave new world of war for talent and capital, this attitude probably will have to be adjusted.    SIMPLICITY IN PRACTICE. Avoid strong central staff and a big headquarters. The practice in the line of business is much more important than any theoretical staff work. Line managers do all special tasks. Focus on lean organizational hierarchies, clear decision authority, clear targets, and simple execution.    If you want to understand some of these productivity principles by low-cost companies better, let me recommend that you also check out \\"Less is more\\" by Jason Jennings. The companies cited in that book are Ikea, Ryanair, The Warehouse, Nucor, etc.    Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2004-10-12

This book provides a brilliant insight into the real world of a successful loyalty programme at Tesco. It is a success story told by insiders (primarily the subcontractors).    The focus is on the Clubcard, but it also contains an interesting chapter on their online shopping success that is created on the basis of many of the same competences that the loyalty card required.     I'd like to put the book into perspective by playing devil's advocate. So what's the downside of a loyalty programme? Three problems usually hinder the success: big investment, internal culture clash, and privacy issues.    1) BIG INVESTMENT. It's expensive to develop the database - and even more expensive to maintain it. Especially the latter point is usually forgotten, while most people haven't yet tried to sustain a loyalty programme. The fact is namely that it eventually always risk running out of steam after the first breathtaking love affair for both the customer and the company.   \\"Scoring points\\" has devoted some attention to the development phase, where the Clubcard was \\"skunk work\\" without much prestige in the big British retail operation. But I like the second part of maintaining the magic of the relationship even better (because this story is so rarely told). They explain how to keep the loyalty programme alive and kicking for the customers by micro-segmentation, adding financial services, creating multi-channel retailing including the web, and so on to keep the concept fresh. The book also spends a lot of time explaining how the customer data can be used to see trends and also get new understanding of the customers' behaviours that we haven't been able to before.     2) INTERNAL CULTURE CLASH. It's not easy to get everyone in the firm to be oriented towards relationship marketing and make use of the available information. Transaction marketing is usually much easier and less demandingof the organization than real relationship building. \\"Scoring points\\" also covers these issues where the competition for resources from the top management is one issue and the relationship to the shop managers and shop assistants is another area. And it doesn't happen overnight - it usually takes several years with constant focus and commitment. The programme had testing phases, and needed many quick wins in several stores to obtain interest from other shop managers. Tesco's lesson in taking the time to make relationship marketing a part of an organization's culture is very valuable - and replicates my experience from other industries.    3) PRIVACY ISSUES. Maybe your customers don't want close relationships. Perhaps your customers even resent knowing that you have collected too much information about them.   In \\"Scoring points\\", they tell a story of a wife that complained about condoms that suddenly appeared on her personalized online shopping list, since her husband didn't use them. It turned out that he actually did, but not at home. His fault was that he bought the condoms in a Tesco shop with his loyalty card that was integrated to the web solution. That's how it was shown to his online-shopping wife. So much for privacy... That's an extreme - though real - example. And it's very illuminating for the sensitivity of data that we're dealing with - even when we think we're only selling groceries.    Tesco's story should be required reading for everybody that would like to understand a long-term relationship marketing concept in depth. I find that the real strength of the book is the chapters on how to preserve the programme. This story is often untold.

He reports that only 25 to 30 percent of companies implementing CRM initiatives feel that they are getting the return they expected.    He also manages to put forward many of the real causes for CRM projects failures. Most prominently that CRM projects are more concerned about internal efficiency in handling customers (automation of sales force, marketing, and customer service) than the real needs of the customer. So at the end of the day, the firm might have saved some dollars in internal processes and manpower, but the customers are probably treated even worse than before.     This quote from the book illustrates the point:  \\"Marketing automation is fine, but it's not about the customer. Most marketing automation is about costs and speed. Selling efficiency is not about the customer, it's just about leveraging your resources. Value maximization, in terms of figuring out which of your customer segments are going to deliver the most top or bottom line, that's not about the customer. So a lot of the benefits that are claimed for CRM are really benefits that accrue to the enterprise, but have nothing to do with the customer\\"    That's why Newell calls for a change. Instead of CRM, we should put the customer in charge instead and call it CMR. That is Customer-Managed Relationships. It's a good and a valid point.    Newell summarizes the journey from CRM to CMR like this:  * From the company is in control ... to the customer is in control  * From make business better for the company ... to make business better for the customer  * From track customers by transaction ... to understand customer's unique needs  * From treat customers as segments ... to treat customers as individuals  * From force customers to do what you believe they'll want ... to let customers tell you what they care about  * From customers feel stalked ... to customers feel empowered  * From organized around products and services ... to organized around customers    The reason why I rate the book somewhat low is that it is poorly structured with endless anecdotes scattered all over the book.    If you're interested in CRM, then take a look at the new bible: \\"Managing Customer Relationships: A Strategic Framework\\" by Don Peppers, Martha Rogers. It is highly recommended ;-)      Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2004-10-01
US	32525887	R1CRWM3ZJM1UGV	1591392101	584009656	Marketing As Strategy: Understanding the CEO's Agenda for Driving Growth and Innovation	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Marketing function: From the existing crisis to a new role	It is ironic that while still more firms increasingly talk about customer-focus and CRM, the marketing function is losing ground to other functions in the firm when it comes to driving broad organizational initiatives to create value for the customer.    One example is projects to obtain better handling of customer relations (CRM) that focus on coordinating everything that a firm does towards customers. The CRM philosophy in its nature transcends the traditional functional silos. As a minimum, it requires that sales, customer service, call centre, shipping, finance, and obviously marketing will have to cooperate to create the best total experience for the customer.    COMPANY-WIDE PERSPECTIVE  It demands a mindset that is strategic, company-wide and focused on the bottom-line. And it requires the participants' desire and capability to work with advanced IT systems. If marketing is to lead these extensive projects, it simply isn't enough to be a specialist in tactical issues, such as market research, creative ad campaigns, printed sales brochures, media plans, or web content management.    But the future for marketing is still bright, though. At least, this is the opinion of professor Kumar who now teaches at the London Business School - following eight years as marketing professor at the Swiss IMD MBA-school. His book is in reality a defence for marketing and targeted at the top management.    In the new future role, marketing leaders need to help the firm implement organizational change with a focus of creating value to the customer. This has always been the core theme of marketing. But to make a difference, marketing people need increasingly to:  &#62; Focus less on own functional silo and more on broad and multi-disciplinary activities across the firm  &#62; Focus less on short-term tactics and more on long-term, overall strategy  &#62; Focus less on getting increasing marketing budgets and more on the firm's bottom-line    WHO-WHAT-HOW  The book manages to create a number of interesting ideas to increase the status of marketing. Central in Kumar's work is the 3V-model that covers the following terms: Valued Customer (who?), Value Proposition (what?), and Value Network (how?).    Kumar shows with a lot of illustrative graphics, interesting checklists, and well-described cases from the real world - e.g. EasyJet -, how his ideas can be converted into practice.    Instead of the 3V model's slightly academic terms, I recommend the three easy-to-understand questions: who, what, and how. That is &#34;who to serve&#34;, &#34;what to offer&#34;, and &#34;how to produce and deliver&#34;.    Kumar urges us to move from superficial market segments to strategic segments, i.e. where the organization must design separate delivery systems (how?) in order to obtain success.    The marketing philosophy always starts externally at the customer (who?) and works backwards towards solutions (what?), and finally adapts the firm's delivery system (how?). But a strong trend during the last decade has been on the internal perspective on core competences, such as procurement or production. This method means that we start with own unique capabilities in the delivery system (how?), which then is translated into solutions (what?) and finally customers (who?). Radical innovation often is created this way, e.g. the &#34;walkman&#34;. In practice of business development, we usually have to work in both directions. Marketing people will have to do the same.    By drawing your own &#34;who-what-how&#34; profile and do the same for your competitors, you'll often reach useful conclusions that are valuable for obtaining a real strategic differentiation. This could push to the strategic innovation with a company-wide perspective. This process could the marketing function lead.    QUALITY AWARD  I find Kumar's book readable, provocative and full of perspective. Marketing's grand old man, Philip Kotler, has written the preface and this serves a quality award, which it deserves. The two chapters on brand rationalisation and distribution channels, respectively, are both updated from the author's articles in Harvard Business Review, which again is a sign of quality.

But despite the authors' clever recommendations, an epilogue is missing, as the Internet revolution they announced did not materialise. The Internet EVOLUTION, however, lives on.    Blown to Bits is about the consequences of the Internet for businesses.    The most important conclusion in the book is that the combination of increased bandwidth, global interconnected electronic network, faster computers and open standards are abolishing the requirements up to now of balancing information reach with information richness.    One example is the alternative media that a company can select when potential customers are targeted. Newspaper ads can reach a broad audience with a limited and static message. At the other end of the scale, a personal meeting with the customer gives the opportunity for deep, detailed and interactive information.    Businesses' supply chains include the same balancing act. When firms do business, the number of partners is inversely correlated to the richness in the information of the interchange.    The Internet removes this balancing act because you suddenly can reach many partners without compromising on the level of detail and complexity of the information (vast reach AND vast richness).    According to the authors, the consequence is that the value chain is blown to bits. They call it deconstruction, which happens when the things economy increasingly is separated from the information economy. \\"Information is the kit that binds the value chains and supply chains\\". But the kit is eroding. Information is no longer embedded in the physical units. The economy for physical things and the economy for information are fundamentally different. Unlike physical assets, information (an idea, illustration, checklist, article, etc.) can be reproduced costless infinitely. And where things are worn out, information remains their original form.    Blown to bits contains a wealth of well-described cases like newspapers, banks, car dealers, stock brokers, computer hardware and last not least Encyclopaedia Britannica. In addition, the book includes many interesting text boxes with questions the reader can use for further consideration.    In the bright light of hindsight!  Blown to bits was published in the roaring heydays of the dot-com wave ... and it shows. In 2001, two years after Blown to bits was published, the authors admitted their mistakes in an article for their employer, Boston Consulting Group. They summarised the evolution:  1) It is increasingly clear that the new economy is not displacing the old one. Instead the old is in the process of transforming itself from within.  2) The Internet is NOT proving to be a disruptive technology (i.e. characterised by eliminating the advantages for existing market players). Instead, incumbents are using it to challenge their own business models.  3) Information does not, in general, \\"want to be free\\"; instead, intellectual property rights are being extended.    This does not imply that the Internet won't change a lot. Nor can we all can return safely to the good old ways of doing business. Rather, it means that all incumbents have got a second chance to get e-business right.    This conclusion concurs with the view of strategy professor Michael Porter (quoted August 2001 in Business Week)  \\"We need to see the Internet as complementary to other things the company does rather than contradictory or cannibalistic. That was a really fundamental mistake that many people made. They assumed that this was a disruptive technology that existing companies could not embrace as efficiently as a new company coming in with a clean sheet of paper.    And Porter concludes: \\"The Internet as a family of technologies will have a very powerful effect on operational effectiveness. We'll see deeper integration among service, sales, logistics, manufacturing, and suppliers.\\"    Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2004-08-31

Gallup's thorough research presented in this book reveal the \\"Four Keys of Great Managers\\" that should unlock the potential of each and every employee (the \\"... not\\" statements represent conventional wisdom according to the authors)    1. When selecting someone, they select for talent ... not simply experience, intelligence, or determination.  2. When setting expectations, they define the right outcomes ... not the right steps.  3. When motivating someone, they focus on strengths ... not on weaknesses.  4. When developing someone, they find him the right fit ... not simply the next rung on the ladder    So great managers don't believe that a person can achieve anything he sets his mind to. They don't try to help a person overcome his weaknesses (instead they devise a support system. Find a complementary partner. Or find an alternative role). They consistently disregard the golden rule - i.e. treat people as you would like to be treated - instead they acknowledge that each employee is unique and thus would demand different things of you, the manager! And they even play favourites (i.e. spend the most time with your best people).    Many of us know by experience that it is hard to manage others well. Continually, you have to balance the competing interests of the employee, the customer, the company, and even yourself. You attend too much to one, and you invariably upset the others.     This book cannot make the manager's role easier. But it certainly provides you with some brilliant insights into effective people management. The book's Four Keys should be inspiring for any people manager, even if you do not accept all of their findings. At least, you'll find yourself challenged as they document their conclusions based on 80,000 interviews.    I have found their twelve questions to measure the strength of a workplace very helpful for regular individual reviews as well:    [What dothe employee get?]  1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?  2. Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?    [What do the employee give?]  3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?  4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?  5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?  6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?    [Do the employee belong here?]  7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?  8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel like my work is important?  9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?  10. Do I have a best friend at work?    [How can we all grow?]  11. In the last six months, have I talked with someone about my progress?  12. At work, have I had opportunities to learn and grow?\\"    I liked the book so much that I also bought the audio CD, which is enthusiastically read by Cunningham with a British accent.    At last, one of my favourite quotes from this book:    People don't change that much.   Don't waste time trying to put in what was left out.  Try to draw out what was left in.  That's hard enough.

With 130 online reviews many issues are covered already. One point's missing, though. Look at the reviews; they are divided into two camps. The reviewers either think this is a mediocre book with very basic ideas (management 101) or they see the light. The latter realize that there's no need for new acronyms or faddy words in the management-speak. \\"Execution\\" is about getting things done, being persistent and realistic, as well as managing the 3 core processes; strategy (why? and what?), operations (how?) and people (who?).      Building a performance culture is never as easy as it sounds. Looking back a few years, try to recall a few of those companies with great media attention and grand strategic visions. Many of them failed. And many of them will fail again and again, because the heroes are strategic visionaries that never bothered to deal with the issue of execution; continually and personally making sure that things were actually done. You know, when all is said and done, usually more is said than done...      If you found this book fascinating, you'll probably have some of the execution traits hidden in your personality preferences. If you want to check it out, you might visit some of free Internet sites for a test (e.g. keirsey.com). For a business, I believe it's paramount to make sure that you have a well-balanced team on all levels in the hierarchy. This also includes having enough executives with execution traits. Advice: Don't assume you have it; test it!      Conclusively, this is a great book. I liked it so much that I even also bought the audio version! The reason for the audio version is that these execution ideas simply are needed to be absorbed over several readings (or listenings). Otherwise, you won't be able to start changing your behavior (which you can change, unlike your innate preferences). While commuting, I often turn the CDs on and find it inspiring to forget about traffic jams and just getting the views of Charan and Bossidy in their own voices. However, I do agree that the book easily could have been shorter.     Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business	2004-08-03
US	32525887	RM8YWK36NEK6B	1591840015	903349723	Less Is More: How Great Companies Use Productivity	Books	5	3	3	N	N	On the lean culture of cost leadership firms	This spring, I had a night-flight from Houston to Europe. I never got any sleep due to this book. It reads like a fiction novel while the focus is very much on the softer issues of productivity businesses. The well-written behind-the-wall stories and interviews with successful top executives give us insight to many issues that usual case stories do not explain.    Business magazines often glorify top executives by telling about the grand strategic plan behind the success. This little book shows us a different story. It provides insight to the many seemingly small traits of the lean culture that only works because they taken serious by the organization and used in combination. These are the 11 traits required for the leader of a highly productive enterprise: attention to detail, high moral fiber, embracing simplicity, competitiveness, long-term focus, disdain for waste, coach leadership, humility, rejection of bureaucracy, belief in others, and trust.    I'm sure you're really not impressed of this list. Neither am I. But try challenging some of the advice. Humility? When was the last time you saw a big company using this as a standard. When you hear the story of many head offices visited in this book, you'll understand humility. Often you'll find a very simple and humble office building for a huge company. No art on the walls! No lavish entrance hall! In these companies, you don't find huge corporate staff creating immense bureaucracy and all sorts of information requirements from their operating companies or business units. These organizations do actually \\"walk-the-talk\\" on lean  - unlike many fad-driven major firms who's paying lip service to a lean culture.     PERSISTENCE is a word missing from the 11 traits, though attention to detail and long-term focus do include some of it. They never lose sight of their BIG idea or focus. It includes their performance measurement. \\"Everyone who works for SRC gathers once a week in their respective lunchrooms and takes partin a review of the business's financial performance for the previous week. By DOING IT WEEK IN WEEK-OUT FOR MANY YEARS the exercise has also become a system\\".    Okay, I'm sure that the book's research on productivity could have been better. And some of the firms reported on may experience difficulties, though most are still flourishing. But don't read this book for the hard stuff. Read the soft issues that over time usually turn out to be the hardest to beat.    I agree that it resembles \\"In Search of Excellence\\" to some degree, but remember that this book is on the lean culture of Cost Leadership firms (my interpretation, not the author's).

I've read more than 5 books in English and German on the catalog subject and Schmid's book is in a class of its own.    It promises to cover the entire catalog process, including strategic planning, merchandising, creative, marketing (circulation), fulfillment, testing, and measuring response and ROI. And it delivers on the promise to an extend that I've never seen before. I spend this summer in Cannes, France, and enjoyed Schmid's book in the hot sun. Just couldn't put it aside...    His 11 pages long spreadsheet model in appendix includes everything for a new catalog start-up feasibility study ... and provides insight for the budgeting process to more experienced catalogers. [Why doesn't he provide a downloadable version in Excel on his homepage?]    The only competitor to this book is probably Katie Muldoon's 1995-publication, which is out of print (her home page says that a new book on the strategic aspects of catalogs is forthcoming).    One weakness that all books on cataloging have so far is their unserious treatment of the Internet. Schmid's book is from 2000 and it shows. It doesn't contain solid work on dynamic publishing, which is exploding via the Internet these years. It's not that Schmid doesn't accept that the Internet will be a phenomenal factor, but in this area so much of the catalog processes have been digitized since 2000. Thus, on this promise it doesn't deliver.    I still recommend this book as the best source so far to understanding all the catalog processes and hints to improving the bottom-line.

US	32525887	R20JZLDW17RSBH	047148590X	734772833	Managing Customer Relationships: A Strategic Framework	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Taking One-to-One marketing to the CEO's agenda	Having just finalised an e-business thesis on Online Personalization, I must say that this book is an impressive source on the strategic level for what is synonymously called CRM, One-to-One marketing, relationship marketing, etc.     What I like about Peppers & Rogers is that they don't pretend to be the only ones to have seen this shift in customer-focused organizations (although they were first-movers in US by coining the term One-to-One in 1993). Peppers & Rogers accept readily that many other people have interesting perspectives to add. Thus, this book includes many contributions from marketing wizards like Philip Kotler, Seth Godin, Bruce Kasanoff, and Patricia Seybold.    The book is the sixth from the authors. If you have read some of the previous publications, you'll already be familiar with their core concepts like the IDIC-model (Identify-Differentiate-Interact-Customize), as well as Learning Relationships and customer Lifetime Value.     I believe that Peppers & Rogers' most important contribution is to change a company's focus from customer acquisition to customer retention. That is: Stop spending all you money getting new customers and start spending more on keeping and growing existing customers. This is where the learning relationships come in. The basic idea of Managing Customer Relationships, the authors concisely describe in plain English:    The Learning Relationships work like this: If you're my customer and I get you to talk to me, and I remember what you tell me, then I get smarter and smarter about you. I know something about you my competitors don't know. So I can do things for you my competitors can't do, because they don't know you as well as I do. Before long, you can get something from me you can't get anywhere else, for any price. At the very least, you'd have to start all over somewhere else, but starting over is more costly than staying with me.    Being a Dane, I'm proud to see the reference made on page 172 that the relationship theory can be traced back to the Scandinavian School of Relationships Management (e.g. Gronroos and Gummeson). Back in the 1980's, both were required reading in Scandinavian business schools. They often researched service firms and B2B-networks and based on this knowledge, they emphasised the contents and types of the business relationships and the required strategies to make these relationships work. It wasn't until the 1990's that CRM-initiatives took off in the United States - and usually they have been very technology-driven. Today, we all accept that you need both the relationship mindset and the technology-enabler. So the two approaches may ultimately achieve the same goals.
