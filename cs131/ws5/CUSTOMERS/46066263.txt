The Anglo-American Establishment is a detailed account of the growth and operations of that group, from its origins in Cecil Rhodes' secret society and its flowering under Sir Alfred Milner to its role in fostering the Commonwealth of Nations.

These deaths are still being concealed and denied, writes Bacque, especially by American and British authorities. Crimes and Mercies -- a handsome hardcover work, illustrated and well-referenced -- is a devastating indictment of Allied, and especially American, occupation policy in defeated postwar Germany. Nearly 15 million Germans fled or were brutally expelled in the greatest act of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in history, a human catastrophe in which some two million were killed or otherwise perished. Then, under the notorious \\"Morgenthau Plan\\" and its successor policies, the Allies carried out a massive looting of Germany, and even prevented German civilians from growing enough food to feed themselves. Bacque shows, for example, that General Eisenhower, in violation of the Geneva Convention, in May 1945 forbade German civilians to take food to prisoners starving to death in American camps. He threatened the death penalty for anyone feeding prisoners. Bacque also describes the terrors of the postwar camps in Poland where children and other German civilians lost their lives. Written with fervor, compassion and humanity, and making use of never-before cited records in Moscow archives, James Bacque exposes a little-known but important chapter of 20th century history. He builds upon the revelations of his startling 1989 study, Other Losses, which presented evidence to show that hundreds of thousands of German prisoners of war died as a result of cruel and illegal mistreatment by American, British and French authorities.

These three gripping historical novels on the beaten South's bitter \\"Reconstruction\\" years chronicle the birth of the first Ku Klux Klan; they helped give rise to the second. Published together for the first time in this magnificent volume are three classics: The Leopard's Spots, the story of Yankee oppression in the occupied South (1865-1900); The Clansman, on white resistance to tyranny and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan; and The Traitor, which traces the Klan's fall. Born of the author's own experience, the work captures all the poignancy of the tragic post-Civil War era in the South, and all the passion with which its despoiled and disenfranchised people rose up to reclaim their rights and safeguard their heritage. No popular work has addressed America's race problem with more searing frankness. You'll marvel at the parallels between the efforts in the 1860s and 1870s of money-hungry Yankee capitalists and earnest, misguided do-gooders to throttle white Southerners, and today's still-unfolding drama of American racial politics. Long out of print, now completely reset in a modern, easy to read typeface.

Here he examines the fascinating relationship between Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the crucial Jewish role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the harmful impact of America's Jewish-dictated policy in the Middle East, the threat posed by Israel to world peace and security, and the pivotal Jewish role in the Communist takeover of Russia.<br /><br />Duke also takes a skeptical look at the \\"Holocaust\\" story, and the sordid history of Zionism, including the long record of Zionist terrorism, provides an overview of Jewish-Zionist treachery against America, and reviews the Jewish role in radically changing US immigration policy to encourage massive Third World migration.

In this fast-paced memoir, a seasoned German-American author tells why he volunteered, as a teenager, during the final months of the war for service in the famed SS Leibstandarte panzer division of the elite Waffen SS. He describes his role in the furious winter combat of the \\"Battle of the Bulge,\\" in bloody fighting in Hungary, and during the final, desperate battles in Austria. After finally surrendering to U.S. troops on May 6, 1945, he was held -- along with hundreds of thousands of other German prisoners of war -- under brutal conditions in primitive stockades without shelter. Thanks to the kindness of individual GIs, he was spared transfer to Soviet imprisonment, or prolonged custody in U.S. internment. He then migrated to the United States, where he built a successful life and became a U.S. citizen. Told from an unapologetically German point of view, Schmidt provides a frank, \\"politically incorrect\\" explanation -- with a keen regard for American sensibilities -- of the appeal of the Third Reich regime, and the realities of the Hitler Youth and the Waffen SS. He boldly tackles such sensitive subjects as the \\"Malmedy massacre\\" and the destruction of the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane by SS troops in an anti-partisan reprisal.

As head of the dynasty that had ruled Russia for three centuries, Nicholas II personified his land and people. His cold-blooded murder by order of Lenin and Sverdlov was thus symbolic of the Communist effort to obliterate a rich national and cultural heritage, and presaged the terrible Soviet bloodletting of later years.

In this closely argued study a French scholar subjects Gerstein's accusations to critical examination, striking at the very roots of the Holocaust extermination story. The stunning conclusion: not only are Gerstein's allegations of mass killings of Jews groundless, but prominent Holocaust historians have deliberately manipulated and falsified key parts of Gerstein's tortured testimony. This powerful expos&eacute; and its author made world headlines in 1986 when, for the first time in the nearly eight-century history of French universities, a duly awarded doctorate was revoked by government order. Gerstein's bogus \\"confessions\\" were the basis of the anti-German and anti-Catholic hysteria stirred by Rolf Hochhuth's play \\"The Deputy.\\" Roques' study thus shatters the myth of a Vatican cover-up of Holocaust genocide.

Classic revisionist study of how FDR maneuvered America, against the wishes of most of its citizens, into war against Germany and Japan, and how FDR's war policy ended in betrayal, disillusion and endless conflict. Establishes convincingly that U.S. participation in World War II was neither necessary, nor desirable, nor just.

Presently available books approach the issue only at an angle:  technical works hail nuclear science as the greatest achievement of man;  military books bestow honor upon those who carried out their difficult duty.  Whereas eyewitness accounts, numbering two thousands but all in Japanese, are mostly confined to personal miseries..No, no total picture has as yet been presented.<br />In this book the author tells a unique and interesting story, as seen from the inside core of Japan, and submits a view of japanese thinking and experience.  He is exceptionally qualified - he walked through the city of Hiroshima on fire!  A personal experience of a nuclear bomb.<br />Mr Kohchi, a longtime United Nations finance officer (known as Albert Kawachi), deftly weaves a story of politico-economic threads around the atom-bombing, including the day-to-day living experiences of his family.  As he has miraculously come out of the never-to-be-repeated ordeal, in more than once sense, this book is complete drama, a real eye-opener, most important for those who think of catastrophe in our nuclear age, and living through it.	2002-12-18

A key figure in the arial campaigns over England, Russia, the Mediterranean, and the Arctic.  Baumbach became head of the Luftwaffe's Bomber Command before his thirtieth birthday.  In this book he gives a detailed, frank, inside account of Germany's air war, seen from the top:  Hitler as leader and strategist; assessments of such Luftwaffe leaders as Goring, Milch, Udet, Jeschonnek, and Galland; and the great controversies over tactics and strategy that help decide the war.	2002-12-11

Knowledgeable, lucid English attorney F.J.P. Veale does more than skewer the judicial outrages of the trials of the Germans and their allies: he shows that these trials, by demonizing the defeated and glossing over the crimes of the victors, abolished the traditional code that had ruled European warfare for centuries. In a revisionist refresher course on mdern history, Veale draws on precedents from Napoleonic wars onto demonstrate the hollowness and hypocrisy of the Allies' judgement of the Germans. The Gulf War, Bosnia, and Kosovo seem validation for this books' prediction, grounded in its author's analysis of the IMT that Nuremburg would make future warfare worse for non-combatants by dividing warring nations into good (us) and evil (them).	2002-12-11

Stoddard criss-crossed the Third Reich to observe nearly every aspect of its political, social, economic, and military life, and he talked with men and women from all walks of life, from Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels to taxi drivers and chambermaids. The result -- Into the Darkness -- is not only a classic of World War II reportage, but a unique evaluation of Germany's National Socialist experiment. For Stoddard was no ordinary journalist. A Harvard Ph.D in history, the author of The Rising Tide of Color and other works that played a key role in the enactment of America's 1924 immigration act, fluent in German and deeply versed in European politics and culture, Stoddard brought to Into the Darkness a sophistication and a sympathy impossible for William Shirer and a myriad of other journalistic hacks. To be sure, the New England Yankee Stoddard was no supporter of the Hitler dictatorship, but he was deeply interested in National Socialist policies, above all in the social and the racial sphere. Reading Into the Darkness brings you to hearings before a German eugenics court, to an ancestral farm in Westphalia, to the headquarters of the National Labor Service, to German markets, factories, medical clinics, and welfare offices, as keenly observed and analyzed by Stoddard. You'll read, too, of Stoddard's conversations with German policy makers in all fields: Hans F. K. Guenther and Fritz Lenz on race and eugenics; Walther Darr&eacute; on agriculture; Robert Ley on labor; Gertrud Scholz-Klink on women in the Third Reich; General Alexander L&ouml;hr on the Luftwaffe's Polish campaign, as well as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and many other leaders. And you'll travel with Stoddard to Slovakia, where he interviews Monsignor Tiso, the national leader later put to death by the Communists, and to Hungary, where the Magyars, still at peace, gaze apprehensively at Soviet Russia. Into the Darkness (so named from the mandatory air-defense blackout that Stoddard found so vexing) shines a torch of sanity and truth against the vituperation of all things National Socialist that has been practically obligatory for the past sixty years. Knowledgeable, urbane, skeptical, and above all fair, Stoddard's book is a unique, an indispensable historical document, a time capsule for truth, and a stimulating page-turner for everyone interested in the Third Reich and the German people.he national leader later put to death by the Communists, and to Hungary, where the Magyars, still at peace, gaze apprehensively at Soviet Russia.

Banned from entering the USSR, fired from the Tribune at the instance of the U.S. State Department, Day threw in his lot with the brave Finns and their German allies during their anti-Bolshevist crusade. Onward Christian Soldiers bristles with Day's insights and reminiscences of northern Europe -- Scandinavia, Germany, Poland, Danzig, Lithuania, and his beloved Latvia, Estonia, and Finland in the years between the wars. With an introduction by legendary Tribune correspondent Walter Trohan, Onward Christian Soldiers pulls no punches on the Jewish role in Communism and on Britain and America's hypocrisy in posing as defenders of Christian civilization.	2002-12-11

Millard has made a name for himself by opposing illegal immigration, and the virtually uncontrolled legal immigration we current enjoy in the U.S. As a result, he is often labelled a racist. &quot;The Outsider&quot; is a book that, according to its promotional materials, deals with race and race relations in a politically-incorrect fashion. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Millard exploits and sensationalizes racial issues, but in the end it turns out to be nothing more than posturing, and he provides an unsatisfying ending for his tale that seems to be crafted for no other reason than thumbing his nose at anyone who might be waiting to label him a racist (or even racialist). Therefore, rather than being a book about race and race relations, it is merely a second-rate story that uses low-grade racial situations as a hook to lure readers. It's difficult to imagine who might enjoy reading this book.	2002-10-25

The cover blurbs would have you believe that Kit Miller, a working-class hero, somehow penetrated the ruthless security of Nevada casinos to tell the stories of those down-trodden by the evil gambling empires. In reality, Kit Miller comes from a wealthy family, and she had little difficulty gaining access to the casinos. To her credit, Miller sets aside her liberal political heritage, and presents her subjects' stories in a highly readable manner, free of ideological slant. Her subjects are no more exploited than any other working persons, and their employers are no more evil than those outside the gaming industry. This is, however, a well-done book, and although Miller's main credit is as the photographer, she is a deft writer. It's just not the book you might expect from reading the ham-handed back-cover blurb.	2000-12-28
