Books	3	8	11	N	N	Fun facts	Like all of the \\"Imponderables\\" books this is great fun to peruse and read the 1-2 page summaries of commonplace questions with often surprisingly complex answers.  A good amount of the book is devoted to \\"Frustables\\" (Imponderables that won't be answered) and letters / comments from readers.  This means the book proper is much shorter than it first appears, but it also adds to a sense of serialization and community among the Imponderables readers, which is nice.  And yes, penguins do have knees.	2002-05-22

Rockefeller (American Dream Series)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Straightforward bio	Coffey examines John's life from his childhood days watching his father show up intermittently with money overflowing his pockets to John's tough early days seeking employment in Cleveland to his controlling of virtually all of the US oil supply.  Coffey mentions repeatedly that John was \\"the most hated man in America\\" but focuses more on his charitable giving than on his inducing spite.  John is portrayed as a hard worker and one who made some opportune choices in which industries to pursue, but he was not a particularly inventive businessman.  He did surround himself with quality partners, though.  One shortcoming is that the extent of John's wealth is never made clear; how did it compare to other financial giants of his time as well as how would it compare (taking into account inflation, of course) to people like Forbes and Bill Gates today?  Also, a few items are alluded to but not developed, such as the enmity within the family for John by his brother Frank (and possibly others?) and the lack of friendship between John and J.P. Morgan.  Being intended for a young adult readership I wouldn't expect all details to be present but since the book repeatedly mentions that John was \\"the most hated man\\" focusing a bit more on specific individuals who disliked him and how that dislike was manifested would add to the story.  In general though the portrait of the intense, charitable yet borderline unscrupulous business tycoon provides enough details of personal and business life to satisfy.	2002-05-22

Dean Moriarty and the narrator (Sal) travel across the country multiple times, even venturing down to Mexico.  The two play off of each other, with Dean showing glimpses of maturity followed by long spans of juvenile delinquency whereas the narrator seems to steadily grow older.  Other than the aging / loss of youth theme I latched onto there are probably deeper interpretations to derive (the search for ones ancestors?).  But this is a nice novel you can read at face value and not worry about the deeper meanings.  A good read, somewhat depressing; my only complaint is that the ever-shifting background of other characters is never well-defined and they never really develop their own personalities, nor do the towns and bars they stop in.  Perhaps that facelessness of surroundings as they travel is one of Kerouac's points. Sal does seem excessively degenerate / immoral / promiscuous at times but the couple of tender scenes with his aunt somewhat offset this.	2002-05-22

The late 1800s Catholic Academy is an ideal setting for T.D. to let leash his shenanigans.  All his friends and enemies and pigeons are a rather faceless, mindless bunch for him to see his ruses succeed against (it's almost like everybody is the straight sidekick) but that's a necessary plot device to make the stories unfold.  Seeing T.D.'s wonder while riding the train is a delight.  Great fun; a worthy installment in this not-too-often-mentioned classic children's series.	2002-05-22

A plot that makes up for its lack of believability / lack of development with the sheer volume of its ideas and its droll British humor.  We follow along with the persistently boggled Arthur Dent and along the way find out how to mix a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster, the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything, and the true purpose of both little white mice and the Earth.  What more can you ask for?<br />As a cult classic, it falls firmly into the \\"you love it or you hate it\\" category.  This first book in the series presents an easy way to spend a few hours with a quick paperback and determine which category you fall into.  If you love it, there's 4 more books and a few other Adams works to explore; if you fall into the \\"hate it\\" category you've only lost a few hours (though apparently at some previous point in time you lost your soul, but oh well).	2002-05-22
US	45169295	R2W82EANMYPK8A	0870448536	52394166	Our country's presidents	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Great overview	The 5-10 page descriptions of our first 40 presidents (the edition I read ended with Ronald Reagan still in office) provide a literally colorful look at America's history.  Each description includes the presidential portrait and is accompanied by plentiful photographs and contemporary illustrations.  The book is a collection of a 5-part series National Geographic published some years ago and thus the high quality of that publication is included here.  Since it covers each president in its less than 300 pages, this is admittedly an overview / introduction to the presidents and does not go into depth on any issues.  But given that this was its purpose the book does a fine job.  Younger readers will find the pictures and captions get across many of the main points, while older readers can use it as a springboard to seek out more in-depth books focusing on either specific presidents or specific events in America's past.	2002-05-22

It contained a pleasant mix of hard science, accounts of sensationalistic disasters, and the effects on the environment / cultures.  The usual mind-boggling amount of details and facts are accompanied by numerous pictures and drawings to keep younger and more mature readers interested.  One oddity is that this ended on a seemingly odd topic--the role of gods and religion in peoples interpretation of volcanoes and earthquakes.  Just prior to this the study of volcanoes, and improvements in detection / building codes had been addressed (a very forward-looking topic) but then the last page is about gods (a historical perspective topic).

Stranger has a sense of scope, as we see Michael transformed from a nearly helpless \\"babe\\" physically to a polished, mass-media darling preacher.  The \\"high-minded\\" science fiction aspect is key to the novel as Heinlein uses his stranger and his attempts at understanding humanity to emphasize the flaws in our society.  It never becomes overbearing or preachy, but the zealously hedonistic and somewhat smarmy society that results from following Michael's ideas seems as flawed as our own.  I'm unsure if I'm to interpret Michael's world as the answer to our problems or simply a lifestyle with an alternative set.<br />Without turning this into a critique or a plot summary, it boils down to an interesting narrative, a few deeper meaning details (e.g. the scenes in heaven) that didn't really work for me, but in general a highly intelligent person engaging in skilled storytelling and sharing of his thoughts.	2002-05-22

In the hands of a less astute person Mazes for the Mind would be meaningless drivel.  But Pickover is like a wonderful uncle you see a few times a year for holidays; he is full of fascinating tales to share.  Anyone who is interested in how math shows up in odd places, and who has some familiarity with relatively advanced topics like chaos theory, number theory, topology, etc. should find plenty to occupy their minds in this work.  Though some of the sections are too brief, the quick tours through each topic are generally enjoyable.<br />I'm most interested to see what other Pickover works are available.	2002-03-27

Alyce as the midwife's apprentice is likable enough; the midwife to which she is slave / apprentice is vaguely harsh yet makes a pivotal inspirational speech which Alyce overhears.  The characters in general seem half-realized.  We meet Will and I expected him to develop into a true companion of Alyce's but this never occurs; similarly, the scholar and the innkeeper are described once to flesh them out a bit but they are never developed further.  The plot is similarly simple--definitely more than a quick / stupid plot, but it feels like it was lacking in the complexity and inventiveness that would make a truly memorable tale.  Enjoyable nonetheless due to the setting and quick pace.	2002-03-27

Flipping it open, one finds such important questions as: who's the best baseball player?  which art museum is best? addressed.  These are all questions that people have idled away time answering; the value Poundstone adds is having researched them.  He provides just enough information--even on topics for which I don't have much expertise I found his commentary interesting.  Even for those who don't care about the details the book is worth flipping through to see the comparative charts and conclusions.<br />Some of his choices of important questions to answer seem a bit odd (what's the most difficult shot in billiards) but even these result in a brief, interesting chapter devoted to some topic I'd never previously pondered.	2002-03-27

The \\"Eaten One\\" is an interesting heroine to accompany through the novel.  She is a believable mix of questioning youth, maturing young adult, petulant girl, and above all humane thinker.  The story is marginally enjoyable until Ged appears in the underground maze.  At that point it takes off as the two interact and Ged's mythical / heroic goodness brings out the good elements in Arya's character.<br />Though at times Ged's persona seems almost too good and farcical, LeGuin does not go overboard with her portrayal.  As mentioned earlier she does an outstanding job with Arya's character and is able to capture the range of emotions she experiences in her growing and meeting Ged.  I thank LeGuin for NOT including a gratuitous romantic element between the two.<br />My only complaint is that the book was too brief; that we do not get to see how Ged and Arya interact once they escape from Atuan.	2002-03-21

But Bell is quite a disappointment.  The 1930s-era characters seem to be speaking an off-putting and unwieldy gringo Shakespeare (\\"Thou hast crossed the arroyo, Ingles\\").  Moreover, the revolving themes of duty and honor and the instrument of war / administration vs. the individuals who carry out the specific deeds don't seem to develop.  Rather, the reader is subject to endless conversations with rather boring people, then Robert Jordan muses in an unenlightening manner upon the conversations he's had.  About 1/3 of the way through the book I was thinking \\"just blow the damn bridge up, make love to Maria, and go home.\\"  Having skimmed the Cliffs Notes, apparently it takes a few hundred more pages for that to happen; pages I am unwilling to read.	2002-03-21

There is both high action in the encounters with Catso and time for thinking in the introspection provided by Chum the gerbil.  The only shortcoming is that I was looking for a little more solid of a change in Garfs character; he starts off as a loner and I expected Ralph and him, through their bonding, would each learn to appreciate their peers more.

Moreover, the mathematics and real numbers work are present enough to drive away non-mathematically minded readers but completely lacking in enough detail to hold the remaining readers.

Her transformation from frightened stranger to staunch defender of the Bhutanese lifestyle (and Buddhist religion) in the face of her negative friends and family is predictable.  However, at no time does it seem forced or unnatural.  Rather, Zeppa's sincere appreciation for the Bhutanese lifestyle comes through clearly.<br />What I find most memorable in her story is the fact that she acknowledges Bhutan's shortcomings.  Yes, they have a more simple way of life that is rustically appealing; but the resulting poverty and manual labor is heinous.  And like every Western nation Bhutan struggles with national identity and racism.  Also, the students are both silent and unwilling to question authority, something the Western students do to excess.  Zeppa considers these flaws openly when deciding in which culture she would prefer to remain.<br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable read, with impressive and straightforward information interspersed with meaningful opinions.  The only shortcoming I feel is the abrupt ending, where following her marriage to a Bhutanese native we find that Zeppa and her spouse found unexpected differences leading to her spending more time in Canada than planned.  Perhaps providing details on this aspect would require too much prying into Zeppa's life; in that case of course I do not fault her for omitting such details.	2002-03-21

From there the focus is on how Newton's mathematical, deterministic laws of motion and gravity were found to be too simplistic.  Rather than a complex but predictable universe, numerous instances of controlled chaos exist--for example, Saturn's moon Hyperion cannot have its motion completely predicted but it moves within defined boundaries.<br />Not being terribly interested in astronomy I found the book to be a bit long-winded.  Peterson does a reasonably interesting job of placing astronomers and their discoveries into historical and cultural context; I just didn't particularly want to know such information.  Conversely, the details on the type of chaos and the implications of its presence seemed to be in short supply compared to what I would have wanted to know.  Nonetheless, the book presents its arguments clearly and quickly enough that armchair astronomers or chaos theorists should find perusing it worthwhile.	2002-03-21

Peters does it well.  The book moves along quickly, characters appropriately absurd while still functional in terms of moving the plot along.  Peabody's continuous commentary is vastly entertaining.  The only complaint I had in this novel was the side plot of Peabody being concerned with Emerson's fidelity; it distracted from the typical energy and closeness of the two detectives.<br />I'm sure within a few months I'll have completely forgotten the plot, but the memories of individual scenes (e.g. Emerson fighting off numerous \\"high priests\\" with Ramses clinging to his side) will be retained and cherished much longer.	2002-03-21

It tells the story of simple country-folk type Ged encountering both the wide world around him as well as the darkness that dwells within himself.<br />Earthsea is populated with straightforward individuals and a smattering of magical, otherworldly beings (including dragons).  It is a standard fantasy world, and the coming-of-age tale of Ged is a standard fantasy plot.  LeGuin's famous focus on the importance of names and their relation to being able to do magic is an interesting twist.<br />Perhaps given its age (first published in the 1960s, I believe) the book was groundbreaking at the time.  Read now, it is simply a solid novel that beckons one to read the next.	2002-02-17

The industrial New York setting comes across as seedy and gritty without being too overblown, and the narrator's somewhat modern perspective and voice allows the reader to feel somehow more familiar with this past time.  I can't vouch for the historical veracity but it felt real enough to me.<br />Like Crichton, Carr allows the reader to be taken on a thriller journey that includes bits and pieces of knowledge (NY underworld, psychology in the late 19th century) so the book feels less like brain candy.  Unlike Michener, Carr avoids drowning out his sense of storytelling in order to share his wealth of information.<br />Two weaknesses affect the story.  First, the narrator seems a bit of a buffoon--the old \\"why would the rest of these characters bother tolerating him.\\"  Second, Carr seems to think a dramatic denouement requires including every character who's appeared previously and providing them with a weapon.  A few pages of overblown drama are quite forgivable though in an otherwise well-researched and skillfully told novel.	2002-02-08

He seems incapable of keeping up with publishing demands and therefore is forced to submit rather uninteresting, poorly conceived, poorly executed drivel.  The Street Lawyer examines a fast-track younger middle-aged Michael, who has a life-changing event and begins helping the homeless with fervor.  His whole-hearted enthusiasm never flags despite the many hardships both physical and mental (and the separation from his wife).  He's the go-getter do-gooder I guess Grisham thinks we all should be.  It's not interesting.<br />The simple-mindedness of Michael is the book's greatest offense.  He is surprised by the animosity groups of homeless show him though (surprise again!) on an individual basis they are fine.  He is pushed into overdrive to help a single mother break her drug addiction.  He can MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  I would have much rather seen a more complex, involving plot around the eviction but that seems just a background for Grisham to preach to us by showing the reborn Michael.<br />The ending with its burgeoning romance / the reaction of Michael's former employer is repulsive.  If you've been frustrated by that point, these gems will send you over the edge.  I recall having read previous works and finding them either more complex (The Chamber, A Time to Kill) or more thrilling (The Firm, The Runaway Jury).  The Street Lawyer fails by both these criteria.	2002-02-08

Books I consider exemplary have a few qualities: straightforward but engaging narration, likable characters, and a plot which examines &quot;issues&quot; without becoming strained in doing so. To Kill a Mockingbird possesses each of these qualities. What makes it especially outstanding is the point of view and what is left unsaid. One main driver of the plot is an incident which we never witness and only learn of through some testimony. One of the main characters in relation to the plot we spend a scant few pages with--we never really know him in order to sympathize with him as a character. And another main character, Atticus, though extraordinarily quiet, maintains a powerful presence reminiscent of Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead.<br />The simplicity and one-sided nature of the trial can be considered a shortcoming, but they actually make the novel's point that much more powerful. It's believable that the jury would find Tom guilty despite his obvious innocence, and this emphasizes how much man can be cruelly unfair to his neighbor. The ending does seem a bit strained as Atticus somehow is unable to see who killed whom when his children were attacked, but this is a very minor flaw.<br />Overall To Kill a Mockingbird tells a powerful, emotional tale with the easy childhood innocence of its narrator. It makes the reader feel tremendously guilty, seeing what we as a society could be vs. what we unfortunately are. If we interpret this not as an accusation by Lee but rather as an inspiration then maybe we can improve things a bit.	2001-12-12

In a sense though the length of this book is its worst enemy.  He could have either been even more brief and cut about 50% of it to focus on the main issues rather than repeating himself.  Alternatively, he could have truly explored the characterization of the individuals behind the craze as well as probed the American psyche and increased the length by 50%.  Straddling the middle, Paint By Numbers ends up being pleasant but vaguely dissatisfying.	2001-12-02

Assassin's Quest provides a strong conclusion to the trilogy, and focuses more strongly on Fitz and Nighteyes than the previous two volumes.  For much of the novel Fitz and Nighteyes travel alone from the other main characters and this allows us to truly get to know him and the pains he suffers.  This is a good thing, in my opinion, despite Fitz's life being rather depressing as he is consistently betrayed or physically injured.<br />The plot moves along in a logical and meaningful way with enough surprises at the end to be unpredictable but at no time did I feel anything was unfairly surprising.  And her descriptions of how dragons are born as well as their qualities upon coming to life brought fresh ideas to these standards of fantasy fare.<br />Overall this is one of the best series I've read in fantasy and I'm very much looking forward to exploring Hobb's \\"Liveship Traders\\" series.  The world she built for the Assassin series is realistic, contains many unanswered questions, and I have a real sense of loss now that I'll no longer be visiting its inhabitants.	2001-12-02

We were whisked along through the thrill of Charlie obtaining one of the prized Golden Tickets and his tour through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with his Grandpa.  It's a bit of a moralistic romp; what sets this volume apart from other children's works?<br />The dark, almost maleficent flippancy of Willy Wonka is brilliant--the person handing out the moralistic lessons is not some smarmy do-gooder.  The manic playfulness of Willy Wonka combined with the general tall-tale quality of this book create a wonderful escape from the dreary world we and Charlie typically inhabit.	2001-12-02

I was expecting Schlosser to examine fast food restaurants and use their business properties, health qualities, expansion patterns, etc. as a springboard to examine and explain the American psyche.  This he did in the introduction and somewhat consistently in part I, although his histories of Carl's and McDonald's drifted a bit too long.  But in the more lengthy part II the book went into the same old story of: American farmers and ranchers and blue-collar workers have lost their power, lost their independence, have been turned into efficiency machines by big business.  And this is spreading like some terrible disease throughout the world.<br />Schlosser's points are valid but they're not the reason I picked up the volume, so it became a bit of a skim-a-thon.  Oh well.	2001-10-18

Such novels typically end up half-read and remembered as immature drivel.  But Robbins is a skilled chef and has added the key final ingredient: a healthy pinch of perspective and philosophizing.<br />So Cowgirls becomes a playful romp through the life of hitchhiking Sissy Hankshaw and her association with \\"typical\\" society members (her husband, her employer) as well as atypical society members (Bonanza Jellybean, the \\"Chink\\").  These associations and influences are bridged by the eponymous Dr. Robbins.  Not all of Robbins' philosophy made sense, and sections of the book were boring / seemed purely absurd.  But his general theme of finding one's place and \\"making lemonade out of lemons\\" (a trite way of summarizing Robbins' work, admittedly) and the symbols of the majestically goofy cranes work quite nicely.<br />It'll be awhile before I'm ready for another Robbins but I will certainly be reading another.	2001-10-18

We have the flawed and raised-from-the-common man-role hero with surprisingly strong magical talents, the political intrigue, the unknown ominous evil, the reclusive guide, the burly stable master, and the vaguely annoying love interest.  But any story can be reduced to a series of stereotypes--the key is how the author builds off these basic ingredients.<br />On the other hand we have a fully-drawn main character surrounded by a cast of supporting characters whose actions are believable and whose flaws and struggles somehow hit home.  Hobb has done a great job creating a background and historical framework within which her plot lines function.  Rather than launch into a plot summary I'll just state that the standard elements of a complex political intrigue-style fantasy series are all here and Hobb handles them adeptly.<br />The strongest elements are the fact that Fitz is never cloying as a hero--he struggles to do the right thing and sometimes acts irresponsibly / out of anger.  He's fun to accompany.  His wolf companion brings a nice \\"simple viewpoint of a guide\\" contrast to the \\"complex viewpoint from a mystical guide\\" supplied by Chade.  The one weak part is the ongoing and rather boring romance with Molly.  Fitz is kept incredibly busy by the events in the novel; his romance adds needlessly.  Whatever--the third volume will soon be read for the surely satisfying conclusion.	2001-10-18

Ostensibly the novel focuses on the airline industry.  But for me the more compelling story line was how the media interacts with big business and how it chooses to tell its stories.  Though the television story developer and her star reporter are a bit too extreme, seeming more parodies than believable characters, Crichton's points retain their validity.<br />The ending snippets supposedly culled from various news sources put a nice finishing touch on the novel, both wrapping up its plot lines and emphasizing Crichton's media theme.  I imagine he must have been grinning mischievously when penning the final snippet--a brilliant ending to a solid read.	2001-09-13

Ramona's childish randomness is completely believable, while Beezus' struggle to come to terms with her relationship with her younger sister provides a &quot;moral&quot; to the book without ever becoming cloying.<br />This is a volume that belongs on everybody's bookshelf, and should displace all the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; and whatever else clutters the average youngster's shelves.	2001-09-11

It boils down to: a sprawling narrative, a bunch of zany characters, a strong sense of tragicomedy, a few sex scenes, a few gory scenes, a little bit of everything.  Irving is known for this, and at times things get out of control or seem strained in his works.  However, for some reason all the elements fit together perfectly in Garp.<br />Beneath all of the highjinks going on Garp seems most of all to be a story underlined by sadness, a novel whose events are controlled by an undercurrent (an &quot;under toad&quot;, perhaps) of CHANGE.  In this sense it's similar to the Lord of the Rings--another sprawling, incredible tale.<br />PS The movie didn't seem to do the book justice.	2001-09-11

We have a common boy thrust into an important role with whom the reader can relate and political intrigue (clouding the overt evil presence) that is left unclear at the end of the novel, thus leading into the others in the series.  But Hobb does a good job of keeping the characters interesting and the plot moving along without depending on gruesome battle sequences.  The first-person narrative voice also allows the reader to immediately relate to Fitz.  The best element of the book is perhaps the strong sense of world-building.  Despite its 400+ pages AA leaves many items touched-upon but not fully developed, such as exactly how the magics are related and work; the history of the Outislanders and the people of the Six Duchies; the role and past of Fitz' teacher Chade.  By being not fully developed I mean the book / world has a feeling of reality and &quot;bigness&quot; rather than a feeling of being unfinished.  Finally, the whole concept of becoming an assassin is inventive.  So this is definitely NOT a book that falls into boring genre trappings.<br />After I finished AA my wife asked me if I would recommend it.  The book was not quite good enough to merit an UNSOLICITED recommendation.  But if someone were interested in reading Hobb but uncertain I definitely recommend this.  Of course, if the rest of the series improves or worsens that could alter the previous statements... we'll see in a few weeks.	2001-09-05

Rather than wax eternal about how wonderful this series is, I'll keep it brief and share a thought. That thought is to emphasize the sadness, the sense of humanity about LOTR. Tolkien's series is NOT simply about a ring and trying to destroy it, nor is it just about the battle between good and evil (both BETWEEN people and WITHIN themselves).<br />It is a series focused on the sadness of watching a world change (the Hobbits') as well as an entire race cease to be (the elves). The changes in LOTR are good, but they do not come without sacrifice. This theme, against the strong plot and tremendously well-developed fantasy world, make LOTR the all-time classic.	2001-09-05

Petzinger does a nice job of presenting the personalities who built and grappled over the airline industry from Lindbergh's historic flight through the early 1990s. A few timelines or charts showing how the various leaders moved throughout their careers would have been helpful; at times I lost track of who was responsible for what. But in general this is a well-researched and attractively-presented description of the world of flight.	2001-08-30

Basically, this tale boils down to a creature of the Wild learning that man is a &quot;god&quot; and that white men are gods compared to Native Americans.  In order for this Wild creature to survive he must learn to obey the rules made by these gods.  London apparently sees modern man, having no respect for nature or animals, as being the epitome of evolution.<br />The domestication of White Fang by the &quot;love master&quot; is perhaps the greatest tragedy I've ever read about.  Frighteningly, London presents it as a TRIUMPH.	2001-08-02

Though it provides a great number of examples of fairy and elf tales from around the world (mostly European, of course) it does NOT provide useful tables or lists of names for similar creatures.  Also, the book does not give meaningful overviews or summaries comparing and contrasting tales from different cultures.<br />It's part of a beautiful series from Time-Life books but is not a complete reference source.	2001-08-02
US	45169295	ROHC3P6NEJLJI	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Strong narrative and interesting story	Carrie is similar to Misery in that it is a very straightforward tale without too many characters (though Misery is the extreme in having few characters).  King shows his narrative power here in that the premise is fairly straightforward but he makes the story captivating and invigorating.  In a sense it feels a bit like King is showing off his ability to tell a good story by not having any secrets.  Via newspaper clippings and interview snippets after the present of the story the reader knows from the beginning that Carrie ends up dying, that the town is destroyed, and that the world has reacted to the events described.  This bit of \\"non-fictional\\" aspect to the novel is effective and fun.<br />Overall Carrie is a good choice both for King fans and fans of fine storytelling.	2001-07-09

At times it seems a little bit forced in the sense that the authror is trying very hard to show how much her characters suffer from the same concerns, fears, etc. of adolescents.  But overall the characters fit smoothly into the plot and the events are realistic / interesting.  A few too MANY problems are addressed--abusive parents, drug dependency, and alternative teaching methods--but the solid and believable ending make up for the shortcomings.

He writes thrillers, not mysteries--lots of action with a predictable and hackneyed plot but no interesting sleuthing to at least spice it up as in an Agatha Christie.  This book has some interesting sections on the &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; world of purchasing horses and kickbacks.  However, these bits of interest are outweighed by the silliness of the &quot;tragic hero&quot; with regards to both the love affair and Crispin.<br />If you like thrillers I guess it'll do but if you're looking for a mystery it's a poor choice.	2001-06-18

The opening criticisms of how economics is taught in today's university structure along with the inappropriate credence given this largely theoretical topic's conclusions are well-presented and well-received.  Similarly, the general theme of the recommendations is presented very nicely.  Basically, we must focus on more local goods, more self-sufficiency in communities.  The authors take the time and care to address such technicalities as what exactly they mean by communities.  In general their care is a strength of the book, though perhaps more of the details could have been put in appendices or footnotes rather than disturbing the flow of the text.  My main complaint is that no EXAMPLES are given--real-life attempts, either successful or failed, at some of their recommendations.  Without examples, all their suggestions seem unsubstantiated.  A lengthy but decent read, with a nice underlying philosophy.	2001-05-29

All the main Heroes of the Lance are there but as seems to be the case outside of the core Dragonlance (Chronicles and Legends) everything is purely plot-driven rather than actually revealing more about a character.  Others in the Meetings Sextet (Dark Heart, Kindred Spirits) at least try to explore the individuals.

This novel reminds me of good John Irving.  It combines a healthy amount of plot to keep things moving, along with quirky / interesting characters that remain just normal and developed enough to avoid becoming farcical.  Moreover, the narrator is a strong central figure that ties things together and keeps the book focused.  Finally, the narrator goes through introspection and change, and Atwood gently guides the reader there via use of a \\"story within a story\\" that is never overbearing.  I know I didn't pick up on all of the symbolism and \\"deeper meanings\\" of Joan, but I know I enjoyed being along for the ride with her.  Very much recommended for the thoughtful reader.	2001-05-23

However, as a body of work they were interesting--the themes of lost childhood, changing sibling relationships, disgruntled musical prodigies, and general loneliness / rejection emerge and give a nice sense of continuity to the works.  The inclusion of two of her novellas is nice; I appreciate the longer story format for the ability to get to know the characters and setting a little better.<br />Overall I'd recommend picking up McCullers' novellas and if you're thrilled with those, tackle her short stories.	2001-05-04

Iggie's House begins as a pleasant read with an easily-accessible character and believably enjoyable high-jinks as Winnie grapples with the racism she didn't realize existed in her town, in her parents, and in herself.  A moral could be smoothly inserted without even seeming terribly pedantic.  However, the final few chapters, suffer a tremendous breakdown.<br />Blume chooses to treat the reader as an untrusting parent would treat an irresponsible child by not explaining any meaningful rationale behind the various parties' decisions regarding moving away.

But the point is that Peterson gives a skilled description of each area of mathematics.  There are enough pictures / illustrations and intuitive explanations / examples for a layman, but also enough &quot;real&quot; mathematics to inform one who has a decent background in math.  And of course, the additional resources listed for each chapter would allow one to more formally pursue a topic that captures one's interest.<br />Overall a very fun read.

Also, the structure of the novel works well in that each part is in a similar time-frame and deals with a similar relationship problem but views it from each family.  However, what I found annoying is that no character emerges as a strong, unifying force to which the reader can relate.  This ends up causing one to feel like there are a great number of vaguely-understood characters rather than one or two well-known and memorable characters with a supporting cast.  Perhaps that was Tan's intent--to have central ideas illustrated by numerous characters.  But I'm not into novels of ideals so that would be lost on me.<br />In summary, a good read and I look forward to exploring her more recent works.  Just not on my &quot;best ever&quot; list.	2001-04-09

This is definitely better than Oath and Measure, so if you're reading the Meetings Sextet in order then at least things improve.  The meeting between Tanis and Kitiara is VERY lacking in drama--they simply fall into each others arms in a mixture of battle and unexpected lust.  This should have been handled much more carefully.<br />The non-Chronicles characters are extremely enjoyable in the sense that they add a depth to the novel and allow it to be an original story.  However, the plot itself isn't very complex--a bad guy wants power, yawn.  Also, there are almost too many other characters--I felt like the dynamic between the two mages could have been its own novel, but Ellen was &quot;forced&quot; to write about Tanis and Kit instead.  As a result, neither relationship is developed appropriately.<br />Still, a decent read with good characters in a great realm.	2001-04-05

It is an enjoyable read, with the typical abundance of action and subplots in a John Irving (surprisingly, nobody ever dressed up in a bear suit!). However, the &quot;issues&quot; it attempts to address are not handled adeptly as in Garp or Owen Meany. Also, the book took some time to capture my interest--the first 150 to 200 pages (paperback) were slow going with too many characters being introduced. Once past that mark, though, things improved.<br />Definitely worth reading for those who are John Irving fans, but not to be read before his more famous works. One key indication that Son of the Circus was not as well-executed as his others is the fact that about half of the characters whose fates were addressed in the epilogue were people who I had to be reminded of in order to care what eneed up happening to them.	2001-03-22

Sturm is not one of my favorite characters, and the fairly wandering plot combined with the lack of interesting characters leads to a very tiresome novel.  Williams has a neat premise (someone who hates the Brightblades because of their lack of respect for the Oath and Measure) and incorporates his love of music into the novel.

The multiple points of view for narration are handled well, but Grace seems superfluous while Sam does not appear as one of the voices.  The general premise is solid, and the conclusion is intense--I did not know until the final sentences how things would turn out, and what the author presents is entirely plausible.  Definitely worth checking out despite some scenes that seem to add little.	2001-02-19
