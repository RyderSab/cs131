US	52164132	R2J43XO2JH69UQ	0375422765	253560182	War Trash	Books	5	27	33	N	N	Elegant and terse rumination on war	Although Ha Jin writes in English, it is apparent from page one that he is a Chinese writer.  His writing is similar in form to other popular Chinese writers like Yu Hua.  Short, dynamic sentences using mostly active voice.  There are also awkward phrases where it is apparent Ha Jin is translating Chinese sayings into English, often an ill fit.  Though this can subtract from the rhythm of the book, it is a tiny complaint, and it is just about the only thing wrong with this book.   <br /> <br />The narrator was a Chinese POW in an American camp during the Korean War.  He is telling his story years later, when he is an old man living in America.  In short, this is a story of the dehumanizing effect of war on man.  It is not a completely depressing read, however.  Through certain characters, the reader gets glimpses of hope and light: in the American soldier who befriends the narrator to discuss their girlfriends; the American general who is torn between bad international publicity and doing the right thing; and the young Chinese prisoner who the narrator takes under his wing and teaches to read.  These are the individual faces of war, and where they exist, the novel is full of emotion.  However, Ha Jin can turn a touching chapter into a tragedy in the blink of an eye, which is what makes this book so gripping and frightening.   <br /> <br />I have heard Ha Jin compared to Dostoevsky.  I have not read Dostoevsky's war memoirs, but have read his novels, and am strained to see any literary comparison, though I can see a philosophical one, I suppose...the struggle of the individual to come to terms with the madness around and inside of him.   <br /> <br />Warning:  This book is wonderful, but I wouldn't call it a page turner.  Be patient with it.	2005-01-31

It's a parody of a civics book, but so much better.  Some examples of things that made me laugh... <br /> <br />-(on a world timeline) \\"Chinese develop gunpowder, banking, newspapers, advanced medicine, paper mone.  Not Western.  Doesn't count\\" <br />-A game where you get to restore the Justices of the Supreme Court's dignity by putting their robes back on.  And yes, they're naked.   <br />- A game to match every Middle Eastern country (lettered A-O) to the corresponding number of their sworn enemy.  1. Israel.   <br />- Senate color by numbers!  You only need one crayon to play.  <br />- Discussion question: \\"Have you ever founded anything?  If so, did it go on to become a global superpower? If not, why not?  What is the main difference between democracy and cannibalism?\\" <br />- A chart stating Machiavelli's political beliefs (1. \\"It is better for leaders to appear virtuous than to actually be virtuous and 2. for a politician, the ends justify the means.\\") and his impact on American democracy (\\"None.\\") <br />- The British equivelent of the Dept. of Health and Human Services: Department of 'ealth and 'uman services.   <br /> <br />And lots lots more.  These are just the ones I flipped to.  This book doesn't lean left or right.  I see an earlier review says it is left-leaning.  They're Republican.  I'm on the left, and I thought it leaned a bit right.  That's conclusive proof it's in the middle.  The institution this book is hardest on is the Media, which is properly and maliciously ripped into.  Anyway, I laughed the whole way through.  Give it the Pulitzer.  Seriously.	2004-10-26
US	52164132	R1KJ46NK1X27XI	0670033448	9843603	The Inner Circle	Books	2	33	36	N	N	A great idea for a book, but not fully realized.	I bought this book the day it came out, both because I had liked \\"Drop City\\" so well, and because, hey, a book about Kinsey and sex has to be somewhat interesting.  I came away a bit disappointed.  This book lacked a real focus.  There were moments where this book seemed to make sense and actually managed to be enjoyable, but must of the time, it was rather cold and unlikable.   <br /> <br />The character of Kinsey himself (\\"Prok\\") was far too flat.  It was not clear to me what it was about him that drew his followers so deeply into his inner circle.  For the same reasons, I disliked the protagonist, John Milk.  Why he followed Kinsey so blindly at the expense of his marriage and happiness is a mystery.  The book followed him through his emotional turmoil in a cyclical fashion, with the plot rehashing itself repeatedly with no growth on the part of any characters, with the exception perhaps of Iris, Milk's wife.  But Boyle leaves her in the background, definitely a shame.   <br /> <br />The plot of this book had promise.  Kinsey was a fascinating man, and he conducted fascinating research.  But Boyle describes the research and the accompanying sexual exploits in either an illusory manner (when it is homosexual sex being discussed, or 'H-behavior') or in a way that is far too medical and sterile to be anything but uncomfortable and boring.   <br /> <br />Overall, I didn't dislike this book, I just kind of felt like I was reading to finish, instead of for the joy of the book.  It's not a bad book, it's just nota very good one.  Read \\"Drop City\\" instead to see what Boyle is really capable of.  <br />	2004-10-11

Kind of a Western version of \\"Gone With the Wind\\"...lots of local color, history, adventure, romance.  It had all of the above.  What it was missing though was writing skill and meaningful character development.   <br /> <br />McMurtry is a straightforward and plain writer.  So much so that I felt I could've written this book.  It almost reads like it was translated into English.  I found myself longing for a metaphor, a meandering description, anything but the choppy, overly active sentences I was reading.   <br /> <br />I also thought the characters were all rather flat, with the exception of Gus and Call.  They were therefore hard to empathize with.  All the characters seemed to bleed together...just a bunch of macho cowpokes who strangely sure do cry a lot on a cattle drive.   <br /> <br />I know that most people won't agree with this review, as the average review, for 275 reviews, is 5 stars, and it won the Pulitzer and all that jazz.  I guess I just don't get it.  Check out my other reviews to see if you agree with them before taking this one at face value.	2004-08-23

The second half, driven by character sketches, not only dragged, but also managed to irritate me.  Every single character was far too depressed, self-centered, and insecure.  Can't any of Michael Cunningham's characters just be happy, or at least not dwell on their own misery so much?  The first half of the book had one happy character, Bobby's brother.  I wish he had stuck around for the rest of the novel.   <br /> <br />\\"The Hours\\" was also a depressing and melancholy read, but the writing and story were so original that it hardly mattered.  Also, \\"The Hours\\" had a tighter focus of depression...all were women displeased with their constricted lives.  In contrast, the characters in \\"..the End of the World\\" all are so disparately miserable, a theme is hard to pin down.   <br /> <br />So why even give this book 2 stars?  Because despite the gloom, Cunningham does have an amazing talent.  He is able to write at times with such empathy that it causes the reader to examine his own live and emotions.  This fact is not as present in this book as it is in \\"The Hours\\", but it is there all the same, and manages to give this book a heartbeat, however faint.	2004-08-09
US	52164132	R1EZSAUVEJMN5A	0060919647	685832490	In Evil Hour	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Well, all great artists have to start somewhere	Let me just put it this way:  I am glad that \\"In Evil Hour\\" is not the first Garcia-Marquez novel I had read, or I might not have picked another one up.  \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" and \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" are absolute masterpieces.  I suppose that \\"In Evil Hour\\" was just practice for the young Garcia-Marquez...I believe this was his first novel, and all great artists have to start somewhere.   <br /> <br />Basically, this is a story of a South American town that is being undone by the posting of 'lampoons'.  Martial law is declared, a fact that surprises exactly no one, as they have lived under tyranny and the empty promises of democrats their entire lives.  It is a simple treatise on South American politics, and as such does manage to stand on its own, but it hardly seems that unique to me.  Perhaps it was on the date of its original publication, circa 1960.   <br /> <br />The cast of characters is too large to keep up with, and really none of the characters are even overly interesting.  While the reviewers on the back of this book called it \\"dream-like\\", I would prefer vague and nondescript.  From about page ten, the only thing I wanted to do was to not read this book anymore.  I did manage to finish, but only becuase it's an extremely short book.  <br /> <br />I give this book 2 stars, because we meet the fictional village of Macondo and Colonel Aureliano (literary legends made famous in \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\") for the first time.  And also because, hey, it is after all Gabriel Garcia-Marquez I'm reviewing here.	2004-08-09
US	52164132	R361QPTNPK99LR	0804111359	207158162	The Secret History	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Surprisingly engaging	By all rights, this book should have been boring with a capital B.  It starts out with the murder, so we know whodunit and whobitit by the end of page one.  Moreover, the murder itself isn't that interesting.  No Jeffrey Dahmer or even Ted Bundy stuff.  But somehow, I couldn't put this book down.  Tartt manages to create a whole world and atmosphere that is completely compelling; I hardly noticed the slow movement of the plot.  It is only now that I am writing this review I realize not a whole lot actually HAPPENED.   <br /> <br />The story takes place at a university in Vermont.  Five students who study ancient Greek form a tightknit group, and I won't say any more to give away the story.  The characters are not extremely well-developed, but this is a strength in the end, as it adds to the aura of mystery that shrouds the entire novel.  Despite the fact that the characters are 19, they speak in an almost Victorian manner (\\"I say, old man!\\"), wear plaid bathrobes, smoke pipes, drink Brandy out of sifters, and eat at $100 a plate restaurants.  It's gloriously abnormal without being pretentious (see: \\"The Rule of Four\\").   <br /> <br />Tartt has written an eerie, dark murder mystery nearly worthy of Edgar Allan Poe.  I'm looking forward to reading her other novel. <br /> <br />	2004-08-09
US	52164132	RQOJYR0SJKLGP	1573227978	117734468	The Beach	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Totally absorbing, but a bit trite at times.	First of all, this book is waaaaaaaaayy better than the movie with Leo in it. And the movie was okay. I read this book in two days...absolutely could not put it down. I loved the character of Richard. He was insecure enough to be real, but brave enough to be interesting. Other characters weren't as well rounded, but this is a plot-driven book, so you really won't even notice all the people are rather flat.  <br />  <br /> The theme of this book has been done over and over, usually better, in &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; and more recently &quot;Drop City&quot;, to name a few. People dissatisfied with society try to create their own utopia. You can see that this is headed nowhere good. The thing that makes this book original is that it is geared specifically towards people my age (25). the main allusions are to video games, Star Wars, &quot;Platoon.&quot; While this is all entertaining, it can be a little trite at times. Perhaps Garland doesn't give his readers enough credit...when Richard at the end mumbles &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; (Kurtz) I almost cringed.  <br />  <br /> But really, this is not a big drawback. It doesn't change the fact that I was riveted from page one. Highly recommended. (If you've travelled through Thailand, this book is all the more interesting)	2004-07-22
US	52164132	R16EZSACEUTOLD	0679753834	420678567	The Risk Pool	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Richard Russo, I love you.	&quot;The Risk Pool&quot; is just perfect Russo, although at some points it is apparent it is only his second novel...but just barely. The characters are reminiscent of &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, but the plot and emotional weight is more similar to &quot;Empire Falls,&quot; meaning this is both a seriously funny and serious book. I agree with a previous reviewer...the first half can be slow moving, but stick with it through the first 50 pages or so, and you'll start to get your just rewards.      Typical Russo, this is a story of a small New England town (Mohawk) that has seen it's best days pass by. Sam Hall is a ne'er-do-well who is trying to be a father to his son, Ned, but is constantly letting himself and his son down. &quot;The Risk Pool&quot; follows this relationship and the intertwined relationships of the other people living in Mohawk. It's hard to explain why Russo's novels are so wonderful. If you've read him before, then you know why he's just one of the best novelists America has right now, and &quot;The Risk Pool&quot; can stand on its own on the shelf beside &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Empire Falls.&quot;       If, on the other hand, you haven't had the chance to read Russo yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? This book is as good a place to start as any. NOW...GET READING!!!	2004-07-22

Bush	So maybe you agree with the title of this review, but when you get into a debate with a neo-conservative Dubya lover, you are just lacking in ammo, not because Dubya's right, but because the mainstream media just SUCKS and doesn't question (corporate) authority.  This book solves that problem!  Finally, here is a serious journalist giving us the lowdown on the &quot;Bushies&quot; and how their brand of religious conservatism has failed this country.  This is probably the best anti-Bush book I have read so far, and as you know, there are more than enough to chose from.<br />If you are a Bush fan...probably you won't like this book, but it might possibly change your mind, unlike Franken's or Moore's, and maybe Woodward's book.  <br />If you are not a Bush fan...this is fuel to your fire.

This book purports to be about a code hidden in some obscure ancient book, but its actually about a bunch of pretentious, self-absorbed Princeton students, written by pretentious, self-absorbed Princeton students.  If you care about Dod Hall and the Ivy Club, then by all means, read this book.  If however, like 99.9% of the population, you don't care about arcane Princeton trivia, skip it.  If you prefer your characters undeveloped with minimal plot, this is the book for you.  If however, you would rather read a book that's actually ABOUT something or has some characters that connect with the reader, then you will be far better served by almost any other book in the English language, even &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;, not exactly a literary masterpiece itself. <br />Seriously, this book sucks.	2004-06-22

Read other reviews to get a synopsis, but this is basically the life story of Garp, an unlikely hero.  The book is shot with dry wit that had me smiling through most of the book.  But the most powerful scenes are the tragic ones.  I don't think marital infidelity has ever been so well written about as it is in TWATG.  I actually cried on the bus while reading this book.  It's a roller coaster. <br />While Irving is a wonderful storyteller, his characters are still a little flat.  Hence my comment about him being no Richard Russo (one of my favorite authors), someone he is consistently compared to.  Still, the vibrant storyline and general oddness make this book one heck of a read. Irving's best.	2004-06-18

If you thought &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; were hard to believe, just wait till you get your hands on &quot;Deception Point.&quot;  There is no way this plot could ever happen.  But my guess is if you're picking up a Dan Brown book, you've already thrown reality out the window and are just looking for a fast-paced, smart thriller.  In this case, &quot;Deception Point&quot; will not let you down.  I read this book as a distraction, and it succeeded.  As with every other Dan Brown book, I couldn't put it down.  Cliffhanger after cliffhanger!  This book doesn't quite get as 'smart' as his others, but it's still way ahead of the competition.

US	52164132	R3C3RS86BEO6QJ	0449908097	498012847	The Temple Bombing	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Another wonderful microcosm of the Civil Rights from MFG	With \\"The Temple Bombing,\\" Melissa Fay Greene surpasses the accomplishment of \\"Praying for Sheetrock.\\"  Much like that book, \\"The Temple Bombing\\" is a microcosm of the Civil Rights Movement.  It is the story of the 1958 bombing of the Temple in Atlanta, a synagogue for Reform Jews.  Rabbi Rothschild led the Temple during turbulent years in the South, and was an outspoken advocate for the equal rights of Black Americans; furthermore, he believed it was the responsibility of the Jewish people to stand up for these rights.  Greene holds that it is this advocacy, combined with anti-semitism, that leads to the Temple becoming a victim of the synagogue bombings that were widespread in the 1950s South.  <br />The story of the bombing itself is compelling and reads like a true crime book.  It begins with the emergence of Nazi-like groups in the South, moves to the bombing and search for clues, and ends with a tense courtroom scene.  I simply could not put this book down. <br />But this is more than just the story of the Temple bombing.  Greene also tells the story of the Civil Rights Movement, and how in Atlanta it was in a very real way propelled and sustained by the example of Rabbi Rothschild.  Atlanta has a unique history of integration as it touted itself as \\"the city too busy to hate\\".  In other words, if integration was good PR, then Atlanta was going to do it.  Hence, the public outcry and huge support for Atlanta's Jewish community after the bombing, and the (relatively) peaceful integration of the Magnolia room and other Atlanta landmarks.  <br />Interspersed with this story are fascinating sidetrips.  The best of these are related to Dr. King; we get to see his Nobel prize celebration, his dinner at Rabbi Rothschild's home that is hidden from the Rabbi's neighbors for fear of ridicule, and finally his funeral.  <br />This book grabs onto the reader and doesn't let go.  It is compelling and important history; so much so, that one is willing to forgive Greene for making Rothschild more of a god than a man.	2004-06-02

That being said, this is not an easy read, but demands much of the reader.  Besides being the recounting of a fictional parricide and the ensuing courtroom drama, this is also Dostoevsky's greatest rumination on the meaning of life, the difference between good and evil, the phenomenon of human guilt, and the existence of God and the Devil.  Phew.<br />The novel begins with introduction of the three Karamazov brothers (there is one other bastard son, but he is largely in the background), Alexei, Dmitry, and Ivan.  All are unique and represent different parts of the human psyche.  Alexei is benevolent and good, Dmitry is passionate and generous, Ivan is serious and intellectual.  They all have their inner battles with God, which Dostoevsky brilliantly brings into the plot without losing the believability of the characters.  About halfway through the book, their father, Fyodor Karamazov is murdered.  Much like Dostoevsky's victim in \\"Crime and Punishment\\", Fyodor is an unsympathetic character who treated his sons horribly.  Dmitry is the immediate suspect and a trial follows.  Even though Dmitry is blamed for the murder, this novel circles around collective guilt in the eyes of God (if he exists, which is a question that clearly torments Dostoevsky). Who is responsible for the maltreatment of the Karamazov children?  Who is responsible for tolerance of Dmitry's excesses?  A rich cast of characters brings every possible aspect of personality into this debate, making this novel one of the most complete and well-rounded I have ever read. The theme of this book is the human condition...what it means to be human, to have freedom of choice, to have a moral conscience...issues that have been the subject of eternal debate, but find some of their clearest conveyence here in Dostoevsky's prose.<br />This book starts out a bit slow; Dostoevsky doesn't give the reader much of an intro before he launches into a treatise on religion and the state.  But I promise that it picks up quickly and never lets go.  Be prepared for your mind to travel to all sorts of different places.  This book is entertaining, thought provoking, literary...it's the whole package.<br />One of the finest books I have ever read or will ever hope to read.	2004-05-27
US	52164132	R38F6K3H13I5GG	0449911659	437546793	Rabbit, Run	Books	4	3	4	N	N	One of the best characters in 'recent' fiction	This book was not an easy one to get into.  It definitely starts slow, with descriptions and monologues overrunning the plot for a time.  But it doesn't take too long for the reader to fall in love with Rabbit.  <br />Rabbit is a young, married father who is unhappy with his lower middle class life and unexpectedly deserts his wife and son while on an errand.  He moves in with the town floozie and plays house while trying to figure out exactly what to do.  He is befriended by a priest who tries to set him on the right path during weekly golf rounds.  Despite his selfishness and arrogance, Rabbit manages to be immensely likable; somehow i was rooting for this adulterer and liar to succeed in the end.  This is mainly due to Updike's skills as a writer.  He doesn't paint a pretty picture of his characters or make them bastions of morality.  Instead, they are entirely human, which makes them incredibly easy to relate to.  I underlined several passages in the book as being remarkably insightful.  Updike is able to describe the human condition in three sentences when it would take three paragraphs for even the most skilled writers.  At least in this respect, Updike is very similar to my favorite American author, Richard Russo.  <br />Updike peppers his book with humor and tragedy, making &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; a bit of a roller coaster and always surprising.  His cast of characters (especially the minister's wife) are colorful and dynamic.  Appropriately, there's no great moral at the end (again: Russo), leaving the way open for the other Rabbit books, which after this great opening salvo, I can't wait to read.<br />4 stars.	2004-05-19

This book hardly seemed like it was by the same author.  The things that made \\"Middlesex\\" great (character development, humor, multiple story lines) are all conspicuously absent here.  \\"The Virgin Suicides\\" instead is dreamy and distant, with muddy, floating characters and a rather undeveloped plot.  There are glimpses of a better novel at times in the book, but overall, I thought this book was just okay. <br />The main thing lacking in this book is a central, sympathetic character.  I am still not sure who anyone in the book actually was...why did the girls commit suicide?  why were they so fascinating?  i have little more than an inkling after reading the whole book.<br />Perhaps if I had read this before \\"Middlesex\\" I would be more impressed.	2004-05-17

The language is choppy and void of emotion.  As this book is popular in China, and Yu Hua is revered as one of China's finest modern, popular writers, I am guessing that the translation is just not that good.  If you can read Chinese, I would recommend reading this book in its original language, &quot;Xu Sanguan Mai Xie Ji&quot; <br />This is the story of Xu Sanguan, and his struggles to make ends meet when life deals him a blow.  Whenever he is in a need of money, he sells his blood.  There is something to say here about the dire poverty and desperation of Chinese peasants under Mao; about the HIV crisis that is threatening to develop in China; and about the selling of one's soul to make a buck.  Of these three themes, only the third is alluded to.  And in the context of 1950s-1970s China, that theme doesn't even seem to make much sense.  Instead, &quot;Chronicle of a Blood Merchant&quot; is just THERE...that's about the only way I can put it. <br />As for the translation, the language is so active and choppy that it is hard to relate to the characters.  Here is a typical passage...&quot;Each and every time he sold his blood was for you.  Every ren he made selling blood he spent on you.  You were raised on his blood...You three seem to have forgotten all about that.  Then there was the time Erle was sent to work in the countryside.  Your dad sold blood not once but twice.&quot; etc.  For such a rant, it's a tremendously unexciting, repetitive speech.  And with so much punctuation (read: period, never an exclamation point), it's hard to feel the character's emotions.  Also, while it may be a verbatim translation, the English is awkward...using slang (i.e. &quot;snot-nosed brats&quot;, &quot;kids&quot;)where proper terms would be much more appropriate makes the English just completely unnatural and stilted.  There are times where ican see a glimmer of the real Yu Hua...passages where repitition is not boring, but touching, where simplicity is not unemotional, but jarring...in other words, the Yu Hua that wrote &quot;To Live.&quot;  I am pretty sure the translator has done a disservice to Yu Hua here.<br />One merit...the book is FAST, mainly because the language is absurdly simple.  You can probably read all 250 plus pages in a few hours.  And it's an okay story, even if it does read like something I could probably write myself. <br />I'd skip this one.  Read &quot;To Live&quot; instead.	2004-05-03
US	52164132	R1CBLIMIP9I9QC	0375724834	352044771	Motherless Brooklyn	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Interesting twist on the detective novel	This book is hard to categorize.  Is it a detective novel?  A satire of the detective novel?  A literary journey through the complexities of language?  Who knows, and the book is so thoroughly entertaining that it really doesn't matter what the authors real motives are.  <br />The narrator, Lionel Essrog (a name just dying for a Tourettic tic) has Tourette's Syndrome, which makes him a wonderful and unique storyteller.  And the reader can't help but laugh out loud at his unexpected yellings and shoulder taps.  I kept expecting Lionel to become annoying or to find a cure for his tics, but Lethem gratefully keeps him true to character the entire book.  The word associations and spoonerisms that Lionel erupts with will be interesting to anyone who likes wordplay.  <br />The detective part of this novel comes in when Minna, a low status criminal, is knifed.  It's up to his gang, the Minna Men, of which Lionel is one, to figure out whodunnit.  What occurs is a tongue-in-cheek crime story that actually manages to be a pretty good mystery in the end.  <br />This is overall a pretty strange book in that it was never what I expected it to be.  Hilarious, mysterious, tragic, and touching.  How did Lethem manage to do all this in just over 300 pages?  I'll be reading another Lethem very soon....	2004-05-02

With this book, Jorge Amado left behind his more serious style of writing and adopted a lighter, 'bestseller' tone.  What a great idea!...It works perfectly in this book.  It's hard to go wrong with a book full of gambling, sex, music, and love.  <br />It's obvious that Amado is a fantastic writer from page one.  His sentences flow seamlessly, blending one description into the next; the reader is entranced for all 600 plus pages.  Despite its daunting size, this was a really fast read, and with zero lag time.  He can definitely tend towards the verbose side of things, but overall, I didn't find this to be a big detraction.<br />Besides being entertaining, this book also makes you think.  Dona Flor is torn between the corporal desires of the flesh and the purity of the soul.  I won't tell you who wins.  While this book has enough bawdiness and vulgarity to keep the men reading, it is also very appealing to women; Amado taps in perfectly to the conflicting female desire for a tender, stable man on one hand, and a passionate \\"bad boy\\" on the other.  I think Dona Flor is a character that every woman can empathize with.  <br />My only complaint is that the conclusion seemed a long time coming but then wrapped up too quickly.  It's like Amado was on a deadline for the last 50 pages.  But really, this is a minor quarrel.<br />Take this book on your summer vacation...highly readable, engrossing, and smart to boot!	2004-04-28
US	52164132	RQ9A2N7BYAQTX	0375701907	635714194	Straight Man: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Richard Russo can do no wrong	In &quot;Straight Man&quot;, Richard Russo once again has proven to me that he is one of the finest American novelists currently writing.  He is brilliant in his simplicity and consistency.  I had heard that this novel was his worst, but I would have to disagree.  It is just as wonderful as all his others.  As funny as &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and as tender as &quot;Empire Falls.&quot;  I really don't know how Russo does it.  In every book he manages to create living, breathing characters in minimal plot that keeps the reader entranced far beyond the last page.  While his writing style is extremely simple, the reader still marvels at the skill put into every sentence.<br />&quot;Straight Man&quot; is a rip on academia, which all college / graduate students will find hilarious and dead-on.  The book focuses on Hank and his struggles as English Chair at a lowly, cash-strapped University in Wrong Side of the Tracks, Pennsylvania.  When his wife leaves for the weekend, Hank manages to pretty much completely turn the town upside down inside of three days.  He manages to threaten a goose on live TV, get photographed naked in a hot tub with a TV personality, spend a night in jail, and pass a few hours trapped in the ceiling above his colleagues.  <br />Russo usually writes in third person ominiscient, which really helps him develop amazing and fully-fleshed characters.  I was a little worried when I saw &quot;Straight Man&quot; was written in first person.  I shouldn't have been.  Russo still somehow manages to give his characters depth and soul.  All in all I wasn't able to put this book down.  <br />If you haven't read Richard Russo, you are really missing out.  This guy is flat-out wonderful.	2004-04-22
US	52164132	RCBQIST6R6WXW	0312422520	961531135	Positively Fifth Street: Murderers, Cheetahs, and Binion's World Series of Poker	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Completely disjointed, but has its merits	I picked this up expecting to read an interesting social and cultural history of poker, the World Series of Poker in particular.  While I got that in part from this book, I also was treated to a bunch of other stories I wasn't interested in.  <br />McManus goes to Vegas ostensibly to cover the progress of women players in the WSOP.  He ends up spending his advance on getting into the tournament and placing fifth to everyone's surprise.  This in itself is an interesting story.  But for some reason McManus insists on offering the readers weird sidetrips.  Ten pages on Sylvia Plath, his trips to strip bars, a whole chapter on his family history.  Even as I was reading it, I was confused about what on earth his grandfather's trip to the British Isles during WWI had to do with poker.  Turns out, nothing.  McManus just likes talking.  He even gives us illustrations of his grandfather's letters written while on duty, letters in no way related to poker.  McManus also assumes we are interested in his sexual exploits and the relationship between him and his wife.  I don't know about you, but the last thing I want to know is how his wife fills out a Victoria's Secret teddy, and how hard it is for him to be \\"Good Jim\\" (his persona...he also has a \\"Bad Jim\\").  Icky.<br />The murder trial of Ted Binion is a nice sidestory, but McManus doesn't develop it enough.  It makes random appearances, often at the stretch of literary credibility.  We get to hear comparisons between poker, Ted Binion, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and the author all in one sentence.  If you are confused, you should be.  <br />All this aside, the poker story itself is interesting.  I don't know anything about poker, so found it hard to follow the lingo at times, but this wasn't a major obstacle for me.  While he's playing in the championship, McManus can be quite a good tourguide, even gonzo at times.  One only wishes he would have stuck with this storyline, and left his wife's lingerie out of it.	2004-04-14
US	52164132	R1HY9EB7R1VV9F	0385721676	264457638	Oryx and Crake	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Definitely Atwood's best	The past two books I have read by Atwood (&quot;Alias Grace&quot; and &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;) did not impress me all that much.  Really, except for &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; and &quot;The Robber Bride&quot; I hadn't found much to like in Atwood's fiction.  &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; has redeemed her completely.  It is without a doubt her best book, better even than &quot;The Handmaid's Tale.&quot;<br />There is very little that can be said about the plot since the whole book is like a detective story.  The whole point of reading it is to figure out who and where Snowman is.  But here are the basics.  The book opens with Snowman, who lives in some future time, in a world empty of all normal humans.  All that exists to his knowledge is himself and strange people he calls Crakers.  The book then flashes back to Snowman's earlier life, when he was known as Jimmy and was best friends with a boy named Crake.  Jimmy and Crake lived in a time not too dissimiliar from our own, but it is obviously still sometime in the future.  The rest of the book alternates between the two time frames, explaining in the process how Jimmy became Snowman and how the rest of the world has become extinct.  In the course of the novel, we also meet Oryx, who is an amalgam of women Jimmy obsesses over.  <br />Atwood bases her vision of the future on sound science, mainly genetic manipulation.  The world she creates runs wild with rakunks (racoon skunk mix) and the spoat/gider, a genetic splice between a spider and a goat that actually does exist in Canada for the purpose of creating a super-silk used in bullet-proof vests.   This is a picture of a society so obsessed with security and scientific advancement that it has sacrificed freedom and individual desire.   But as in all dystopic novels, Atwood takes these scenarios to their extreme conclusions and apocolyptic implications. <br />This book is one of the finest dystopic novels I have ever read.  It is more readable and less preachy than &quot;A Brave New World&quot; and less political than &quot;1984.&quot;  &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; has a little bit of everything.  I didn't expect it to be as funny as it is.  The Crakers that Snowman cohabits with are naive and know nothing of the world or the humans who used to inhabit it.  As such, Snowman creates a mythology for them, which leads to some laugh-out-loud scenes.  Jimmy/Snowman as a whole is a likeable and hilarious narrator.  The story is engrossing and I could not put it down.  The fact that it reads like a detective story makes it all the more compelling.  Overall, this is a nearly perfect read...interesting, smart, funny, and thought-provoking.  Highly recommended	2004-04-12
US	52164132	R1537M2TZP8AUE	0679764410	864803147	American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson	Books	3	9	14	N	N	Dry, but overall interesting	This book took me about four months to read.  I kept picking other books up and forgetting about this one.  So it is not addictively readable, to say the least.  In fact, it was difficult for me to read more than 15 pages at a time.  I would find my attention wandering or my mind falling asleep.  <br />Dryness and drab writing aside, the book in the end was interesting.  It is not a conventional biography.  Unlike historians such as David McCulloch, Joseph Ellis digs deep into the story and into the character of Thomas Jefferson.  It does not follow Jefferson from birth to death, chronicling life events.  Instead, Ellis picks seminal points of Jefferson's life: his move to Paris, the Constitutional Convention, his stint as President, and his retirement to Monticello, and then examines Jefferson's attitudes, actions, and writings from these time periods to create a picture of the man.  It answers the question &quot;Who was Thomas Jefferson?&quot; more thoroughly than any biography I have ever read.  <br />Ellis's Jefferson is not hugely likeable, but is very human.  Ellis certainly succeeds in knocking Jefferson fro his hallowed pedastal, but only in making him human and fully fleshed, which in the end only can do Jefferson justice.    <br />After finishing this book (finally), I feel I have a pretty clear picture of Jefferson and his legacy, which makes me feel this read was very worthwhile.	2004-04-09
US	52164132	R36TQ56D5IS7BM	0142003808	28976631	Drop City	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Tom Wolfe meets William Golding	I know they say you can't judge a book by its cover, but in this case, it's not a bad comparison.  This book is dark, funny, strange, and riveting, much like the cover photo of naked hippies lying in a night-rimmed field.  <br />This is the story of a commune in Northwestern America, and their struggle to remain relevant and true to their roots.  In an effort to escape the plastic world and the man, to live off the earth, and to escape the bad vibes that have permeated their world of peace and love, the commune moves to Alaska.  The move is naive at best and tragic at worst.  Their is little place for vegan, hedonistic idealism in a land as unforgiving as the Arctic.  It doesn't take too long into a harsh, dark winter before the utopians realize they are out of their depth.  And like in all societies, cliques and factions develop, making this book vaguely reminiscent of &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; a quite purposeful allusion on Boyle's part.  <br />When the commune moves to Alaska, they run up against the sparse local population, who have learned to survive in the wilderness, and are true people of the land.  While hostilities arise, there is also born true and enduring friendships and love, making this book not a wholly depressing read, but lending it instead heart and soul...here is the &quot;Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; comparison.  One can almost hear Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters in the locals' reaction to the day-glo bus the hippies ride up in.  <br />In &quot;Drop City&quot;, Boyle has created more than an engrossing read.  It is a parable of human nature: a very real desire and achievement for peace and love counterbalanced by the predilection towards violence and revenge, naivete vs. world-weariness.  <br />All the remarks on the cover of the book called &quot;Drop City&quot; a funny novel.  I am not so sure the writing was funny as was the whole ridiculousness of the situations the characters find themselves in.  It is a tribute to Boyle's writing that the seriousness of the story does not subtract from the overall humor of the story and vice versa.  Boyle can take the reader from laughter to disgust in the length of one sentence, making this book an all over rather sober and thought-provoking read.  Highly recommended	2004-04-09
US	52164132	RFWN6P8YA6QZQ	0140132708	903668876	Midnight's Children	Books	5	7	8	N	N	WOW	If I wasn't completely convinced before that Salman Rushdie has a claim to be the most gifted writer on the planet, I am after reading this book.  <br />This novel is a generational saga along the lines of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" and Jeffrey Eugenides's \\"Middlesex\\".  As those two novels reflect the history of their own respective nations, so does \\"Midnight's Children.\\"  It is the story of one family, and one person in particular, Saleem, who is born on the stroke of midnight on the exact day and time India achieved its independence from Britain.  From that propitious birth onward, Saleem's life becomes a reflection and representation of the young Indian nation itself.  <br />The title refers to the 400 odd children who were born at or near this same midnight.  Each one of them have magical skills which vary in strength and importance in direct relation to their birth's proximity to midnight.  Since Saleem was born exactly at midnight, he has the most valuable skill, the skill to look into people's hearts, minds, and souls, and to commune with the other midnight children mentally.  In this vein, he forms the Midnight Children's Conference, a meeting of these 400+ children who communicate through Saleem's telepathic mind and have the stated goal of reforming India.  If this sounds unbelievable, it is not.  It is the same sort of magical realism fans of Latin American authors will be familiar with, and adds to the strength, beauty, and ultimate brutality of the story without making the reader roll his eyes in incredulity.  <br />As is India, so is Saleem.  He hears the multitudinous voices of India in his head, a mess of contradictions:  peace and violence, forgiveness and revenge, progress and tradition.  His family also reflects the indefinable character of India.  They are by turns real and fantastical, living and dying, perservering and escaping.  The amalgam of these voices and Saleem's family is an India that Rushdie seems to understand no better than anyone else, but his affection for and frustration with India could only come from a native.  <br />The reader also follows Saleem's physical life.  His face mirrors a map of India, and his enormous nose is gifted at sensing emotions.  From the life of a rich boy in Bombay, to a fighter in the India-Pakistan War, to a broken carnival traveller, and finally to an owner of a pickle company, Saleem's journey through life is expansive, human, and always entertaining.  The side characters are just as engrossing, and all have a part to play in the tumolt of Indian history. <br />To keep the earlier analogy going, I found this to be a slightly more difficult read than \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" but just as entertaining as \\"Middlesex\\".  Rushdie writes with wit, style, anger, and absolute brilliance.  He is generous with allusions, but I felt they were also extremely accessible.  I recommend this book not only to India-philes, but also to fans of literature in general.  This is a master in peak and rare form, and this is one of the finest novels written in a generation.  Most highly recommended.	2004-03-31

While this book is not as smart as DaVinci code, it is more action-packed...a real thriller instead of a brainy tour-de-force.  <br />The main thing that disappointed me about this book was that I was consistenly one step ahead of Robert Langdon, while in &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; he was always figuring out the codes and puzzles long before I did.  But in this book, it is not Langdon's job to be brainy, he is instead more of an action star, an unlikely Jack Ryan.  <br />If you thought &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; stretched the limits of reality (which it did, but at zero detriment to the finished project), then you're going to be in complete disbelief of &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;.  The story is totally implausible.  But really, who cares?  The action is fast-paced, the history lessons intriguing...a totally enjoyable read that will have me reading another Dan Brown book before too long.	2004-03-15

And this was a much better experience than my first Patricia Cornwell book.  While Patricia Cornwell does forensic mysteries, this one is an old-school whodunit.  The characters were well written, and the plot believable.  Best of all, unlike Cornwell, I didn't figure out the culprit before the Edward X. Delaney did.  And that, my friends, is the mark of a good crime novel.  <br />So a famous New York artist is murdered, and everybody has a motive, opportunity, and will.  There is not too much action, it is basically just a story of a detective on the hunt.  But it was hard for me to put down, all the same.<br />One amusing sidenote.  This book was obviously written pre-women's lib.  The only women are dutiful wives who relish their role.  When Delaney makes a comment about how his alcoholic partner goes home to leftovers, his wife immediately sets up a blinddate with her friend...every man needs a warm meal from a sacrificing woman, even alcoholics!  Anyway, this was not annoying, just funny.  I doubt Sanders would attract too much of a female audience with characters like that these days.  <br />Good read.	2004-03-11

I know that I wanted to like it, having adored &quot;The Shipping News&quot; and liking &quot;That Old Ace in the Hole&quot; rather well.  But the only thing I feel about this book is ambivalence.  Not good, not bad...just nothing.  <br />The plot itself is anything but riveting.  It follows random characters through their different American journeys, all ending in tragedy, death, debt, or just plain boredom.  I see what Proulx is trying to say here about the American experience, but it seems to me it's been done better by others, Richard Russo being the first to come to mind.  <br />One annoying habit (actually two annoying habits) Proulx has is one: not identifying the speaker.  After two pages of &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; the reader may finally realize who the story is about.  Other times, the chapter may end without any name, and utter confusion.  Two:  Every ten chapters or thereabouts Proulx has a &quot;What I See&quot; chapter, which is exactly what it sounds like.  Things the characters see.  This is a chance for Proulx to show off her marvelous description skills, but it can also be tedious.  Especially when most of the rest of the book is description.  <br />If you are looking to get to know Annie Proulx, this is not the book to start off on.  Read &quot;The Shipping News&quot; or &quot;That Old Ace in the Hole&quot; first; both leave definite impressions and have better developed stories and characters.  This book is...well, it's just THERE.	2004-03-11

I'll admit, I didn't read &quot;The Virgin Suicides,&quot; but I saw the movie, and found it pretentious, so I translated this trait onto the author, Jeffrey Eugenides.  I owe him an apology for jumping to that conclusion.  This book is accessible, funny, smart, sad...it's just a great, great novel, and a fabulously entertaining read.  <br />From page one I could not put this book down.  I won't give away any of the plotline, but this is the story of a hermaprodite and the disturbing (but equal parts touching and human)family history that made her the way she is.  Eugenides begins the story with Calliope, our hermaphroditic narrator, tracing a mutant gene back two generations to the Stephanides, a Greek family, emigrating from Turkey to escape the Turks.  The family moves to Detroit, Michigan, and starts a new life.  They raise a family, live through the race riots, and join the white flight to Grosse Pointe.  It is their that second generation Greek-Americans Calliope and Chapter Eleven grow up.  <br />Like the genetic mutation that haunts Calliope, Greece follows the family and story to America.  It is a promise to the Greek Church that saves Milton in World War II; it is a Greek-named hot dog that saves the Stephanides family; it is the fires of the Turkish invasion that replays itself in the Detroit race riots; and it is a Greek myth that Calliope's life parallels.  The reader is struck by the simplicity of the story-telling, and at the same time the complexity of the story.  Eugenides is truly a marvel. <br />Calliope is the best narrator I can think of in recent American literature.  Vernon Little (&quot;Vernon God Little&quot;) pales in comparison.  Calliope is human, empathetic, hilarious, and brilliant, making this book a whirlwind of all these different characteristics.  I laughed out loud several times, and yet when Calliope discovers that she is not truly a girl, it is one of the most touching and heart-rending passages I have read in years.  I read that page three times, and was moved every single time. <br />I hope that this conveys just how excellent this book is.  I only wish I had read it sooner.  I give it the highest recommendation.	2004-02-28

First, Dr. Scarpetta, our heroine, is kinda dull.  She's prudish, unfriendly, and lonely.  But I guess all of this makes her human, though not much fun to read about. Second, I solved the case before she did.  So the ending wasn't a surprise.  <br />I liked this book well enough to read another Cornwell.

US	52164132	R20A5KUANBFHLB	1400041341	205915316	Living to Tell the Tale	Books	5	6	7	N	N	One of the few honest autobios out there right now	This book took me about 3 months to read.  For me, that is a LONG time.  Like &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; this book is difficult, but extremely enjoyable and rewarding.  To put it simply, Garcia-Marquez is one of the finest authors on the planet, and this book begins to explain the how and why of his talents, while displaying them fully in the superb writing.<br />&quot;Living to Tell the Tale&quot; takes the reader from Garcia-Marquez's birth up to his move to Switzerland in his late 20s.  The book is written in long, unbroken chapters, which makes the reader feel like they are reading a journal entry, making the book highly personal and honest.  The timeframe is often ambiguous, which means that even though this is nonfiction, Garcia-Marquez's trademark &quot;magical realism&quot; is evident.  In fact, after reading this book, I am not sure that Garcia-Marquez made up the magical events in his novels...magic happens all around him.  <br />One of the most interesting parts of this book is the insight Garcia-Marquez gives into his writing style.  For example, he states that he avoids using adverbs.  I had never noticed that before, but when I was finished reading, I was astounded by all the different ways he describes things, without ever using an -ly ending.  Equally fascinating are his recounting of events that were later described in his novels:  the shut down banana factory, the first sighting of Maconda, the two doomed lovers from &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera.&quot;  <br />I don't speak Spanish well, but it is apparent even to me that Edith Grossman is the reason Garcia-Marquez is so readable in English.  Anyone can tell this is an excellent translation. <br />I am giving this book five stars, but even as I do that, I know the next two volumes will be superior.  Here you see the beginnings of the master; in the next two volumes we will see him at work.	2004-02-14

I got that to an unwanted degree.  Reading this book was a waste of my time.  The characters are completely one-dimensional, unrealisitic, and unbelievable.  There are NO surprises, although I think the author felt she put some twists in.  I saw evereything in this story coming from page one.  On the back, one of the reviewers compares Sue Monk Kidd to Carson McCullers.  I'm not a huge McCullers fan, but Kidd comes NOWHERE CLOSE.  This book will make you dumber for having read it.	2004-02-14
US	52164132	R37NHYKIZOESMT	0609608444	517121775	The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	3	12	13	N	N	Enjoyable, but rather disconnected	So two events occur close in time and proximity to each other.  Does that necessarily make them a connected tale?  Erik Larson seems to think so, but readers of &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot; might disagree that a mass murderer living in Chicago had much to do with the story of the Chicago world fair.  In fact, after reading the intro, I was lead to believe that Larson would make clear 1.) Why the Chicago fair was perceived as the most important event since the Civil War, and 2.) what exactly the connection was between H.H. Holmes, a serial killer, and Burnham, the architect of the World's Fair.  In the end, I was left with two answers...1.) who knows? and 2.) no connection whatsoever. <br />As for point number one:  Larson stretches in his efforts to make the Chicago fair interesting reading over a century later.  For example, in the start of the book, Larson goes for shock value by stating that one of the fair's architects was on a doomed ship on April 14, 1912.  Of course, the reader can figure out quickly that that ship was the Titanic, but am I shocked?  Larson alludes to a curse, a curse that never materializes in the rest of the book. Certainly, there were some deaths, mostly natural.  But nothing even approaching strange or mysterious.  Likewise, later in the book, Larson mentions that a dancer at the fair later was a stripper for someone involved in the fair's construction.  An interesting fact, but hardly anything to end a chapter on.  Much of the book relies on &quot;coincidences&quot; like this like that are barely coincidental.<br />As for the disjointed plots:  Larson follows two stories here, and tries (unsuccessfully) to unite them into one coherent storyline.  He switches between topics every chapter...one for the murder story, and one for the story of the world fair, but honestly, I have no clue as to why they are included in the same book.  Both stories are interesting, but at the conclusion of the book I was as in the dark as to what thetwo had to do with each other as I was in the beginning.  I was looking for a connection that Larson was unable to deliver.    <br />The architecture and history of the Chicago world fair are fascinating, especially the description of the first Ferris wheel, and who doesn't like reading about a serial killer?  That's why I give it three stars...for pure entertainment value, I enjoyed this book.  So for all the harping I've done about this book's faults, if you can look past them and lower your expectations, the book is interesting and quick-paced enough to be truly enjoyable.	2004-02-04
US	52164132	R3BDM2FMVRPVUR	0374166447	82302003	The Great Fire: A Novel	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Dreamy and pensive literature	On the back cover of &quot;The Great Fire,&quot; Michael Cunningham, author of &quot;The Hours,&quot; has a blurb raving about the book.  I thought this was fitting, as Hazzard's book, stylistically speaking, is very similar to &quot;The Hours&quot;.  In this novel, Hazzard does not rely on characters or plot to absorb the reader, but instead lets the writing style speak for itself.  If you enjoy reading books such as &quot;The Hours&quot; or &quot;The English Patient&quot;, then I think you will enjoy &quot;The Great Fire&quot; very much.  <br />The plot is this:  Aldred Leith, a decorated hero of WWII is writing a book on the Asian war, and living in Japan, where he falls in love with a literary youngish girl, Helen.  Their love story is the centerpiece of the novel, although there are other varied characters that Hazzard introduces.  All of the characters are struggling to find life in the dark aftermath of war.  <br />All the characters are likeable, and all are rather poorly developed.  Instead of focusing on individual character traits, the book instead unfolds along a single theme of redemption, and the characters move along with this theme unquestioningly.  There is little conflict and little excitement.  But before you dismiss this book as too boring and too drab, Hazzard does offer something that few recent novelists have: a beautiful and entrancing writing style that will pull you along, slowly but surely.  Because of the literary nature of the book, the converstation is stilted, and it is true that the characters do not talk in a 'realistic' style, but instead in a high form of English that is hard to settle with modern society.  I felt this did not subtract from the book, but instead added to its dreamlike and pensive quality, making this a truly escapist novel.  But it is not an easy one.  Expect to spend a good amount of time reading this book, and to take a lot of rests between chapters.  <br />If you pick up this book hoping for a war novel that will rivet your attention from beginning to end, look elsewhere.  But if you are looking for a book that is worth the time it takes to invest, that will make you think, and will make you appreciate the beauty of the written word, &quot;The Great Fire&quot; will more than satisfy you.    Enjoy!	2004-01-27

A comic tragedy	All the reviews on the jacket cover of this book stated it was \\"uproarious\\", or \\"the most hilarious novel of the year\\".  I think I am missing something.  True, the sharp-tongued, foul-mouthed, Holden Caulfield wannabe narrator, Vernon, certainly has his moments of quick wit and dry humor that made me laugh outloud.  But funny lines do not a funny novel make.  This is precisely the case with this book.  Indeed, it's hard to write a funny book that circles around  a school shooting and the pursuit of an innocent young man who has been elected scapegoat.  <br />Vernon Little didn't do anything wrong.  His friend, Jesus, did, killing 16 of his classmates before turning the gun on himself.  Since Jesus isn't around to blame, Vernon takes the heat.  Despite his easily-proven innocence, he is eventually accused of murdering more than 30 people in a killing binge throughout Texas.  And here is the satire.  Vernon is condemned by a media hungry for profit at any cost.  The town where he lives is all but incorporated into a business franchise as journalists swarm into it to try and make a fast buck off the scandal....and a story of innocence is not nearly scandalous enough, and doesn't even begin to satisfy America's hunger for someone to blame.  <br />Pierre's novel is peopled with (mostly) one-dimensional, ugly, obese characters, extremely fitting for the satirical mood the novel takes.  These characters beautifully represent the isolation, loneliness, and self-righteousness of American culture today.  In Vernon's town, morals and values take a back seat to status and money.  Vernon, a 15 year old loser, is the one character who grows, shows insight, remorse, and the entire range of human emotions.  While he is a high-schooler in this book, he is much more adult than any other character, and wise beyond his years.  Having the novel take place through his eyes is not making the reader see the world in a childike manner, but instead allows the reader a birds-eye view of American society at large, rendered simple and definable by one who is exiled by that very society.  <br />I was struck by the fact that this is DBC Pierre's first novel.  He writes like someone with experience.  \\"Vernon God Little\\" is a story that American's are aware of, but never tire of hearing.  It is critical without being preachy, and literary without being boring.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-16
US	52164132	R2V8TZ5L8NWYUM	0679421475	426549876	And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank	Books	3	12	29	N	N	Interesting, but lacks momentum and depth	This book starts off extremely promising, with interesting information on Atlanta in the early 1900s, and the mood that surrounds that city when Leo Frank, a Jewish Cornell man, is arrested for the murder of Mary Phagan, a little girl who worked in his pencil factory.  Despite serious doubts as to his guilt, Leo Frank is convicted, and eventually lynched for his alleged crime.<br />There are three major ways in which I believe this book fails.  First, the author, Steve Oney, is a journalist and it shows.  He writes in far too much detail regarding insignificant facts, causing the reader's attention to wane.  Second, he tries not to take sides, which doesn't sit well when writing a book about a wrongful conviction and a lynching.  The second major fault in this book is its lack of explanation as to why Atlanta lynched a white Jewish man at the height of the Jim Crow South.<br />The beginning of this book is relatively fast paced and interesting.  However, when Frank's trial begins, Oney gives an almost word for word recount, material that might be interesting in a legal context, but it hardly makes for fascinating reading.  If I were to read this book over again, I would skip the entire trial, making this book 300 pages shorter.  Oney's journalistic background also shows itself through his focus on the media at the time.  This actually is extremely interesting and well-researched, but perhaps the book should have been called \\"Leo Frank and the Media,\\" which would have better prepared readers for its real focus.<br />By explaining the trial in such detail, it seems like Oney is trying to place the blame for Leo Frank's demise on poor legal defense and even a probability of guilt.  While Oney stays true to his goal of objectivity, this neutrality has no place in a story of wrongful conviction and lynching.  Even if Leo Frank were guilty of the crime he was convicted of, something most Southern scholars dispute, the barbarity of his punishment and circus atmosphere of his trial render objectivity meaningless and even malicious.<br />This book also lacks any sort of explanation for what might have led to Frank's lynching.  Oney hints at a pervasive anti-Semitism in the South, but only in passing.  It seems to me that any story of lynching needs to be put into context.  Oney also discusses the (at the time) recent closings of Atlanta's houses of prostitution, which caused a rise in sexual hysterics, which was taken out on the murderer and rapist of Mary Phagan, no matter who it was.  This is an interesting theory, one that I had not heard, and this book would have been well served by a discussion on this topic longer than the two pages it gets, obliquely, here.<br />Finally, I ended this book not knowing who Leo Frank or Mary Phagan were.  Indeed, the people most closely involved in the crime itself are strangers to the reader.  Instead, more information is given to the journalists and attorneys who took his case as a cause celebre.  This is well and good, but as stated earlier, the title of this book is misleading.  Something referring to the media would have been more apt.ere of his trial render objectivity meaningless and even malicious.  <br />This book also lacks any sort of explanation for what might have led to Frank's lynching.

While not great literature, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is an excellent read.  I could not put it down, and a week after finishing reading it, it is still stuck in my head. Basically, the curator of the Louvre is murdered but leaves clues before dying for a Harvard codebreaker and his granddaughter.  Code and puzzle lovers will be fascinated by this book.  The clues left lead the two characters on a search for the Holy Grail.<br />Dan Brown writes in enough twists and cliffhangers for four novels, so the novel moves at breakneck speed.  At the same time, he takes the time to explain religious history and conspiracy, something I had read about in the excellent &quot;Eve's Seed.&quot;  Anyway you look at it, this is fascinating stuff.<br />Overall...an easy, completely fun read that still delivers the smarts!	2004-01-06
US	52164132	R3O5PPBF20E813	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	4	15	19	N	N	A true original	It took me a few years to finally get around to reading this book, and now I only wished I had read it sooner.  This book contains something for everyone...sex, perversion, humor, crime, philosophy.  The story is this:  an aging European moves to America where he falls in love with an American nymphet, barely 12 years old; the book recounts their adventures and the corruption of each of them as their affair continues. <br />As Nabokov is Russian, I expected this book to be a bit more choppy since it is not written in his native language.  But the most impressive thing about \\"Lolita\\" is Nabokov's absolute mastery of the English language.  I would recommend keeping a dictionary nearby, I was constantly running into words I had never in my life heard of.  Besides his amazing vocabulary, Nabokov is also able to write in a manner that truly manages to convey the inner emotions and thoughts of his characters.  John Updike described his writing as \\"ecstatic\\"--I completely agree.  I found myself underlining passages every couple pages or so, something I rarely do.  <br />Another interesting facet of this novel is its dealing with a moral issue in a highly non-moral, non-judgmental way.  Going into a story about child molestation, clearly I was expecting a cut and dry line between good/evil, right/wrong.  However, at the end of the book I wasn't sure who was the corrupter and abuser...Humbert Humbert (old European) or Lolita...The larger theme of this novel is the clashing between old European and new American ideals, although Nabokov remains ambivalent about the 'winner.'  In \\"Lolita,\\" both are self-destructing at a furious pace.<br />My one criticism of this novel is its slow pace near the end of the book.  It was difficult for me not to skim at parts.  Also, it would be handy to know some French, I think.  I just skipped all the French phases, of which there were plenty.  <br />Overall, highly recommended; not necessarily light reading.	2004-01-06
US	52164132	R3SF7OWIIIYD7C	0679753826	601428370	Mohawk	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Classic Russo	Richard Russo is simply one of the finest American authors writing today.  I would take this a step further, and say he is one of the best, period.  What is most remarkable about Russo is his ability to use the same characters over and over again in his books, yet still manage to make the story seem fresh and new every time.  <br />This is Russo's first book, but I was hard pressed to find any skill lacking.  It is quite simply a thoroughly remarkable debut in every way.  Although lacking the humor of &quot;Nobody's Fool,&quot;  it nearly matches &quot;Empire Falls&quot; in its humanity.  As usual, this is a novel about a small town in New York and the various characters that inhabit it, including the mandatory Russo ne'er-do-well, an incompetant cop, and a beautiful ex-wife.  There isn't necessarily an overriding plot, just a bunch of interweaving stories.  There is comedy, tragedy, mystery, murder, and love, all told wonderfully through Russo's living and breathing characters.   Although not as interesting and fully fleshed as Russo's characters in other novels, they are nonetheless more well written than most characters in modern American literature.  I would categorize Russo's character work as comparable to Charles Dickens.  High praise, but deserved all the same.<br />If you are interested in starting to read Russo, this is as good a place to start as any, all his skills are on display.  However, for Russo at his absolute finest, don't stop here, but move on to &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Empire Falls.&quot;	2003-12-18

It is a quick read, written at a reading level middle schoolers could understand, but somehow manages to still be grown up.  Chevalier was very successful at evoking the Netherlands of the 17th century, I could picture myself surrounded by the canals and markets.  The characters in the book were also convincing, if rather flat at times.  This book is highly recommended to someone looking for a light and 100 percent enjoyable read, maybe on an airline flight.	2003-12-09

The main problem with this book is that I have no idea what is going on.  My best guess is the Gunslinger lives in some world that is half reality half dream.  I am thinking King was doing his fair share of hallucinogenic drugs while he was writing this book.  But here is what I THINK is going on.  Roland, the gunslinger, is in pursuit of the man in black, who can help him to find the Tower, his true goal.  Along the way, he meets Jake, a young boy who becomes his travelling companion.  And they run into various adventures, misadventures, dream-like sequences, and the reader gets to flashback to Roland's youth. <br />The main problem with this book is I have no idea when or where it is taking place.  I am hoping that this becomes clearer in the second installment, although seeing how I didn't like this one too much, it may take me a while to get to &quot;The Drawing of the Three.&quot;  I have heard that perserverance in this series pays off.  If you're looking for a quick, easy read, skip this book.  If you want to read the whole series, be prepared for a slow start.	2003-12-08
US	52164132	R39ZR94MICJE1Y	037570342X	564250926	Family Matters	Books	3	9	14	N	N	A bit disappointing, but still worthwhile	I had been waiting to read this book for months, and was excited when it came out in paperback.  &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; singlehandedly made Mistry one of my favorite authors of all time.  But I came away from this book slightly disappointed.  <br />While Mistry in &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; created vivid, wonderful, and bizarre characters a la Charles Dickens, here the characters seem one-dimensional and stilted.  There is not a lot of change and growth here, so much so that at the end of the book I was left wondering what the point of the whole novel was.  The title is a giveaway to the theme, but the characters never did live up to it.  Family, in the end, didn't matter anymore than in the beginning.  Also, the physical descriptions of the bedridden father were less than pleasing to visualize.  Sometimes they made me downright queasy.  While making the book less attractive, it did have the effect of reiterating just how difficult of a position the characters who had to take care of him were.  Still, I could have done without the gross-out factor.  Finally, I am not familiar with Indian religions, and they are gone into in some detail in this book, which made me quite confused.  A basic grasp of some Indian terms would be extremely useful here.  <br />There were parts of this book that made it worth while.  Mistry is at his best when he writes about tragedy, and this book certainly has its share.  There are some memorable characters, I only wish they would have been developed more thoroughly.  But the book still lacks the raw emotion so evident in &quot;A Fine Balance.&quot;  <br />Bottom Line:  If you are looking to read Mistry, read &quot;A Fine Balance.&quot;  While &quot;Family Matters&quot; will satisfy Mistry fans, I doubt it will succeed in creating new ones.	2003-12-04

I never held any fast food company up to very high standards, but I was still shocked by what I read in this book.  Schlosser shows that fast food problems extend far beyond the quality and cleanliness of the food the customer eats.  The taint goes to meatpacking firms, the conglomeration of agriculture worldwide, a permanent lower class of low-skill, low-paid workers, the ghetto-ization and homogenization of world culture...or at least this is the case that Schlosser tries to make.  He is more convincing in some parts than others.  But the overall picture he provides is the same...fast food is ultimately a dangerous and immoral trend, and the solution lies with customers making smarter, more informed decisions.	2003-11-17

The story is immediately gripping...a teenager dies of a gunshot wound, and her boyfriend, who was at the scene, is tried for the murder, despite his claims that her death was the result of a suicide pact.  This book follows his trial, with flasbacks revealing the relationship between the two teens.  <br />I read this book in two days, which considering I am a graduate student, says a lot about how completely engrossing this book is.  Even though the story is pretty contrived and I had a good guess about how it would end, I could not stop reading.  It is the most compelling book I have read this year since \\"Seabiscuit.\\"  It has a little bit of everything...death, a murder trial, romance, sex...formulaic, but its a formula that works well in this context.  And Picoult pulls it off better than other writers of her genre, such as Jane Smiley.  <br />Overall, this is a great, entertaining, albeit fluffy read.  Highly recommended for travel or beach reading.  But be forewarned...once you start, you won't be able to stop until the book is done.	2003-10-25

Coelho pretty much repeats this over and over and over in this book.  At times, it can be pretty trite stuff...beware of sappy words like &quot;Personal Legend,&quot; &quot;Soul of the World,&quot; and other new-agey kind of stuff.  So all that aside, the book was short and to the point, it can be read in one sitting, which is nice, considering that there really is very little plot.  And at times Coelho does write a sentence that really does ring true to life and the choices a person makes.  I think this book would be most appropriate as a high school graduation gift.  If you're like me, 25, and pretty much not at a turning point, it will just seem trite.	2003-10-23

It had me laughing out loud almost the entire way through.  Adams has a very droll, dry sense of humor, and a great feel for the outlandish.  But I was expecting so much more from this book than merely bringing the funny.  It was on one 100 Greatest Books of the 20th Century list.  The story is OK, but nothing groundbreaking, aliens and earthlings adventuring through space.  And as for climax...this book ends so suddenly, I wasn't even sure what the whole point was.  Nothing was tied up or remedied.  Characters didn't change or evolve, more than a few questions went completely unanswered.  I guess this book is part of a series.  It's best feature...it's short, so I didn't waste much time, and now I can say I've read it, for whatever that's worth. I am sure there is some great sociological theme somewhere in this book, but I can't be bothered.  <br />3 stars for the laugh factor.	2003-10-20

When I first picked up this book, my first thought was that its topic was unnecessary...isn't the blank slate theory dead?  Pinker shows that it is not, and also shows the dangers of the blank slate as compared to a theory of innate human behavior and characteristics.  Far from being the saving grace of humans and the end of racism and other prejudices, the blank slate has been responsible for some of this centuries greatest atrocities, and continues to influence policy in this country today. <br />Pinker can be a bit arrogant...he calls other research into question continuously, but seems to think that the fact that identical twins separated at birth both comment independently on a car's handling is some sort of great indication of their basic similarities.  Other times, I felt he missed the point entirely.  For example, when discussing Southern ideas of honor, he left out the history of humiliation in the South, a more convincing explanation than the kinship of mountain families.  Also, when discussing women in the workplace, he neglects to mention that perhaps part of the paygap arises not due to women making the choice to have a family, but employers assuming they will and hiring accordingly.  This is a serious problem in Japan, a country he continuously cites in the gender chapter. Other times the reader will get tired of Pinker's seeming self-adulation.  Do I care what art shows he's seen at MIT?  Hardly. <br />Even with these small complaints, this book is worthy of all 5 stars.  Arrogance aside, I found the rest of this book fabulous and highly persuasive, at times funny, and always witty.  Pinker, along with Jared Diamond, is the best popular science writer working today.   If you haven't read his books, you are missing out on one of the great minds currently thinking.	2003-10-16

I was not disappointed.  Yu Hua tells the story of a Chinese peasant, Fugui, and his struggles beginning during the Chinese Civil War and ending sometime after the Cultural Revolution.  The horror and tragedy that Fugui and his family endures is horrific, and through it all, Fugui knows he has one goal...To Live. <br />I am not sure if it is Yu Hua's writing style or the translation, but the text can be choppy, which is both a positive and a negative.  On one hand, it allows passages, thoughts, and emotions to sneak up on you, completely surprising you.  One sentence you feel everything is okay, and the next Yu knocks the breath out of you with a blithe mention of tragedy.  On the other hand, it seems at times the Chinese should not have been translated so literally, and it can be a hindrance on the rhythm of the novel.  For example, where Chinese says &quot;kids&quot;, we would say &quot;children&quot;, and vice versa.  This happens throughout the novel enough to make it clear that this is not written in the language it is intended to be...hence the fifth star is missing. <br />Before I scare you away from this book with all the talk of tragedy, this story in the end is a hopeful and optimistic one.  Fugui's indomitable spirit carries through this theme.  <br />I also found it interesting from a political and hisotorical point of view, as the reader gets to witness, albeit peripherally, a peasants reactions to the chaos surrounding him.  <br />Highly recommended.	2003-10-10

The last thing I expected to be was entertained, but most of this book is actually very good and fun reading.  True, the other part is highly academic, but still accessible and absolutely essential to understanding the dynamics of change in authoritarian societies.  <br />Before Scott published his book, the dominant model for understanding participation in authoritarian societies did not extend far beyond institutional and client-patron models.  Scott breaks away from this mode and demonstrates how ordinary, powerless people in repressive societies can still manage to influence policies, through such actions as sabotage, foot-dragging, and gossip.  This model makes it much easier to understand, for example, how China reformed its agricultural system (although this book is about a Malaysian village, it is easily applied to most any country one wishes to study).  <br />Essential reading for political scientists and sociologists alike.  After reading this book, you will have a whole different view of how change is affected, and a more sophisticated frame of analysis.	2003-10-10

And it gives some great come-backs for the next time you're at a party and someone starts talking about the \\"liberal bias in the media.\\"  Franken tells it like it is, and I only wish that the mainstream media would have the guts to do the same.

It is really fun to read, and the whole ridiculous situation is at times hysterical.  Pi's attempts to tame the tiger provide some of the best scenes.  Martel can be a bit heavy-handed at times, but never enough so to draw away from the pure pleasure of this book.  The ending leaves more questions than it does answers.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-27
US	52164132	RCAEJXJJPAS18	0395927218	25220636	The Namesake: A Novel	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Lovely and Simple	Ever since reading \\"Interpreter of Maladies,\\" I have been waiting to hear from Jhumpa Lahiri again.  This book did not disappoint. <br />The story is simple.  An Indian couple, new to America, have two children, Gogol and Sonia.  Gogol gets his name from a Russian writer, and the unusual moniker is a perpetual embarrassment to him.  Not realizing the personal meaning behind his namesake, he changes his name to Nikhil when he enters college.  But the name does not completely leave him, as he realizes throughout the novel.  \\"The Namesake\\" is a story of an Indian-American and the identity and family conflicts that accompany that heritage.<br />Lahiri is one of the most elegant writers working today.  Her prose is remarkably simple and clear, yet manages to convey meanings and emotions with startling impact.  Her descriptions of Gogol and his father walking on Cape Cod and of Gogol and his wife eating their first anniversary dinner are some of the best scenes in this book, tersely delivered but at the same time deeply touching.  Lahiri's descriptions (\\"He feels a pleasant ache at his temples, and a sudden gratitude for the day and where it has brought him\\") are remarkably insightful, and capable of twisting a reader's heart. This is one of the few novels I have read (not for school) that I found myself highlighting passages and repeating sentences in my head throughout the day.  I hope I don't have to wait another 4 years for Lahiri's next novel.	2003-09-17

I have to admit, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around.  And it is not as good as &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot;  Still, even though it is not Steinbeck's best, it is better than most books I have read in my life (were this by any other author, it probably would have gotten five stars).  I thought the story was captivating, and I didn't want to stop reading.  I just loved the characters, even though they are a bit one-dimensional.  The book often alludes to the Bible, but don't worry about missing the hidden themes, Steinbeck lays them all out in the open.  If I have one major complaint, it would be that the ending lacked drama.  Other than that, this is Steinbeck at his near best.	2003-09-12

While I enjoyed it as a whole, there were some serious problems that prevents me from giving the book 4 or 5 stars. <br />Right at 400 pages, this book was much longer than necessary.  it takes quite a while to get to any interesting plot, and although the writing is skillful, and the reading enjoyable, I spent a lot of time wondering if this book was ever going to develop a story.  I think Smiley would have benefitted from more rigorous editing.  <br />I also found some of the characters to be underdeveloped and their actions therefore unbelievable.  Ginny's (the narrator) father at first seems to be a man who is tough but lovable, gruff but affectionate at heart.  This could not be further from the truth.  Perhaps I misread the character, but his actions were constantly surprising me.  Ty, Ginny's husband, also acts in a manner that doesn't at all fit with Smiley's characterization, by siding with her father in the family conflict. In fact, how he or any other character in this book could take the side of Ginny's father seems to me absurd, but they do.   <br />I notice from the other customer reviews I am not alone in this analysis.  I would recommend this book for vacation or travel reading, as its easy and interesting, but if you're looking for a unified and coherent novel that will have a lasting impact, skip this and pick up some Richard Russo or Ann Tyler.	2003-08-29
US	52164132	R3F8WAXI8T2DU8	0060541644	59964273	A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Provocative, but lags in parts	I was extremely skeptical about Power's ability to create a persuasive thesis in favor of intervention in cases of genocide.  Clearly, a moral case exists, and no one questions that.  But a government does not function on morals.  A government does not have friends, enemies, ideal.  A government has interests, and it works to promote those interests in whatever ways that it can.  The first couple examples of genocide in the book were cases where a humanitarian intervention to stop the killings would actually have gone against American interests (i.e. Cambodia and Iraq).  In these cases, the U.S. government had an interest in the government of the perpetrators of genocide.  But Power's thesis  really takes on flesh when she looks at cases where American interests actually coincide with the prevention and cessation of genocide. Thus, it is particularly damning that even when in cases where national interests and genocide cessation coincide, the United States still does not become involved militarily.   And it is through these case studies Power's statement become crystal clear:  The prevention and cessation of genocide in itself IS America's interests, be they geo-political, economic, idealistic, or (god-forbid) moral.   <br />If Power is surprisingly persuasive in the defense of her main thesis, she is less so in what the United States should actually do.  At times it seems like Power might agree with the United States throwing around military might occasionally to prevent the success of genocidal regimes, a tenet that is hard to swallow.  And it does seem to be military intervention that Power promotes.  When the U.S. does take steps to affect genocide policies (i.e. sanctions, embargoes, etc), Power invariable deems it a failure, which makes me wonder why she thinks other actions would guarantee success.  There is a bit of idealism that borders on naivete. <br />The biggest drawback of this book is that it seems to repeat the same tale over and over again, which Isuppose is the point, to show how the U.S. ignored genocide in Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda.  But the chapters about each region starts to read the same.  Really, I am not sure I would have gotten through the book had I not taken some long rests to break up the repitition.	2003-08-29

Which is why I know it should have been a much better book than it actually is.  Annie Proulx with \\"The Shipping News,\\" a magnificent book, proved that she is capable of much, much more. <br />One of the main problems with this book is the lack of a strong, central, and believable plot.  Basically, Bob Dollar is sent to Wooleybucket, Texas to scout sites for Global Pork Rind, an evil multinational coporation.  Why he is doing this is a mystery to me.  He falls in love with the Texas panhandle and the people there, but still somehow wants to make it into hog country, an industry that pollutes the air and water.  That aside, Bob is a hilarious character.  As far as I can tell, he never does do any work, despite his stated dream of buying land for GPR.  <br />This book is actually filled with a parade of interesting and funny (and funny-named) characters.  But since this is a novel, that is more of a liability than an asset.  I was hard-pressed to keep up with who was who.  This book should have been in the short story format.  The stories of the Dutch windmill expert making it big, the possibly-gay uncle who loves all things plastic, the first Fronk to come to Wooleybucket, and the woman in love with Ruby Loving all would have made wonderful stories, without trying to lump them into some mangled, barely-there plot.  It seemed Proulx herself wasn't comfortable with the novel format either.  The conclusion of the book attempts to tie up all the loose ends in one fell swoop and in the attempt eschews reality.<br />From any other author, I may have enjoyed this book a bit more.  But I expect more from Proulx, and so should you.	2003-08-15

Truly remarkable is the way in which Cunningham intertwines the lives of his characters, despite their separation by time and space.<br />This book doesn't have a climax necessarily, and it won't shock or scandalize.

I had no particular interest in horse-racing, but picked this book up for half price at a used bookstore, and figured &quot;Why not?&quot; Several people had recommended it to me, so it couldn't be all bad.  I completely underestimated this book.  I absolutely could not put it down!  I found myself waking up early in the morning before work to have time to read.  I took public transportation instead of my car so I could read.  I read 339 pages in two days (and I have a full time job).  <br />Hillenbrand brings the race track to life, in a way that is so engrossing, it won't matter a bit if the only thing you know about horses is that they're quadrupeds.  She offers an inside glimpse into the strange world of jockeys.  Along with the story of Seabiscuit himself is interwoven a cultural history of the times.  Particularaly fascinating is Hillenbrand's discussion of America's switch from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles.  <br />Read this book...it is history and story-telling at it finest.  One of the best books I have read in recent memory.	2003-08-11

So I'll just say that this is one of her best.  I liked it better than &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; but not quite as well as &quot;The Clocks&quot;.  This book didn't have as much suspense as that novel; there was quite a bit of lag time.  Christie's detective, Hercule Poirot, is annoying until you get used to him, which I am starting to, so first time Christie readers may like to start off with a non-Poirot novel.<br />I read Christie hoping to really unravel the mystery everytime before it is revealed.  Once again, Christie beat me to it!  Enjoy...	2003-08-06

True, the colonization of the Ibo takes place only in the last third of the book, but that is what makes this book so interesting.  Colonization did not occur in a vaccuum; it was imposed upon already existing and sophisticated cultures.  I think it is Achebe's purpose to show us a portrait of such a culture in order for us to better understand exactly what effect colonization had. <br />Achebe raises several interesting questions.  One of these is the question of an idea of universal rights and wrongs.  In traditional Ibo culture, twins were left to die at birth as they were harbingers of evil spirits.  The colonizers come and vanquish this custom in order to save innocent children.  In doing so, they upset Ibo culture.  In this case, who is right? Achebe also raises questions about the culpability of the colonizers.  In Western education today, colonization is blamed for a great deal of the present-day woes in Africa and Southeast Asia. Achebe's portrait of pre-colonial Africa is neither peaceful nor utopian.  Local tribes war against each other without the artificial divisions later imposed by the colonizers.  In this context, the modern-day conflicts in Nigeria between the Ibo, Hausa-Fulani, and the Yoruba come into clearer focus. <br />Achebe's writing style is simple and aggresive. You will be hard pressed to find a passive sentence, which makes for some choppy and dynamic literature.  I felt like it read more like a translation than a book that was originally written in English. It is a quick read, 3 days at the most should do it.  However, unless one has at least a passing interest in Africa and its cultures and histories, this book may be a bit dull.  <br /> Also recommended:  V.S. Naipaul.	2003-08-05

I myself have spent time in Taiwan and China and was often struck by how accurate Hessler's observations were.  <BR>The section on Chinese photo albums and the rather bizarre photo culture there was hilarious, as was the section on the English names Chinese people take.  I also identified with Hessler's alternate personality, his self in Chinese, Ho Wei.  Anyone who studies Chinese has this other personality...kind of dumb, illiterate, and not at all erudite or funny.  This book will make you laugh out loud, but it also has a serious side, discussing issues such as the sky-high rates of suicide among women in China, the educational atmosphere in a system tightly controlled by the CCP, and the death of Deng Xiaoping.	2003-08-04

She has had a life filled with misery and heartbreak, but still has the strength to hope for more.  When she marries a man she doesn't love and who harbors no feelings for her, her life seems destined to tragedy.  But through her letters to her sister and her relatioship with Shug, a singer, she learns to look beyond her own horizon.<br />The reader learns about Celie through her letters to God and her sister Nettie.  I have to admit, I don't usually like this format, so I put off reading this book for years.  But the letter format truly helped create a close and personal bond between the reader and Celie.  Celie is not well educated, so her writing is vernacular and phonetic, making the reading sometimes confusing, but the overall effect is one of empathy; the reader completely identifies with Walker's characters.  At the end of the book, Walker calls herself a medium, a dead-on description; the characters are not so much fictional as they are conjured. <br />Sometimes the story can be less than gripping, but Walker makes up for this with raw emotion.  While the plot may not necessarily keep the reader interested, the growth of the characters will. The Celie you know at the end of the book is not the woman introduced in the beginning.  <br />This book takes you places you don't expect.  Both physically, from the rural South to Africa and King Leopold, and spiritually, from oppression to freedom.  Walker was raised in Georgia and educated at Wellesley, so she employees themes of sex and race.  All of these converge into a beautiful portrait of hope, love, and pride that will long be remembered as one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century.	2003-08-01

It is everything a novel should be...comic, tragic, inspiring, depressing.  I am a born-again Mistry fan. <br />Originally, I was not too sure I would like a book based in India, as I am not familiar with the customs or language of that country.  Do not let that scare you away from this book.  While the story is uniquely Indian, it is also universally human. <br />The plot is basically about two tailors from the countryside who go to the city to make their fortune.  The characters they meet along the way are in turns vibrant and bizarre.  As you may have already read in other reviews, Mistry is reminiscent of Charles Dickens.  At the same time, you don't have to be a Dickens fan to enjoy this novel; there are significant differences between the two authors: For one thing, Mistry inserts more tragedy into his narrative.  This book can absolutely break your heart as you read it; the characters are so alive and personal that as they go through a personal hell, you are along for the ride every step of the way. There are scenes so strange and so well-described (such as the uncle twirling his sad niece and nephew on poles above his head to make money) that your chest hurts with empathy for the plight they find themselves in.  Before I scare you away with the tragic aspects of this book, \\"A Fine Balance\\" can also touch your heart; the simple kindnesses that people manage to convey against all odds are staggering in type, if not in scope. While ultimately pessimistic, Mistry keeps his characters honest and full enough to keep the reader having fun.  <br />Mistry also does an excellent job conveying the political turmoil India was experiencing at the time.  Indira Ghandi's government is seen bulldozing tenemant housing to improve the physical appearance of the country at the expense of the poor; bussing in homeless and indigent citizens to cheer at her rallies for a few measly bucks, in the end never received.  In such a country, it is no wonder that the characters have to fight for everything the want tooth and nail.  <br />I also read \\"Such a Long Journey\\" by Mistry and did not like it so well.  I am so glad I gave Mistry another chance; this novel more than redeems him as one of the greatest Indian authors alive.	2003-07-31

I knew Russo had some stiff competition, seeing as his novel \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is one of my favorites and somehow didn't earn him the Pulitzer.  <br />While not nearly as funny as \\"Nobody's Fool\\", \\"Empire Falls\\" manages to be a book that takes itself seriously yet avoid melodrama.  The main character, Miles Roby, is a brainy, sympathetic, sensitive, pushover.  I shouldn't have enjoyed reading about this character, but Russo has a gift that few authors curretly writing possess.  He makes all of his characters fully fleshed out beings.  The are completely three-dimensional and members of a world that (for too brief a time) fully exist in the readers' minds and hearts.  In true Russo style, the book does not so much conclude as it ends, and it leaves you wondering what will happen to these people that you've grown fond of. <br />Other characters include an in the closet priest, a catankerous, crusty old man, a pretentious body builder, a neurotic, depressed ex-wife, an ostracized, violent high school student, and a corrupt cop.  If you think these characters don't sound like someone you can 'get close to', think again.  Russo even gives the truly un-likable Jimmy Minty a sympathetic ear.  <br />The plot...well, there isn't too much of one, as is true with most of Russo's books.  It is a portrait of small-town life, which no one does better than Russo.  But it manages to be gripping, all the same.  I loved reading this book, and only wish it could have lasted longer.<br />I give this book 4.5 stars, because I still think \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is half a star better.	2003-07-31

Dray explains how otherwise model citizens could murder, in the most brutal manners imaginable, Black (usually) Americans for imagined to minor transgressions (True, doubtless some of the lynched were guilty of the crimes they were accused of....Readers will be tempted to justify mob justice this way.  Dray won't let you do this...the retribution is always excessive and driven by hate and fear, and completely devoid of anything resembling civilized justice).  Coming from the South, I have taken classes on lynching before, so the pages Dray dedicated to explaining the origins of lynching were not nearly as compelling as his historical and legal analyses.  Often one reads history books and still has trouble putting the events into context.  Not so with this book.  Dray captures the mood and hysteria of the times perfectly.  <br />Dray also does a wonderful job of showing that lynching was not merely an aberration of Southern justice inflicted on Black men.  Instead, lynching is described as a national sickness, with Black men, women, and children, White civil rights sympathizers, and Jewish people being the victims of the mob violence, both in the North and the South.  Dray shows how the international image of the United States was tarnished during a time when it was supposed to be the vangaurd of democracy, opposed to a German facism that was cruelly mimicked on its own soil.  He also pays tribute to the men and women of the NAACP and other like-minded organizations who had the gall to oppose mob murder.  The ultimate failure of any federal anti-lynching law is a startling example of how ingrained lynching was in the national (especially the Southern) psyche.  <br />This narration forced me to reexamine my own education about lynching.  Before college (I'm from Georgia), I had never heard of Leo Frank, the 1906 Atlanta race riots, or Sam Hose.  But I certainly had heard more than enough about the Salemwitch trials.  For these reasons it is required reading for Americans in general, and especially Southerners.<br />(warning:  obviously, some of this book is difficult to read, as recountings of the lynchings are appropriately graphic and monstrous)	2003-07-23

He is not a fan of the CCP.  That being said, I found his view refreshing.  There are many China apologists writing out there, and this book tries to balance the field.<br />Some complaints:  <BR>- Terrill is vague in parts.  Take this sentence for example: &quot;Historically, the centralization-devolution swings were sometimes a prelude to dynastic decline and fragmentation, but not always&quot;(pg. 180).  There are many wishy-washy sentences like that in &quot;New Chinese Empire.&quot;  Also, I am in the dark as to what 'synergy' really means in the context of international relations. A more detailed explanation would have been welcomed.<BR>- China scholars would disagree with Terrill that because China does not hold national, free elections, Chinese citizens have no say in their government (see Shi Tianjian's &quot;Political Participation in Beijing&quot;).  Elections are not the only, and not even the most effective, mode of participation.  Chinese participate in a variety of ways...refusal to attend meetings, local elections, protests against local cadres, letter writing (which Terrill dismisses offhand as 'petitioning the court'), etc. <BR>- Some of what Terrill writes contradicts what I have learned (not to say I am right; conflicting sources automatically make me wary).  For example: Terrill claims the protests following the accidental American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Serbia were coordinated by the government.  I was under the impression that the government tried its best to get Chinese to stop protesting for the sake of Sino-American harmony.  <BR>- Terrill can be overly harsh on China.  In his disussion of Sino-Japanese relations, he criticizes China for not letting World War II issues go.  To be fair, Japan never has apologized for atrocoties committed in that war, and its nations textbooks do not address the question honestly.  The fact that China alsocensors its textbooks / history does not lessen Japan's blame . Also, there were a few times I felt Terrill was a micrometer away from calling China &quot;Chicom,&quot; and he did call it a 'semi-terrorist outfit.'  This seems a bit much.<BR>- Terrill's argument seems to rely too much on emotion.  He taps into American frustrations at China's grandstanding, and finds a historical basis for it.  <BR>- Some of the accusations Terrill waves at China could be said just as equally about America, or any country for that matter.  He states China doesn't have allies, and therefore they are inconsistent and dishonest in foreign policy.  No country has allies, they have interests, and these interests change over time.  Terrill's accusation singles China out, but can be applied to every country in every time.<br />All those complaints aside, overall I liked this book.  I particularaly liked his explanation of China's claims on territory that is simply not theirs (Tibet, Xinjiang, Manchuria, etc.).  His view on Taiwan was especially appreciated.  He notes that talk about the &quot;Taiwan problem&quot; masks that there is no problem.  Taiwan is a healthy, prosperous democracy.  The problem is that China claims to own it.  Having lived in Taiwan, I can attest to the fact that the Mainland's propoganda claiming that the Taiwan issue is exacerbated by American policy is absolutely false.  I have yet to meet a Taiwanese person who thinks &quot;re&quot;unification is anywhere close to a good idea.  But I digress...<br />Okay, so in summary, this book was a good read, but read with a critical eye.	2003-07-17

Allende is the neice of Salvador Allende, so the writing can be quite personal, one of the major strengths of this book.<br />This book is compared to &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; and with just cause.  Marquez's and Allende's sentence structure is the same, lots of descriptive power packed into minimal space and breath: &quot;His old cook had left because her husband had been accidentally shot, and her only son, who was doing his military service in a village in the South, had been hanged from a post with his guts wrapped around his neck, the people's revenge for his having carried out the orders of his superiors&quot;(Allende, 395).  There are also magical elements...Clara is made immune to fear due to Nana's constant attempts to scare her out of muteness; the females communes with spirits; there is a gene for green hair in the del Valle family, etc.  Allende herself seems to refer to the similarites between her book and &quot;Solitude&quot;.  In that book, Marquez's characters all have similar names, making for a great deal of confusion.  Allende alludes: &quot;Her mother wanted to call her Clara, but her grandmother did not believe in repeating names, because it created confusion in her notebooks that bore witness to life&quot;(262).  <br />Allende's characters are also similar to Marquez's; an uncle who tinkers with science and alchemy, revolutionary children, etc.  But Allende's characters are more fully developed and change throughout the book.  They are not trapped by their own quirky descriptions.    <br />This book is always well written, at times beautifully so.  The only thing preventing me from giving it five stars is that sometimes my attention waned, and its politics could at times be heavy-handed.  But it never took long for the story to grab hold of me again.  A must-read.	2003-07-13

It's huge, perfect for a looooong trip.  For a synopsis of the book, see the other reviews.  I study Chinese history, not Japanese, so I can not claim to know all the inaccuracies in this novel, but I thought it squared very well with what I know about Tokugawa Japan.  My professor recommended it to our class, so I am guessing it is a good portrayal...<br />My main issue with the book, and the reason i don't give it five stars, is because I thought some of the characters were flat and under-developed.  Blackthorne, Lady Mariko, and Fujiko are stereotypes...the uncouth, heroic barbarian, and the patriotic, loyal Japanese.  At times it was a bit much.  The most well developed characters were Toranaga and Yabu, who are always leaving the reader guessing as to what their true motivations are.  <br />Other than that flaw (and it is a minor one overall), 'Shogun' is an addictive, action-packed read that will have you thinking about Japan long after you've turned the last page.<br />Tip:  make a list of the names of characters if you are unfamiliar with the Japanese naming system, as it can get very confusing.  A list of the Japanese terms Blackthorne learns is also helpful.	2003-07-11

The only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is its publication date...one year before the census in China.  Updated statistics would be much appreciated, and are now available to Chinese scholars.	2003-07-10

Thompson train	This is the first work by Hunter S. Thompson I have read.  Perhaps I expected too much, after reading all the rave reviews.  I found this collection disjointed, only occasionally humorous, and not at all shocking.  I'm not at all sure what the unifying theme is.  The nice thing is that since it is a collection, it can be read in bits and pieces.  I give it three stars, because there were moments of hilarity.	2003-07-10

First, the part about trained otters was cool.  Second, it made me laugh.  <br />There is one thing that I can not get over...Menzies includes all these maps (purported to be made by Chinese), and is always making statements like \\"Clearly it is the South American coast.\\" What?  It looks nothing like the South American coast!  And if they are drawn by Chinese with exceptional navigational and map-making skills, why does CHINA not even resemble China?! <br /> Oh, and even better, Menzies states that since there are Chinese products (silk, etc) in South America, then CLEARLY Chinese must have been there before Western colonization.  What?  Someone please show me where the bridge is that closes this chasm of logic, because I am stranded over here in the land of sanity.  What I heard was \\"There's silk in Argentina\\", and Menzies is off re-writing history. How did he get there?Maybe, just maybe, they were brought over AFTER trade routes were established.  Ridiculous.  But aren't you laughing?	2003-07-09

There is no one better than de Bary, and this new edition includes everything from the 1960 edition up through the Jiang Zemin era.	2003-07-03
US	52164132	RUEBVP2FCAQZ2	1590170466	939405552	China's New Rulers: The Secret Files (New York Review Books Collections)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Fascinating, and loads of explanatory power	With the State and the Party so tied up together in China, trying to figure out the roles of the NPC, the State Council, the Politburo, Standing Committees, etc is extremely difficult!  The best feature of this book is its ability to explain and clarify the role of each part of the Chinese government.  Then again, maybe the best feature is its descriptions of the inside workings of the CCP.  And then again, maybe the best feature is that after reading this book, you can read a New York Times article about Hu's possible liberal leanings, and say &quot;What the?...&quot; You'll know more than the average bear!  Warning: This book is not necessarily an easy read, and will be most useful to those who take more than a passing interest in China.	2003-07-03

It gives a good basic background on Sino-American relations.  For those looking for a more thorough treatment (but still a relatively entertaining read), or for those who have a more in-depth knowledge of China, I recommend &quot;America's Response to China&quot; by Cohen.	2003-07-01
US	52164132	R34O9KQGFYF9VM	0679753338	499546549	Nobody's Fool	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Favorite of favorites.	<br />I had seen the movie (it was entertaining) and so I didn't consider reading the book.  I prefer to read and then see the movie.  But I saw an autographed copy in Denver and bought it for my bookshelf.  On the flight home, I chose to read it rather than the Delta Skymagazine...and I was hooked! Nobody's Fool is laugh-out-loud funny...the characters are so well developed, they jump off the page!  There is no plot...it's a slice of life in a small town where real people drink, gamble, cheat, marry, divorce, but most importantly--really care about one another.   The book is immeasurably better than the movie.  I bought all of Russo's other books (love them, too), bought un-autographed copies of Nobody's Fool to share with friends and family, and bought the movie! I await Mr. Russo's visit to Atlanta to sign his new book.	2001-06-08
