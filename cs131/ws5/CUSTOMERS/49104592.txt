The African beliefs that made it with the slaves to Haiti were inter-mixed with the Native American Taino culture who lived there prior to the African slaves.<br /><br />AND let's not forget that New Orleans Voodoo is mixed with RootWork, Conjuring, some Native American Shamanism, Appalachian folks practices, Deutch Pow-Wow, Catholicism and the Gods know what else! So why not stop with all the slanderous crap by screaming that it's not real Voodoo and realize your argument holds no weight? As Louis Martinae, author of New Orleans Voodoo Tarot book and a drummer for the Rampart Street Voodoo Temple in NO, LA, said, \\"Voodoo is inclusive not exclusive\\".<br /><br />Hyatt and Black have done an excellent job with helping one to cut thru the miasma of theory to get you a lot of HOW-TO material. I personally have used the \\"Invocation to Eshu\\" on page 147 & invoked Exu Tranca-Ruas as explained on pages 152-153 as well as invoked Oshun as explained on pages 160-161 both with AWESOME results! My clients have been astounded at the level of work that this Exu has performed for them.<br /><br />Since I am a practitioner of Sorcery and a Spiritual Worker, I have many clients who I do RootWork and Conjure-Sorcery work for and often I've found that Exu Tranca-Ruas to be just the help they need to break thru blockages that are stopping up their lives.<br /><br />Go ahead and argue what you will about the origins of Hyatt and Black's material but RESULTS speak loudest!<br /><br />Voodoo-Sorcery is the realm of the Bokor the Vodu Sorcerer and NOT under the thumb of the Vodu Priesthood thus none of you have ANY right to point fingers and complain. And it doesn't matter if you're a Santero/a, Babalawo, Houngan, Manbo, whatever, you do NOT have any say about what Sorcerers do and don't do! I don't see any of you telling a RootWorker what is authentic or what isn't.<br /><br />The fact is that this system works. It just upsets many of you that the author's came out of the closet to explain material that was \\"supposed\\" to be kept hidden. Well too bad. It's now out in the open. And besides, the majority of this material is mere \\"surface knowledge\\" anyway. The real deep stuff is still hidden because one has to do the work to uncover it for themselves. Spoon fed info from your god-parents is mere surface knowledge to help get you to a level where - IF you do the work - then you will uncover the DEEPER aspects of Spirituality, Magic and Occultism.thentic or what isn't. <br /> <br />The fact is that this system works.

US	49104592	R2I32QO89JJ1CT	0738703087	502097170	2005 Wicca Almanac (Llewellyn's Witches Companion)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Some Essays Really Provoke Thought	I was asked by Boudica for her TWPT & Zodica Bistro sites to review this book. Typically I don't enjoy reviewing Wicca books & in particular Llewellyn Wicca books because there is so much redundancy in them. However with just under a nine dollar price tag, I couldn't object. After all even if I didn't like the articles, the book is still primarily an almanac with useful Moon phase data and calendars.<br /><br />Well first off it appears that most of the contributors used their real names in lieu of the the fluffy bunny names. I mean come on, \\"Flame Ravenhawk\\" is so cliche. And outside of Boudica herself, the only other contributor I had ever heard of was Elizabeth Barrette and that only because of her work with PanGaia magazine. The rest of that authors all sport seemingly impressive backgrounds.<br /><br />The choice of submissions must surely be difficult for the editor of such a book. Some of the articles such as \\"Teaching Wicca to Kids\\" & \\"Finding A Good Herbalist\\" really give you some food for thought as well as some things to take with you. If you bought the book for nothing more than these two essays, you couldn't go wrong. There is a lot of useful information in each that I think the average metaphysical teacher or practitioner seems to ignore.<br /><br />For those of us who have children, trying to introduce them into our belief systems is always a challenge what with the continual local governments sticking their noses into our lives. Then you take the herbal article and read it and it's \\"HELLO! WAKE UP CALL!\\" because the prescription of herbs and remedies is highly illegal unless you're a qualified physician!<br /><br />Some of the other articles such as the \\"Pagan Erotica\\" I found just plain silly. I'm sorry but I don't need to see a half naked fairy on the page baring her breasts acting demure. Oy vay! Talk about cliche! The article itself barely held my attention & I expected better out of the likes of Ms. Barrette. Ruby Lavendar's essay on Pagan horror fiction was quite interesting to me what with my literary interests in the horror and sci-fi/fantasy genres. Ruby's reading suggestions prompted me to pick up one of Mercedes Lackey's Diana Tregarde mysteries from a local garage sale. Thus far I've found that story quite entertaining.<br /><br />I found Flame Ravenhawk's essay on Yoga and Wicca was fairly good in so far as I practice a morning short form of Yoga as outlined by Rodney Yi. One of the other essays I truly enjoyed was Liz Barrette's article on Handicapped Pagans. Finally! Someone in the neo-Pagan community taking the views of handicapped individuals to heart. Particularly how she discusses some of the handicapped Gods and how we can embrace their myths.<br /><br />Overall I found the book's essays to be fun to read and as I said aside from a few of them being boring to me or disinteresting, the book is well worth the effort to procure for your own. The noveau patch-work style of pictures and art was too dijointing for my individual tastes but if you're a fan of that style, then you'll like the accompanying pictures. I rate this four out of five stars for completeness of information (the almanac) and thought provoking essays.r fiction was quite interesting to me what with my literary interests in the horror and sci-fi/fantasy genres.

The subject of Quantum Physics (hereafter referred to as \\"QP\\")always seems to mark a groan from someone however Bill Keith has attempted to apply it's Scientific understanding of this esoteric side of Science and Mathematics so you don't have to know math to grasp it.<br /><br />The fundamental understanding of this subject is outlined early on in the chapters. Now mind you this is NOT a hardcore text about the subject of QP rather it is how one can perceive it and assimilate it into the practice of Metaphysics - specifically in this book to Witchcraft.<br /><br />One of the things I did NOT care for was how on page 65 the author continues to promote Isaac Bonewits silly `laws' of Magic (sic). What would be fairer to say is that they are \\"Useful Beliefs of Magic\\". There is no way to prove that any of these beliefs are immutable laws as say we know the Law of Gravity can be proven to work. Nevertheless, Bill goes on to apply his understanding of QP & how it can be integrated into virtually any esoteric belief. He begins to show how 12 of these Useful Beliefs are integrated with QP on page 131 starting with \\"A Magical Universe\\".<br /><br />Within the same chapter, the author discusses some of the other Magically oriented paths such as Ceremonial Magic, Voudoun, Druidism, Shamanism, etc.  The real fun begins wth Chapter 6 called \\"The Worlds of If\\" because it is here where he begins to discuss very esoteric concepts of QP such as parallel worlds, multiple universes, the Astral plane and Remote Viewing possibilities.<br /><br />Chapter 8 is all about something from nothing. I was originally taught that according to the laws of Physics, \\"matter can neither be created nor destroyed\\" yet according to the author's comprehension of QP, this is not true. Matter aka Energy DO indeed come from nothing.<br /><br />Chapters 11 & 12 will be of use for you to understanding how YOU fit into QP. \\"Miracles Are Us\\" in chapter 11 discusses the principle component of Magic which is \\"belief\\" and chapter 12's \\"You Have the Power\\" is all about his understanding of objective reality.<br /><br />Now I was sorely disappointed with chapter 13's \\"Quantum Magic\\" as it again focuses on Useful Beliefs but caring to call them \\"Laws\\" instead. This is not a good way to foster attracting new ideas because you are pigeon holing yourself by using an absolute term such as `law'. We all know that even some laws have loopholes and thus are not truly a law but rather a belief. Karma is one of them. For many it is a useful belief but for others it is not.<br /><br />Chapter 15 is where he starts putting thought into action, theory into game plan. For most this chapter may be tedious as it is revisiting old Magical theories and fundamental Magical instructions such as relaxation, deep breathing, etc. The short section on affirmations on page 228 I found to be useful and incorporated several of these into my regular daily disciplines.<br /><br />The anecdotes Mr. Keith provides are humorous as well as insightful. I chuckled at his mention of himself back in his \\"hyperational\\" days when he would hear a neo-Pagan mention they \\"raised their vibrations\\" and he wondered if the energetic individual would suddenly burst into flames. LOL I don't care who you are, that's funny!<br /><br />All in all, with a complete index and full biblography plus copious footnotes spread throughout the book, I give it a 5 stars out of 5 due to his ability to take a tough subject and shape it so any 101 student could understand. Furthermore I found the price tag to be quite acceptable.ses the principle component of Magic which is \\"belief\\" and chapter 12's \\"You Have the Power\\" is all about his understanding of objective reality. <br /> <br />Now I was sorely disappointed with chapter 13's \\"Quantum Magic\\" as it again focuses on Useful Beliefs but caring to call them \\"Laws\\" instead.

While Trish does an excellent job with her writing talents, surely the subject matter couldn't be more benign? Is this yet another new age fare brought out to merely take up space on B&N bookshelves? You know with all the Pagan food recipes in the various occult books, you'd presume that when Joe and Mary Sixpack thumb thru a Pagan book, they'd figure we do little more than relax, visualize and eat!<br /><br />This now begs the question as to WHY there are no Ceremonial Magic culinary cookbooks out in print? Why there are no Vodu culinary cookbooks or Shamanistic culinary cookbooks? These practitioners eat too don't they? Or is this truly a superfluous subject that only Wiccans seem to have in common?<br /><br />My take is that food is a very individualistic thing. Putting together a culinary guide that covers all the recipes I'll ever want is tempting however due to personal tastes as well as spontaneous hankerings for a certain \\"something\\" makes that a bit of a dream. For instance I have your typical Pillsbury & Betty Crocker cookbooks that I've picked up from yard sales over the years plus several other books dealing with Oriental cuisines and Hispanic foods as these two latter cuisines are my favorite.<br /><br />Given the cheeky names of her subjects such as \\"Casseroles Coven-Craft\\", \\"Barbecues and Blessed Be's\\" and my personal favorite \\"Prayerful Poultry\\" (I've never seen any poultry pray), Trish tries to be serious by inserting folklore, legend and customs about how the various ingredients were used or prepared or outright shunned in various cultures.<br /><br />Some of the recipes actually do look tasty but again the tongue-in-cheek names are almost hystericaly \\"Make It Count Beans\\" reminded me of the oncoming flatulence episodes of if you're gonna pass wind, make it count even though she was speaking in terms of \\"bean counters\\". LOL<br /><br />All in all, it's a cute book at best but not one I'd take all that seriously to aid your magical practices. Though this IS a \\"kitchen witch's\\" guide still I don't know of too many Wiccan practitioners who'll be waiting until the right Moon phase before preparing Solar Goose or Self Control Cabbage.<br /><br />The book does offer an index and bibliography and at the listed price I thought it a bit too much even with the interspersed folklore that I found interesting. I give this book a solid two out of five stars merely for it's whimsical attitude of Wicca and culinary creations.but not one I'd take all that seriously to aid your magical practices.

At a stiff price, I found this book a so-so read. Again if you NEED an herbal and this is the only one on the shelf, grab it. If you already have one by either M. Grieve, Paul Beryl or Scott Cunningham, save your money and buy something else.<br /><br />My hat is off to Mr. Drew though in some parts of the book especially pages 11-13 where he discusses knowing what sorts of allergies you may have before diving into working with herbs.<br /><br />Chapter 1 is seriously redundant. Do the authors and publishers of these books really believe that their book will be the ONLY one that a newbie will pickup and have read? I find this to be an arrogant assumption on their part really as well as unnecessary filler that can help promote the appearance of `more for your money' and keep the price inflated as high as it is. In other words, how many damn primer chapters do you have to put into such a book?<br /><br />I found chapter 5 \\"Herbal Recipes and Remedies\\" to be quite dangerous because it treads very close to the border of prescription remedies again which only a qualified medical physician has the training and legal authority to prescribe. I forewarn you now that if you contemplate taking any of the herbal remedies in this book, please make absolutely certain you know what are you are doing, you know your own body's allergies AND you've shared what you plan to do with your medical physician.<br /><br />The foods outlined in Chapter 6 were somewhat interesting but hardly anything new. I believe Cunningham covered the \\"Magic of Food\\" in one of his cliched offerings. The classifications were nothing that you couldn't dig up in any other reference manual.<br /><br />Chapter 7's recipes for \\"Making Magick\\" sounded a lot like they were patterned after the Cunningham & Tarostar school of Kitchen Witchery and a quick look in the Bibliography shows that indeed they're on the reading list.<br /><br />Part of the problem I have with a series of recipes like this comes from my own training in Root-Conjure Sorcery where I was taught that these recipes are \\"generalized' and their application may or may not work. The idea is that the practitioner will need to truly learn the recipe by studying how each ingredient in the recipe works as well as how it interacts with the other ingredients as they are applied to the situation for which they were blended. Plus given the fact that problems generally arise from people (ourselves AND others) and our interpersonal interactions with one another, thus a practitioner should custom make each recipe after knowing the given set of circumstances and all parties involved. This way you will know if you need to add more or less of any one or more ingredients to help treat the situation correctly.<br /><br />Finally the last part focuses on the plants themselves. Drew follows the basic outline of both Grieve and Cunningham (minus a couple of things) to try and make a cohesive list of herbs, their folk names, Magical uses Astrological data and medical uses. The pictures of the plants really doesn't help someone like me who does not go out into the wild and grow or harvest all that many plants. I have a few things I go in the woods for but for the most part, I buy my herbs and roots from reputable dealers online.<br /><br />All in all, it's a so-so book to me. His anecdotes didn't really didn't click with me but that is purely an individual taste sort of thing. Again if you don't have an herbal reference, and can't find one of the others I mentioned, this isn't a bad book to get. I think the price would be justified IF the publisher opted for more graphic representations of the herbs in the wild & dropped the redundant chapters on the basics. I rate this 2 stars out of 5 for unoriginality and redundancy.ith a series of recipes like this comes from my own training in Root-Conjure Sorcery where I was taught that these recipes are \\"generalized' and their application may or may not work.

I have had the pleasure of knowing and conversing (thru E-mails)  with Ambrose Hawk for a few years now. He is a member of my own online discussion group as well as a continued contributor to the online site, A Mystical Grove.<br /><br />This is a little book with a good solid message. It's about helping you to open your creativity thru the use of an old technique called Scrying. In case you're wondering Scrying is another term used by the Occult community for \\"seeing that which is yet unknown\\" usually thru a device of some sort such as a pool of ink, a mirror or crystal to name a few.<br /><br />The book is chock full of ideas, tips, & hints to help you facilitate a better understanding of what Scrying is and how to use it. While not only helping you discover the future, Scrying also goes to help you learn to focus your mind. This alone is worth the time and effort it takes to learn to Scry.<br /><br />Another important aspect that is often overlooked on this very subject is the use of Scrying to help one become more creative. For instance, take a problem or challenging situation you're facing and focus your mind onto your speculum with the problem right there in front of you. Let it sit there and allow your mind a free rangeof possible alternatives. You will be surprised at what will pop up! Some of the ideas may not be useful to you at all however, many will be OR can be adapted to be useful!<br /><br />One of the best chapters in here is Chapter 6 which is about choosing your Speculum - the device used to Scry with. Ambrose discusses the various potentials using the traditional crystal ball and whether you should or not opt for glass or real crystal. He also discusses the pros and cons of a dark surfaced mirror. Then you get him later discussing using wine in a bowl as a speculum.<br /><br />He goes on to give you some of hs own lessons in exercises and how ritual interacts with the Scrying art. Plus he shares with you some subtle things like what you may see but is careful not to plant ideas in your head which is precisely the thing you DON'T want. Rather Ambrose allows you to make up your own mind.<br /><br />All in all, I found the book to be useful and insightful. It had an index and biblilography and even had a short bio about the author at the very end. The book doesn't have any redundant material other than maybe basic relaxation exercises but for the most part, it's a complete and fairly tight book on the subject. At the listed price, I felt it rated 5 out of 5 stars of a book on this particular subject. It held my attention and offered much in the way of practical applicatons. Get this one and add it to your collection but most of all, study it and DO the work!may see but is careful not to plant ideas in your head which is precisely the thing you DON'T want.

After reading this totally redundant offering, you have to ask yourself, \\"Is Ray Buckland, one of the most celebrated Wiccan authors, hurting for money?\\" This book really had a hard time keeping my interest. It's got a pretty cover and that's about it as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />This is just a shortened form of his classic big blue covered \\"Compleat Book of Witchcraft\\" adopted for a singular individual. Whoopee. Definitely NOT worth the price listed in my opinion!<br /><br />The chapters on Magic were culled from his previous works such as \\"Practical Color Magic\\" and his candle magic book. Gods Ray, with all your years of practice and your lifetime of study, can't you offer the Pagan community something more to chew on than this pathetic piece of rehashed material???<br /><br />This shows me that even big name authors lack the balls to delve deeper into the mysteries OR are too damn stingy to share anything deeper than surface knowledge that can be found anywhere else. For instance both Marian Green and Scotty Cunningham both wrote excellent books on the solitary path years ago. Fine time for Mr.Ray to jump on the bandwagon long after the fact.<br /><br />All in all, I rate this book 1 star out of a possible 5 and I'm being MORE than fair here. If I didn't respect Mr. Buckland so much, I'd be calling for him to be drawn and quartered. Save your money and spend it elsewhere. If you already bought this book, give it away to some newbie.	2005-04-16

I was truly delighted to see this compilation of the Mysteries of the Craft laid out under one cover in a very lucid and respectable manner. If you don't have this in your collection, go and obtain a copy.<br /><br />If I had to choose only THREE Wiccan books (thus far produced) that I would want to own, I would have to say \\"What Witches Do\\" by Stew Farrar is one; Dorene Valiente's \\"Witchcraft For Tomorrow\\" is the second; and finally THIS book by Raven Grimassi as the third and final choice.<br /><br />Mr. Grimassi does a fine job of culling the various Mysteries of the Craft beginning with the Roots of Witchcraft and the Principles and Beliefs. Here he tackles what are the core beliefs and roots of modern day Witchcraft. Redundant perhaps for some but to not include it in such a theoretical text would be inexcusable. While I found the \\"Sacred Wiccan Texts\\" to be something of a misnomer since much of the Craft was/is oral, still his rendition of the core elements such as the Charge of the Goddess from Farrar, to the Witch's Creed as put forth by Valiente to the Invocation of the Horned God by Sheba. Each ends with Grimassi's commentary which he offers to help Newbies and Initiates alike make better understanding for use later.<br /><br />The Wiccan Deities chaptere was well done and here again is the first time I bumped into how he shows the differences between the Stag-Horned God, the Bull-Horned God and the Goat-Horned God. This I had heard from various sources but never before pictured artistically and since I'm quite visually oriented, this definitely made an impact on me.<br /><br />The book also covers such subjects as Planes of Existence, Wiccan Rites, Magical Arts, the Celts and Their Mysteries. Women's & Men's Mysteries all the way to Living the Mysteries. Whole books could be written about each subject in great depth however for the sake of brevity, I felt that Mr. Grimassi did a splendid job glossing over each in only a few paragraphs each. Enogh to whet the young Witch's appetite for me I'd speculate.<br /><br />I was both schocked and surprised by Llewellyn spending the money to put in an index to this manual. That is something that ALL Llewellyn books sorely need. I found the index to be useful especially at times when referring to a previous subject while reading thru the manual. The bibliography is moot as it holds the redundant Wiccan authors that appear in almost all Llewellyn books on the subject.<br /><br />All in all, I found the fourteen dollars and ninety-five cent price tag to be a bit much but the publisher seems to think spending fiften dollars for a book nothing. Well for this one it's palatable. Why? Because if you wanted to do nothing but study the Greater and Lesser Mysteries of the Craft, you'd have to buy a ton of books to get what's been compiled and offered in this book. I rate this manual a solid 5 out of 5 stars. Add this one to your collection.a splendid job glossing over each in only a few paragraphs each.

The calendar is colorful with nice artwork so it's pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />Each month has a theme and is written by an individual such as January's is about doorways and is written by noted author Raven Grimassi whose works on Wicca & Stregha are popping up all over the place.<br /><br />One of the better essays in the calendar is not attached to a month but follows the calendar proper and is by Yasmne Galenorn. Here she talks about honoring the Ancestors and setting up an Ancestral Shrine, something I HIGHLY reocmmend to any Pagan. In the Neo-Pagan community, it seems the ancestors are only shown homage once per year whereas in the African diaspora, one's Ancestors are shown homage daily. My hats off to Ms. Galenorn for admitting she too honors her Ancestors in the morning and before retiring.<br /><br />And the essay on the Orisha, Yemaya as the Lady of the Oceans, was nicely done by Denise Dumars. Here she mentions how you can petition the Queen of the Oceans with a simple ritual and it looks to me like Denise did her homework.<br /><br />The calendar itself is useful to have around with the planetary data, Moon phases, and which Astrological sign the Moon is currently in all helps to facilitate your Magical practices - especially if you're observant of such things.<br /><br />All in all, I found the calendar to be terrific to add to your temple wall OR like me where I have my office. Plus at the listed price, it's a nice piece of art to hang. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.	2005-04-16
US	49104592	R32KSILYA30C0O	1580911269	876722560	The Complete Guide to Labyrinths: Tapping the Sacred Spiral for Power, Protection, Transformation, and Healing	Books	2	12	16	N	N	Trite & New Agey	Interesting subject but difficult for me to really get into. I've always had a fascination with labyrinths and mazes from way back when I read about the Graeco-Roman legend of the Minotaur. Later I met a man at a metaphysical festival who setup a labyrinth using stones and offered people to walk it while meditating. I found the experience to be quite uplifting and useful.<br /><br />One of my problems with new age books like this when the author has written over 50 books. This leads me to believe here is yet another cultural interest that they can exploit for a quick buck. Rather I prefer to read or hear about such a subject from someone who is truly passionate about the subject they're writing of. Someone who has spent years studying and working with it so I know they DO know a lot about the subject matter as well as be able to provide some insights I may have not seen before. I didn't get that impression here with Ms. Eason's offering.<br /><br />My favorite chapter hands down was four and that is about \\"Making A Labyrinth\\" as it outlines and gives you useful illustrations on creating your own backyard labyrinth. Having always wanted my very own Stonehenge but deciding that having several ton hunks of granite hauled in and put up made me give up that whole idea. Well now having a backyard labyrinth for my very own a viable substitute. In fact, I figure I could plant the medium sized stones deep enough so that they would not interfere with the mower blades but also remain visible.<br /><br />Some of the other chapters that really turned me off was the integration of \\"Angels\\" and \\"Archangels\\" into the Labryrinth concept. Like this ancient Celtic device needs Angels to work? How silly is that? Then as in all new age publications, there has to be that token cahpter on \\"healing\\" somewhere. Oy! Talk about an overdone cliche! Then you find she takes the cliche's further with the \\"Chakras & Labyrinths\\"! I felt like gagging here.<br /><br />Even the chapter on Labyrinth Rituals I found trite, inexcusable pap offered. I did think she had something with the essay on Enhancing your Psychic Powers thru a Dream Walk. I've often found Labyrinthine like mazes to be useful for Ritual Purposes though these were imagined on the Astral plane and not created physically here on our home plane. Still the uses of a Labyrinth and Dream workings is not without merit and thus the subject should be pursued in more depth. Perhaps Lucid Dreams and Labyrinths?<br /><br />All in all, the book was so-so to me. Again very hard to stay with it. I was constantly putting it down and picking it up again like it just did not hold my attention. The index is fantastic and very well done. The bibliography is seperated into subject categories but the downside is it again references those same old cliche loving authors of the New Age community.<br /><br />At the listed price, I found the book to be both pricey and lacking. I rate it 2 out of 5 stars for too much New Age hodge-podge and lack of real passion for the subject. Save your shekels and pass this one up. Wait for it to hit the used bookstore bins.rinth Rituals I found trite, inexcusable pap offered. I did think she had something with the essay on Enhancing your Psychic Powers thru a Dream Walk.

US	49104592	RZMW9WYX549R7	1561841978	878354292	Ceremonial Magic & the Power of Evocation	Books	4	123	138	N	Y	Should be titled: "My Way Is The Real Way"	This book has been causing a much needed rift among the practitioners of the Ritual Magic community that in reality is a long time coming. The premise of the book is that the Spirits listed in the old grimoires are not \\"parts of your brain\\" as the frustrated- psychologists-come-magicians would have you believe, but rather independent beings of great power and thought. Now I have sided with the latter argument for some years now maintaining that these Spirits want and need interaction with us as much as the help we want and need from them. Though I part company with the author in several places in his book. Oh and FYI, this is a book about manifesting the Spirit to VISIBLE appearance right dead in front of you!<br /><br />First off Lisiewski feels it's necessary to put that \\"Ph.D\\" right out in front there as if it's a badge to impress you with. His doctorate is in the field of physics and it is interesting that a scientific physicist practices the art of summoning demons and devils from the underworld. Another thing I disliked is his constant name dropping of his \\"teacher\\" - from his descriptions of their contact, it seems they were phone acqaintances more so than an eye-to-eye student-teacher relationship - the late Dr. Francis Israel Regardie. (If you don't know who HE is, then use a search engine and look him up!) Joe seems to find it necessary to link himself to Regardie early on probably to establish in your mind that he's got some lineage or validity behind him. Then he brings out that he was a student of the late Frater Albertus who was not only a Ritual Magician but also had a course in Alchemy that Lisiewski claims to have taken.<br /><br />Lisiewski does a fine job of explaining that the roots of real Hermetic Occultism does not belong to the Golden Dawn as so many have believed but rather to older sources which have been recently (last 50 years) revealed thru Greek papyrii. Lisiewski does his damndest to take cat-o-nine-tails to the modern New Age authors - which he doesn't name but you're sure he's talking about Poke Runyon, Don Kraig, Nelson White, Konstantinos, William Gray, Dion Fortune, etc. - for their ill conceived notion that the Spirits of the infamous grimoires are nothing more than aspects of our own subconscious minds.<br /><br />Now in all fairness, Lisiewski does mention on pages 87 & 88 where he asks if there is a psychological basis related to the Spirits from the grimoires and if by transferring this subjective basis from the mind of the practitioner to the magic triangle, ordering it to behave and then re-assimilating, is the practitioner doing some self-psycho-analyzing. Lisiewksi states \\"I don't know\\". And it appears he and Regardie (a trained psychiatrist)<br /><br />had words on more than one occasion about this very subject and that they disagreed. He goes on to say that by viewing the Spirits as objective Entities, it is from a purely pragmatic point-of-view. I agree.<br /><br />Now as a practitioner of Sorcery who has successfully practiced the art of Evocation since 1988, I take umbrance with the author on two very important issues he raises.<br /><br />First off is found in his \\"10 Axions for Success and Survival\\" - which the word \\"survival\\" I found to be little more than trite sounding. In Axiom number 9 where he admonishes you bt saying<br /><br />\\"Do not to reject the religion in which you were raised as, nor the commonsense found in what religionists call The Commandments of God. The use of these precepts is crucial in devising an effective subjective synthesis and producing a corresponding coherent, integrate subconscious belief system. It is also the one fundamental axiom every Practitioner of magic rigourously avoids, which accounts for more magical failure than is realized.\\"<br /><br />I feel his use of the word \\"reject\\" is incorrect, rather he should say \\"despise\\" as rejecting something and despising it are two totally different views and there is nothing wrong with rejecting yourchildhood belief system however it's all well and good to not despise it. In essence, don't blame the Buddha, Yahweh, Jesus, Mohammed or any other Deity for your parent's and culture's screwups. The old adage \\"Jesus save me from your followers\\" gives rise to this idea.<br /><br />The next bone of contention I have with this otherwise very worthwhile book is how the author speaks with a forked tongue. On one hand he's telling you that to get the results you want, you must follow the grimoire to the letter and he uses the Heptameron as an example because it requires the fewest amount of implements, tools, sacrifices, and etc. He makes it very clear that you cannot expect to get something for nothing and really takes the New Age Magicians to task for this aspect!<br /><br />THEN he explains how he gets the Spirit to do his bidding. In essence he fills his head with the power of \\"God\\" thru invocation and wrestles control with the Spirit itself. Why wrestle you ask? Well because he believes these Spirits are antagonistic toward him and don't really want to do anything to help him. Once control is maintained, then he charges the entity to do his bidding. The charge has to be worded almost like a court approved legal contract lest the Spirit find some loophole in it and screws him over.<br /><br />But what is Lisiewski really telling you here? Yes, that he acts like a bully and forces the Spirit to do his bidding without any hope of reward! Now if this atittude was prevalent among Paleros or Santeros in the African Traditional Religions, they'd get Jack Squat for results and abused & slapped around by the Orishas and Nganga Spirits for such insensitive greed.<br /><br />Here Lisiewski telling you that you can get something for nothing. He offers the Spirit NOTHING as compensation for helping him. Then he goes on to discuss - at boring length - his viewpoints on the dreaded \\"slingshot effect\\" and how to avoid it. This is totally unnecessary IF the practitioner asks the Spirit what sort of reward it would like for its services from the get-go. Obviously he never read the classic grimoire \\"Le Dragon Rouge\\" because in it the practitioner summons Lucifuge Rofocale & then barters/ negotiates with the Spirit for its help.<br /><br />In the latter half of the book, he takes you thru the Heptameron grimoire and discusses what you'll need and how to get ready for the event. In this he is superb. His notes are well done and his thought processes are clearly understood.<br /><br />Frustratingly there is no index and that seems to be a common trait for New Falcon publications. The Bibliography is good and concise. Over all the book is recommended if you're versed in this type of practice. I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner though. I obtained it from Amazon for sixteen dollars and ninety-five cents cover price.

US	49104592	R2OSREV3LUS5SK	080652393X	442145735	Corporate Magick: Mystical Tools for Business Success	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Completely Practical & User Friendly	Dare I say this is a practical book on Magic that *gasps* that does not devote a section to Karma??? I can hear the fluffy bunnies exploding all over the place. Be that as it may, Bob Johnson offers some fine advice in this work.<br /><br />While a couple of parts are hokey, such as the \\"Corporate Magick Cabal - a group of magicians, psychics, and experts who will be telepathically connected to the readers of this book twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to bolster spells and help with all types of magick.\\" That is mere hyperbole and a confidence booster.<br /><br />That aside, the book is well done in its own right. He offers you practical spells from various traditions such as Wicca, Santeria, Voodou, as well as Magically oriented advice using Astrology and Qabala. Frankly I don't think the author has practiced the religions of Santeria or Voodou, rather he offers cases of people from those religious beliefs and how they chose to conquer a challenge using what they knew from their faith.<br /><br />For those of you who're Magically challenged, there's a primer in chapter 2. Chapter 4 discusses talismans and the use of your everyday tools at work for Magical results. Some of his herbal knowledge in chapter 9 seems to have come from a variety of sources. Where he got Lovage to use in Sales is beyond me. Possibly the idea is to induce an agreeable personality to the prospect and thus gaining stronger rapport? However his use of Devil's Shoestring Root for employment is spot on as this is a southern Rootworker remedy.<br /><br />My favorite chapter is number 8 about the practical use of the Qabala (or \\"Kabbalah\\" as the author spells it). Typically in books dealing with this deeply mystical subject, far too often the practical aspect of it is overlooked in favor of reserving it solely for the use of Spiritual aims. That's all well and good if you're a heir to a throne or receiver of some large endowment being given to you or a trust fund baby. However for the rest of us, we gotta work and eke out a living and it's no one's business to tell us if we can make use of a Spiritual discipline for our own personal needs and wants.<br /><br />Johnson does not go into great depth in any chapter of the book. Frankly I feel he offers the right amount of theory which is just enough for a basic understanding. Then he gives you scenarios to consider and even offers up \\"case studies\\" for you to read and digest. Then of course, there's the spells and rites that make up the rest of the book. The meat of it that offers you some ideas on how to deal with difficult situations at work and out in the field.<br /><br />Nothing is really underhanded or manipulative in here so don't presume it's all about climbing the corporate ladder while stomping on toes and fingers of other climbers. Rather Johnson seems to allow the mature reader the opportunity to judge what to use and when to use it rather than giving tired old platitudes of \\"thou shouldn't...\\"<br /><br />The book includes a nice bibliography of the typical new age authors out there - ho hum. And it also offers a pretty decent index to help you find those passages that caught your eye earlier when you couldn't find your highlighter. My copy was obtained at a rate of fourteen dollars and ninety-five cents and I rate it a full 5 stars due to its overall completeness. Again it is mainly targeted for those in the world of business but you could adapt some of the spells and ideas into your own personal practice without much difficulty.est of us, we gotta work and eke out a living and it's no one's business to tell us if we can make use of a Spiritual discipline for our own personal needs and wants.<br /><br />Johnson does not go into great depth in any chapter of the book.

Why? Well first off he's innovative. At least as for what he's penned in his book and where he obtained that knowledge, I can't say for certain. He's a member of the Esoteric Order of the Golden Dawn (EOGD), the Society of Light (SOL) and Builders of the Adytum (BOTA). Thus he could have picked up varying levels of techniques from many sources and teachers and then again he may have invented much that is new.<br /><br />One thing I highly dislike about Llewellyn authors is their need to always have to go back to the beginning. Chapter two is about \\"A Brief History of Talismans\\" - brief my eye! That lasted from page 13 all the way to page 44! Ugh! Just what everyone wants to learn, history lessons from yet \\"another\\" Llewellyn book author. Then his chapter three is \\"Names of Power\\" and we get more of that until page 60! You see, if Llewellyn wasn't worried about page count, they could trim off 36 pages!<br /><br />The next chapter delves into something a little more meaty and that's \\"Neo-Pagan Talismans\\". Talk about something you just don't see everyday listed in a table of contents! And this is a terrific chapter up until Mr. Farrell get's to page 73 where he starts in with his own version of how the Gods from various pantheons line up to each of the seven major planets. Sorry folks but if you're just using it as a basis for talisman making, then fine adopt it but do NOT think that the Egyptian deity Ra equates exactly with the Greek Apollo or Norwegian Frey. This is typical new age author shoddy information giving! Each God/dess must be studied in its entirety and weighed on its own merits.<br /><br />There are aspects between these three Gods that more than likely would cause them to openly war with one another should you introduce them. So just because they share a single planetary rulership does not mean they're exactly alike. If you doubt me, then do some research on your own and learn about the Gods from other non-Occult sources.<br /><br />Chapter Five is weak because it's on \\"Angels and Talismans\\" and frankly most of the offered information here can be found most anywhere else in Ritual Magic literature.<br /><br />Chapter Six is called \\"Snaring the Power of the Planets\\" and it too is somewhat weak. He does show you how to plot the seals of the Spirits and Intelligences of the Planets on the Magic Squares that belong to each Planetary power. If you've never seen this before, you may want to read that chapter pretty heavily. The last thing in this chapter is *yawn* Planetary Hours - again found in hundreds of other books too.<br /><br />Chapters Seven and Eight are well worth your time to read. Here he gets into color and coloring thoughtforms. The section of Flashing Tablets should be read but again this information can be found in any number of other texts on Ritual Magic. Eight gets into drawing the talisman and here he really shines! He discusses shapes as well as new ideas such as layering the talisman and using the lightning bolt from the Four Worlds. Plus he offers up some traditional symbology you can make use of for your own talisman.<br /><br />Finally chapter Nine is about \\"Consecrating the Talisman\\" and it's standard Ritual Magic procedure though with a couple of fine twists to it.

It's an easy read and frankly way too basic for my taste however I'll give you my standard Pros & Cons.<br /><br />First off the cover is interesting. I like it. A Spirit is emerging thru a sigil and thus gives you an idea of what to expect inside. However don't judge a book by its cover. In typical New Age fasion, the three authors offer up a cook-book styled manual on the creation of thought-forms. The book is not easy to follow along as I would have liked it to be.<br /><br />In the Disclaimer, the authors state: \\"It is not the purpose of this book to reprint all the information that is otheriwse available to readers but to compliment, amplify and supplement other texts.\\" They go on to recommend the listings in the bibliography which include your standard New Age texts by Konstantinos, Kraig, LaVey, the Pajeons, etc., and throw in some Phil Hine and Stephen Mace for Chaos Magic and Voila! you have the gist of their text.<br /><br />So why do I label this yet another \\"New Age\\" work? Pages 27 thru 31 is all about Karma, Cause and Effect, yadda-yadda-yadda. Oy vay can we give it a rest all ready? Hunh?<br /><br />Most of the book was boring to me. Why? The writing failed to hold my interest and the depth of the subject matter just did not meet my requirements. The authors seem to cover the basics as found in the other texts they so try to not do. I had hoped in the chapter entitled \\"Feeding Time\\" that they'd have offered up some new and unique ideas on how to feed your entities. Alas my hopes were dashed. Then the chapter on Housing for the entity had a couple of ideas I thought were good but nothing really mind jolting. So what's the most interesting part of the book? In the appendices where the case studies are to be found.<br /><br />In all fairness, if you're truly new to the Occult scene and know Diddly-Squat about creating entities such as this, then this book would be an acceptable primer though there are many other resources out there that go into much greater depth than here.<br /><br />Finally the book includes a nice index and how to contact the authors themselves. The publishing company is based out of Perrysburg, Ohio and I find it ironic that I've lived here for since 1991 and haven't heard of this publisher prior to this book.<br /><br />I obtained it at sixteen dollars & ninety-five cents and since I ordered it by mail thru Amazon, shame on me if I feel the book is highly over-priced. It really could sell better for nine dollars and ninety-five cents but this new publishing house obviously wants to cash in on the current trend to sell mildly entertaining esoteric works for far more than they are worth to the intermediate or experienced practitioners ignorant enough to pay their asking price. Wait til you find it in the close-out bins at B&N or some other discount bookstore.<br /><br />I rate it two out of five stars. If you're experienced in this form of Magic, then skip this book entireook would be an acceptable primer though there are many other resources out there that go into much greater depth than here.<br /><br />Finally the book includes a nice index and how to contact the authors themselves.

If you have not read this introductory book on practical Occultism, let me tell you to run out and buy a copy NOW!<br /><br />Mikaharic is one of those unsung heroes in the Occult who has not only successfully practiced what he preaches but also has developed his own system of practical Occultism (like yours truly!;o)  Unlike a lot of the authors out there who play follow-the-follower when it comes to writing about Occultism be it Witchcraft, Vodu, Ritual Magic, etc., Mikaharic does his own researches, formulates his theory, tests his theory and then doing this over and over again after which THEN tells you what actually works.<br /><br />Born in rural Bosnia prior to WWI, Mikaharic he immigrated to the US in the late 30s and made his living practicing Occultism and passing himself off as a \\"witchdoctor\\".<br /><br />The book covers many subjects from Religious Ritual to learning Natural Magic and much in between. Ritual and Ceremonial Magic, Elemental Magic, Candle Magic, etc. However you may ho-hum the book and say \\"Been there, read that!\\" and probably you have. Yet the author gives personal anecdotes and experiences that are typically NOT found in your average \\"new age practitioners\\" book that you spent 1 ½ to 2 times the amount of money to get. (My copy retailed for only nine dollars and ninety-five cents).<br /><br />The exercises while basic in content and form offer some truly unique results if the dedicant perseveres enough. He even relates how his first teacher admonished him after he sent Mikaharic away with the command to practice the art of relaxation. After four months of diligent practice, Mikaharic went back to his teacher only to discover he had not mastered this subtle but necessary art fully. Thus he was told to not come back until he had done so. After another six months of diligent practice, he was ready to continue.<br /><br />There are other exercises sprinkled throughout the book that you can make use of after you've practiced and mastered them. Under the chapter on Deific Magic, the author discusses the forces at present in the objective universe and how many devotees of magico-religious systems learn to grow under the tutelege and guidance of such powers.<br /><br />There is a nice Bibliography and a worthwhile Index for you to use. If you know of a beginner who really wants to do it the right way, THIS is one of the better primers you'll be able to lead them too. It should be required reading in all covens, lodges and temples regardless of the path. I have recommended it to my students in my Sorcery tradition as well.

What a hard road the first half of this book was to get thru! Why is it every British Occultist of the \\"Western Mystery Tradition\\" has to bore us with their lineage whether it's back to Crowley, A.O.Spare, S. L. McGregor Mathers or as in this case, Dion Fortune? What should have tipped me off from the get-go was the fact their students of that pompous windbag Gareth Knight.<br /><br />Frankly I had hoped the book would be better than what I found it to be and that's an over-rated, pompous b-o-r-i-n-g! I hate trashing another author's book but damnit why do so many make it so easy too? Do we need yet another book that has to take a huge portion of the book to discuss Egyptian pantheons, myths, religions, etc.? Pages 29 thru 57 was somewhat tolerable but when you hit pages 59 and read thru 134 about Qabala, Judaism, Yahweh, the Torah, Menorahs, Tabernacles, you get the edgy deja vu feeling of \\"been here, read that\\".<br /><br />Even the section on the Celtic myths was way to anal-yzed for my taste. Why is it Western Esoteric Magicians seem to have to over-anal-yze every myth, symbol and detail? Perhaps they're frustrated psychologists who couldn't hack it in the university environment? I dunno but it's irritating to spend hard earned money for more of this \\"Magic-is-all-psychology-and-here's-our-take-on-the-subject\\" crapola. Nothing new here in that respect, folks.<br /><br />The book's premise is the \\"creative use of Myths coupled with the Polarity aspect of priesthood and sexuality\\". Wow. That's no secret tradition I know of. Sexuality is a large part and parcel of every religion, philosophy and creed out there since the day people became aware that procreation caused pregnancies not Spirits.<br /><br />The practical section starts off with the discussion of sexual partners working thru the myths and rites together. It's quite factual and gives you some things to consider. What the authors are trying to do with much verbosity is blend the Hermetic and Orphic pillars of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The left hand pillar (path) is the Hermetic and that is one of study and disciplined ritual whereas the right hand pillar (path) is the Orphic and is where creative drama and ecstasy is found. Either side can take you to Kether but the authors seem to want to blend both sides together while delving into rites based on myths.<br /><br />There's a complete index and full bibliography with the token names in Occultism listed. The endnotes really didn't help me much (but in all fairness I fought boredom to finish the book!) The asking price is typical Llewellyn fare at nineteen dollars and ninety-five cents. I rate it two out of five stars. Look elsewhere folks.d Orphic pillars of the Qabalistic Tree of Life.

US	49104592	R3P4QQVCOBDIDY	1567183131	956290359	Circles of Power: Ritual Magic in the Western Tradition	Books	5	26	26	N	N	Fills in Gaps	Probably Greer's best work to date. I have to say I'm a fan of Greer's even though I have disliked a couple of his other works but this book should be read and studied by those who're interested in working ritual magic. I say should be because every ceremonial magical text is generally suggested to be obtained and read by the novice if you take a look at the average website on this topic. Sadly though many of those sites don't mention this book and I'm not sure why.<br /><br />The book is from a straightforward Golden Dawn approach to the Western Mystery Tradition & ritual magic. Oh I hear the groans now but let me say that the rites are pared down to their core and stripped of all that ballyhoo traditionally associated with the G.: D.: material! That alone is worth the time to read thru this manual. Also like Kraig's<br /><br />\\"Modern Magick\\", \\"Circles of Power\\" is intended to be a manual used by the solitary practitioner though it can be adapted easily enough for group workings.<br /><br />Is there anything in here that's not covered elsewhere? Not really and yet he does touch on some interesting aspects regarding the Telesmatic Imagery techniques usually only mentioned in other works. Also he does a nice job of explaining the rituals and why they're used instead of just saying \\"practice this three times a day for the next two years\\" and leave it at that.<br /><br />One of the best things about this book is the simple language the author uses to express his views and understanding of the subject which in most cases one has to really struggle at first to get the gist of. Not so here. For instance, on page 109 under the heading of \\"Contemplation\\" Greer writes: \\"The central factor in contemplation, and the only aspect of it that can be called a 'technique' at all, is bare intention.\\" Nicely said. Now if you read Israel Regardie's book on the Golden Dawn, it's not written as simply as that. Why? The style evoked by Regardie - and sadly other ceremonial magical authors - is one of the snooty scholar. \\"Either keep up with me or give it up\\" tends to be their way of weeding out those who aren't worthy of the \\"many petaled lotus\\". For a novice student, Greer's simple language is a God-send. Had I had this book back in 1988 when I started my inquiries into Ritual Magic and G.: D.: material, I think I'd have made a lot more progress.<br /><br />One thing I wasn't happy about is the lack of detailed analysis of the Sephiroth's correspondences. For instance there's no mention of the scents listed for each sephira. So if you had only this book at your disposal, you wouldn't know that tobacco is the traditional scent used for the sephira of Geburah. I have to wonder if the author's intention was to use this book in conjunction with say Regardie's \\"Golden Dawn\\" manual.<br /><br />Another oddity offered in the book is the line drawing of the magical sword. On page 206 a trident is shown but it is referred to as a sword. Why I haven't a clue. Perhaps the company made an error in line drawings, I don't know. The trident is normally used in ritual magic and is rarely mentioned outside of the Solomonic grimoires so its inclusion here leaves a mystery to be answered by the author.<br /><br />In the chapter about Evocation under the heading of \\"Dealing With Spirits\\", the author provides some excellent advice on dealing with the Spirits. Pages 243-247 should be read several times before the novice runs off casting his circle of power to summon the Spirits of Riches and Wealth. Mind you Greer does not give you duck billed platitudes on ethics unlike some of the other authors on this subject, rather he gives you some good, solid, clear ideas to think about regarding dealing with the Spirits themselves.<br /><br />Finally I give him five stars on this effort. This is a subject that is very difficult to digest into one simplified work as this but Greer has made some strides doing so. I highly recommend this book to all who're interested in the subjects of Ritual Magic, Evocation or the Golden Dawn.d in the subjects of Ritual Magic, Evocation or the Golden Dawn.	2005-01-19

For most of you not in the know, Geomancy is a form of divination that came from the Arabic countries and was first talked about in Peter de Abano's \\"Heptameron\\" which is often attributed to Henry Cornelius Agrippa who compiled the mammoth work \\"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\\".<br /><br />Geomancy is related to the \\"Earth\\". It was traditionally used by drawing a box in the sand or loosely tilled soil with a stick. Then the diviner would focus on the question and make random stabs with the stick inside the box. Depending on if the total stabs was an even or odd number, a Geomantic figure was being created using a series of four lines of dots. And this same procedure would continue fifteen more times until a total of sixteen rows of dots had been tallied. If you think THAT's tough, then the manner in which the Geromantic characters are made will baffle you.<br /><br />The first sixteen lines were split into groups of four and thus you had the Four Mothers. Then you took the top line of dots of each Mother in order & from that you get the Four Daughters. Then you add the Daughters to get the Nephews. (Still with me?) THEN you add the Nephews to get the Right and Left Witnesses. Finally you add the Witnesses together and you got the Judge.<br /><br />Actually once you've created the dots and all the figures two or three different times, it becomes rather simple to remember how. Complicated? Yes. Easy to do? Yes with repetition. The tricky part is how you apply the Geomantic figures to the Medieval Astrology chart. This is a square chart where you take each figure and place it according to the outline in the book. This is standard procedure and it too becomes rather easy after five or six times of making a chart.<br /><br />Now you might ask, \\"Well if the Judge is the final outcome, why go to the bother of putting the figures in specific houses of the chart?\\" Because thru the use of Astrology and it's Aspects (squars, conunctions, oppositions, trines, sextiles, etc.) you can gain a LOT of useful information about the question and questioner that you may otherwise overlook.<br /><br />Actually Geomancy is a LOT easier to use and learn than the standard 78 Tarot cards! There's only sixteen standard Geomantic figures too. Plus the fact Geomancy is related to one particular element and all it governs: Earth. This includes careers, employment, physical health, home, love, real estate & land holdings, wealth, money, jewels, fame and fortune, etc. These areas are governed by the Gnomes of whom Ghob is the Elemental King.<br /><br />So why haven't people made more use of this system? Well the complexity for one thing. It's quite daunting at first but if you persevere, you'll see it's quite easily used. Unfortunately however this form of divination does take time to perform thus it does not lend itself so easily for those who'd like to use it at a Psychic Fair.<br /><br />Greer offers some tips on making the castings quicker but he really shines when he shows you how to construct a box with a lid to put in sand or loose crumbled dirt for your divination. Plus he offers you some excellent ideas for using Geomancy together with Magical workings.<br /><br />I've read almost all of the books dealing with Geomancy over the years and I have to give credit to Greer for making this book easily readable and quite usable. I rate this book five stars on a five star scale for it's treatment of a particularly confusing subject and the versatility of the subject matter for other things aside from divination. It does include a pretty decent bibliography as well as a handy index which is always helpful.he use of Astrology and it's Aspects (squars, conunctions, oppositions, trines, sextiles, etc.) you can gain a LOT of useful information about the question and questioner that you may otherwise overlook. <br /> <br />Actually Geomancy is a LOT easier to use and learn than the standard 78 Tarot cards!

US	49104592	R2KVYPJDM08QYB	0738704075	444205332	Magical Pathworking: Techniques of Active Imagination	Books	4	47	49	N	N	Insightfully Competent	While I'm not an overt fan of \\"pathworking\\", I have to say it does have its objective uses. Typically I've found pathworkings to do little on the physical or Astral planes regardless of which author is claiming otherwise. Pathworking is a fancy name given to a guided meditation. The main difference is that a pathworking is usually constructed along Qabalistic lines of thought and uses more often than not Hermetic symbols whereas a guided meditation can be a simple affair to get you to realize you snore in bed.<br /><br />From an inner psychology aspect, the usage and implementation of a well executed pathworking can help you to acknowledge misplaced feelings and to challenge your own fears and phobias. This is done by objectively linking the fear or phobia to a symbol and then learning to deal with the symbol's energy or using Alchemy to transmute it into something more constructive in your mind.<br /><br />This artform is nothing knew as Dion Fortune's crew have used pathworking as a main focus since the beginning of the 20th century. Others such as Dolores Ashcrowft-Nowicki have authored books on the subject as well and these would make good reading in addition to Farrell's book if you're of the notion to explore this time honored practice yourself.<br /><br />In all fairness I should clarify that what you experience on the inside landscape of your mind's pathworking can alter your perceptions and insights on the outside. It's just that a normal pathworking event will not alter a dignitary's way of thinking just because you imagine it so. That would involve you having to do a ritual/spell and empowering it in some way. Still if you sufficiently alter your own psyche strongly enough, you'll find plenty of changes on the outside of yourself for you to experience.<br /><br />Farrell offers a simple but fun experiment he calls \\"The Five Dollar Experiment\\" on page 21. It's a variation on his \\"Basic Visualization\\" lesson from the previous page. He's giving you advice on how to manifest $5 from an unexpected source to prove to you this works. After you've mastered this, he offers a technique taught to him by David Goddard and it is to help you from ever having to be in financial need again. Well thought of advice! One of the things I like about Farrell is that he's not ashamed to tell you that he learned a technique or idea from someone else to which he gives credit. THAT is rare in an author these days!<br /><br />Then Farrell offers you some practical advice on building your own inner kingdom. This is a terrific idea as it can be a springboard for a variety of creative ideas during your life. And these don't have to be all \\"metaphysically\\" oriented either. One can certainly use their inner kingdom to bounce ideas off of such as talking to other dignitaries or intelligent magical beasts for advice. In the new age circles, there has been the art of creating a magical laboratory where you go to shut out the world to give yourself some time to think, plan and get your creative juices flowing. Farrell gives you much the same and offers plenty of advice on creating this inner world for you to romp around in at your leisure or when you absolutely MUST have an answer.<br /><br />Another great chapter in this book that I highly recommend you read several times over is how to use your imagination to change your psyche. While it's true that's the fundamental focus of the whole book, here Farrell points out in specific detail an outline of steps on using your psyche to make majore changes in your life. He even discusses using this technique for helping someone who's been abused all their life. While not a panacea per se, this section can have life altering affects. However Farrell is wise to point out that no pathworking is completely 100% safe and especially where those involve altering your perceptual patterns to such a degree.<br /><br />All in all, I have to rate this book a four star manual. It's offering a lot even though it's coming from an ultra reserved esoteric order-ish background. Of course there's a bibliography and unfortunately no index. Thus make sure you have your highlighter and Post-It-Notes handy so you can mark those particulars that you find helpful for later finding.it's coming from an ultra reserved esoteric order-ish background.

This book is not one of those pedantic offerings but rather a well written and useful theory books that is so lacking in the Wiccan community.<br /><br />This is not a cookbook or \\"how-to\\" manual. What it is makes it all the more desirable for the budding and mid-level Wiccan practitioner to want to own and study.<br /><br />One of the things I have to give Grimassi is his due on covering the balance of the Wiccan cosmology. Most Wiccan books tend to focus solely on the divine feminine aspects and the chief reason for this is that many of the authors of Wiccan books are feminists. Thus the divine aspect of the male is either ignored (usually) OR relegated to little more than a masculine \\"escort\\" companion.<br /><br />The chapter on the \\"Witches God\\" I found useful and entertaining. For instance, I chuckled at the thought of the looks of horror on the faces of so many fluffy bunnies when they see the inverted pentagram in the pages of a Llewellyn book on the Craft! Actually Grimassi uses the symbol merely to point out the idea of the look of Hercules' ritual death position which according to Grimassi was inverted.<br /><br />When we get into Chapter Five, \\"Exploring the Inner Mysteries\\", Grimassi offers up front a skull and crossbones and how it symbolizes the \\"guardianship and power over the realm of death\\". At last, a Wiccan book that doesn't eschew the mysteries of Death! Sadly this is an aspect that is so lacking in modern Wiccan literature but is NOT neglected in Wicca's cousin the religion of Vodu where a Lord of Death is given His respect and dignity at every ceremony.<br /><br />Next the author takes us thru standing stones and sacred groves or that which we need to find peace in our workings. The idea that the stones retained all which they witnessed and that groves of trees harbored the Spirits of the Gods themselves. (Another concept that is found in other cultures.) Two other subjects covered by Grimassi are that of Summerland and Reincarnation both of which are not covered in any real depth but at least he makes an attempt to help the reader delve more into the concepts of each instead of just paying lip service to the notion as so many other Wiccan authors tend to do.<br /><br />The next two chapters were reminiscent of Stewart Farrar's \\"Eight Sabbats For Witches\\" as Grimassi tries to offer more than an overview of each sabbat and the meaning behind its importance. Not since Stew Farrar has this subject been dealt with in any real depth and due to the lack of written evidence on neo-Celtic sources, this does not help make it any easier for Grimassi to explain the spiritual significance underlying each one. I for one would like to see Raven take his time and research this area of Wiccan lore more in depth perhaps even with a book devoted solely to the spokes of the year.<br /><br />The rest of the book delves into other areas that are worthy of study for the Wiccan. One of the interesting things about Grimassi is that while I don't consider him a scholar in his research, I do consider him to be a valid reconstructionist. Why? Because some of his theories & conclusions just do not convince me when he points to historical evidence (sic). Too much of this material is skewed by minimal accounts and smacks of way too much personal interpretation.<br /><br />The bibliography is not full of other Llewellyn books and thus lends more credibility to Grimassi as a researcher for this work. This in itself is a refreshing break from your typical Llewellyn offering. One sore point though is in the section on \\"The View from Colleges and Cauldrons\\" where Grimassi quotes from one of $ilver Ravenwolf's books and he was doing so well up to that point!<br /><br />In my advanced, un-edited copy, there was no index so I'm not sure if the finalized version does indeed have an index. All in all I rate this book four stars and recommend it to anyone who wants to get a valuable overview of the mystery aspects of the Craft of the Witch..

US	49104592	RH3LACQO7JM9R	156718314X	910537234	Inside a Magical Lodge: Group Ritual in the Western Tradition	Books	5	17	17	N	N	How To Form Western Esoteric Group	Finally a decent book on forming a group in a modern, esoteric, manner. Prior to this book, there hasn't been much on the structuring of a formal magical lodge/order outside of a few Wiccan Circle types of books. The closest I've come across is the late William G. Gray's \\"Inner Temple Magic\\" and that had more to do with WHAT to do while in a magical order than it did about forming one.<br /><br />Part of the problem with such books is that little is offered as guidance on dealing with the people within such a group. The group dynamics is usually overlooked so the seeker looking to gain some knowledge running a group and not just forming one is often left to his/her own devices on dealing with people. This makes for a blind leading the blind type of situation - at least emotionally - and usually what occurs is that the rest of the group is leaderless.<br /><br />In the Satanic oriented groups, the leader is often encouraged to lead with an \\"iron fist\\" or \\"it's MY way or the highway\\" as pointed out by Rev. Yaj Nomolos in his book \\"The Magic Circle\\". Whereas in the Ritual & Ceremonial Magical traditions, the heavy handedness is not always conducive to a smooth running operation. Fortunately this book offers some simplistic thoughts on dealing with people within the lodge and mainly that is covered in Chapter 2.<br /><br />What this book does offer is pretty solid material on WHY one should want to formulate a lodge and WHAT kind of structure the group should have.<br /><br />The book starts out with pretty basic historical information on who the Freemasons were and why they came to be. This was based on the Medeival Guilds that were formed around trades and craftsmen. What follows next is the jump from the Freemasons to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and it's not like we haven't heard of that particular order before.<br /><br />Greer also points out the foundation of what a Magical Lodge really is and offers to the interested party: structure, symbolism, magic and secrecy. In chatper 2, he nails it on the head when he writes \\"A magical lodge can take many forms and be many things. If it's going to function at all, though, there's at least one thing it has to be: a group of people who are able to put together the resources of space, time, and material needed for the lodge's work and who can do so with a minimum of bickering, confusion, and hurt feelings....A group that can't manage at least this much isn't going to likely to last long or get far.\\" This fact has caused many lodges (and covens) to peter out long before they really could begin all over this very fact.<br /><br />When we get thru the next three chapters on each of the foundations of symbolism, magic and secrecy, Greer has done a pretty decent job of offering more than mere platitudes in which to live by. He has explored very real concepts such as the group's egregore which helps to keep the nucleus of the group together. Then he tackles initiation and why this should be an important step to getting into a lodge. Finally he discusses the practical uses of secrecy and how this can benefit the group's continued focus as it progresses along.<br /><br />The next part of the book covers the forming of a magical lodge. Greer uses a mythical group of personalities who opt to form their own lodge using alchemy as a framework. This is a useful teaching method and it allows Greer to give a better explanation of the various intricacies of sorting thru the mess of trying to form a core lodge group. He calls this group \\"The Order of the Athanor\\" and as we follow the formation of this group, we see some of the pitfalls and highpoints of forming and operating this group.<br /><br />One of the pitfalls of lodges has always been the monetary dues contributions from its members. This is a sore point for many would-be lodge members because of their current financial situation which most deem financially strapped. Unfortunately, unless one has an ideal temple in their home, it takes the combined efforts of an entire group contributing money to rent a hall big enough to support a group. For example, if say you or I were to invest in building a comfortable working space such as an insulated and climate controlled pole barn, there is not only the initial cost of such a building and land to worry about but also the ongoing day-to-day maintenance to deal with. Utilities and upkeep usually are a drain on one person and without the group kicking in some sort of monetary support, the person in question will more than likely come to resent the fact that she or he has to foot the bill. And if one tries to keep meetings in their home, the same sort of thing eventually happens.<br /><br />Greer also discusses some of the more esoteric rites that are available  outside of just initiation and one of them is the working of Invisibility. This subject has been covered in Greer's prior work \\"Circles of Power\\". He takes this subject and lucidly explains the concept and how to do it sort of approach that many aspiring magicians drool to be able to accomplish.<br /><br />All in all, this book is highly recommended with five stars because the author has chosen to tackle a very neglected subject and offers some very practical advice on forming a group. So much so that even Wiccans wishing to form a coven would be well to research from this book.ir home, it takes the combined efforts of an entire group contributing money to rent a hall big enough to support a group.

Lon has offered me much more now that I've read his book and have a deeper understanding of the complexities of the Thoth deck and to that I am grateful.<br /><br />Chapters Zero and One should be read a few times prior to reading the rest of the book so you are prepped for what is to come and why it's coming. Take my advice and do not overlook this step. You'll glean a LOT more from doing this simple thing than reading the rest of the book more than once.<br /><br />Chapters Two thru Seven are the obligatory history of Uncle Al and why he was who he was. Frankly this material is not necessary in my opinion as there are plenty of other sources Lon could have referenced just as easily instead of adding this filler to the book. But there are some who have this attitude that if you like their book they have to include as much history or ethical platitudes as possible to make it a \\"complete\\" work.<br /><br />Chapter Eight is very helpful if you happen to be into the Rosicrucian  oriented framework as it covers the all important Rosy Cross. Now even if you're NOT into this aspect, it helps to further understand the Qabalistic designs of Uncle Al's Thoth deck. Why? Because this aspect of Thelema is patterened after the Golden Dawn's Rose Cross symbol and is central to Thelema as well.<br /><br />I could go on and on touching on each chapter and would end up spoiling the fun of working thru this manual before you read it. So I won't however I will say you should have your Thoth deck out and at hand as you read thru each subsequent chapter on the various cards. Take your time and read each section carefully then let that information flow thru your mind and let it drift away THEN gaze and contemplate the card in your hand. If you don't gain some sort of insights by the time you're done contemplating the card, then go back and re-read that section on that card. You'll gain SOMETHING worthwhile!<br /><br />I rate this book five stars for the breadth of the subject matter. The book is complete and tight in its offering. There are some useful insights offered by DuQuette as you work your way thru the book and he even offers some quips and personal anecdotes as well. I recommend this book to those who have a strong desire to master the Thoth deck. This is not to say that by reading this book you'll have mastered the deck itself but rather will gain a useful starting point from which to begin and material to help fill in the gaps of understanding which are most surely to plague you when trying to use this deck for more than mere divination.tude that if you like their book they have to include as much history or ethical platitudes as possible to make it a \\"complete\\" work. <br /> <br />Chapter Eight is very helpful if you happen to be into the Rosicrucian  oriented framework as it covers the all important Rosy Cross.

The idea is to take you thru the five elements and give you an opportunity to both follow a system yet give you enough flexibility to allow yourself to grow at your own pace.<br /><br />One of the smallest (thankfully) sections is on the subject of ethics and frankly I think the author has heard the cry of the well seasoned practitioner to get on with the business of Witchcraft and forgo all the regurgitated arguments on how ethical a Witch needs to be. Sadly though the author does follow parrots favorite comparisons at how the ethics and belief in karma are intermarried but again it's a brief regurgitation so the bile does not rise up all that far in one's throat.<br /><br />One of the other sad parts of this book is how the author continues to pass on misinformation regarding colors and in particular the color \\"black\\". In here the author seems to jump on the karma beleaguered bandwagon with this color being `absorption'. Ugh! Why can't the author simply explain that black should be reserved for when one has to do not-nice things to someone and to use your best judgment before resorting to using it? Leave it up the discretion of the reader to make that distinction and not give out duck billed platitudes as guidelines. Frankly by watering down the color black by naming it for such useless thing as `absorbing negativity' when in fact, White is best for the transformation of such energy, the author is passing along erroneous information.<br /><br />Conversely beginning on page 157, we see the burgeoning seeker is taught the rudiments of opening their psychism in `The First Steps of Psychic Work'. I have to applaud the author on his choice of methods to introduce the neophyte into the realm of psychism. Too bad though he did not include as many exercises as I would have liked to have seen in the book<br /><br />The best thing I liked about the book is his section on Group Dynamics. Now this is a section that everyone who wants to start a study group or egads a coven should be forced to read! The section does mention that differing personalities can be conflicting within the group as well as how to deal with conflict and how to advise properly.<br /><br />All in all, I give this book a rating of three stars as it does offer some decent material that's very well worthwhile for the Novice to learn from as well as some rudimentary basics on running a group be it for discussion or working. While the index is fairly comprehensive, the Suggested Reading List suffers from the same old books mentioned in every Wicca 101 book and most of the books mentioned are just that, 101 books themselves. Maybe one day the author will wake up to the fact that there are other books that are more advanced and on the intermediate level.br /> <br />The best thing I liked about the book is his section on Group Dynamics.

Yet another Brit who's going to bore us to death about the Lord aspect in Witchcraft and fertility religions and the football is obviously Soccer!\\" Well I'm glad I was wrong. If you enjoyed the Farrar's \\"The Witch's God\\", you'll enjoy this book even better.<br /><br />Mann starts out with an interesting way of dichotomizing the various aspects of the God within the chapters by entitling them like \\"Guide to the Underworld\\", \\"Shape-Shifter\\", \\"The Destroyer and the Destroyed\\", \\"The Rising, Climaxing and Falling God\\" and of course \\"The God of Games\\". There are 25 short chapters in all and they are all independent of one another.<br /><br />Mann basically discusses the various mythological aspects of the God in each chapter and then he gives two or more examples of Gods from different mythological pantheons who fill that role. And to his credit, he does not merely just list the Gods for that particular role, but he explains how the God fits into that role as well.<br /><br />My personal favorite chapters were 18 \\"Good & Evil\\", 19 \\"The Devil\\" & 20 \\"God of Games\\" where he discusses American Football, not Soccer and how he mentions how the God of the Games \\"...it is the contest sought by the God of Games. He is not interested in unequaled or overwhelming odds, in occupation or deceit. He wants to see two or more equally matched men attempt to use every ability at their disposal: mental, physical, emotional and spiritual, to contest each other for greatness and honour.\\" Then he goes on to mention how the Irish hero, Cuchulainn, entered a game of hurling when he arrived at the royal seat Ulster, Emain Macha. In Rome, Mars was the Lord of the Games and in Irelan, Teutates ruled over the games.<br /><br />The bibliography is good as is the index. The only problem with this promotional copy is there's no price on the cover. Michael Mann lives in Glastonbury and has two previous works published that I've not read yet.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars from the fact that it's chock full of material to consider about the Male aspect of Deity when so much is written and doted upon the Female aspect within the Neo-Pagan community. It's also laid out well and the material is first rate. I think every Wiccan or Pagan practitioner who decides to want to work with Deity, should consider obtaining a copy of this particular work.lished that I've not read yet. <br /> <br />I give this book 5 stars from the fact that it's chock full of material to consider about the Male aspect of Deity when so much is written and doted upon the Female aspect within the Neo-Pagan community.

DuQuette has offered both a theoretical and pragmatic view of the Thelemic worldview for the would be Occultist.  He begins with a brief explanation of his own Thelemic ideal in chapter one appropriately entitled \\"Confession\\" and as he progresses thru the book, each chapter subsequently offers his own opinion on how he has assimilated these theories into a workable and reliable form of personal Occultism.<br /><br />When we arrive in chapter two - \\"Qabalah, Zen of the West\\"  - we shown that one can indeed feel not only comfortable with using but also with applying the Qabala to our daily lives by one who is as Western as it gets. What will help the neophyte is how DuQuette explains the complex arts of Gematria & Notariqon & Temura. These are Occult techniques whereby the student can take a word and translate it into a number and by doing so, see how it is related to other words that add up to the same number. Notariqon has to do with generating words from the beginning letters of a passage of scripture and Temura has to do with substituting one letter for another. While I have read<br /><br />the methodology from other authors, DuQuette does a fine job of explaining in simplified terms.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters is the third one wherein DuQuette discourses on the nature of the Holy Guardian Angel that each one of us allegedly has. Interestingly enough, the author shares his thoughts on how some non-Occultists have apparently achieved success without any Occult rites or practices. In fact, DuQuette gives his own theory as to how the individual can make the necessary contact with his/her own HGA purely thru constant thought and desire. His logic is well founded and workable.<br /><br />Finally the last chapter I truly enjoyed was \\"Demons Are Our Friends\\"! Here again this from a man who has DONE the requisite work and experienced first hand accounting of the Spirits. He is not a sit-by type of armchair theorist whose only pretending knowledge of the Goetia Spirits is purely speculative. And he confirms my own belief that \\"the whole technique of summoning and evocation is purely a matter of artistic taste.\\" One can venture into the realm of needing pentacles of protection, robes, wands, etc., and vocalizing all of the conjurations by rote memory because they're romantically enflamed by that mindset OR the practitioner can use Occam's Razor to cut to the quick of the matter and use only what is absolutely necessary to call for such Spirits.<br /><br />All in all, this book is excellent and well worth the investment. I give it five stars as it does include a nice bibliography and an index.a Spirits is purely speculative.

Fully footnoted and annotated it also offers a comprehensive bibliography that draws on non-standard authors - which is rare in the publishing world of Wicca. There is much meat and potatoes in this book although if you're looking for a how-to-do-it approach, you'll have to look elsewhere. GWYN's approach is more of informational and background material much of which covers how traditional Craft workers do things in merry old England.<br /><br />Some of the sources GWYN draws from include authors of articles found in past issues of Mike Howard's English magazine, The Cauldron. Still the sources are both eminent and scholarly and she (I'm presuming GWYN is a 'she' - the book does NOT offer anything about the author's background) uses them to validate her points.<br /><br />One of the best chapters is the 12th which is on \\"Making Traditional Magick\\". (Interestingly enough, for a traditionalist, she hops onto the modern bandwagon of spelling Magic with a \\"k\\" which is just irritating to the rest of us who use the traditional spelling) In this chapter, GWYN discusses a wide variety of folk practices including one of the most abhorred by modern Wiccans, Necromancy.<br /><br />An interesting note from chapter 12 is that there allegedly was a magazine published in 1791 called \\"The Conjurer's Magazine\\" and it had articles on ceremonial magic, astrology and alchemy. Now this would be an interesting find to come across in our modern day if one could discover an issue or more of such an old magazine. GWYN also mentions the home-grown grimoires with titles like \\"The Devil's Plantation\\", 'The Secret Granary\\" and \\"The Book of Cain\\" all of which would be hunted by modern practitioners. These grimoires according to GWYN were books owned by \\"cunning folk\\" who were mainly country practitioners like modern rural Witches and southern Hoodoo Conjurers.<br /><br />In other chapters, GWYN pulls in a LOT of information on the more traditional aspects and roles of the Goddess, the Horned God, the Crossroads and it's functions in the Craft PLUS she even goes so far as to mention what types of tools are used and how they differ from the more Americanized Wiccan traditions.<br /><br />I have to give this book four stars and would've given it five stars had it offered a background on the author.ulls in a LOT of information on the more traditional aspects and roles of the Goddess, the Horned God, the Crossroads and it's functions in the Craft PLUS she even goes so far as to mention what types of tools are used and how they differ from the more Americanized Wiccan traditions. <br /> <br />I have to give this book four stars and would've given it five stars had it offered a background on the author.	2004-09-28
US	49104592	R1FPZ6JX9W5OEK	0738705314	528953165	The Outer Temple of Witchcraft: Circles, Spells and Rituals (Penczak Temple Series)	Books	2	34	50	N	N	Could Have Been Better	I was very disappointed in this work on the whole and the reason for that is the book offers virtually nothing new to the Neophyte Wiccans out there that they have not found in previously released Llewellyn books on Witchcraft and Wicca.<br /><br />Penczak offers this book as a follow up to his \\"The Inner Temple of Witchcraft\\" and if you're of the mind to have a couple of 101 books that take you thru some of the bare bones basics plus a fair amount of supportive material such as planetary correspondences and what-not, then this book and its predecessor are the ones you want.<br /><br />Frankly if you're not tired of reading 101 Witchcraft material, then you could do no worse than Penczak's material. The material covers the usual - grounding, altars, ethics, karma, etc., etc. Chapter 8 begins with the \\"science\\" of spell craft where he gets into theory. He dichotomizes spell craft thru petitions and he claims on page 256 that it's \\"proper witch etiquette suggests you do only three spells per circle\\" and only one circle per day. Now nowhere prior to this reference have I ever heard of this restriction before.<br /><br />As he discusses the Planets and their functions in spell craft, Penczak does give a minor explanation about each individual deity after which the planet is so named. Frankly I preferred his discussion on the Zodiac Signs from pp. 271-279 as it's material that's rarely put forth in your typical Wicca 101 book. The Ritual Record Sheet 288 is nicely done though the lines are spaced too close together for my sloppy handwriting to be able to legibly read it later.<br /><br />With his definition of \\"Sorcery\\" on page 295, Penczak makes me wonder if indeed he's been lurking on one of my Sorcery groups as he nails it right on the head. Then I was impressed with his explanations of Talismans and the art of making Sigils. This is a rare thing for a Witchcraft 101 book and I applaud him for introducing this art to his students.<br /><br />Finally Penczak goes on to discuss the wheel of the year, the gods and how to form a coven in the last few chapters to help round out the 101 curriculum. Sadly the bibliography only includes the typical Llewellyn fare of experts (sic) and frankly if you have most of the books listed in the bibliography, I see little reason to buy this book for its pricey tag.<br /><br />Penczak has penned a decent follow up to his previous book and together they make an excellent set. In fact, if you're of a mind to give two books that'll take someone from knowing nothing to being a 101 Newbie in the Craft, then these would be the ones you'd want to consider giving them.goes on to discuss the wheel of the year, the gods and how to form a coven in the last few chapters to help round out the 101 curriculum.

The result had been to resort to \\"low magic\\" traditions such as Wicca or Santeria to obtain valid herbal lore and techniques. Truth be known, the answers they often sought were found available in their own backyard.<br />The idea of \\"Natural Philosophy\\" as discussed by the Medieval magicians and philosophers has often been overlooked by modern magicians due to the idea that much superstition was underlying that magical paradigm. Truth be told, much of \\"magic\\" had its origins in superstition and it is amazing how later that modern science has confirmed many old superstitions to have some validity. Natural Philosophy is Natural Magic or the understanding of the physical world and how it relates to the universe thru various means such as the law of sympathy.<br />Greer has done an \\"ok\\" job. While his book is not \\"in-depth\\" or encyclopedic, still it is a source that the modern magician can reference. Sadly the drawings of the plants themselves are little more than mere illustrations or line drawings which are hardly enough for one to take with them out in the wilds and choose the exact herb, stem or root alone. In Medieval times, a student may take a nature walk with his teacher and be shown first hand the flora and fauna thus the line drawings would then serve only as a reminder of the shape of the plant. Today however, a nature guide or botanist is almost needed for someone to find the plant in the wild. Preferred would be color photos of the herb as it is growing wild in its natural environment. After all, this is the age of Kodak.<br />The herbs are indexed alphabetically and that is helpful in itself. A cross reference index to the Latin names of the plants would be helpful as well. The Tables of Correspondence are very helpful in that they can help when one is looking for like attributes in different plants. He does give some folklore usually from European sources and none from other traditions such as Latin-American ones. The dire warnings about<br />Part 3, the Natural Magic Workbook is better in that it does give one a small dose of \\"how to use\\" the plants in magical workings. This is illustrated thru sachets, dream pillows, amulets and the like. Greer also gives due credit (a rare thing these days from book authors) to Franz Bardon, author of _Initiation Into Hermetics_, on how to make Fluid Condensers which are magical elixirs involving the use of gold tincture.<br />Finally the book ends with discussions on gardening whether you live in the country or city and a \\"brief\\" discussion on Alchemy. In fact, if he's so inclined, Greer should consider a second book to expand on what he's presented as Natural Philosophy and Alchemy to take the material further.<br />I also would have liked to read some of his own personal anecdotes mixed in with the book. This is a trait that many Llewellyn authors seem to share. They show up and throw up information all over you without conversationally explaining how they used such material in their own lives and how it turned out. But books that try to be \\"textbooks\\" are often lacking in that aspect.

Normally I don't buy 101 level Occult books however this one in particular caught my eye since it's geared towards a much younger audience. The theme is sort of a Hogwarts-cum-Apprenticeship program that's mostly home study. I've been looking for something simple yet comprehensive enough to give to not only my own kids but also to other kids who want to learn the truth about Wizardry & Witchcraft.<br />The only downside to this book are two small things: #1 Oberon mentions Sorcery in the typical \\"black arts\\" vein and pretty much disdains it. And #2 is I'd like to have seen more comprehensive material added on each subject. Yes I know, the book would easily be over a 1,000 pages long as well as very costly.<br />Aside from that, there is little in the book to get a youngster (or first year practitioner) into any trouble. The mentioning of Evoking a Spirit leaves out a lot of essential details that normally if done half-assed, would get someone into some trouble.<br />If you've got a Harry Potter-ite lurking in your family, give them this book and let the child learn of real magic that won't cause you headaches yet allows them to stretch their imaginations with factual evidence about real esoteric Magic and folklore!	2004-02-22

I have summoned and evoked Spirits since the late 80s and not one of the ones I've summoned have ever spun such a yarn! Nor have any of my colleagues who're into evocational magicks has ever heard of such a thing either!<br />Another interesting note is how Savadow claims to be one of &quot;5&quot; practitioners who're even capable of summoning spirits? Right! If that's not ego enhancement, then I don't know what is! There are plenty of others who've shared anecdotes about their Goetia experiments including Poke Runyon, Phil Legard, Don Michael Kraig, Brother Moloch, Donald Tyson, Phil Hine, Lon Milo DuQuette, S. Jason Black, Chris Hyatt, etc., and none of them have the pretentious attitude that Savadow does! Maybe because they are not as full of themselves as Mr. Savadow is?<br />Savadow's claims that you have to go thru this heavy duty physical regimen is nonsense. Evocational Magic is more about Mental &amp; Spiritual power than it is about Physical power! You do not have to practice Yoga or learn all those silly Crowleyan gestures to practice Evocations! LOL<br />The only good thing I can say about this book is that the tables are very nice and neatly laid out. Other than that, it's not worth the cost of the book. If you can get it free or barter for it, then okay. There are far better books out there on this subject than this piece of garbage! What's worse is Savadow should &quot;know&quot; better!!!	2004-01-09
