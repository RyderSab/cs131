Dylan comes across as an utterly unpleasant person in this rather good biography.  As I am not the greatest fan of his music (for reasons I will come to later) this did not bother me too much, but I am sure some of other reviewers would have punished Mr Sounes for this when rating the book.<br />Dylan is portrayed as thoroughly self-centred, somebody with enormous sensitivity in terms of his own feelings (which he conveys with great intensity via his music), but absolutely no sensitivity in terms of others' feelings.  This includes wives, girlfriends and musical associates, all of whom are discarded with disdain when no longer required.  This leaves Dylan a deservedly lonely and disillusioned person towards the end of the book.  In fact, when he falls seriously ill, only one of his many former band members write him, a fate which is not unexpected to the reader given how he had treated them.  It is hard for the reader of this book to have any sympathy with Dylan, and I think the author does a good job of paiting a picture if Dylan without being judgemental- praising the music, but not the man.<br />In terms of music I find Dylan very variable in quality- all of  his earlier recordings contain some great songs, but the weaker songs are always too weak for my liking, and not as good as, say, the weaker songs on a Simon and Garfunkel recording.  And some of his songs are incredibly naive in terms of lyrical content, like Sunshine on the Union on Infidels.  The author describes Dylan's musical decline well, including his return to live performance form in the middle 90's.  I just shudder to think how bad exactly his live performances must have been in the early 90's, because I saw him live in 1996 in London and he was still bad enough.<br />The book has some weaknesses admittedly.  The writing is not always of the highest standard and I sometimes got the impression that the author was quoting people simply because he had spoken to them, and not because they had said anything worth quoting.  But all in all he has produced a fine biography of Dylan, clearly the fruit of much labour.	2003-09-22

As always he is opinionated, sometimes infuriatingly so (I notice from the formal reviews that this does not endear him to academic historians), but that prevents his writing from being dull and academic.  So what if he thinks that England had produced only four authors possessing of true genius- it's his opinion and he is entitled to state it.  In this book Johnson gives a concise overview of the Renaissance: why it happened, and the major figures who contributed to this re-birth of painting, sculpture, etc.  And he keeps it short, mercifully- it was nice to be able to finish a Johnson in a few days instead of a few months.<br />Above all, after reading this I want to re-visit Florence, the centre of the Renaissance, with this book in hand, looking for the wonderful art works produced by the masters.  And I am sure that is what Johnson hoped for when writing this book, that it would make readers excited about the art of the Renaissance.	2003-07-31

But this book does not deserve better.  It has redeeming qualities, admittedly, but not enough to make up for the flaws.<br />The book tells the story of Christopher Banks, who was effectively &quot;orphaned&quot; as a young boy when his parents disappeared while they lived in Shanghai.  He is then sent to England, becomes a well-known detective there and eventually returns to a war-torn Shanghai to try and solve the case of his parents' disappearance.  The book is well enough written, the characterisation is good (as is to be expected of the author), it reads easily enough and the end (in terms of the fate of Banks' parents) unexpected.  But Ishiguro made a few crucial mistakes in this book, the worst one probably being devoting a fairly lengthy passage to Banks' progress through the ruins of war-torn Shanghai to get to the house where he believes his parents are being kept by kidnappers.  This sort of action sequence simply does not suit Ishiguro's style of writing- he should stick to what he does extremely well, which is writing about people, and particularly emotionally scarred ones. Another &quot;mistake&quot; is the (to put it mildly) unlikely scene where Banks chances upon his childood friend in Shanghai.  And lastly, I found it extremely odd that some people seem to expect Banks to in some way ensure world peace and stability by solving the case of his parents' disappearance.  This is never adequately explained, and it is as if Ishiguro had something else in mind with the book initially and failed to re-write the earlier chapters when things panned out differently.<br />But the book is still worth reading- an unsatisfactory book by a great author is still better than most.	2003-07-31

The author wrote, in the form of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, what is effectively a love letter to the city of Savanna, USA, and to its fascinating, eccentric inhabitants, including a flamboyant drag artiste, a homosexual art dealer involved in a very lengthy murder case, a depressed former scientist threatening to poison the city's water supply, and a very likeable conman attorney.  Berendt, a New Yorker, clearly enjoyed immensely the experience of living in Savanna and mingling with its people, and his enthusiasm is infectious.  In fact, this book is a better read than just about any work of fiction I have read.  In the process of telling the story Berendt manages to stay very much in the background, and he never allows his ego to get in the way of describing Savanna and its inhabitants.<br />I believe the movie version of Midnight was not a triumph (not that I have seen it myself), but the book certainly is.  I can quite understand why it was a bestseller, and hope that the author will not take as long to complete his next book as he did this one.  He does, however, have an enormous task ahead of him if he intends to improve, or even just match, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.	2002-12-23
US	44565409	R2ZUCH92NFODCL	0679738053	400854077	The Soccer War	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Good read, but a bit self-indulgent	Kapuscinski is a Polish reporter who worked extensively in war zones in Africa and South America, and most of this book is about his experiences in Africa in the 1960's.  Towards the end of the book he also writes about the war between Honduras and El Salvador (the &quot;soccer war&quot; of the title) which was sparked by soccer internationals between the two countries.<br />I first read this book quite a few years ago and I enjoyed it immensely at the time, and would have given it four stars then.  Upon reading it a second time recently I found it less impressive, though still a good read.  Kapuscinski evokes Africa well, and is very good at describing people, but I now felt that he was directing too much attention to his own experiences/emotions (and bravery?), instead of just describing situations.  I also found the device whereby he keeps on referring to and writing about the book that he plans but never writes (if this does not make sense here, it also doesn't make much sense in the book itself) irritating and more than slightly pretentious, as if he wanted to make The Soccer Wars a more intelligent book than most written about war.  This pretentiousness also shines forth in the very confusing last chapter of the book.  But, having said this, The Soccer War, although not a masterpiece by any means, is still well worth reading, as it deals with a very interesting period in African history, a period that produced some fascinating political leaders.	2002-12-23

Well, I found it reasonably interesting (as was the case with The Art of War), but in the context of history or political science, not in the context of management. In fact, it has very little, if anything, to do with management, except for one or two ideas regarding matters like people management and vigilance in times of good fortune. Machiavelli is an early proponent of realpolitik, and some of his ideas are, to put it mildly, ethically dubious if viewed from a business/management perspective. I would think that the last thing the major Western economies need at this point are (more) Machiavellian managers!<br />I enjoyed the foreword to the edition I read, which I think is the Wordsworth edition, not the one listed here. It sets out nicely the context within which Machiavelli wrote the book without being too detailed.	2002-11-27

The author takes a good look at all Drucker's work, the developments in his thinking over his long and productive life, even his writing style, but it is all done in a rather dry, humourless, academic manner.  It is clear that Drucker is a great thinker on management and society, but it doesn't always come across like that when reading the passages from his books that are quoted.  I think the way the passages are quoted, in boxes separate from the main body of text, serves to decontextualize them, making some of them appear rather shallow and commonplace.<br />Having said this, The World According to Peter Drucker is still a worthy introduction to/critique of Drucker's writings and worth reading.  It is largely concise and to the point, which helps given that it is not all that exciting.	2002-11-27

Just don't expect one of Doyle's gently humorous looks at the lives of working-class Irish people, like his Barrytown trilogy.<br />This novel deals with the eventful first twenty years of the life of Henry Smart, the son of Henry Smart Senior. Senior is a whorehouse bouncer in early 1900's Dublin, and becomes a part-time murderer for the mysterious Alfie Gandon, whom he never meets. He eventually abandons his family, and their slide into desperate poverty and the decline of his wife is described in haunting detail. Henry Junior leaves home to fend for himself, assisted by his little brother Victor, who dies from consumption.<br />Henry Junior then becomes involved with the Republican Movement, not because he is a staunch Republican, but because he is hoping for a better, more socially just, Ireland. He becomes a crack Republican assassin in an increasingly dirty war, and eventually realises that he is serving a new, shadowy elite, one of whom is the same Alfie Gandon his father used to serve.<br />In the process Doyle makes a number of telling points about \\"liberation\\" movements, points not only applicable to the Irish experience. Three of the most important are:<BR>1. Such movements are often mythologised/idealized, with the myth serving to hide skeletons in the cupboard.<BR>2. The leaders of a liberation movement easily form a new elite, intent on amassing wealth and not serving the common people.<BR>3. The footsoldiers in a liberation struggle are dispensable, and often do not gain from the struggle.<BR>But this is not a pedantic novel, and can be read for enjoyment as well. I would rate it as one of Doyle's best two novels to date, on a par with the excellent \\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\".<br />My only gripe with the novel is that Henry is just too perfect a specimen of manhood given that he grows up on the streets of Dublin.  A street kid of 14 who stands 6 feet tall and possesses enormous strength?  Only possible infiction.	2002-11-22

I also didn't expect much from the book, thinking that it would probably be a rather academic piece of writing. And what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! The book was so gripping that I finished it in a few days, reading long passages at a time. It covers the rise to prominence of the dramatis personae of the beat movement (focusing on Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroughs), giving enough information on their backgrounds to facilitate an understanding of how this influenced them and their writing, but does not dwell on unnecessary minutiae in the process. All the information is presented in a concise and remarkably readable manner. The author points out the foibles of the beats, but is not too judgemental, leaving it to the reader to come to his own conclusions.<br />But the best thing about this book is the way the author links events and people in a witty, intelligent way without falling into the very beat trap of being pretentious. It can serve as an example to all authors wishing to write an intelligent, accessible work of non-fiction.	2002-11-08

It provides a good overview of the management consultancy industry, and the rise of management studies to its current status in the business world.  I particularly liked the authors' even-handed approach: they give the industry credit where it is due and do not only dwell on the negatives (and I say this as someone who is quite sceptical about the industry at the best of times).  By the same token, they do point out the negatives as well, especially the industry's dependency on new fads to sell to clients in order to sustain revenues.  I also found the chapters dealing with management styles in the Eastern economies very interesting.<br />Coming to the gripes, my first one is that the book is slightly too long- I think it could have been a good 50 pages shorter, and a much better read, with more judicious editing.  Also, I feel that the authors tried too hard to employ a \\"chatty\\" style of writing, and this is sometimes irritating.	2002-11-01

It points out that all the intellectuals covered in the book did not live according to their own tenets, or highlights other weaknesses in their make-up.  But is this really important in appraising their works/ideas?  Personally, I don't think it is all that important, and I therefore felt that the book was almost tabloid-ish in its approach.

Nabokov writes beautifully, and his characters are very, very human.  The strange thing about the book is that one cannot but feel sympathy for Humbert Humbert, the paedophile narrator, who is as much a victim as his young lover.  I also enjoyed the subtle, sly humour, and the wonderful afterword by Nabokov.  I'm not sure if the afterword is included in this edition, but if not it is well worth getting a copy which has it.<br />I also enjoyed the movie with Jeremy Irons, which did not get the critical acclaim it deserved..<br />Also worth looking for is the spoof Lolita (I think it was called &quot;Grannita&quot;) in Misreadings by Umberto Eco.	2002-10-22

I liked Mailer's simple prose, which displays little of the show-offishness of The Fight, and the way in which he links the familiar events of the gospels, but otherwise I found the book slightly uninspirational. Jesus is portrayed as very human, and as grappling with the problem of how to handle his status of Son of God and the powers that go with it, but this is not a remarkable insight on the part of Mailer. I would think that anybody who has read the Bible with a sense of curiosity would have considered this as well.	2002-10-14

Why I regard this as badly written? The authors assume that the reader has an enormous knowledge of Irish politics and affairs and often refers to people/institutions/events without placing them in any sort of context. They also employ an abundance of quotes which often seems to have no bearing on the preceding or following text, and this often left me confused and frustrated. This smacks of sloppy writing and even more sloppy editing.<br />Then, as said, Ahern is portrayed throughout as a political superman, a king who can do no wrong. This is almost amusing given the events of recent times, where he has had to back down regarding his pet obsession, the so-called \\"Bertie Bowl\\" sports stadium, and has had to renege on a number of election promises because of the unforeseen slump in the Irish economy. It will be interesting to see if history will judge him as kindly as the authors of this flimsy biography.	2002-09-18

I found it amoral, and lacking in humour. It also takes swipes at modern (American) society without suggesting any alternative but a rather primitive response, namely responding with mindless violence, destruction and the creation of mayhem. I give it two stars because Palahniuk can clearly write well, but the whole theme of the book just put me off. And this is not because I particulary dislike books that contain violence and anti-social behaviour- I loved Burgess' brilliant A Clockwork Orange, for instance. I think the absence of humour put me off this book more than anything else.	2002-07-24

Forbes is a delightful author, writing with gentle wit and charm about his childhood on a farm in the Eastern Cape, his tennis career and his life after tennis.

It is filled to the brim with fascinating, larger-than-life characters, with the hangers-on almost as interesting as the pugilists.  But I found Mailer's writing too self-consciously complex and clever at times (probably a sacrilegious thing to say), which detracted from my enjoyment of the book, and cost it a fourth star.  It is, however, still well worth a read for people interested in boxing, Ali, African dictatorships and this bout in particular.  Such people must also watch When We Were Kings (I am probably the umpteenth person saying this), a marvellous documentary about this bout and all the hype and happenings preceding it.

In fact, I did not enjoy The World According to Garp at all, while The Cider House Rules was good, but not exceptional.<br />A Prayer for Owen Meany tells the story of the friendship between two men (one of whom is the tiny, unforgettable Owen Meany of the title), from their childhood to when their friendship is brutally cut short by a deed of heroism for which they had unknowingly been preparing for years. It builds up to a strong, sad conclusion which could easily have become soppy or contrived, but Irving manages to avoid these pitfalls.

I have to agree that it does not contain much in the way of analysis of Kubrick's movies, but that is probably not what the author had set out to do.  It would have been a colossal and much less accessible work had he dealt at length with each of the movies.<br />What I cannot understand is the reaction of some of the reviewers, saying that the author was intent on crucifying Kubrick.  That was certainly not my impression when I read the book, but then I do not regard Kubrick as per se a wonderful person becasue he made acclaimed movies.  He comes across as a much warmer and more human person than I expected, give his reclusive lifestyle, but also as someone who had some flaws, like an inability to start and finish projects.  And that is also what was said about him after his death, so I think Baxter is maybe not that far off the mark in his portrayal.	2001-07-27

There is also a longish chapter about Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, written when Wilson was a very disturbed man, which makes one realise what a miracle it is that he is now performing again. Kent's prose is worthy of his subjects and he portrays them in all their twisted, but fascinating, glory.<br />The book also features a brief, but very good, introduction by the legendary Iggy Pop, which seems to indicate that Iggy could have been some author, had he not decided to pursue a music career.<br />The book made we ponder, anew, a question about artists which has bothered me for many years: are artists destroyed by their art, or do they have to be tortured people from the start to produce work which is different and interesting?	2001-07-27

Some may say it is slow, but I found the prose lovely, with Paton's descriptions coming near to capturing the beauty and sadness of the country.  Paton also avoids falling into the trap of portraying all Black people as noble, and all White people as evil settler types, making the story much more subtle and realistic than many others dealing with South Africa.<br />[...]	2001-07-27

I then went on a Vonnegut binge and though I enjoyed  his other books (with the exception of Galapagos) none came close to this one.  The cover blurb praised the book as \\"funny, compassionate and wise\\" and I can only concur.  The story deals with weighty topics like war and death, and though funny it avoids flippancy.  And in Billy Pilgrim Vonnegut has created one of the most pathetically likeable, characters in all of fiction.<br />If you still wonder if you must read the book, just read the first one or two lines of the story proper (not the introduction).  If that fails to interest you, don't bother.	2001-07-27

I bought it without knowing anything about the author or his work, and enjoyed it very much on a superficial level.  But I also know that I missed out on a lot in the book- nuances and references which I will probably never understand given that I am not Czech.  This is a book I want to re-read soon, and I will do so thoroughly.<br />The narrator is a fascinating creation.  He breezes through a strange life without being unduly affected by whatever fortunes or misfortunes life tosses at him, playing the hand that he is dealt.  His adventures make for a good read, and unlike some other Czech novels I have read the book is quite simple, not a hard slog from cover to cover.	2001-07-27

But Barnes doesn't quite deliver on the promise, although the writing is good and the book has its funny moments.  I enjoyed the list of essential English traits and objects- only notable ommission was the Beatles (if I remember correctly).  Having said this, the book is still worth reading, although I enjoyed The History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters more.	2001-07-27

It is a deceptively simple story about a wasted life spent in self-imposed servitude, at times very funny, but ultimately very sad.  Ishiguro deserves the highest praise for this masterpiece.  Writers who set out to write works of literature and end up creating pompous, unreadable novels should be forced to read this book.<br />The movie is also worth seeing, with Anthony Hopkins the perfect casting.	2001-07-27

Kesey tells a gripping story in a wonderfully sympathetic, humorous manner. And like so many great works of fiction it is written in a fairly simple manner, without using too many stylistic devices. If you are not gripped by the story of the patients and their suffering under the sadistic nurse, you are probably just not meant to be a reader!<br />The book does have one big advantage over the movie, though. It has the character of the giant Indian, the Chief, as a narrator, and he is much more important to the book than to the movie. His personal battle against debilitating fear would have been enough of a plot to sustain a novel.	2001-07-27

Simon Murray is the perfect tour guide to the Legion of the time he writes about.  He writes with style, but not in an affected manner, he is humble regarding his own achievements, and he is sentimental at times, but never descends into soppiness.  This book should be read not only by people who enjoy military yarns, but by anybody who appreciates a good book.  <br />It is tragic that this wonderful book is not in print.  Do yourself a favour and make a real attempt to find a copy.	2001-07-27
US	44565409	R2GUOE1RHXEXD	0785755705	825640350	Forrest Gump	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Very, very funny	I am one of the handful of people on this earth not to have seen the movie, but after reading the book I have no desire to do so.  The book is just so funny that the movie could only be a disappointment.  My favourite favourite scene is the chess match in which Forrest and his opponent try to outwit one another by endless set moves, but I found a number of scenes funny enough to laugh out loud, which I hardly ever do when reading a book.<br />I also liked the portrayal of Forrest as someone who realises that he is not normal, and who is bothered by being different.  Certainly not the happy-go-lucky idiot of the movie (I have, inevitably, seen some snippets).  Actually, I have a confession to make: My main reason for not wanting to see the movie is that I hate Tom Hanks.  But I digress, read the book and try not to spoil it for yourself by picturing TH as Forrest.	2001-07-27

It is certainly a good enough, solid story, reasonably well told, but no masterpiece.  Maybe it's just that the plot element of a person killing another he loves as an act of compassion has been used too often since (e.g. Betty Blue and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).<br />So read the book, by all means, but don't harbour the expectations I had. It's a short little book, not complex at all, so it won't be hard work even if you don't like it all that much.	2001-07-27

As a South African working in Ireland I found the book a good source of information about Ireland, and especially the recent history of the country.  It also confirmed a lot of things I had noticed myself, for instance that the Irish are lacking in a sense of tidiness.  I have to agree, though, that it is not very engaging.  I also found the author's use of conversations with normal people as evidence of trends or widely held views excessive and, at times, irritating.<br />Also, the book probably needs to be updated to take the effect of the Celtic Tiger on the Irish way of living into account.  The country seems to be in the grip of materialism.  The author also glosses over the issue of alcohol abuse.  It seems to be a very real problem among students and young working people, but most Irish seem to view it as charming and part of their culture.	2001-07-27

It is a magical book, with strange diversions like the The Piper chapter, and contains beautiful pieces of prose about so many topics, like the lure of travelling and the joys of having a place you can call your own.  Writing the review makes me want to read the book again.  Above all the book has a nice story about friendship and loyalty...and Toad is one of the most attractive flawed characters in fiction.<br />This book should be compulsary reading.	2001-05-17

I found it contrived to the extent of becoming irritating, and wonder why I bothered finishing it. The mystical element in the story is unnecessary and seems to be an all-too-popular device in modern Afrikaans fiction. Why not just give us a well-written, plain story (such as Remains of the Day), and spare us the spirits?<br />To me the best thing about the book was the descriptions of the town where it is set, which seems to be an amalgam of my beloved East London and Port Elizabeth, the two major cities of the Eastern Cape (where Van Heerden lectured for a number of years). But that is insufficient to redeem it.	2001-05-17

Being Afrikaans, like the author/principal character (I believe that a lot of what the principal character experiences in the book, happened to the author in real life) it really spoke to me at the time.  I cannot say how I will react to the book today (maybe the principal character's angst will irritate me now), but I think the book paints a good picture of a time when many Afrikaners started questioning the establishment, if only in their hearts.	2001-05-17

I think he tried to squeeze too many themes and sub-plots into one book, and also that the narrator takes too long to resolve his inner turmoil about his extra-marital relationship.  But the book is nonetheless worth reading for the prose, which is exemplary.  This is not a book to read in small chunks on trains and planes, and should be tackled under perfect reading conditions.	2001-05-17

The summaries of the gurus' ideas are concise, and the biographical details of the gurus interesting and not too long.  The book made me want to explore the works of some gurus.  I also enjoyed the author's criticism of some of the gurus, as I am a bit of a sceptic regarding the many fads devised by management consultants.<br />Criticism?  Too many typos, indicative of sloppy editing.	2001-05-17

I enjoyed the simplicity thereof, and the beautiful prose that the author applied in just the right amount.
