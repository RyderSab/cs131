I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. Every last word. The two leading characters are great together. And the sex, TALK ABOUT HOT!! The prince was amazing; the 16 year old sister was a nice touch. The only thing that could have made this better was if she had been pregnant in the end. I Loved it, Loved it, Loved it. I definitely recommend!	2005-07-01

I loved it. I was really moved by this story. I thought the characters were well developed, and though the ending was predictable, you still want to read the entire thing to find out the events that bring them to that end.  <br /> <br />I am a classic romance reader, so I typically stay away from Nicholas Sparks books because I know that most likely someone is going to die in the end, and I can't stand it. But this one is worth reading. I also read The Wedding. Another great book in which everyone lives.  <br />	2005-06-27

I would get disinterested in a particular passage, put it down, and find it hard to pick it back up. I finally forced myself to read it, and I would say it was okay. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the ending very much, it just took a long time to get there. I knew early on what the twist was going to be, so I wasn't surprised, but I enjoyed the experience of surprise through the characters. The most enjoyable thing about this book was that everyone lives, no one dies at the end and there's no tragedy to cry through. That in itself gained this book an extra star. All in all a good read.   <br />	2005-06-27

It was okay, I liked it until the trailer scene. ...the enjoyment ended there. I love romance novels, so don't get me wrong. But even as romance novels go, this one was just a bit flat.  <br /> <br />I have read over 20 of Sandra Browns books, and about half of them were great, half not. Usually because there was a lack of excitement, or because the characters contradicted themselves. The almost rape in this one was good. It spiced it up, made it exciting. But that's as good as it gets.  <br /> <br />It might have been nice if they did have to actually battle it out with the grandparents, or if Katherine would have left after having found out about Jace's ex-wife and catching them in what looked like a compromising position. Her running off with the baby again would have made it exciting. Or she could have ran off when Jace left without a word for two days to go rescue his ex-wife, she should have been gone when he returned. But alas, none of that happened. Katherine just kept taking it. She was a total walking contradiction. As I said, the story is flat and predictable. The so called explosion at the end was just a stupid cop-out way to end the story. So I wouldn't break my neck to run out and buy this one. Read only if you have nothing better to do. <br />	2005-06-27

I think what I didn't like about it was how mean the DA had to be in the beginning, and the unrealistic and completely unrelated line of questioning he took her through on the stand. Nothing he said had anything to do with the case against the two surviving men who were on trial. It was just ridiculous, and only succeeded in irritating me.<br /><br />And the other thing was the loss of her baby. Hunter was not broken up enough about that, and it was partially his fault if you ask me. Plus, how do you fall in love with someone you've never even met (as Hunter did with Kari). That stupidness just killed it for me.<br /><br />The best part of the story is when Kari is suspended and goes to the mountains, and Hunter followers her. The story is all good while they are in the mountains on a mini break, but then, I don't know, it was kind of flat from there. Nice enough read, I guess. I would recommend Eloquent Silence or Two Alone instead.	2005-06-24

I'm not hooked like I was after I read my first Sandra Brown, but I'll give Nora another try. This book was a departure from the typical romance novels I read. There was no descriptive sex; the intimacy is only implied. I have to say that was a surprise, and a nice change. Even though I'd say this was an average read, I like Mrs. Roberts writing style, and am interested to see what her newer works will be like. Yes, I would recommend this book for a lazy afternoon read. <br />	2005-06-13

It's flat, and not to mention silly. I didn't like either or the main characters, it just didn't do it for me. I believe this was Sandra's first novel (don't quote me). If it was, I'll give her credit, it was not bad for a first. But like I said, just leave it on the shelf and move on.	2005-06-13

But if you're like me, you won't. However, even without my convictions, this book was still pretty sorry. First off, it's slow. Second, the leading lady, who by the way was the main reason I disliked this book so much. (However, judging by the other reviews, I'm in the minority)  <br /> <br />It might not have been so bad if we weren't made to believe that Rink, the son of the man Caroline married, was the real love of her life, yet she married the father anyway for money, status, and a stupid house. What kind of woman does that? Not one that I could like. The Retreat? PLEASE!!! Give me a break. She must not have loved Rink too much. What made me the maddest about her was her response to the reading of the will. She tells Rink \\"her true love\\" to contest the will in which his father left him nothing, but left his mothers house (The Retreat) to her, his stupid wife. I just could not believe it. I would have said, contest it huh, why don't you just give it back to me you tramp. She was just selfish, stupid, of weak moral character, and she was always putting her nose where it didn't belong. SB tried to redeem her in the end, but it was too late as far as I was concerned. Anyway, bottom line, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!  <br />	2005-06-08

Yes, we all know there is scandal in Washington, and that politicians usually have their share of skeletons, but this was completely ridiculous  ...but not in a bad way. It's fiction, so it stretches the imaginations. It would make a great movie drama for sure. Overall, though very unrealistic, I still enjoyed it. Hey, we all enjoy movies that are way out there, this book is no different. The sexual encounter between the two lead characters which happens a hot second after they meet did catch me off guard, but it keeps you on your toes. I gave it three stars because there wasn't enough romance for me, but it WAS well worth the read ...and the money. Thumbs WAY up!	2005-06-07

Typical of SB's male characters, the lead male is very sure of himself, strong, forward, and rather aggressive. Qualities I happen to like in a man, but see very little of in real life.

Her talents, like her stories, are a constant work in progress, and this is an earlier novel. There are some that should no doubt be skipped (Unspeakable, Bittersweet Rain, Hawk O'Tooles Hostage) while there are others that are `must have's' (Two Alone, Adam's Fall, Breakfast in Bed). This one falls somewhere in the lower middle. It's a fast read, and entertaining. Sure, it's a bit dated, but I enjoyed the characters, and while yes, the ending in predictable, I still held my breath waiting for the moment when Trent finally sees the real Rana for the first time. If you're a Sandra Brown romance fan, I don't think you'll be disappointed. And you'll love Aunt Ruby. Go ahead, read it.	2005-06-06

I had to keep looking at the cover to make sure I had the correct author. I couldn't believe Mrs. Brown wrote this. I still can't believe it. If I could, I'd give it 0 stars. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the lead male character. HE WAS AWFUL! Because he was so mean, I found it hard to sympathize with the plight of him and his people. Nor could I accept that at some point in the story he and the lead female would fall in love. The level of Hawk's heartlessness was just over the top. Throughout the whole book, he is constantly spewing verbal abuse, not to mention being physically threatening. He was horrible. And the story line, the whole scenario seemed out of place for the time period its set in. Now the heroin. ...ugh. I hated her too. There's no way in the world any woman would warm to a man like this. He kidnapped her and her son, kept her son aware from her, abused her, and yet she still let him touch her. THERE'S JUST NO WAY! Like I said, I just could not believe it. Would not recommend that you read this book. I kept reading hoping that there would be something redeemable at the end. There wasn't. Needless to say I could have put those three hours to better use. <br />	2005-06-01

I just came off reading A Kiss Remembered, and Bittersweet Rain, both of which left me disappointed, so this was a welcomed change. I enjoyed the characters, their chemistry and I laughed at their friendly (and not so friendly) banter. I thought the ending was a bit unrealistic too, but not so much so that it ruined the story. It was a nice read, especially if you have a few hours to pass. Not a `must have', but worth borrowing from the library.

Breakfast in Bed was my introduction to Mrs. Brown, and I was HOOKED. So this book holds a special place in my heart (and in my collection too.) I have three categories of Sandra Brown books... <br /> <br />C) Why did I buy this? I'll give it away  <br />B) Nice read, I'll loan it out   <br />A) Sorry, you can't borrow it because I'm about to read it AGAIN! <br /> <br />This one is an \\"A\\" lister. Yes, you may question what kind of friend Sloan is, but in the end, it won't matter and all will be forgiven. These characters have great chemistry and this is a great story, one where the end will not leave you flat. In fact, if you like it, pick up `Send No Flowers' when you're done. For those of you who like a good love story, especially a steamy love story, this one's for you.

I wasn't blown over, wasn't wowed or anything, but I wasn't disappointed either. It was simple, yet endearing. I too am a single mother of two lovely children, and have been accused of being too reserved and uptight, so could relate to Elizabeth's character. (I can also enjoy a good daydream now and then) It's a good read, not her best, but good just the same. If nothing else, you have to read it just so you know how it all began when you read `Adam's Fall', which IS one of her BEST! ...2.5 Stars	2005-05-27

I liked Laws character at first; it was his actions that miffed me. Like the birthday gift, and the living arrangements. It didn't appear as though he had any regard or respect for the woman who had rearranged her life to rear his child alone. Especially at such a young age. And as a single mother myself, I have to say, I kept waiting for David (her son) to choose Marnie over Law, to make it clear that she hadn't been replaced by this arrogant, famous, rich ....person. It burned me that he didn't. And as for Marnie, I wanted her to make Law beg a little more, she made it to easy for him. I wanted her to move away and make him chase her.  Anyway, that's my two sense. Go ahead ...read it. A word of caution to single mothers: Be prepared.	2005-05-27

Especially if you're a new Sandra Brown reader. (as I am) <br /> <br /> I read it in one day only because it was easy, not because it was good. I've only read about 12 of her books thus far, but usually with her novels, the characters come alive. They stick with you and you hold on to them and their story as though these were people you actually knew. Well I read this one about 3 months back, and I can barely remember it now.

It has that `stranded' feel to it at the beginning, which I love. I loved both Alicia and Pierce; however I did grow impatient with him throughout the book. But in the end, it was worth the wait. And it warmed my heart to read the inclusion of old friends from Breakfast in Bed.

It's a one day read, and definitely worth it.

Literally.  <br /> <br />The story is so well written. Usually books have highs and lows; this book stays on top the whole time. I can't say enough about how well developed these characters are, and how well written this story is. Lilah is hilarious. She's quick and witty. You'll absolutely love her. I laughed out load on several occasions. And you have to love the position Adam is in, especially if you know his character from 'Fanta C' and how these two met.
