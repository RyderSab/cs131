The first half of the book (the first 200 or so pages) could easily have been worth the price of the book alone, as he details 10 factors that he believes has led to the world going  flat (some factors include the entry of geeks from former USSR countries, over-provisioning of fibre optic connectivity, the modern supply chain, and the use of out-sourcing). The second half of the book delves into deeper analysis of how American IT workers can cope with this new world and how world politics is affected by the very same factors that are flattening the world. <br /> <br />Some things I did not like about the book: <br /> <br />1. The metaphor of the world being flat is wrong. If anything, a better metaphor would be simply a \\"smaller world.\\" Calling the world flat suggests a negative connotation of the ignorant and backwards pre-1492 world (but this could apply to current-day Kansas though). <br /> <br />2. Friedman suggests modern distributed software architectures like Web services (e.g. SOAP) is one of the 10 major factors causing the flatness, but Web services is still not proven at all. I suspect Friedman (who is admittedly an AOL user for goodness' sake) just threw in some buzzwords without knowing all the facts. <br /> <br />3. His suggestion for American IT workers coping in the modern world sounds a lot like the pre-bubble stock investing: buy high, sell higher. He advises Americans to improve their skills and just find new jobs because even though IT jobs are moving abroad, this situation will open up new job opportunities. Buy high, sell higher indeed. At some point, middle-class IT workers (with M.S. degrees even) will just give up and move onto some worthless liberal arts jobs; what will Friedman think of this bust at that point? <br /> <br />	2005-08-28

One of the book's concluding points is that if you are skilled and experienced in your field, then being able to quickly make decisive and correct decisions will come naturally. Nothing new there. Some people would simply say \\"with experience comes intuition.\\" The author further notes that unless one is fully trained, the initial gut reaction can be misleading for a number of reasons, such as subconscious bias or stress. An abundance of stories is presented to support all the points in the book, but most adults will have already come across all the issues through lifelong experience. <br /> <br />One thing for which I was hoping was a discussion on how to hone yourself to make better \\"blink\\" decisions outside your field of expertise. The author does not address this at all except for one small suggestion saying that it's better to reduce the amount of information one has to process in order to make a good decision. This approach is a good idea, but the author delves no further. <br />	2005-06-05

Filled with run-on sentences and paced slower than a tortoise, this book is truly a chore to read. There is no point to this novel; it is simply an account of a day in the life of an airheaded wench and those who have been unfortunate enough to know her. There is no closure at the end, for there is no plot for which closure is needed. The characters are varied, but I really never became interested in any of them. However, on a more positive note, this book will suffice as kindling should the need arise.	2005-05-28

It is not relevant if Gene jostled the tree with malice or not. I think it was pretty clear in the book that Gene was filled with paranoia, jealousy, and mixed emotions leading up to that point, and from his point of view, even he does not fully understand why he did it. However, this issue is really just a precursor to a more significant issue: how Gene is unable to reconcile his feelings and express his regret to Finny. Each time the two talk about what happened, they are left as stuttering fools, and at the times when Gene talks to Leper and Brinker, Gene denies his actions out of guilt and as a result is unable to just get the whole ordeal off his chest. In fact as the story progresses, it is clear that his suppressed emotions and inability to resolve them lead directly to the tragic ending.<br /><br />Great book.	2005-04-22

The author introduces himself as a character in his book about 2/3 of the way through and gives away the ending to his own story. Bizarre to say the least, and at first glance, I was inclined to think of it as a cheap narrative device, particularly after reading Cat's Cradle, which was a fantastic story. However, I came to realise that the author *was* a part of the story, offering his views and emotions on subjects as widely-varying as American intervention in wars overseas (he might as well have been writing about Iraq), death of family members, insanity, one's mortality, sex. And so on. The author is himself a part of the story with much to add on these topics, but he relegates himself to a secondary role behind Kilgore Trout and Dwayne Hoover. <br /> <br />The most notable character to me, though, was Zog, the farting and tap dancing space alien.

I found the book to be extremely well written and very compelling to read. Although dealing with advanced topics, the authors' friendly and clear writing style makes it accessible to anyone with a CS background.<br /><br />The first half of the book is on search heuristics, covering methods such as traditional searches (exhaustive search, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, A*, etc), methods to escape local optima (simulated annealing, tabu search), and, perhaps most interesting of all, evolutionary algorithms. I later found out that these topics are typically taught in undergraduate artificial intelligence courses, an elective I never took. The second half of the book covers even more advanced areas, such as contraint-handling, neural networks, and fuzzy systems.<br /><br />The authors use three recurring example applications to demonstrate each search technique: the boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), travelling salesman (TSP), and a nonlinear programming problem (NLP). I really liked the consistent use of these three examples, as they give a sense of continuity throughout the book that helps the reader compare search techniques clearly. I had of course studied the TSP problem in my undergraduate algorithms class but never  in the context of such interesting approximation algorithms. In my heuristics class we had assignments to implement the TSP search problem using the Lin-Kernighan method, dynamic programming, and an evolutionary algorithm.<br /><br />The written English in this book is simply outstanding and crystal-clear, which was something of a shock since I was unable to even pronounce the first author's name. The writing is in a very friendly tone with elements of humour dispersed throughout. Interestingly, in the summary chapter, there is an anecdote on the 1980s TV show Magnum PI (I even remember the mentioned scene myself), further revealing the friendly, plain-English tone of the book. Perhaps the best part of the book is that the numerical mathematical discourse is kept at a minimum (used largely for the NLP problems), so people who haven't taken calculus in ages (like me) can easily enjoy the book.<br /><br />As an added bonus(!), between each chapter is a brain-teaser problem like those found in those legendary Microsoft interview questions.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there is no simple analysis of the running time complexity of each algorithm, which even in its simplest form would have been a great thing to read about.<br /><br />In summary, this book is an excellent read if you enjoy the topics covered.

By running this smear campaign (which even our \\"elected\\" President has himself denounced in late August), the authors have brought into question the validity of all injured and killed soldiers in the history of the USA. Now, there is no validity or value to any Purple Heart, Bronze Star, or anything else signifying injury while fighting to defend this country.

Bush is going to burn in hell for the atrocities he's done to this country.<br />First, he refused to listen to sage advice warning him about the dangers of Al Quaeda. That incompetence cost 3000 American lives during the 9-11 attacks.<br />Second, he bluntly lied to the American people, trying to pin the 9-11 terrorist act on Saddam. He steadfastly stated that Saddam had WMD and that he had links with Al Quaeda and 9-11. Both have turned out to be obvious lies. Both Paul O'Neil and now Richard Clarke have stated that Bush had been trying to find a good reason for invading Iraq, and Bush found it. Why? Most likely he was still angry that Saddam had tried to assassinate his father in 1993.<br />Third, Bush continues a smear campaign against anyone going against him. Clarke served as terrorist expert for Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and even Bush Jr. himself. Now all of a sudden Clarke cannot be trusted? Ridiculous.<br />You neocons should look into the mirror hard and ask yourself how it feels to be a sheep.	2004-03-29

I found the writing style and organisation of topics to be very good. The authors describe key object-based and object-oriented concepts first using familiar C constructions and then extend those ideas into the C++ domain. The ease of transitioning from C structs to C++ classes was very good, as was the discussion of subtle points like the copy constructor. Almost all major C++ concepts are described, including inheritence, virtual functions, and even templates.<br />My only negative criticism is that the authors leave out some important C++ functionality from their view of the C++ &quot;core.&quot; They only mention in passing the use of const, considered by many to be vital to good C++ design. Also, since this book was published in 1995, it does not discuss the C++ standard library, which was finalised in 1997. It is therefore missing a discussion of the very useful 'string' class, among many others. Readers should defininitely follow up on these topics.<br />Regardless of this missing information, this book will give C programmers a solid foundation for using C++.	2004-02-12

I had seen Kubrick's movie adaptation a few years ago (amazingly, on September 12, 2001 while stuck overseas in Caracas, Venezuela due to the attack) and found it to be a pretty good movie, but surely, I thought, Kubrick must have left out some of the more lascivious scenes (I was right). The novel is so well-known that it's even alluded to in the Police song \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me.\\" However, after seeing that it was #4 on the Random House Modern Library 100 best novels of the 20th century, I decided to read it.<br />The stylish language in the book is pure opiate. Written in perfect, rich English by its Russian author, the novel tells the tale of a middle-aged paedophile on a self-destructive bent. Paedophilia is, of course,  one of the most disgusting crimes imaginable, and most normal humans would never even give a nanosecond's worth of thought into it. This book provides us with a long look into the subject matter. Humbert's unapologetic self-analysis of his affliction was particularly memorable: \\"We are not sex fiends! We do not rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, bur ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet.\\" That is so sickly rational that it's scary.<br />It's written in flashback narration with clever foreshadowing that's dropped from time to time. (The description on p. 31 is particularly subtle: The Little Nymph, Vivian Darkbloom, photography.) The discussion at the end of this edition by Nabokov himself is worth reading as well, including his enlightening discussion of the \\"subliminal co-ordinates\\" laid out.<br />This is a beautifully-written book.  If you're not too turned off by the subject matter, it's well worth your time.	2004-01-19

The author describes the basics of load balancing, including NAT, session persistence, and network architectures. A discussion on application-layer parsing was quite good. There is also a chapter on global server load balancing (including incorporating load-balancing into the authoritative DNS server) which I found to be very detailed and interesting.<br />Much of the book is centered on how to load balance TCP (and to a lesser extent UDP), and the author uses HTTP and FTP as his primary driving examples. Throughout the book, the author provides some insight regarding what approaches real companies use (e.g. &quot;this method is what Foundry and Cisco uses.&quot;), which I liked very much. Also, the illustrations were plentiful (although a bit primitive-looking).<br />There are only a few negatives about this book. The english writing is a bit stilted at times, and the chapters on firewalls and caches were basically rehashes of earlier chapters. Finally, I was hoping the author would have provided more detail on the load-distribution heuristics (which server to choose) with more metrics and actual real-world results.<br />I found the book to be extremely well organised. You will not get lost while reading this book, but you will need a university-level understanding of TCP/IP (and probably the link layer as well to get the NAT material) and networks in general to fully appreciate the matieral. Overall, a great book.	2003-11-09

Signet produces good editions of Shakespeare's plays. The footnotes are numerous, and the footnote mark in the body of the text is not intrusive (they use a superscripted 'o' instead of a number). The paper quality is good, and the font is quite clear.<br />This collection of four of the Bard's comedies is a very cost-effective way of getting four books for a lower price than if you bought them separately. It includes a 17-page scholarly introduction that's focused specifically on the four comedies here.  The comedies then follow, with no intermediary text.<br />One thing that is missing is the nice introductory 50-page biographical sketch of the Bard found in other Signet Shakespeare books. I also have the Signet editions of Romeo & Juliet and Othello, and both of those have the same 50-page introduction. I do not know if the individual editions of these four comedies have the same, but I would think so. Hence, if you already have another Signet edition of any of the Bard's plays with that introduction, the omission of it here won't be a big deal at all.	2003-09-03

(Note to Dorea, my Spanish-1 instructor from years ago: I tried my best, and I failed my miserably. The lesson is, I'll never try that again.)<br />There is a clear theme in this book, at least to me. Five generations of this family, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, are all bonded. Lust, tragic character flaws, and fate tie the generations together. However, this is a difficult story to follow, as many readers have already mentioned. The characters in the multiple generations are given very similar names, making the genealogy tree at the beginning of the book invaluable. (By the way, the tree in this edition is much better drawn than the one in the Spanish-language Catédra edition, although that one has a nice 50-page introduction.) Although I wouldn't say I was ever thoroughly bored by the writing, I sometimes felt the storyline was a bit rambling. It's still a powerful story, and the apparent rambling is more than justified by (and perhaps even a prerequisite for) the incredible final page.	2003-09-03

Throughout the book, Steinbeck gives us an intimate insider's view of the Joad family by providing a narration and dialogue with an incredibly fine level of detail. The description of the poverty and difficulties of the Joads is so vivid that I couldn't help but feel for the human condition back then. To be poor is one thing, but to live without knowing where your next meal is coming from is quite another.<br />The most vivid passage for me is in Ch. 28, when the Joads have been working on the cotton farm for a while and Ma Joad has accumulated enough money to finally go on a &quot;spending spree&quot; at the market. She probably didn't have more than a few dollars, yet when she buys enough food for the whole family, I actually felt a sense of relief, for it seemed they were as rich as kings.<br />To me there are two resounding themes present in this novel. First of course is the strength of the family in the face of adversity. &quot;Family&quot; means more than blood ties; it means people who have shared your suffering and will lend a recipricol hand when needed. This relationship also means that walls will be built to keep some out: note how Tom quickly brushes off the one-eyed mechanic who hopes to come along on the trip. The second theme for me is the yearning for labour, &quot;muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need -- this is man.&quot; We still see this today in America: a need to work for something beyond just money, it is a need to be productive and busy, to surpass our parents, and to produce successful offspring.<br />A final note about this Penguin edition: It evidently reproduces the original typesetting from 1939, so it quite long at 619 pages. However, don't be put off by the length. The font is large, and the interline space is relatively wide. This book could easily be around 100 pages less with a more modern typesetting.	2003-08-31

I remember buying it when it first came out in Fall 1995. I was an undergraduate senior at the time and thought I was a hotshot C programmer. How mistaken I was! Reading through this book was a humbling experience, as each page showed me fine details of C that I did not already know.<br />This is an excellent book. It is organised into chapters on different aspects of C, and in each chapter are dozens of FAQs that range from rather common to extremely fine-detailed. Three chapters which I particularly liked were Chapter 1 (declarations and initalisations), 3 (expressions and evaluation order), and 6 (arrays and pointers). Later chapters introduced new (at the time) concepts to me, including getopt, variable-length argument lists, and preprocessor tricks. The level of detail provided in each answer is extraordinary.<br />Other things I liked about the book: The index is excellent. There is a lot of discussion (spread across the FAQs) on the differences between K&amp;R and ANSI C. (This was relevant to me because at the time, I was splitting my work between gcc and the proprietary cc compilers on DEC Ultrix and SunOS.) The style of writing is friendly and does not talk down to you.

Even if you're an XML author, you will find this book lacking in the latter chapters. Almost all the discussion is extremely general and theoretical. Occasionally the author sprinkles in a few fucntional XML snippets, but they are not nearly enough. Furthermore, there are only about a dozen complete examples of functional XML available in the tar/zip file available online at O'Reilly.<br />The paucity of examples was particularly frustrating in the XSLT chapter. By its very nature, XSLT screams out for illustrative examples showing 'before' and 'after' transformations, but the author provides very few such examples.<br />Another thing that really irked me was the condescending writing style of the author. Here's an example from Ch. 4 on CSS:<br />&quot;A CSS stylesheet is a collection of rules... An analogy for this process is painting-by-numbers. In this activity, you purchase a painting kit that comes with paints...&quot;<br />Really now! This style of writing is not necessary and is frankly offensive. XML inherently is not a beginner's topic; a reader who picks up this book is most likely an IT manager or a developer and does not need to be talked-down upon.<br />If you're a java developer, I suggest you take a look at &quot;Processing XML with Java&quot; by Harold.	2003-07-04

It is largely focused on the Golden Section (Phi) and related proportions, including Fibonacci numbers, sqrt(Phi), etc. The explanation of how to derive this number is clearly explained in the first few chapters. The following chapters show how Phi is related to most things we see everyday, including architecture, 5-point animals, crystal latticies, art, and music. This book is quite old, so the illustrations seem rather antiquated. Nonetheless, the quantity and clarity of these illustrations are impressive.<br />The writing was clear, but the concepts were occasionally difficult to understand. The author made mention of &quot;gnomic&quot; growth a number of times without really giving a single clear definition. Also, I felt that a number of the tie-ins between Phi and architecture were a bit of a stretch. Most likely you could overlay any graph over a blueprint and see any proportion you'd want to see. At any rate, this book has gotten me interested in this subject, and I will be looking for more books on Phi.	2003-04-22

It was a pleasant surprise for me that the class utilised this textbook. I have been at the university level in CS for 8+ years (grad + undergrad), and this book is *by far* the best introductory  computer science textbook I have ever read in any CS subject.<br />The book is very well-written and extremely interesting to read. I was never bored in any chapter. Kurose and Ross are knowledgable experts in their field, and their exposition of the material is fantastic. Unlike Tanenbaum's book, they start at the application layer and move down. IMHO, this is a far better pedagogical strategy, because young students these days already have an excellent layer-5 understanding thanks to daily interaction with HTTP, IM, P2P file sharing, etc. If I remember correctly from my undergrad days, my own experience in a bottom-up approach, starting at the physical layer, really put me to sleep and put me off from networking. That's a shame, because networking is a really exciting field.<br />The best parts of the book are the breadth, thorough use of real-world topics, and the illustrations. In fact, the diagrams and illustrations are just plain great. Most technical writers often rely too much on the written word. Here, the authors augment almost every pair of pages with an illustration; this is simply remarkable. The explanations of fundamental topics (such as packet-switching, DNS, TCP congestion control, IP routing, and ethernet) are *extremely* clear. More advanced topics are very up-to-date, covering cutting-edge subjects such as P2P, CDNs, security, NATs, 802.11, RTP, etc. I have not found a better introductory explanation of CDNs anywhere else. Although networking does have a lot of math in various areas, this introductory book does not get too much in detail in mathematical discourse, making this book very readable.

To me, it was the waiting, presumably endless, that was important.<br />It is clear that Estragon and Vladimir represent commen men waiting for some \\"real meaning\\" to be evident in their lives that will fulfill their emptiness. To me, the title could have easily been \\"Waiting for Pizza\\" or \\"Waiting for Miss Right\\" -- it doesn't matter. The object of their waiting, Godot, could even be extended to even mean a deity or some spritual happiness. What was important to me was the waiting; the hope in the face of hopelessness and the perserverance to find meaning are strengths of mankind.<br />The story in itself is pointless -- that is, without a finality found in the third act of the traditional play. However, that could very well be the main point.	2003-04-20

The book is filled with beautiful photography and good writing. Note that this book is relatively up-to-date (published in July 2002), and it does a fairly nice job explaining how the Oslo Accords fell apart in the latter 1990s. Of particular interest is the second half of the book that has short biographies of the major players involved. <br />The maps in this book are excellent, showing how the borders have changed with respect to the territories, especially the W. Bank. The best part of this book is the photography: the photos are absolutely gorgeous. This one's a keeper, but be sure to augment your library (and your knowledge) with a more thorough and academic treatment of this conflict's history. e.g. Tessler's book.	2003-04-20

This is not an introductory book, so don't bother to read it unless you have a solid understanding of Spanish basics, including basic conjugation, the subjunctive mood, etc.<br />This book has a lot of tips to sharpen your Spanish. Chapter 8 has \\"sentence starters\\" to help you start off your spoken Spanish; evidently these are the equivalent to English's \\"well...\\" or \\"the thing is...\\" Chapter 9 has \\"snappy answers\\" organised according to how you want to respond (e.g. in disbelief, with surprise, etc.) The answers for affirmation are quite useful (e.g. esta bien, claro, de acuerdo). Of course, you can easily get this information from any college-level textbook, but the distribution of these words into nicely organised categories is quite useful. There is also a chapter on how to swear effectively (evidently chingar is a strong word), which I never did in my classroom. An earlier chapter on how to use 64 key verbs was invaluable as well.<br />One particular chapter I loved was how to choose the correct Spanish word for particular English verbs. This can get tricky for some English infinitives like \\"to become\\" and \\"to happen.\\" Another chapter on the history of the Spanish language was very interesting to read.<br />One thing I didn't like was the treatment of the subjunctive mood -- it left me a bit more confused, and my Spanish teacher actually told me that some information was incorrect. Finally, one glaring omission that I hope the author writes about in any later edition is the use of \\"por\\" vs. \\"para\\". To me, this trickiness is right up there with \\"ser\\" vs. \\"estar.\\"	2003-04-20

Riddled with typos and grammatical errors, this book by itself is reason enough for the existence of the entire spelling-checker software industry. <br />Another thing that really bugs me is that in the very first chapter he immediately jumps into Cisco router command-line jargon. Wait a minute, I thought to myself, where the [expletive deleted] did that come from? I thought I bought a book on IP routing, not on how to run a [expletive deleted] router. There are better ways to present IP addresses and their relationships  than to show output from a router; why didn't the author consider just using a table? Aggrevating this is the fact that he starts using this Cisco CLI [expletive deleted] in the first chapter without even telling the reader the context -- like what machine this is, what the version is, why he thinks this is relevant to his presentation, or anything else. Investigating further, the only mention of Cisco is in the preface: \\"This book is not meant to be replacement for Cisco manuals.\\" A-ha, so that's what this [expletive deleted] is, thanks a lot. <br />The writing itself is at many times very hard to understand. Like most technical writers, the author relies too much on the written word instead of complementing his descriptions with diagrams. Here's an example of his opaque writing from the chapter on BGP, my favourite routing subject:<br />\\"Multi-homing to different ISPs also creates problems with this schema. Uncle-Q has the address block 180.180.1.0/24 from ISP-X but he also connects to ISP-Z. ISP-Z would have to carry Brother-X's specific route 180.180.1.0/24. In other words, since ISP-Z advertises Brother-X's prefix, the routing tables in the attached ASs would see both the aggregate 180.180.0.0/16 from ISP-X and 180.180.1.0 from ISP-A.\\"<br />After reading the above, my first question was \\"What the [expletive deleted] was that?\\" To be fair, that excerpt is accompanied by a small diagram, but it's not at all sufficient. What the [expletive deleted] is Uncle and Brother doing in this example? Where the [expletive deleted] did ISP-A come from? Good grief.<br />If you're interested in an introduction to this topic, just grab the nearest undergraduate textbook on Networking.	2003-04-07

Prior to reading this book, I had never even seen what he looks like, yet his work and dedication have had a great impact on my professional and academic career (I've been using GNU tools and compilers since my undergrad days in the early 1990s). It's good to finally place a face and personality with GNU.<br />The book itself provides a good story on Stallman, but the writing is poor. There are a modest number of typos throughout the book (come on now, couldn't the author have at least run ispell on the document?) as well as a few astounding grammatical errors. Furthermore, the author doesn't do a very good job placing dates with most of his facts. The introduction to the printer incident -- evidently a defining moment in Stallman's life -- is not even given a year. This is important, for the events that methodically unfolded in Stallman's life motivated him greatly. With this in mind, the author fails to convey much time-continuity with his writing; in particular, he shifts back and forth between the present and the past without regard for even stating what year he's discussing. Finally, a short, concise timeline of events as an appendix or something would have been nice.<br />All in all, this is a very good book about Stallman and his motivations for free software. If you've ever used GNU tools, compilers, or GNU/Linux, then you owe it to yourself to read this book and understand how these pieces of software got into your hands.	2003-04-07

The plot was so intricate and involving that it was like watching a movie. Additionally, there is a large amount of foreshadowing throughout the book that will be lost on you with the first reading; do yourself a favour and read it at least twice. The &quot;substory&quot; of the crazed sailor is itself pretty interesting as well.	2003-04-07

I also have &quot;The LaTeX Companion&quot; by Goossens et al., but this book is much more useful to me. At about 170 pages, it crams everything you need into a very short amount of space, including info on fonts, tables, math, formatting, etc. The chapter on large documents was invaluable to me when I was preparing my dissertation. Furthermore, the last chapter has a number of cool macros that have come in pretty handy.<br />Note that this is not a beginner's book on LaTeX, nor does it exhaustively show all the extremely cool bells and whistles that LaTeX can do; this book serves as a concise reference and list of hints and tips for using the key markups. When I write a paper, I like to concentrate on the actual content I'm writing about rather than how to format the text. However, when I do need to format text just right, I turn to this book, and it has never let me down.	2003-03-22

This book isn't for complete newbies though; it seems targeted for those who already have programming experience and just want to get into Java. Myself, I had already had a university education in comp sci (with C and C++) when I picked up his 2nd edition in 1997 and started learning Java. Since then, these books have taught me basic Java semantics, RMI, AWT, applets, I/O, etc. <br />The best characteristic of this book is that it provides fantastic introductions to a wide range of topics; that is, it has great breadth but is otherwise lacking in depth on each topic. That's fine for me, and probably for most experienced programmers, because typically when learning a new topic, I just want a quick start (including what packages to use, how to get it working, and seeing initial results), and if I need a deeper understanding, I'll look online or buy a more focused book. This is how I've learned almost all my Java. Indeed, I recently bought the 5th edition to start learning about server-side technologies like JSP, servlets, and JDBC. It hasn't disappointed me.<br />One chapter I found outstanding is the one on I/O. The number of Java I/O classes is huge as all Java programmers know because the I/O library sacrifices ease-of-use for extreme generality. The author's explanation of when to use which classes is incredibly clear and is perhaps the best of any Java book I've read at giving you the big picture of the I/O library.<br />I really like this author's writing. His explanations are crystal clear. Example: his step-by-step explanation for setting up the Tomcat JSP/Servlet server was excellent (although some key points have been changed by the Tomcat folks since this book was published). This level of clarity probably comes from the fact that the author is a programmerhimself, whereas most of the other intro Java books out there (especially those in the Core...  series) are written by university professors or professional lecturers who try to keep everything extremely general. Such generality is not always helpful. In earlier books, the author seemed to intermingle his dry humour throughout the book, but thankfully he seems to have placed such humour only in isolated areas, such as the anecdotes at the end of each chapter.	2002-12-07
US	52593484	R369EATDZVTSPN	0253208734	950822965	A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (Indiana Series in Arab and Islamic Studies)	Books	5	24	29	N	N	An outstanding book	It has taken me several months to finish off this huge book, but the experience of learning so much has been very rewarding. This is quite simply the best nonfiction book I've ever read, and this on a topic as complex as the Middle East conflict, no less. Tessler's work is completely unbiased and offers an incredibly detailed presentation of the facts up to Fall 1993, after the Oslo accords were announced.<br />Tessler, an American professor, writes in a straight-forward style that is easily understandable. Although the sheer volume of history covered in the book was considerable, I never found myself bored by the writing. I wish my high school history books were written so well.<br />Like a good academian (in the very best sense of the term), he presents the facts clearly. For each historical event, he cites several credible sources stating the event, and for retrospective analysis of its importance, he cites opinions from multiple sides. The build-up to the 1967 war, for example, consumes 20 pages and 50 citations. His use of references is so thorough that of the book's 900+ pages, 93 pages are endnotes.<br />I only have a few minor negative remarks about this book:<br />1. Obviously, since the book was published in 1994, it is not up to date and does not cover the break-down of the negotiations from the Oslo accords. However, historical facts prior to 1993 have not changed (at least not in the Orwellian sense, thank goodness), and this book does an outstanding job for its time frame as I have said.<br />2. There are no photos at all, save for the picture on the cover.<br />3. For a topic so centered on geography, the quality of the maps is surprisingly poor. There are 20 maps showing the important boundaries and such, but these look like they were drawn by a high school art student. A single high-detail, atlas-quality map from 1994 would have been appropriate as well. Instead, I found some colour maps on the web that I printed out and keep folded in the book to use as a quick reference.<br />A much more recent book that I also highly recommend that covers these three points (recentness, photos, and maps) is _The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Crisis in the Middle East_ by Reuters journalists. That book is filled with beautiful photography, nice maps, and is up-to-date to March 2002. It makes a great companion to this book.<br />Overall, this book by Tessler is outstanding. Although its size may be a bit daunting, you will thank yourself for reading this book.	2002-11-22

The maps themselves are fantastic, except for the USA. The problem is that the state boundaries are drawn with such a lightly-coloured red that you can't make them out. Adding to the difficulty is that the major highways are drawn with a dark red,  further obscuring the states. The map of the north-east USA, for example, is practically illegible. This problem doesn't occur for other countries since the US is the only country with so many major internal states. The maps of other continents have a nice thick red line separating countries, which is important for Africa and Europe.<br />It contains a pretty thorough gazetteer, showing the flag and some details of the world's countries (although some info may be out of date by the time you buy this; Afghanistan, for example, is detailed as saying \\"war is raging between the Taliban and the remainder of the government nations\\"). The book also contains small street maps of 20 cities across the world, including NY, Paris, London, Tokyo, etc. but they didn't include Los Angeles, Budapest, Prague, Beijing, Shanghai, or Moscow for some reason (but they do have Amsterdam and Brussels??). The page edges are gilded with a gold-like appearance. Really nice. Since I keep my book in my backpack all the time, I put it in a ziploc bag to keep the gilding from wearing out.<br />Except for the problem with the states of the USA, this is an excellent book due to its appearance and small size. The poorly drawn maps of the USA aren't a big deal to me since I have larger reference atlases at home I use to look up funny little imaginary states like \\"Arkansas.\\"	2002-07-22
