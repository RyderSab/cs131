The art I will give five stars out of five. The coloring, my God, the coloring! The coloring is the best I've ever seen in any comic format in my whole life. John Higgins (the colorist) deserves a credit on the cover with Alan Moore and Brian Gibbons. A wonderful graphic novel which collects a wonderful series.	2004-06-16

Lovecraft: The Road to Madness&quot; was posted on January 10th 1999. The title and review was written as follows:<br />Title:<BR>A true master of the macabre.<br />Review:<BR>My only complaint about the writings of H.P. Lovecraft would be that many of his stories are of a similar nature and theme. Irregardless of this I found most of his stories to be extremely impressive works of fantasy and horror. <br />H.P. Lovecraft is a true past master. If you like anything that has ever dealt with horror, fantasy, or sci-fi, then you would be doing yourself a great disservice to not read a collection of Lovecraft stories at least once in your life.<br />I was very, very impressed by my first encounter with Lovecraft's work. I will read more of his material before my life is over.<BR>End of original review.<br />I am very pleased with my original review and have re-reviewed it to properly put it under my correct name and Amazon.com identity. <br />The only thing new that I would like to add to this re-review would be this: the last story in this collection is called &quot;At The Mountains of Madness.&quot; This story is hands down the best horror story I have ever read in my entire life. Nothing I have read since has equaled it, and nothing ever will. I consider it a profound pleasure that back in 1999 I read a horror story that will stand for the rest of my life as the greatest horror story I have ever read.	2004-03-12

It was nice to re-visit some of my memories from 30 years ago. The art by Wrightson was fantastic! I give it my highest recommendation. The stories by Wein were why this graphic novel got four stars instead of five. The stories were competent but still had plot inconsistencies and pacing problems. I found the stories to be a little to hokey and fake at times - even for a comic book. All in all it was worth the money, four stars out of five usually is.	2004-03-11

When I read certain passages of it at the bookstore I thought it was going to be a fictional narrative of a doomed person's experience in Hell. Instead it was more of an artists explanation about his paintings. The book still drew me in and made me think and feel about what Hell might be like. For this reason, the books ability to make me seriously think about Hell in a literal sense, I will give it four stars.	2004-03-11

I am very dissapointed with volume 2 of \\"The Spirit Archives.\\" The stories were dull and the art was average. Hopefully with the next couple of archives I will start seeing the material that was reprinted by Kitchen Sink Press in the Eighties. The only value this book has is the historical interest of seeing these stories as they appeared sixty years ago. I'm sorry Mr. Eisner, as much as I respect you for being the comic book legend that you are I am just not moved by what I've seen in the first two volumes.	2003-07-12

I bought this book to mainly look at the pictures and thats mainly what I did. The writing of the book was so well done and knowledgable that I read a bit of it also. Before looking/reading at this book I believed that matte paintings were used for primarely sci-fi, fantasy, and other incredible landscape shots. This is not the case as most matte paintings are used for houses, interiors, street scenes, and many other shots that I never would have guessed they were used for. To think that all these years I've been fooled watching so many movies and seeing matte paintings and never even realizing it. An eye opening book to say the least.	2003-07-11

The stories are highly entertaining. There is no reason for me to go on because the preceding reviews say it best - &quot;Hellboy&quot; is fabulous entertainment.

I also read this book because most books tend to be very different than the filmed version. Not so with this book. The movie follows the book almost exactly so when I was reading this it really didn't impress me as much because it was so similar to what I've seen for years. It was still worth reading and I will give it a solid 4 stars out of 5.	2003-02-15

This second outing of the &quot;Mutts&quot; characters wasn't as good as the first book. I still found it to be enjoyable though. It still gave me a cozy warm feeling inside to read the book.

The stories by Stan Lee were juvenile and pre-teen oriented, but I expected this. Kirby's artwork was simply superb! I've read rumblings about the reproduction and how its hurt the inking by Sinnott, but having never seen the originals I can only say that I was impressed even by the inking. If there is a difference between the originals and this reproduction, then I can only imagine how it must have looked. This was a fine trip down memory lane that was well worth the price. Very enjoyable to see stories that were printed about the time that I was born in 1967. Again - stories are pre-teen and juvenile (but I'm a kid at heart so \\"nuff said\\") and artwork and inking by Kirby and Sinnott that is stunning! I got off on this!	2002-09-25

The first volume of \\"Mutts\\" by Patrick McDonnell is simply the best comic strip since \\"Bloom County.\\" This book was touching, funny, and cute. It took me to that special place where life is cozy and beautiful. If Mr. McDonnell can keep this strip going at a high level of quality like this first volume, then I will plan on reading \\"Mutts\\" for the rest of my life.	2002-09-24

This is the first time that I can honestly say that I'm dissapointed by the work of Richard Corben. Corben's artwork was definitly not up to par. The faces of Doc Samson and the Hulk were to cartoonish and out of purportion. The Hulk looked like a big ignorant goofball! <br />The story was [horrid]! Azzarello's story and script was dull and lifeless to say the least. I did not like how Doc Samson was portrayed like a thug. I do not remember him being like that back in my Hulk reading days. I will give this book two stars out of five. The two stars are for the Corben artwork that was interesting to look at, but not for his renderings of Doc Samson and the Hulk. Not worth the read!	2002-09-24

I found the book to get a little slow at times because of the legal storyline, but still a strong five star read. This book really kept me going. If your reading this review and have an interest in people who do terrible acts of violence to other human beings, then I recomend this book. There are actually people out there like Ted Bundy - a true human monster. Scary!	2002-09-24

I wish that I could give this book more than three stars, but I found most of the stories to be quite dull. In fact I skimmed over the majority of the book without really reading it. <br />That being said I know for a fact that greatness is around the corner. I used to read &quot;Spirit&quot; stories when they were published by Kitchen Sink Press in the early 80's. At the time the stories that they reprinted were after Will Eisner had perfected his Spirit creation. Not his early material.<br />I have no regrets for buying this book. I kind of expected the begining to be a little rough and ragged. I bought the book because I wanted to see the true beginings of the Spirit - warts and all. In the next few volumes I expect to see what I remember reading years ago. Wonderful, entertaining stories where a master has found his stride and produces fabulous comic material.	2001-12-06

I found this book to be every bit as enjoyable as the first book (Seed of Destruction). I also found that this book had a couple of weak points to the plot, and in the pacing of the storyline, just like the first book. <br />However, those where the only weak points. The rest of the story was very enjoyable and well crafted. The art is simply stunning. I will continue to read more of &quot;Hellboy&quot; in the future.	2001-11-08

My only problem would be that there was a couple of parts to the story that I found to be weak. Because of this the story could only be very strong instead of awesome. I will follow the adventures of Mike Mignola's &quot;Hellboy&quot; for the rest of my life. <br />This book was so good that I only intended to briefly look it over before I read the second Hellboy collection that I have recently bought. After looking over the first couple of pages I couldn't help myself but to get involved with the story and art all over again. It is very rare that I will re-read a book. This book is so good that I had to do it again.<br />&quot;Hellboy: Seeds of Destruction&quot; is the highest form of what a graphic novel can be. I will rate it five stars. Even with a couple of weak links in the plot it is still material of the highest caliber.	2001-10-18

I only found this book to be average. Maybe if I would have read more &quot;Superman&quot; back in my comic book days I would have enjoyed it more. The story was moderately interesting. The art was above par. For a final &quot;imaginary&quot; Superman story I believe more could have been done. Not bad, but nothing great either. I'll rate it a straight down the middle three stars out of five. Some will think less, others more.	2001-10-11

I did not expect the story to be so interesting and touching though. Captain Marvel visits a bunch of sick children in a hospital and shares with them some of his adventures. <br />I felt like one of the kids in the story as the Captain shares some of his exploits with them. <br />A very touching and enjoyable 5 star read.

It was interesting to look at the photos in this book. However it wasn't as good as many of the other photo books out there that a person could buy. I would recommend that a person go to the bookstore and look at it while there.

The story &quot;The Judges House&quot; by Bram Stoker is the highlight of this book of short stories. Stokers description of the interior of the house as the occupant was studying through the night was very creepy.<br />Other than that the rest of the stories were mostly moderatly interesting.<br />Not a bad book, it just wasn't as good as I like a book of short spooky stories to be.

I knew after the first 10 pages of this graphic novel that the story was not going to interest me one bit. I forced myself to read four or five more pages, and then I had to give it up.<br />I AM NOT SAYING THE STORY WAS BAD. It's just that for some reason I couldn't get interested in it and therefore couldn't read it all the way through. I can't help but get the feeling that if this story was presented in a text only fantasy novel that I might have gotten more out of it. <br />Strange indeed. Most of the time I enjoy sword and sorcery graphic novels. <br />On a more positive note I must praise the black and white artwork of John Bolton. The art was simply fantastic!	2001-07-16

Richard Corben's artwork in this graphic novel is awesome as usual. Corben's art in this book is moody, abstract, and at times surreal. The art matches the story perfectly.<br />I have never read the original version by William Hope Hodgson, but after reading this adaption of it to the graphic novel format, I certainly will.<br />An excellent example of why I will always buy any book with Richard Corben's fantastic artwork.	2001-03-05

As of this book I will now start to buy more art books. <br />I've always had an interest in art books but have never convinced myself to buy one because I couldn't justify buying a book just to look at pictures. That attitude now changes as some of the paintings in this book can keep my looking at them for a significant length of time. <br />Actually taking the time to look at a good artbook is just as rewarding as reading. From this year on I will by the &quot;Spectrum&quot; books as they come out.<br />A fabulous book!	2001-01-18

This was a trip down memory lane that was well worth the price. By far I enjoyed the stories drawn by Jack Kirby - his artwork is awesome! <br />The stories are so basic and simplistic that one only has to browse the narration, no deep reading needed here. But I knew what to expect when I bought this book so I was not disapointed. <br />Basic stories, good Kirby art (on most of the stories), and an enjoyable trip to the beginings of &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot;!	2000-11-04

The first story was &quot;Conan the Magnificant.&quot; It was enjoyable. It was nothing special, but it was certainly a competent short story.<br />I read halfway through the second story collected in this trilogy &quot;Conan the triumphant&quot;, and quit. <br />The reason why is because this story was falling into the same mold of the first one. A competent short fantasy story - but nothing more. Life is to short to spend just on competent short stories. I must move on to other books that will be more enjoyable for me druring my short time on Earth. <br />One final note on the second story; halfway through the story I could easily tell how it was going to end up. All the plot devices and characters were in place. Reading the last 140 pages would just be witnessing the pieces falling into place to wind up the story.<br />I will rate this book 3 stars out of 5. This does not achieve the minimum 4 star rating that in my opinion makes a book worthwhile to read. <br />Skip it unless you like average short fantasy stories about Conan.	2000-10-14

I must admit that as of this collection I am being very careful to buy graphic novels that reprint old stories. The reason why is because past stories very seldom hold my interest like the newer modern stories of comic  art story telling. <br />However, this collection did have value to it for  sentimental reasons. It is interesting to view and skim over stories of   by-gone years. Most of the stories I just skimmed over and didn't read very  thouroughly. The reason why is becuase virtually all of these stories are  so simplistic that you don't need to read them very deeply. <br />I will give  this book 4 stars out of 5. Just barely though, reprints of older stories  are waring thin with me.	2000-07-29

I really had to think about giving this book a 4 star rating. <br />While I found the book to be mostly enjoyable, it was obvious that Mr. McCreary is not an accomplished writer. I also did not like how one of the supporting  characters in the book murders his wife. I found this to be a little to  unbelievable. <br />However, I must admit that the narrative of the serial  killer is quite interesting. It was interesting to hear the mind of someone  who barely feels. Someone who just moves throughout life with hardly any  planning of the future being made. <br />I will give this book 4 stars out of  5. Just barely though.	2000-07-29

What I read I found enjoyable.  Unfortunitaly I have other reading interests (fantasy, horror) that just  don't make it worth my while to read a very long western style book. <br />I  give high praise for James Michener. I'm sure that I will read more of him  in the future. But for now I must put this book aside to focus on other  reading interests that are more enjoyable to my tastes.  <br />&quot;Centennial&quot; is a good book, its just that after reading half  of it I've decided to move on to other things.	2000-07-07

I find it interesting to read old comic stories of the past. Unfortunitaly many of the short sci-fi stories of the 40s, 50s, and 60s that are presented in this volume are just a little to dull  for my tastes. <br />This  collection was by no means bad, it's just that I found most of the stories  collected here to be bland or semi-interesting.<br />Interesting for  sentimental reasons would be a perfect way for me to put it.  <br />I'll rate  it 3 stars out of 5. Based on the Amazon rating system this falls below the  mandatory 4 star level that makes a book a worthwile read. <br />Unless you  have a strong need to revisit past comics of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, then I  would suggest you skip this book.	2000-05-22

I wish I could have enjoyed the &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; books more than I did. There was definitly some funny moments in the three books, but overall I found the humor to be to absurd and abstract to be taken as funny.<br />If you like &quot;Monty Python&quot; material then this book and the first two  may be for you. If your like me and you only find &quot;Monty Python&quot;  to be moderatly funny, then these books may be something to skip.<br />In  summary: I found this third book of the         &quot;Hitchhiker&quot;  adventures to be like the first two installments - sometimes funny and  interesting, but mostly dull and abstract shtick that simply isn't my  style. <br />These books aren't bad, they just aren't all that good either.  The second book in the series - &quot;Resturaunt&quot; - was the best.	2000-03-24

Seeing the Dark Knight in black and white is what made me give this book 5 stars. The black and white artwork was awesome! I must admitt that the short stories were just average, however the artwork saved the short  medicore stories.<br />Well worth the discounted price I paid for it from Bud  Plant Comic Art. A solid 5 star read.	2000-01-17
US	53006657	R2SNJNRF0SB1BM	0345391810	458212829	The Restaurant at the End of the Universe	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An improvement over the first book.	This sequel to &quot;Hitchiker&quot; was more enjoyable than the first book. I did'nt find this book to be as absurd as the first, which is an improvement. I also found myself enjoying the characters more in this book  than the first. Some of the settings and profound situations in this book  where also enjoyable.<br />All in all a solid four star read. A little to  silly and unrealistic at times, but still 4 stars.	1999-12-19

This book did have some moments to it that I really did find enjoyable. Unfortunitaly it had to many more moments that I just found plain boring. <br />I really wanted to enjoy this book more than I did. But even with the  bizarre settings and snappy humor, I still found the main plotline to be  just a little dull. And, some of the events that happened in this storyline  where just to absurd to be taken as humorous. <br />Once again, the book did  have it's moments. But even with flashes of brilliance I still consider the  book to be mildly dull.	1999-11-29

I should have known better than to buy this book, but I just could'nt help myself as I knew the artwork of Russell would be awsome. And it was!<br />Unfortunitalythat was the only good thing about the book.<br />Now dont get me wrong. I'm sure the  original text based stories of Michael Moorcock are awesome. But unfortunitaly any complex translation from text to comic will virtually always leave something to be desired. This was the case with this book. To much story, which works well with text, just cant get crammed into a comic and retain the enjoyability.	1999-09-17
US	53006657	RMPSJ5E8368RQ	0872861554	846358236	Tales of Ordinary Madness	Books	2	6	10	N	N	A complete letdown.	What really amazes me about this book is that it is the second half of a book originally published as one large selection of Bukowski's short stories. I have read the collected first half which is called &quot;The  Most Bueatiful Woman In Town And Other Short Stories&quot; and liked it  emensily. However with this book everything fell apart and I did'nt even  read the last few stories. Strange indeed. I guess my first experience with  Bukowski was fresh and new. Now my second experience was just putting up  with a boring drunk. This could quite probably kill any desire to read more  of Bukowski.	1999-08-21

I have decided to give it a 4 star rating. <br />The story was'nt that spectacular, and neither was the art (which is a letdown from this Corben fan). However,  the story and art were still in the good range. It was a close call, but I  will give this graphic novel a shaky 4 star rating. It was'nt bad.	1999-08-14

It provided what I really like to see in a graphic novel: fantastic art and a good storyline. <br />I will definitly read more of the &quot;Mercenary.&quot; A solid 5 star read!	1999-08-14

As the one line summary above says, the book can be a little long and tedious at points, but still an overall 4 star read.<br />I must admit that the desire for the story to end really started to hit me at about the last  300 pages. So at this point I started to skim the last part of the book.  Fortunatily by this point all of the major plot points where well in place  so by skimming the last 300 pages I was able to conclude the book and still  get satisfaction out of the reading experience.	1999-07-18

This book closely resembles the work of Sergio Aragons who makes strips without words that still carry a story. <br />An interesting book. Nothing classic, but still an interesting concept.	1999-07-18
US	53006657	R31XCVIOM8E9Y	0962384119	970596185	Rip in Time	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A very rare weak performance from Corben.	My main problem with the book is that it was'nt published in color. For Richard Corben material this is a major sin. I have no reason why it was'nt published in color, but even in black and white corben's art is superb.  <br />The secondary problem would be that of Bruce Jones's story. This is  definitly not one of his best offerings to go along with Corben's  artwork.<br />If the book would have been published in color I'm sure I would  have given it a 5 star rating because of Corben's breathtaking color art.  However, with this effort in black and white, and the weak story (which  could have been overcome with color art) the best I can give is 3 stars out  of 5.	1999-05-13

After reading &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; I knew that I was going to read more of Raymond Chandler. After reading this book I know that I will continue to read even more.<br />A very interesting and entertaining crime  yarn. I will give it the 5 star rating.	1999-03-30

It did have it's moments, but overall it was an average to dull read. I only paid 5 bucks for this book, so at that price it was a good value. Pay any more and your certainly wasting your money.	1999-03-17

This book could have been five stars, but I got bored of hearing Louis consistantly wine about his vampire nature once he became one. <br />At the same time, if Louis would have just accepted his vampire nature as that of  a killer (which is all that vampires are according to the book), then I  don't suppose there would have been much of a story to read.<br />At any rate,  Louis was a complete sniveling wimp. I have nothing about a man being  poetic and a romantic, but one can take it to far, as Louis did.	1999-03-14

US	53006657	R37ELONFH5U4F3	0517887290	114266213	Fingerprints of the Gods	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A fun alternate history book that does have some facts.	This was a fun book to read. It did point out to me something that I never really thought of before - that is that there are megalithic stone structures on all continents of the world, and they all date to an ancient  past.<br />Curious stuff! <br />Be forwarned: the hypothesis that the continental  plates have all locked together and shifted in the past 10,000 years to  wipe out past advanced civilizations is bogus. While a complete shifting of  the Earth's entire crust is possible, the most fundamental and reliable  current geological data show this clearly did not happen in the past 10,000  years.<br />It's still a five star read and I recomend it.	1999-02-06

With this book I was finally able to say goodbye to the religous fairy tales that I was never able to feel comfortable with. With this book  I was finally able to accept that if there is a God, that it is a God that  neither I, or anyone, has ever heard of.<br />Like it or not we are primates.  This book clearly shows why and how. Live life to the fullest!	1999-02-04

It will not be my last!<br />I absoloutly loved this book.

The only reason this book gets two stars is because of Miller's artwork. And, as far as I'm concerned, his artwork is vastly  overrated.<br />Miller's best work continues to be his classic run on the  &quot;Daredevil&quot; comic book series which I had the pleasure to read  back in my comic days. If they ever collect those stories in a graphic  novel format, then you will see Miller at his best.	1999-02-02
