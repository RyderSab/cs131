The love story is less interesting.  Raphael, never before in love, falls for Margherita, a baker's daughter on sight - drawn by her spirit and independence.  Onoce they become involved though, the most she does is hang out in places/with things he buys her, making love to him and swooning \\"Amore Mio, Rafaello\\" and becomes much less interesting, so you wonder what the heck is this love story of the century really all about? <br /> <br />Read the Illuminator instead - much more interesting from start to finish	2005-10-14

The author here has an uncanny ability to describe precisely certain emotions in a way that no one else can.  The story is good but the writing and the author's uncanny knack of delving into and putting into words people's motivations, psyches and mindsets is the most interesting aspect of this book	2005-09-03

It's an enjoyable read but not as good as her earlier books.  Read to Darkness and to To Death for fun and for grittier reading, check out the new novels Val McDermid and/or Karin Slaughter have written for their series.	2005-06-29

Instead, it comes off like a college kid's composition paper, trying to sound grown-up with an eye towards having the absolute most similes and metaphors per page ever.  If you get past the pretentiousness and find this debut author a new editor, she should be very good.	2005-02-08

The first book was funny - this started out that way but at the end it was a chore to read. Try Jennifer Crusie or Jane Heller for more laughs or Carly Phillips or Rachle Gibson for strong heroines.	2003-10-23

In fact, the plot was interesting, the concepts were good and the method of murder something I have never heard of in real life or in books so that was intriguing.  The writing style is not that great, conversations are sometimes hard to follow and some scenes seem repetitive and the pace could have been picked up. Also the heroine is imbued with too much goodness : the &quot;native Block Islanders&quot; are described as keeping to themselves yet they take to her immediately?  And can she really cure an alcoholic by meeting him?? <BR>All in all the author has great ideas and shows great promise but needs a better editor.	2003-09-11

Still reading Elinor Lipman is a real treat!  her conversations and characters are great and so real - the lines from the men in this book and  &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; are ones I can actually see coming out of the mouths of some men I have met.  Even if this particular book didn't hook you, read another one or two and you will fall in love with Elinor Lipman's writing!	2003-09-11

The book IS funny but it also is heartbreaking at times, and teaches a lot about self-image and self-acceptance, loss and working through it, and learning to trust again. This is one of the best books I have read all year and can't wait for Ms. Weiner to write some more novels.	2002-04-22

The Pixie tricks manual at the end, to fill in, made  it interactive and she is really enjoying that as well.  Not since the Bill  Wallace Books and the June B Jones books has she liked a set of books so  much.  I highly recommend it and cannot wait for the next group to come  out!	2000-06-26

I have not seen many books that give us an idea of what Henry V was like as a child, a lovr, a soldier. a  man, and finally as a fallible and human king.  <br />Now, to  counterbalance it a little (since the author really DOES tend, in my  opinion,to indulge in a little hero worshipping of Henry), I am reading  Edith Pargeter's &quot;A Bloody Field at Shrewsbury&quot; which gives   different and more favorable views of Henry IV and Henry  &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy. <br />For another view of the world as it was at  this time, one might also try the Stewart trilogy by Nigel Traneter,  focusing on Scottish (and by necessity, French, Irish and English) politics  of the day.  Nigel Tranter books get five stars from em every time!<br />You  will, however, get your money's worth from this book and enjoy it very  much.	2000-02-23

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though the size of it was daunting at first! (I liked it so much so that my sis got it for Christmas last year - I was that sure that anyone who picked up up would enjoy it!) Don't forget  to try CLeopatra - the book is wonderful and don't get swayed by the ABC  movie and lackluster acting.  Mary Queen of Scots, while well written, is  probably the weakest, simply because for a good part of her life Mary was  shunted from place to place while being held captive in England.	1999-09-17

I went through this book in one day and loved it - my only regret is that I have to wait until Part 2 comes out!  I wish other bioggraphical novels were written in this manner - it was was easy and exicting to read and I  learned a lot.  The only comparable one (in style) has been the diary of  Anne Boleyn, which I expect is not as factually correct.  I would love to  see Margerat George write about her as well!	1999-08-01
