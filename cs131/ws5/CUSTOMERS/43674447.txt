The solution came completely out of left field; Mr. Baldacci never lets on who the villian is until the final showdown.  Keep up the good work; can't wait until your next book.  By the way, would like to read more about Mr. King and Ms. Maxwell.	2003-12-04

This is a page turner with lots of twists and turns.  I normally don't give a novel five stars, but this deserves it.  &quot;Burn Factor&quot; was the first of Mr. Mills' books I read and have not been disappointed in any of them; however, &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot; is the one I have enjoyed the most.<br />Mr. Mills:  keep up the good work.	2003-04-16

There are lots of twists and turns with an almost complete surprise ending.  I will admit I was starting to suspect the true villin about 1/2 to 3/4 through, but it didn't detract from my reading enjoyment.  Let me warn you though, this is a one sitter -- you will not be able to put it down.  Mr. Child:  keep up the good work.	2003-03-11

US	43674447	ROM51ZRMDI1WY	074343675X	917856051	Path of the Assassin: A Thriller	Books	3	1	2	N	Y	Enjoyable Thriller	This is Mr. Thor's second novel and it's a breakneck ride from the first sentence to the last period.  I was exhausted by the time I reached the last page.  I thoroughly enjoyed his \\"The Lions of Lucerne\\" and pre-ordered \\"Path of the Assassin\\".  Mr. Thor's second novel, while still good, is not as good as \\"Lions\\".  Hopefully, Mr. Thor's next installment in the life of hero, Scot Harvath, will have a little more plot and a lot less testosterone.  There was a little too much verbage about how much smarter, tougher, and more heroic Mr. Havath was than anyone else in government service (this is what stopped me from giving four stars).  We accept this; just get on with the story.  <br />This is still a good thriller -- and it's one thrill after another.  The story line was right on and liked the twists and turns.  Also liked the heroine and the fact she can keep up with Mr. Havath; hope to see more of her.  Looking forward to the next installment.	2003-02-27
US	43674447	R1V97CR0K19UOL	0451410602	525614539	Deaths Door	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Top Notch Thriller	Michael Slade just keeps getting better and better.  Can't wait for the next installment in the fight between DeClercq and arch villian, Mephisto.  It is bloody and sadistic, but that is the nature of the villian -- someone who knows no restrait in his desire for the ultimate pleasure and we don't know yet what that is.  You can see Mephisto going deeper and deeper into evil and DeClercq and crew doing their best to stop him.  Couldn't put down and rates five stars (I normally don't give more than four).	2003-01-14
US	43674447	R178RPWRQYU4W9	0804115435	668170725	Pursuit	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Excellent Thriller	Received this Thomas Perry thriller this week and read it in almost one sitting -- without skipping!!!  Both main characters tread the fine line between being hero and villian; however, you clearly know which one is the \\"hero\\".  The hero, Roy Prescott, is called in by a criminalist to pursue a serial/contract killer.  Mr. Prescott's background is very murkey; is he a reformed bad guy or a back-slidden good guy?  Hope we hear more about Mr. Prescott (if that's his real name) in future books.<br />I don't normally rate any book five stars; this one deserves it.	2003-01-10

The story is about a woman trying to run a ranch alone while fighting off the tall, dark, handsome, and single rancher who wants her land.  To add danger to the plot, there is the frightening ex-husband who wants her back under any circumstances.  I enjoyed this book.	2002-09-30

Mr. Haig writes exciting legal thrillers with a touch of humor.  The hero, Sean Drummand, is a JAG lawyer with an unusual past (commando in a super secret Army squad).  Mr. Haig is now one of my must read authors.  Even though each novel stands on its own, my recommendation is to read them in order.  &quot;Secret Sanction&quot; is his first book.	2002-09-09

Ms. Howard's heroine is a butler/body guard and from there the story gets better.  The villian is a kinky killer (yeah) and the hero is a good balance to the heroine (he can eat crackers in my bed).  You will not be disapointed.	2002-07-28

You should read this series in order; even though each one stands on its own, the stories make more sense.<br />&quot;Games of the Hangman&quot; is slow starting, but once it gets going, it doesn't stop until you close the book.  It is well worth the money and the search for this out-of-print book.	2002-07-28

The heroine is a fire marshal new on the job, so we are dealing with sexism as well as a villian doing terrible things with fire.

Please, Mr. Gordon, write another.  My normal read is gory mystery thrillers, so this was quite a departure.
