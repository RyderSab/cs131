The late Professor Winks and Professor Kaiser have produced a gem of a book for the student historian. Europe, during the period covered by this book, saw a vast amount of change. England disposed of its royalty only to reinstate it, with Charles II, France became a republic, new lands/cultures were being discovered, the age of enlightenment was born and the industrial revolution occurred. Newton was discovering gravity, Voltaire was writing, Gainsborough painting and Haydn composing. The authors have covered all of these topics, and more, in a readable way that isn't weighted down with heavy prose. There are many illustrations scattered throughout which add to the enjoyment of this book.<br /><br />At a mere 199 pages it is not a text that covers any of these events in any great depth, but what it does do is to give a good introduction to them. Although concise it is not lacking relevant information. After reading this book, the student should have enough knowledge to discuss the important historiographical points from the era. The numerous references point the reader to other texts that will expand their knowledge should they need to. This is an excellent addition to the bookshelf.	2005-10-12
US	48281475	R3LEVJPXPFUYGT	006250049X	702123266	Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts	Books	3	17	25	N	N	Well written but very one sided view of the witch-hunt	This is a book that focuses on the witch-hunt from the female perspective. Ms Barstow writes well and with a nice fluent style that makes history readable rather than `dusty' or `dry'. There is no doubt she paints a vivid picture of the witch craze in early modern Europe and there are references that point to further reading for those who are interested.<br />However the author writes from an extremely feminist viewpoint which I found a little overpowering (and I class myself as a feminist). Her prologue focuses on violence against women in modern society and uses that as a comparison for what happened in the witch hunt. There is scant attention paid to the fact that 20% of those accused of witchcraft were men, a significant number. Indeed, in Eastern Europe there were more men accused than women.<br />Whilst there is no doubt that some misogyny came into play during that time, and that there were awful consequences for women accused of being witches, I would have liked a more balanced view of the witch-hunt rather than one that assumed all judges, witch finders and jailers were sexually abusive toward the (female) accused. The author particularly criticises the notoriously misogynystic `Malleus Maleficarum' whilst seemingly oblivious to the fact she is as guilty of sexism as the authors of that book were.<br />Ms Barstow does refer to the work of many eminent historians who have written on this topic, but seems to find fault in all of their findings, giving the impression that she is the only one with a `realistic' view of what the witch-hunt was about. This is quite a useful book for the undergraduate studying this period, so long as they balance it with plenty of other reading matter rather than taking this as a definitive text.	2005-10-12

As a core text for my history degree, this book provided an excellent introduction to the English reformation. Shiels, an historian/lecturer with a particular interest in this era, has given a clear, concise background to the reformation; looking at the causes of it and the impact it had on the church and on the population. He takes the reader through the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward, Mary and ends with the early reign of Elizabeth. We see that the reformation was already gathering momentum long before Henry decided he wanted a divorce.<br /><br />As would be expected from a book of this ilk, there are plenty of references which allows the reader to move onto further study should they so wish. At 128 pages you would be forgiven for thinking this book was too brief for serious study but in fact it packs a wealth of knowledge into its pages. The downside of this text is that it is, at times, a little too dry. This probably makes it unsuitable for the casual reader but, for the student it is an invaluable addition to the bookshelf.	2005-10-01
US	48281475	R2WD2FIUWMOOLB	1841492701	77827019	Unto Leviathan	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Science fiction as it should be.	This is a story written in the first person and written from the perspective of Bartolomeo, a man who is a misfit amongst the inhabitants of The Argonos, a massive spaceship that is trawling the galaxy in search of new life. Generations of humans have been raised on the ship and very few have ever had the opportunity to step on solid ground. Bartolomeo is a loner, brought up by various members of the `upper levels', never knowing his parents and suffering from various physical disabilities. His only `friend' is the Captain of the ship. So far, no evidence of extra terrestrial life has been found until the Argonos stumbles on a seemingly deserted alien craft drifting in space. Bartolomeo is chosen to lead an exploration team to investigate this strange ship in spite of opposition from the sinister Bishop, leader of the Church on the Argonos.<br /><br />Richard Paul Russo has written an excellent tale, fast paced enough to keep the interest going but in depth enough to give a satisfying read. His alien craft is truly alien, unlike so many sci-fi stories that have the universe populated with humanoid life. The feeling of menace on the deserted craft is almost palpable. The one small criticism that could be levelled at this book is that the characterisation is not terribly strong, but, with such a strong storyline, this can be forgiven. All in all, a very good debut book, well worth a look.	2005-09-13
US	48281475	R2OJ602IHD7SH6	0385175809	930626996	Magician	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Epic fantasy.	Magician is the first book in Raymond E Feist's epic Riftwar series. Set primarily on the world of Midkemia, a medieval, rural type world, the story centres on two boys, Pug and Tomas. Pug's ambition is to be a magician whilst Tomas wants only to become a soldier. All is going well in their lives until war erupts, changing the boys' lives forever. The twist in this tale is that the invaders are from another world, a place called Kelewan that is medieval Chinese in style, populated by a harsh and cruel race. They have discovered a rift in space/time that allows them to cross to Midkemia where they cause havoc, murdering and enslaving the Midkemians. Naturally, as with all fantasy books, the two youngsters are, in their differing way, to become heroes and to save the day. One criticism could be that there is not much detail given regarding Kelewan but Feist (along with Janny Wurts) has brought out the Empire trilogy which is a series set on that world. For anyone wanting that extra information, they will find those books a real treat.<br />This book seems (judging by previous reviews) to be one that you will either love or hate. Many have tried to compare it to Tolkein whilst others belittle that view. It certainly isn't Tolkein, but is an original and interesting book in its own right. Sure, many of the staples of fantasy are there such as elves and dwarfs, swords and sorcery etc. but there is enough originality in this book to make it a very worthwhile read.<br />This is a big book to read (in the USA it has now been split into two volumes) but don't let that put you off, it's not so heavyweight that it becomes a chore to read, nor so lightweight it becomes boring. It's certainly worth the time of any lover of fantasy fiction.	2005-07-20

This little book is stuffed full of `female' facts from the fascinating, through to the weird and wonderful.  There are eleven chapters that deal with topics such as wardrobe, love, sporting life, animal kingdom, food and celebrities.<br /><br />Anyone who loves trivia will find a wealth of facts to enjoy, from the origins of soap (thousands of years old...and did you know soap was found in the ruins of Pompeii?) through to the fact that Queen Christina of Sweden was so afraid of fleas that she had a miniature cannon constructed for her bedroom. The said cannon fired miniature cannonballs at the offending mites! Or did you know that you could be arrested for falling asleep in the bathtub in Detroit or that it's illegal to buy peanuts after sundown in Alabama? These are just a few of the myriad snippets to be found between the covers of this little gem.<br /><br />This is a book you can dip into whenever the whim takes you rather than a book you will read cover to cover and it will provide no end of fun facts for you to fascinate your friends with.

US	48281475	R2TJ6NGX7RASON	0785818588	695627284	Witch Hunt: History of a Persecution	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Interesting but a little too graphic.	This book is different from the majority of books covering this subject in that it doesn't just concentrate on British witch hunts or the infamous Salem witch trials. Instead it features a more general, international view of the subject and in doing so gives a far better insight into just how widespread the belief in, and fear of witchcraft was in early modern Europe. There are chapters covering the problem in France, Germany, Scandinavia, Spain, Italy and Ireland. The author also includes a list of further reading which is useful.<br />Nigel Cawthorn has a nice, easy style of writing that makes reading this text more enjoyable. The downside of this book is that it is a little too graphic at times. It is enough to know that the poor unfortunates accused of witchcraft were often tortured and executed, without having every detail described.<br />The book loses a star as there is the occasional inaccuracy in Cawthorns historiography which takes a little credibility away. Overall though, an interesting read that is worth a look.	2005-06-06

He starts by looking at the definition of witchcraft, something that is not often approached in other books of this type.<br /><br />From there, the book studies topics such as the gender issue. It is commonly assumed that witches are usually female but the author dispels that myth and provides statistical evidence showing 25% of accused or executed witches in Europe were in fact male. He goes on to discuss witchfinders (e.g. the infamous Matthew Hopkins) and witch cures, the influence of enmity between neighbours/kin that could lead to false accusations and addresses the issue of mental illness, a topic that is often ignored in other studies of this subject. A well written conclusion pulls all this information together.<br /><br />As would be expected from a book of this type, an extensive bibliography and list of further reading is included. Although this book can be a little heavy going at times, it is an invaluable sourcebook for undergraduates studying history and probably one of the best to be found on this subject.	2005-06-06

Wegs and Ladrech have presented history in a lively, interesting style that manages to avoid a tendency to be dull or `dry'. The book follows a logical order from the end of World War 2 and the consequent rise of the Superpowers, through to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. All important aspects of this period are covered such as economic recovery in Western Europe, the end of the Eurocentric order, the Cold War, Eastern and Western European politics, post war society and the student riots of the 1960's. The final two chapters in the book cover culture and thought in Europe and a look toward the 21st century.<br /><br />In the introduction, the authors freely state they have `favoured conciseness over excessive attention to detail'. In being concise however, the authors have merely avoided excessive, over detailed prose and have not omitted essential detail. This is a work that should prove invaluable to students of this era.	2005-06-04

The book is divided into 5 sections which makes navigation of the subject matter easier.<br /><br />Section 1 deals with the period 1870-1902 and focuses on topics such as the retreat of industrial revolution, persistence of mass poverty, the myths and reality of Victorian values and the rise of the Labour movement.<br /><br />Section 2 covers Edwardian social reforms, class struggle, invasion scares, and the impact of war to name but a few of its themes and it spans the years 1902-1918.<br /><br />In section 3, 1918-1940, Pugh explores such issues as the legacy of war, Labours rise to power, social welfare, the housing revolution and Keynesianism.<br /><br />Section 4 (1940-1970) looks at the `Age of the Benign State', and covers such topics as race and immigration, collapse of British power, the permissive society, decolonisation and Britain's reluctant entry into Europe.<br /><br />The final section discusses multi-party politics, the decline of Labour, Thatcherism, the increase of environmentalism and economic depression and ends in 1997.<br /><br />There are tables and figures, some illustrations and a useful guide to further reading for those who wish to explore the subject further. This text should be very useful to undergraduates but would also appeal to anyone with an interest in British history. It is easy to read although admittedly a little `dry' at times but is full of relevant information and provides enough `in depth' information for even the most exacting of readers.	2005-06-04
US	48281475	R2OYZWOQXX5BQC	0812536037	761340975	Songs of Earth And Power	Books	5	6	6	N	N	How fantasy should be.	Originally two separate books, Greg Bear's `Infinity Concerto' and `The Serpent Mage' are brought together in one volume renamed `Songs of Earth and Power'.<br /><br />The story revolves around Michael Perrin, a young poet who is searching for meaning in his life but with no direction. When he befriends Arno Waltiri an elderly neighbour who is also artistic (a composer), it is a meeting of minds and Michaels life changes forever. Unfortunately Arno dies soon after meeting Michael but leaves him a key to an old abandoned house. What Michael is about to discover is that this house is a gateway to another realm, the Realm of the Sidhe, a realm that is both compelling and dangerous, a realm that is difficult to escape from.<br /><br />Greg Bear's land of elves is not the pretty, enchanted place of so many fantasy novels but is an oppressive, menacing land of cruelty and fear, ruled by the unfeeling Sidhe. His brilliantly descriptive narrative draws the reader in until you feel part of this world. It is a difficult book to put down. Songs of Earth and Power isn't an easy or comfortable read but it is one that is well worth the effort. It's definitely one of the better novels in the fantasy genre and it's a great addition to the bookshelf of any lover of fantasy.	2005-05-21

This is a pocket sized book with a title that implies it offers a brief overview of the Cold War but make no mistake, there is nothing lacking in this little gem. Starting with World War II and the destruction of the old Eurocentric world order, the book progresses to the origins of the Cold War, through developing problems in South East Asia, the rise of the Superpowers and finally ends with the fall of Communism in the former USSR.<br /><br />There are many illustrations and some useful maps along with a very useful chapter pointing to further reading for anyone wishing to extend their knowledge of the subject. This book contains more than enough information to give a good grounding in the subject, not only for the casual reader but also for the student. It may be a `very short introduction' but it is an extremely thorough one.	2005-05-20

Since the fall of Communism in the U.S.S.R. she is reduced to cleaning office floors and dreaming of building a new life in Canada. Ilya Muromyets is a drug addict who wishes only for death. Unfortunately for him he is immortal, one of the Russian `Heroes' of folk tales, and he cannot die except at the hands of another immortal but he's the only one of his kind left.<br /><br />Elena finds a strange object, a small ball that seems to absorb light, the scientist in her wonders what its purpose is. Ilya is approached by the representative of a mysterious organisation and is asked to find this artefact. Eventually Elena and Ilya come together and learn just what this object and its purpose are.<br /><br />Nine Layers of Sky is one of those rare books in the sci-fi genre in that it is actually 'different'. Liz Williams has proven, with this latest novel, that she is not a `one trick pony' and can write an original story that is fast paced and absorbing. Her style can be a little dark and oppressive at times but that suits her stories and in no way detracts from them. It's not a style that will please everyone but for anyone looking for something different, they would go a long way to find better than this.	2005-05-15

Bob Eggleton's artwork not only shows what an amazingly gifted artist he is but also demonstrates a breathtaking imagination. As the title of the book indicates, this is a book featuring paintings of alien landscapes, wonderful spacecraft and alien beings. It is hard to believe such detail has come purely from imagination and that these are not something the artist has seen in reality. With vibrant colours and perfection in even the minutest details these are pictures that a reader will want to look at time and time again. This is a wonderful book not only for fans of science fiction and fantasy but also for anyone who appreciates art.	2005-05-15

Again, the main story centres on the young novice Sonea who is now well through her apprenticeship at the Magicians Guild. Although she has had a rough time with her fellow novices and the teachers, who initially looked down on her because of her upbringing in the slums, Sonea is making progress and is even developing some friendships. All this changes when she discovers the true reason that her guardian, the High Lord Akkarin, is practicing black magic. Sonea has to decide whether to help Akkarin and risk losing everything she has worked for and possibly even risk her life. Meanwhile a threat has arisen from the outcasts of a land where black magic is openly practiced. These outcasts have realised that the magicians of the Guild are weaker than they had thought and have one aim...to oust the magicians and take over Imardin.<br /><br />Like the previous books in this trilogy, `The High Lord' is a very readable story that is fast paced enough to keep interest going. Canavan hasn't produced the most original of ideas but nonetheless her style of writing, and the characterisation she has produced, makes this a very enjoyable read. She has also been brave enough not to fall into the trap of a neat, happy ending but has dared to be different.	2005-05-15

During one of the annual Purges, performed by magicians on the Kings orders, to clear the beggars and vagrants from the slums, Sonea discovers she has the power of magic. Only the Magicians are allowed to practice this craft and Sonea does not belong to their group. In fear of her life, she goes into hiding helped by her friend Ceryni and the Thieves who live under the city. Whilst hiding her, the Thieves hope Sonea will develop her powers and will eventually be of use to them.<br /><br />Meanwhile the magicians are searching day and night to find this 'rogue magician'. What they know, and Sonea and her friends don't, is that untrained, a magicians powers will become uncontrollable and eventually destroy the magician and all around them. A race against time begins.<br /><br />Trudi Caravan has produced a book that is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a work that will tax the brain. However it is still a very enjoyable read and one that you find yourself caught up in and unwilling to put down.	2005-04-21

She is the first poor person to have been admitted to this elitist establishment. Although she is gifted and has the support of the magician Lord Rothen, very few of the teachers and none of the other novices are at all pleased she is there. Sonea herself is reluctant to be there having been raised with sight of magicians `purging' the slums of the poor every year. She still believes they are essentially uncaring at best and evil at worst. Rothen has his work cut out to gain the young woman's trust and to teach her control of her power.<br /><br />One novice in particular, Regin, who is jealous of Sonea's stronger power and hates her 'lowly' status, makes it his life's mission to make Sonea's life a misery and turn everyone against her. The situation becomes even worse when she comes to the High Lord Akkarin's notice and he takes over her guardianship. Sonea both fears and hates Akkarin after discovering he practices black magic, something that the Guild views as the worst crime of all and punishable by death. Everyone else sees her position as the High Lord's favourite as a privilege but she knows he is only keeping her near him in order to ensure she doesn't betray his secret.<br /><br />Trudi Canavan's second book in the 'Black Magician' trilogy is as engrossing as the first and will certainly whet the appetite for the final book. She has created three dimensional characters that the reader actually comes to care about. Although the trilogy may not feature the most original of themes, the writing and story telling quality certainly make it a worthwhile read.	2005-04-21

There were around 12 years between books 2 and 3 being published so don't hold your breath for book 4.That aside, these are lightweight stories but still entertaining and worth reading.<br /><br />Elvenbane is a tale of the struggle between 'half bloods' and Elves. The lordly elves rule the land with savage brutality. Humans are their slaves and viewed as little better than animals. Occasionally half bloods (a mixture of elf and human) are born. These are feared by the elves due to their strong magical powers, and are usually destroyed as soon as they are born.<br /><br />Shana, the heroine of the tale, is one such half blood. Born in the desert to a mother who died giving birth, Shana is found and fostered by a dragon. No one knows dragons exist until Shana, following her fate as the 'Elvenbane' calls on them for help in the battle against Elves.

Not so...the rise of consumerism throughout the modern world has shown an enormous shift in social attitudes and values. Any student of social history would be advised to read this book in order to gain a valuable insight into the mind of the modern man (or woman).<br /><br />Stearns has shown how modern society judges its own self worth and that of its neighbours by the possessions it has and how buying the 'right label' bestows you with status. Of course, throughout the poorer sections of society and in poorer countries, it is a struggle to buy enough to live on let alone increase status.<br /><br />This book has chapters looking at various different nations approach to consumerism, such as the Islamic Middle East, Russia, Asia and so on. It also examines the darker side of the massive rise in consumerism and its negative impact on some sections of society.<br /><br />All in all a fascinating book both for the historian and the social scientist.

To enter Larson's world is to enter a world where animals have meaningful conversations, bugs make their homes in nice suburban houses, flies fly planes etc, etc. Certainly not the mainstream kind of cartoon but for anyone who likes 'off the wall' type humour this is a 'must buy'. Absolutely hilarious.	2005-03-11

Czerneda's 'Web Shifters' trilogy. Esen is the youngest of her kind, a web consisting of only six of these shape shifters in the known universe. Although several hundred years old, by the standards of her kind she is merely a child. Like a child, she tends to get into scrapes very easily.<br /><br />The 'web' has a cardinal rule, that no-one must know of their existence. This hasn't been difficult up to now as the web are all shape shifters and able to take on any form they wish in order to study other species while keeping their existence secret. However, Esen managed to break that rule when Paul Ragem, a human, discovers her abilities.<br /><br />This is a lightweight book; there is no hard science to baffle the reader. It is more a story of the development of a youngster and her attempts to form relationships. Recommended for a quick, enjoyable read.	2005-03-11

Kelewan is an oriental type world, very reminiscent of feudal Japan, where protocol is paramount. The 'Great Game of Council' is the Kelewanese idea of politics and it is this game that governs the Great Houses, deciding who will survive, who will fall and who will rise.<br />Mara of Acoma is the 'daughter' of the title. Brought up in a world dominated and ruled by men, Acoma finds herself, after the death of her father and brother, having to battle for her honour and for her people in a battle of wits against her brutal husband and in the 'Game of the Council'.<br />Raymond Feist, partnered with Janny Wurts has produced a masterpiece of fantasy that will surely become a classic. This is a well written book with enough description to absorb the reader but without getting 'bogged' down in too much minutiae. The authors have created a believable world populated with believable characters, not always an easy task. Although this trilogy follows on from the Riftwar series, it can be read alone, there is no necessity to have read the Riftwar books first. This book is a 'must have' on the bookshelves of any fantasy fan.	2005-03-11

Bridget Lederle takes care of the lighthouse on an island in one of the Great Lakes. She leads a lonely life being an outcast from the local community after having had an illegitimate baby who died soon after birth. One night she saves a mysterious stranger from a storm. The stranger claims he is a sorcerer from a place 'beyond the land of death' and he wants to take Bridget back with him. With nothing to keep her on Sand island and with a compulsion she cannot understand, Bridget follows Kalami back to his home of Isavalta where her the story really begins and she finds out more about her past than she could ever have dreamed of.<br /><br />Sarah Zettle, known for her science fiction writing, has proved, with this first book in the Isavaltan trilogy, that she is as capable of producing outstanding fantasy as she is sci-fi. This is fantasy at its best and manages to be that rare beast, an original story in a genre where there are so many tales that are just a variation on a theme.	2005-03-11

Although the book is divided into 'bite sized chunks', make no mistake; this is no lightweight read. Gregory Freeze has an obvious grasp of the enigma that is Russia and has the skill to present his knowledge in a way that makes complex history fun to read instead of a chore.<br /><br />The revised edition takes into account the information that has become available since the fall of Communism in the USSR. This makes it all the more interesting as it helps dispel some of the myths propagated by the West during the cold war. I would recommend this book to anyone with a fascination for Russia but particularly for the undergraduate studying the topic.	2005-03-11

Although that seems strange at first, it actually works really well.<br /><br />This time the story revolves around Bridget Lederle's parents, again the story moves between Earth and Isavalta, a land of magic and intrigue. To get there Ingrid Loftfield must follow the sorcerer Avanasy across the land of Death and Spirit.<br /><br />This is a highly enjoyable read that is skilfully written. Sara Zettle is proving as competent a writer of fantasy as she is of sci-fi.	2005-03-11

This was bought as a gift for me and what a prezzie it turned out to be. This first book in the 'Last Rune' series starts in a backwater town in Colorado where Travis Wilder runs a bar. Everything in his life is humdrum and normal but that is about to change with the arrival of a strange travelling show, headed by Brother Cy. At the same time there is a parallel story about a young doctor, Grace Beckett who feels there is something lacking in her life. She is about to find out what.<br /><br />Mark Anthony has produced an excellent introduction to a series that moves between Earth and Eldh (a medieval type world). He creates an atmospheric tale that manages to be original and engrossing. His characters have depth and facets to them that make the reader care about them. Highly recommended for any fantasy fan or lover of a good story.	2005-02-12

Although the trilogy was never going to be a heavyweight of literature, the first two books did at least provide enough of a story to keep the interest going and provide a good light sci-fi read.<br /><br />Esen is a shape shifter but no one outside of her small 'web' of shifters must know this. In book one Esen becomes 'orphaned' after the other 5 members of her web are killed leaving her the only one of her kind left. The first and second book tell the story of Esen and the fight she has to survive and yet keep her true identity secret from all but the one friend she has made in the whole universe.<br /><br />Unfortunately book three is yet more of the same and is repetitive. It's not that it's a terrible book or badly written...more that it feels like the author has run out of steam somewhat. If you have read the other 2 books you may want to read this purely to tie up a couple of loose ends but be warned, it isn't nearly as good as the others.	2005-02-12

There are numerous useful primary sources, documents, posters, all presented in a concise, easily understood format. That's not to say Welch has simplified or 'dumbed down' historical facts, on the contrary, he has managed to pack this book with a remarkable depth of information.<br /><br />All major areas of this period are covered, from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and its eventual demise through to the World Wars and beyond. The Russian revolution is examined as is the rise of Nazi Germany. Highly recommended for any student of this period.	2005-02-12

Set on the world of Latent Emanations, the story revolves around the alchemist Alivet. Her sister has been taken by the Lords of the Night and Alivet's mission is to find and help her.<br />After she is framed for murder, Alivet finds herself on the run, helped by the mysterious 'Poison Master' who seems to have plans of his own for the young alchemist. Having taken her to his own world, the poison master has Alivet kept in his own house and, for most of the time, under lock and key. Alivet begins to fear that she will never return home, and may even become a victim of her hosts' skills when she has outlived her usefulness.<br />Although no heavyweight of literature, this book is certainly worth a look if you fancy something other than the usual sword and sorcery type fantasy. A good read for anyone who likes something a little different.	2005-02-12

This book claims to be the true story of a Saudi princess and her lifestyle. If it is true then it is a harrowing indictment of an inhuman attitude towards Saudi women. Particularly disturbing is the account given of the poor girl murdered by her father, in front of all her family, for bringing 'shame' on them. The lack of freedom these women have is, to western eyes at least, appalling and incomprehensible. Saudi women of royal birth appear to live in perfumed, pampering prisons.<br /><br />However, if this is a true story then the husband or family of this woman would certainly recognise the stories and identify her with ease which made me wonder how much of it was fantasy or at least greatly exaggerated for the benefit of readers.<br /><br />An interesting read but I felt more that I was reading a novel than a factual account.	2004-08-25

Rather than taking a political or a generalised stance, she looks at the individual and the community surrounding them to define her view of working class culture. She explores several areas such as gender, work, ethnicity, domesticity and locality and covers these areas in essay type chapters. Rather than concentrating on society's view of the working class she looks at how the working class perceives itself. Bourke's main argument is that social force and community is pivotal in an individual's perception of their class.<br /><br />Dr Bourke does put forward a good, if occasionally contradictory argument of how she sees the working class. At times her views seem a little too positive and ignore some of the historical evidence demonstrating the downside of being in this social group. However it is an interesting opinion of working class cultures that she promotes and does help to balance the often all too negative ideas promoted by other historians.<br /><br />This book is easy to read and has useful charts and statistics throughout. Each chapter includes a selective bibliography and at the end of the book there is a comprehensive bibliography as well as extensive notes. Although this book is aimed at undergraduates, its easily read style and inclusion of anecdotes should appeal to anyone with an interest in social history.	2004-08-25

It is quite horrifying to see how these some of these women could be sentenced to seven years 'in land beyond the seas' for what today would be classed as minor misdemeanours.<br />However, the women aboard the Lady Julian were more fortunate than many being aboard a ship with a decent, honest agent and captain to ensure their welfare was taken care of. Many of them became 'wives' to the crew for the duration of the voyage, which of course gave them certain advantages. Nonetheless this book still manages to convey the horror of this punishment and the harsh conditions of the day.<br />Sian Rees manages to inject a little humour at times (such as the antics of some of the women in Tenerife) which provides a welcome relief and stops the book becoming too grim. She also adds some nice touches of history by recounting snippets about Captain Cook and Lieutenant Bligh and the Bounty.<br />This is a good account of crime, punishment and survival in Georgian England and well worth a read.	2004-07-19

In a genre that so often uses the same themes and ideas, Ms Hobb has produced an original work.<br />The Liveships of the title are very expensive and rare ships built from the mysterious wizardwood only found in the Rain River Wilds. After 3 generations of the owner's family have died on board, the wizardwood 'quickens' and the ships become living, sentient beings.<br />Throughout the book, the author interweaves the story of the Liveship traders, the story of the sea serpents who are driven by an instinct to search for their 'beginnings' and the tale of Kennick, a ruthless man determined to be King of the Pirates.<br />Ms Hobbs shows an extraordinary talent for characterisation. There are no totally black or white characters in her stories but realistic characters who have their good sides and their faults in abundance. At times the reader will feel antipathy toward the heroine and at others empathy for the 'bad guy'.<br />This is a book that you will find difficult to put down. Highly recommended	2004-07-19

As with his other books in the Grand Tour series, Saturn could not be called a heavyweight of literature but nonetheless does provide the reader with enough detail and characterisation to keep up interest. The story centres around a space habitat on route to Saturn and populated by a mixed bag of dissidents, 'free thinkers', and general misfits.<br />The main characters are Malcolm Ebberly, a man placed here by one of the major ruling religious groups but with an agenda of his own that wouldn't balk at murder to achieve it and Holly Lane, who is naive and innocent but becomes a hunted fugitive in the labyrinth of passageways beneath the main habitat.<br />Although this book is one of a series, it is not necessary to have read the others to enjoy this one as each tale can stand-alone. An enjoyable story but I'm glad I bought it in paperback and didn't pay for the hardcover version.	2004-07-19

The Empire has been enjoying a Golden Age of peace and prosperity but this is about to end.<br />The hero of the tale is Lewis Deathstalker, descendant of the 'Blessed Owen' who with the usual Deathstalker luck (always bad!) finds himself caught up in the struggle between good and evil. Not only has he managed to make an enemy of his old warrior partner Finn but he has also fallen out with King Douglas (Deathstalker's best friend).To add to his misery there is news of the coming of the 'Terror', an evil that had been prophesised by his illustrious ancestor. Along the way he manages to enlist the assistance of a reptiloid called Saturday, a con man who claims to be descended from the great Jack Random, a psychopathic killing machine called Rose and the Empires most famous opera singer, Jessamine Flowers. This motley crew is all that stands between humanity and total destruction.<br />Old friends and enemies from the first Deathstalker books reappear such as the A.I's of Shub, epers, ELFS etc. Simon R Green once again weaves a story that is eccentric, bloody, fast paced and extremely funny. This is sci-fi at its best and is highly recommended to anyone looking for a rollicking good yarn.	2004-06-20

The tales in this series are quirky to say the least, featuring such oddities as a castle that is really a spaceship, a world full of living toys, a madness maze to mention just a few. However, you would go a long way to find a better series than this.<br />From the first chapter you become caught up with the characters and care about them and what becomes of them. Owen Deathstalker is the hero of the title. His 'mission' is to destroy the empire that is being led by the tyrannical Lionstone (also known as the iron bitch). He is accompanied by Ruby, Hazel and Jack Random, all slightly psychopathic people. This is a fast paced adventure story with numerous characters and scenarios. In spite of the complexity of Deathstalker's universe the author has managed to keep the tale cohesive and easy to read. It is easy to remember who is who and where they belong within this story.<br />Suspend all your preconceptions of what a sci-fi book should be and give this a go...you won't regret it.	2004-06-14

This story however, is a prequel to the other three books, being set in earlier times than the others. Although these books are not a series and can be read in any order, I would recommend reading the others first.<br />Samaria is a world populated by the Mandaavi (merchants), Jansaii (crafty, secretive traders), Edori (peaceful nomads), mortals and lastly, angels (lofty and proud). All believe that the original settlers of their world were carried to Samaria in Jovah's own hands from their war torn homeworld. Jovah (their god) forbids technology as it could lead to the development of weapons and therefore war.<br />The Angels are the intermediaries between man and god. They raise their voices in song to pray for such bounty as medicines, rain, sunshine etc which god then provides. Every twenty years the god appoints a new Archangel, to guide the inhabitants of this land. Jovah also selects a spouse for the new archangel.<br />In this novel the new archangel is Gaaron (Gabriel Aaron). His bride is to be Susannah, an Edori woman who feels trapped in the angels Eyrie having spent all of her life wandering with her people and she is none too happy at being selected as the new Angelica.<br />To add to Gaarons troubles, there are problems in his peaceful world. Reports come in about mysterious men who appear and disappear at will and who are destroying whole camps of travellers. With no weapons they are helpless to fight back. While some are arguing for the creation of weapons others are fearful that Jovah's wrath will destroy them if they do develop them.<br />Sharon Shinn has created a series that is a mixture of romance, fantasy and science fiction. She has managed to produce something different from the usual tales in these genres and for anyone who appreciates something a little different I would highly recommend this.	2004-06-14

He treats his subjects with sympathy whilst not being afraid to point out the less than endearing aspects of their characters.<br />With so many of the Georgian princesses having the same name it is easy to lose track of who is who. Thankfully the author has included a useful family tree at the beginning of the book which helps you to follow the various family lines.<br />The downside of this book is its brevity. The author has covered over 150 years of history in a mere 221 pages which means none of the characters are covered in any great depth.<br />This is a good book with which to gain an overview of these women but if you want an in depth study of them then this may not be the book for you.	2004-01-08

There are some well known ones such as 'Charge of the light brigade' and 'Daffodils' but if you are looking for a book that will help you brush up on all of those half remembered snippets of poetry from your schooldays, then this may not be the choice for you.

Having been exiled from the clan that raised her, Ayla now has to set out on a journey to find the 'others', cro-magnons like herself.<br />This is the epic tale of a young girl's struggle to survive by overcoming fear and adapting to being alone in a strange and hostile environment.<br />During her travels Ayla discovers the valley that becomes her home and her haven and it is here that she find much longed for companionship with the horse she raises from being a foal.<br />Running parallel to this is the story of two cro-magnon brothers who have set off on a journey in search of adventure. Ms Auel manages to handle these two story strands with ease and switching between them never 'jars'. Eventually the two tales intertwine and become one as Ayla finally comes face to face with one of her own kind. As rich in detail as the first book in the series, this book is an absorbing read and is difficult to put down. Highly recommended.	2004-01-03

Jean M Auel has obviously done her research before embarking on this novel and by doing so has managed to recreate the ancient world of the Neanderthals in a totally believable way.<br />This is such an evocative book you can visualise the clan and their surroundings almost as if you were sat among them. The sights, sounds, smells are described so well that they feel almost real. It makes for a fascinating glimpse in to an ancient, forgotten way of life.<br />Interwoven with this, is the wonderful tale of Ayla, a young Cro-Magnon girl who is adopted by a clan of Neanderthals after an earthquake leaves her orphaned. Her 'adoptive' mother, Isa, along with the clan's Magician, Creb, try hard to integrate Ayla into their community but not everyone is as welcoming to this strange child who not only looks so different, but acts in a way that is so alien to them.<br />A young clan male, Broud, hates Ayla with a passion and unfortunately for Ayla, Broud is destined to be clan leader one day. Her struggle to be accepted among the members of the clan and the interaction between all of the characters, along with the richly detailed descriptions, make for a fascinating and absorbing read. This book works well on all levels and I would highly recommend it.	2004-01-03

It should prove as big a hit with Harry Potter fans as the previous books in the series 'though how well it will appeal to the younger reader I am not sure as this book is a lot 'darker' than it's predecessors. Harry is now 15 years old and has become a moody, angry teenager, very different from how he has been portrayed previously. At times it is difficult to like him and sometimes his behaviour is downright annoying. However Rowling has sympathetically portrayed the 'angst' of teenagers and the difficulties of growing up whilst still managing to weave a captivating story and maintaining the magic that is Harry Potter.<br />Favourite characters are still around as well as some new ones including the truly horrendous new defence against the dark arts teacher, Dolores Jane Umbridge who proves not only unpopular with the pupils but also upsets the majority of the staff.<br />Harry learns more about his past in this book and also discovers why he must spend his holidays with the Dursleys even though they obviously don't want him around. He also grapples with the difficulties of his first romantic relationship. The reason for Professor Snape's antipathy toward Harry is uncovered as more of Snape's past is disclosed.<br />This is as enjoyable as all of the other Potter books....well worth adding to your collection.	2003-09-16
