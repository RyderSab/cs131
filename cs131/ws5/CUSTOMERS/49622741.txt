Unfortunately, in some parts it wasn't much more than that. The thing with Lori Wick's characters is that more often than not they are . . . well, too perfect. I have met plenty of people who are as good as the characters in many Christian novels, but I have never met anybody who did not struggle with being good all the time. Still, Mandy and her siblings were quite realistic, and it was my attachment to Mandy that gave this book four stars instead of three. The big disappointment was that what should have been the climax was only remembered by Mandy, not experienced. All the tension had just . . . disappeared. I felt something not unlike jet-lag.	2001-03-18

If I had not had this assignment, I would not have read it. Firstly, I will make it clear that I am sixteen years old, not sixty. I know a lot about New Age teachings. I do not consider myself to be narrow-minded person. I know I'm not. But it makes me sick to think that someone could marry together the holy and upright teachings of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the New Age. Perhaps the author is not familiar with Deuteronomy 18:10-11 that warns us not to pracitice divination, interpret omens or consult the dead. Did not God, in Leviticus 20:6 say he would turn his face against those people? Hasn't the author ever read in the book of Revelation about the woman Jezebel who taught the so-called secrets of God? Didn't God warn His children against following her teachings. Or then again, maybe the author does not read his Bible anymore. If he does, then he must never take such obvious warnings literally. I warn all readers, stay clear of this book. It is so filled with a quest for Beauty that it has forgotten about Jesus, the way, the truth, and the light.	2001-03-18

It convicted me, inspired me, and moved me. I read a lot of books, and I mean a lot, but very few are in the calibre this book is in. The characters are very real and the way in which they relate to one another makes you feel as though you are a part of the action. I became so involved that at the end of the book I felt as though I had lost many friends. The writing style itself flows smoothly, never feeling stilted or cheap. The story-line was exciting, and the historical detail is so wound up in the story it becomes difficult to separate the two. All in all, I'd recommend this book to anyone, and I am sure that I will read it again and again and again.	2001-02-28

Stackpole. The action sequences are fabulous - you feel as though you are a part of it, not a mere bystander. The characters were all well-realised, and I was particularly happy with Mara, as Stackpole, apart from Timothy Zahn, of course, has a far better grip on her than the other SW writers seem to have. We get to learn a lot more about the Vong culture and way of thinking then what we previously knew, and I found that it helped with my understanding of the plot a lot more. The ending upset me on a personal note, but on an impersonal note, I'd have to say that it was quite exceptional. Very unexpected, and unexcepted is good. I wished, however, that the sub-plot about Daeshara'cor, though good by itself, had a bit more to do with the overall scheme of things.	2000-12-18

I find I lose focus too quickly. This collection was a delightful surprise, however. Each story stood on its own and all had a message - something that not all Lori Wick books contain. In fact, I found that most of the stories have a greater impact and message, as well as more realism than many of Ms. Wick's novels. One tiny point annoyed me, however. I seem to remember that in &quot;A Rancher's Lady&quot;, Shasta, an Australian, mentions that she used to work on a sheep ranch. I am an Australian and I can assure any disillusioned Americans out there that we do not have &quot;ranches&quot; in Australia. We call them &quot;stations&quot; instead. A silly thing for me to bother about, I know, but I must be truthful. All in all, a lovely addition to the library of any fan of Lori Wick.	2000-12-16

I can say now that reading it was a most pleasurable experience. Jude Watson has done an admirable job with this journal. It is the deep introspections of a young girl, told shrewdly with a great deal of empathy, not only for Amidala, but for all the characters that she interacts with. The journal displays Amidala's keen insight, and sharp mind, and examines her motives and decisions with great sensitivity. It tells us a little about her background, and her relationships with the people around her. At the end, I felt as though I had discovered a real person.	2000-12-14

He's not flawless, of course, but he certainly displays greater skill in this difficult genre than anyone else. The fact that he is the author is a good  recommendation for the Hand of Thrawn dualogy. Once again we have the high  quality writing, the well-handled plot lines, and good characterisations.  It's great to see Mara once again under the pen of her creator. No one else  - except maybe Stackpole - can get her quite right. Even better was the  handling of Luke's bad habit of using the Force too much, though this has  been seen as a virtue by some writers eg Mr Anderson. All in all, a great  book.	2000-07-22

Firstly, this superweapon fascination is just about wearing out. Secondly, Anderson is only a mediocre writer. Thirdly, Anderson always represents  Luke as an omnipotent, all-powerful Jedi. A little of the humble humaness  that Luke displays in the movies is needed here. Lastly, the Kyp Durron  situation could have been resolved in - dare I say it? - a more realistic  fashion. However, the characterisations - with the exception of Luke, Han  and Mara - are good, and the plot moves along at a good pace. For die-hard  Star Wars fans only.	2000-07-20

The characters develop nicely, and of course, we get to meet Ehlana. The book is characterised by the same dry sense of humour that comes out in all of  Eddings books. However, often untrue and sometimes offensive remarks about  the Christian church and its beliefs spoiled the enjoyment for me at times.

Finally, the safety of the characters is no longer assured, adding to the tension. The Solo children have their own personalites. The galaxy is no longer some big,  happy playground where no one of importance gets hurt. It starts of in a  new direction, and breathes a little life into that far away galaxy. It has  a good plot. The characterisations - with the exception of Han and Mara  (few people get them right) - are good.<br />Now for what I didn't like. The  writing style is very ordinary. Too ordinary. This may be a Star Wars book,  but that is no reason why a few literary niceties can't be included.  Second, are Luke and Mara really in love? Because they sure aren't acting  like it? And why, may I ask, have they no children yet? I thought that the  fans of Star Wars would be thrilled to see Luke as a father. They're both  getting to old. Something needs to be done about this.	2000-07-17

Sigh. It is the circumstances,  as well as the secondary plot lines that give this book incredible power.  It is a mirrored reflection of modern times. A demoralised society  whitewashed to the outside world, but inside it is decadent, amoral and  corrupt. It is against this background that a young tribune, Marcus  Vinicius meets Lygia, the adopted daughter of a Roman general and decides  that he wants her as his mistress. Lygia, however, is a Christian.  The  characters in this novel are many, some fictional, others factual, and all  have an immense impact on the development and effect of the story. Firstly,  there is Marcus Vinicius, who believes that he must get the best out of  life. He does not understand the Christians who allow the wishes of their  God to prevent them from participating in the pleasures he has indulged  himself in all his life. Then there is Lygia, a dedicated Christian who  desperately tries to explain her faith and the joy and new life it brings  to a disbelieving Marcus, and is confused when he does not seem to feel  what she feels and see what she sees. Petronius is probably the best  realised modern character of all. He is a satirical, well-educated man who  is quite ready to believe that Christ existed and that He is powerful above  all, but has no intention of following Jesus because it will mean  disrupting his way of life. Chilo is another. He is one who thinks that he  understands Christianity but really does not because he was failed to  percieve the beliefs, the concepts, and the soul of the faith, and thus has  missed the whole point of the Christian religion. This is a very well  written. Unfortunately, some parts of the translation fall completely flat,  while other fairly ring with power. A very satisfying read.	2000-07-10

Die-hard Star Wars fans will probably read it anyway, despite what myself and other reviewers are saying. Firstly, I spent nearly two-thirds of the  book trying to figure out whether it had a plot or not. As it turns out, it  doesn't. The original Star Wars characters are fairly well done, but the  other characters fall completely flat. And Callista . . . well she's nice  and all that, but she doesn't seem quite the right chick for Luke. Mara is  much better. (Sorry to all the people who have been living in caves and  haven't found that out yet.) I personally find Ms. Hambly's writing syle  very difficult to get involved in. I felt it distanced me from what was  going on in the book. And, lastly, this book had none of the magic which is  Star Wars. A great disappointment.	2000-06-05

I do not believe in changing horses while crossong a stream. However, Allston seems to slipped into Stackpole's shoes without a problem.  His characterisation of Wedge is spot on, making him one of the two writers  who have managed to get into his head with complete success. (The other  being Stackpole.) This book deals with a whole new set of characters, all  who have been exceptionally well realised. Plus there is humour. The humour  is perhaps one of the best features of the book, and at the same time does  not take away from the more serious undertones of the story. I know some  will be disappointed with a change from the Rogues to the Wraiths, but as a  matter of preference I like the Wraiths best anyway. A great book.	2000-05-13

I think one of the best things about Stackpole's writing is the empathy he creates for and with the characters. The characters feel real emotion, and  are not stereotyped. (Stereotyping, by the way, tends to be a problem with  some Star Wars novels.) The book is exiciting and well-paced, though,  unfortunately, I am not very keen on the whole space battle thing. I am  more interested in other aspects of Star Wars. I must also say that the  inclusion of Booster Terrik added some good humour to the situation, which  I thought was good. In addition, we also have an appearance by Talon  Karrde. Overall, a great read. Recommended to any fan of the X-Wing series.	2000-05-09

Gaeriel is pretty cool, but I'm glad she and Luke don't end up together. Now, what did I like about this book? The author  develops all the characters nicely, and more importantly, realistically.  The plot moves along nicely. One problem I did have was the not very well  put Leia/Vader issue. That, I think, could have been better resolved. Plus,  Luke seems a little too much like his former self (ANH and TESB) than he  does his new self (ROTJ). Still, over all, a great read.	2000-05-07

I am also fond of a good romance. As a romance, this book was good, but as a piece of Christian literature, it fails to hit the vital spot. I don't know how other readers feel, but I believe that a Christian novel needs to more than good, pure,  upstanding, non-offensive literature, but also deeply challenging, focusing  on the issues that effect so many lives. The book itself is good. It is  well written, but I found Stacy to be almost boringly similar to many of  Lori's other female characters. Ditto for the husband and wife  relationship. I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy this book. I did, very  much. I'm sure a lot of people will think I'm too critical, but I can't  change my opinion, I'm afraid. However, if you enjoy Lori Wick, I'm sure  you'll enjoy this one too.	2000-04-30

It is funny, enchanting, and above all highly entertaining. Unlike so many other books written in it's era, The Five Children and It does not  attempt to preach or teach. Instead, it tells things as they are. The  children themselves are alive and refreshing instead of painfully good.  This book is not only for the young but the young at heart.	2000-04-28

I read it for the first time when I was eight, and seven years later I still enjoy it. Pollyanna herself is truly heartwarming, even though at times she seems a  little too good to be true. The other characters are also a little  stereotyped, but they have been so well described and woven into the story  that it doesn't matter so much. A must read.	2000-04-28

I am a firm believer in that the clash of personalities makes a bigger noise than the clash of sabres. However, this book moved through the story nicely, and if  some of the characters tend to get a little unrealistic at times I guess I  can put up with that.	2000-04-27

The characters are real and vivid. The plot is good. Written with a distinct feminist slant, the book is characterised with sly humour that make such a long book much easier to read. The relationships in this book  are truly heart-warming. Fascinating. For anyone who loves a good fantasy  story, this is a must.	2000-04-27

Secondly, Luke is not represented as an omnipotent Jedi like he is in the Jedi Academy Trilogy. Instead he is a  human being just like everyone else. Thirdly, Stackpole has done an  impressive job with Mara Jade (whom I love). Fourthly and Fiftly, this book  has great insights about the Jedi and about the events that are recorded in  other books. Sixthly, Corran, whom I was not really keen on in the X-wing  books is actually an enjoyable character in this book.  Overall, a simply  excellant must-read book for any Star Wars fan.	2000-04-27

I enjoed this book mainly because of the exciting plot.  I like books that don't stop until the end. Having read it for a second  time (as well as all the other books) I understand it better. I felt it  carried on well after Thrawn Trilogy, as well as letting fans catch up on  Wedge and co.	2000-04-27

The story was told with a great sense of humour - something I appreciate in any book. And, yes, someone does die. (I cried but I cry in everything.)The  book was an easy read, which means, in my terminology, that it was easy to  understand and get involved in without being a mediocre washout or so  involved in on itself that no one can understand. A great book.	2000-04-27

It serves as a perfect prequel novel to ANH. In this book we see how Han won the Millenium Falcon, and why he and Lando stopped asscotiating. A.C. Crispin has done a commendable job of rounding out Han's character into the Han we met in the  movies. A great read.	2000-04-27

Crispin is a great writer. I felt that Han was really well represented, along with his relationship with Chewbacca. The author has done a marvellous job  incorporating every single smuggling buddy Han has ever been recorded to  have. The bit with the fortune-teller was a nice touch.	2000-04-27
US	49622741	R2UIDSUCOO6O7M	0553574132	967938127	Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Bre's	This book does a good job setting the scene for ROTJ. It moves at a good pace, with a satisfying ending. Darth Vader has been well characterised. However, in light of the release of The Phantom Menace, Darth Vader's  preconception of his own force skills in comparison to his son's are a  little awry. Also, I do not believe that Leia could be taken in so easily  by Xixor(whom incidently started my sistor off with naming every character  in the book after a piece of platground equipment). Over all, a good read.	2000-04-27

This super-weapon threat thing is starting to get on my nerves. Despite this, the plot and the characterisations are good, even thouhgh this child genius thing is getting a little hard to take. Why oh why can't the Solo kids just  be normal? The writing is mediocre, nothing more.  A book for die-hard Star  Wars fans only.	2000-04-27
US	49622741	R1TGFW7U5BP96L	0140380736	441425714	The Arkadians	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Bre's	Charming, magical, exciting . . . just a few words to describe Lloyd Alexander's The Arkadians. Influenced heavily by Greek mythology, this book bears distinct similarities to Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain. Readers will note the similarity between Eilonwy and Joy-in-the-Dance. Altogether  enjoyable. A must read.	2000-04-27
