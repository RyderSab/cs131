But it is unsurpassed as a panoramic view of high-brow Christianity in the the twentieth century and its many discontents.  It provided me of a good understanding of contemporary religious thought and of the emotional forces that drive it.  It is surprising how much ground Gardner covers in this slim volume, providing lucid and vivid descriptions of the work of the religious existentialists, of Barth, Tillich, Chesterton and the neo-Thomists, the Unitarian humanists and of the underpinning emotional forces that drive these various attempts to conserve religion in the face of a scientific worldview that denies its fundamental factual claims and a high-brow worldview that rejects many of its moral teachings.	2000-10-14

This book succeeds wonderfully at ridiculing not only the more dubious aspects of the Russian ideosyncracy (such as their fondness  for liquor, autocracy, mental illness, and attempted suicide) but also the  pretensions of contemporary American literary academics.<br />The chapters on  the origins of Russian literature, on Dostoevsky, and on Tolstoy are among  the funniest things I have ever read.  Others chapters are less consistent,  but the literate misanthropy and the impatience with irrationality that  informs them makes the entire book both enjoyable and relevant.<br />I  recommend this very highly.	2000-07-07

His agenda was always perfectly clear: to find a certainty that would bring sanity and proportion.  Although his cheerful, reasonable, and very English  religiosity couldn't be more different from the tortured, violent, and very  Russian faith of Dostoevsky, they both had the same origin:  the dread that  if there is no God all is permitted and that then suicide is the only  desirable alternative.<br />As described here, St. Thomas Aquinas is the very  embodiment of that Chestertonian ideal, a large bull of man with a quick  intelligence (like Chesterton himself), whose certainty about the  fundamentals (the existence of God, the desirableness of life, the validity  of moral law, the authority of the Catholic Church) gave him a peace of  mind, a sturdiness of purpose, and an almost child-like simplicity.<br />I  don't share Chesterton's metaphysics (I'm an atheist myself), but he is  often more correct in his appreciations than many secular writers.  For  instance, reviewers in this page have criticized him for dismissing Islam  and Buddhism, but what he says about them is perfectly accurate:  Islam is  theologically unsophisticated (the Koran emphasizes that the reward for  abiding by its rules is a paradise peopled by &quot;bashful virgins&quot;  and other perfectly earthly delights) and Buddhism is nihilistic (one  should seek to extinguish all desire, and Nirvana can be reached only when  one has ceased to want even that).  Whether those are faults or virtues is  up to the reader's own philosophy.<br />I recommend this book as an eloquent  exposition of the antithesis to existentialist angst, and as such it should  be of interest to the religious and the secular alike.	2000-05-07

It is a very serious and overwhelmingly sad book about a good man who fathered a monstrous criminal and about his  efforts to understand how that came to happen.  It is one of the most  disturbing and important books I have read about the experience of  fatherhood, and the moral and psychological issues that it raises are  difficult and vastly important.  It is an unsensational and unsentimental  but tragically moving book written with modesty and intelligence, and it  does not deserve the kind of readership that it got.	2000-04-21

Everything that Orwell wrote is worth reading, and this book  might well be his best.<br />Orwell is a master of expository prose.  His  writing is very richly descriptive and yet stark, simple, and lucid.  For  instance, he writes of his first exposure to battle in Spain: &quot;We were  near the front line now, near enough to smell the characteristic smell of  war - in my experience a smell of excrement and decaying  food.&quot;<br />Orwell was the best kind of socialist: a generous man  genuinely concerned about equality and about ending the exploitation of the  poor.  And unlike most other left-wing intellectuals of his time, he was  not content to write pamphlets from the confort of peace and affluence, nor  did he ever allow his politics to blind him to the reality of how the  ideals of socialism were betrayed by the ambition and pettiness of many of  those who put it into practice.	2000-04-16

In particular, he thinks that because scientists often dismiss anomalous results that appear to contradict their theories they are not fully  reasonable and rather operate on metaphysical assumptions.<br />But ever since  the beginning of science every single successful theory has coexisted with  anomalous results.  Sometimes these eventually lead to a theory having to  be rejected.  Much more often these anomalous results turn out to be  experimental errors or misinterpretations, and end up going away.  The fact  is that any professional scientist has to make reasoned choices based not  on certainty, but on preponderance of evidence and logical coherence.   Otherwise they would never be able to hold any beliefs at all.  For  instance, when a respected group of physicists announced that they had seen  isolated quarks, very few people believed them, because the accepted theory  was strongly against it.  Their results turned out to be irreproducible,  and the theory remains safe.  Prof. Johnson would have had physicists burn  their textbooks at the first sign of trouble.<br />Besides, Prof. Johnson's  alternative to naturalism is traditional Christianity, which has a myriad  more inconsistencies with itself and with the world as we observe it than  the most discredited scientific theory ever held.	2000-03-04

Naturally, I have developed a fascination for this brand of brutal pessimistic humor. This is certainly not the best  in the line, but its sheer unsophistication can be refreshing.<br />As a  whole, this book is uneven, but at its best it's outrageously funny (for  instance, when it advices that you can get rid of your children by telling  them a that &quot;street hustling is a tried-and-true stepping-stone to  movie stardom.&quot;)<br />Some might be disturbed by a book that says things  like &quot;think of the sweet release of death,&quot; even in jest.  But I  have discovered that for misanthropes like myself irony and a sense of  humor are priceless survival skills.  You will find that the dangerous  misanthropes (like the Columbine killers) are the ones with large egos and  no sense of humor.<br />If you enjoy this sort of thing but would like it in a  more sophisticated form, I recommend Ambrose Bierce's _The Devil's  Dictionary_ (first published in 1906), which memorably defined life as  &quot;a spiritual pickle that keeps the body from decay.&quot;	2000-02-15

The formula is always the same:  take a simple idea based on sentiment rather than logic, and then take several hundred  pages to present it as obscurely as possible, with as many compound words,  hyphenated terms, and dependent clauses as the page can take, until the  result is completely unreadable.  Then those who are ashamed to admit that  they understood nothing will praise the work to the skies, and academics  will make a good living by lecturing on the subject to students similarly  unwilling to admit their confusion.<br />As far as I can tell, there is  nothing more to this book than the very old anxiety we have all felt over  unanswerable (and logically meaningless questions) like, 'Why I am who I am  rather than someone else or no one at all?',  'Why is now the moment it is  rather than any other moment in time?' and so on.  The book, of course,  offers no answers (there are none), just plenty of  obfuscation.<br />Furthermore, Heidegger was a very questionable character, a  man who enthusiastically embraced Nazism and persecuted Jewish scholars  during his tenure as rector of Heidelberg, who later dishonestly denied his  philosophy's ties with Nazism when his reputation and career were at stake,  a thinker who detested science and reason and whose solipsistic philosophy  was never  concerned with ethics.<br />Don't waste your time with this.

As such, this book deserves consideration.  But it is not what it claims to be.<br />Mr. Cornwell would  have us belief he was originally sympathetic to Pius XII but that access to  previously secret information about the Pope caused him to change his mind.   That is, the book claims to be based on new revelation.  It's not.  It's  an analysis of widely known historical information by one critical of the  Catholic conservativism that Pius XII advanced.<br />Mr. Cornwell is first and  foremost concerned with criticizing the conservative faction that advocates  centralized church authority, enforced doctrinal orthodoxy, and the  precedence of personal holiness over social action.  His analysis of Pius's  papacy is a vehicle for this critique.  He dedicates considerable attention  to the First Vatican Council, to the papacy of the arch-conservative Pius  X, and to the current backslash against the progressive legacy of the  Second Vatican Council, all topics that bear no relation to Pius XII's role  in the Second World War, the book's ostensive subject matter.<br />Mr.  Cornwell admits that he gained access to archives in possession of the  Jesuits by claiming he was favorable to Pius, but pretends that this was  true at the time.  This seems to me very implausible, since all of Mr.  Conrwell's previous books about the Catholic Church have expressed the same  anti-conservative, anti-hierarchic orientation that is so evident  throughout this work.  Moreover, Mr. Cornwell dislikes Pius XII personally.   He is not above repeating gossip about his housekeeper or informing us  that his corpse was grotesquely putrified at the time of his  funeral.<br />That said, I think the book is worth reading and commenting.  I  am personally inclined to agree with Mr. Conrwell that Pius XII did more  harm than good to the Catholic Church.  But readers should keep in mind  that this work was not written in good faith.	1999-10-18

There is something about the German language (perhaps it's the abundance of compound words, or the complicated grammar) that promotes this kind of philosophy - by - obfuscation.  The phenomenon is widespread, (cf. Hegel,  Heidegger, Adorno, et al).  Take a relatively simple idea, preferrably one  based on sentiment rather than logic, and then try to convey it as  obscurely as possible through the use of compound words, vast sentences  brimming with dependent clauses, and the most paradoxical lines of  reasoning available.  The result will then be hailed as a masterpiece by  those who make a living out of teaching courses on this material (and those  who take the courses and are afraid to admit they didn't understand  much).<br />Out of the idea that the relations of the self to others are very  important (and that God is the most important of those others), Buber has  crafted this impenatrable monstrosity.  Sadly, there are many others like  him out there, whose livelihood comes from being as verbose as humanly  possible.

By and large what he says is true, but what it amounts to is not  so much an indictment of Mother Theresa as an attack on the religion she  represented, one that holds, for instance, that salvation is more important  than health or confort, that suffering may be a way to greater holiness,  and that abortion is a grievous sin.  I understand how someone like Mr.  Hitchens might disagree with these views (indeed, I am an atheist and  disagree with them too), but the book amounts to the shocking revelation  that Mother Theresa was (gasp!) a traditional Catholic.	1999-07-30

This book is a particularly vivid example of this contradiction.  I found parts of the  novel almost painfully bad (one of the characters trying to communicate  from the afterlife through an incompetent medium, or the epilogue that in  effect abandons any pretense of being part of novel in order to become an  unconfortable mix of essay and sermon).  There is also the lingering  problem of Huxley's uninformed and unfair attitude towards natural science.   But in exchange for accepting these failures the reader gets two  extraordinary character portraits: one of a monster (Mrs. Thwale) and one  of a saint (Bruno the bookseller), both very convincing and immensely  insightful.  Add to that a penetrating study of the perils of  self-absorption, a sound case for moral restraint, and the best diagnosis I  have come across of why artists who express the most sublime insight about  human nature can still behave like swine.  It's sad and doubly ironic the  Huxley himself should have been an impeachable character.  Anyway, quite a  worthwhile read.	1999-07-14

It was the most  redolent, self-absorbed, insipid postmodern claptrap conceivable, the work  of a disturbed, soulless man whose vanity is much too vast to leave room  for anything like art or poetry.

But the movie is forced to make it all explicit,  revealing that the Reason vs. Emotion debate is in fact rather hackneyed,  and that the &quot;voluptuousness of doom&quot; Mann speaks of is just an  older man's obsession with a pretty little boy.  My hat goes off to Mann as  a stylist, but I am ashamed I was taken in by this.	1999-05-25

I was also strongly  captivated by the author's Narnia series of children's books, and I was  ready to count myself a Lewis fan.  But Lewis's non-fiction, although  written with flair and clarity, proved disappointing.  His penchant for  allegory and metaphor makes his fiction great, but it undermines the logic  of books like Mere Christianity and Miracles.  And although Surprised by  Joy is, like all of his books, very enjoyably written, it destroyed my  former conception of Lewis by revealing how dependent his religious beliefs  were on his own personality and emotional struggles.  We must commend Lewis  for not tidying up his image, but the effect of the book, for me, was to  cast a veil of doubt over everything else he published.	1999-05-15

In the face of fashionable twentieth-century irrationalism and associated  political fanaticisms, Popper stresses the importance of intellectual  modesty, rational discourse, non-violence, tolerance, and an open society.   In this series of collected essays Popper makes a lucid and compelling case  for a philosophy that accepts that all of our knowledge is conjectural and  uncertain, but that this, far from leading to irrationality, makes science  and reason the best tools we have for confronting the universe that  surrounds us.  In contrast with the impenetrable, self-important nonsense  of many modern philosophers, Popper writes with a refreshing simplificity  and modesty.

I ended enjoying the book a great deal.  It is difficult to write memoirs that steer away from off-putting pretension while being interesting  and humorous, but Watkins has done just that.  He succeeds largely by  making the book more about his perception of his surroundings than about  himself.  But I am afraid the book is bound to have a somewhat limited  appeal.  At the very end Watkins tries to give the nostalgia for his  schooldays  existential meaning, but he is forced to admit he does not  quite know how to go about that.

Lewis is a magnificent writer, and he has a fondness for metaphor that serves his style very well and that makes his fiction delightful.  And certainly this book, like all of his work, is inspired by an unusually  clear understanding of the human mind and of human desire.  But as a  philosopher and an apologist, Lewis leaves much to be desired, especially  if you do not happen to be a devout Christian to begin with.  He  over-simplifies, side-steps important objections, and insists in arguing by  allegory (something that any logician will tell you is a major no-no  because the appropriateness of the allegory is itself open to contention).   But it is still worth reading.  I found his treatment of the problem of  pride especially inspired.	1998-12-06

One of the most unusual poems ever written, &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; is the uncontested masterpiece of nonsense verse.  The verbal richness and flexibility of the English language are exploited to the  utmost in this riotously funny, formally perfect, and delightfully absurd  narrative poem about a strange assortment of characters out to hunt a  fearsome creature known, among other things, for its habit of getting up so  late that it breakfasts af five-o'clock tea and dines on the following day.  No review can do justice to a work as original and extraordinary as this  one, written more than a century ago to entertain Victorian children, but  read now mostly by grownups.  This is the very pinnacle of British humor,  soaring far above even Monty Python's most inspired moments.	1998-12-04

Safranski's biography is a valuable resource, providing  an accessible and actually rather detailed account of the evolution of  Heidegger's ideas.  He also does an excellent job at elucidating the tricky  topic of the relationship between his philosophy and his Nazi sympathies  before and during World War II.  He treats the philosopher fairly and with  a detachedness that fits the subject very well.	1998-12-01

The message is simple but extraordinarily powerful:  life is short, the past and the future are inaccessible, pain and pleasure have no meaning, but inside each one of us  there is a ruling faculty that is touched only by itself.  Only that which  makes us better capable of confronting our condition with resolution and  courage can be said to be good, and only that which makes us worse and more  unsatisfied can be said to be bad.  The only thing that is of any  importance is our own private quest for perfection, which no external power  can ever destroy.   Marcus Aurelius delivers many insightful and  inspirational observations about human nature and the human condition, and  he makes an excellent rational argument for seeking the good and for acting  modestly and continently.  I cannot think or a more satifying and moving  work, and it is all the more poignant because it was written by a man who  wielded almost absolute power and lived surrounded by the luxury, yet  managed to keep things in perspective and to occupy himself only with what  truly matters.  One sentence captures perfectly the spirit of his writings:   &quot;Where a man can live, there he can also live well.&quot;  An  extraordinary testimony of wisdom and fortitude.	1998-12-01

(Adventures of a Curious Character)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of the most comical autobiographies ever	This book is extraordinarily funny, and not in a subtle or literary way.  Quite simply it will have you rolling on the floor as the Nobel-laureate tells of his stint playing the frigideira (a sort of inverted metal pot) in  a Brazilian school of Samba, of the time he was declared mentally unfit to  serve in the army because he insisted he could sometimes hear voices in his  head, or the time he serendipitoulsy pointed out a fatal flaw in the design  of an uranium enriching facility even though he couldn't tell whether the  symbols in the blueprints were valves or windows.  Whether the stories he  tells are all true or not, you have to admire Prof. Feynman's sheer  inventiveness and his unmatched talent as a narrator and a humorist.  A  word of caution, however:  a faithful movie adaptation of these memoirs  would not be rated PG.	1998-11-24

They do add up to a narrative, but that is in a sense secondary.  The result is a  sprawling work that seems to be trying to cover too much ground and to say  too many different things, but that is redeemed by the sheer inventiveness  of the various images that make it up.  Some of them are unforgettable (for  instance, the prophet's scribe losing his faith, or the pilgrims who are  miraculously followed by a cloud of butterflies, yet who wait in vain for  the sea to open before them).  One recurrent theme haunted me most of all:   the sense of dread of the skeptic before the  fearsome possibility of a  miracle.  The novel also makes many interesting points about cultural  assimilation, family relationships, celebrity, and the place of traditional  religion in the modern technological world, to mention a few.<br />I recommend  it, and the book is not nearly as difficult as the first pages suggest.   There are various treads, many of which combine realism with fantasy, but  they are perfectly intelligible, and the plot they add up to is a little  bizarre but entirely well-defined.  There are many jokes at the expense of  Islam, so some devout Muslims might be put off, but I am sure no one needs  me to point that out...	1998-11-22

In it historical fiction and magical realism come together to produce a masterful work of art and an  unforgettable story about the triumph of human dignity in the midst of  destruction and senseless horror.  Using as a setting one of the most  bizarre episodes in history (the Haitian independence and its aftermath),  Carpentier tells a mesmerizing story that reveals human beings in all their  complexity, contradictions and pervesity, but also in their extraordinary  power of survival and redemption.  A literary masterpiece of the highest  order.	1998-11-18

After reading it I still claim that Karamazov is better, but this novel is  certainly not to be missed.  It is touter than some of Dostoevsky's other  works, and it contains some of his best characterizations, all suffused  with a very dark and very penetrating  sense of humor.  No one will forget  the nihilist Kirilov, who wishes to kill himself in order to become God,  the naive aesthete Stepan Trofimovitch and his final, farcical escape into  peasant Russia, or Nikolai Stavrogin, haunted by a terrible crime that is  made all the worse because it is too ordinary.  The whole novel is an  unabashed piece of anti-revolutionary (indeed, reactionary) propaganda, but  even the characters that are intended as caricatures come across as  fascinating and oddly believable.  This novel displays as well as any other  of his works the author's extraordinary understanding of the tortured ways  of the human spirit.	1998-11-18

The style is simple, but the narrative is lush, subtle and deeply hauting.  The end-result is one of the most quietly  disturbing pieces I have read.  Mann himself described it as a tale  concerned with &quot;corruption, and the voluptuousness of doom.&quot;  The  protagonist, Aschenbach, a famous writer whose work champions reflected  self-control, is ultimately destroyed by an overwhelming fascination with a  child of unusual physical beauty.  His obsession is apparently innocent,  but its takes over his mind and becomes his doom.  A testimony to the  strange and destructive powers that live in us.	1998-11-17

The author's painful, overriding preoccupation with his own emotions (which in novels like Narcissus and Goldmund and Siddartha is transformed  into high art) here becomes blatant, self-indulgent, adolescent, and  ultimately rather irritating.  The novel starts out promisingly and  provides some very powerful images, but after a few chapters it begins to  degenerate into outright silliness.  The ending is especially unconvicing,  suggesting that Hesse had trouble leading his story to a conclusion.  Those  with highly introspective temperaments like Hesse's might enjoy the novel,  and those with a special interest in the author would do well to study it,  but the same themes it develops are treated much much more satisfyingly in  other of his novels.	1998-11-17

It is very well written, combining both hard scientific fact with mystery and high adventure.  It reads like a novel and provides an excellent background on Haitian culture and the  anthropology of voodoo.  I object to Davis's relativistic stance that  magical and scientific thought are in some sense equally valid and that we  are culturally conditioned to accept one or the other.  But the science is  there (after all, it was Davis who cracked the medical mystery of  zombification), and his respect for the the theology of voodoo helps make  his account personal and lively.  I recommend it highly.	1998-11-16

But in order to appreciate it fully, the modern, non-Victorian reader  requires some guidance, as well as an adequate background on the man and  the times that produced Alice.  Martin Gardner, the greatest figure ever in  recreational mathematics, provides readers with all the information they  need to appreciate this story at its various levels.  This book occupies a  place of privilege in the library of every serious Alice fan.	1998-11-16

Sagan writes beautifully, and he makes a very powerful case that  the modern combination of awesome scientific power with widespread  scientific ignorance is bound to lead us to trouble.  As good a case as has  ever been made for better scientific education for lay people.	1998-11-13

It does not require any prior mathematical  knowledge beyond the basics, although it probably will be of interest only  to those that care about math at its most abstract.  It is fascinating to  realize how much we take for granted when we do math and how much ingenuity  it takes to pin down the concept of number.  Highly recommended.	1998-09-30
