On one hand I found it to be good, but on the other hand I found the characters to be punks (i.e Dylan).  I am around the age of these character and some of the things that they were doing was unheard of.  And lets not forget some of words that was used.  I'm sorry but most men and women in their twenties don't use the word &quot;johnson&quot;.
