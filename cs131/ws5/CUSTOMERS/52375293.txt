Harriet Klausner gives a good summary of the plot so I won't repeat. Longtime fans will see that the book has a hint of past plots. However, Autumn's personality does justice to her female ancestors.  Bertrice Small does a good job of weaving historical events into the events of Autumn's life.  <br />I still find that Bertrice Small is one of the best writers in the subgenre of historical romance.  Her plots have substance in the sense that many historical figures make appearances into the story and by virtue of the main characters' stations in life, the appearances are somewhat feasible.  Bertrice Small had a few books in the past few years that were missing her magic, but with &quot;Besieged&quot; and &quot;Intrigued&quot; she has returned.  <br />Back to &quot;Intrigued&quot; .... What I enjoyed most about this book was watching the growth that Autumn experiences.  She moves from sheltered teenager to a wise woman, learning from and accepting her mistakes along the way, making her seem much more human.  <br />I would recommend this book both to long time fans and readers who have never read her before now.  This book will whet the appetite for future books in the series as well as a revisitation of past books.	2001-02-11

Beseiged is not like any of her recent books (Bedazzled, Betrayed, Deceived, Darling Jasmine, The Innocent) because the characters are more developed. Small still lacks the strength  of her early books (The Kadin, Adora, Skye O'Malley) I cannot repeat this  enough.<br />Fortune displays personality traits more reminiscent of Skye.  Jasmine acted more like the Jasmine of Wild Jasmine. However, I found the  character of James Leslie lacking the depth of the James Leslie in Wild  Jasmine. I enjoyed meeting Kieran Devers.<br />In addition, the plot line was  not as &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; as her previous recent novels. I was  pleased with the refreshing change of pace for Small. I eagerly await  Small's next book in the series. I am looking forward to see how Autumn  Rose grows up.	2000-03-09

From the descriptions, Falcon was a large man while Jasmine was small.  I realized she could be infuriating but that  wasn't a reason for him to hit her. Otherwise, I enjoyed the mysticism and  the political intrigue of King John's court. Henley's research of Matilda  DeBraose (sp ?) is supported by books written by Barbara Erskine.  This  book could have been better.  I enjoyed Henley's recent releases (Dream  Lover, A Year and A Day, and A Woman of Passion) much more.	2000-01-14
US	52375293	R1NJRA4N91SMTS	0380975351	123766976	Joining	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Wonderful Johanna Lindsey novel	I have read many of Johanna Lindsey's books (still trying to get a hold of some of her earlier novels) as well as many other romance novels.  I liked this book for several reasons.  First the story focused on the turbulent  relationship of the two main characters of the story (afterall I would not  want to marry someone with whom I had a very bad encounter at a young age.)   Second, I empathized with the heroine to a very strong degree.  Finally,  the story moved quickly and did not mince words.<br />On the other hand, for  those who prefer more sex in a romance novel, then JOINING is not for you.   To me, the story had a more realistic feel because of the heroine's inner  and the small focus on sex.   Overall, JOINING is light reading, good for a  nice day on the beach.	1999-06-18
US	52375293	R2NB66U8A5TD13	0449001806	172997404	The Innocent	Books	4	3	3	N	N	*Not* vintage Small	The Innocent is one of Bertrice Small's less descriptive stories.  The story was not bad; it just did not have the attention to detail found in Bertrice Small's earlier novels.  Throughout the story, I kept hoping for  more insights into the characters' personalities.  The story line was also  similar to her other earlier novels.<br />I believe that Bertrice Small's  agenda of two novels a year (one for Kensington/Zebra and one for  Ballantine/Fawcett) has her resorting to formula story lines.  I have been  reading Bertrice Small for many years and her more recent novels do not  have the same appeal as her novels written in the 70s and 80s.  Other  recommended books by Bertrice Small: The Kadin, Adora, Beloved, and of  course Skye O'Malley.  I was much more satisfied after reading the above  mentioned novels.	1999-06-11

US	52375293	RTERPJJ77YTS0	1575664321	37681134	Bedazzled (Skye's Legacy)	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Better than her other recent books	Although Bedazzled does not live up to other previous Bertrice Small books (Skye O'Malley, The Kadin, Adora) the book is still a good read.  Ms. Small follows a pattern of events similar to her previous stories, but she makes  attempts to stay true to the historical events in which the story takes  place.  <br />I enjoyed the relationship between India and Fortune, but  Jasmine's character seemed shallow in this story unlike Wild Jasmine.  I  also felt that if I had not read the previous books in the O'Malley Saga, I  would not have understood everything that happened in this story.  <br />Overall the book was a quick entertaining read but nothing new for  Bertrice Small. I did not give this story five stars because Ms. Small did  not give Bedazzled the same depth of story and character found in her  earlier novels.	1999-05-24

The characters were believable and the storyline was unusual.  I loved the cameo appearances by the Malory family.  Kelsey will fit into the Malory  family well.

However, the middle could have been done a little better.  I thought she wrote the beginning and the  end and then used the middle as a filler. I wanted to learn more about Lady  de Grey but the most time was spent describing the medieval events and not  enough on the past life regression. Although the story was not as well done  as Knight in Shining Armour, I would still recommend this book to those who  like Jude Deveraux.	1999-04-30

I read the book pretty fast, so maybe I missed the more annoying points of the book, but I still enjoyed the fast paced action.  I was happy to see a hero and a heroine who  were older than I am instead of the teenage heroines that seem to be so  prevalent in romance novels today. I really haven't seen much of a change  in her writing style over the past few books and I have come to look for  Amanda Quick's books as light diversions. I recommend this book only if you  have time to read it on one sitting.	1999-03-26

This book is a well written introduction to the culture of the Philippines. I was born and raised in the US but my ethnic background is Filipino and I am fluent in Tagalog. I didn't think I would need to prepare  for the trip to the Philippines. I could not have been more incorrect.  Unfortunately for me, I read this book after my trip. Roces and Roces  clearly explain the idiosyncrasies of the Filipino culture without  insulting Filipino people. I recommend this book to anyone who will embark  on a trip to the Philippines. One piece of advice: read the book *before*  the trip not after!	1998-11-18

The  book was riveting and I could not stop reading. Brooks tells the story in a  way that makes the reader keep going. I have since read other books about  Muslim women and I still find myself going back to this one because of her  clear and concise explanations. I was impressed by the fact she did nothing  to condemn the religion of Islam. I found that the biggest threat to American democracy is not from Islam but rather the radical fundamentalists in any religion.  This book  opens your eyes to the suffering of other people in other countries.	1998-09-03
