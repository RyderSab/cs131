It means exactly what it says. All cruisers and submarines, (today's third-rate line ships), are<BR>to be named for the Cities and Towns of the States of the<BR>Union. The current USS Yorktown, (CG-48), is a guided missile cruiser. The nuclear attack submarine USS Los Angeles, on the other hand, is another story. However, it<BR>conforms to US ship-naming policy. What about the first-rates? The ships-of-the-line, or battleships? Under U.S.<BR>law, they're named for the States of the Union. Unlike British<BR>ship naming policy, which is different from ours, they name<BR>their ships for cities. For example, HMS Belfast, is a battleship. Here, she'd be a cruiser. The first Yorktown was a sloop-of-war built at the Gosport, (Norfolk), Navy Yard, in<BR>1839, fitted out in 1840, commissioned in 1842, and sunk off the west coast of Africa in 1850, when she was part of a<BR>little-known chapter in American history---the U.S. Navy's Antislavery Patrol, which unlike Britain's, was unpopular because it was fighting the economic lifeblood of the South.<BR>Begun in the 1820s to crack down on the smuggling of slaves into the United States, it was unlike the Antipiracy Patrol in the Caribbean and ships were peeled away from the less glamorous, ugly, stepsister, the Antislavery Patrol.<BR>The second Yorktown was a steam-driven schooner-rigged<BR>small cruiser, although she was classified as a gunboat.<BR>She served in the Navy from 1888 until 1919 when she was<BR>sold for scrap.

This is the first book about an American sea captain since C.S. Forester's THE CAPTAIN FROM CONNECTICUT. However, Josiah Peabody, the hero of that book, was forty-seven years later than Biddlecomb.

Needless to say, Biddlecomb and Rumstick are pressed into the Royal Navy by an incompetent boob named Lieutenant James Pendexter.<BR>Pendexter's sole claim to fame, is his relationship to Admiral Samuel Graves, the commander of  the North American Squadron.

He impresses Biddlecomb and Rumstick and starts flogging the crew. Biddlecomb and Rumstick lead a mutiny against<BR>Pendexter and his sadistic first officer Smeaton after a voyage to the West Indies. When the Icarus returns to American waters, the Rose picks up the chase and Biddlecomb and a handful of other mutineers escape.	2001-12-12

I first read it when I was in the 8th grade and I loved it. I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in reading it. To the kid and his teacher who think it's boring, I say WAKE UP! Kid, you need to get to bed earlier. You were probably tired from watching late night television. Teach, I suggest you read the whole thing through.	2001-08-05

I've been from Regina, Saskatchewan, to Lake Powell, Utah, and from California to Casco Bay, with stops in Illinois, the San Francisco Bay Area,  Denver, Colorado, and Mitchell, South Dakota. The first time I read this book, it took me places I've never been before. It's a well-written traveler's tale. William Least Heat Moon's book about his travels on the blue highways, (back roads), of the United States in the 1980s, was and still is<br />the ultimate.	2001-08-05

The Brightons are your typical American family with one major, glaring exception, they're not the Brightons. They're fugitives on the lam from the law. Why? They were framed by a corrupt FBI agent for murders they didn't commit. They were part of an envrionmental cleanup team at a Super Fund site in Arkansas. the Ulysses S. Grant Ammunition Plant, which had been closed down in 1965 by President Johnson. Jake and Carolyn were involved in the clean up of the site when a bomb went off killing their companions. When they escaped, they were shot at by a sniper. The corrupt FBI agent, a man named Peter Frankel, is now the Assistant Director of the FBI, and he has a vested interest in arresting the Brightons for the crime that he and his henchman had committed. Carolyn's uncle, who'd practically raised her from when she was a little girl, had one of his employees, a man named Thorne, supply them with everything they needed for a life in hiding. He even told them not to have a kid because of the complications it would cause. The book starts off slowly and then picks up. Jake Brighton's the manager of the service department of a Good Ole Boy's Ford dealership in South Carolina. That's when their perfect life falls apart. The FBI raids the dealership looking for drugs. He's arrested in the raid and taken to jail. His lawyer comes to believe he's innocent, and slowly, gradually, so does the FBI agent who arrested him. The climax is a gunfight and a posh private club in Washington, DC.	2001-08-03

The only galaxy in it is the Andromeda. The other two are the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud. Perhaps this one's been updated again. The copy I have is my brother's and it was last updated 30 years ago.	2001-07-23

It's a cautionary tale of vigilantism. Set in 1885, it's about the citizens of a town in Montana, many of them ranchers, who form a posse on their own, to go after cattle rustlers. Two innocent men are caught by the mob who then invite them to a necktie party, (a hanging), and one of the people in the mob tries to stop it realizing their mistake. He's shouted down and the hanging goes ahead in a pass known as the Ox-Bow. By the time it's over, the rest of the mob realizes too late that they've made a terrible mistake.	2001-07-01

The feel of the deck, smell of the gunpowder, the roar of the cannon. Makes you feel like you were on the HMS Hyperion. Richard Bolitho rocks! This is set during the Wars of the French Revolution. Bolitho gets command of the Hyperion, a British two-decker. The Revolutionary forces of France had just beheaded Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Toulon is under attack and British and allied forces are in full retreat. Bolitho and Hyperion are blockading Toulon while evacuating the French port. This book is reminiscent of Vietnam. The evacuation of Toulon's like the evacuation of Saigon in 1975.	2001-06-12
