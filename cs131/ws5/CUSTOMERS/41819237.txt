He was a classic Old China Hand, raised by missionary parents in China, a fluent speaker of the language, and a natural to serve in the State Department and as Army liaison during World War II.  The book combines period documents with later reflections, dazzling readers with thrilling adventures and portentous encounters with the era's major figures: Generalissimo and Madame Chiang, Stilwell, Mao, Zhou Enlai, Roosevelt, Marshall.  The 1948-9 Nationalist debacle sparked an anticommunist hunt for scapegoats blamed for \\"losing\\" China (it was never ours to lose), tragically depriving the US of wise counsel from Davies, John Service, Oliver Clubb, John Vincent and others.  As J.K. Fairbank noted, neither before nor since has America had such gifted country experts to advise on foreign policy.  Davies's view of a defense-minded Soviet Union again was more realistic than the official line which helped provoke the Cold War.  His globetrotting is a little hard to follow, and fuller coverage of post-1945 events would be welcome, but these are quibbles.  See L. Van Slyke ed, \\"The China White Paper.\\"  E. Sevareid, \\"Not so Wild a Dream\\" augments Davies's modest paragraph on their celebrated parachute jump and escape from Burma.  E.J. Kahn, \\"The China Hands\\" details wartime conflicts and postwar persecutions, while J.S. Service, \\"Lost Chance in China\\" contains prophetic field reports by Davies's most astute colleague.	2005-08-02

It helps explain the complex intellectual currents, political developments and socioeconomic conditions that led to the People's Republic of China.  Bianco stresses throughout the contingent nature of this process, rather than its inevitability, giving due attention to non-Communist actors.

Here he collects a huge amount of historical and current data on large-scale organized crime in East and Southeast Asia; drugs, prostitution, gambling, labor rackets, extortion, \\"protection,\\" kidnapping, piracy and smuggling are all covered.   He defines this difficult, even dangerous subject broadly, including Russia and activities of Asian gangsters in Australia and the USA, with plentiful background on the region to provide context.  Lintner discusses infamous secret societies and gangs such as the South China Triads, Japan's yakuza and the Qing Bang (Green Gang) of old Shanghai; their ties to law enforcement and governments; and roles in variously thwarting or promoting political change.  It is a pleasure to read an exciting work on an exciting topic, but there are some flaws.  Lintner uses interviews and published sources well, but seems to have done little archival research.  Some fine, better-documented works cover aspects of the topic: on Java, R. Cribb, \\"Gangsters & Revolutionaries;\\" B. Martin, \\"The Shanghai Green Gang;\\" and Pan Ling, \\"Old Shanghai,\\" by a native of the city.  Maps would greatly aid in understanding a vast geographical area, and illustrations are sorely missed (wouldn't you like to see how Huang, Du and Kwoi got their names?)  Finally, Lintner's grim, brutal tales may induce creeping paranoia and depression among readers.  \\"Blood Brothers\\" is hardly uplifting but still very worthwhile.	2005-06-30

These books have two main merits beyond the author's considerable literary gifts.  As a Byzantinist, he situates the Crusades in both European and Middle Eastern contexts, giving due attention to Muslim Turks and Arabs, Jews, Greeks, Armenians and other Eastern Christians, and he uses Eastern sources quite well.  Other histories typically treat the crusading phenomenon mostly as an episode in Europe's development, but Runciman aptly sees it as a major world-historical phenomenon.  The rich narrative combines storytelling with analysis of historical controversies.  It is not a complete tale of all medieval Crusades, since he mostly omits wars against Muslim Spain, Eastern Slavs, Christian heretics, and crusading episodes after the fall of Acre in 1291.  But this &#34;limited&#34; focus on the eastern Mediterranean makes the work tighter and more coherent. Other historians like K. Setton & H. Mayer retain much of Runciman's analytical framework, though their interpretations vary.  Successors like J. Riley-Smith present some valid critiques and expand the scope with more coverage of non-Levantine crusades, but again restrict crusading to its traditional European context.  Volumes 2 and 3 on the Kingdoms of Jerusalem and Acre are also superb, but they seem less novel after the unprecedented events of the First Crusade.  More recent studies (e.g. by C. Tyerman & R-S) challenge some of Runciman's judgements, but much of the basic research stands up well enough.  T. Asbridge, &#34;The First Crusade&#34; is now probably the premier analytical narrative. The most intriguing alternatives on the Crusades present non-European views, e.g. A. Maalouf, &#34;The Crusades Through Arab Eyes;&#34; A. Dostourian & K. Maksoudian, &#34;Armenia & the Crusades;&#34; P. Frankopan, &#34;The Call from the East;&#34; and especially C.

David Bergamini's research on the seamy history of Japan's imperial family and household is hardly flawless, but it's massive enough that he substantially proves their culpability for much of the horror Japan inflicted on Asia since 1868.  Critics rightly note some errors in using sources, and his argument is overstated.  While Bergamini stresses the personal role of the Imperial family, structural/systemic elements of Japan's militarism and attitudes toward other peoples (not innate national character) deserve more attention.  But earlier withering reviews also reflect scholarly disapproval of his lack of academic credentials -- not to mention his assault on the conventional &#34;wisdom,&#34; especially about Hirohito, one of history's greatest unpunished war criminals.  This book deserves a new edition, but later studies benefit from access to recently available data.  Sterling Seagrave offers similar journalistic accounts of the same era, and he has built a sterling (sic) career scourging modern Asia's corrupt authoritarians (&#34;Soong Dynasty,&#34; &#34;Marcos Dynasty,&#34; &#34;Yamato Dynasty&#34; & the recent, disturbing &#34;Gold Warriors&#34;).  H. Bix, &#34;Hirohito & the Making of Modern Japan&#34; sets the current standard because he used material released after Hirohito's death, as well as American MAGIC intelligence.  T. Yoshida, &#34;The Making of 'The Rape of Nanking'&#34; has recently covered the critiques of &#34;JIC.&#34;  Still, Bergamini deserves credit for interpretations of Japan's overall conduct of military and foreign policy largely upheld by later writers.	2005-04-24

They include feminists, journalists, trade unionists, socialists, anarchists and other activists and dissenters---in sum, major elements of any flourishing civil society.  Taken together their stories reveal the extent of nonconformist opinion in prewar Japan, and the vigorous struggle against militarism and the oppressive patriarchy of post-Meiji Japan.  As the title suggests, these spirited women lost out in the short run (though few were actually executed), as did all Japan and much of Asia, where aggressive imperialism -- first European, then Japanese -- led to the catastrophe of the Pacific War.  If only such dissenters had had greater influence....  In the middle run, Japan currently enjoys a rather more open, if still far from ideal, civic culture.  As for the future---well, who knows?  In the words of JM Keynes, in the long run we're all dead anyway.	2005-04-16

Woodson Institute Series)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	A Dedicated Historian's Final Testament	The late Armstead Robinson was a gifted, committed scholar. Writing apparently did not come easily to him; his mountain of data, painstaking methods and final illness delayed this book's appearance til after his passing. This long-awaited posthumous revision of his PhD thesis took years to complete, but is worth the wait.  A wealth of detail supports his findings on the scope of resistance and internal dissent in the Confederacy.  While it is not the last word on this subject, it advances debate in numerous ways.  One key question concerns African American participants in the Southern cause.  They mostly contributed under duress, had close social ties to white neighbors or were wealthy slaveowners themselves.  This important issue deserves fuller treatment.  Black rebels were an interesting phenomenon, but the tiny percentages of willing volunteers made them statistically insignificant.  Most of the book focuses on Southern whites anyway, making an convincing argument for the scale and importance of anti-Confederate opposition.  Neo-Confederate reviewers dishonor the memory of a dedicated historian who cannot defend his work against distortions. 25 years ago L. Litwack's &#34;Been In The Storm So Long&#34; revealed slaves' hatred of the Confederacy and ardent welcome of freedom.  W. Jordan, &#34;Tumult & Silence at Second Creek&#34; tells how Mississippi planters brutally crushed a major wartime slave conspiracy.  W.

It explores the paradox of using the army to build national identity with forced enlistment from marginal social groups---including convicts, vagrants and homosexuals.  The army became a feared fighting force, but mostly by crushing internal rebels and smaller neighbors like Paraguay, not first-rate opponents.  Brazilians came to dread military service, avoiding it whenever possible, and eventually a less arbitrary recruitment system emerged.  Beattie paints a convincing picture of the evolution of a major institution in modern Brazil.  His broad approach to evidence, deploying an impressive array of conventional and innovative sources, further displays the potential of this new military history.  T. Whigham's \\"I Die With My Country\\" and \\"The Paraguayan War\\" have important new material on the War of the Triple Alliance.  The army's bloody role in suppressing dissent is covered, often brilliantly, in R. Levine, \\"Vale of Tears,\\" T. Diacon, \\"Millenarian Vision, Capitalist Reality,\\" and especially E. da Cunha, \\"Rebellion in the Backlands.\\"  S. Caulfield, \\"In Defense of Honor\\" is another fresh view of Brazilian society in the same era, but Beattie really does offer something new.	2005-03-13

The rhythm of the seasons, work routines, knowledge of livestock, nature and people too, combine for a profound view of a vanished America.  (If you want to really know about mules, Ned's the man.)  But Ned didn't just observe, he worked with the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union and defended powerless friends, serving 12 years in prison after being shot for his pains.  This activism sets him apart from Kas Maine, a South African sharecropper to whom he's been compared in recent years.  The earthy dialect wears out some readers, but otherwise &#34;All God's Dangers&#34; is compelling from start to end.  Writers from Wendell Berry to Pete Daniel praise both man and book, while John Beecher's &#34;In Egypt Land&#34; is a moving poetic rendition of Ned's story.  R. Kelley, &#34;Hammer & Hoe&#34; vividly recreates 1930s Alabama; on Kas Maine, see C. Van Onselen, &#34;The Seed Is Mine.&#34; But Ned tells about his world far better than the others.  In living, then narrating, a life of great struggle lived with great dignity, Ned Cobb performed a signal service --- for all of us.  We are in your debt!	2005-02-23

Gallagher spent decades researching a subject central to Franklin Roosevelt's career and personal life, and as a fellow \\"polio,\\" Warm Springs client and wheelchair user, his insider's view permits unmatched insights.  Gallagher supports most scholars who see FDR's struggle with disability as the key to his character and political ascent, but he pushes his inquiries further than others, shedding new light on FDR and those close to him.  The photos are truly startling in what they reveal about FDR's health, and the author excels at analyzing the careful poses which helped hide the disability.  Both press and public aided their own self-deception in ways that are now unthinkable; any and all aspects of public lives are fair game these days.  Gallagher is both straightforward and sensitive on such matters as FDR's sex life and the challenges of physical mobility.  Some flaws exist: his treatment of psychological and health factors is superb, but he's less careful about better-known parts of FDR's story, and minor factual errors creep in.  Also, much remains unknown about such a private public figure, so even the most acute conclusions are often guesswork.  Still, this concise work is a riveting look at \\"a great American, a disabled American.\\"  While it mentions politics only incidentally, it is highly suggestive about vital matters such as the infirmity of leaders and the electorate's right to know.	2005-02-07

It preserves a most diverse array of material, including pamphlets, newspaper articles and court transcripts, but also less conventional sources such as flyers, broadsheets, cartoons, and labor ballads.  Kornbluh portrays the IWW as a dynamic, vital force fighting for workplace democracy and civil rights from 1905 to 1917, an era of bleak prospects for labor.  The IWW ultimately succumbed to concerted government and employers' repression: violence, propaganda, punitive trials, and deportations.  Many of the Wobblies' goals were later achieved through reform during and after the New Deal, but they left an inspiring activist legacy.  The pictorial matter and music are especially revealing, and help illustrate the old adage that the government and bosses may have the money, guns and victories, but the workers have the best songs.  Cf. M. Dubofsky, &#34;We Shall Be All,&#34; a thorough narrative and analysis.  More recent studies include G. Hall, &#34;Harvest Wobblies,&#34; N. Sellars, &#34;Oil, Wheat & Wobblies&#34; and J.A.

It does have some problems of organization and repetition, as others note.  Overly harsh critics probably assume that this is a conventional, event-oriented tale of the riots themselves, but Bernstein's forte is analysis rather than narrative. He explains their context, causes and importance for understanding urban tensions in an era of intense stuggles over freedom, industrialization, work, wages, immigration, assimilation and exclusion.  He tells the story well enough (though a coherent chronology is hard to locate), focusing on what it reveals about a period of fundamental change in US history.  See also T.

Presumably they wanted to try something different, and they acquit themselves conscientiously as always.  But much of this book is so problematic that the whole project trivializes the practice of history.  Counterfactual exercises can have genuine value apart from mere diversion.  But too many contributors here are inattentive to logical implications, sloppy with facts, and downright biased toward particular outcomes.  Counterfactuals are generally handled better by philosophers of history (usually philosophers), who thoroughly explore real probabilities and control for numerous variables.  The presence of macho blowhards (Stephen Ambrose and John Keegan, sometime respected historians) and rightwing cranks (Victor Davis Hanson) is a telling sign. Arthur Waldron's chapter on China is sorely disappointing after his fine \\"Great Wall of China.\\"  Here he rehashes McCarthyite loss-of-China nonsense and smears George C. Marshall, whose sage but rejected assessment of 1940s China reinforced his reputation as a great public servant. And now the ultimate reactionary fantasy: not only does Robert E. Lee win at Gettysburg, he gets to defend the high ground against fruitless Union assaults!  That laughable scenario will warm the hearts of neo-Confederates everywhere; just imagine them getting off on that fantasy---hence \\"pornography\\" in the review title.  For a truly historical, and enlightening, counterfactual approach, see N. Lawler, \\"Soldiers, Airmen, Spies & Whisperers: The Gold Coast in World War II.\\"  Her work succeeds precisely because she considers actual policy options weighed by the Allies in the dark days of the war.  \\"What If's\\" many flights of fancy simply reveal that provocative isn't the same as thought-provoking.	2005-01-08

The result is a rare achievement, a solid full-length study of a precolonial African woman.  Dona Beatriz was a young woman who inspired a religious movement against the internal wars which overwhelmed the Kingdom of Kongo in the Atlantic slave trade era.  Her charismatic leadership ran afoul of civil authorities and the Catholic Church and she was executed in 1706, but echoes of the movement endured for several decades both in West Central Africa and the New World.  The author answers important questions on cultural syncretism, women's political and spiritual roles, and the adaptation of world religions to indigenous settings.  The main drawback is the welter of unfamiliar kiKongo place and personal names, which unavoidably frustrate some readers.  A future edition could address this with more detailed maps, a glossary and list of main actors.  Thornton skillfully provides more context in &#34;Africa & Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World,&#34; and the more recent &#34;Cultural History of the Atlantic World.&#34;	2004-08-25

Continent Ablaze is thus a good addition to Africa's military history. Turner deftly, even exuberantly, describes the continent's bitter and protracted conflicts, with coverage heavily weighted toward the Apartheid wars involving South Africa. Time spent observing the South African Defense Force bolsters his reading. This feel for combat strengthens the book, but also crucially weakens it because his judgements often reflect the views of the SADF and others who fought majority rule in southern Africa. Turner knows the politics of these struggles; he details the origins of conflicts and peace talks, and remarks briefly on how war affected ordinary people. But his zest for counterinsurgency limits readers' grasp of the political dimensions, particularly the violence and hardship endured by civilians. South Africa and its surrogates upheld cruel and illegal governments, committing plenty of atrocities (as did many opponents) in a doomed contest against African nationalism. The tales of military ops are fine, but this one-dimensional work must be read with more critical, sensitive accounts. See R. Kapuscinski, Another Day of Life (Angola); N. Kriger, Zimbabwe's Guerrilla War; R. Gordon, The Bushman Myth (Namibia); C. Nordstrom, A Different Kind of War Story (Mozambique); and S. Nolutshungu, Limits of Anarchy (Chad).	2004-07-28

After his \\"man-of-action\\" days, he shaped colonial policies til his death in 1945; his major statements came in this 1922 work, the bible of British Indirect Rule.  Today Lord Lugard's naive ethnocentrism and even crude racism are clear enough.  Many facts and suggestions in this hoary \\"current affairs\\" book are also naturally dated, but even harsh critics tacitly share the basic principles Lugard outlined.  Briefly, the \\"dual mandate\\" says that foreign powers have a duty to develop Africa's resources to benefit both Africa and the whole world.  In reality European empires (also the US) set most economic policy in their favor, but since Africa must still engage with the world to sell its products, the challenge remains crucial.  Most later development strategies accepted this implicitly, but much recent exploitation of Africa's wealth drops any pretense of aiding people---witness the endless conflicts in resource-rich Congo and Sudan, and corporate collusion in Nigeria.  Despite biases, Lugard deserves credit for frankly assessing Africa's complex global role.  M. Perham's \\"Lugard\\" admiringly tells his story in two bulky volumes.  Powerful critiques came often, notably in classics by Kwame Nkrumah, Thomas Hodgkin and Basil Davidson.  Pan-Africanism's economic nationalism offers a sharp contrast, if not a very practical alternative.	2004-03-13

There he noted a fundamental transformation preceding &#34;The Columbian Exchange&#34; described by Alfred Crosby.  Islam unified much of the Middle East and Asia, enabling the transfer of valuable plants and farming techniques within the Muslim world.  Some crops, such as sorghum from Africa, traveled farther east.  But many others came west to enrich the diets and economies of the Mediterranean, Europe and ultimately the Americas several centuries later.  These included most citrus fruits, mangos, Asiatic rice and especially cotton and sugar cane, which both led to major changes in economy, population distribution and vegetation cover.  Knowledge and technology transfer included a variety of sophisticated irrigation methods and new forms of land tenure.  Watson's article deftly outlined the process; the book is not a complete transition to the fuller genre and resembles an extended essay, but adds detail in cataloging crops and techniques.  What he first called &#34;the Arab agricultural revolution&#34; is more properly dubbed Islamic here, since many non-Arabs contributed to the innovations.  Overall, Watson identifies a crucial development in world history that is still neglected ---  perhaps because the book was not in print very long.	2004-01-11

Most are poor, of course, but this work on rural-urban mobility in Niger documents a centuries-old way of maximizing labor and resources following each rainy season.  This is not news, since fine earlier research by Ken Swindell and Polly Hill, among others, found similar patterns, but David Rain's data provides a new level of concreteness on the topic.  His fieldwork in villages and the city of Maradi is precise, though the sheer amount of detail is rather overwhelming at times.  But it clearly shows Nigeriens' resilience and ingenuity, with circular migration vital to their risk-aversion strategies.  Significantly, Rain locates migrants themselves at the center of his study, not the usual official statistics or theories of development experts.  He summarizes surveys and paraphrases interviews well, with many men (and some women) emerging as individuals, though their stories would be further enhanced with more of their own words.  For this see N. Cross & R. Barker eds, \\"At the Desert's Edge\\" which covers the whole Sahel region.  There is a wonderful social history in B. Cooper, \\"Marriage in Maradi,\\" while W. Miles, \\"Hausland Divided\\" notes interesting contrasts between Francophone Niger and Anglophone Nigeria.  N.B. The dust jacket does not list Rain as having a professional position; \\"Eaters\\" is certainly strong enough to earn him a good job in his field.	2004-01-10

Lyons's book adds greatly to our understanding of efforts to control the \\"fly,\\" not least because she very effectively exploits Belgian, British and Sudanese archives.  As a full study of policy and practice in the major colony of the Belgian Congo, it also adds an important dimension to the history of African environments, previously dominated by research on British Africa.  The main contrast between the two approaches was that Britain sought to control tsetse-friendly areas by modifying the landscape, basically waging war against vegetation, while Belgium sought to minimize infection among human populations through forced resettlement and coercive quarantine measures.  This enhanced Africans' resentment and sense of injury under Belgian rule, but both policies barely grasped how colonial-era changes aided the spread of fly belts.  \\"Colonial Disease\\" is a fine if primarily documentary study, and would probably be better with more access to materials in Congo/Zaire.  Though it has some good interview data, its fieldwork component is less strong than J. Giblin, \\"The Politics of Environmental Control in Northeastern Tanzania,\\" and the forbidding classic by J. Ford, \\"The Role of the Trypanosomiases in African Ecology.\\"  F.

The (UCal) Berkeley School---Woodrow Borah, Sherburne Cook, Lesley Simpson, and Carl Sauer---pioneered the systematic study of Indian population decline, and also explored patterns of land exploitation in New Spain.  Melville extends this work with in-depth use of Mexican and Spanish archives, focusing on the Valle del Mezquital north of Mexico City.  She shows how Spaniards used depopulated Indian lands for sheep raising, leading to overgrazing, degradation and vegetation change.  Formerly fertile lands were colonized by invasive mesquite scrub (thus Valle del Mezquital), making the region largely unproductive until irrigation in the 20th century.  Thorough documentation makes this a most concrete study of Mexican land use history, and while the writing is not exciting, it is quite readable.  An interesting chapter compares Australia's experience with sheep to the Valle, but it distracts readers from the too-brief core of the book and ultimately seems misplaced.  Since this book appeared, Melville has taken up the larger issue of capitalism's impact on Latin American environments with a chapter in T. Griffith & L.

Combining anecdote and informed expertise (he's written several books on Southeast Asia) pushes this book beyond a typical academic study.  The data on which \\"Indonesian Destinies\\" is based is both broad and deep (perhaps too deep: Java gets more space than the outer islands), covering most facets of Indonesian history since World War Two.  Friend also has a knack for addressing the issues informed US citizens associate with Indonesia --- to the extent we think about this crucially important country at all: oil, gas, minerals and other economic resources; environmental concerns; Islamic radicalism; and perhaps most important, the ongoing internal struggle for a more just political culture and civil society, including the recent Timor tragedy.  Abbreviated time-depth means that the work is not truly comprehensive, and thus complements other major studies, instead of supplanting them.  These include J.G. Taylor, \\"Indonesia: Peoples & Histories,\\" stronger on pre-1900 history, from an Australian perspective; and A. Reid, \\"Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce,\\" which masterfully examines regional structures and continuities.  Friend's lively if sometimes glib study sets a high standard, at least until Indonesians themselves are permitted to reach a global audience with their own interpretations.  For this, one can begin with the novels by Pramoedya Ananta Toer, along with \\"The Mute's Soliloquy,\\" his collection of prison and political writings. There is also Kartini, \\"Letters of a Javanese Princess,\\" by the sadly shortlived but pioneering Indonesian feminist from a century ago.	2003-09-26

But there is much more to commend Moodie and Ndatshe's exploration of what it means to be a man, and to act like one, in South Africa.  Their intimate knowledge of the region combines well with participant-observer data, which must have been challenging to collect given the subject and circumstances.  The result is one of the richest current studies of migrant life in Africa, encompassing changes in the labor process, ethnic identity, class formation, drinking and sociability, violence, and resistance to harsh work and living conditions.  For example, the sections on faction fights between Sotho and Xhosa miners reveal that these are not merely age-old primordial hatreds.  They reflect complex antagonisms rooted in struggles for employment, occupational status, class consciousness, political affiliation and situational identity, which all have discernible recent origins.  While the book is pathbreaking, others have taken up these issues in various ways.  In order of expanding regional scale, see C. Van Onselen, \\"Studies in the Social & Economic History of the Witwatersrand;\\" P. Harries, \\"Work, Culture & Identity;\\" R. Morrell ed, \\"Changing Men in Southern Africa;\\" J. Crush & C.

In this instance, the long hiatus enabled him to write an even finer book, with mature reflection leading to better insights.  It exemplifies the New Military History, with more attention given to what happens behind the front, greater focus on the ordinary rank-and-file, and examination of the effects of militarization on society at large.  With Nyasaland/Malawi's dense population, it was a prime recruiting ground for askaris (soldiers) and even more for tengatenga (the Carrier Corps) who performed vital military labor in horrendous conditions throughout 1914-18.  Malawian combat troops earned a deserved, if partly stereotyped, reputation for courage.  Page shows clearly that forced migration and withdrawal of large amounts of labor from rural districts led to food shortages, changes in the gender division of labor, the spread of infectious disease, and a famous 1915 rebellion led by John Chilembwe.  \\"Chiwaya War\\" also demonstrates how the oral data available in each generation changes over time; the author's 1970s field sojourn was probably the last chance to interview appreciable numbers of former carriers, askaris and their wives.  It has a much deeper grasp of Africans' experience of war than the standard battle-oriented accounts of the East African campaign like C. Miller, \\"Battle for the Bundu\\" and L. Mosley, \\"Duel for Kilimanjaro.\\"  Such a close study of Malawi's wartime ordeal will never be possible again, unless it draws heavily on Page's own data.  A similar work on Senegal is J. Lunn, \\"Memoirs of the Maelstrom.\\"  On Chilembwe, see G. Shepperson & T. Price, \\"Independent African\\" and L. White, \\"Magomero.\\"  A good recent study of military life in East Africa is T.

Berry's many years of field and archival research in Nigeria give great strength to the book, but she also masterfully uses the literature on the other countries she discusses (Zambia, Kenya, Ghana). She is interested throughout in complexity: the varied impacts of foreign and state intervention in household and regional economies; the ways people organize access to land, labor, capital and other critical resources; and how they have dealt with natural and social constraints along with opportunities for growth.  Since the paths to economic development are quite diverse (and not guaranteed), the analysis is necessarily nuanced, a fact that would escape someone who \\"knocks off\\" the book in an evening.  \\"No Condition\\" is very well-written, but since Berry is more literary technician than stylist, its considerable rewards are intellectual rather than aesthetic.  Since it was published, further important material has appeared to shed more light on her case studies.  On Northern Zambia, see H. Moore & M. Vaughan, \\"Cutting Down Trees.\\" On Western Nigeria, there is J.

It is virtually unknown, partly because it had several discrete episodes, but also because the French authorities covered it up to avoid negative propaganda during World War I. Until now, that is; Saul and Royer's very thoroughly researched book fixes the war permanently in the minds of Africanists. They make full use of extensive evidence from the colonial archives, including detailed accounts of punitive expeditions along with copies of campaign sketch maps. But the real strength of \\"West African Challenge To Empire\\" lies in their close familiarity with the region (southwest Mali/western Burkina Faso) and rich field data. This shows how much long-term planning went into the War; it was not a precipitate response to military and labor drafts, though these helped provoke it. The Volta-Bani peoples also drew quite effectively on indigenous institutions and networks of support for their war effort, which as a largely guerrilla struggle was defeated by France only with the greatest difficulty.<br />This book presents a challenge to military buffs because of the extensive detail, containing many unfamiliar names of peoples and places. This is due to the authors' deliberate choice to include an exhaustive chronicle of military operations in this first full treatment of the subject. (The modern maps are less than ideal for locating the many large and small settlements mentioned in the text.) But the reader's patience will be rewarded with a truer understanding of both the African encounter with colonialism and why people rise up against apparently more powerful enemies. Burkinabes and Malians will absolutely love this work for the great masses of information on areas which are seldom described in print. But they must have an edition in an accessible language---meaning French in this Francophone region of Africa, since it'sprobably too much to hope for translations into More (Burkina Faso) or Bambara/Mande (Mali). As noted, there is little else in English on the subject, but A. Hampate Ba, \\"The Fortunes of Wangrin\\" brilliantly conveys the atmosphere of Afrique Ouest Francais. \\"Banditry, Rebellion and Protest in Africa,\\" edited by D. Crummey, addresses major themes in the historiography of resistance.	2003-08-11

The book will hold it even more when s/he begins reading. \\"The South African War\\" is now the best general work on its subject, deftly summarizing twenty years of research since Thomas Pakenham's \\"The Boer War.\\" <br />Bill Nasson made a strong contribution with his earlier \\"Abraham Esau's War,\\" detailing how Black South Africans in the Cape Colony embraced the ideals of British liberal democracy, and fought and died for them. This book expands on that solid base, covering the whole war in a 300-page text, but omitting nothing of importance. It has four main virtues: balance, concision, comprehensiveness and humanity. Humanity is apparent in Nasson's scrupulous fairness to all three peoples (Afrikaners, Blacks, British) trapped in the horrors of the war, though he does criticize civilian and military leaders whose misguided ambition helped start and prolong it. It is balanced and comprehensive in covering all facets of the struggle, including economic origins, political dimensions, the experiences of soldiers and civilians alike, and the aftermath of peace. As a synthesis, it has less primary documentation than a monograph like \\"Esau,\\" but Nasson's intimate knowledge of South Africa and the relevant archives is clear throughout.<br />If there is a (minor) weakness, it lies in the succinct nature of the text: there is no room for a detailed military narrative. For this, Pakenham is still helpful, though it is itself incomplete in coverage of Africans' roles, the main achievement of recent scholarship. On this crucial subject Nasson is more enlightening, though other works are useful such as P. Warwick, \\"Black People and the South African War.\\" Also highly recommended is a diary (with various editions and titles) from the siege of Mafeking by Sol Plaatje, an early nationalist and writer who helped found the African National Congress in 1912. \\"South African War\\" succeeds as a sound analysis of a struggle which presaged many of the problems of both modern southern Africa and modern war. One of Nasson's main conclusions, that the war's primary victims were Blacks both during and after the fighting, is borne out by most major writers; see e.g. J. Krikler, \\"Revolution From Above, Rebellion From Below.\\" It is skillfully written and conveys all the drama, and trauma, of an oft-mythologized but vicious conflict.	2003-08-11

Furnivall produced an impressive body of work, with this early study standing in for the better known \\"Colonial Policy and Practice\\" (a classic in both 1948 and 1956 editions). It compares British Burma, where the author was an official for many years, and Dutch Indonesia.  Furnivall was a fine exemplar of the late colonial scholar-official, along with such luminaries as E.B. Worthington, Pierre Gourou, Paul Mus, Lord Hailey and Margery Perham. While the author of \\"Colonial Policy and Practice\\" fully explores many aspects of administration and life in the two colonies, his most enduring contribution lies in identifying and explaining the distinctive composite character of colonial societies. In Burma, Indonesia and many other territories, different ethnic groups enjoyed unequal political rights, and had social contacts only within the most rigid conventions. But their economic roles required them to interact in that sphere, and compelled some form of accommodation. The tensions that arose in most such societies endure uneasily to this day.<br />Furnivall's analysis emphasizes the vertical stratification of colonies, in contrast to focus on horizontal stratification preferred by succeeding generations of Marxist scholars. The notion of plural society or economy was often attacked, with some justification, for relative neglect of class relations, and Furnivall's work (including the earlier \\"Netherlands India\\") fell into disfavor in the 1970s and 80s. But the recent resurgence of ethnic conflicts throughout the world now makes his view very prescient, if not prophetic, since many if not all such conflicts occur in former colonies (Rwanda, Somalia, Congo, Fiji, Sri Lanka, India/Pakistan, Chechnya, etc.)	2003-06-17

The \\"Papers\\" are fundamentally important not only in terms of content, of course, but even more so in contrast to the public statements of our leaders explaining the purpose and progress of the war. While this makes the (self-)deception and lies clear enough, it is the internal dialogue of bureaucratic thinking that is most fascinating. <br />The format of \\"The Pentagon Papers\\" is a bit confusing, with primary documents mixed into the main narrative, but not always in a distinguishable manner. The sheer bulk of the material will naturally deter many readers, but it does repay the effort and is superior to various abridgements. While the expurgated editions are useful, the nature of the selection process gives them an episodic quality, and tends to highlight dramatic incidents rather than the all-important mundane character of bureaucracy, even on life and death matters of global import.<br />Daniel Ellsberg, who released the papers to the press, may well have some unheroic qualities about him. But his greatness lay in transcending the constraints of background and institutional context, and recognizing a higher duty to his country and humanity. Not only the substance of \\"The Pentagon Papers\\" ensures their significance, but also Ellsberg's example of public service. This is vitally important in a time when yet another presidential administration deceives us all in pursuit of fatally flawed military adventures. Who will be the Daniel Ellsberg of the so-called \\"war on terror?\\"<br />Some of the issues raised by \\"The Pentagon Papers\\" and Ellsberg's career are addressed in N.

This prizewinning study is a concise but thoroughly-researched look at the military experience in 19th and 20th-century West Africa, largely based on archival materials but making effective use of key oral interviews. France's empire was the most militarized in all Africa, with universal male conscription during much of the 20th century. By withdrawing labor from the rural economy and deploying it elsewhere, this draft had a heavy impact on the region. Echenberg's analysis thus is central to understanding West African life under colonial rule. He further demonstrates the importance of the slave origins of soldiers, many of whom attained freedom by joining the Tirailleurs Senegalais (recruited throughout West African territories, not just Senegal). Tirailleurs, or \\"sharpshooters,\\" fought with distinction in France's colonial conflicts and both World Wars, suffering heavy casualties on the Western Front, and imprisonment and discrimination during 1940-45. Echenberg also examines the significant contribution of veterans to postwar nationalist movements. Overall, this is a highly readable and succinct book, perhaps too succinct. The account of the epochal 1944 Thiaroye soldiers' uprising is overly brief, and Echenberg could also say more about the domestic and social life of army families. On Thiaroye, see his chapter in P. Gutkind ed., \\"African Labor History,\\" and Ousmane Sembene's memorable film \\"Camp de Thiaroye.\\" Cf. also N. Lawler, \\"Soldiers of Misfortune;\\" J.

E.B. Worthington is among the most fascinating people who worked in the continent. A Cambridge-trained biologist, he quickly took to the young field of ecology, and devoted most of his professional career to its service. In his 90s he is still lively, even dynamic, challenging much younger folks to keep up with him. \\"Science in Africa\\" was commissioned along with Lord Hailey, \\"An African Survey\\" and S.H. Frankel, \\"Capital Investment in Africa.\\" Worthington traveled through much of Africa in the 1930s, working closely with Hailey (who saved his life once in an auto-maintenance mishap). \\"Science in Africa\\" presents the author's own research (Cf. \\"Inland Waters of Africa\\") but draws even more on Worthington's prodigious surveys of nearly all Africanist literature at that time. It defines science very broadly, covering the earth, life and exact sciences but also encompassing public health, agronomy, economics, sociology, geography and the distinctively colonial sciences of anthropology and ecology. It goes beyond summarizing research to make recommendations for applying this accumulated knowledge to improve African life and economic production. The book is both invaluable and inimitable, except by EBW himself, who produced an updated \\"Science in the Development of Africa\\" some 20 years later. A liberal, enlightened colonial official and a pioneering tropical ecologist, with a deep love and understanding of the continent.

But most bandits' careers lasted one, two, perhaps three years at most before being snuffed out by the (so-called) forces of law and order. But Lampaio (Virgulino Ferreira) was a successful bandit for 16 years, from 1922-38 in Northeast Brazil, a drought-prone region of great poverty and inequality that was long a fertile breeding ground for banditry. By that standard alone, he surely was one of the greatest. He was extremely shrewd and resourceful, and one reason for his longevity was that he avoided clashes with armed opponents whenever possible, though he could fight well when he had to.<br /><br />Chandler superbly recreates the life and times of Lampiao, and due to the timing of his investigations this effort is unlikely to be surpassed. His 1970s research led him to many people who knew or encountered Lampaio, and his oral data becomes more valuable with each eyewitnesses' passing. Chandler also uses a wide range of other sources, including police reports and other archival materials, newspaper articles, photographs, folktales and songs. Lampiao was among the best-documented bandits ever, partly because of the growth of various modern media during his lifetime, but also because he was something of a publicity hound, clearly relishing his notoriety and even negotiating with a film producer to play himself on screen (too bad it never happened!). But make no mistake: he was a very dangerous criminal, and an outlaw's life in the harsh Nordeste backlands was anything but romantic. Brazil's modernizing Vargas regime of the 1930s eventually tired of the disorder and bad press associated with banditry, and directed sufficient resources toward combating the phenomenon. By 1938 when he was betrayed, ambushed and beheaded, Lampiao was a throwback to an earlier era.<br /><br />One of the strengths of \\"The Bandit King\\" is Chandler's skill in addressing broader issues raised by Lampaio's career. The best-known is the question of social banditry. The archetypal social bandit for English-language readers is, of course, Robin Hood, and the myth of social bandits has them \\"robbing from the rich to give to the poor.\\" This rarely happened in history, and the author uncovered little reliable evidence that Lampaio ever redistributed wealth---except to himself, his band and supporters. But Chandler partially redefines social banditry by noting that bandits often were admired by the powerless who were at the mercy of corrupt officials and vicious policemen. Violent men who resisted an oppressive state could thus be heroes even to those they declined to help directly, and might even victimize. This book also fully documents a crucial but neglected aspect of successful bandits: they received protection from landowners and other powerful patrons, who might employ them to do their own dirty work.

Barring discovery of new sources, it is likely the best, if not last, word, and compares well with the finest Brazilian scholarship. More information on the Nordeste and its bandits is in R.

Landeg White is a gifted literary stylist, and this book often reads like a novel (when someone says that, make sure they're not thinking of \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"). It is a study of a village in southern Malawi (colonial Nyasaland) over 100+ years, but it is much more than that too.<br />White's sense of drama is aided by some highly dramatic personages who figure prominently in his story. The most famous is missionary-explorer David Livingstone, a perennially fascinating, complex and influential shaper of the continent's destiny. He visited Magomero, site of the ill-fated Universities' Mission to Central Africa, frequently on two expeditions in the 1850s and 1860s. White perceptively examines the ambiguities of Livingstone's antislavery crusade, not least the paradox of purchasing slaves in order to free them---thus inadvertently stimulating the market. But John Chilembwe is just as interesting: a Malawian Protestant minister and protonationalist who studied in the USA, founded an independent mission, and eventually died leading a doomed rebellion against British rule in 1915. The later chapters are not as event-oriented, but the lucid accounts of cash cropping and womens' work are probably more representative of daily life in the colonial era, and a major contribution to social and economic history.<br />\\"Magomero\\" does not have detailed source notes (they tend to scare off the mass audience White aims for here), but references to scholars' names without the titles of their works ensure that only specialists can swiftly identify White's sources. The other problem is that the author's own account of villagers' accepting his presence and explanation of his research is awkwardly unconvincing; it would be more credible in the words of Malawians themselves, without assuming that they care about associations with long-dead muzungus (Europeans). These minor faults aside, this is the most enjoyable scholarly book I've come across in nearly 20 years in African Studies. For more on the area's history, see E. Mandala, \\"Work and Control in a Peasant Economy\\" and M. Vaughan, \\"The Story of an African Famine.\\" G. Shepperson & T. Price, \\"Independent African,\\" a classic on Africa, tells the Chilembwe story with great depth and sensitivity.  For an authentic Nyasaland account based on oral data from participants in the Rising, see G.S. Mwase, \\"Strike a Blow and Die.\\"	2003-01-12

Grant : Memoirs and Selected Letters : Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant / Selected Letters, 1839-1865 (Library of America)	Books	5	32	34	N	N	Best book ever by a US President	Granted (sic) that there are few serious rivals (Jefferson's &#34;Notes on the State of Virginia&#34; and Eisenhower's &#34;Crusade in Europe&#34; come to mind but don't measure up), this is a remarkable literary achievement by an &#34;uncommon common man.&#34; Not only is it an indispensible, if not flawless, narrative of the cataclysmic events of the Civil War, the circumstances under which he wrote make its very creation a triumph of will and ability. As historian Brooks Simpson has noted, Grant's character was so complete that nobody could believe he was real. But he was, and the proof is in this book, which contains not only the &#34;Personal Memoirs&#34; but many invaluable letters revealing the man as well as the general. Though this edition lacks an introduction and other scholarly apparatus to enhance its value, the sheer scope of Grant's writings available here probably make it the best current presentation of his unparalleled view of the war. Also, the early chapters on the Mexican-American War (which he detested) are most enlightening in showing some of the sources of his future greatness.  There were two great tragedies of Grant's public life. First, American Indians and African Americans suffered greatly while he was president, and it was a shame that he didn't (couldn't?) do more on their behalf. But in fairness, could/would anyone else have done better? Probably not. The earlier tragedy was that he was prevented from winning the Civil War early on, by the jealous ambition of rival generals and the circumspect nature of Union strategy. Unfortunately, the impediments that led to the slaughter at Shiloh ensured that that battle would set the tone for the rest of the conflict. If Grant had been given free rein in 1862, several hundred thousand lives would have been saved---but without the abolition of slavery and Reconstruction, there would have been a different tragedy. General Grant made some grievous tactical errors during the war, but was able to learn from his mistakes. It's quite misleading to think of him as a heavy-handed butcher who prevailed by grinding down opponents no matter how many men he lost. By 1864 that may have been the only way to defeat Robert E. Lee. But Grant's victories before then were consistently marked by speed, boldness and strategic brilliance whenever he was permitted to act independently, as well as great sensitivity to carnage and death. Has any general ever been better at capturing enemy armies (and thus sparing lives), rather than bloodily smashing them? Perhaps the best way to compare Lee and Grant is to see the former as the last great general of the 18th century, while the latter was the first great one of the 20th century. (A.L. Conger, &#34;Rise of U.S. Grant&#34; helped begin the revival of his reputation; J.F.C. Fuller, &#34;Grant & Lee&#34; is a well-balanced comparison.) But the &#34;Memoirs&#34; document---with artless modesty---Grant's consummate skill at maneuver well before he introduced modern total war. They also contain the classic passage about Appomattox, wherein Grant summarized the entire war in one immortal sentence: &#34;I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse&#34; (p.735).  Grant's great skill at turning a phrase, along with shrewd insights and dry humor, is well-displayed throughout the &#34;Memoirs&#34; and letters. It's true that there are some inaccuracies, because while he did have access to important documents when writing, his race against death resulted in some errors due to haste, and some inevitably faulty interpretations. But the book's reputation for unreliability is mostly unfounded. Ultimately, it is Grant's story, not a history of the war. It is not a complete autobiography, however, since most post-1865 events arenot covered. A favorite image (described elsewhere) comes from Grant's post-retirement world travels, when 20,000 English workingmen turned out to march in his honor, honoring him as the general of freedom who vanquished the armies of slavery. He did not save everyone, but along with Lincoln, he saved his country. Enough said.	2002-12-23

Their grammar and syntax might not meet conventional American or British writing standards, but the diverse styles of the authors faithfully reflect Nigerian English. This book reprints several complete novellas, along with excerpts from a number of longer works. The content of these items varies quite a bit, and some works are primarily entertainment. But many also reflect one of their main sources of inspiration---Christian literature disseminated throughout Africa during the colonial era. For many African readers (and writers), this was their first exposure to published literature, and helps explain the heavily didactic, even moralizing tone found throughout many of these texts. Onitsha literature is rarely produced nowadays, but these otherwise hard-to-find examples give unparalleled insight into the interests and concerns of both authors and audiences in late colonial Nigeria. They are also just plain fun, though the idioms will be unfamiliar to American readers. An excellent resource for courses on African literature and popular culture, and African Studies generally, this work cries out for an affordable paperback edition. An added bonus is the direct reproduction of texts and illustrations as they originally appeared and circulated, flaws, smudges and all. This conveys the raw feel of the genre much more effectively than if they had been reset in bland, sanitized new type.	2002-12-23

This is especially true if the editor's introduction merely summarizes the various contributions, rather than developing a more ambitious interpretive or comparative perspective. \\"The African Frontier\\" stands out as a major work because Kopytoff actually constructs a (mostly) convincing theory about state and community formation. He argues that as Africans migrated into thinly settled areas, they sought to reproduce the political and social structures of the societies from which they came, and in so doing created new societies. This emphasis on the tendency to conserve values and institutions sheds light on many important aspects of cultural transformation in African life. It also complements his earlier work on slavery in Africa, which stressed accumulation of wealth through \\"rights-in-people,\\" a key strategy in founding frontier societies. The argument, however, seems more convincing for largely Bantu-speaking areas (east from Nigeria and south from Central African Republic, Uganda and Kenya) than for points west and north. While the book is most helpful concerning state formation and maintenance, it actually contributes more on the subject of the origins of ethnicity than most works explicitly focused on that topic. The individual chapters, all by skilled historians and anthropologists, are generally excellent. Case studies come from West, Central and East Africa. There is nothing quite like it in the literature on Africa, though some fundamental issues addressed here are taken up, in rather different ways, by J. Vansina, \\"Paths in the Rainforests,\\" J. Iliffe, \\"Africans,\\" and C. Ehret et al in \\"The International Journal of African Historical Studies\\" (2001).	2002-12-04

The individual's name is also the name of the company, which explains the incorrect ID by the earlier reviewer.<br /><br />For many years Peter Smith (man & company) has provided reprints of essential scholarly and other works in affordable hardcover editions. The only way to continue this service is to keeping production costs low, occasionally leading to the regrettable results detailed below. The resulting profit margins are too low to interest goliaths of the book world, but scholars and other customers (not to mention libraries with tight budgets) are grateful for what is perhaps as much a public service as a business decision. Why not order their catalog and give 'em some much-needed business? You'll probably spot other worthwhile classics....For instance, my library includes James Malin, \\"Grassland of North America\\" and Wesley Frank Craven, \\"Soil Exhaustion as a Factor in the Agricultural History of Virginia & Maryland,\\" two fine early environmental histories that are virtually impossible to find apart from Peter Smith's editions.<br /><br />I hope this isn't being too hard on the earlier reviewer, but the matter needed clarification. The earlier reviewer's disappointment surely reflects his admiration for EP Thompson's work, which I certainly share---it's arguably the greatest history of the 20th century.	2002-12-02

James emphasized the vanguard role of revolutionary leadership.  Fick acknowledges their role but gives greater weight to ordinary folk, both rank-&-file followers and Haiti's rich history of maroon resistance.  This significantly advances our appreciation of the great achievements of Haiti's founders.  \\"Black Jacobins\\" remains worthwhile, for literary merit as well as insight and its impact on Third World liberation struggles.

Though the subject matter will limit some readers' interest, it is a lucid and well-researched study. Through judicious use of both oral and archival sources, Sikainga demonstrates that whenever slavery is abolished, the freedmen and women have to end up somewhere. That somewhere is usually the working class, whether as tenant farmers, a rural proletariat or part of the urban labor force. Some return home, others stay near their place of enslavement, while still others go to new destinations. This work focuses on the latter group, namely those who migrated to the Sudan's expanding cities and provided the muscle spurring economic growth.    Despite the abolitionist rhetoric of imperialism, most European powers valued socioeconomic stability over prompt emanicipation, which meant that in Africa they seldom abolished the \\"peculiar institution.\\" Rather, they allowed it to die out along with the slaves themselves, thus depriving many courageous and resourceful people of rights and economic opportunities. Sikainga's study is especially valuable in showing how Sudanese freedpeople struggled, with some success, to make new lives for themselves under rapidly changing circumstances. In all societies, the main force in destroying slavery was the slaves' own resistance to their condition.    A paperback edition would be quite useful in teaching courses on slavery, emancipation and labor history. It is a solid work on African transitions from slavery to wage labor. S. Miers and R. Roberts eds, \\"The End of Slavery in Africa\\" gave strong impetus to this subfield 15 years ago; P. Lovejoy and J. Hogendorn, \\"Slow Death for Slavery\\" (on Northern Nigeria) probably sets the current standard. F. Cooper, \\"From Slaves to Squatters\\" (Kenya & Zanzibar) and M. Klein, \\"Slavery and Colonial Rule in French West Africa,\\" are just as good. Many fruitful parallels also can be drawn from Latin American and Asian history; see e.g. M.

But ongoing reflection, as well as teaching and graduate study in history, leads me to offer a more qualified recommendation. Pratt's core idea, that warfare can decisively affect the course of history, is quite sound. But his rather offhand view of war outside the Western world is not supportable. Pratt asserts that truly decisive battles influencing history occurred only in the West; elsewhere, victories changed nothing, and usually victors were simply absorbed by the societies they subjected.<br /><br />This notion reinforces an ethnocentric view that non-Western peoples somehow stand outside history, and that nothing ever really changes for them. Like many specialists in US and European history glancing at the whole world, Pratt proceeds from inattention and/or ignorance in generalizing, even stereotyping, on topics beyond his expertise. Such an assertion overlooks many examples of the decisive character of warfare in Asia and Africa, with or without European participation---the conquests of Genghis Khan and his successors, Japan's conquest of Singapore in 1942, Ethiopia's 1896 triumph over Italy at Adowa, the effects of slaving wars in Africa, etc.<br /><br />Pratt renders persuasive accounts of decisive Western battles in clear, lively prose. But misjudging the miltary experience of the rest of the world weakens his case, which through fuller research could be extended fruitfully to encompass the globe. The whole subject requires further examination; there's plenty of work for numerous scholars to tackle, and this should ultimately show that Pratt's thesis is indeed applicable on a worldwide scale. Ultimately, military historians have moved beyond the Alexandrian/Napoleonic conception of decisive battlefield victory to an appreciation of the total process of war in winning conflicts.<br /><br />For more on the nonhistorical \\"nature\\" of non-Western societies and the processes which integrated them intoa European-dominated global system, read Eric Wolf, \\"Europe and the People Without History\\" and Chinweizu, \\"The West and the Rest of Us.\\" For Asians' and Africans' encounter with Western military technology, strategy and tactics, see Geoffrey Parker, \\"The Military Revolution\\" and Daniel Headrick, \\"The Tools of Empire.\\" M.

Headrick shows that, even though the will to dominate existed for a long time previously, Europe's chance to conquer most of the globe only came in the second half of the 19th century. <br />The technological changes associated with the transition from the First to the Second Industrial Revolution helped create this opportunity. Major innovations such as modern firearms, steamships, railroads, anti-malarial quinine and the telegraph made it much safer for Europeans to live and travel in the tropics, and also easier to attack the indigenous people there. The author gives special attention to developments in India, China and Africa.<br />Headrick's later works lack the sparkle of this groundbreaking text, but are still worthwhile in bringing the story closer to our own time. The more recent titles have rather more coverage of technology transfer---non-Western peoples' use of introduced technologies---in contrast to \\"Tools of Empire's\\" focus on the ways they were used against them.

But Deloria's sensibility is exceptional under any circumstances, and ultimately, what Churchill discusses simply isn't amusing at all---it's tragic and outrageous.	2001-11-19

It includes a general treatment of bad-faith attitudes and policies, and a series of more detailed case studies of exceptionally egregious violations of legal treaties & human rights. It is timeless because of ongoing popular and official ignorance or lack of concern for American Indian rights, economic problems and indigenous culture---witness, for just one chilling example, the continuing imprisonment of Oglala/Anishinaabe activist Leonard Peltier, for murders he did not commit.<br /><br />Jackson was a pioneer activist for Indian rights, and commitment shines through on nearly every page. While it is true that her writing style may seem dated to some contemporary undergraduates, her subject's intrinsic interest holds the attention of any reader with more than a marginal interest in the topic. It is still useful for research purposes, though it is perhaps most valuable for history and/or anthropology courses on changing attitudes & policy toward Indians.<br /><br />In teaching about American Indian history, a main reservation about assigning it is the need to present what Indians themselves have said and/or written about their encounters with Euro-Americans. For a fine variety of views on these issues, see P. Nabokov ed, \\"Native American Testimony,\\" and (among many other sources) memorable works by two premier Indigenous scholar-activists: Ward Churchill, \\"From A Native Son,\\" and Vine Deloria Jr., \\"Custer Died For Your Sins.\\"	2001-11-19

In it Hodgkin, a pioneer of African Studies in the UK, identifies the primary forces shaping politics in late colonial Africa: peasants, urban workers, Christian and syncretic churches, and rising educated intellectuals among others. His optimism over the approach of freedom remains refreshing. It loses half a star in its rating because he failed to anticipate the negative effect of the military and security forces after independence, but then so did most other contemporary observers. Hodgkin, a peer of Basil Davidson, was less prolific but more scholarly than Davidson, and just as readable. For some very acute insights on the early decades of the post-independence era, don't miss the outstanding article by Michael Crowder, \\"Whose Dream Was It Anyway? Twenty Five Years of African Independence,\\" AFRICAN AFFAIRS (1987), 7-24.	2001-11-13
US	41819237	ROKY57VVM92GF	0297816683	831856812	Our War: The Story of the Unsung Heroes of Her Majesty's Foreign Legions	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Three and a Half Stars---Good but Flawed	Aimed at a popular audience, this book both entertains and informs, though perhaps more the former than the latter. Americans interested in learning about Great Britain in World War II tend to undervalue the contributions of the British Empire, which provided a large proportion of the manpower of the \\"British\\" Army and the resources supporting it. \\"Our War\\" improves our understanding of those who struggled and sacrificed to win that epic conflict.  <br />The book has three main merits. It's written in an accessible style, and is in fact engaging reading. Second, its scope is truly inclusive with thorough coverage of nonwhite residents of African, Asian and West Indian colonies as well as the better-known Dominions (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa---though this last country  fits in both categories). This makes it a truly \\"multicultural\\" work, in an unforced way. Lastly, it contains solid chunks of oral and written evidence in the words of veterans, both men and women, letting them speak for themselves.  This latter feature points directly to one of the  book's flaws. In seeking a broad readership, the author eschews direct references to his sources. This weakens the book for research purposes, even for school and college papers. It also has some easily-avoided factual errors, such as on p.329 where the author cannot give the proper colonial-era names for independent Zambia and Malawi. Finally, the numerous maps are well-geared toward the various theaters of war in which Commonwealth-men and -women served, but are less helpful for locating their places of origin. The bibliography is sadly skimpy considering how much material is available.<br />In sum, \\"Our War\\" is comparable to Studs Terkels' American counterpart, \\"'The Good War.'\\" Though Somerville does not match that masterpiece of oral history, his work is better supported with photos, maps, an index and his own text. Narrative flow and powerful personal testimony strongly commend this book as an introduction to its subject, but for fuller detail and deeper analysis readers should also look at, among other works, T. Parsons, \\"The African Rank and File;\\" D. Killingray & R. Rathbone eds., \\"Africa and the Second World War;\\" and P.W. Fay, \\"The Forgotten Army\\" (on the thousands of East Indians who fought with Japan AGAINST Britain). Overall, the recent historiography of the French Empire in World War II is better developed, though now there is also N. Lawler, \\"Soldiers, Airmen, Spies and Whisperers,\\" on wartime Ghana.	2001-11-12

I assigned this work (or the bulk of it at least) for an African American History course in Spring 2001.  It's traditional for students to dislike textbooks designed for classroon use, but this is far from the least popular one.  There are many good surveys of African American history, and while none is completely satisfactory, \\"Upon These Shores\\" has several strong features.  The level of expertise and writing of most chapters is extremely high; some of the premier scholars in the field are represented here, including Peter Wood, Gayraud Wilmore, and Charles V. Hamilton among others.  The chapter bibliographies are very helpful, & the illustrations nicely complement the text.  Ultimately, the deciding factor in assigning this book was the numerous well-chosen excerpts from primary sources embedded in the various chapters.  This helped to acquaint students with the raw materials for doing history, gave direct access to Black voices from the past,and--not least--saved students money since they didn't have to buy a separate collection of sources.    <br />\\"Upon These Shores\\" does have some drawbacks.  It lacks an index, a minor but distinct annoyance.  There is a good chapter on Black feminism, but coverage of African American women in other chapters is rather perfunctory, though the section on the antebellum gender division of labor is very insightful. The result is that Black womens' issues seem regrettably segregated largely into one chapter.  \\"Race relations\\" is mostly defined in black-&-white terms, leaving readers less informed on encounters with other ethnic groups.  Still, this work does not claim to be fully comprehensive, and what's here is quite good indeed.  The course itself covered almost four centuries of history, really too much to do in one semester.  I supplemented \\"Upon These Shores\\" with the following works: Olaudah Equiano, \\"Interesting Narrative;\\" David Walker, \\"Appeal to the Colored People of the World;\\" WEB DuBois, \\"Souls of Black Folk;\\" Anne Moody, \\"Comimg of Age in Mississippi,\\" and shorter writings by Diop, Appiah, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs and Nat Turner.	2001-11-10

US	41819237	R310BZCWZSBI8M	0140093265	517769659	Move Your Shadow: South Africa, Black and White	Books	5	19	22	N	N	Classic Account Of Apartheid South Africa	\\"Move Your Shadow\\" is one of the very best journalistic/popular accounts ever written on South Africa, or any other part of the continent for that matter. I was momentarily shocked to learn that this moving and insightful book is now out of print, until I recalled how ruthlessly the bottom line increasingly determines publishing these days. Lelyveld was a NY Times reporter in South Africa in the early 1980s, thoroughly exploring the most important issues throughout that bitterly divided country. Few works convey so well the routine indignity and daily horror imposed on black South Africans by the white-supremacist regime from 1948 up to the 1994 elections achieving majority rule. Perhaps the best chapter is on the long-distance bus rides required of migrant workers forced to live far from their jobs, by laws mandating residence in impoverished rural \\"homelands\\" (read: dumping grounds for unwanted \\"surplus\\" population).<br /><br />The major omission in this book is the relative lack of coverage of the political resistance to apartheid. Though it gets a 5-star rating to highlight its merits, the missing political dimension means that \\"Move Your Shadow\\" probably deserves 4 1/2 stars. While Lelyveld's insight and compassion make this a superior account, one must turn elsewhere for fuller treatment of the African National Congress, Pan-Africanist Congress and other less formal movements. For a similar journalistic account also encompassing politics, read William Finnegan, \\"Crossing the Line.\\" There's also Tom Lodge, \\"Black Politics in South Africa Since 1945,\\" Stephen Davis, \\"Apartheid's Rebels,\\" and Allister Sparks' exciting if overdramatized \\"Tomorrow Is Another Country.\\" But for the best understanding, one must read what BLACK South Africans have written, including Mamphela Ramphele, \\"A Bed Called Home\\" and Elsa Joubert, \\"Poppie Nongena\\" among many others.	2001-10-22
