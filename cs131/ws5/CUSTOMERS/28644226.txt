He made a name for himself as the country was being formed, especially with his defense of \\"the rules of law\\" against the will of the majority. He was one of the last of the old Federalists. He was a foreign minister to Holland, Portugal, and Prussia, and was Secretary of State under Monroe (where he was the main force in establishing the Monroe Doctrine). He became the sixth President in a controversial election that was decided in the House of Representatives.<br /><br />Parson's short (272 pages) but thorough and well-written biography of Adams is a job well done. She details the accomplishments of his life, but focuses primarily on the man himself. Adams was a stern man (his portrait reminds me of some evil Dickens character, Marley perhaps), and not well-liked by the public. He believed that one should not \\"run\\" for a political office, but should just accept it if offered (imagine that today!). He hated Andrew Jackson and slavery, and fought hard against both. This is an excellent book on an interesting man.	2005-10-14

(Just look in Amazon.com at the number of books on Wyoming's historical sites as compared to other states and you'll see what I mean.) This book, probably a unique undertaking, lists not just highway commission historical signs (other states have published books on that), but EVERY sign that points out some piece of information of historical significance in the state, including, for example, all 30+ plaques one sees at Fort Laramie.<br /><br />The signs/sites are arranged by county; each county has a basic map pinpointing each one by number. The numbering system is the same one used by the Wyoming Recreation Commission in 1967 in their inventory listing. The legend that appears on each sign is given completely, and a very specific location for each sign is likewise provided. Dozens of photographs also appear. Also included is a lengthy opening chapter giving the history of historical marking in Wyoming, a very interesting and informative essay.<br /><br />This is a terrific book and belongs on everyone's shelf who is interested in Wyoming's past.	2005-10-13

The narrator, a drifter still married after six years but no longer living with his wife, encounters Tim (a Vietnam vet with a mean streak and strung out on drugs and booze most of the time) and his girlfriend Sylvia. The narrator becomes obsessed with Sylvia, though she keeps him at a distance out of mixed up loyalty to Tim (though he doesn't love or want her anymore, and she knows it).<br /><br />They concoct a plan to blow up a dam in the West, and the novel traces their actions in fulfilling this plan while contrasting the unrequited love interest the narrator has for Sylvia. Both plans are basically a disaster (Tim blows himself up along with the dam), and that's the irony in the story.<br /><br />Harrison makes these not very appealing characters interesting and worth watching as they proceed down their self-made road of doom. (That's where he failed in his first novel.) The narrative moves along to its conclusion powerfully, and we get swept up in it effortlessly. Harrison has great narrative skill; portraying these particular self-destructive anti-heroes locks the book into a specific time frame, however, that I hope he breaks out of in the future.	2005-10-13

Eberhart writes about roughly 150 towns that were once in existence (most had post offices at one time), all located along the I-25 corridor or east of there on the high plains. He gives a thorough historical account of each place and includes a hand-drawn map of the town's location, making it easy to see where each was exactly (this important element is missing in many ghost town books). In addition, there are many dozens of photographs, some contemporary, some historical, of many of the places described. One of the best books on the subject I've seen. Great for the traveler/explorer as well as for the armchair historian.	2005-10-13

Within that distance the book (a joint effort published by the Garrett County Historical Society) lists and describes about 30 coal towns, most of which are ghosts or barely still in existence. A few places such as Kitzmiller and Bayard are still very much alive and even support post offices yet. The most interesting feature of the book is the inclusion of a large number of photographs and postcards of most of the towns - some of them taken shortly after one or another of the numerous floods that occur along this mountainous stretch of Potomac River. These coal towns seem gritty and fragile places, though stubborn in their existence: many of them could only be entered or left via the railroad. The book is an interesting look at once thriving places of not too long ago that may or may not have seen better days.	2005-10-12

He begins with an in-depth chapter on the influence of the railroads on settlement, and then a short chapter each on homesteading, ethnic communities, pioneer politics, and a couple of poems about places lost to time. Then comes the main part of the book: an alphabetical listing of the towns, from Aldridge to Whitlash. Descriptions of each town and usually a photograph are included (there is usually something still standing in these town worth seeing). The only thing missing are maps - there are none (most placenames are still listed on recent detailed highway maps, however, but not all; DeLorme's Montana topo map book is useful). I had a chance to use this book this summer on a trip to Montana and found it to my liking. Well done!	2005-10-12

Rather long historical accounts of each place are included, along with many illustrations and photos. Although this paperback issue came out in 1981, it is the same as the original edition of 1974; most of the contemporary photos of these ghosts, most taken by Miller, since they are already over 30 years old, might indicate relics that have disappeared since then.<br /><br />One major fault of the book is the absence of maps; only one appears (on the back cover) and it's not very useful. A second fault is that Miller rarely tells you exactly where these towns were located; anyone actually in the field interested in going to these spots would not get much help from Miller's book. Therefore, I have to say the book seems more for those armchair explorers who wouldn't be interested in visiting the ghost towns discussed. The book is interesting in its historical accounts, but not a good guide for the hands-on enthusiast.	2005-10-12

Hearst's father George was a self-made man who made millions in the gold and silver mines of the West. He also had been a Senator from California and had founded the San Francisco Examiner. When George died, he left everything to his wife Phoebe and nothing to his only son William. William was in his late twenties when his father died, and had nothing to show for his age (he was a prep school and Harvard dropout), except for running up expenses when he worked on his father's paper. But he had big ideas and an interesting philosophy to go with them: \\"There is no shame being in debt. Debt, on the contrary, was the magic ingredient to build and buy whatever [one] wanted. A penny saved might be a penny earned, but a penny borrowed was worth even more.\\"<br /><br />With this philosophy driving him he began building his publishing empire, buying newspapers, new equipment, \\"stealing\\" writers and editors from his rivals. His mother was his early source of \\"borrowed\\" income - whatever he wanted she gave him (though she kept careful records).<br /><br />But the publishing business (which, in addition to scores of newspaper around the country, eventually would include ownership of many magazines, which proved even more lucrative) was just a stepping stone to other adventures: politics (he was a US congressman from NYC for a couple of terms and ran for governor and then President, unsuccessfully), the incredible mansions and art collections he spent millions on, and his mistress, the actress Marion Davies, whom he lived with openly for the last three decades of his life though he was still married to his wife Millicent.<br /><br />Hearst was a man of idea, though, and strong opinions, and his newspapers allowed him a platform from which to air them. He was a strong advocate for unions early on and against the trusts; he was against the US getting involved in WW I and hated Wilson; he hated communism and lashed out violently with his pen against Roosevelt's New Deal proposals (especially the NRA), which he viewed as too left-leaning; again when WW II seemed imminent, he believed the US should stay out in Europe (though he felt a strong threat from Japan).<br /><br />Nasaw is an excellent writer and recounts Hearst's life in a compelling and authoritative manner. Perhaps he spends a bit too much time on Hearst's life with Marion - it takes on a sordid quality, especially when combined with all the space devoted to the mansions, the parties in them, and the seemingly maniacal need to collect artifacts, regardless of price. But he makes it plain that Hearst was more than that, and that he influenced public opinion and was a world shaker greater than most newspaper editors even dare to dream. A fascinating book.

Nye explores how electricity changed the home (it was now cleaner and safer than gas), the factory, and transportation (it made the subway and inter-urban trolley-car systems possible). Americans embraced this new source of energy quickly and convincingly. The mantra, however, that electric appliances would free the housewife was not true: men did not take to the appliances as readily and (surprise!) women suddenly were doing chores (vacuuming) that men used to do (beat the rugs). There is a lot of detail in the book, but not much that is new or not obvious. For that reason it was somewhat dull.	2005-10-11

In one of his theories he contends that early American literature was negatively affected by the duality of idealism and materialism. He wrote three biographies of major writers to illustrate this theory, one on Henry James, who, Brooks believed, fled to Europe rather than face the problem; another on Mark Twain, his most controversial book, in which he attempted to show how Twain was a failure, unable to fulfill his potential because of his \\"crippling\\" Calvinistic background; and the third on Emerson, whom he thought a success.<br /><br />All this was prelude, however, to his major work, a multi-volume series of critical books, spanning the time from Washington Irving up to about 1915. Nelson relates that Brooks, before starting, had decided to read EVERYTHING written in the 19th Century, and one gets the feeling from these works is of a man filled with authority and confidence in his judgments. Nelson's biography covers the important points in Brooks's life, though it's somewhat shallow and doesn't delve much beneath the surface. His writing style is pedestrian. Brooks, unfortunately, has fallen from favor and has pretty much disappeared from the literary scene, even in the historical sense. Hopefully his work will not be totally forgotten.	2005-10-11

Hedren has chosen 54 specific historical sites relating to the Great Sioux War and arranged them chronologically, with site 1 being the Grattan Battlefield in Wyoming (commemorating an 1854 incident which helped set the stage for later events) and site 54 being Sitting Bull's grave in South Dakota (he died in 1890). In addition to these 54 \\"official\\" sites, Hedren identifies and directs readers to many other related locations nearby.<br /><br />Each site gets a number (which is also pin-pointed on a map), a brief description of the its significance, and directions to it (also whether it's on private property or not); then follows a longer historical account of the site's role in the War and a number of photographs indicating what a visitor to the site would see. It's a magnificent tool for anyone touring the area (most sites are in Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska), but it's just as valuable (and exciting) for anyone interested in the Sioux War who can't leave his livingroom. A great book. Highly recommended.	2005-10-10

Smith seems determined to write a sensational work of popular history; unfortunately, the subject he picked doesn't lend itself to his purpose. The attempt of \\"agent\\" George Mathews to stir up the residents of Spanish Florida to declare their independence and then cede their lands to the United States was not only a minor and, finally, futile event, but subsequent developments made the whole thing pointless. By 1812, war with Britain seemed eminent and the US was worried that Britain would try to seize West Florida; the government ordered forces into the area although diplomatically it had to deny this to the Spanish authorities. This duplicity rankles Smith. So much of what was going on was done covertly and behind the scenes, with apparently so little at stake, that it's hard to find much interest in Smith's account. Smith's sensational intentions are made clear when he opens the book with a chapter on James and Dolley Madison's marriage and their \\"inability\\" to have children. There are also no footnotes, odd for a \\"serious\\" historical work.<br /><br />One thing Smith declares that I can't agree with is his belief that the War of 1812 was lost by the Americans. There were two major causes of that war: America's abhorrance of her sailors being suppressed by English men-of-war and England's fear that America wanted to conquer Canada. It's true that when hostilities ended, neither of those concerns entered into the peace treaty signed by both nations, but never again were American sailors suppressed nor Canada threatened. In addition, America was once and for all an independent nation no longer dependent on others, especially England, for its economic survival. Sounds like a victory to me - for both sides.	2005-10-09

He writes of Larkin in this biography with respect and candor, and not as a hero-worshiper (or disparager). Larkin's life, because of his reclusive nature, was not an open book, and he had a dark side, which contrasts greatly with the kind of lyrical, often witty (though at times bitter) poetry he produced.<br /><br />Larkin wrote poetry from an early age, though his first desire was to be a novelist. In fact he wrote two novels, neither of which made much of a hit, and he could write no others. He worked every day as a librarian at Brynmor Jones Library in Hull. He loved traditional jazz and wrote frequently about it. He never married, but had two mistresses; one he mistreated badly. He could be funny and also mean-spirited. There were many parts to the man, some at odds with others. Motion does a good job fleshing these sides out and dealing with them without passing judgment. It's a fair and balanced, well-written biography. Recommended.	2005-10-09

Ceram includes chapters on Pompeii, the discovery of Troy, the pyramids and Valley of the Kings in Egypt, deciphering the cuneiform script, ancient Babylon and Ur, and New World discoveries in Mexico and Peru, among other topics. The text is succinct (it is a pictorial history), but clear and focused. Ceram is also willing to venture an opinion here and there; for example, he believes Schliemann's methods at Troy were not as bad as most make them out to be and archaeologists need to cut him a break. The pictures and photographs (310 of them) complement the text beautifully. For someone new to the field or wanting a brief outline of the major events (Ceram even includes a thorough chronological table listing important archaeological matters), this is an excellent source.	2005-10-08

To quote Foner: \\"Twain points out that the material welfare and cultural achievements of civilization had derived entirely from the suppressed masses, and only in the masses of common men lay the seeds of a better social order.\\" \\"[Twain] firmly believed that the only power in modern society capable of eradicating the evils of capitalism was organized labor.\\" Whether either of these quotes is actually true is difficult to prove, though Foner believes them fully.<br /><br />A humorist is a tough nut to crack: when is he telling what he truly believes and when is he just kidding? I think all humorists operate from the premise that they can be the most outrageous/outspoken members of society because they always have the \\"I was just kidding\\" curtain to pull down when they are asked to explain or when the \\"injured\\" push back. I think Twain played this game expertly.<br /><br />Twain had the power (and defenses) to call into question many of the ills infecting the world he lived in, from the excesses of monopolistic capitalism to imperialism to social injustices. I also believe that he trusted his criticisms were just and correct. But it doesn't make him a socialist (his good friend William Dean Howells had much stronger socialistic leanings, as even Foner admits). I think hypocrisy was Twain's biggest target, a failing that afflicts people of all political, economic, and religious persuasions. Foner goes too far in trying to depict Twain as a true radical ready to take to the streets; not even Mark Twain could want that and be as wonderfully funny as he was at the same time.	2005-10-07

WW II had taken its toll on team rosters, leaving only \\"the lame, the too old, the too young, and the too slow\\" behind to play the National Pastime. Mead has researched thoroughly the time period and conducted interviews with many of the players. The interviews are, as usual in books like this, the best parts of the book. There are even a few chapters dealing with some of the big name pros (DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Hank Greenberg) who were in the service and what life was like for them.<br /><br />Major league baseball sold millions of dollars in war bonds and helped maintain a certain amount of normalcy during tough times. Mead's fondest memory is of the 1944 Browns, usually in the cellar of the American League, who that year won the Pennant and played their cross-town rivals in the World Series. (They lost.) Mead, to his credit, stays critical and honest in his reportage and doesn't stoop to nostalgia. An interesting account, and a book that baseball enthusiasts with an eye on the game's past should enjoy.	2005-10-06

It deals with Roosevelt's time spent as president, from McKinley's death to 1910, when Taft took over. (One of TR's biggest regrets must have been his decision not to run for another term in 1908, passing the reins on to Taft, whom he had hand-picked as a replacement, only to be sorely disappointed in his choice.)<br /><br />Although this volume is as thorough and well written as the first, it's not quite as compelling as the earlier book (THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT, 1979) mainly because Roosevelt himself is not as compelling. TR accomplished a lot as president - building the Panama Canal, developing the navy into a world power, freeing Cuba, brokering peace between Japan and Russia, and establishing a number of national parks and monuments - but many of those achievements must be told in diplomatic terms, which is often not very exciting. Still, Morris has great respect for his subject and writes in a style that engages the reader from beginning to end. A great biography continues.	2005-10-05

His wit, as revealed in the DICTIONARY is clever, but at times sophomoric. Influenced by Poe, many of his stories deal with the supernatural and are laced with horror. He disappeared in Mexico in 1913 and was never seen again. Speculation, from suicide to fighting for Pancho Villa, has been rampant ever since. Morris does a good job relating the events of Bierce's strange life, who must have been a very difficult man to know.	2005-10-05

He read at least one book a day (he could, and would, recite reams of German poetry in the original from memory); he wrote thousands of letters and scores of books (his book on the War of 1812 is still considered definitive). After exhausting himself as Governor by traveling all over New York state, he \\"rested\\" at Sagamore Hill on Long Island for a month by writing a book on Cromwell. Nobody could match his physical energy either. I imagine, as many who dined with him claimed afterward, he could be totally overbearing as a person (he loved to talk and others rarely got a word in edgewise), but he had many admirerers.<br /><br />Morris writes wonderfully, in the old grand historical narrative style. He respects his man and is not blinded by an assumed greatness for his subject. This is the first volume in a projected three-volume biography, and I look forward to reading those subsequent volumes. Highly recommended.	2005-10-05

In a terrific opening chapter, Fox discusses what he considers to be the defining moment for each sport, and for each it ends up being the same concept: putting the ball in the air (the \\"invention\\" of the jump shot in basketball by Kenny Sailors, the utilization of the forward pass by Benny Friedman, and the sudden blossoming of the home run with Babe Ruth).<br /><br />Each team is then given a separate chapter in which Fox relates its early developments; Fox is particularly interested in the formative years of each sport: baseball prior to 1900, football when it was more a slugfest and teams just slammed into one another, and basketball when it actually was played inside a cage (thus the term \\"cagers\\" for basketball players). Finally, there's a chapter each on the \\"national\\" team for each sport: the Yankees, the Packers, and the Celtics.<br /><br />Fox has done his reasearch well, but the book is more than just another history book. Humorous anecdotes abound, and Fox is forthright about how drink, drugs, and sex ruined many a career. You won't find your typical hero worship here either (except for maybe Ruth, Friedman, and Bill Russell), just a lot of interesting information about the three most popular pro sports in America. Highly recommended.	2005-10-04

THE book on the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896-99. Berton tells the story in chronological order, beginning with the pre-Gold Rush period when individual prospectors roamed the Yukon River territory looking for El Dorado. A million dollars worth of gold was hauled out of Circle City, an early camp, in 1896; a year later they would do the same in a matter of weeks in Dawson City, a few hundred miles up the Yukon from Circle City. Of course, after the big strike was made on Rabbit Creek in August 1896, Circle City was emptied of its population by the spring. Gold camp communities that had lived and thrived under a well-understood frontier code lost their cohesiveness; the thousands of outsiders rushing into the Klondike could never abide by such a code.<br /><br />Berton relates the human interest stories, too. The infamous Soapy Smith, the dictator of Skagway, is here, as are the thousands of crazies who came north to the Arctic Circle underclothed, unprepared, unprovisioned, full of the gold fever. Things got so bad by the winter of '97 that the government had to appropriate $200,000 for those in the Yukon to prevent mass starvation. And still they came, heading up the Chilkoot Pass like ants. It was called a stampede, but progress was so slow it seemed anything but. Only the outbreak of the Spanish-American War put an end to it, along with the discovery of gold in Nome.<br /><br />It's an exciting story, the last gold rush anyone will ever see. Factual, without unnecessary hype, Berton's book is an excellent account of this period in history. Highly recommended.	2005-09-28

From its formative years in the early 1920's, to the full blossoming of its style in the  1930's, to its reigning years around WW II, to its ultimate decline in the 1950's (a victim of many forces, including television and the rise of rock 'n' roll), Walker relates the impact of this popular phenomenon on the music world and the culture in general. He also devotes chapters to the recording industry, gigs, movies and other segments of the business. Again the emphasis is on general trends rather than on the specific doings of particular bands. The book opens with the question, \\"Whatever happened to the big dance band business?\\" When you get to the end of the book, you should have a very adequate answer.	2005-09-26

In this book he looks at the United States from the time war was declared in Europe in 1914 up until the time the US got involved in the fighting herself. He doesn't much like what he sees.<br /><br />Although America declared neutrality at the beginning of hostilities in Europe, she was actually supporting the side of the Entente (England, France, Italy) from the start. Thus, while most of the country didn't want America in the war and President Wilson had promised to keep the country out of it, because the country had from the beginning \\"chosen one side over the other,\\" she was inextricably drawn in. Subsequent events - submarine warfare, the sinking of the Lusitania, the Mexican fiasco, the principles of \\"watchful waiting\\" and \\"preparedness for peace\\" - only fanned the already well-burning fire. Millis is particularly opposed to the war-mongers such as Theodore Roosevelt, whom he characterizes as extremely irresponsible.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to get a thorough account of what America was experiencing with regard to the Great War up to 1917 will do well with this book. Just be warned that Millis takes a very anti-war stand, and his astonishment at the hypocrisy of the country's actions as it was led into the horrendous conflict, is head-shakingly obvious.	2005-09-26

Basically, three types of northern generals oversaw the government's role: those in favor of the views of the Radical Republicans (Sheridan, Mower, Reynolds), those opposed to those views (Hancock, Rousseau, and Augur - all Democrats), and those somewhere between the two (Emory and Buchanan). Of course, Southerners hated the likes of Sheridan and Mower (Sheridan was perhaps the most hated man in the state after Benjamin Butler). But Dawson makes it clear that some sort of northern control of governmental affairs in the state, indeed the whole South, was necessary.<br /><br />The book examines the role of these agents, how they acted, and where they succeeded and failed. It was a tremendously difficult task, given the South's antipathy toward the freed blacks, the Republicans, and the army that was occupying them. There was general distaste to occupation all around; even the soldiers were uncomfortable with it, a view going back to the Mexican War when soldiers occupied parts of Mexico, something they disdained then. This was something new in America. But the Republicans had an agenda they wanted accomplished, including guarantees for the freedmen, an agenda the army found difficult to attain. Dawson writes well of these hard times. All of it ended in failure, of course, with the election of Hayes as President and subsequent troop withdrawal (part of the \\"deal\\" that got Hayes the electoral votes he needed to win), leaving only the final curtain of Jim Crow to descend on the Southern stage.	2005-09-26

It is not just an entertaining diversion for fans of the show or musical theatre in general, but a serious study and commentary of Edna Ferber's book (upon which the show is based), the original 1927 Broadway production, the first 1929 Hollywood movie version, the 1936 Universal movie version, and the 1951 MGM version. Kreuger is not afraid to be critical (he believes the 1936 movie is the best Hollywood rendition because it follows the original play the closest, while the 1951 movie is the worst because of \\"its largely inappropriate cast, its musical mutilation, its humorless script, and its empty Technicolored fripperies\\"). Complete cast listings, a list of regional productions, and a selected discography are included, along with scores of photographs. A very handsome book about a supreme example of the American Musical, a delight for the eye as well as the mind.	2005-09-25
US	28644226	R1FK9DYNQFP2JP	B0000C7GF8	698945189	Family	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The Frazier family	I think it's Frazier's style that is the most attractive thing about this book. He writes in simple declarative sentences with little embellishment - exactly the way someone would tell you a story orally. No histrionics, no deep reflections - just straight facts, boom, boom. It works magnificently here.<br /><br />He tells a history of his family (it's not really a memoir, at least not until the end, which is the weakest part), going back to his ancestors who first came to America. The best part I think is the first half; Frazier is very interested in the Civil War and spends a lot of time tracing relatives as they fought with the 55th Ohio Volunteer Infantry and the 11th Corps. (He goes way off on a tangent writing about Stonewall Jackson; it's interesting but probably could have been edited out.)<br /><br />Commendable is his willingness to reveal some not very pleasant things about his relatives at times: prejudices, job failings, embarrassments - things that other writers would have kept secret. Unfortunately, as his family history becomes more contemporary he comes across as more self-serving: I felt suddenly that he was writing more for himself than for his audience. An excellent first half, though - and that style is terrific.	2005-09-25

It's a masterpiece. Clark presents a thorough, erudite, and accessible account of Einstein's life and work. He begins by relating Einstein's early struggles and his years at the Swiss Patent Office, where he read and analyzed technical reports. Then came the great relativity theory and the subsequent success and reknown. The flight from Nazi Germany to Princeton, the building of the atomic bomb during WW II (he regretted this association the most in his life), and the myths that developed around his life with the public (he hated the public adulation; when he died he didn't want his house on Mercer Street in Princeton to become a shrine) also get their fair and judicious treatment. Einstein was a great scientist who had developed some of the most complicated theories in physics, and Clark is excellent in trying to explain them for the general reader. But he is best when capturing Einstein the man. Clark writes with the confidence of a master, even majestically. It's a long book and not a fast read, but the time spent with Clark and his magnificent subject is time very well spent. One even wishes for more at the end. A brilliant work.	2005-09-24

Bitter feelings prevail when the town learns that the landholder, who is being represented by Major Trescot at the trial, wants to evict some of the tenants on his property. The tenants are represented by the lawyer Greyhurst, who has an evil temper: when Trescot wins at the trial, Greyhurst shoots and kills him. Constance, Trescot's wife, who was portrayed as a most sympathetic and kind character, is transformed by her husband's death. She spends the rest of her life getting revenge on Greyhurst, shadowing him, hounding him, until he commits suicide. Her revenge is relentless, but it's an empty victory: at the end, and with no fanfare, she is totally alone. Perhaps her powers against Greyhurst are a bit too strong to be totally believable, but it doesn't take anything away from the novel's strength. The best part of the book is the trial; Mitchell makes it extremely dramatic. One of Mitchell's best books. Someone should get this novel and ROLAND BLAKE back into print again.	2005-09-23

Perhaps the secret is not so awful (a father's bankruptcy and suicide), especially to modern sensibilities, to cause such power over another and such misery, but it does. Octopia, as Mitchell develops her, is one of the most beastly characters in American literature, especially the way she uses her semi-invaldism as a weapon to gain sympathy. I found this novel so captivating it was hard to put down. The action is crisp, as is the dialogue. An excellent book in every way.	2005-09-23

The major spice being fought over was nutmeg, which at the time was thought to be the only remedy for the plague, which just happened to be ravishing London at the time. Nutmeg grew only on the island of Run, which was half-way around the world, not so easy to reach in 1600. The cruelties lavished by both countries (especially the Dutch at Amboyna, where they accused some English traders of conspiracy and tortured them for a week before killing them) were horrendous.<br /><br />Although the English were initially victorious, the Dutch soon out-fought them and controlled all the Spice Islands. But the Dutch mismanaged the islands, especially Run, and by the late 1700's the islands were not that important anymore. It's a fascinating story and Milton tells it well - a most informative and intriguing book.	2005-09-23

Before writing, however, he spent many years wandering across the country working menial jobs from diswasher to ranch hand, soaking up experinces he could use later in his work. This novel, his last (published a year after his death at age 52), is somewhat different in that the setting is Mexico (where Motley had lived since 1951), though the theme of poverty is present, along with the idea of the rich (in this case the tourist trade) corrupting the poor.

When Mary finds her husband she sees he has a number of Indian wives, so she \\"quits\\" him.<br /><br />All the McMurtry touches are here - the humorous, understated dialogue; the accidents (Mary's father dies right at the beginning of the journey); the finger of fate everywhere; the appearance of some famous historical people. But the book feels tired and rushed. He writes as if he were trapped in the Western setting created by his great successes of the past and can't get out. A disappointing work.	2005-09-20

This time it's the West of 1832, and an eccentric family from Europe is venturing up the Missouri River and encounters all kinds of adventures. Thus it's yet another version of LONESOME DOVE, at least in form, but it's much weaker - McMurtry is almost parodying himself. Halfway through the Lonesome Dove series of novels, McMurtry said he no longer cared about the characters. From his subsequent writing, especially when concerned with the Old West, it's obvious his statement contains a great deal of truth. If so, why does he continue to write novels like this? This book is a big comedown for McMurtry.	2005-09-20

He's tired of the rat race that seems to permeate his life, so he leaves his wife and home and takes up residence in a nearby cabin. He gives up driving and walks (then bicycles) everywhere, sometimes over great distances. He builds a huge garden in which he grows just about every foodstuff imaginable, cares for it religiously 10 hours a day, and gives all the food away to the poor who come for it. He begins going to a psychiatrist in Wichita Falls who tells him to read all of Proust, which he struggles through. (Proust is McMurtry's favorite writer.) Finally, he flies off alone to Egypt.<br /><br />This novel is a major achievement for McMurtry, a big step up from TEXASVILLE in the trilogy. He is much more focused on his characters, and his insights are more penetrating. Some of the things he has Duane do in his search for redemption and meaning in life are outlandish (as only McMurtry could be), but he pulls them off convincingly (even when we begin to doubt the believability of things). Top-drawer McMurtry and a pleasure to read.	2005-09-19

(Many of the scenes in his A FAREWELL TO ARMS are based on these experiences.) This volume contains her diary and letters she wrote to him at the time (his letters to her are lost), as well as a few other pieces. One significant revelation is that it seems their relationship was platonic: when Agnes broke it off she said she felt more like \\"a mother than a sweetheart\\" (she was also 7 years older than he was). The letters reveal interesting insights into who Hemingway was at a time before the macho aura completely took over his personality. A so-so movie was based on this book.	2005-09-19

He writes little or nothing about his persoanl life (except his love for reading and his quadruple bipass surgery). He expresses often a love for Proust and Virginia Woolf, but never tells why. It's a somewhat interesting book (for those who care about McMurtry as a writer), but it doesn't go very far beneath the surface.	2005-09-19

All were pre-modern works relecting the values and style of an earlier age. But with this novel Deland turned her hand to modern (or what was thought by some to be modern) themes and characters - and it's a disaster. It's about a young woman, Frederica, who wants out with the old (Victorianism) and in with the new (women's suffrage, women in business, etc.). But she comes across as a dull and whining brat, and the scenes where her older relatives tell how uncivilized everyone has become as compared to the \\"good old days\\" are tiresome. Frederica may represent the wave of women's rights and concerns of the times, but Deland does not portray any of them realistically or believably.

Manfred's style, as in all his books, is crude and lowbrow on purpose, and will not be to everyone's taste (I'm not very fond of it myself). The novel is a realistc portrait of rural America during the 1930's; I thought it a better work than Manfred's THE GOLDEN BOWL.	2005-09-17

Carl Sandburg is best remembered for his poetry and his multi-volume biography of Abraham Lincoln. In addition, he also wrote an excellent memoir about his childhood years and this 1,000 page novel (among other things). The theme of the book is America, mainly the Pilgrims, the Revolutionary War, and the Civil War. It's a sprawling book as it deals with each period, so sprawling that the characters, and there are many of them, never really come to life. Sandburg writes well, and much of the novel takes on a poetic feel. But the novel seems more about the American Dream than the flesh-and-blood people who actually dream (and live) it.	2005-09-16

The accounts are interesting: we get Darwin, of course, but also Sir Joseph Hooker in the Himalayas, Alfred Wallace in the Amazon and on the Malayan Archipelago, Henry Bates also in the Amazon, Richard Spruce in the Amazon and the Andes, Richard Lander and Heinrich Barth in Africa,  Mary Kingsley in Africa, and Marianne North in Borneo. All were fearless, resourceful, and dedicated scientists/collectors of plant and animal species from the areas they explored. Thousands of new species of flora and fauna were first identified by these intrepid people. Raby covers a lot of ground by telling about each of these scientists (and others as well) succinctly and directly. He also attempts to explain the times in which these scientists worked as people tried to come to grips with Darwin's implications. A fascinating and important book.	2005-09-16

Children are not usually portrayed very well by McMurtry, and Eddie is no exception: he acts and talks like an old man, which becomes unbelievable and very annoying after a while.

Worst of all, they have to walk across the Jornado del Muerto, an immense desert region, which they just barely survive. It contains all the things that made LONESOME DOVE great, except for the variety of outlandish characters that peopled that novel. If you like McMurtry's writing style, his fascination with the grotesque, his depiction of people as just blundering along at times, his lack of shyness in describing violent events - and all of it swathed in a Twainian understated humor - you should enjoy this book very much.

Heroes, cowards, and fools all appeared during those two days before the fierce winds that made containment difficult abated. Ed Pulaski saved a large crew from destruction by his actions. But Baudette and Spooner, both in Minnesota, were destroyed in only 20 minutes.<br /><br />The country didn't really have a forest fire plan, in most cases just allowing fires to burn themselves out. But these fires, which destroyed so much property, forced officials to make big changes, among them the creation of the Forest Service.<br /><br />A debate raged over whether fires should be fought head-on or by employing light burning to prevent devastating fires from erupting. (Pyne is weakest in dealing with these debates and doesn't make the issues or outcome clear.) In some ways the debate still continues, especially now that so many homes and communities have been built on forest lands.<br /><br />A pretty interesting book, though Pyne's writing style is not very compelling.	2005-09-15

Duane Moore has made big bucks in the oil fields, but he is also in major debt. The novel chronicles Thalia, Texas, the same setting as the earlier novel, during the early-mid 1980's. It must have been crazy times based on the outrageous behavior of most of these characters (even for McMurtry, who revels in over-the-top characters). McMurtry likes to people his novels liberally and personalize each character immediately by (1) giving them an unusual name and (2) making them quirky in some way personality-wise. That is certainly true here, but there are just too many people doing too many weird things - it begins to not make too much sense after a while. The book lacks focus and a meaningful central core around which to derive a connection with the characters. A miss for McMurtry.	2005-09-15

Suddenly all kinds of secrets about Marion begin to emerge (one is that she is actually much older than believed), and the reason she gives for keeping them hidden so long was to \\"protect\\" the Major.

But because of OPEC and high oil prices in the early 1970's, clean burning coal became a feasible option in our energy policies. In the Powder River Basin lies a huge area of coal, but few people live close enough to it to work it. So the town of Wright was created.<br /><br />The book studies the problems of building a new town from scratch - the cost of housing, services, etc. Trailer parks, which do not foster permanence, were not to be the way for Wright. It is a well-established town now, but its existence depends on a single product, a fickle one at that. If and how long Wright exists is for the future to decide.

This book does both in spades. It details the four-year excavation project (much of it supported by the National Geographic Society) of part of the Carter's Grove plantation, near Jamestown, Virginia, in the hopes of finding evidence of earlier inhabitation and clues to the 1622 Indian \\"massacre\\" that occured there. Before it was all over, a fort, a lost town (Wolstenholme Towne), and the skeletal remains of at least three victims of the Indian attack were unearthed. Hume tells of the archealogical excavation in great detail, yet avaoids the ho-hum pitfalls such detailed scientific explanations might produce by utilizing a very approachable style, filled with humor and good cheer, especially when the weather got bad. Even archeologists are human after all, and false leads, wild goose chases, and seemingly endless unanswerable questions plague them as much as the rest of us; Hume's dealing with that in very human terms we all can appreciate makes this book a welcomed exception to the general rule. An excellent book.<br /><br />One small quibble: in discussing the wooden palisade that surrounded the fort, Hume refers to a \\"Fort Laramie-style wall of pointed tree trunks.\\" It's true that many American forts in the West had that kind of protective wall around them, but Fort Laramie never did; it had no wall around it at all.	2005-09-13

The book is centered around the murder of former Idaho governor Frank Steunenberg in 1905, but Lukas ripples out from this center so far that it begins to seem a minor detail. In formulating the book he began by researching the mining wars of the West around the turn of the 20th century (Boise, Cripple Creek) and the rise of the labor and concurrent Socialist movements in America.<br /><br />But that wasn't enough. Lukas decided that in order to understand his central event fully, virtually the entire social, political, legal, and cultural fabric of the country at that time needed to be laid out. Thus the book becomes a very large and weighty tome in which, along with the main events of the Steunenberg murder and trial, the Pinkertons, newspaper reporting, Pullman cars, even the Elks and Odd Fellows all receive detailed coverage. Walter Johnson, the great Washington Senators pitcher, gets 14 pages for no other reason than he was playing minor league ball in Idaho at the time and the lawyers and reporters covering the trial of Steunenberg's alleged killers liked to go to the games. When such a minor thing receives such major focus it becomes difficult to distinguish it from the really major events, and it soon becomes just a catalog of events.<br /><br />Lukas is an excellent writer and much of what he writes about is interesting, but the book almost becomes purposeless in its willingness to spread over such a large field. Here's where the skills of a good editor would have been handy. Unless, of course, Lukas refused such tampering of his work, and his reputation after winning the Pulitzer for his earlier COMMON GROUND (about the busing of school children in Boston in the 1970s) allowed him the privelege of final say. Who knows?<br /><br />But the book is actually a handful of books rolled up into one, to the detriment of the one book (the whole is less than the sum of its parts). Although awesome in scope, it's finally disappointing because that scope was not harnessed in a useful way.not harnessed in a useful way.	2005-09-13

This book attempts to answer that question with a number of possibilities. For me the clearest answer had to do with the separation of Salem Village and Salem Town and how they perceived each other: Town was bigger and had the political clout to control the Village; Village wanted independence, which meant the right to elect its own leaders and, even more important, be independent in church matters. What was truly unusual about this arrangement for Salem was that the Village was caught in the middle between Town's dominence and the taste of independence it was allowed to savor - but never really have. This bred contempt and eventually the only means they felt available to force resolution, which went beyond the political and ecclesiastical realm in which they had no power anyway: witchcraft. The authors lean toward the psychology of guilt and accusation in proposing answers, which might be all well and good, but the answers are more basic and obvious than that, I think. A well written book, admirable for the extent to which original sources are utilized.	2005-09-09

Barry relates the spread and horror of this epidemic dramatically and compellingly, but the book is not without its faults.<br /><br />First of all, Barry begins the book by giving a thumbnail sketch(although taking up 87 pages) of medical research up to the Twentieth Century. It's all very interesting, especially the sorry state of America's universities up to the end of the 19th Century. But is it necessary?<br /><br />Barry also writes in a style that sounds only one step from being a Hollywood script, with many sections ending in teasers leading into the next section (\\"And there was something else, something still worse.\\") This technique is repeated so frequently that it becomes annoying. He employs other devices as well that push his text from the dramatic into the melodramatic realm. These are defects that were absent from Barry's excellent book on the Mississippi River floods of 1927, RISING TIDE.<br /><br />The book will probably be compared to an earlier book, also a popular history, on the subject, Gina Kolata's FLU (1999). The big difference between the two is on emphasis: Barry is mainly interested in the spread and effect of the flu on society; Kolata focused more on the search for the virus that caused the disease after the epidemic was over. So they are quite different.<br /><br />THE GREAT INFLUENZA is not a bad book, especially in terms of the information it tells about the epidemic. It falls down only with regard to the stylistic choices Barry decided to use as a way to make the horrific even more so.	2005-09-09

She also says nothing about the other guides, so the title of the book is somewhat misleading: there is a lot more about the guides left out than discussed. She writes in a pedestrian, academic style, too, which is not appealing. I expected more from this book and was generally disappointed.	2005-09-09

They include Henry James, Stephen Crane, W.H. Hudson, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Hardy, H.G. Wells, John Galsworthy, D.H. Lawrence, Ivan Turgenev, Theodore Dreiser, and Algernon Charles Swinburne. Each essay mainly relates Ford's personal take on each man rather than a discussion of each man's work. He was impressed with the talent of all these writers, some more than others. He thought Crane was the first American writer because he was \\"the first to be passionately interested in the life that surrounded him - and the life that surrounded him was that of America.\\" (What about Mark Twain?) He didn't go along with Wells's belief in machines and economics; he believed to \\"have a living civilization we must have civilized hearts.\\" When Ford first met Dreiser he says humorously that \\" when Mr. Dreiser said hurriedly that he had read all my books and liked them very much and I had replied just as hurriedly that I had read all his and liked them very much too, I was not lying as much as he was.\\" He disliked Lawrence the most, man and books. Above all he felt that Turgenev was the ultimate master, the best writer and craftsman of all these writers and of all writers. One wonders at times exactly what audience Ford had in mind for these essays (despite himself: Ford always seems to have himself in mind) because they don't speak to the reader directly, though in spots they can be very interesting. By the end, though, I felt I wanted more than Ford delivered.	2005-09-09

Then I did something I'd never done before and haven't done again since with a book I've read: I re-read it immediately. It still floored me. I then predicted the book would win the Pulitzer Prize, that there couldn't possibly be anything published in fiction that could out perform it - and it did. (It's the only time I ever predicted anything that came true.) The novel, a big sprawling epic about a cattle drive from Texas to Montana, is filled with fascinating and terrifying incidents, strange and wonderful characters, and all the humor and pathos one could ever want. There is not a single boring page in the whole 900+ page opus, and it's amazing how often one goes from tears to laughter and back again on a single page, wrenched by McMurtry's portrayals. A very great book; it's without a doubt my favorite of all time - a desert island book for me. It shows McMurtry at his most Dickensian: bigger than life. The TV miniseries based on the book adhered to it very closely, and that's why that too was a masterpiece. Magnificent in every way.	2005-09-07

Written in 1970 and revised in 1985, this was not written as a comedy (as many of Lodge's other novels are), but it is still very funny in spots.

Turner believed that, up to 1890, the ever-present frontier, that place always to the west that offered free lands to citizens willing and able to work it, created a totally unique citizen - the American - individualistic, independent, and nationalistic. Critics tend to be rankled by Turner's insistence that his theory was all inclusive; for example, it excluded or downplayed European influences in the making of America's character. Much of Turner's theory does seem to explain a lot about this country, but not all. This book presents alternative arguments, pro and con, by important historians (George Wilson Pierson, Walter Prescott Webb, Ray Billington, Louis M. Hacker, among others), and is a good introduction to Turner's ideas and his critics.	2005-09-03

Hayes was elected President over Samuel Tilden, even though Tilden had more popular and (it seemed likely) more electoral votes as well, is usually explained rather simply (or simplistically): in exchange for removing Federal troops that still oversaw government rule in Louisiana and South Carolina, the South would give its electoral votes to Hayes and cease threatening a new civil war. The biggest loser, of course, would be the freed blacks, who would have no federal protection at all anymore. Woodward contends there was a lot more to the Compromise than just this, and that's what his book explores. Apparently in addition to the troops being removed, the South would get a few cabinet posts, promises of federal appropriations for internal improvements, and passage of the Texas Pacific Railroad Bill, which guaranteed a southern route for a trans-continental railroad at government expense. The deal was struck, Hayes was elected, the troops left, Reconstruction was officially ended, the Texas-Pacific was completed in 1892. Meanwhile, the South became a one-party (Democrat) section and segregation ruled the land. For the next couple of generations the fate of the South was sealed.	2005-09-03

As in most of McMurtry's fiction, it's the woman who comes across as the one best in knowing exactly what she wants and in control of the situation. McMurtry is funny, poignant, and above all, interesting and entertaining in these pages.	2005-09-02

That's the usual judgment, but it's hard to say because nothing of real consequence occurred during Harding's two years in office that would have tested his mettle: calling the Washington Conference in 1921 to limit naval armaments, perhaps his biggest (positive) accomplishment, doesn't exactly go down in history as memorable. His reputation, though, much of it hidden from the public until long after his death, is horrendous. He would rather play poker than do anything else, and he revelled in his own pomposity. He fathered a child out of wedlock as a Senator and had other affairs as well. His presidency was one of the most corrupt in history: many of his cabinet cronies were involved in one scandal after another, the biggest being the Teapot Dome affair, which was all about selling off the government's oil reserve to the highest bidders behind everyone's back. Not much to admire, and Russell pulls no punches in expressing his disdain for his subject. The book is solidly written, though it is overly long, especially where Russell goes into Harding's death (food poisoning?) in California. One of the better Presidential biographies out there, however. Recommended.	2005-09-01

McCullough is very warm to his subject, defending him ceaselessly. No matter what the problem, McCullough always finds someone to quote who gives praise to Truman. The book is a popular biography, meaning McCullough does not attempt to analyze issues too much, but is more concerned with Harry, the common man who rose to the top. McCullough writes well and is very captivating (interest never flags, even at this length). Anyone with any interest at all in Truman will find this book rewarding and entertaining. For me, it also peaked my interest in Dean Acheson. Recommended.	2005-08-31

This book, written in 1939, is an excellent summary account of the cattle trade in the West, from 1580 to the early 1900s. He touches on just about everything having to do with his topic, from historical figures and events to equipment. I thought he spent a tad too much space on Billy the Kid, the Earps, and such (they don't seem that important to the cattle business), but he's an excellent writer. The first half of the book is the best. Recommended.	2005-08-31

Beat! Drums!\\" as his early contribution to the war effort. His brother George enlisted in the army and after he was wounded at Fredericksburg, Walt went to nurse him. Seeing the suffering of the wounded men moved him greatly, and he volunteered in the military hospitals in Washington. Faithfully Whitman attended to the wounded. Two volumes came out of this experience: DRUM-TAPS (poems) and SPECIMEN DAYS (reminiscences). He made many friends in the hospitals. It's this period in Whitman's life that Morris writes about. He captures the despair and courage that all were going through well. He looks at the poems produced by Whitman during this time as well at Whitman the man. Years later Whitman was dismayed that the war for most people had faded into distant memory. As a detailed look at a relatively short (though profound) period in Whitman's life, Morris's book will not fade into distant memory for most who read it.	2005-08-31

Lonnie Bannon narrates the story mainly of his grandfather, a tough old coot who owns the ranch and Hud, his wild half-brother. A disease breaks out with their cattle that forces them to slaughter the herd; the results have a devastating effect on both characters. Written before McMurtry's style took on the broad Dickensian humor of his later work, he manages to capture the place and the people very well and truthfully. A great start to a most illustrious career. [The movie HUD came from this book.]	2005-08-31

His poetry, always extremely personal and frank, and displaying great technical skill (he wrote in strict classical forms; only late in life did he write in free verse), was highly praised and prized: he won three Pulitzers. A Catholic convert, later an agnostic, he wrestled mightily with the Creator in his work. He suffered 8 nervous breakdowns during his life and was married three times. During the 1960s, he was a visible participant in the anti-war movement. Mariani is an excellent writer himself and tells Lowell's life story, from the successes to the heartbreaks, interestingly and well.	2005-08-31

In a large country it was difficult to do much touring when there was no means to do so except in a horse and buggy. The expansion of the railrods, therefore, contributed greatly to getting people to visit different places not necessarily on the beaten path. Pomeroy discusses railroad travel, resort hotels, dude ranches, California, the sportsmen (hunters and fishermen), health seekers, and other factors. The book attempts to cover a bit too much ground and comes across as somewhat superficial at times because of that. A decent introduction to the topic, however.	2005-08-31

Stampp admits there were many mistakes committed by the radical Republicans, and their idealistic aims, especially toward the blacks, might not have been so pure, but he believes if it wasn't for the radicals there would be no 14th or 15th Ammendments to the Constitution. As with most controversies, there is probably truth to be found on both sides of the argument. Stampp develops his argument carefully and fairly. What was truly tragic was the utter failure of the government (and the people) to prevent or even care any longer about the South's \\"experiment\\" with two separate societies, which began in earnest after Grant's two disastrous terms as President. Jim Crow would end up being almost as bad as slavery itself.	2005-08-31

It's set in 1938, and I thought it might have been an allegory about everyone getting along with one another and how uncivilized the world is - but it's hard to tell. Prokosch, who was also a poet, writes in a sensitive, poetic manner.	2005-08-29

Probably modern thoughts, inclusiveness, and realism. Told through the eyes of patriarch Roger Gale, the story concerns his three daughters: Edith, the devoted mother of five children; Deborah, a principal of a high school who is more interested in her students than in the man who loves her; and Laura, the \\"wild\\" one who marries, divorces, then runs off to Europe to remarry. Anyone reading the book back then probably could imagine herself as one of these women - they pretty much span the gamut of possibilities. It's actually a pre-modern \\"modern\\" novel, on the right track, but not able to fully realize the truly advanced writings of the twenties. Poole thought that portraying women as hedonists or social scientists was modern; it was, but his style is very old-fashioned, so that much of this comes across as overly melodramatic, even soap-operish. Poole was not the only author at this time to fail in this way; in fact, he might be among the better of the writers whose means of telling his story hadn't progressed as far as the story itself. Scott Fitzgerald's THIS SIDE OF PARADISE was only three years away.	2005-08-29

Grant stays for a while with the Thors, then leaves. But he's drawn back finally, more mature for his experiences.

Ambrose finds Eisenhower magnificent in every way and is blinded by his admiration. It's true that he criticizes Ike for some of his mistakes (his flaps with Montgomery, the failure to take Berlin, his ambivalence regarding major domestic issues as President), but it's obvious he likes to be done with them as quickly as possible so he can go back to telling what a great  person he was. Ike certainly had what it takes to be the supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe during the war. Someone once said of Clinton that as the economy was booming during the early '90s he had enough sense as President not to mess it up, and something similar could be said about President Eisenhower: times were booming, the world was at peace (after Korea), and he didn't meddle and mess things up. For Ambrose, Eisenhower \\"was one of the outstanding leaders of the Western world of this (20th) century.\\" The book is still out on that, I think. Also Ambrose is not able to match his incessant praises of his magnificent hero with a prose style worthy of such feelings: the writing is pedestrian at best. This is not the definitive biography of Eisenhower as proclaimed on the back cover. No way.	2005-08-29

The first half of the book is about village life and John's maturing; the second is about the War. Most critics praise Mitchell's War writing best, though I liked the first part best. To me his writing about the War seemed tired (he was 84 at the time). James gets wounded in the head and Mitchell drags it out too long. The love story between John and Leila is also somewhat shallow, and where Mitchell is trying to make them noble, he only makes them seem distant to each other. Mitchell was a highly respected physician in Philadelphia and was also well thought of as a writer of fiction during his day. This was his last novel; some of his earlier ones are quite good and don't deserve the total disregard they now receive.	2005-08-27

Cable was also a reformer, especially for prison reforms and equal treatment of blacks in the South; this latter view, made public in books such as THE SILENT SOUTH (1885), caused much outrage in the South. He believed that the separation of the races and especially the desire in the South to keep blacks \\"beneath\\" whites in all things was damaging to both races. Cable was also a very religious man and was very active in the church. Despite his popularity as an author and lecturer (he toured successfully with Mark Twain), Cable was often in debt, living on advances for his writing. Turner relates Cable's trials and tribulations, and his successes, very well in this biography. He writes well, never allowing his research to get in the way of his commanding style. Later in his career Cable wished to write stories that \\"make you feel today that you are enterained, and find tomorrow that you are profited.\\" Turner's biography does just that. Highly recommended.	2005-08-26

Elsmere's wife Catherine is a firm believer in the old traditions, and though she loves her husband greatly, she cannot accept his nonconformist views. He eventually leaves the church and devotes himself to helping the poor in London. The major criticism is that Elsmere loses his faith too quickly, which I think is true. Catherine, to my mind, ends up being the true hero of the book. Quite controversial in its day. Ward is an excellent writer, however, though this work is just a tad too long.	2005-08-26

It basically relates three generations of the Holmes family of Boston, beginning with The Reverend Abiel Holmes, who lost his parrish for being too old-fashioned and hell-fire Calvinist for his congregation; his son, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, author of AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE and other works and a Harvard professor of medicine; and his son, Oliver Wendell Holmes, jr, wounded three times in the Civil War, lawyer, and eventual Justice of the Supreme Court, where he became known as \\"The Great Dissenter\\" for disagreeing with majority opinions of the Court, usually arguing for less government control and more personal freedoms. Bowen does write with the point of view of a novelist, inventing dialogue and getting into her characters' heads in a way only a novelist could do. But she embellishes rather than distorts, I think. And the book is a joy to read and has the feel of authority and deep knowledge. I actually found it hard to put down, especially in the first half of the book. Highly recommended.	2005-08-26

Harding died suddenly in California in 1923, he was one of the most beloved President's ever. It wasn't long, however, before that opinion changed, so that today he is considered among the worst. The revelation after his death of the Teapot Dome scandal that occurred during his administration was paramount in destroying his reputation. And it involved oil (the naval oil reserves in Wyoming were being sold off by corrupt politicians close to Harding). Sinclair based this novel on Teapot Dome. It basically shows how a decent man and his son Bunny Ross are up against insurmountable odds in the oil business, what with corruption all around. Sinclair's solution was dramatic: for him socialism was the answer; capitalism was too corrupt. A big, brawling novel, not particularly memorable for its style; but its muscular approach and willingness to tackle important issues make it worth reading.	2005-08-18

Sam is born into a poor family in the midwest, quits school at 15 to work in a store, moves into telegraphy, then the wallpaper business, and finally owns his own investment company. He is ambitious and smart and knows how to make a dollar. He is also a good person. But he is not perfect - he marries the wrong woman at first, a woman who loves someone else - and he fails with a close friend and his son. It's a totally engrossing novel (except for maybe the last 40 pages, which drag - as if Flavin didn't know how or want to end it). It won the Pulitzer Prize and deservedly so. Read it and enjoy.	2005-08-15

Throughout the story he develops a theory that the world is too interested in wealth and property and burglery is a good thing. He has interesting conversations with criminals, and much of Davis's style is similar to Damon Runyon's. Davis is a terrific writer - funny and wise (despite the Socialist leanings). Someone needs to get Davis back in print again: he's too great a talent to be neglected the way he is.	2005-08-15

The major section consists of a series of 100 photographs presented in a Then & Now format: photos taken in the 1880's are compared with exact shots (same angle, location, etc.) taken roughly 100 years later. All of the photos depict various views of Yellowstone N.P. Comparisons are amazing: sometimes differences are subtle, other times very dramatic. (All are black & white.) It's amazing that the exact locations could be found, and the author declares that sometimes it was very difficult, requiring much detective work. The results are stunning. There are also chapters dealing with Yellowstone's geology, climate, vegetation, and the effect of human presence in the park. The book is truly monumental, worthy of its subject matter. Highly recommended.	2005-08-15

An excellent book that focuses on the human side of war, not the politics, the generalship, the maneuvering. An excellent addition to anyone's Civil War library.	2005-08-15

If that sounds like a familiar story today in the fictional world as well as the real, it probably is. What makes Heller's telling of this familiar story special is his voice: it is as matter-of-fact as possible. It was a brilliant stroke on Heller's part to speak in this voice because it truly makes his story as harrowing as could be. Slocum's 15-year-old daughter is going off the deep end filled with hatred and self-loathing; his son is acting like a stone monument; his baby boy appears to be retarded; and he's lost his love for his wife. On top of this he's about to take over another man's job in the office, a job he's not at all sure he wants. So life proceeds. The hateful/deceitful conversations he has with his daughter are masterfully developed and right-on believable. Heller captures the horrors of modern life (at least a segment of them) perfectly, though the book does go on too long. It's a harrowing book recounted in the most controlled prose style imaginable.	2005-08-14

The book is in three main sections: the physical setting (housing, furnishings, and clothing); the structure of the household (family connections, including servants); and individual development (childhood, coming of age, and old age). The most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the Court: although laws were not draconian, they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly. Mess up and you would be punished. But it's also true that people were not that different back then, either: parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them; families were at the core of society's welfare; even women were given rights denied them in the mother country. It's interesting that even these first settlers saw the American continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized, and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from Plymouth itself, thus weakening communal ties. A highly recommended book.	2005-08-12

To them if God was infinite, then He needed infinte space in which to occupy. Newton agreed with this argument. But Duns Scotus and later Leibniz showed that God's presence was not needed; He could act by His will alone. Thus God was removed from space without charges of atheism being leveled. \\"With God's departure, physical scientists finally had an infinite, three-dimensional, void frame within which they could study the motion of bodies without the need to do theology as well.\\" An interesting look at a fascinating subject.	2005-08-12

At first it sounds like the man is more in love with love than with Bernadette, his lover. He is also married, not necessarily unhappily either, though his wife is ill and soon (conveniently for the plot) dies. But before that happens, Bernadette becomes pregnant,and the story deepens from that point on. He and Bernadette decide to see each other while his wife is ill, though he continues to care for his wife with much love and tenderness. Bernadette tells him she will wait for him, and she does.

Brinkley attempts to show how Carter, though no longer a resident of the White House, took much of the Presidency with him in terms of what interested him and the power he still might wield in having an influence on world affairs. Carter got very involved in trying to help resolve conflicts around the world, from Panama and Haiti to North Korea and Bosnia. So focused on peace (and some might say the ever-elusive Nobel Peace Prize), Carter often could be a fly in the ointment of US policy, driving presidents (especially Clinton) up the wall. Carter is a micromanager, needing to know every detail. He is also a tireless worker, especially for what he perceives to be just causes. He has always put his faith above all other things, and might rank as the most decent public official Washington has seen in a long time, or can expect to see again. Brinkley is totally pro-Carter in all respects, though he is willing to point out how and where Carter got himself into trouble along the way. An interesting book about an interesting man.	2005-08-10

Death and property destruction were great, but even worse was the devastation of the community spirit and the long-lasting mental trauma suffered by the inhabitants. Erikson explores what he sees as a major dichotomy in the ethos of the \\"mountain people\\" involved in this disaster: a sense of independence versus a need for dependence. Erikson believes this seems to breed inaction and a total feeling of loss for these people in disasters such as this. There are, of course, other factors at work here, but it's an interesting theory. Comparisons to other similar disasters (hurricane victims in Florida, for example) would make for a worthwhile study.	2005-08-10

And here you thought Walter O'Malley was just a greedy bum (small \\"b\\")out to get rich, and that's why he moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn to LA. The real bum, though, was Robert Moses, who since the 1950s had been eyeing Flusing Meadows as the place to put a ballpark, which he kept pretty much a secret until the Dodgers had left town. (Think Shea Stadium.) O'Malley really wanted to stay in Brooklyn, but he needed a new ballpark to replace the decrepit Ebbets Field; Moses, who controlled all development in NYC, refused to accomodate him. Thus, when LA came calling with all kinds of incentives, O'Malley felt he no longer had a choice. Shapiro is a good journalist and writer, and delves into the inner dealings of all concerned thoroughly and with gusto. Like THE BOYS OF SUMMER, he also writes about the players, but not nearly as distinctively as Kahn did. He also spends too much time on the changing face of urban New York versus the booming suburbs of the 1950s, an important element to the story of what was happening to Brooklyn, but Shapiro hammers away at it too hard and long. Although slow in spots, the book tells a major story well: the writing is better than you will find in most sports-oriented books.<br /><br />Note: O'Malley had an architect from Princeton design a domed stadium that he just might have built in Brooklyn if given the chance. Now wouldn't that have been something!	2005-08-05

Convention of 1940 and How It Freed FDR to Save the Western World	Books	4	5	5	N	N	1940 Presidential Politics: A Coincidence?	That Wendell Wilkie was the only man on the Republican ticket in 1940 who made it possible for FDR to offer the military aid to Britain he wanted so desperately to give without it becoming so unpopular that he would lose the election, is an interesting idea, and although it's partially true (all the other Republican candidates were staunch isolationists), it's only hyperbole that, as Peters's subtitle declares, Wilkie's nomination \\"saved the Western world.\\" Wilkie feared and hated Hitler, and the possibility that Britain would fall, as France had done, was very real, with grave consequences for the US. Thus he was all in favor of Roosevelt's wanting to help the British militarily, as well as reinstituting the draft (the first time there would ever be a peace-time draft in America). Peters is best when recounting the events at the Republican convention in Philadelphia, showing how Wilkie came out of nowhere to snag the nomination. He is also good at showing how Roosevelt came around to \\"accepting\\" a third-term nomination by the Democrats. Peters is a popular historian, however, and is weakest when attempting to sketch \\"background\\" to put events in context, and worst of all, when he even makes himself a part of the story at the beginning as an interested 13-year-old at the time. Although the book is not necessarily shallow, it's also not very deep: I read the book in one sitting. Interesting, but not essential.	2005-08-04
US	28644226	R23MEKOLG42BXF	055320937X	829962554	The Child Buyer	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Sharp satire	This is a biting satire of the educational system. A man (Wissey Jones) is being investigated for wanting to buy a child. He owns a company that, through drugs and surgery, turns kids into emotionless thinking machines. Local school officials are lampooned as they investigate Jones and his scheme. When the book was written (1960), American educators were in a frenzy over Sputnik and the thought that the Russians had gained the upper hand in the Space (read \\"Brain\\") Race, and more effort was needed to go into educating children. Hersey was questioning at what expense, and to what extreme, all this would go. (Ten years later, of course, and education was going in the opposite direction to a lessening of standards and rigor.) At times the book comes across as overly didactic, being told in the form of \\"Hearings.\\" But overall it's an interesting story, well told.	2005-08-03

He was finally able to escape and make his way back to Union lines. What distinguishes this book is Ransom's humor in the face of such adversity: \\"July 26 - Ain't dead yet. Actually laugh at the Rebel who thought if I wasn't dead I had better get inside. Had an onion.\\" He writes of the hardships, mainly hunger and disease, but also makes it clear that the prisoners, because of poor self-discipline and low morals (stealing from one another was rampant) made their bad lot even worse. Prisoner exchanges, once frequent early in the war, were just about suspended by this time, thanks to U.S. Grant's belief that they helped the South more than the North. At one point Ransom writes that about 130 prisoners a day were dying in camp, mostly from disease. An interesting book, lively and always in celebration of the living, at least in spirit.	2005-08-03

Hutchinson writes well and with dry Bitish humor. He also has great insights into why Marko and Mabel fail as a couple. I like this novel a lot. Perhaps the most powerful scene is near the end, after Marko has taken into his house a young woman who is pregnant. This causes his wife to leave him and sue for divirce. It looks very bad for Marko because it looks like he's the father. But he learns, after the girl commits suicide, that his boss's son is the father. He goes to his boss to chastise him, only to learn that the boy has just been killed in the war. He ends up praising him. A wonderful novel.	2005-08-03

A few months later, he killed himself. Ross appears to have been an over-achiever who thought he'd written The Great American Novel, and couldn't stand the critics panning it. He also had tremendous difficulty with his publisher (Houghton-Mifflin), who demanded large cuts and much rewriting, under great pressure. The suicide is still a tough thing to comprehend, though, since once the book was published it was selling fairly well and had sold to Hollywood.

She hastily marries the brother of her brother-in-law, only to learn he was married before and his wife might still be alive. She leaves him and comes home. The abuse continues, only worse: they won't let her tell people the truth about what happened, making her take on the blame. She eventually builds up courage and leaves, to marry quickly again. This second marriage is a major fault in the book - it's too tacked on and hasty. Gale's tone and focus, though, are sharp.	2005-07-29

Substitute \\"interesting\\" for the words \\"right\\" and you'll have what Levitt & Dubner present in FREAKONOMICS, though right might be the case, too (but it's hard to tell). What caused crime to drastically decrease during the 1990s when all signs predicted a continued increase? Why do real estate agents sell their own homes differently than ours? What are the real predictors for success in school (over-zealous parents be damned: it's not what you do but what you are that seems to matter)? Why do many drug dealers still live with their moms? These are just a few of the questions Levitt & Dubner ask, and for the most part their answers are intriguing. (Though sometimes it's the same old answer, as with the last question above: drug dealing, like most businesses, pays the big bucks to only those few at the very top of the organizational chart.) At times the authors ramble a bit before making their points, but usually it's worth the wait. I doubt it would be hard to dispute most of their findings, though I would also venture to say that much of what they posit is not the ONLY reason for what might be going on. A quick read and not at all technical, most who read this book should come away with some interesting ideas to ponder about why some things are the way they are, as well as an appreciation that the way data are looked at might be the key to their understanding.	2005-07-27

This was Marquand's field, and he reaped a very rich crop from his endeavors. In this, one of his best novels, Charley Gray (an apt name) ponders whether he will get the promotion to Vice President in the bank in which he's employed. He goes back to his home town of Clyde, Maine (Marquand's own Newburyport, MA), for some soul searching. He gets the promotion, but wonders how much of his soul he has to give up for it. Irony is Marquand's main tool in his writing, and he explores his characters' lives with great honesty and insight. One comes away from a novel like this with the feeling that we've come to know the characters as well as we could expect, and their problems and concerns command out attention. Marquand at his best.	2005-05-10

There are scores of detailed maps and charts, and many, many photographs. What I found most interesting were the chapters on historical tours across the region, with just about every town and hamlet described. (There are also whole chapters on Fort Smith, Hot Springs National Park, and Little Rock.) This is not only a great book to have with you if visiting the area, but it's also a terrific book for armchair travelers as well. A wonderful guidebook, highly recommended.	2005-05-08

The book is broken down by sections of the state and then by county, making it easy for the traveler to plan out an itinerary. Maps of each section are also included. Fitzgerald has done his research well and thoroughly. There are lots of photographs as well. Although Fitzgerald draws out the temptation to get in the car and seek out many of the towns he describes, the book will give just as much satisfaction to the armchair traveler, too.

Maclean tries to get to the heart of what happened - why some survived and 13 didn't. Apparently those that lost their lives tried to outrun the fire, which was like trying to outrun a train.

He published two giant collections of dirty jokes that included extensive analyses of the jokes, their origins, comparative versions, and other scholarly concerns. He did the same for the bawdy limerick. THE HORN BOOK is a kind of apologia of erotica with longish articles on erotic collections and folklore, including bawdy ballads, the limerick, and the formation of a motif index for this type of work. It's pretty esoteric, but Legman is an interesting writer and, needless to say, knows his subject well.

Perhaps for this reason, though the book is thorough, it reads somewhat shallow. Of all the inventions of Edison, Baldwin writes in detail only about 2 of them: the phonograph and motion pictures. He also spends a great deal of space covering Edison's work in the iron ore mine he owned in Ogdensburg, NJ, and his experiments with rubber, both of which produced negligible results. I found Matthew Josephson's 1959 biography on Edison to be much better.	2005-04-09

Kellog comes across as a martinette advocating risky diets and enemas to patients. Boyle can be pretty funny at times as he skewers Kellog and his shinanigans, and, of course, the arm of his satire reaches right up to today and the health fad industry, much of which is just as nutty as anything Kellog was advocating. Besides this novel, other books by Boyle I've read are RIVEN ROCK and WORLD'S END, and I've found that of the three this is the only one that actually tells a story.

Josephson focuses as much on Edison's work as he does on the man, and the book can be somewhat technical at times. It is natural to compare it to Neil Baldwin's EDISON: INVENTING THE CENTURY, written in 1995, and Josephson's Edison is much more solid than Baldwin's. Baldwin sacrifices the inventions while dealing mainly with the man; Josephson is much more rounded and deals with all aspects of Edison's life. Highly recommended.	2005-04-09

Isaac Cline was the chief meteorologist in Galveston at the time of the storm, and Larson tries to center him in the story. Not a whole lot was understood about hurricanes in 1900, and this one fooled everybody. The storm surge (the sea rose 4 feet in 5 seconds) was the major killer. Larson does an excellent job, especially in \\"humanizing\\" the event around Cline's response to it, despite an over desire to find irony in most things. An excellent and interesting book.	2005-04-01

The emphasis is on the Gold Rush, railroads, and modern times. Lavender is rather critical of the state in recent times, but doesn't try to get at the character of the state. (Perhaps it's too varied for that.) Someone interested in a quick overview of the state might find this book useful, but it's not essential reading. Lavender has done much better work elsewhere.	2005-04-01

It covers the state from 4 angles: as a major byway (but no stopping place) during trail days; as the first state to grant women suffrage; as the Cowboy state; and as an energy producing state. Interesting as far as it goes, but it's pretty much just a cursory overview. There are better books about Wyoming; Larson himself has written some of them.	2005-04-01

Edward Teach (Blackbeard) ruled over unruly seamen and struck terror in coastal towns in North Carolina (Bath, Edenton). He also had 14 wives! He was killed in Orakoke Inlet by Robert Maynard, who was sent by the governor of Virginia. It's an interesting story in our Colonial history, but Lee is not so compelling a writer.

That's not to say that they don't become somewhat repetitive after a while, which they do. Seagrave has a main hypothesis he tries to prove along with the intriguing stories: those who survived had the will to survive, and special knowledge might help, but plays second fiddle to the will.

The search goes in two dirctions: to foreign remains of flu victims buried in the arctic tundra near Brevig, Alaska; and to a government warehouse in Washington, DC.

The U.S. Senate, of course, voted it down. I found it interesting how the country (and Wilson) had strong socialist leanings, especially in international affairs, until War was declared in 1916, when a huge reaction took effect. Knock does a good job relating events and portraying Wilson as one whose ideas for truly ending warfare was convincing to world leaders but not his own country. The effort of trying to persuade his countrymen of the importance of a League probably broke his health and led to his death. Recommended.	2005-03-30

This excellent book portrays the life and death of the New York Herald Tribune. The Herald began in 1835, founded by James Gordon Bennett, a leading paper of the yellow journalism school. The Tribune, a powerful and highly literate Republican paper, was founded by Horace Greeley in 1841. The two papers combined in 1924, and from that time on, until its demise in 1966, was one of the most important newspapers in the country; many would say the best paper ever. After WW II the paper got mired in financial straits; a failure to expand in the booming NY suburbs or to be technologically innovative kept circulation lowest among NY dailys in the 1950s. The union strike in 1964 was the paper's death knell. Kluger leaves few stones unturned in recounting the paper's history; I personally wanted more on the paper's last decade or two. But at 800 pages, I can't really complain. Monumental.	2005-03-29

He knocked around the cattle country, learned cowboying, and used his knowledge as the basis of his fiction. This book, not really fiction at all, is about his experiences as a cowboy. It is remembered best for James's writing style, which is slangy and semi-literate, but perfect for what he's trying to accomplish. It's all about riding and roping, rustlers, and fencing the plains - and it's all very nostalgic. Interesting and quite a good book of its kind.	2005-03-28

He became a professional gambler (and drunk), and was in Tombstone for the fight at the O.K. Corral. Johns tells Holliday's story in a non-scholarly, conversational manner, and can be quite sardonic at times. This makes the book entertaining and pleasurable to read. She also offers lots of quotes from contemporary newspapers. Factually it's accurate; a more modern biography might get into more psychobabbling over Doc's motives and behavior, but I don't miss any of that at all.

He worked as a spy for the OSS, focusing on Germany's progress with the atom bomb. He lived a very secretive life. Comparing this book to the later THE CATCHER WAS A SPY by Nicholas Dawidoff, the eccentricities that Dawidoff made much of (Moe's strange obsession with newspapers, the mooching off friends and family, the lonely, self-exhile type of existence he led) are glossed over here, if dealt with at all. There is more depth in the Dawidoff book in a tell-all sort of way; Kaufmann, et.al. keep their distances from the man and ignore what might be considered unpleasantries.

Rob of the Bowl is a legless man who maneuvers himself in a bowl-like contraption.

At first she despises Percy, but after many adventures (some among the Indians), sword fights, pirating, and the eventual death of Carnal, who had come to America to pursue Jocelyn, true love wins out. Johnston is good at forwarding the action throughout the story, but some of the incidents are pretty far-fetched.

A local band known as the Lowrie Gang rebels; in addition, there's a love interest between Lowrie and Rhoda Strong, an Indian, who foresakes Lowrie for her people.

An eye injury in college hindered his sight, meaning much of his research was read to him; but he was not blind. (It's amazing how our two greatest narrative historians, Prescott and Francis Parkman,  could barely see.) He also had a lazy streak, and an addiction to writing for the North American Review, both of which cut into his historical writing work. Gardiner's biography is well written, but not deep; little is said about Prescott's works, and the ending is very rushed. Not a definitive biography by any means.	2005-03-13

Gardner relates his story with authority. Subtitled \\"A Pastoral Novel,\\" the book is less a continuous story than a reaction to events that occur over time in the same locale.

He is not overly sad or depressed, feels things have gone pretty well so far--BUT (there's always that 'but') underneath all that is a terrible feeling of sadness, regret, and loss. Ford is an excellent writer, moving and provocative, and is able to capture those nebulous emotions just below the surface perfectly. Bascombe returns in \\"Independence Day,\\" which is more of the same emotional bipolarity. \\"The Sportswriter\\" is an excellent novel.	2005-03-12

This is the most Hemingway-ish of Ford's books, and the writing is crisp and clear. But there is also a certain coldness and distance from emotions displayed in the prose that's hard to understand.

Basically a floater through life, he can't complain too much: business is good, his girl friend is not too demanding, life is okay. But again, just as in the earlier novel, it's what's just beneath the glossy surface that matters--and where Bascombe's life verges on disaster. Ford deals with this dichotomy masterfully. Yes, it's a long book and slow to develop, but I never found my interest waning in Bascombe's take on his life. Won the Pulitzer Prize, and deservedly so.	2005-03-12

He does this by looking at the lives of 20 representative men, from radical politicians to scientists, from fire-and-brimstone religious fanatics to writers and humorists. The Southern mind was a strange one: stuck on the Romantic past, Calvinistic, anti-progress in all things, and obsessed with the slavery issue. In the 1820s it looked as if slavery might disappear (it was economically detrimental), but new cotton gin inventions/improvements, Abolitionist strong-armedness, and other factors made slavery suddenly seem like a necessity. Much of the Southern make-up seemed like so much smoke and mirrors--and self-delusionment. They hated the thought of a strong federal government, and that, tempered with an honor code that took precedence over all behavior (a superficial code at that) made the Civil War inevitable. Eaton's account is interesting and authoritative. Recommended.	2005-03-08

Then on a snowy night, the deserted child Eppie makes her way into his cabin. He adopts her and experiences much joy; his love for Eppie replaces his love for gold. The stolen gold is discovered at the bottom of a pond, and when her real father comes to claim her, Eppie refuses to leave Silas. A powerful and moving story, beautifully told.

Unusual, to say the least, but DeVaux shows how it all makes sense.

Floyd Dell was among the first wave of post-WW I writers who were disillusioned by the war, but hadn't developed a style yet (a la Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Dos Passos, and others) to express that disillusionment. Thus while striving to be new (modern), Dell is stuck in the old. This novel, a sequel to \\"Moon Calf,\\" is about restlessness: a marriage flounders and characters complain about life being too easy and meaningless. The world to them is a \\"pasteboard world.\\" This is a modern sentiment, but Dell can't make the transition into modernism to express it: his style and approach are still old-fashioned, closer to Edith Wharton, say, than to Hemingway. This odd mixture of modern concerns with old-fashioned method causes the novel to be a disappointment.	2005-03-06

He gives basically three reasons for the devastation: 1) the night before there was a major fire in the city that destroyed much property, knocked out fire-fighting equipment, and exhausted firefighters; 2) a relentless SW wind fanned the flames; and 3) Chicago was a city made of wood.

The power, of course, lies with Eleanor, but Gilbert is true to his childhood love. The ending is a bit strained when Beatrix refuses to believe that Gilbert loves her and asks for proof. He rescues her from a kidnapping which is very melodramatic. Eleanor is much the more interesting character, and Crawford portrays her, with all her faults (she is, after all, married to the King of France), admirably.

A second volume was planned by Cole, but he died before he could get to it. The most interesting sections of the book are the ones dealing with Boas's field work in British Columbia along with other giants in anthropology such as Teit and George Hunt.

Phil and Leonard Chess were a couple of Jewish immigrants who wanted to make money and saw a way to do so through the recording of black music (mostly blues, r&b, r&r, soul--some jazz) in the windy city. The Chess roster was impressive and featured the best of the post-WW II blues singers (Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Howling Wolf, Little Walter, just to name a few). Leonard was a tough cookie willing to help his uneducated, living-on-the-edge stable of artists--help, but no charity. The company was sold in the late 60s and soon after collapsed. I had the good fortune to speak with Nadine Cohadas about this book (and the book she wrote about Dinah Washington), and she was dedicated to getting the facts right and tracking down every lead. She was fascinated by her subject, and I think she conveys that well in the book. Scholarly, but not stuffy.	2005-03-03

He then visits three women he cares/cared about: his mother, a college girlfriend, and a childhood sweetheart, Tory, who takes up with him. But then Jadis returns and Egg wonders if he can love both of them. Far be it from me to tell what he decides to do. Chowder tells the story in a very breezy style that is often very humorous.

Her husband Lester is a poet at heart and dreamer who gets fired from his accounting job. Shortly afterward he falls off the roof and is badly hurt. So Eva goes to work and Lester stays home with the kids--a huge success for both of them. But society expects Lester to go back to work again and Eva to stay home \\"where she belongs.\\" Neither one wants this. Canfield explores this dilemma involving traditional roles fairly well, but not with any great skill or insight.	2005-02-28

It started out as rain, then quickly and fiercely changed to snow. The snow piled up quickly; when the temperature plummeted, much of the snow turned to ice. The wind was wicked. I think worse storms might have hit since then, but this one was a killer: hundreds died. It also was the impetus for building the NYC subway system. Definitely a YA book without a whole lot of depth to it.	2005-02-28

Brown deals with these events and then some, all in a somewhat cursory way, but is mostly concerned with the Centennial and the election. The book is no more than a fairly routine popular history, the year chosen ultimately to highlight the Bicentennial in 1976.	2005-02-27

Of course Thyrza never reveals who the father of her child is, and no one guesses Andy. Throughout it all, Barton Gorse loves Thyrza and wants to marry her, but she refuses, believing that if she does, everyone will think Barton is the father. The first half of the book, about Thyrza's childhood, is not so good, but the second half is very fine, though the length Thyrza goes to protect Barton is a bit hard to believe. But despite what it might sound like, Thyrza's strength of character is made memorable by Brown's portrayal of her. Sometimes all the idealistic reasoning, so old-fashioned today, is difficult to fathom, but it's even more difficult not to sympathize, even admire, such characters as Thyrza Tennant.	2005-02-27

One affair involves a single man with a married woman; the other a single woman with a married man. In the first, many years after Tom Simpkins and Norma Moffat have been secretly meeting and loving one another, Norma's husband dies. Tom wants to marry her, but her children (one of whom, Shirley, has been fathered by Tom) learn of this affair and rebel, especially Shirley. After much agony and tremendous effort (and love) on Tom's part, things begin to mend; Tom and Norma marry and all looks well. The alternate, though intertwining, story concerns Andrea and her love for a married local teacher, Philip Hart. They also grow to love each other immensely, but Philip's wife learns of their relationship with the result being misery for all involved. Barstow could have easily had these characters run to the divorce courts and that would've been that, but he explores their relationships carefully and with all seriousness. He believes that one can love more than one person, though differently, and want to keep doing so. Barstow is an excellent writer, and all the pieces of this novel jell perfectly by book's end. Highly recommended.	2005-02-27

When I first read this when it first came out, I was very moved by it. Reading it a second time now I find much of the action just wasted energy.

Bowers is of the older school that found the Radical Republicans, led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, with their ideas of punishing the South for seceeding and forcing equality for blacks in the South, especially at the polls, were disastrous for the South. This view has been hotly debated; for a revisionist view see Stampp's \\"The Era of Reconstruction.\\" Bowers, despite his controversial views, is an interesting historian: his style is personal and flamboyant. His emphasis is on tragedy, and his tone echoes that sentiment. To him Andrew Johnson was fighting the good fight of A. Lincoln and sought moderation in black suffrage and ease at allowing Southerners to become US citizens again; Stevens et. al. were evil monsters. An interesting book, nowhere dull.	2005-02-26

Edmund Wilson among others thought it one of the best war novels in our literature. Boyd is a fierce realist (he was a soldier in the war, too) and pulls no punches. Death and misery are everywhere, and no one really knows what they're doing there. But Boyd is only a mediocre writer, and the realism, though praiseworthy, is not enough. The writing is flat.	2005-02-26

As if this weren't enough trouble, she falls in love with Harry Mynors who is only interested in her money.

Scott Fitzgerad, Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe being especially noteworthy (and dealt with at length in this biography). One might envy such a man with such a job, but Berg makes it clear that having to deal with the likes of these authors was like walking around with a huge millstone around Max's poor neck. His job was endless and thankless (Wolfe actually betrayed him). You see from the many letters quoted that many of them are blatant pleas for money. Saying that Perkins had to coddle some of these authors like children would be putting it mildly. Berg does an admirable job relaying Perkins's life and hard times. Recommended.	2005-02-23

Bloody Nathan on the one hand is a peace-loving Quaker who wouldn't hurt a fly; at other times he's the feared Jibbenainosay, a secretive, brutal killer of Indians in the Kentucky wilderness. Being Quaker, Nathan talks with the ever-present \\"thees\\" and \\"thous\\" in every sentence, which becomes somewhat comical after a while. But when he turns into the Nick of the Woods, he's the brutal slayer of all things Shawnee. His own family was murdered by Indians (thus the transformation), and when he finally avenges those murders, he disappears and is never heard from again. Very sensational with no holds barred, though Bird at times is too melodramatic and stilted. Sort of a classic of its kind. I liked it.	2005-02-23

The novel is a leisurely, old-fashioned study of the way people lived their lives--the novel of manners.

Nature provided an excessive amount of water from heavy rains and snow all that winter--flood levels were higher than ever, earlier than ever. But faulty policy (a levee-only approach to flood control), southern arrogance (business interests succeeded in saving New Orleans at the expense of many others who were never compensated for their losses as promised), and, of course, racism (whites tried to \\"enslave\\" blacks on the levees to make them work and keep them from migrating north) all contributed to the disaster. Whole counties were under 3 to 20 feet of water, one million people were displaced. The flood affected many things: it swept Hoover into the White House (Coolidge refused to do anything to help the people); it changed peoples' view of what the role of government should be in these kinds of disasters; it destroyed the myth of the white-black patronage system (blacks working the land as sharecroppers in exchange for the \\"protection\\" of whites); and it changed the way the great river would be managed (spillways would be built). Barry tells all of this excellently, in the old narrative history style of the great historians of the past, making it interesting at every turn. Highly recommended.	2005-02-20

She falls in love with Lee Clavering, an ambitious young journalist. Even after telling him the truth about herself, he wants to marry her. But she marries an Austrian prince instead in order to pursue a diplomatic career. In the book at one point Atherton has the Countess describe the modern novel as \\"gloomy, pessimistic, excoriating, merciless, drab, sordid, and hideously realistic.\\" Many of those terms describe this novel, too. Atherton was an old-fashioned novelist who thought she could be modern if she talked modern. But this book is very old-fashioned and a bit tiresome as well.	2005-02-20

The miserly and generally nasty Lemuel Shackford is found murdered, and his cousin Richard is accused. Richard works for the Slocum Marble Yard and is in love with Margaret Slocum, the owner's daughter. Richard eventually proves his innocence and all is well. This novel is believed to be the first in which a detective appears, and, interestingly, he gets it all wrong (he thinks Richard is guilty). Richard and Margaret are a bit too good, and why Richard would want his cousin's blessing for his upcoming marriage (Shackford is murdered right after this heated meeting and helps point the finger at Richard) is hard to believe.
