A woman is brutally attacked and sustains a concussions and has recurring epiletic episodes because it.  She is sure it was her husband - partially from the fact they were having very bad marital problems and he had abused her in the past.  Because of this, he goes to jail -- but later another man confesses and he is released. <br /> <br />She now has to come to terms that he may not have been the one who attacked her -- but she is still sure of it in her own mind.   <br /> <br />I had an accident and sustained a concussion (it was a pedestrian/auto and I had no recurring seizures) but I know what she was going through and what she remembered and did not remember.  I remember coming to curb of the street but did not remember the pickup hitting me - or did I?   <br /> <br />Fantastic book.  I recommend it.   <br /> <br />	2005-08-08

It is really the story about two different men: Robert Cutler (who dies early) and Francis (Spud) Pinkham - and who is really the greatest man of Cedar Hole.  It is a story of redemption - Bernie and Kitty -- and -- Jackie and Francis - the stories of families and what makes them tick.  Robert thinks of the city as his family and forsakes to a certain extent his wife and children for the town library.  Francis wants to separate himself from his family of rough sisters but finds he is still attached and devoted when one of them dies. <br /> <br />All of this is told with a wry sense of humor.  The best part of the book is about the antique desk and Bernie's jealously and quest to keep it at all costs.   <br />	2005-08-08

I tried, I really tried to like the Da Vinci Code, but I could not finish it.<br />It has a great story line, and Mr. Brown could have created great twists and turns with it--but he ran out of gas.  His style included a big twist (like a murder) in the story--then for twenty pages, the characters would talk about it.  Another big twist; and another twenty pages of discussion.<br />That, and the fact he took true facts, tweaked them considerably, and then presented them to the reader as fact.<br />I would have even liked if the book if it had been well written, but it was not.  Run on sentences, changes of person and numerous other discretions of writing made for a very choppy read.<br />I really tried to like this book, but could not.	2004-02-09

This is the best book of the series and well worth the read.  <br />At the time of the Falklands War, the author decided to hike 500 miles around the southwest coast of Britain.

It was a good book for light reading as Hamish is very likeable character.  <br />While Hamish solves these little mysteries, such as the husband batterer and the nursing home scandal, but his attention keeps getting drawn back to the village of Stoyre where strange happenings are occurring to the townpeople.  Is this village truly haunted, or is it something else more sinister?  It is up to Hamish, but not so much as to draw attention to his heroics - because then he might get promoted.  <br />Hamish wants to stay in Lochdubh with his dog, Lugs.  He definitely does not want to be promoted in any way.  <br />How he does solve the mystery of Stoyre, and how he gets non-promoted makes for a delightful book for all Hamish MacBeth.

I am really trying to like this trilogy--thus this was the reason I forged headlong into the second book of the Berrybender family.  I was not disappointed.  The Berrybender family is what made the American West WILD.<br />This erstwhile second tome continues the wandering of the Berrybender family finding them at a trading post waiting for spring to arrive so they can again go on their trip across through the old American West (their Wild West).  As usual, they are arguing with each other and with others - the others being an assorted of local fur trappers and renegades.  Tasmin is waiting for her child to be born while her father, having most of his appendages shot off (except the important one) thereby becoming mad as a hatter.  <br />Along with this, Mary and Bobbety get randy in their own right continuing the insatisable sexual appetities of the Berrybender family into the next generation. <br />This book is not at all like Lonesome Dove, but more like a farcical rendition of Lonesome Dove.  Read it, and enjoy the Wild West through the eyes of the Berrybender family.	2003-06-03

But--though she presents very hard circumstantial facts to persuade the reader that artist Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, Ms. Cornwell also presents rather lax circumstantial facts relating to other murders that may or may have not been the work of Sickert.  This could leave the reader scratching his or her head as to &quot;why?&quot;<br />All in all, it was a very enjoyable book even though it was on the technical side, but you wouldn't expect anything else from Ms. Cornwell.  The circumstantial evidence she discloses is well documented and well versed.  It is a shame she was not at the O.J. Simpson trial-the verdict might have been different.  <br />I will be glad when Ms. Cornwell gets back to the Scarpetta saga; but in the meantime, I thoroughly enjoyed this current book of her.	2003-05-19

The peopetry in this book not written by a person per se, but by a dog -- and maybe sometimes a dog's poetry does not rhyme - but at least it comes from his heart.  Roy Blount, Jr., the author behind the dogs' poetry, even explains as much in the introduction.  This book is about dogs and their poetry. <br />Because of this, the book becomes even more enjoyable.  The reader can look at the magnificent photos and read the poetry that that dog wrote for it.  The dog's poetry is a \\"canine measure of somewhere between ordered and free,\\" which shows the inner workings of all dogs.  As in the poem, \\"Good Stick,\\" you know exactly how the dog feels about his stick because - the dog itself wrote the poem.  Dogs converse on baths, expensive shoes, treats - everything that is important to them.  But the title of the book sums it up perfectly.  Who wouldn't look at their dog (who may or may not have done something naughty) and find him replying, \\"If Only You Knew How Much I Smell You.\\"<br />This is a great book for any dog lover.	2003-04-30

Bow's Boy is one those secret gems of a book a reader finds among the morass of today's cardboard fiction. <BR> <BR>Bowman Epps has never set foot in a courtroom, but he is one of the best criminal appeals attorneys in the state of Wisconsin.  <br />Ginger Piper is a small town hero.  He will always be remember for the game-winning goal he made at the championship basketball game--even though he comes from one of the poorest families in Laroque.<br />Bowman operates one thing: logic.  This is what makes him such a successful criminal appeals attorney.  Even though a person in jail should be in jail, Bowman can always find the most finite flaw from that man's trial and set his free.  Seeing, Ginger Piper speak at a Vietnam casualty funeral, Bowman can see in him some of these same attributes that he sees in himself, and Bowman takes Ginger under his wing.  <br />But things go awry with Ginger, and Bowman has to decide against logic and take a stand on Ginger.  How these two individuals interact with each other in the turmoil of the 1960's America makes for a great story and gripping novel.  <br />At the same time, as this book takes place during the Viet-nam war, America was at its own grip with its own logic - should we fight or should we not fight.  <br />Together, these two events tie this book into a concise story on the state of mind in the 1960s.  Read it and reap great rewards for yourself.	2002-12-10

He was a brilliant pupil destined for great things in London's society, but he threw it all away when he was caught stealing money.   He as going to give this money Nell Harrison, a young prostitute with whom he was infatuated.  Because of this grave mistake, he went to prison for a short time and then to America where he taught school and wrote short stories for a Chicago newspaper.  He eventually returned to England but never rose from the humiliation he suffered when caught stealing.  <br />This humiliation had ramifications on his thoughts about society also.  He had two attitudes toward the poor.  He sympathized with the \\"deserving\\" poor but hated the rest in that he believed poverty corrupted the human soul and any correction of the ill was futile.  <br />The novel, Will Warburton, is about this guilty secret.  Warburton runs a grocery store when he loses his money by loaning it to his \\"friend\\" who always fails in sudden business ventures.  Though Gissing's eyes, Warburton therefore potentially suffers the humiliation of middle class eyes that Gissing himself always feared.  Warburton is \\"just a grocer\\" and can never rise again above that \\"class.\\"<br />Though it is one of Gissing's minor writings, it is a complex novel but an enjoyable one.

It is not, but it is a great book in its own right.  <br />I started out reading Sin Killer thinking it was another McMurtry western but decided it was a black comedy western with a lot of slap stick through in for good measure.  Once you discover this, settle back for a read of your life.  <br />Sin Killer is the first part of a planned four-part epic about the Berrybender family, a rich spoiled family who comes from England in the 1840s to spend some time on western frontier shooting every live animal they can find.  But, in their avarice, they do not realize just how dangerous the old West can be to them instead.  <br />The flamboyant and eccentric cast of characters make their way on their luxurious steamboat up the Missouri River.  Little do they know what awaits them.  Foremost, there is a eldest daughter Tasmin who often disembarks from the boat for treks of her own.  There, she meets Sin Killer, a wild--yet fanatically religious--man of the frontier.  In a short space of time, they meet, she falls for him, they get married and she gets pregnant, all before returning to the steamer.  While she is gone, her mother falls down the stairs and dies, her father shoots himself in the foot and several of the entourage disappear in the wilds of the frontier to be kidnaped by Indians.  My favorite character was Prince Tallyrand, but you will have to read the book to see who that is.  <br />I really didn't know what to make of this book, yet I was fascinated by it and could not put it down.  I am now waiting eagerly for the next installment to see what happens to this odd family and Sin Killer in the early American West.	2002-06-25

Black Notice is definitely not one of Patricia Cornwell's better Kay Scarpetta books.  <br />In this book, Kay seems even more sorry for herself and mad at the world while dealing with the death of her lover; Lucy is embittered to the point of self destruction and Marino--well, Marino is just Marino.  <br />And in this book, the mystery was not as taut as in the previous novels.  It begins satisfactorily when a dead and decaying body is found in the cargo hole of a ship, but the plot does not develop.  In fact, it becomes rather convoluted, especially when Marino and Scarpetta go to Paris to help the Interpol. The story then evolves into a unbelievable mishmash with spectors of werewolves running amok through the streets of Richmond, Virginia.  <br />This is not to say that you should not read this book especially if you are a Kay Scarpetta fan.  Despite its faults, it is an enjoyable read, and I recommend it because of that.	2002-06-25

Sure, Kay seems unhappy all the time, Lucy (her niece) seems belligerent and Pete Marino an endless drunk, but if you read these mysteries from the beginning you will drawn into each of their lives and begin to savor them like an old soap opera.  You will find yourself wondering if Kay will ever find true love, Lucy will settle down, and Marino will find a life. <br />All this is happening while the next mystery is unfolding, and what a mystery it is!  A horse farm has been completely gutted by a horrendous fire destroying everything on it, including several thoroughbred horses.  Then, suddenly in the fire's ashes a body has been found that has not been destroyed by the fire due to the fact that a large plate glass has fallen on it, protecting it from the heat.  It is up to Kay now to found out how the fire started and how; and who was the girl and who would want her murdered.<br />At the same time, psycho killer Carrie Gretchen has escaped from the psychiatric facility where she was imprisoned for her serial killer spree.  Now she wants revenge on Kay and everyone connected with her. <br />This book is wonderfully written as usual with extreme detail on the arson investigations and burn victims.  There are surprise twists and unsuspecting turns.  All in all, it is a great mystery.	2002-06-24

He tells of his escape of this environment and lonely childhood when he discovers the language and world of William Shakespeare.  <br />It is not a book about Bob Smith's devotion to his sister, but his endeavor to escape the confines of his sister even though he loved her very much.  The main aspect of the book was his intertwining of Shakespearian passages in describing his past life and his present life when he teaches the elderly the wonders of the Bard.  This in itself really opens up so many facets of how he felt.  He is the Hamlet of his life and his mother is Lady MacBeth with his sister being Ophelia.  <br />Though his writing is rather florid at times, this is an amazing first book by Mr. Smith.  Without the Shakespearian prose interspersed throughout the passages, it might have been just another memoir, but Mr. Smith has turned it into a book that flows.  The reader can even start comparing aspects of their own life with Shakespeare just as the elderly do in his classes.<br />Read it and compare it with your own life.	2002-06-19

I wish Willie Morris had not died so young because I found his work so enjoyable, and it would have been wonderful to read even more of his writing.  <br />I would not put Mr. Morris up on the same level as Mark Twain (and he probably would not want it either), but this book reminds me in a lot of ways of Tom Sawyer--a young boy's life on the Mississippi Delta.  Everyone should experience these memories, whether in real time or vicariously. <br />He tells of his childhood in Yazoo City, Mississippi, with all his childhood friends, including Spit McGee (the forty's Huckleberry Finn).  He recalls their baseball games, football games, hunting on the Delta with his father, practical jokes played on anyone and everyone.  He recounts the story of the Witch of Yazoo and the broken chain.  One of the best and most humorous of his stories is the tale of the haunted house and what the boys found in it one dark and stormy night.  <br />I best remember in this book the chapters of a typical day in the life of a boy his age in Yazoo City--a day in the summer and a day in the fall.  These are great vignettes and very poignant pulling in the reader to want to recall his or her own childhood memories.<br />This is a great memoir and can be enjoyed by all.	2002-06-15

Were the ghosts real at the Haunting of Hill House or was it just Eleanor's descent into madness? This is up to the reader to decide upon this thrilling piece of psychological terror.  <br />The Haunting of Hill House does not describe the ghosts.  It does not throw the ghosts at the reader.  It only describes what the residents experience in the house: the noises, the turning of the door knob, the grasp of a clenched fist.  This book makes the reader use his or her imagination what terrible secrets lie within the house.  Are they ghosts?  <br />I read this book after I saw the first movie.  Do not see the second movie, please!  The first movie with Julie Harris is so much better than Lily Taylor was in the second movie.  (Lily Taylor is a great actress in her own right--but not in this movie).  The first movie, though, clearly captures the essence of the book.  But that is not to say the book is not good.  I found The Haunting of Hill House  to be one best examples of modern horror literature in that it can scare \\"bejeebers\\" out of the reader with its nuances of sounds and noises.  <br />Great reading, and beware if you read it late at night.	2002-06-15

Watership Down is one of those delightful books that I love to re-read when I little down--a little funky.

It is the story of Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the rest of their friends and family as they try to find a new living space in this sometimes cruel world.  They have their own bunny language, their own epic heroes, and their own lives which every reader can equate to his or her own self.  <br />I thought this is one of Adam's best works, and I found in it much suspense as the rabbits make their way across the English countryside with just enough pauses for me to catch my breath and continue on.

The world of romance was opened to me by this book, and I shall never forget it even though I have moved on to other types of books and away from romances per se.  <br />Besides being a romance, it is a mystery with a surprise ending, which lends itself to being compared to Jane Eyre and Rebecca.  This novel, though not a classic, is refreshing still in the 21st century.  <br />Martha Leigh has come to Mellyn to care for Connan Tremellyn's difficult daughter, Alvean.

I read it when it was published about 35 years ago--but then I was rather young at the time--so to speak.  <br />I thought it was one of the most wonderful books I had ever read, but then I was a young teenager.  The world of romance was opened to me by this book, and I shall never forget it even though I have moved on to other types of books and away from romances per se.  <br />Besides being a romance, it is a mystery with a surprise ending, which lends itself to being compared to Jane Eyre and Rebecca.  This novel, though not a classic, is refreshing still in the 21st century.  <br />Martha Leigh has come to Mellyn to care for Connan Tremellyn's difficult daughter, Alvean.  In the process of caring for her, Martha falls under the spell of the home, Mellyn and its many secrets--the main secret being was the former Mrs. Tremellyn murdered, and if so by whom.  As she searches for answers, she falls under Connan's spell while still frightened he may have murdered his wife.  <br />This books is still as delightful today as it was many years ago.	2002-06-04

Not being of the literary ilk, at first I found it rather hard to read. As I settled into it though, I found that I thoroughly enjoyed this wicked little tome about a murderous gourmet. It was delicious, adroit, delectable, and pretentious, but it certainly was not banal nor mundane. <br />Well, one of the reasons I really liked this book was its big words, and I was able to use my little grey cells.

I thought it had little characterization and had a poorly developed plot.  I wanted to yell, &quot;so what!&quot;  <br />But then!  I discovered it is not about the dreams of Annie and her life, it is about the life of Robert E. Lee and his dreams.  Re-reading it, I discovered that the characterization of him and those around him are fully fleshed out, the Civil War told in extreme accuracy.  This is what the book is about.  His dreams are tied into the present day dreams of Annie who is somewhat linked to Lee's daughter, Annie, and then the whole scenario is linked then Lincoln himself. Confusing?  Maybe, but good reading.  <br />Complicated time travel, if you want to call it that, but a pleasurable book and the ending gives it a really Twilight Zonish feel.	2002-05-29

With the Internet, it seems so easy to just get on the Web, push a few buttons, and presto you have a fantastic genealogy linked to every famous person in the world.  People!  This is not so!  Just because it is on a genealogy site on the internet does not prove it certain that you are related to that particular person.  Proof!  You need proof, the more the better.  Primary evidence is much more important than your secondary evidence.  <br />This book is an excellent source and guidebook to help you do just that.  <BR>You should and must document your sources in your family tree.  Too many people are just uploading their family tree willy nilly to net and everybody just takes it for granted that it is correct.  A good genealogist will at all times documents her or her sources for every (and I say every) bit information that is included in the family tree.  <br />Primary evidence is the best source: birth certificates, social security forms, etc.  Secondary evidence is good if it is backed up with other forms of proof.  <br />This book will help you find the best source and test that source against the information that you have.  Then it will show you how to include that information style in your family tree.  <br />Please cite your sources in your genealogy and family trees!  For the present and the future!	2002-05-22

They are both magnificent on their own terms.  Orson Welles captured it in a way we will never forget - but we should never forget the book from where it came.  Booth Tarkington created a book that could be read at any time anywhere.  What would it be like today with the advent of the computer age?  Who would be the riff raff?<br />This is more than a story about the oncoming Industrial Age, it is the story about the comeuppance of George Amberson Minafer or the story of the downfall of his family in an age that had no room for them.  <br />I had seen both movies - the Orson Welles masterpiece and the Arts and Entertainment version.  They are good, but one needs to read the book to get the full flavor of Booth Tarkington and then see the movies.  Read this book.  It is modern - even today.	2002-05-21

How would we react today if an outbreak of an uncurable sickness spreads like wildfire through out a city?  We almost had a taste of it with the anthrax scare after the 9/11 attack.  In Stewart O'Nan's novel, A Prayer for the Dying, the book shows what can happen when an outbreak is not stopped and how man reacts to it.  <br />Written in second person the narrator becomes the reader.  We are Jacob Hansen as he tries to save both his family, himself, and the city--but is unable to as the disease spreads and erupts through the countryside ending in widespread death, fire and destruction.  He (the reader) questions the disease and all that it conquers as if it were evil and the devil's work, questioning his own spirituality as to the \\"why is this all happening?\\"  <br />Did he have a hope, why was he the only one left, did he succumb to this creeping \\"evil?\\"<br />This novel is one of O'Nan's best works and is especially relevant today with the scare of anthrax and other germ warfare.  It makes the reader wonder - what? What would we do when something like happens?  A very formidable thought indeed.	2002-05-21

I will not give the ending away as some reviewers did, but you need to read this book to get the full flavor of the area and the era.  <br />How do these three characters intertwine with each other - both from the past and present?

But in the Appalachian series, she captures so much of the flavor of the area that they become books the reader cannot put down.  <br />She does not fail in this book.  She particularly has the skill of combining three stories together, whether one be in the past and one the future, and in the end all of them coming together, thereby always making a cohesive, dramatic ending.  <br />The present-day story in this book is about an upcoming electrocution of Fate Harkryder for murder.  The story of the future concerns Frankie Silver who brutally murdered her husband in 1832 (or did she?).  But wait, there is then a third murder in the book.  What do the three have in common?  That is the mystery in this book.  <br />As another review put it, this book all encompasses the story of the Celts versus the English - from the past down to even the present.  It still makes for good reading.	2002-05-19

It is the simple of a horse who lived through horrible times.  But this horse does not know why - because for the simple reason - he is just a horse.  <br />He tells (as only a horse can) of the Civil War (or is it the War of Aggression?).  He does not know.  He is a horse.  He does not understand why men are doing these horrible things to each other.  Why they are killing each other.  Why there is so pain and blood.  Why there is no food.  No water.  <BR>His only concern is his owner, the tall man in grey.  It is his duty to carry him safely everywhere and without fear.  Traveller does enjoy despite the hardship when he is allowed to parade with his rider in front of the many men who cheer - are they cheering him or his rider.  He wants to do a grand job whatever.  <br />It also tells of the horse and his owner - the bond they had for each other.  Traveller's wanting to do as good a job as he can for his owner because of this bond.  <br />I really enjoyed this book as it tells of the war without taking sides.  Of course, Traveller cannot take sides.  He is just a horse, therefore, he can tell of the war without being prejudice to either side.  Just the facts - all the blood, the gore and the questioning of why.<br />If you can get a copy of this book, read it.  It is a great novel.	2002-05-16

This tent was different, though, in a deadly way unknowing to the throngs of people jamming in to the see performance.  It had been \\"waterproofed\\" with a 6,000 gallons of white gasoline and 18,000 pounds of paraffin.  There were no laws about the use of gasoline and paraffin, and this was common practice of circuses at this time.  <br /> An accident occurred, a flame sparked, and within only a few minutes the entire tent was engulfed in flames trapping the hundreds of people there to see the circus.  At the end when the tent had completely burned to the ground, 167 people had either been burned horribly to death or trampled in the melee that ensued.  The clowns indeed cried that day.<br /> Stewart O'Nan brings this story vividly to life in his book The Circus Fire.  The main sentence that stands out in his narrative are the survivors saying they would never forget the sounds of the animals screaming in death.  But there were no animals, those were human screams.  <br /> This is one book I could not put down.  He writes in excruciating detail the pain and anguish the circus, town and people suffered after the devastation.  The book is hard to read at times but O'Nan just writes as it was, which was painful.  <br /> This book is an overwhelming piece of nonfiction, and I recommend it highly.	2002-05-10

In Gods and Generals, Michael Shaara explores the lives of Generals Lee, Hancock, Jackson and Chamberlain.  It delves into their thoughts, actions, remembrances leading up to the battle at Gettysburg.  He shows them as people not as unknown figures talked about in boring history classes.  People who had feelings, yearnings, and fear.  <br />One does not need to be a Civil War buff to thoroughly enjoy this book.  It could have been longer because so many battles are included, but then this may have made the book tedious to read.  <br />The movie comes out in 2003.  If it is as good as the book, it will be a winner.	2002-05-10

This book takes Sam Fowler from modern San Francisco back to the early days of baseball (post-Civil War) and the newly formed Cincinnati Red Stockings.  What makes this book so interesting is the description of how baseball was played in 1869 - so different than what it is today even as to the way pitchers pitched.<br />Sam Fowler begins riding the rails with the fledgling Cincinnati Red Stockings and their trip around the U.S. to play other early baseball teams.  It also goes into the atmosphere of the time, as in the description when the team played in New York City in a park that now is no more in these modern times.<br />Ah, but then it is also a love story.  But is it unrequited love?  Is it a lost love? And does Sam ever find her again?  <br />Great baseball book and would make a great movie also.	2002-03-27

Jonis Agee has captured the thrill of winning, but more often the frustration of not being to make it to the big one whether it be car failure, money, or skill.  But to these backyard racers, there is always the next one.  Maybe the car won't take the wall this time and the frustrated racer will finally win.<br />Racing is an obsession to them and because of it families will crumble and divorces will ensue.  But this does not deter the racer.  He will follow his dream to the end.  <br />Three paragraphs really jumped out at me while reading this book of short stories.  One in \\"The First Obligation\\":<br />\\"I mean a whole life can't come down to this collection of furniture and photographs, like a bunch of trophies you win in go-cart for just showing up--what kind of a race is that? I mean the sun's going down, my car engine's blown, and I can't even remember enough of my life to cry good tears over it.  I feel like I'm rolling loose, about to hit the wall again, and no one's looking anymore.\\"<br />And later<br />\\"A dream is something you die for,\\" she'd told him, and he'd looked at her, lying drained of blood as if her own dream and not his father's was the thing he should fear.  He'd understood then that she loved her husband, that his father hadn't forced her to what was her death bed, she had climbed into it herself.  They were lucky, these two people, his parents, he'd come to realize over the next few years.  Lucky because they';d been true to their dreams and because they knew what those dreams were.  Recognized them out of all the others that must have presented themselves like dancers at the dance.\\"  <br />and finally in the short story, \\"Mystery Numbers\\":<br />\\"Late summer when Dale Earnhardt had driven into the wall at the start of the Mountain Dew Southern 500, they said he experienced 'a transient alteration of his consciousness.'  Tom was thinking he needed one of those, but hoped it wouldn't take a smack in the wall to do it.\\"  <br />These men (and women) always hope that they will be one day up there with the Earnhardts, the LaBontes, the Martins.  That is not the main reason, though.  It is the car.  It is the love of the car and the need for speed.  And they keep trying.	2002-03-20

Long summer days, Roy Rogers, the polio scare, hideouts, and long-lost childhood friends.  <br />It is the story of Tab Rutland who lives in a small Alabama town in 1954.  The 1954 polio scare is on, and all of the swimming pools are closed in the town.  So with her new friend, Maudie (who is the daughter of the neighbor's African-American maid) they set about to build a fort in a kudzu vine thicket which they nickname Fort Polio.  They then begin a summer spying on the local moonshine maker, taking a fishing trip to get money for school supplies for Maudie, Tab's friendship with her neighbor's son, John (who is brilliant in his own right), in addition to other adventures.  Meanwhile, Tab's mother is blackballed by the venerable Ladies Help League and especially by the head of the League, Mrs. Grace Poovey.  <br />But the summer ends--and what happens to Mrs. Poovey?  And--what happens to Maudie and why does she have to leave town?  <br />This is a wonderful coming-of-age novel set in the 1950s and those have grown up in this time period will enjoy this book immensely.	2002-03-04

Upon completion, I found it to be one of the most remarkable books I have read in many years.  <br />Montana 1948 is the story of tragedy of a small-town family.  It tells of the fight for family loyalty  and/or justice proceeding to the consequences of such decision.  <br />David Hayden, the young protagonist in this novel, observes the struggle of his father who is the sheriff in their small town.  His father has to choose whether to arrest his brother who is the local doctor of rape or to overlook it because of the close family ties.  <br />It is told through the boy's eyes, but in telling it shows a simple picture of emotions of all the adults involved in this tragedy--the angst of father in making the decision, the downfall of his uncle who goes to extreme lengths to cover up the crime, and the starting truth finally told by the passive mother who only sees what she should see.  I was reminded a lot of the book To Kill a Mockingbird, but this book is a story in its own right.  <br />It is a simple story but it is complex in its own right.  I recommend it highly.	2002-03-04

It involves an eery atomosphere at a museum of Egyptology (a very popular subject in the 1920's and 1930's), a mysterious murder, and a complex plot on who did the murder and how.  The how being the most interesting in the book.  Was it a curse, or was just a complex murder?<br />As with the other Van Dine books, he throws in a lot information on the Egyptian art.

Van Dine after seeing the movie, Kennel Murder Mystery, with William Powell.  Philo Vance though is not William Powell.  <br />Philo Vance is an elitist, a snob of the first order.  He is erudite of all aspects of finer things, but he loves solving complex mysteries.  Readings these Van Dine books, one is taken back into the era of the 20's and 30's with all its art deco, martinis and affluent society--the Great Depression never being mentioned.  <br />In Dragon Pool, Sanford Montague (a very upper crust name) dives into his rather swimming pool known as the Dragon Pool because it is believed a dragon lives beneath its depths.  Montague comes up missing and later found drowned.  Was it the Dragon? Or was it one of his weekend guests.  That is for Philo Vance to discover.	2002-02-22

They are wonder old thirty-style of mysteries.  One of S.S. Van Dine's most famous mysteries in the Philo Vance series is The Kennel Murder Case from which the 1933 movie was made starring William Power as Philo Vance.  In the movie, it seems that William Powell is more like his Thin Man character of which he was to star later than the character Philo Vance.  Philo Vance is portrayed in all the books by Van Dine as a rather cynical upper-crust sort of fellow, lounging in the era of boot leg liquor and Art Deco.  <br />Van Dine tells the story in the book by portraying himself as a character who is a close friend to Vance.  Always being asked to help solve crimes by the New York police, Vance watches Van Dine  solve complex and interesting murder cases.<br />Van Dine always throws in numerous suspects.  In the Kennel Murder Case, Hilda Lake is angry that her uncle, Archer Coe, refuses to loan her any more money.  Coe's brother, Brisbane (very Art Deco name) hates his brother for unknown reasons.  Then there is Doris Delafield who throws him out of her apartment, and (instead of the butler), there is the Chinese cook who knows and resents that Archer is selling Chinese art treasures.  <br />Then Archer Coe is found dead holding a gun in his locked bedroom by the butler.  The police first report it as suicide, but then Philo Vance investigates and discovers it was a murder.  But who did it, and how did do they in a locked room with no evidence of escape? <br />There are more red herrings thrown in, more dead bodies.  But Philo Vance with his advanced wit and knowledge solves the case. <br />If you can get hold of these little gems, they are great reading.	2002-02-19

Though it is no Gettysburg, it is a wonderful book from an author who left us too early before we got a chance to know him.  <br />Billy Chapel is an aging major league baseball who once knew the pinnacle of greatness.  But age has taken over, and he is on the verge of being put out to pasture--or as rumors roam--being traded.  He is pitching his last game of the season, and as he pitches he ruminates over his life over a stream of conscienceless of thought.  He knows it is the end of his career, but he is not going without a flash and begins to pitch the best game of his life.  As he pitches, he begins to think back on his life, but as he does so he stays focus on the game--the perfect game.  Why?  For the love of the game.  <br />There are no simple answers to his life.  Nothing but memories, the future, and the love of the game.<br />A perfect little book from a great author.	2002-02-13

I enjoy Jill Churchill's books even though I have been able to guess the murderer in each, but this does not deter me from further reading.  <br />Jane and Shelly are best friends living next door to each other.  Jane (not unlikely for a cozy mystery) has a detective boyfriend named Mel.  So when a murder does happen, he is conveniently there to help her and her friend solve it.  <br />In this book, Jane and Shelly enroll in a gardening class, but the teacher has bludgeoned and lies in a coma.  A stuffy plant researcher takes over the class but instead of teaching the basics of gardening, he immediately delves into plant patents by showing off his pink marigolds.<br />The class itself is made up of an odd assortment of garden \\"lovers\\" who want to show off their particular gardens to the others--some of which are very good and some horrid.  <br />Then, the substitute lecturer is found dead in his own compost pile, and Jane and Shelly are off to find who in the class did him in.  <br />Mulch is an enjoyable and quick read with many humorous touches thrown in by the author.  Plan to read Jill Churchill's books if you want to be entertained, and you won't be disappointed.	2002-02-13

All I saw were errors that authors should never make (or should they?) when they write.  Errors like excessive points of view, passive voice and telling not showing.  This dissipated as I got more into the novel and &quot;went with the flow.&quot;  The &quot;errors&quot; were in fact part of the novel.  The author meant the novel to be this way,thereby making  it even harder to write.  It is one thing to try to avoid these mistakes, but it is another to use them deliberately--and use them well.  This she did exceptionally well.  <br />A Recipe for Bees is the story of Augusta Olsen in the autumn of her years.  The present only covers a short period of time, but the back story covers her whole life.  She reminisces through flash backs to her marriage to Karl and his obnoxious father.  Because of his father, Karl really cannot relate to her or to life in general until late in life--but thankfully not too late.  But to get this final stage of her life, Augusta had to live and she had to learn.<br />The story is interwoven with the history and practice of keeping bees.  The author deftly weaves these into the story making it part of the story.  Especially interesting is the swarm of bees that stayed in the barn until they were able to joined again at the hive.  Her life is like that swarm of bees.  <br />It is a light read and enjoyable read.  I recommend it highly.	2002-02-01

It was the language of the book--the metaphors, the plays on words--the style of the story that Elizabeth Hay set on paper that held my attention. <br />A Student of Weather is the story of two sisters in love with the same man.  It is the story of Norman Joyce and her unrequited love for Dove, the student of weather.  It is the story of how she tries to gain his love and the tragic aftermath of it.  It is the story of betrayal to her sister, the lovely Lucinda.  Lucinda, the sweet one, but was she?<br />To me, though, the book is mainly about the language.  Ms. Hay can make the drab look beautiful.

Boone's Lick did not reach the status of Lonesome Dove, but on its own it was a very good and well-written book.  He shared a great tale of the Old West with me.<br />The book is about the trip of the Cecil family as they travel from Boone's Lick, Missouri to the West.  Mary Margaret, the mother and matriarch of the family, wants to get a divorce from her wandering husband and she aims to get it even if it means packing up and traveling all those miles.  In the meantime, it tells of the story of the United States in the post-civil war era--the lack of meat, Indian massacres, renegades--everything to make this tale a hum dinger and hold your attention.  He also tells his tale while winking at you at the same time.  The asides, the Mark Twain-type wry pundits makes this book very hard to put down.  <br />Even though it started out slowly, it turned into a quick read.  Mainly, because after a while, I could not put it down.	2002-01-25

Unfortunately, I found that her earlier work does not compare to the work that she produces today.<br />MacPherson's Lament is a continuation of the series about forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson and the travails of her southern family.  This book concerns her brother, Bill, who unwittingly sets himself up for charges of fraud when he sells an antebellum mansion for a group of Southern ladies to a Yankee fortune hunter.  He finds out later that the house really belongs to the State of Virginia--his clients disappearing to parts unknown.  <br />Elizabeth helps him out of this predicament in addition to helping his law partner, A. Powell Hill, with a murder case she is trying in court.<br />One review says that the book would lead to \\"a Civil War secret that may be the key to the ugly truth....\\"  I did not find one at all, just a series of misunderstandings and disappointment.<br />For those who like them, this would make a very enjoyable cozy mystery read.  I was expecting more, though, and like one reviewer I really saw no mystery in the book.  But, I still like Sharyn McCrumb's work and plan to read the further adventures of Elizabeth MacPherson.	2002-01-24

I got hooked on Changing Rooms from the beginning when Direct TV first put BBCA on our system.  <br />I believe this British (the original) show is so much better than the American version of the show, Trading Spaces.  I believe it is because the designers are so much daring in their creations and are not as bland (and I really mean bland) as the American counterpart. <br />But being an American, I don't know if I could do a complete make over from Changing Rooms, but the ideas that Linda Barker gives are so inspirational so hopefully it will me to break out of my own &quot;bland&quot; mold.  I could maybe let Laurence redo a room and not cry when I see it.  <br />Handy Andy, where are you, my house needs fixing?	2002-01-24

She keeps getting better - now with the third installment of the Harry Potter series.  The book opens when Harry Potter has to spend another disastrous summer vacation with the Dursleys.  But--it ends happily enough for him when he causes his Aunt Marge to inflate like a gigantic balloon and float away.  Because magic is not allowed, Harry runs away only to be rescued and whisked off to the Leaky Cauldron inn.  <br />As this is happening, there is the news that convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and is now on the loose, and Harry finds out accidentally that Sirious Black is on the lookout for him.  Sirius Black wants to kill him!  Harry now must find out why and finds ways to save himself from Sirius Black and also from the dementors who are hired to \\"protect' him.  <br />One of the things I enjoy most about J.K. Rowling's books are the numerous red herrings she throws in the plot.  Just when you think you have figured out \\"who done it,\\" some new clue or herring has been thrown in to upset the apple cart.  But then because there are so many red herrings, she does take up too much time at the end of the book tying up all the loose ends.<br />One little nit I did not like, was the author's use of some words that some parents might find objectionable.  But like I said, it's just a nit.  <br />Get it for your child, get them to read!	2002-01-21

I was not disappointed.  Una, the protaganist, seems doomed from the beginning of the story--from the secret way her parents died, to her grandfather, Rawney, and his dubious friends who are somehow (or are they?) connected to the I.R.A.  In fact, all of Una's life is somehow always connected to the I.R.A. and not because she chose that way.  <br />The crux of the book was when she met Aiden, who seemed the perfect man - but then was he the perfect man?  Even to the end, she still could not grasp any other image of him.  This was her tragic flaw.  <br />I recommend the book to all even though there were some &quot;Irish&quot; stereotypes.	2002-01-18

But then reality hits you in the face, and you find that they are &quot;real&quot; men, the kind you meet every day.  The only thing I did not care for in Ms. Houston's book was the fact that all her men were losers.  Hey, there are a few good apples are there!  You just got to keep looking.  <br />But, she did tie in the effect of co-dependency and a person's selection of a partner, and this can tie into a man - or a woman.<br />I really enjoyed this book and recommend it highly.	2002-01-08

I read it and enjoyed it so much, I bought the other books in the series.  <br />The author presents Tori as a spunky - no quirky - (are these words used too much? - not in this case) - heroine, star, and detective in a delightful New England cozy.  <br />In addition to the mystery, several recipes for the sticky buns are given which did not help my diet at all.  <br />For anyone who wants to stay in bed on a rainy day with a good murder mystery/cozy, I much recommend this book.  Very tasteful and fattening.	2001-11-24

Tasty bits of gossip.  It was as if I were listening at a door to &quot;wicked yet tasteful&quot; descriptions of supposed published authors--who should be not published.  <br />In addition, the author gave great examples of story starts, and by reading them, I could dream up other story starts on my own.<br />This is a great book if you are stuck in your writing, plus it is a good read on its own.	2001-11-24

The author effectively blended a murder mystery along with great moments of comedy ranging from Duck the duck, the old lady playing croquet on the table, to the loud and raucous peacocks.  The author placed in the book several red herrings throwing the reader off side but surprising them at the end.  <br />The only thing I didn't really care for was the cavalier attitude of everyone after the murder--someone got murder but ON with the weddings.  But all in all, I am looking forward to her other books.	2001-11-20

Someone broke into the car and tried to steal the radio but was not able to--but they did get away with this audio tape.  Now, I know there is a car thief somewhere in this area listening to Pride and Prejudice, and I hope they enjoy it.<br />I compare this book with a comfort food.  For me, it is a comfort book.  When I have nothing else to read (seldom) and don't want to read any more murder mysteries or genre fiction, I reach for this book as it always brings me joy and pleasure.	2001-11-20

The Corrected Text	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Do Not Be Afraid to Read Faulkner	Having read the other reviews, I found I made a big mistake - Absalom Absalom was the first William Faulkner book I had read.  <br />But--I prepared thoroughly for my reading of this classic by studying a brief outline of the book but excluding that information would give away any of the intricate threads that Faulkner wove throughout the book.  Then, while reading I imagined either Shelby Foote or the woman who narrated To Kill a Mockingbird with their southern accent reading the novel to me.  Doing this, I was able to have a mind set for the stream of conscienceness in which Faulkner wrote.  <br />By doing all this, I enjoyed this book immensely.  It is a tightly woven fable of the rise and fall of a demon-man, his children, and the betrayal of the family along with the rise and fall of the Southern plantation system.  It also is a better novel than the early Uncle Tom's Cabin in it's denunciation of slavery.	2001-10-24

But then this is another day, another time.  It's prose that hit the nail on the head in those turbulent times before the Civil War.  Harriet Beecher Stowe had a cause to write about and wrote a work that still stands the test of time.	2001-09-24

It was not because of the development and furtherance of the Bible story, but I got tired of reading about a woman's time of the month, birthing, adventures with sheep, and jerky men.  If the author had taken the story and made it into an allegory or a separate story, but her re-writing of Bible bothered, plus the fact that she made so feminist.  Nothing against feminism, but one must take into context the time when this story happened and not compare it to today's standards.  There were bad times back then, but there were good times also.   Basically, though, I just lost interest in this book.	2001-09-06

She has the ability to make the reader feel as if they were in the shoes of the Appalachian people even giving them lessons, as in how to pronounce the word, &quot;Appalachian&quot; correctly. I liked the story of the history of the song better than Lark's story. Lark was written as more of a shallow person than those left up on the mountains, but maybe Ms. McCrumb meant to do this. Also, the LeDonne chapters could have been incorporated into other parts of the book than being in separate chapters--leaving the reader to wonder, &quot;why tell the story of this person, if only to tell of the old wrecked plane.&quot;<BR>I hope Ms. McCrumb writes more of the Ballad series. She has a permanent fan here.	2001-08-30

Early in the series, I really enjoyed the Hamish MacBeth novels, but now they seem to have become &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; books with the same tired plots. She uses short, choppy sentences and seems to do more telling than showing in her books now. This has become very tedious and does not keep this reader's interest as much as it did in the past when the books were very good reading. Also, does she have to describe in each and every book every little detail about all the characters in the village -- which is almost the same information verbatim taken from the last book and the book before? Ms. Beaton also needs a new editor, especially in this book where Fergus was substituted for Angus (in a death scene) making it very hard for the reader to know just exactly what is going on and who exactly was murdered. Also, Ms. Beaton - give Hamish a life! He is still pining away for his lost lady love. It's just the &quot;same ole, same ole.&quot;	2001-08-21

This has got to be the stupidest book I have ever ordered, and now it is definitely going in my re-sale bag.  <br />I wanted a book to help me find ways to clean my house--useful ways.  I did not expect a book that would try make me aware of my inner beauty through housework.  Phooey! Inner beauty is not having to do housework.  And what does S&amp;M and pornography have to do with cleaning your house?<br />The practice exercises were even worse.  As in preparing altars in your sanctuary.
