These are the stories of an men fighting the Germans in Greece at the start of WWII, of a sailor trying to get gold to the daughter of a dead man, of miners, of men on the edge of hungry in San Pedro, of the survivors from a ship sinking who last long enough at sea to be rescued, of incidents in Shanghai, and other stories.   <br /> <br />There is a richness in these stories from what life was like for average people a hundred years ago.  It was a hard life.  Louis L'Amour could tell these stories because he had lived through similar experiences.   <br /> <br />This was a hard book to put down.  Louis L'Amour has always been one of my favorite authors.  If you like real life adventures from a time long ago, this is a good book to read.  If you've enjoyed any of Louis L'Amour's stories, give this book a try. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-12

(Go to Google and do a search on \\"Isabel Lyman Homeschool revolution\\" without the quotes.)  It is a fun blog with lots of homeschooling posts.  It was a treat to finally get around to reading her book, \\"The Homeschooling Revolution.\\" <br /> <br />There are a lot of homeschooling books that talk about what is homeschooling, why do people homeschool, and how to homeschool.  They tend to be good size books and can be a bit intimidating.  Isabel Lyman's book is focused on \\"What is homeschooling?\\" and a little of \\"Why do people homeschool?\\"  As such this book is direct and to the point.  This is the perfect book for people who just want to know more about homeschooling. <br /> <br />The book starts off by introducing us to a few families who homeschool and briefly gives us some reasons why they homeschool.  There is a short history of homeschooling over the last forty years.  The book talks about some of the changes in the law, and how it is now legal to homeschool in all 50 states.  Then the big question of socialization is addressed.  (Every homeschooler must get that question at least once a month.)  In the section about academics it was fun to read about how homeschoolers as a small percentage of the US are dominating such things as the National Spelling Bee.  The book explores some of the ways homeschoolers are marketing the movement to get the word out.  I was a bit surprised to find that in general the print media is current fairly positive towards homeschoolers.  This is helped by how broken the public schools have become.  In one of the last chapters the book explores some of the internal conflicts in the homeschooling movement.  The book also summarizes some surveys about homeschoolers to present some profiles about who is homeschooling. <br /> <br />This was a fun book to read.  Isabel Lyman writes well.  It is a pretty quick book to read, the main part of the book is only 126 pages.  If you are interested in learning more about homeschooling, or have a friend who is interested in understanding homeschooling better, this is a good book to buy. <br /> <br />	2005-08-10

In the future mankind has expanded out to the stars, they have colonized many planets, and they meet the zor.  The zor is an alien race with wings.  They have a long history of developing powers of the mind.  Those with strong mental powers are called sensitives. <br /> <br />The first book, \\"The Dark Wing,\\" told the story of how a war between humans and zor ended.  We had hints that another alien race was trying to get the humans to destroy the zor.  Our heroes are able to work out a peace.  The second book, \\"The Dark Path,\\" sets the stage for the next struggle with a new alien race.  In the second book we meet Jackie Kearny who is put on a quest for a special zor sword, the gyaryu.   <br /> <br />In some ways these books feel like \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  There is a quest for a special item which provides great power.  There is a struggle between good and evil, and the struggle occurs on several levels.  There are many, many characters, and lots happens.   <br /> <br />In \\"The Dark Ascent\\" Jackie gets the special sword.  The new alien race, the vuhl, is able to take over both human and zor minds.  In the first part of the book the vuhl takes several key systems from the human empire.  Jackie, and others, work to find ways to protect themselves from the vuhl. <br /> <br />There was heavy emphasis on mystical events.  The story often bounces between what is happening in the \\"real world\\" and what is happening in a spirit world, and what happened in myth.  Often the main characters were portrayed as having little control over their lives, and they were often manipulated.  I like my science fiction to be more about the heroes making good choices in hard situations, rather than being tricked because the \\"zor's god\\" wanted certain things to happen.   <br /> <br />Walter Hunt is still a relatively new Science Fiction writer.  He has only written the three books.  He writes well.  The book moves along well.  All in all it is a pleasant story.  If another book is written in this series I'll probably read it.  If you like mystical science fiction, gives this book a try. <br /> <br />	2005-08-09

Humans were not the first intelligent life to develop in our Solar system.  James P. Hogan's earlier books explore in detail how a taller life form developed on Minerva.  They call themselves the Thuriens.  Minerva later became our asteroid belt.  The Thuriens left our Solar system 25 million years ago.  Humans developed on Minerva, and after a deadly war which destroyed Minerva a remnant of humanity migrated to Earth.  In these books we find that part of the reason humans have been so warlike is another branch of humanity, the Jewlense, have been manipulating the people on Earth to start wars.  Things work out.   <br /> <br />The first four books are nicely summarized in the prologue, the first seven pages of \\"Mission to Minerva.\\"   <br /> <br />In the first chapter Victor Hunt, one of the main characters from the previous books, gets a phone call from himself from another universe, a parallel or alternate universe.  The first half of the book recounts the efforts of humans and thuriens to develop the technology to go to other universes.  This was fun and pleasant. <br /> <br />The second half of the book is about a trip back in time to try and save the humans on Minerva from blowing themselves up.  There was a little more tension in this part of the story. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint with the story is that right after developing the technology to go back in time to other universes they mount an expedition to do so.  It would seem that after figuring out how to do so, they could have spent some more time mastering the technology before they rushed off to Minerva.  Since they can go back in time, they could have waited another five years, or even fifty years.  They would have been better prepared and had more technology.  Because they rushed off to Minerva there was much greater tension in the story, but I felt the tension was artificially created. <br /> <br />All in all it was a fun read.  Ifyou've read the other stories in the series, and enjoyed them, this should be a fun read. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-02

Rowling has done an amazing job of building a fascinating world of magic.  The Harry Potter books have become one of the most popular series of all times.  These books follow the life of Harry Potter, as he finds out he is a wizard and is accepted to Hogwarts, a school to teach him how to use magic.  His greatest struggle is having to deal with \\"He who must not be named\\" a wizard who killed Harry's parents, and tried to kill Harry. <br /> <br />\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is the sixth book in this series.  Harry is now in his sixth year at Hogwarts.  Harry is learning more about magic.  As important, Dumbledore (the Headmaster of Hogwarts) works with Harry to learn more about the life of Lord Voldemort, the wizard who killed Harry's parents. <br /> <br />The war between Lord Voldemort, who is leading evil wizards, and the good wizards is escalating as more muggles (those without magic) and those in the magic community are being killed by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.  This is largely the backdrop to Harry's life at Hogwarts.  We follow his struggles with his classes, a late developing romance, and other events. <br /> <br />This is a fun book to read.  I read it in one seating, finishing it at 2:20 AM in the morning.  It is well written.  Unfortunately J. K. Rowling has scattered lots of clues, and it isn't clear just what they all mean.  I am sure she has done this purposely, so we have some ideas about the final book, but aren't sure just what will happen. <br /> <br />If you have enjoyed the previous Harry Potter books, then read this book.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-30

I tracked down the book and read it.  I am glad I did.  This book is the result of years of research into the history of business.  One of the key questions the authors focus on is: \\"What makes a business profitable?\\"  They came to the conclusion that companies which develop new markets can basically print money for the first five to ten years.   <br /> <br />A \\"Blue Ocean\\" represents an uncontested market, a product or service that only one company is selling.  The authors show that historically this has been the most profitable situation to be in, as opposed to a market with lots of competitors, or a \\"Red Ocean.\\"  The authors found that most of the tools for developing strategies in business are focused on \\"Red Oceans.\\"  The authors found that most \\"Red Ocean\\" strategies take the current industry's structural conditions as a given.  A \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" sees market boundaries and industry structures as flexible.  This book was written to help people find new markets, analyze if the new market could be profitable, and then develops strategies for fully exploiting the new market. <br /> <br />One of the key tools for finding new markets is what the authors call a \\"Strategy Canvas.\\"  The idea is to pick a set of key factors that current markets focus on, then on a scale from low to high put a point for where a market is for each factor, and then draw a line for a market.  By looking at where there are no lines you may get some ideas for new markets.   <br /> <br />Once a new market is identified the authors help analyze if there is potential for making money.  They have a set of ideas on how to look beyond the existing demand, more importantly they provide some tools and processes for the analysis just how big a new market might be. <br /> <br />And once the decision is made to move into a new market, the authors have ideas on how to organize the business.  They made the point that there is often a lot of reluctance to make changes and provide some ideas on how to get employees on board. <br /> <br />In many ways developing a new market, or a \\"Blue Ocean,\\" is a lot of work.  And in the past it has been very risky.  By using the ideas from \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" businesses will have a better chance of finding and developing profitable new markets.  It will be interesting to see if there is a new emphasis by businesses to more systematically look for new markets, and where that leads us.   <br /> <br />This is going to be a classic.  It is very readable, and worth rereading.  The key insights and principles in the book are well explained, and supported by lots of examples.  People will be reading it for the next twenty or more years.  If you enjoy books about business, read this book.  If you are looking for ways to expand or develop your business, read this book. <br /> <br />	2005-07-21

Over 200 million copies of his novels were published.  He mostly wrote about how the poor lived back between the 1860 to the start of the 1900s.  He perfected the classic rag to riches story.  Typically there was a young man down on his luck, who through luck and pluck was able to meet many challenges and end up triumphant in the end. <br /> <br />\\"A Rolling Stone\\" is about a young man, Wren Winter, who came down from Maine to make his fortune in New York City, and to see the world.  By having Wren move around Horatio Alger is able to show us many different parts of America.  We see many parts of New York City, then Wren travels on a boat up a cannel in New York, he goes out to the Midwest, and to California.  All along the way he has adventures.   <br /> <br />It is amazing how stories Horatio Alger wrote for children back in the late 1800s are now stored in the adult section of the library.

Val ends up being cared for by Will Reilly who is a gambler and travels a lot.  The first quarter of the book is about adventures that Will and Val have.  They have to deal with outlaws, they fight off Indians, and they travel to Europe.  All along the way Will is constantly teaching Val important lessons of life.  Will starts teaching Val, at four years old, how to shuffle cards.  Val is encouraged to study men and observe what is happening.  It seems like on almost every page Will teaches Val about something, how to fight, how to think, how to be kind to people, but also the need to be careful about trusting people. <br /> <br />Unfortunately Will is ambushed by three men and killed while Val is still a teenager.  But Val has learned many important lessons from Will.  The next part of the book is about Val growing up.  He has some money and is able to invest the money in a couple ventures.  He has some adventures along the way.  Val kills one of Will's murderers.  He goes back East to get an education. <br /> <br />The story then jumps forward a couple years, and the last part of the book pulls together many of the threads.  Val finally meets his mother, who is again trying to have him killed.  Val kills the last two of Will's murderers.  And Val financially destroys the man who hired the murderers.   <br /> <br />This book has some many of the classic western themes, like gambling, fighting, love, and so on.  There is lots of different types of fighting, for example with knifes, with fists, and with guns.  There is both a tragic love interest, and a successful love interest.   <br /> <br />One of the reasons this is such a powerful story is it is a story about Will's legacy.  Up until Val, Will had just been drifting through life, but after raising Val for ten years, Will has made a difference.  Will's contributions to the world last beyond his death.   <br /> <br />This is one of Louis L'Amour's best.  If you like a good western, this is good one to start with. <br /> <br />	2005-07-05

I had heard this book was about a new revolutionary idea, that we could all have the same level of production that big factories had, but we could have them in our garage.  This sounded like a cool idea. <br /> <br />Unfortunately this book doesn't do a great job of presenting the idea.  The idea may be true, but this book wanders around from topic to topic.  On page 56 the author says the book can be several things, advice for new business development, help for policy makers, and provide direction for technologists.  This lack of focus dilutes the message of the book.  Unfortunately the book only provides a few basic ideas and doesn't explore in depth the implications. <br /> <br />There were a number of errors in recounting history.  For example on page 82 the author implies that the British were still conducting slave trade at the turn of the 20th century.  I also found it disturbing that the author felt it was reasonable that silk weavers destroyed the looms that were taking away their jobs.  So if some new technology threatens ones livelihood, it is OK to break and burn.  With this attitude we never would have adopted the plow.   <br /> <br />The central argument of the book seems a bit weak to me.  As the power to produce becomes cheaper, I am sure there will be some changes in our society.  But just because someone can have the power to produce a car in their garage doesn't mean very many people will produce their own car.  The economics of personal production were not effectively address.  We've had the personal production capabilities for building our own clothes for decades, but very few people use sewing machines to create their own clothes.   <br /> <br />On the plus side the book does read quickly.  There are some interesting ideas.  If the idea of personal fabrication sounds interesting, read the first 17 pages.     <br /> <br />	2005-07-01

One of mine said, 'Oh, you go to public school?  Well, we're sure your mother loves you anyway, and she'd homeschool you if she could.'\\"  <br /> <br />The humorous story helps set the stage.  The author deeply cares about homeschooling.  In chapter one the author introduces herself, explains how she came to homeschool her three children, and tells a bit about what her children are doing now.  The author is clearly qualified to help beginners learn how to homeschool. <br /> <br />This is a good book for parents new to homeschooling.  It is packed with information.  It is not a quick read, but it is very worthwhile.  I couldn't think of a single facet of homeschooling that this book missed.  It explains how to deal with people who don't support the decision to homeschool.  It covers different types of homeschooling.  It walks the reader through the basic steps of building a lesson plan.  Specific issues on math, reading, history, science, and writing are addressed.  There are a lot of good suggestions on how to organize your homeschool and how to set it up.  And for all of these areas there are pointers to other resources, books, web sites, and so on.   <br /> <br />One of my favorite chapters was the one on \\"The Good Stuff Most People Won't Tell You.\\"  There is a list of the positive benefits of homeschool, things like having a flexible schedule and being able to go on vacation whenever you want.  The chapter points out that in teaching your children you will get smarter.  The last chapter of the book focuses on the benefits to the family of homeschooling.  The children will be closer to each other and to their parents, because they have spent so much time together. <br />  <br />One of the main purposes of this book is to reassure the reader that he or she is able to homeschool.  The author is very supportive, explaining that while homeschooling is a daunting task and takes effort, it is possible and most parents can homeschool their children. <br /> <br />If you are thinking about homeschooling, this is a great book to read.  (This is also a good book to give to a friend who is thinking about homeschooling.)  It will help reassure you that you can homeschool, and it provides guidance on how to get started, and how to homeschool. <br /> <br />	2005-06-25

He was born in 1832 and died in 1899.  Over 250 million copies of his books were published.  Horatio lived in poor parts of New York City and thus was able to write in detail about how the poor lived.  His Rags-To-Riches stories excited the imaginations of the youth of the day.  It is sad to see that books written for teenagers over a hundred years ago are now stored in the adult section of the library.  The vocabulary is much richer than youth books being published today.  When looking for Alger stories always try to get an unabridged version.<br /><br />But be warned, some of the Horatio Alger stories are not as good as this one.  For example \\"A Rolling Stone\\" is very racist.<br /><br />The hero in the \\"The Erie Train Boy\\" is Fred Fenton, a hard working 17 year old boy.  We first meet him on a train where he sells travelers food, magazines, and books.  He is struggling to provide for his widowed mother and his younger brother.  Early in the story they almost get kicked out of their apartment because they don't have enough money to pay the rent.  It is such a contrast to see how times have changed.  For example their rent back then was $10 a month, and they had very few possessions.<br /><br />Fred has a number of adventures in New York City.  He also does some traveling, first going over to Niagara Falls, and then later up into Canada.  At Niagara Falls Fred is suspected of being a thief, but is able to prove his innocence and help find the real crock.  Later in the story he ends up working for a wealthy man and is entrusted with a mission to go into Canada to recover some stolen bonds.<br /><br />This is a fun book.  It is very well written.  My children kept asking me to read the book.  If you want an entertaining story about life in America over a hundred years ago, this is a great book to buy.	2005-06-21

So recently I reread it and enjoyed it.<br /><br />Meg's father has been missing for over a year.  Meg, her brother Charles, and Calvin, a neighbor boy, go on an adventure to try and rescue Meg & Charles' father.  The are aided by three strange women who have magical powers and take them to several planets along the way.  Meg's father has been captured by a great evil.  The great evil then captures Charles.  Meg and Calvin are left alone, and then Meg is alone.<br /><br />It is a fun, entertaining story.  I read it all in one sitting.  If you like fantasy then give this story a try, you'll enjoy it.	2005-06-21

In \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\" James Surowiecki does a good job of explaining how groups of people may make better decisions than the experts.  Marc Stiegler in \\"Earthweb\\" writes a wonderful story about humans defending their planet against doomsday machines from space, called Shivas.  One of the most important tools is the Earthweb which allows everyone on earth to help in fighting the doomsday machines. <br /> <br />This is a well written book.  It was hard to put down.  We are introduced to a variety of interesting characters and the story weaves their lives together as it builds to the exciting conclusion.   <br /> <br />The book explores the events leading up to the second attempt to destroy another Shivas.  We meet the attack team which is going onto the most recent Shivas.  An important character is Morgan MacBride who directs the team remotely.  He was the leader of the team that destroyed the first Shiva.  The rest of characters are mostly those who kibitz via the Earthweb to help the attack team blow up the Shiva. <br /> <br />The basic premise, that of these Shivas coming every five years and they can only be destroyed by sneaking on board, is a bit farfetched.  But it does provide the author with a way to explore the power of the wisdom of crowds.  One of the interesting things to me is this book was published in 1999, and \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\" was published five years later in 2004.   <br /> <br />	2005-06-18

This is largely because of what is written on page 5:<br /><br />\\"If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.  As it stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves.\\"<br /><br />This book was written in response to direction from the United States Secretary of Education in 1981.  One of the main purposes was to access the current state of education in America.  Many feared that education was in bad shape, and the Secretary of Education wanted a complete and through investigation.  A commission of people involved with education met together, reviewed various reports, held hearings, and then they reported on their findings.  This book is their report.<br /><br />It is a short book; the report is 85 pages and then there are 30 pages of appendices.  The most interesting stuff is in chapters 2, and 5 to 7.<br /><br />The first chapter briefly covers the commission's charter, to investigate the state of education in 1981, and to makes suggestions.<br /><br />Chapter two is the hard hitting summary of how broken things are in education.  This chapter has the above quote.  It had a number of scary points.  It also had this famous paragraph (page 13):<br /><br />\\"Each generation of Americans has outstripped its parents in education, in literacy, and in economic attainment.  For the first time in the history of our country, the educational skills of one generation will not surpass, will not equal, will not even approach, those of their parents.\\"<br /><br />Chapter three is pretty boring.  It has a list of reports the commission looked at, with a summary for each report.  Most of this chapter was Report A studied elementary education.  Report B reviewed studies on high school issues.  Report C is the results of surveys of students.  I'm glad the commission looked at all these reports, but it wasn't all that helpful to read now.<br /><br />Chapter four is similar, it is a review of all the hearings they had.  The hearings were held around the United States, and each hearing had a different focus.<br /><br />Chapter five reports their findings.  And yes, to no ones surprise, education in the early 1980s had lots of problems and issues.  The findings are grouped into: content, expectations, time, and teaching.<br /><br />Chapter six has the recommendations.  This is very useful to anyone involved in education today.  It is interesting to realize that many of the recommendations were tried, but yet education in America still has lots of problems today.<br /><br />Chapter seven is a plea for action.<br /><br />If you are interested in education, this is a good book to read.  It is sobering to see that things haven't gotten better.  In understanding the state of education now, it is good to see what the state of education was 21 years ago.	2005-06-18

I read a couple chapters and found them well written and fun.   <br /> <br />Amazon's guidelines ask that URLs not be included in a review, but if you'd like to read about Lawrence's efforts to publish online, go into goggle, search for \\"The Spriggan Mirror\\" and you find the web page. <br /> <br />I decided to start at the beginning of the series with \\"The Misenchanted Sword.\\"  The main character is Valder, a scout for the Esthshar army.  They have been fighting the Northern Empire for decades.  Valder ends up behind enemy lines and runs for his life.  He accidentally stumbles into a hermit wizard who has been hiding out from civilization for years and doesn't take kindly to Valder who, even accidentally, brings the war to where the wizard has been living.  The wizard decides to turn Valder's sword into a magic sword which will protect Valder and help him to return to the Esthshar army.  With all the spells the wizard puts on the sword, it does help Valder to get back to the Esthshar army.   <br /> <br />The Esthshar wizards study the sword and find there is a slight problem with the sword, that after Valder kills 100 warriors with it, the sword will kill Valder, the sword was misenchanted.  Valder and his sword are used to fight the Northern Empire.  Then later in the book Valder tries to figure out what to do with this misenchanted sword. <br /> <br />This is a pleasant story.  It read well and it is hard to point down.  While writing this review I've picked up the book a couple times to reread some favorite passages.  If you like fantasy, this is a fun book to read. <br />	2005-06-16

We started with the first book.  We'll take turns reading a page.  My daughter likes to keep reading.  She doesn't want to stop.  These books are well written for young children learning to read.  They have plots appropriate for young children.   <br /> <br />In \\"Mummies in the Morning\\" the heroes, Jack and Annie, travel back to the time of pyramids.  They have an adventure where they help the ghost of a dead princess.  Like all the books in the series, Jack uses a book to help them out of problems.  (I wonder if the author is trying to send the message to children that books have answers to problems.) <br /> <br />Like the other Magic Tree house books, this book moves along fairly quickly, interesting things happen, and children learn a bit about ancient Egypt.   <br /> <br />If you have young children, this is a good book to read to them, or read with them. <br /> <br />	2005-06-16
US	38267055	R2N9ZKG3B87NGQ	0789732777	883993570	Absolute Beginner's Guide to Home Schooling	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A good starting point for learning about homeschooling	<br />This is a good starting point for someone interested in homeschooling.  It covers many of the reasons for homeschooling, walks the reader though the steps on how to find out what they have to do legally to homeschool, explains how to organize to do an effective job of homeschooling, shows how to manage a homeschool, and includes a list of resources to help the reader find other useful books and places to improve their homeschool. <br /> <br />For the last couple decades public schools have gotten worse and worse.  \\"A Nation at Risk,\\" which was published in 1984, made public the growing concern about the decline of public education.  Thomas Sowell's \\"Inside American Education\\" explores some of the reasons for the decline.  Diane Ravitch's \\"Left Back: A Century of Battles of School Reform\\" puts the decline in a historical perspective.  So one of the main reasons for the dramatic growth of homeschooling is the recognition that in many cases public schools are not teaching children how to read, write, or do arithmetic.  A large percentage of children are dropping out of high school and another large percentage graduate, but are functionally illiterate. <br /> <br />Over the last thirty years the homeschooling movement has grown to encompass every facet of society in the United States.  It has been growing around 7% to 10% a year.  Initially the homeschooling movement started with a couple small groups of people, largely hippies and Christians.  Both of these groups were very distrustful of public schools and the effects government controlled public schools were having on their children.  Now there are black homeschoolers, pagan homeschoolers, unschoolers, and so on.    <br />Brad Miser's book does a good job of addressing many of the basics of homeschooling.  His main focus is on those who chose to have a structured homeschooling experience.  As such he doesn't address homeschoolers who are not structured and let the children make decisions about what they (the children) want to learn.  For me the biggest weakness of the book was not exploring the full range of options for parents who are thinking about homeschooling. <br /> <br />In the chapter on socialization there are many good reasons to keep children out of public schools as it explores the positive types of socialization homeschoolers can have, and the negative types of socialization children are forced into in the public schools.  Most homeschooled children have a wider range of friends, than children in public schools who only hang out with children their own age.   <br /> <br />There are several chapters on how to prepare to homeschool.  One whole chapter covers why it is important to network, and ways to find other homeschoolers.  There is a chapter on how to plan out a school year and where get the resources.   <br /> <br />There are several chapters on how to manage a homeschool.  The author talks about how to have very structured classes.  He encourages parents to have a lot of documentation on what the children are doing.  I liked the chapter on taking field trips.  There was a good chapter on how to evaluate the progress of your children. <br /> <br />This is a good book to start with for anyone who is interested in homeschooling.  It is easy to read, well organized, and entertaining.  I liked the frequent quotes placed through out the book.  The author clearly believes in homeschooling, he and his wife do homeschool, so he is passionate and knowledgeable about homeschooling.  If you are considering homeschooling, or want some help in getting started, this is a good resource to have. <br /> <br />	2005-06-15

Our daughters have listened to the \\"Story of the World\\" CDs again and again.  My oldest daughter on her own will pick up the first three books to read.  So when Peace Hill Press sent out an email saying a few advanced copies were available, I quickly ordered a copy.  When it arrived I had to take turns with my oldest daughter as we both wanted to read it. <br /> <br />In many ways this is a good conclusion to the series.  It is a bigger book than the previous ones.  Susan Wise Bauer says in the forward that Story of the World Volume 1 was written for children in grades 1 to 4, volume 2 was written for children in grades 2 to 5, volume 3 was written for children in grades 3 to 6, and volume 4 was targeted at children in grades 4 to 8.  So this last book is written for a much higher level than the first book. <br /> <br />Be warned, in many ways this is a sad book, it focuses mainly on the wars, revolutions, and civil strife over the last 150 years.  This is probably its biggest weakness.  The book makes little mention of positive things that have happened over the last 150 years.  Most of the discussions of changes in technology, business, or other areas of life have to do with how the changes affected war. <br /> <br />It was sad to see some basic patterns.  Again and again some leader, or group of leaders, would try to gain power or expand power, there would be a lot of fighting, many people would die, and often things wouldn't fundamentally change.   <br /> <br />The book is very comprehensive.  It covers every part of the world.  I learned a lot about South America and Africa.  I had not realized that it was only in the 1870s that Europe carved up Africa.   <br /> <br />This is a good conclusion to the series.  It is well written.  It was hard to put down.  If you have read the first three volumes then you should buy this book.  If not, you might want to start with the first volume. <br />	2005-06-09

The author spent 30 years at Hallmark, the greeting card company.  He was very involved in a number of creative teams.  The author wants us to step back and look for new ways to do everything. <br /> <br />The title of the book is based on an analogy of how most companies are like giant hairballs.  Every time there is a new rule, another process, or one more form to file out, it is like adding one more hair to a hairball.  At some point the hairball itself is what is important.  Like a planet, hairballs have attraction and can suck employees in.  Companies expect everyone to follow the rules, but this will destroy the creative process.  The author explains that there is a balance to staying near the giant hairball, but not being swallowed up by the hairball, or orbiting the hairball.  By orbiting a hairball we can draw strength and resources from the hairball, but we still have the freedom to be creative.  The author says most people are swallowed up in the hairball and we'll have to work to get into orbit.  He gives some suggestions on how to do this. <br /> <br />There are a lot of fun chapters with good messages.  My favorite chapter was chapter 19, the only words were: \\"Orville Wright did not have a pilot's license.\\"   <br /> <br />The book is unusual in how it is laid out.  There are little pictures mixed in with the text.  The text gets bigger and smaller and twists and turns.  There are a number of styles in how the book is structured.  This adds to the basic message of being creative. <br /> <br />There are a lot of good points in this book.  The book is well worth reading.  If you are a logical, analytical person, you may be put off by the book, but stick with it.  The book is a quick read, and a fun book to read. <br />	2005-06-07

Christopher Anvil (Harry Crosby) has always been one of my favorite authors.  So I am slightly biased about this book.  But in all honesty, this is a good collection of fun stories.   <br /> <br />There are 23 stories in this book; the stories are in four groups.  These stories were originally published from 1958 to 1978.  All but \\"Warlord's World\\" were published in various Science Fiction magazines.  \\"Warlord's World\\" was previously published as a complete book.   <br /> <br />The first group of stories, which makes up about half the book, is about the Interstellar Patrol.  These stories are a direct continuation to \\"Interstellar Patrol\\" which was published last year.  Roberts and his friends have to solve a number of impossible problems, problems that would overwhelm mere mortals.  In one story \\"Riddle Me This ...\\" they have to go into an alien fort to rescue two comrades who are being tortured to death.  In another story \\"The Throne and the Usurper\\" Roberts goes solo against a man with a very amazing mutant ability. <br /> <br />The second group of stories has the least connected set of stories; this is kind of the grab bag set of stories.  Two of the stories have to do with colonies of particular branches of humanity fighting off nasty alien invasions.   <br /> <br />The third group of stories are about problems a couple crews have in shipping freight between the stars.  The first story is about how to handle a new crew member who is a big trouble maker.  There are two stories about how to handle difficult cargo.  Another story is about potential death during shore leave. <br /> <br />The last group of stories focuses on the struggles of colonists on very hostile worlds.  \\"Leverage\\" is one of my all time favorite Anvil stories.  It is about how the colonists learn to use the deadly fauna to work for them, instead of killing them. <br /> <br />If you have ever enjoyed a Christopher Anvil story, buy this book.  These are entertaining stories.  The book is hard to put down.  If you haven't read any of Christopher Anvil's stories, this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-02

The book starts off with Okinawa in which the author lost an uncle.  This provides a very personal touch as the author explains his efforts to find out more information about his Uncle.     <br /> <br />In discussing all three battles the author covers some of the obvious consequences, like the lost of loved ones and how that affected families back home.  He reviews some of the changes to military strategy after each battle and changes in politics.  He also shows that there are many less obvious consequences to each battle.   <br /> <br /> <br />Okinawa:  <br /> <br />In Okinawa, near the end of World War II, the Americans launched an invasion that was bigger than Normandy.  The Americans saw it as a stepping stone to the invasion of the Japanese islands.  The Japanese wanted to make the battle so bloody that they thought the Americans would decide Japan would be too hard and ask for peace.  The Japanese lied to the civilians on Okinawa.  The civilians were told that Americans would rape the women and kill the children.  Many of the civilians helped in the defense of the island.  The Japanese would do almost anything to kill an American solider.  After awhile the marines decided that the Japanese didn't value their own lives.   <br /> <br />The author traces the decision to use the Atomic bombs to the horrendous loses at Okinawa.  Up until Okinawa the plan had been to use Okinawa as a base for close to 10,000 bombers to soften up the islands, followed by large invasion.  After realizing just how expensive a normal invasion would be, the atomic bomb was more seriously considered. <br /> <br /> <br />Shiloh: <br /> <br />The battle of Shiloh was the first battle in the United States Civil War to have a huge body count.  Thousands on both sides were killed.  The South was able to launch a surprise attack, which after the first day seem to indicate that they were winning the battle.  The North was able to rally and drive the South away. <br /> <br />There were a lot of interesting consequences from this battle.  This is where both Grant and Sherman had their baptism of fire; they became well known and were given larger commands.  Johnston, who had lead the South, died on the first day.  And for decades afterwards many in the South believed that if he had lived, they wouldn't have lost the Civil War.  Because of the chaos of war, another Union solider, Lew Wallace, became disgraced.  He spent the next forty years trying to get redemption.  And in part this is what leads him to write \\"Ben-Hur.\\"  Colonel Forrest, on the Confederate side, gained great recognition because of his successful daring actions.  He was given a much larger command and was very effective.  He was very capable and ruthless.  After the Civil War he was asked to lead the KKK, and because of his fame, he was able to get large numbers of people to join the KKK.   <br /> <br /> <br />Delium: <br /> <br />The Battle of Delium was fought between Athens and the Boeotians in 424 B.C.  Athens was badly defeated.   <br /> <br />Being so long ago there is less known about what happened, and all of the consequences from this battle, nevertheless, the author is able to show some key results of this battle.  One of the Athenians, Alcibiades, gained great fame from this battle, and because of the fame he was able to rise in power, but eventually he helped destroy Athens.  Some of the first real uses of tactics were used in this battle.  Up until this battle, most battles were two armies just rushing at each other.  Socrates was also at Delium.  Much of the contribution Socrates made to Western thought happened after this battle.   <br /> <br /> <br />Consequences in General: <br /> <br />The last chapter of the book explores why some battles seem to have more of an effect.  Some of the factors are timing, the number of dead, how important they are in an overall war, how well publicized the battle was, and other factors.  The author notes that the effects of 911, the Terrorist attack on the United States, are still happening. <br /> <br /> <br />This is a good book for anyone interested in Military History.  The author writes very well.  He knows his military history.  The book is easy to read and hard to put down.  There are a lot of interesting ideas and observations.  This book is well worth reading. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

They'll listen to the same stories again and again. There is a basic pattern or template that the stories fit into.  Jack and Annie, a brother and sister, go into a tree house that is near home.  In the tree house they'll find a note left by Morgan giving them an assignment.  They'll travel some where in history, have an adventure, do their assignment, and return home.  One of the things I like about the books is we do learn a little history while reading the story. <br /> <br />I read \\"Tonight On The Titanic\\" with my middle daughter.  We took turns, each reading a page.  I enjoyed the book.  Jack and Annie are asked to get a gift from a ship lost at sea, the gift will help break a magic spell.  Jack and Annie end up on the Titanic.  They try to encourage people to hurry and get off the Titanic.  They have some success and get a gift from one of the people they save.  It was fun to read. <br /> <br />Personally I'd probably give this four stars, but because my daughters like the Magic Tree House books so much, and they are target audience, it deserves a five.  If you have young children this is a good book to read to them, or read with them.	2005-05-28

Dally Rumpe placed them all under spells.  Through the first four books, \\"The Everyday Witch,\\" \\"The Witches of Friar's Lantern,\\" \\"The Witches of Sea-Dragon Bay,\\" and \\"The Witches of Winged-Horse Mountain\\" Beatrice and her friends were able to break the spells on each of the four daughters.  \\"The Witches of Bailiwick\\" is the final conclusion.  Here Beatrice and her friends storm the castle to try and save Bromwich Bailiwick. <br /> <br />The fifth book does follow the basic formula of Beatrice living in our world, meeting with the Witch's Executive Committee, going to the Witch's Sphere, and having some great adventures.  Sandra Forrester does a good job of painting an interesting world of magic and fantasy.   <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the first four books, you'll enjoy this one.  If you haven't read the first four, you should start with \\"The Everyday Witch\\" before reading this book. <br /> <br />	2005-05-28

It starts off with a cutesy fable about how education become so broken, and then how things got (hopefully will get) better.  The book is very serious about the many problems our children are facing in public schools. <br /> <br />LouAnne Johnson explores some ideas on how she would solve the problems of education.  She talks about what she would do if she could be the queen of education and just pass edicts.  The first chapter goes over her edicts.  Her edicts tend to be superficial.  I almost didn't go pass the first chapter because I kept making notes about some possible unintended consequences of her edicts.   <br /> <br />Her first edict is \\"No classroom in this country shall have more than twenty students.\\"  She goes on to say \\"Period. We have spoken.\\"  Does this mean all bands and sports teams have to be 20 or less?  Why can't a high school history class have 100 students who listen to a lecture and then break into discussion groups?  For young children, small classrooms make sense.  For well behaved high school students, there is less value.  Sometimes students do best when there are two teachers in a slightly larger classroom.  But her edict won't allow any flexibility. <br /> <br />Her second and third have to do with forcing politicians to teach in public schools for a couple weeks, and then forcing them to send their own children to the worse public schools.  Ha!  This would never happen.  It is like wishing for a billion dollars.  It sounds like a nice idea, but it is never going to happen.  And forcing politicians to send their children to bad public schools shouldn't happen.  Everyone should be able to chose if they want to send their children to a private school, or even homeschool them.  Currently one of the largest groups of people to send their children to private schools is public school teachers.  In some cities over 30% of public school teachers send their children to private schools.  Shouldn't they also be forced to send their children to public schools? <br /> <br />The edict I made the most number of notes on was her forth which reads: \\"Begin to deflate the bureaucratic bloat in our public school system this very instant.\\"  The huge bureaucratic mess of public education is one of the major causes of problems in education.  So this is a good issue to focus on, but then her approach is bizarre.  She would send the head of every education hierarchy home for a week.  If things don't fall apart, he gets fired.  Then she continues down to the next level to try again.  So a manager who has done a good job of picking good people for his organization will be able to let them runs things for awhile without any direction from him.  But a bad manager may create an organization which can not function without him, for example if he micromanages or doesn't even allow others do to some key processes.  So the result of this fourth edict might be to get rid of the good leaders and retain the poor leaders. <br /> <br />The Sixth Edict said that money saved (in some situations) was to go directly \\"to student libraries, incandescent lighting for classrooms, and fine arts programs.\\"  My first thought was why incandescent lighting?  What about the electrical work?  What about the plumbing?  Why specifically incandescent lighting.  (If you read chapter 9, you'll find out.)  One of the major problems with public education today is having inflexible rules, but the author doesn't learn from this.  She repeats this fundamental problem in a number of her edicts. <br /> <br />After reading the first chapter I would have given this book one or two stars. <br /> <br />I am glad I got pass the first chapter, because the book got better.  She gives some history about her life, how she got into teaching, and some of the experiences she had being a teacher.  This was very well written, and enjoyable. <br /> <br />This is an OK book to read, but you need to be careful.  LouAnne Johnson clearly cares about education.  She has had many painful experiences in teaching.  But some of her solutions would not fix education.  At best they might solve one problem and create other problems. <br /> <br />	2005-05-26

Over the last couple decades more and more children no longer have a parent to greet them at the door when school is over.  This is largely driven by the mother going into the workforce, and to some extent by the huge increase in divorce.  Children are now being raised by daycare centers, by the schools, and sometimes they are raising themselves.  The author covers in detail many of the problems that have resulted from these changes. <br /> <br />There is no easy way to summarize all the types of problems explored in the book.  I'll just mention of few of them.  The author shows how many daycare centers are germ factories, for children are much more likely to catch a disease in a daycare center.  The less time a parent spends with a young child, the more likely the young child will become violent.  There has been a huge increase in the percentage of children who are fat and truly obese.  Historically parents controlled how much children got to eat, but now often children get to decide.  There are a lot more mental health problems now, versus a couple decades ago.  Teachers and daycare centers are turning to drugs to medicate children for what had been considered normal juvenile behavior.  Many of these drugs haven't been fully tested.  It was fascinating to read about how much of the popular teenage music now is a cry for parents to be parents.  Five of the top ten most frequently reported diseases in 1995 were STDs.  Most children having sex are having sex in an unsupervised home.  This is just a small sample of the dozens of problems children in America are now facing. <br /> <br />If you have children, this is a good book to read.  It will help you understand the true costs and potential dangers your children may be exposed to if you try to outsource the raising of your children. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-19

Often by aggregating the decisions of many individuals the errors will cancel out and you are left with a very good decision.  Another point is that for complex problems there is no \\"expert\\" who completely and thoroughly understands the problem, and can thus give the \\"right\\" answer.  Most big problems are solved by making our best guesses and then seeing if our decisions were right or good enough.  A group of people, because together they have more information, can make better choices. <br /> <br />James Surowiecki uses a variety of interesting examples to discuss how much better decisions a group can make.  His first example is how Francis Galton found that an average group of people at a county faire in England back one hundred years ago were able to guess the weight of an ox within a pound, much closer than any of the \\"experts\\" were able to get.  It was fascinating to learn that within hours of the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion the stock market picked which company was responsible, by a big drop in the stock price, long before there was any clear understanding of what had happened.  And within a couple weeks the international health community was able work together to understand SARS, without any guiding hand or one organization in charge. <br /> <br />The author also explores under what conditions a group of people might make a poor decision.  He found that a group of experts, who all tend to have a similar viewpoint on a particular topic, may make a worse decision than a group with a few \\"less smart\\" people who will see a problem from different view points.  Another situation that happens is where there is a vague problem for which people don't see a clear answer so if someone will go public with his answer, then other people will go along with the first answer, rather than making their best guess.  He calls this information cascade.  It is better that everyone be encouraged to make their best guess, and then work through a process of resolving or aggregating the decisions. <br /> <br />The chapter on how to pick good solutions for issues raised by new technology was fascinating.  The author compared the process of how the free market finds good solutions to how a beehive looks for food.  One example was the early development of the automobile.  In both cases scouts go out looking for solutions (honey or car designs) and bring them back to be evaluated by the group.  The market reviewed hundreds of designs for cars and gave feedback on which designs were better.  The basic design quickly developed.  It is key to have a system which generates lots of alternatives and allows losers to be abandoned quickly.  It is important to have both diversity of solutions and diversity of perspectives to generate better results. <br /> <br />Some books are interesting and educational, but after reading them there is little need to go back and reread them.  You can learn the basic lessons in one reading.  \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\" is one of those which needs to be reread every so often because there are so many interesting ideas explained and thoughts explored.  It is well written and is worth the time to read and worth thinking about after reading.   <br />	2005-02-16

The life and hard times of Little Orphan Annie, 1935-1945	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Better than the musical	I recently saw a performance of \\"Little Orphan Annie.\\"  I got to wondering about the comic strip.  This book has selections from the comic strip from 1935 to 1945.  The book is a brick; it is about five pounds.  The pages are not numbered, but there are easily 500 pages here.  You can read six strips at a time, three on the left, and three on the right.  The date for each strip is right above the strip. <br /> <br />It is easy to see why the strip was so popular.  This was a hard book to put down.  The stories are fun and entertaining.  You do have to ignore many unlikely events. <br /> <br />The book shows an interesting contrast between how there have been some great changes over the last seventy years, and how many things are still the same.   <br /> <br />For example in one of the threads there is a discussion of how Warbucks might be developing atomic energy.  There is another story of Nazis taking over a castle in the United States.  Often Annie is in trouble and it is hard to get to a phone.  From incidents like this you can see some of the changes over the last seventy years.  Nowadays with so many people having cell phones, Annie would have been able to avoid lots of problems with a quick phone call. <br /> <br />Then on the flip side so many of the problems Annie dealt with are motivated by common themes through all of literature, greed, jealousy, malice, and so on.  Annie often has to endure some terrible situation, but always in the end things work out. <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because this book has selections from the ten year period, and huge chunks are missing.  Most of the time it isn't that noticeable, but ever once in awhile a story would start to wrap up, and then the book would jump to strips published a couple months later without a complete conclusion.  I would rather have had a book with the complete selection of five years, than to have a partial selection over a ten year period. <br /> <br />All in all this is a fun book.  If you are looking for some hours of entertainment, and you are interested in knowing more about Little Orphan Annie, this is a good book to read. <br /> <br />	2004-12-28

In surveying over 60 urban schools, the author found that there is a pattern of school boards hiring new school superintendents, who comes in with great promise and lots of new ideas.  There are lots of changes for a couple years, but there is no dramatic improvement, so the current school superintendent gets fired because things are still bad.  Then a new superintendent comes in, again promising to fix things by implementing a lot of changes.  The net result is no reform last long enough to truly fix any problems.  The school district keeps lurching in different directions every couple years, never making any real progress. <br /> <br />As I read this book I thought of: <br /> <br />------------- <br />\\"We trained hard, but it seemed every time we were beginning to form up into teams, we would be reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing, and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization\\" <br /> <br />From Petronii Arbitri Satyricon AD 66. <br />Attributed to Gaius Petronus <br /> <br />Gaius Petronus, a Roman General, later committed suicide <br />------------- <br /> <br />A pattern on constant reform is not new.  Frederick Hess analyses the environment that produces this pattern in the school environment.  He finds that in general members of the school board want to be re-elected.  Many are using the office of school board as a stepping stone to other elected political offices.  In general school boards which fight with each other don't get re-elected, so they are motivated to find issues they can agree on, and reform is an issue for which most board members see a need.  So when there is a problem in the school district, they don't hire a new school superintendent who comes in promising to continue the reforms of the previous superintendent, they hire someone with fresh new ideas.  The result is the old reforms which may have just started producing fruit are ignored and teachers are told to try some new methods.  The result is things are not improving in the urban schools. <br /> <br />The author makes the point that schools deal with two very important subjects, children and money.  People are concerned that both are taken care of well.  Unfortunately there are no simple objective measures to see how well a school is doing.  This is partly the result of there being no clear, agreed upon, purpose to education.  Some want children taught academic subjects, some want children to learn to be good citizens, some want children to be taught to take care of the earth, and so on.  All of this means that people care very much about schools, but people can't tell how well a school is doing.  So appearances become very important.  Both the school board and the superintendent are strongly influenced to put on a good front. <br /> <br />This idea of appearances being very important is explored in great depth in the book.  And other related ideas are mentioned on why there is such a dizzying rate of reform efforts in urban schools.   <br /> <br />The book is well written.  It is well structured.  The author has done his research.  It is interesting to read, though often painful to learn how bad things are.  If you are looking for a better understanding of one of the key problems with public schools, this book is very worth reading. <br /> <br />	2004-12-18

II: Eminent Historians Imagine What Might Have Been	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Some thoughtful analysis of possible alternate histories	<br />Alternate histories are a staple of fiction, especially in science fiction.  Most of these have a back ground common to our history, and then turn at a single point, for example President Lincoln isn't assassinated.  This approach provides an easy way for the author to have a setting the reader is familiar with, but then allow the author make up a story.  Alternate histories are very popular and can be very entertaining. <br /> <br />\\"What If? 2\\" tries to tie into this market.  The book has a number of chapters, most of which are short historical articles on why each of several key events had a great impact on our society.  Most of these are interesting and some are even fascinating, but they aren't really entertaining.   <br /> <br />If you are interested in pure entertainment, then this book isn't for you.  If you are interested in some thoughtful discussion about key points in history, then this book is worth reading. <br /> <br />	2004-12-09

It explores the connection between the teacher unions and efforts to improve education.  In all the talk about problems in American Education there have been a wide variety of assertions and opinions about the role and affect of the teacher unions on improving education.  The book explores the connection in depth. <br /> <br />There are nine chapters, each written by a different author, or set of authors, which explore different issues.   <br /> <br />A couple of chapters address how unions bargain and the affect on public schools.  The chapter on collective bargaining in the Milwaukee Public Schools had an interesting point about how teachers really have two sets of pay raises.  Contractually teachers get automatic pay raises for their years of service and professional degrees.  So a teacher with a Masters degree who has worked five years will get a specific automatic pay raise when starting to work the sixth year.  And then every so often the teacher unions will threaten a strike and say the teachers need a pay raise, and then a new contract is generated.  The public is only aware of this second set of pay raises. <br /> <br />The other chapters look at a variety of issues.  One chapter explores what might result from efforts by the teacher unions to gain control of professional licensing at a national level.  Currently professional licensing is handled by state government.  The conclusion is there would be no improvement in the quality of teaching.  There was a chapter on the NEA and school choice, which said that though much of the NEA is against school choice, there are some people within the NEA which tolerate or even support school choice.  Chapter 6 explored what happened when governors in Michigan and Pennsylvania worked to curtail the power of the unions in public schools.  The next chapter looked at some of the research the unions have done on education.  Chapter 8 explored what affect teacher unions in other countrieshave on reform.  And the last chapter focused on if unions could be a positive influence on education reform.  <br /> <br />One of the surprising conclusions was that teacher unions don't really improve or degrade education.  The various studies mentioned in the book do find that as a rule teacher unions end up increasing the costs of public education.  But the book says that the teacher unions don't really affect quality in a positive or negative way.  This seems to ignore the issue of when the cost for education increases with no improvement in performance, that this is really negative on education overall.   <br /> <br />Fundamentally teacher unions are about helping the teachers, not the students.  Teacher unions want to increase the salaries of teachers, make sure they have benefits, and improve working conditions.  They may give lip service to worrying about the students, but there is no real incentive for them to improve the quality of education. <br /> <br />If you are interested in education and the affect teacher unions have on education, this is a book worth reading. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-08

The author of \\"A Sense of Self\\" Susannah Sheffer was reading some of the literature and noticed a comment about how all of the girls in these studies were in the public school system.  Susannah Sheffer has long been involved in homeschooling and wondered if the same types of problems were happening with girls who were being homeschooled.  She was thinking outside of the box.  So Susannah interviewed fifty-five homeschooled girls.  She used many of the same questions in the original studies.  \\"A Sense of Self\\" is the result of her study. <br /> <br />Susannah Sheffer found that homeschooled girls had a stronger sense of self-esteem, a stronger voice, and were much more comfortable with who they were.  She found that these girls had a great sense of freedom, they felt safe, and valued themselves.   <br /> <br />The author explores an idea that part of the problem for girls in public schools is they are encouraged to be passive and accept whatever the teachers and other public school employees tell them to do.  In many ways homeschooling is an act of rebellion, parents are standing up to the social norms and saying they will be different.  So homeschooled girls see this pattern of standing up for what they belief is best and right.  Whereas in public schools, girls are taught what the teachers feel is best.  Girls learn to go along with the group of children.   <br /> <br />Susannah Sheffer explores some ideas on how the public school system could provide a better environment, which would nurture girls so they could retain their sense of self. <br /> <br />This was a fascinating book.  It is well written, and has a number of interesting ideas and comments.  If you are concerned with the struggles girls go through, this is worth reading. <br /> <br />	2004-11-10

There are several groups in the book looking for 300 pounds of gold.  The hero, Nolan Sackett, gets caught up in the race when he tries to help a stranded group.   <br /> <br />The book starts off with Nolan on the run, he beat a man to the draw, and the man's friends come after Nolan intending to kill him.  Nolan has a run in with another man when Nolan needs a fresh horse.  A few pages later Nolan comes to help a group, and the group tries to kill him.  And the story never slows down.   <br /> <br />This is a fairly typical Louis L'Amour, a very well written story.  It is a page turner, and is hard to put down.  If you enjoy a good western, pick this book up; it is worth reading. <br />	2004-11-03

The author points out that most everyone agrees that the public school system is not performing well and it is very, very broken.  Sheldon Richman argues that people who try to fix the public school system by keeping it as a government school system are doomed to fail. <br /> <br />For me one of the most fascinating parts of the book was when the author took a step back in time and reviewed the bloody history of the middle ages when government and religion were intertwined, and war after war was fought \\"to save souls.\\"  A fundamental problem was that by having a state religion, people felt justified in trying to force other people to believe a certain way.  Naturally the minority groups opposed supporting the state religion and being forced to support repugnant beliefs.  Sheldon Richman says one of the great breakthroughs in civilization was the separation of church and state.  As long as people behaved in a reasonable way, they could believe whatever they wanted to believe.  The author makes the analogy that one of the main problems with public (government) schools is that once again the state is forcing people (children) to believe certain beliefs.  And sometimes these beliefs are repugnant to the students and the parents. <br /> <br />The author reviewed a number of other problems with the public school system.  For example he pointed out that school bureaucracies are not flexible and have little incentive to improve.  Another point was public school systems are a one size fits all, which is not good for most children.   <br /> <br />The author briefly covers the history of education in America.  He provides some of the main arguments other people have put forth against government supported schools.  He explores some ideas of how people could get an education without government schools, and how competition might provide some interesting options. <br /> <br />This is a very thoughtful book.  There are a number of good insights about the problems of public education.  If you are interested in the fundamental question of should government be involved in education, this is a good book to read. <br />	2004-11-02

She had read and reread the book several times over the three weeks.  I was curious and so I read it.      The story is about a young witch, Beatrice Bailey, who lives in our world.  When she turns twelve she is given a quest to rescue some relatives who have been placed under a spell by an evil witch.  This book, the first, is about Beatrice's venture into the world of magic and with the help of some friends tries to break part of the spell.      There have been some comparisons between these books and the Harry Potter books.  The Beatrice Bailey stories have some of the same richness of a detailed world of magic.  So far the world is lighter that the Harry Potter world.  Beatrice grew up knowing that she was a witch, and she comes from a healthy family that loves her.      If you enjoy, or your children enjoy, light fantasy, then this is a good book to get.  It reads well.  The book has a well fleshed out magical world that entertains and enthralls.	2004-10-28

Most of the rest of his stories focus on a few characters that are rarely mentioned again in his books.  \\"The Rider of Lost Creek\\" is an exception; this is the first of three books about Lance Kilkenny, one of the fastest gunfighters in the west.  Kilkenny tries to stay out of sight and out of trouble, but when a friend of his gets into trouble, Kilkenny comes to straighten things out.   <br /> <br />I once heard that Louis L'Amour kept two typewriters in his office.  When he hit writer's block on one story, he would switch to the second typewriter.  I wonder if this happened on this story because one of the secondary characters, Steve Lord, at the start of the story seems like a good guy, but later he turns out to be a bad guy. <br /> <br />I am often amazed at just how well Louis L'Amour's wrote.  For example in chapter 7, to give us some background of Rusty Gates, one of the good guys, there is a paragraph that starts:  <br /> <br />\\"His mother had died when he was sixteen, working to make ends meet.  A year later, Rusty had lost a sister to the cholera, and one brother was killed by a bad horse.  Another brother, at fourteen went to work on a riverboat, and his sister, at sixteen, married a doctor in Joplin.  At sixteen, Rusty road away west to find what fortune might offer.  He wanted land of his own, a few head of horses and cattle.\\" <br /> <br />In just a few sentences Louis L'Amour reminds us just how hard life was a150 years ago, he shows us how alone Rusty is, and he lets us know that Rusty is the kind of guy who is trying to build civilization.  It is well done. <br /> <br />The basic plot of the \\"The Rider of Lost Creek\\" is Kilkenny's friend, Mort Davis, is in trouble, two bigger cattle ranches look to be getting ready to wipe him out.  Kilkenny shows up on the scene and realizes that there is more going on that meets the eye.  This is more of your typical western movie; Kilkenny leaves thegirl and rides off into the sunset.   <br /> <br />This is a fun story, one of Louis L'Amour's best.  If you enjoy a good western, this is a good one to read. <br /> <br />	2004-10-18

Our leaders are supposed to represent us; they get voted out of office when they don't.  \\"Betrayal\\" documents how there is little accountability in American labor unions today.  This book shows how a big part of the problem is legally unions don't have to report how the labor leader spend the union dues, so often union members no clue as to how the dues are being spent.  In many ways the union leaders are like kings; there is no accountability and they get to do most anything they want, while claiming to look out for the rights of the union members. <br /> <br />This was a very informative book.  For example recently the NEA has more paid political operatives, 1800 operatives, than the national Republican and Democratic committees combined.  Another interesting thing was the change of the character of labor unions.  Back in the 1950's about 35% of the American labor force was unionized, but now only 8.2% of the private-sector employees are unionized.  In the 1950s only 5% of union members worked for the government, and now it is about 46%.  Original labor unions claimed to protect the rights of those on the lowest rung of the labor force.  Now labor unions are more and more focused on middle classs government employees. <br /> <br />A major theme of the book is just how closely the unions are working with the Democratic Party.  The authors make the contrast that any money from a businessman is a voluntary donation, while labor leaders extract dues from union members and spend the money on causes that often the rank and file are opposed to and object to.  One survey found that 80% of union members are opposed having money taken out of their paychecks and spent on politics. <br /> <br />There are many interesting observations and information about how unions work today, and the problems caused by unions.  One chapter covers how public employee unions have put the public in danger covered several examples; one was when prison workers went strike and allowed 200 prisoners to escape, putting the public at great risk.  Another chapter focused on the NEA & AFT and how they are concerned about protecting their power, and have done little to improve education in America.  There was a chapter on how many unions have ties with organized crime, for because unions have to report very little, organized crime is attracted to trying to take over unions. <br /> <br />Starting with the title it is clear the authors are concerned with how unions abuse their power.  The authors do a good job of showing why the reader should also be concerned.  If you have any interested in the state of unions in America, and their influence in politics, this is a worthwhile book to read.  <br />	2004-10-14

This book has an exhaustive review of how the public school system is failing the needs of gifted children.  I found it very informative and well written.  I had not realized just how many problems gifted children struggle with in schools.  The book document dozens, maybe even hundreds, of problems gifted children have to deal with in the public schools. <br /> <br />The Davidsons started up a software company, sold it, and now use their money to help talented and gifted children.  They have a nonprofit organization, which coordinates their efforts.  They frequently mention their web site: [...] <br /> <br />With the \\"No Child Left Behind\\" law there has been a huge push to make sure that the slower children get extra attention.  According to the book close to 20% of the education budget for elementary and secondary schools is targeted for the bottom 10%, while less than 1% is targeted for the top 10%. <br /> <br />About a quarter of the book is stories of talented individuals.  Some children learned to read at ages three or four, and by first grade were reading at college level, yet the schools forced the children to move along with everyone else.  Others were playing complex classical music at seven, yet at school they would be forced to day after day do simple beats on a drum.  One common theme was just how bored most gifted children are in school.  The schools are wasting their time.  Most of these stories were painful to read.  Many gifted children are really suffering in schools today.  They become depressed, they become disruptive, and suffer in other ways.  They are like young thoroughbreds ready to run races, but forced to shuffle along with a bunch of turtles. <br /> <br />The authors make the point that most gifted children in the public schools are underachievers; they are no where close to reaching their potential. <br /> <br />Another interesting point, the authors make is that most schools will spend a lot of money ontheir talented athletes, but many people seem to feel it is bad to put an focus on meeting the needs of the intellectually talented. <br /> <br />The authors cover a number of ways we can improve the situation.  There are suggestions for parents, suggestions for teachers, suggestions for politicians, and so on.  I was surprised to learn that half of the families the authors work with homeschool their children. <br /> <br />If you have gifted children, or if you teach gifted children, this is a good book to read.  It is a quick read.  There are many good suggestions on how we can better meet the needs of talented and gifted children. <br /> <br />	2004-10-07

The author does a good job of leading the reader through some history of war focusing on the role of the catapult.  He points out that historically there have been three types of military units, the hard hitting infantry, the fast moving cavalry, and then the artillery.  I liked his description of the catapult: catapults make something big go whoosh and then splat.   <br /> <br />The basic approach of the book is to cover the usages of catapults through the ages, and then show how to make a model the given type of catapult.  It was interesting and informative to see the different types of catapults: <br /> <br />1) Tension - basically a big bow and big arrows <br />2) Torsion - using rows to provide the tension <br />3) Traction - using lots of people to pull on ropes <br />4) Gravity - using heavy objects, like lots of rocks <br /> <br />The book has a nice layout.  The pictures and diagrams are good.

Several testing experts contributed a variety of chapters about types of testing, when should testing be used, how far to trust testing, and so on.  The chapters are well researched and well documented.  There are over 25 pages of footnotes. <br /> <br />One of the interesting points made in the book is about how it is reasonable for the public and the government to expect to be able to make informed decisions about education.  Too often educators seem to feel taxpayers should just give schools money and then let the educators decided how to spend the money.  No one would ever expect this for most services.  You don't hop in a cab and ask the taxi driver where he wants to take you.  You don't go to a doctor and ask where he would like to operate.  And so it is very reasonable for taxpayers to want to know if the money is being spent well.  The authors of this book explore how testing can be a good way to see if the American people are getting enough value for their money. <br /> <br />Richard Phelps explores why so many testing \\"experts\\" hate testing.  He points out that well designed multiple-choice tests can quickly and cheaply give a good assessment of how students are doing in mastering a subject.  Badly designed multiple-choice tests should be tossed out, but not multiple-choice tests in general.  A well designed multiple-choice test can require higher-order thinking. <br /> <br />There was a good chapter on how testing can help catch students who are having problems reading.  There was another chapter about some strengths and weaknesses of some science tests.  There was a fascinating chapter about videos of Japanese teachers teaching math.  Another chapter was on the problems with portfolio assessment, for example one problem is how it is so subjective.  Every teacher has their own evaluation, and it is hard to compare students.   <br /> <br />The last section of the book was on accountability.  One chapter was on the problems with how Kentucky has implemented their programs.  The last chapter was about the strengths of how Texas has implemented accountability. <br /> <br />If you are interested in testing and education, this is a good book to check out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-25

Every page has a ton of information and action.  Tom Clancy has done his research.   <br /> <br />The basic story is what might happen during World War III.  The story is told from several points of view, so we get to see what is happening on the ground through the eyes a tank commander.  We get to see parts of the naval battles through the captain of a ship.  In the depths of the sea we see sub fights.  In the outback in Iceland we watch one of our heroes hide out from the Russians, and provide headquarters with intelligence about what is going on in Iceland.

If they agree, then it is a great book, and they give four or five stars.  And reviewers who don't agree with the main themes of a book will often give the book one or two stars. <br /> <br />\\"The Many Faces of John Kerry\\" goes over the last thirty five years of John Kerry's political life in an effort to show why John Kerry would be a bad president.  This is the goal of the book.  So people who distrust John Kerry will enjoy the book.  They'll agree with the main points.  People who like and admire John Kerry will think this is a stupid book.   <br /> <br />My review of this book is going to try to focus on the presentation of the material, how well it is written, and the issue of is the book worth reading.   <br /> <br />The book is a political biography.  It focuses almost entirely on what John Kerry has said, and what he has done in his political life.   <br /> <br />I thought one area the book was weak was not having more general information about John Kerry's life.  I would like to have learned more about his family life, and any hobbies, or interesting events in his life.  Even one chapter giving some background would have provided more context for the rest of the book.  One of the few things mentioned about his childhood, which I found sad, was that John Kerry was shipped off to a boarding school at age ten, and really didn't have a home after that.  During summers he would be sent to live with an aunt or some other relative. <br /> <br />The book is broken down into 15 chapters.  There is the introduction, then thirteen chapters focusing on different areas of politics, and then a conclusion which sums up some reasons why John Kerry would be a bad president.  The middle thirteen chapters cover areas like International relations, homeland security, John Kerry and contributions, guns, medicine, and education.  Time andtime again the book quotes John Kerry taking a stand on an issue, and then later to take the opposite stand, and then later to come back to the first position.  And the book would quote John Kerry as taking an one stand on an issue, and then voting (in the rare instances when he did vote) on the other side of the issue. <br /> <br />The book is well researched.  There are hundreds and hundreds of footnotes.  The author clearly has done a lot of research.  The footnotes would be a good starting place for someone wanting to do more research about John Kerry. <br /> <br />The book is well written.  It isn't classic literature, and in five or ten years probably most people will forget about this book.  But it is an easy book to read.   <br /> <br />So if you like John Kerry, don't bother to read the book.  If John Kerry scares you, then reading this book will reinforce your beliefs.  If you want to learn more about John Kerry, and recognize that the author is trying to raise concerns about John Kerry, then you can find the book useful.   <br />    <br />	2004-09-18

The idea being that the sooner children were taught to read, write, and do arithmetic, the more mastery they'll have of these subjects.  I was surprised to learn that a hundred years ago in some states it was against the law for children to go to school until they were at least eight years old.<br /><br />Raymond & Dorothy Moore spent years investigating the results of early education.  They examined other studies and did their own studies.  They found that in the early years, up to somewhere around ages 8 to 10, it is best for children to be at home in a loving and supportive environment.  They found that children who are kept home until they are ready for school quickly catch up with the early starters.<br /><br />One of the main points is children can't effectively learn until they are developmentally ready.  The book explores readiness issues dealing with eye sight, hearing, coordination, ability to focus, emotional stability, and others.  Once children have hit a certain level, then their ability to learn is amazing.  The book explores some of the problems that can happen when a child is forced to learn before they are ready.<br /><br />Another main point in the book is how the home is the best place for young children.  It is acknowledged that in some situations, like a working single parent, a child may need to be put in preschool, but that the optimal environment is a home where the child feels secure and is free to develop at his own pace.  They are free to make mistakes without 25 other students making fun of them.  They feel loved.  One of the problems with sending children off to preschool is how many of them feel rejected by their parents.<br /><br />The second half of the book covers various age ranges and gives insight on what is happening to children at this age and advice on how parents can best support and help their children.<br /><br />This book is well written.  There is a ton of good information in it.  If you are interested in how best to help a young child, this is a good book to read.w parents can best support and help their children.<br /><br />This book is well written.

Afterwards they talk about the meaning of the story and how they can deal better with life now. <br /> <br />The main part of the book is the story of two mice and two little people who live in a maze.  They find a large stockpile of cheese and are happy for awhile.  Over time the cheese is eaten up.  The mice have noticed this and are ready to move on.  They quickly move on finding new cheese fairly quickly.  The two little people are angry and upset.  At first they are unwilling to look for new cheese.  Over time one of them finally makes the venture out into the maze looking for more cheese.  Along the way he learns a number of lessons. <br /> <br />The basic message is the things we want in life may not always be there.  We need to be flexible and prepared.  So for example if a job goes away and we are prepared to find another job, then life will be better.  If we don't prepare and resist change, then life will be harder.  Each of us has different cheese, things we want and feel good about.  It is easy to cling to one specific cheese.  The book is encouraging us to take initiative and prepare for the curves life throws us. <br /> <br />If you are already working hard to be prepared for change, then you probably don't need to read this book.  If you are coasting along, then investing a half hour in reading this book would be very worthwhile. <br />	2004-09-04

This is an amazing attack on the public education system.  Almost everything is explored, how teachers teach, what teachers teach, the kind of people attracted to education, all the politics of education, how much money is spent on education, and on, and on, and on. <br /> <br /> The first hundred pages focus on the first thirteen years of schooling, from kindergarten to twelfth grade.  The rest of the book explores just how many problems there are in colleges and universities.   <br /> <br /> The first chapter, \\"Decline, Deception, and Dogmas,\\" opens the book with Thomas Sowell reviewing just how bad the public education system has gotten.  Students are not being taught the basics, and are being brain washed.  Much of the particular details Sowell explores fall into one or both of these categories.  There has been a marked decline in learning, with a parallel dramatic increase in A's and B's.  Thomas Sowell says part of the reason for the grade inflation is so parents feel good about their children and don't realize the children are not learning anything.  Students are being taught to feel good about themselves, even when they are learning very little.  American students are failing in both rote learning and in problem solving.  One of my favorite lines went something like: \\"Johnny can't read.  Johnny can't think.  And Johnny doesn't even know what thinking is.\\"  Students often confuse thinking with feelings.     <br /> <br /> Thomas Sowell covers how the public education system has five basic responses to criticism: secrecy, camouflage, denial, shift the blame, and then ask for more money.  States which spend more money per capita don't do better <br /> <br /> The third chapter, \\"Classroom Brainwashing,\\" is about how so many groups are trying to use the public school system to influence and even control how children think, so little time is left to be spent on teaching the children the basics and how to think.  Most of these groups have different agendas, but all of them work at separating the individual from his family.  Thomas Sowell talks about a number of the different type of brainwashing techniques used in the classroom. <br /> <br /> After four chapters on K-12, the book moves on to problems in colleges and universities.  There are a scary number of problems. <br /> <br />After reading this the first time I went out and bought three more copies to loan to friends.  This is a great book for anyone who is interested in the current state of public education in America.  It is well written and well documented.  In many ways it is sad, this was written back in 1992, and if anything things have gotten worse. <br /> <br />	2004-09-04

A seemly simple question has been at the root of this debate: \\"What is the purpose of education?\\"  <br /> <br />Through the 1800s for most teachers the answer was to teach children how to read, write, and do arithmetic. This was called the academic curriculum. By the late 1800s there was almost universal schooling. <br /> <br />Starting in the early 1900s, some education leaders thought it was best to prepare children for the job market, and especially once the IQ tests become popular, children were tested and slotted for a college track, or other tracks, as early at age six and seven. Some people pushed to improve self-esteem as the only real goal of education. Additionally many leaders of education started seeing schools as a place to \\"improve\\" society, and they wanted to go behind the backs of the parents and mold the children. <br /> <br />Over the years there has been a wide variety of programs, some of which have been a bit useful or effective, most have been destructive. For example in the 1920s and 1930s there was a push to be efficient in education, and that by figuring out where children would be working as adults and giving them only the education they would need, the schools could be good use of resources. There was a belief by some of the experts that students had little ability to transfer knowledge. As an extreme example of what this belief mean, just because students had been taught the basics of addition, they would have to learn from scratch the basics of subtraction. Because of this belief there was little interest in teaching children more than they really \\"needed\\" to know. <br /> <br />The questions people asked about the purpose of education are good questions to ask. It is helpful to know why children are going to schools. The author clearly feels that many of the leaders of education make big mistakes, and millions of children have sufferedfrom an inadequate education. For example many people in the 1950s and 1960s felt that black children would grow up to have the menial jobs, so it was best to only teach them the basics; that it would be bad to try and force them to learn more than they would ever use. <br /> <br />And on the flip side, in the 1980s many experts felt that self-esteem was the only thing that matter, once children had good self-esteem, they would learn what they needed to know. So there were whole programs designed to help children have a strong positive self-image. Out of these schools came large numbers of children with little knowledge, but they felt good about themselves. <br /> <br />The author mentions program after program that were inflicted on children. The author goes over some of the various types of damage the children suffered. Then a group of education leaders would come up with a new program, lead another national movement, and a new group of children would suffer. <br /> <br />This is a good book for anyone who is trying to understand the current set of problems schools in our nation are facing. One of the fascinating things is how many of today's proposals have been tried in the past, and sometimes they have been tried several times.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-04

Most of the rest of the book focuses how in different ways public schools are trying to remake society. <br /> <br />There were a number of interesting points made in the book.  For example John Stormer points out that it doesn't take years to teach Sex Education, the basics can be taught in an hour, maybe a couple hours if you really take your time.  The reason Sex Education is taught for so long is to wear down the values being taught at home.  Many at public schools are looking to have schools replace the family.<br /> <br />If you are concerned about the decline in American Education over the last fifty years, but you aren't interested in a religious point of view, check out \\"Inside American Education.\\"  If you are a Christian, and want more information on what is happening in public schools, this book is a good one to check out.  \\"None Dare Call It Education\\" is well written and well documented. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-04

How you see a problem affects your ability to solve it.  Even the smartest people in the world have trouble solving problems if they see the problems from a bad perspective. <br /> <br />Michael Brone's perspective on trends and problems in American society may be worth 20 IQ points.  He looks at many areas in America and breaks them down into \\"Hard\\" or \\"Soft\\".   For the purposes of the book \\"Hard\\" is where there is competition and accountability; people suffer or reap the consequences of their actions.  \\"Soft\\" is when people are protected from competition and not held accountable; they are coddled. <br /> <br />The book explores changes in Education, Big Business, Government, Big Unions, Crime, Military, and other areas.  One of the interesting points made in the book is that there is constant change.  For example Big Business was soft 50 years ago and has grown harder; however, Education has only grown softer over the last 50 years.  Michael Barone shows the consequences of what happens when an area is hard or soft.  While he acknowledges there are reasons for softness, Michael Barone clearly believes that it is best for all parts of society to have some degree of hardness. <br /> <br />The book is well written and the material is well presented.  It is a quick read; the main part of the book is only 162 pages.  I would have liked it to be longer.  It was very thought provoking and gave me a number of ideas to think about.  I found it worth reading, and felt it was a good investment of my time.   <br /> <br />The approach of looking at issues in terms of Hard or Soft does provide some good insights.  Michael Barone has provided a unique perspective on life in America over the last hundred years.  If you want to improve your understanding of many of the important modern issues, this is a good book to read. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-02
US	38267055	R3DOR818ENJKWF	1566635675	562033722	Doomed to Fail: The Built-in Defects of American Education	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Great insight into the problems with American Education	As any good doctor knows you don't rush to a prescription until you have a good diagnosis of a problem.  In trying to solve the problems of education in America it helps to understand just what are the root causes of poor performance over the last fifty years.  Paul Zoch creditably claims that current efforts are doomed to fail. <br /> <br /> While reading \\"Doomed to Fail\\" often I would think about the joke of a man who comes out into a parking lot and finds a second man under a lamppost hunched over looking at the ground.  The first man asks \\"What are you doing?\\"  The second man says \\"I've lost my keys.\\"  So the first man comes over and starts to help.  After a few minutes he says \\"I don't see them, are you sure you lost them here?\\"  The second man says \\"No, I think I lost them over there where it is dark, but the light is so much better here.\\" <br /> <br /> Paul Zoch argues very persuasively that in trying to fix problems in education by focusing on teachers, we're missing the more important issue of having the students take ownership for what they learn.  He points out that when anyone learns, there is the individual learning, and the subject material being learned, there doesn't have to be a teacher.  A teacher can help a student save time, but the main effort of learning has to be done by the student.  The main point of this book is that by focusing on the role of teachers, we are looking in the wrong place, and we'll never find good solutions. <br /> <br /> The author explores some history of education in America and shows that a hundred years ago it was expected that students would take initiative and spend the effort to master the material.  Then over the last hundred years education theories have evolved to the point where the teacher has become responsible for the students mastering subjects.  So now most students sit back and expect to be entertained and somehow learn, without the students having to put forth much, if any effort. <br /> <br /> The conclusion was a bit rushed, and a bit forced.  Since it appears that some of problems in American education are the result of government interference in education, it wasn't clear to me how having more government involvement would really make things better.  I would have given the book five stars if the conclusion was stronger.  The first six chapters provide great insight.  The seventh chapter was interesting and thought provoking.  The success of schools in Japan does emphasis the author's point that education is primarily the responsibility of the student.  The eighth chapter's arguments for more government programs in America seemed weak. <br /> <br /> For anyone interested in why students are coming out of school with a poor, poor education, this book shines great light and is very worth reading.  The book is well written and is very informative.  It provides compelling arguments that efforts to improve education by focusing on teachers are doomed to fail.     <br />	2004-08-31

The authors address a fundamental question, \\"Are we alone in the universe?\\"  They focus on various stages that other planets would have to go through to be like our Earth.  They explain why each stage is very unlikely, and that this means our Earth is a very, very special place. <br /> <br /> The Drake Equations, developed by Frank Drake, were an attempt to make an intelligent guess on the number of space going civilizations in our galaxy, and the whole universe.  There were several factors, each having to do with a stage along the path to a space going civilization.  Some scientists came up with a number like a couple million space going civilizations in our galaxy.  The authors of \\"Rare Earth\\" believe that this is way too high.  They break down the various factors of the Drake Equations and explain why it is unlikely to get through that stage successfully. <br /> <br /> The authors make a large number of interesting observations.  For example one of the things I found fascinating was in the last 500 million years there have been 15 mass extinctions of life on Earth.  Another was just how important Jupiter being in a stable orbit has been in cleaning out random junk, thus reducing the amount of junk that could hit the Earth.  Jupiter has probably cleared out 99.99% of the junk floating around our sun. <br /> <br /> For me the most interesting thing was what the moon was doing to the Earth billions of years ago.  Current models show some body of matter coming close to the Earth, losing its iron core to the Earth, and then some of the left over matter forming into the moon.  It appears the moon originally may have been 15 times closer than it is now, so the gravity from the moon would have been 225 times greater.  It appears this generated land tides in which the land on the Earth might be going up and down by hundreds of feet every couple hours, with the \\"waves\\" going thousands of miles per hour. <br /> <br /> The book is full of many such interesting things.  It is well written and I had a hard time putting it down.  The authors comment on a large variety of topics relating to how unique our Earth may be.  If you have any interest in this topic, this is a good book to read. <br /> <br />	2004-08-27

Part of the reason his westerns were so popular is because of his extensive research.  His descriptions of times and places in his stories were about real events and situations.  As a young man he spent time working in the west, long after the exciting events he wrote about took place.  But he was able to talk with old men and women who had lived through the settling of the West.<br /><br />\\"Last of the Breed\\" has the same level of detail.  This was written back in 1986, and so it is a bit dated.  The Soviet Union is long gone.  He did a lot of research.  The description of what Siberia was like ten to fifteen years ago is well done.  Louis L'Amour shows us what life was like under the communist government.  This provides a rich background for the story.<br /><br />The story is exciting.  In the beginning we find Joe Mack has been captured by the Soviets.  He quickly escapes, and is on the run for the next two years.  We watch his struggles as he survives in a hostile environment.  The environment alone is enough to try most people, but Joe Mack also has hundreds of people out looking for him, trying to recapture him.<br /><br />It is a fun story.

Individualist Tradition in America Series)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Arguments against public schools, from 120 years ago	The book was originally published back in 1889.  The author is against public schools.  He lived in California, and had been nominated for Assistant Attorney General to the United States.  There was a big fight in the United States Senate in trying to get him confirmed.  The author claims there were a number of lies said about him, and so he wrote this book to set the record straight on what he believes, and why. <br /> <br />The author sees education as either parental or anti-parental.  Parental education is where the parent is in charge; today this includes private schools, voucher schools, homeschool, and similar settings.  Anti-parental education is where the parent has little say, and the state is in charge, today we call this public school. <br /> <br />The author has a number of reasons why he is against public schools.  Interestingly enough some of his first reasons use statistics comparing New England states, which have public schools, with states in the South which have parental schools.  The anti-parental states have greater crime, suicide, insane, and vagrancy by two to four times more among white, native-born adults on a per capita basis.  He says that this difference is largely due to the New England states having public schools.  The author does explore some other possible reasons for this difference, but comes to the conclusion that it is largely due to the public school system. <br /> <br />The author is concerned that children in the public school system are being taught to embrace a strong centralized government.  The author frequently uses religious arguments.   <br /> <br />The author points out that parents have a duty to feed, clothe, and educate their children.  But with public schools the state has usurped the authority of parents of being in charge of the education of their children.  For parents who couldn't afford to pay for their children's education he puts forth a system similar to a voucher system. <br /> <br />All in all it was an interesting book.  The writing style and presentation are a bit dated.  It was interesting to read about California and the United States almost 120 years ago.  For the historical context of arguments against public schools, this may be worth reading.  There are more recent books that are better written. <br /> <br />	2004-08-19

Some are bad, and you realize you have wasted your time.  Some are average, and you might learn a few new things, but they aren't all that memorable.  Some are great, and you go back to them again and again.  \\"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\\" is one of the great books.  Years later people remember it, talk about it, and reread it. <br /> <br />\\"Life Matters\\" is a great book.  It covers a lot of good ideas, the thoughts and observations are well presented, and the book reads quickly. <br /> <br />The first chapter starts off talking about what is important in life.  The authors focus on four areas: work, family, time, and money.  They have a quiz to help in your self-assessment of how you are doing in each of these four areas.  A big message of this book is there doesn't have to be conflict between the four areas. <br /> <br />The next chapter covers three things you have to do in any area of your life.  The three \\"gotta do's\\" are: <br /> <br />1) Validate your expectations.  You have to confront reality, for if you have an unrealistic expectation you will be frustrated.  The authors make the point that the direction you are heading is more important than how fast you are going. <br /> <br />2) Optimize Effort.  Look for ways to get the maximum benefit for your effort, and make sure your decisions are aligned with your goals. <br /> <br />3) Develop your \\"Navigational\\" intelligence.  This is the ability to be aware of your changing environment, so that what looked like an important task at the start of the day may have to take a back seat when your boss gives you a new assignment, or a child needs attention.   <br /> <br />The next four chapters are on: work, family, time, and money, with a chapter on each area.  The authors weave each of the above three \\"gotta do's\\" into each area.  For each area they explore different ways people see the area, for example how do you see your family, or your money.  And then they discuss what is the reality.  They have a list of \\"optimizers\\" which are techniques for getting the maximum benefit for your effort.  And they talk about how to be flexible when situations change.   <br /> <br />\\"Seven Habits\\" mentions a Time Matrix, which is a two dimensional matrix based on how important something is, and how urgent it is.  Many people waste time on things that aren't important, or get caught up doing things that are important and urgent.  Stephen Covey explores why doing things that aren't urgent, but important, can make a great difference in your life.  For me one of the gems of \\"Life Matters\\" was exploring this same matrix in relation to money.  The Merrill's point is that it is best to invest your money with the same Quadrant II focus, things that aren't urgent, but are important.  For me, that idea alone was worth reading the book.  There were a number of similar gems scattered through the book. <br /> <br />The last chapter was titled \\"Wisdom Matters\\" and here the authors explore why wisdom is important, and how to improve your wisdom.  One of the points they strongly make is to develop an ongoing daily self-important program.  The idea is to spend a few minutes each day improving your understanding of life, and how to make better decisions. <br /> <br />This is a great book.  If you are interested in improving your life, buy this book, read this book, and then reread it.  It will help you get better control of your life.  For as the Merrills say, life does matter. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-17

The book is only about 300 pages and is a fairly quick read.  There are lots of pictures.   <br /> <br /> Patton grew up in California, his father was Old South gentry, and his mother's father was a fairly rich self made man.  Patton idealized his military roots.  Fairly early in life Patton wanted to become famous and felt the honorable way was to do so in the army.  Patton appears to have had dyslexia.  School was a struggle for him which he overcame through hard work. <br /> <br /> As a teenager Patton meet Beatrice Ayer who later become his wife.  She was from a rich family.  Through her emotional support Patton was able to keep struggling all his life against his self doubts.  Without her support it doesn't sound like Patton would have been nearly as successful.  They had two daughters and a son. <br /> <br /> The kind of character description of Patton this book gives is a gifted man who was focused on himself.  He wanted glory and he wanted to be known.  He wanted to be famous.  He often did things to make sure he was noticed.  He pulled strings to get the attention of higher commanding officers.   <br /> <br /> Also unfortunately he wasn't faithful to his wife.  There were a couple mentions of how many condoms he used in a short period.  Patten had a long affair with his niece.  And after he died, the niece killed herself.  She left a note that she would be with Uncle Georgia before Beatrice. <br /> <br /> Strategically and tactically George Patton seemed to have been almost without peer.  He studied war for over forty years.  But his greater gift may have been his ability to train and motivate large groups of soldiers.  In two instances Patton was given an army and fairly quickly he improved the level of performance several levels.  The Third Army, which was under his command from after D-Day to the end of the war, was largely an untrained and unseasoned group of men.  But they took the most number of prisoners, and moved the quickest across dozens of miles in a day.  George Patton seems to have consciously taken on an act of swearing and cussing to be at the level of the common solider, but then when he meet with his officers he was much more refined.  He told his Third Army they were different, he told them they were on a righteous cause, and he asked a lot of them.  They came through. <br /> <br /> Over all George Patton comes across as a flawed person who achieved some greatness.

I think that in some places their arguments are weak, and often they misrepresented history and/or maybe misunderstand history, so I'm very cautious to trust all that they say. The book basically went through 10 myths they feel are harming American education, there is one chapter per one myth.  <br />  <br /> The first chapter, &quot;Myth 1 - Schools can save society&quot; makes a very good point that too often the public school system is asked to do way too much stuff. But starting on page two I realized you need to be very careful with trusting what they said, on page two it reads something like: &quot; ... the founding Fathers ... started an education system.&quot; The founding fathers of the United States had no education system at the national level, and up until around 1850 there were no state education systems. I don't think they were referring to some educational founding fathers, but maybe they were trying to be clever. As early as the 1900's it looks like John Dewey was trying to expand the role of education beyond the three R's. There is a long list of various problems which lots of different types of people have tried to get the public school system to solve. I do agree with the author's conclusion that the solution is to get back to the knitting and have the public school system focus on teaching basic education.  <br />  <br /> The second chapter, &quot;Myth 2 - A National Standardized testing program will boast Achievement in American Schools,&quot; was about how misused national testing has become. Some basic problems are: <br />  <br /> 1) Teachers teach to the test, so children pass the test, but often don't have a deep understanding of the material. <br /> 2) Because the tests are board, the teachers don't cover the subject in depth. <br /> 3) Because schools are rated against each other, and get money, there is a focus on scoring well, rather than teaching. <br />  <br /> The authors like testing, they just feel it has to be done right. They want the state and federal government to set guidelines and allow local people to design and implement the tests.  <br />  <br /> The third chapter, &quot;Teacher Unions have helped teachers and education,&quot; was very heavy against unions. The authors assert that the natural progression in relationships between management and workers in both industry and education administration is from paternalism to enemy to an adversarial relationship, and then finally collaboration. They said this is alike a child growing up. The authors claim the teachers unions have gotten stuck in the adversary role. They claim the solution is to pass more laws which outlaw strikes and push unions and school administration into collaboration. I do agree that teacher unions have made education worse; I don't think more laws like the ones the authors push will fix the problem. <br />  <br /> The fourth chapter is on the myth of &quot;School Boards are good for American education,&quot; is about how school boards micromanage and tend to be motivated by politics. The authors seem to feel American education started in 1826. And while it may be that there was some local public school system back in 1826, people were going to schools in America way back into the early 1600s. The authors don't like school boards to get too involved in the details, they want school boards to do oversight stuff, and leave the administration to professionals. So they want more laws to change and limit the power of school boards. They don't address the issue of how limiting the power of the school boards then makes the school administration less accountable. <br />  <br /> The fifth chapter, &quot;Self-esteem must come first, then learning,&quot; is a good explanation on how schools are being asked to do so much, much of which doesn't work. There is a movement in American education which believes that by getting Johnny to feel good about himself he will then want to learn. The authors attack this. This chapter was interesting, in the preface the authors make a big deal about how during the Reagan administration there was some kind of cover up on the results of some study, that part of the reason test scores were going down is more people were taking tests, people twenty years ago who won't have been going to college, and so this lowered the average. Thomas Sowell makes the point that even for the top schools, test scores have been going down over the last forty years, so their argument is suspect. Their basic point in this chapter, that teachers shouldn't worry about self-esteem but focus on education, makes sense. <br />  <br /> The sixth chapter, &quot;Our practice of grouping and grading students are effective and efficient methods for meeting the education needs of children,&quot; is about how they don't like children being lumped together by age group. And they don't like give F's to children. They would rather have the children proceed at their own pace and pass on to the next level when they are ready and pass a test. The authors want the test administered by a professional. In some ways this sounds like how the single room schools use to work.  <br />  <br /> There are several other myths that the authors explore. <br />  <br /> If you are interested in the problems with education in The United States today, this is an OK book to read. There are better ones to read, but this does have some interesting insights and observations. A really good book on the problems in education in America is &quot;Insided American Education&quot; by Thomas Sowell. <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-07-30

Twenty years later most politicians still agree that education is broken, and if you vote for them, they'll fix education; yet year after year children leave the public school system with declining test scores, and many of these children are functionally illiterate.  <br />  <br /> As any good doctor knows, you need to understand just what the problem is before making a diagnosis. E. G. West's book, &quot;Education and the State&quot; largely explores the history of Education in Great Britain. In looking at the problems of education in Great Britain, there is a lot of insight into what works and what doesn't work. Up until 1870, education was largely a private concern that the parents of children dealt with. Things dramatically changed in 1870 under the Foster Act, which put government into what had been a private concern. <br />  <br /> The author asks a number of good questions about why the government should be involved and are there better ways for the government to be involved.  <br />  <br /> E. G. West looks into the two main arguments for the intrusion of government into education. The first is the government needs to protect children from neglectful parents. The second is the government should be involved because of the effect education has on society. <br />  <br /> In response to the first argument E. G. West looks at the data in the early 1800s and shows that by and large parents had not been neglectful. He asks why we trust the same parent to vote, but won't let them chose where to send their children to school. He points out that it is important not to let children starve, but we don't force parents to send their children to specific public kitchens. And it is important that people know the rules of driving, but we let people chose where they learn to get an education in how to drive.  <br />  <br /> In response to the second argument the author shows data that education doesn't reduce crime. He explores the effect of education on democracy. One thing I found funny was that in the early 1800s many people in government were complaining that people were too literate. He explores the connections between education & equality of opportunity, education & economic growth, and education & the quest for 'common values.'  <br />  <br /> The basic conclusion E. G. West comes to is government should not be so involved in education, and especially in forcing parents to send their children to a particular school. He argues strongly for a voucher system to allow people to find the solutions best for their children, and as a way to encourage schools to do a better job.  <br />  <br /> This was originally written in 1965, but this is still an informative book to read. For anyone interested in the fundamental questions about just what the role of government should be in education, this is a good book for a second perspective into how having the government involved in educations creates a number of problems. <br />	2004-07-30

There are three presentations for each balloon creation.  One version shows how the proportions look on the balloon as it is laid out.  Another shows a diagram with the sequence of each twist.  For anything complex there are several diagrams showing the creation in steps.  And the final presentation shows the finished project.  Taken individually these are OK, but together they are very helpful. <br /> <br />I've only looked at a few books so far on folding and twisting balloons, but this is my favorite.  If you are trying to learn how to fold balloons, this is a good book to start with. <br />	2004-07-21

He talks about people who did brave deeds. Many of the events are in wars. Some of his comments about these events are confusing. It isn't really clear just what he is trying to teach us. He talks about how it is important to be brave, but then sometimes he bewails the costs of being brave.  <br />  <br /> For example he talks about is a mother in East Baltimore, a rough neighborhood. She works to keep the drug dealers out of her front yard. They don?t like this. Finally one of her neighbors lights her house on fire, and she and her family are burned to death. Senator McCain says maybe she was too brave. What does this mean? Does he want us to be brave, but only in certain situations? He just comments that it is sad, but doesn't really explain what lessons he wants us to learn. In a similar vein he talks about the battles in the island of Pelelu during the end of World War II. Men on both sides were brave, but Senator McCain dwells on the waste, so it wasn't clear what the point was. <br />  <br /> At a number of places in the book he briefly mentions some of his experience being a prisoner of war, but there are very few details. It would have been nice to have more insight into his life through this time. <br />  <br /> The stories of courage he tells come from around the world. The stories are well told, and for the most part do show how men and women with courage made a difference. Aung San Suu Kyi standing up to the Burma (Myanmar) generals reminded me of the lone man stopping the tanks at Tiananmen Square. This one woman has shaken the military dictators who run Burma.  <br />  <br /> At the end of the book he does talk very briefly about how we can develop courage by doing the things we fear. This is more of an afterthought, than a point to which he has been building. <br />  <br /> There are many good thoughts. The book is a quick read, and some of the stories were very interesting. A better title would have been &quot;Thoughts and stories about Courage.&quot; It is worth reading. <br />  <br />	2004-07-20

He looks at what really happens after affirmative programs are implemented, as opposed to the claims of what would happen.  He finds there have been horrible costs from affirmative action programs.<br />There is a saying: &quot;In theory there is no difference between theory and reality.  In reality there is.&quot;  Thomas Sowell shows the reader how the reality of affirmative action is greatly different from the theory.<br />The bulk of the book focuses on five countries; there is a chapter on each of the following: India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and the United States.  In each of these chapters there is a brief overview, the historical setting, a detailed analysis of the types of quotas &amp; preferences various groups got, an examination of what happened, and then some conclusions.<br />Again and again I would think of the Law of Unintended Consequences, for as Thomas Sowell points out that (especially in dealing with humans) you can not always predict the outcome of a particular action.  One of Thomas Sowell's points is those who have been pushing for affirmative action have a very, very poor track record in being able to predict how the affirmative action programs will help.  They will make great claims, but the reality has been very different.<br />Thomas Sowell finds there are some basic patterns in all of the affirmative action programs.  Almost always the programs are promoted as being temporary, but they become permanent.  The programs are supposed to be for a specific group, but other groups push for their cause to try and join the bandwagon (gravy wagon).  Often those who are suppose to be getting the benefit miss out; a recent example in the United States has been the news that the blacks getting into Harvard are not the decedents of those who were slaves in the United States.  Also the groups &quot;needing&quot; help wereoften doing better before the affirmative action programs than after the programs.  He makes the point that there have always been differences in how various groups succeed, for example the Japanese suffered in the United States during World War II, and even more in Canada, yet they are very successful today.  And groups that were doing well a hundred years ago aren't always the most successful today.<br />Thomas Sowell documents how the costs of affirmative action programs have been heavy.  The relationships between the various groups get worse because of resentment and a sense of injustice.  For example if 100 students for the &quot;favored&quot; group are admitted to a university, then the 800 who don't get in tend to be a bit hostile to the favored group.  There have been race riots, and even civil wars.  There has been an overall lost to society, as those that are favored tend not to try as hard because they have an edge, while the rest tend to give up because they don't have the extra help.<br />This is a good book.  It is well documented and very thoughtful.  Thomas Sowell makes a strong, convincing, argument that we shouldn't have affirmative action programs.  If you are interested in the subject of affirmative action, this is a good book to read.	2004-07-10

I happened to see this book in the library last week.  Having read a ton of comics through the 1980s, ten to fifteen comics a week was fairly typical, I was very interested in learning more about Stan Lee.  I found this a fascinating book.  The authors write well.  The book is entertaining, and it is hard to put down.<br />The authors do a good job of setting the stage.  In addition to explaining and documenting just who Stan Lee is; the authors provide background by showing us Stan's early years, a whole lot about the comic industry, and those who have worked with Stan Lee.  Having the background of the comic industry was fun.  <br />For example I had never understood why for so many years the fights in the comics were mostly with fists.  The book explains that in reaction to concerns about negative affects of comics, the comic industry started following a set of codes created in the 1950s.  One of the codes was the restriction of guns.  <br />The book clearly shows that Stan Lee comes across as a nice guy; moreover, it shows some of Stan Lee's major character flaws.  A big one is his consistent pattern over decades of taking the credit for other people's work.  This was not a one time event.  He likes to be well known, and worked hard over the years to be famous.  I was also disappointed to read of his experimenting with alternative comics, and his attempts to get into pornography.  <br />In contrast to DC, many of the superheroes Stan Lee is known for were the misunderstood who did the right thing even when they weren't appreciated.  Spiderman was constantly mistrusted and even persecuted, but he always fought the bad guys, he always did the right thing.  So it is ironic that Stan Lee is know for creating superheroes who did the right things, even when it was not popular; however, he did the wrong things in taking creating so he could be popular.<br />All in all it was a fun book to read.	2004-06-29

Cheri Pierson Yecke focuses on the middle school movement over the last 30 plus years, and how many facets of the middle school movement have hurt specifically the talented and gifted children, but also children in general.  She does a great job in reviewing various pieces of the middle school change.  She has hundreds of footnotes; many of them are as interesting as the main text of the book.<br />The author starts off with a historical perspective of education and then covers how recently there has been a push to change to a K-5, middle school, and high school structured approach.  The motivation of many behind the middle school movement has been a desire to \\"fix\\" society.  Historically education has meant learning how to read, write, and how to do math.  Many in the middle school movement wanted to do social engineering.  Instead of trying to teach each student as much as the child could learn, the middle school radicals have pushed for equal outcomes.  This is in direct contrast to what advocates for the talented and gifted want. <br />Over time many of the middle school radicals have become hostile to the needs and interests of the talented and gifted.  Cheri Pierson Yecke acknowledges that this was one of the main motivations for her going back to school and get a PhD, to try and understand why the needs of her own children were not being meet.  <br />Chapter three was on how the middle school curriculum has been dumbed down, so everyone can pass the same course.  Next was a chapter on \\"Ability Grouping\\" and how the middle school movement has fought \\"Ability Grouping\\" as being elitist.  <br />The next chapter was about \\"Cooperative learning\\" which has small groups of children working together.  This may be a good idea once in awhile, but the middle school movement does a lot of it.  Cooperative learning advocates defend it by saying it is good for the gifted, but by andlarge the gifted students find it a waste of time.  The gifted students often end up doing a lot of the work, and the rest of the group gets a free ride, or the gifted student doesn't contribute, and the group suffers.  In effect the gifted students is being forced to be a teacher's assistant.  This is explored even more in the chapter on \\"Peer tutoring.\\"  For me a very key part of the problem is the gifted students, at a young age, are being forced to teach those who don't want to learn.  Mature adults may be able to find reasonable solutions, but most young children often find this an impossible situation to deal with.<br />Chapter seven does some analysis of the beliefs and driving convictions of those pushing the middle school movement.  Based on what they say publicly Cherie Pierson Yecke finds that many of them want equal outcomes.  Rather than having a level playing field where everyone has an equal chance to succeed, the middle school radicals want coercive egalitarianism, they want to force everyone to be the same.  Chapter eight points out that often to implement their goals they will hide or misdirect parents and the public in general about what is happening in the middle school.<br />Chapter nine discusses the ethical considerations of the middle school movement.  The author quotes a number of people who study ethics, who say that people should have voluntary informed consent.  The radical activists are using children to achieve the ends the radical activists want.  I felt the author was too gentle here.  If I go to a dentist for a filling and he gives me a root cannel, he has been unethical, and I'll sue.  If I go to a lawyer for a will, and he takes my money without producing what I want, he clearly is being unethical.  But when parents and the public, who pay taxes, voice their desires about what they want in an education, many in the middle school movement will ignore the direction of the public and go off and do what the middle school radicals want.<br />The last chapter addresses what does all of this mean for the twenty first century.  If middle schools keep dumbing down our children, then we as a nation will not be able to compete.  <br />I greatly enjoyed this book.  It is well thought out, addresses a serious problem in our society, and is well documented.  If you have young gifted and talented children, and if you want them to get a strong academic education, then this would be a very good book to read.	2004-06-26

It is easy for school reformers to get distracted from what they have influence over.  Many school reformers point to factors outside their control, &quot;education will get better with better nutrition, or better families, etc...&quot;  Frederick Hess says this approach lets teachers and administrators off the hook.  <br />     Frederick Hess talks about some specifics of the problems with education in public schools, for example: teachers are hired with very little attention to merit, or principals can't deny pay raises to ineffective teachers.<br />     In talking about reform Frederick Hess makes the distinction between two types of school reformers.  First are those who want cosmetic reform, without changing anything fundamental.  He calls this &quot;status quo&quot; reformers, for they want to preserve the status quo.  The second type of reformer he calls the &quot;common sense&quot; reformers, those who recognize that to truly fix public education we need to make major changes. <BR> <BR>     According to Frederick, who I agree with, two major components of the needed change have to deal with: 1) accountability, 2) flexibility.  He spend a lot of time talking about why we need to have both.  <br />     The book is good; there is a lot of insight into the problems with education in America.  For anyone interested in learning about the problems of public educations, and way to help make things better, this is a good book to read.	2004-06-22

He has rarely been equaled, and never surpassed in his ability to tell stories of the struggles people had in the old west.  What few people know is he wrote other stories also.  For example his &quot;Last of the Breed&quot; is a modern day adventure worthy of Tom Clancy.  It does have a feel of the old west.<br />&quot;The Hills of Homicide&quot; is a collection of detective stories from the late 1940s and early 1950s.  Each of them is well written.  A crime is committed, and our hero figures out who committed the crime.  And like his stories of the old west, Louis L'Amour often includes a fight and a girl.<br />These stories from a different period of our countries history and do have a different feel to them.  It is interesting to see how much technology has changed over the last 50 years.  At one point a hero is trying to warn a women of danger, and he gets in a car.  Now he would just get on his cell phone and call her cell phone.<br />These are fun, entertaining stories.  They are the stories of the triumphant good over evil.

(Finding it at the library was tricky; I started looking under &quot;balloon animals.&quot;  It turns out the library had it under &quot;balloon sculpting.&quot;)<br />     Larry does a good job of taking the reader through the basics, and then on to more interesting sculptures.  He starts with the classic dog, and then shows a number of simple variations.  There are several dozen different balloon sculptures.  The pictures were very helpful.  Larry takes the reader step by step through how to make each balloon sculpture.  He writes well.  It is a quick read, taking at most an hour.  <br />     The book starts off saying it is a history book of how balloon animals evolved from plants, and then finally balloon animals evolved into the animals we know today.  The rest of the chapters keep building on this theme.  I found the presentation of this \\"history\\" a bit too cutesy.<br />     This is a good book to start with.  If you want to learn the basics, and get some ideas on different things to try, this is worth getting.	2004-06-03

She has written several books; she is invited to speak at homeschooling conferences; and she has been homeschooling her own children for years.  Most of the books she has written are very targeted at the homeschooling market.  The title of this book indicates the same trend, but the reality is this book is for any family who wants to help their children learn and understand more in their education.  <br />Her first chapter does focus homeschooling, as she talks about some key factors between public schools and homeschooling.  She calls these the &quot;school mind&quot; and the &quot;education mind.&quot;  The &quot;school mind&quot; is more concerned about preserving the public school system than in educating the students.  The &quot;education mind&quot; is focused on trying to help children learn.<br />The rest of the book is a wonderful collection of ideas on how to help children learn, from reading, to math, to character building, to other facets of a children's education.  This is a great resource for rainy days, for when a child is bored, or for when a student is struggling with a particular subject.<br />If you are looking for ways to educate your children, this is a good book to have.	2004-06-03

In a nut shell the author looks at the history of Latin America, and argues that the classic explanation of the Dependency theory of Latin America's poverty relative to the United States is wrong.  For a long time many people in Latin America blamed their problems on the rest of the world, and often the United States was the source of most evil.  This was victimhood on an international level.<br />        Harrison argues that this is wrong, and shows how the legacy of the Spanish and Catholic influences has produced a culture that is anti-progressive.  I was a bit surprised at how often he brings up the importance of child rearing practices.  This is a very well researched book.  It was well written.  It was very thought provoking.	2004-05-26

The phrase &quot;Look in the horse's mouth&quot; appears to have come in response to a group of men arguing about how many teeth a horse had.  Finally one frustrated person pointed out that they could go get some data about the true state of affairs by looking in the horse's mouth.<br /> The authors have gone looking for the true state of affairs in education in the United States.  Hana Skandera and Richard Sousa have reviewed hundreds and hundreds of studies.  The findings of these studies are summarized in this book.<br /> The format of the book is a bit different.  Instead of the normal chapter approach, the authors put forth about 30 propositions, and then go over the data in support of each argument or conclusion.<br /> This book provides a ton of data.  In over three hundred pages there are charts, graphs, and tables.  The data is about every facet of education, some of the data reinforced my beliefs, and some of it was surprised me.  Here are some of the more interesting points made in the book:<br />1) Homework has little effect on student's performance in elementary school; however, it has a huge effect in high school.<br />2) In the United States we currently spend about 4.3% of our GNP on education.  After some basic level of spending there is little correlation between increased spending and performance.  In constant dollars on a per student basis, spending has increased a factor of 20 in over the last 80 years.<br />3) Competition from charter schools has prompted real improvement in traditional public schools.  Test scores for both the children in charter schools and the children left behind have gone up.<br />4) Voucher support is stronger among blacks than the general population.<br />5) Catholic schools do a better job at half the cost.  This is true even with the same groups of students, for example inner-city children.<br />6) Teacher certification has little correlation tothe effectiveness of the teacher.<br />7) The teacher to student ratio has gone from 1 to 28 in 1950, down to 1 to 16 in 1999.<br /> For anyone interested in education in America today, this is a great book to have.	2004-05-20
US	38267055	R4E3QGVAQUU3V	0971412995	884938309	The Story of the World: History for the Classical Child, Volume 3: Early Modern Times	Books	5	134	135	N	N	Continuing in the same great tradition	Volume three arrived in the mail last week, and I read it in two sittings.  It follows the same approach as the first two volumes.  The author, Susan Wise Bauer, has targeted this book at young children.  It is a great book for thoughtful children.  Like the first two books, volume three is written in such a way that it is both entertaining and informative.  <br />Most of the other history books I've read have been very United States focused or European centric.  Volume three covers every part of the world.  You learn what is happening in Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, Africa, India, China, the rest of Asia, and down in Australia & New Zealand.  The book covers the time period from about 1500 to 1850.   <br />I am surprised by just how much content is in each page.  Even though history is presented in an easy flowing story like format, the book is packed with information.<br />There are 42 chapters, each with a focus.  The first chapter starts off with The Holy Roman Empire, and how Spain became so rich with all the gold and silver coming out of Central and South America.  The book ends with the California Gold Rush in 1849 and does a brief overview of the current state of the world in 1849.  In between the book covers topics like the Protestant Rebellion, Warlords of Japan, the Spread of Slavery, Plague in England, the Ottoman Empire, the colonies in the New World, Chi'en-lung's Library, the French Revolution, and lots of wars.  The book also covers how technology was changing the world.  After the 42 chapters there is a five page timeline to help the reader understand when key events happened relative to other key events.<br />The book doesn't pull any punches.  For example in the very first chapter, while talking about all the gold and silver Spain was getting from the New World, we're shown the living conditions of young children working down in the mines.  The book doesn't go into graphic detail, but it does mention the warts of history,times and places where evil things happened. <BR> <BR>To be well rounded and truly educated children need to have a solid understanding of where civilization has been over the last five thousand years.  These \\"Story of the World\\" books are a good starting point.  <br />This is a great way for young children to learn history.  If you enjoyed the first two, you will enjoy volume three.	2004-05-13

The author and his research team starts with two very basic questions.  1) Are there companies which were merely average for a long time, but then turn themselves around and become great companies with a sustainable track records?  2) And if so, what key factors do these companies have?     The research team worked through several decades of stock market data and find eleven companies which for more than 15 years have close to average returns, but then the companies change to have way above average returns for a long period of time.     The main focus of the book is what do these eleven companies have that other companies don't have.  The research team took a very scientifc attitude of what does the data say, instead of trying to force various theories to fit the data.  They come up with seven key factors.  The meat of the book is the seven chapters covering each of these key factors.       The author does a very good job of explaining the seven key factors, how they work, and why they work.  The book is a fairly quick read and is packed with a ton of good ideas.       All of the principles mentioned were explored in terms of how they helped businesses do better.  Many of these principles can also be applied to individuals: develope integrity, figure out your hedgehog concept, be disciplined, and just keep on plodding.     If you are interested in business, this is a good book to read.	2004-05-06

This book is a quick read for adults, but it is packed with information.  The target audience is young children, after all it is &quot;The Story of the World&quot; and it doesn't bore young children.  Our children often would rather hear the next chapter than go play.  And sometimes I'll catch my oldest reading it on her own.  <br /> The book does a good job of providing a balanced look at the major events during the Middle Ages.  The book will focus on one area of the world, going over the major events, who was in charge, and who accomplished some of the important things, like discovering America.  Then the book will move on to another part of the world for a couple chapters.  <br /> Susan Wise Bauer did an excellent job of weaving in various parts of history.  For example in talking about a culture the book might go into a major myth or story of the group.  The variety in pacing flows nicely from history, to what it might have been like to live at the time in a given culture, to some of these myths, and then back again.  This helps keep the children interested.<br /> The book is just right for young children.  When they are young they don't need another 1000 pages of details most of us forget anyways.  This book is written in such away that young children really want to listen, they want to know what happened, and then what will happen next.  They can develop a love for history such that they'll go back and read in more detail about the parts of history they found interesting.<br /> If you are looking for a good book for young children covering the major events of world history during the Middle Ages, this is the best I've found.	2004-02-20

The young girl, Rowan, realizes that life could become very hard.  She had been told that Robin Hood is her father, and so she goes looking for him.  <br /> She has adventures on the way to Sherwood Forrest.  There are a number of minor miracles.  She picks up a dog who becomes her protector.  This has a bit of fantasy and she meets up with some elves who give her some help.    <br /> She finally meets Robin Hood, and isn't sure at first if she can trust him.  They have some adventures together.  <br /> The ending is a bit silly.  A group of young children are suppose to somehow survive the dangerous woods.  It is very exiting, and fun for young children to read about, but only by a steady stream of minor miracles would they be able to survive.<br /> The story has a good feel for seeing medieval times through the eyes of a young girl.  The story is an easy read.  Most young girls will probably enjoy the story.	2004-02-20
US	38267055	R1IHFJN1TIG9B	1572460733	94602519	The Law	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	Good short argument for limited government	This was written in 1850, just after the 1848 revolution in France.  Bastiat was concerned by all the different groups that were trying to use \\"The Law\\" or in Hayek's words, &quot;The State&quot; to remake society into their vision of a more perfect society.  Bastiat argues that trying to use the law to help out one group does so at the expense of another group, he calls this &quot;legal plunder&quot; and points out how in the long run this will ruin society.<br />Bastiat starts off saying that the basic gifts man has from God are: life, liberty, and property.  It is appropriate and correct to defend yourself, your liberty, and your property.  &quot;The Law&quot; was created to ensure that individuals in society were allowed to use these gifts.<br />Bastiat says that unfortunately &quot;The Law&quot; is abused by the greed and false philanthropy of man.  There are two basic ways of getting ahead in life, the first is to work hard and produce, the second is to plunder from others.  When trade off and risks for plunder are better than labor, many people will turn to plunder.  It is very tempting for those who make laws to use the law to plunder.  Bastiat says &quot;legal plunder&quot; is to use the law to take property, which if was done without the benefit of the law would have been considered a crime.<br />He has some fairly pointed barbs at socialists.  He says many of the writers at his time seem to view people as raw material, to be formed or controlled.  He says that most socialists see mankind as evil, while they (the socialists) are good.  This leads the socialists to feeling justified in using &quot;The Law&quot; to make mankind be good.  Bastiat asks why so many people in government feel that mankind makes too many mistakes, but that they in government are nobler and will make better choices.<br />This is short, and because the original format was a pamphlet, Bastiat acknowledges that it is not complete. So many of his points and arguments are brief.<br />This is a good call to action, to encourage people to be more informed about their government, and to work to limit the government.  So much of what Bastiat said long ago is still true.is is a good call to action, to encourage people to be more informed about their government, and to work to limit the government.

For Jody this is the chance of a lifetime.  Jody loves dolphins.<br />Jody records her struggles with an unexpected guest, the excitement of seeing a dolphin, and the normally daily stuff of being at sea.  The story moves along quickly, and is pleasant enough.  <br />The stock characters were a bit disappointing.  Jody's parents are scientists, and are good down to earth people.  The businessmen who are largely sponsoring the trip send along a \\"clueless, detached scientist.\\"  It was mildly funny how the scientist pokes a minor hole in Jody's idealist picture of dolphins.  We also get a \\"spoiled princess\\" who makes life challenging for Jody.<br />All in all it is a fun story that most young girls will enjoy.	2004-01-31

This is less than a hundred pages, but page for page it is a very informative book.  <br /> The author's start the book with something that everyone knows, the current education system is broken, so very broken.  He mentions that in 1983 an education commission commented that &quot;We have done something to ourselves that would be seen as an act of war if a foreign power were to blame.&quot;<br /> His basic premise is market forces are very effective in stimulating reform.  Either you meet the needs of consumers, or you go out of business.  Not all consumers have to be expert consumers, we all benefit from knowledgeable consumers.  Our country is largely successful because we use market forces to constantly improve most parts of our society. <br /> The author goes on to say that while back in 1955 Milton Friedman proposed something like a voucher, but over the last 50 years we've never had a real competitive education market.  The few places that vouchers have been tried have been very laden with restrictions and limitations.<br /> John Merrifield convincingly argues that we need a true education market, or the children of the United States will continue to get a sub-optimal education.<br />There were a couple interesting points in this book:<br /> Currently teachers are mostly motivated to please administrators, parents have very little influence.<br /> In response to people who claim a true education market is too risky, the author responds that changing a badly broken education system doesn't risk much.  (How could it get worse?)<br /> If you are interested in education and/or school choice, this is a good book to start with.	2004-01-26

The clay copies are only good for a day, and their memories can be uploaded back into the original person.  It's kind of an interesting idea.<br /> The hero of the story is an investigator, and Brin gets to have fun with different points of view of the same character.  Different clay copies have different experiences, but the same basic personality comes through.  There are lots of events going on which tie in together at the end.  The hero ends up working for some of the richest people on the planet. <BR> <BR> One of the weak sides to the story is that so little changes in a hundred years.  Given this type of technology it seems like there would be hundreds of ramifications. <BR> <BR> David Brin has been one of my favorite authors.  When he is good, he is very good.  I find that even when he is not at his best, I still enjoy his stories.  The scuttlebutt on the internet was this story wasn't very good.  I finally got around to reading it, and I'm glad I did.  It is a pleasant, fun story.	2004-01-23

The &quot;Disruptive&quot; technology developments are those which don't immediately seem to meet the established customer's demands.  The basic problem is that often the large companies get blindsided by disruptive technology, and they either don't react, or react too late.  Normally someone will figure out a slightly new market for the disruptive technology, improve the basic process, drive down the costs, and then go after the more established markets.<br /> Clayton shows how this model applies to a number of different industries over the last hundred years.  He has a lot of hard data from the Disk Drive industry, but he mentions a number of other industries which underwent fundamental changes, and shows how the old companies were not able to adapt to the changes.<br /> &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; go well together.  They are addressing many of the same issues from different perspectives.  Clayton Christensen is looking at changes in the market place from the point of view of the large established companies, while Geoffrey A. Moore is coming from the other direction, that of a small startup company with some new cool technology.  Clayton is more concerned with technology, while Geoffrey is focused on more on marketing issues.<br /> This is a very well written book, good for anyone in business.  It reads well, and I found it very thought provoking.  There are a lot of good ideas here.	2004-01-21

He was born into wealth and nobility.  He was educated at home and tried to get assigned some posts in the government.  King Henry the 8th was trying to break away from the Catholic Church, and ran into problems with Sir Thomas Moore, which eventually lead to Sir Thomas Moore's execution.  Sir Thomas Elyot knew Moore, and may have been friends with Moore, they had the many of the same interests; however, after the break between Moore and Henry, Elyot tries to distance himself from Moore.  The book may have been written in part to praise the King and curry favor.<br /> The book is written to parents of the governing class who want to raise their children to be leaders, to govern.  Sir Thomas Elyot talks about the kind of education they should have, a home schooling education.  <br /> It was interesting to remember that the world outlook was different 500 years ago.  For example, the author starts off talking about how fire is higher than everything else, because it leaves no residue, and then comes air, water, and finally earth.  Based on this he makes a point.<br />        Over all it was pleasant, but there are much better books to read about politics and education.	2004-01-10

The story opens with a man on a train, Flint, running away from civilization.  At first we know very little about him, but as the story unfolds, we learn more about him.  There are a couple mysteries, who is he and what does he want?  The story moves along quickly, and yet there are lots of details that flush out the people, the location, and the background.<br />  This is one of the Louis L'Amour books I'll reread fairly often.  Louis L'Amour was one of the most popular writers.  All total his books sold in the tens of millions.  His heroes were honest men and women, tough with inner strength.  Mostly they wanted to be left along, but when trouble came their way, they dealt with the trouble.  As a young man Louis spent a couple years out in the West, he talked with people who had lived during the wild times.  So he knew the stories, he knew the flavor, and this comes through in his writing.<br />  If you are new to Louis L'Amour's books, give this one a try.	2004-01-03

Many, many other companies have made billions of dollars; however, Xerox just couldn't figure out how to reap the benefits.<br /> The authors of &quot;Fumbling the Future&quot; go into this history in great detail.  They first set the stage by describing Xerox's early history, how Xerox invented a copier, and for a number of years they were so successful that they were able to basically print money.  Many of the major players in the industry are mentioned, their goals and interests.  Xerox was very aggressive, and in some ways they were also a bit lucky, with the copier.  Then Xerox decided they needed to also get into the computer industry.<br /> Next the authors talk about how the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) was created, how George Pake selected various key people to help staff the research center, and the charter PARC was given.  The book goes over who was hired, what they did, and how the groups at PARC worked together, and sometimes didn't work together.<br /> Here is where you can start to see the train wreck.  The first President of Xerox, Joe Wilson, seems to have been a very gifted leader.  In terms of &quot;Good to Great&quot; by Jim Collins, Joe Wilson was a level five leader.  Unfortunately Joe Wilson dies, and the next president of Xerox, Peter McColough, was at best a level four leader.  Peter decided to spend almost a billion dollars for a niche science computer company which Peter then tried to force out into the general computer market, going up against IBM.  Peter also took Xerox into Medicine and Education.  And Peter got involved in Politics and Charities.  Peter McColough was not focused on Xerox, and let several problems simmer.  <br /> We get some insights into what drove the researchers at PARC to develop the first personal computer, the Alto, andmany of the reasons why it was revolutionary.  The authors chart the destruction of the potential of the Alto, largely because of various managers at Xerox not catching the vision, or those who caught the vision not being able to work well with upper management.<br /> One thing which would have improved the book was to have some pictures.  It would have been nice to have some pictures of the early copiers, the Alto, and some of the major players.  <br /> It was a well written book, with a lot of good history, and some important lessons.  Even though you know how it will all turn out, this was a hard book to put down.	2003-12-30

The cover and comments on the back of the book indicated it was just one more book with a focus on lots of fighting.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised.<br />This is the third and final book in a series about some Americans up on the moon.  Stark leads the military and is working with American colonists.  Some nasty things have been happening to them.  There is lots of excitement.  There is lots, and lots of fighting.  We have a sneak raid, a double cross, a threat from a new deadly weapon, and an internal rebellion.  <br />In some ways this book is similar to the Moon is a Harsh Mistress, but much more emphasis on lots of fighting, with less details about the politics and other issues of a colony on the moon.	2003-12-29

A seemly simple question has been at the root of this debate: &quot;What is the purpose of education?&quot;<br /> Through the 1800s for most teachers the answer was to teach children how to read, write, and do arithmetic.  This was called the academic curriculum.  By the late 1800s there was almost universal schooling.<br /> Starting in the early 1900s, some education leaders thought it was best to prepare children for the job market, and especially once the IQ tests become popular, children were tested and slotted for a college track, or other tracks, as early at age six and seven.  Some people pushed to improve self-esteem as the only real goal of education.  Additionally many leaders of education started seeing schools as a place to &quot;improve&quot; society, and they wanted to go behind the backs of the parents and mold the children.<br /> Over the years there has been a wide variety of programs, some of which have been a bit useful or effective, most have been destructive.  For example in the 1920s and 1930s there was a push to be efficient in education, and that by figuring out where children would be working as adults and giving them only the education they would need, the schools could be good use of resources.  There was a belief by some of the experts that students had little ability to transfer knowledge.  As an extreme example of what this belief mean, just because students had been taught the basics of addition, they would have to learn from scratch the basics of subtraction.  Because of this belief there was little interest in teaching children more than they really &quot;needed&quot; to know.<br /> The questions people asked about the purpose of education are good questions to ask.  It is helpful to know why children are going to schools.  The author clearly feels that many of the leaders of education make big mistakes, and millions of children have suffered from an inadequate education.  For example many people in the 1950s and 1960s felt that black children would grow up to have the menial jobs, so it was best to only teach them the basics; that it would be bad to try and force them to learn more than they would ever use.<br /> And on the flip side, in the 1980s many experts felt that self-esteem was the only thing that matter, once children had good self-esteem, they would learn what they needed to know.  So there were whole programs designed to help children have a strong positive self-image.  Out of these schools came large numbers of children with little knowledge, but they felt good about themselves.<br /> The author mentions program after program that were inflicted on children.  The author goes over some of the various types of damage the children suffered.  Then a group of education leaders would come up with a new program, lead another national movement, and a new group of children would suffer.<br /> This is a good book for anyone who is trying to understand the current set of problems schools in our nation are facing.  One of the fascinating things is how many of today's proposals have been tried in the past, and sometimes they have been tried several times.have suffered from an inadequate education.

For example here are some: Just who attacked the United States?  Will they attack again?  What do they want?  How do we need to respond?<BR> In &quot;Militant Islam Reaches America&quot; Daniel Pipes tries to answer some of these questions.  Daniel Pipes has about a dozen books on various facets of the Middle East.  He makes the distinction between &quot;Islam&quot; and &quot;Militant Islam.&quot;  He believes that &quot;Islam&quot; is not a threat to America or any Western Civilization, but that &quot;Militant Islam&quot; is a very, very serious threat.  <BR> The author traces Islam through history and mentions how for a long time that the religion of Islam was practiced by members of powerful civilizations, but that over the last couple hundred years most of the countries which practice Islam have fallen behind the Western World economically and politically.  Part of the Militant Islam response is from people who want to make their contries powerful again.  They are trying to use Islam to impose their will on their countries, and on other countries.  <BR> In many ways Militant Islam is more like Socialism or Communism.  Those behind it are more concerned with power and trying to make other people follow them.  The author points out that while we did lose several thousand people in the terrorist attacks on September 11th, Militant Islams are killing dozens and hundreds of Moderate and Traditional Islams each week.  <BR> Daniel Pipes mentions case after case where Militant Islams will not tolerate differences of opinions.  They expect to win arguements more from their willingness to inflict violence than to show the rightness of their beliefs.  For example there is evidence that the records written a hundred years after Muhammad may not be an accurate statement of what the Prophet Muhammad taught.  But when scholars or priests try to explore the evedience,the Militant Islam response is to threaten violence.<BR> Daniel Pipes says one of the best things the United States can do to effectively fight Militant Islam is to support the Moderate and Traditional Islams, and help them to defend themselves.<BR> In his research the author has come to the conclusion that there are only a few tens of thousands of extremists who want to kill Americans, and are willing to die doing so, but that there are tens of millions of Militant Islams who do want to force other Islams, and the rest of the world, to follow their version of Islam.<BR> The author spends the second half of the book talking about Islam and Militant Islam in America.  Most Moderate and Traditional Islams are happy to be in America, and are useful productive members of our society.  Militant Islams have said time and again that they want to change America to become Islam.  The author mentions how many times when the police arrest someone who has broken the law, that if the person is a member of Militant Islam, the rest of the Militant Islam community rallies around them.  Or when the media reports unfavorablly news on Militant Islam, the community of Militant Islam will harass, try to intimidate, or even file law-suits.<BR> The author says America does need to defende itself internally from Militant Islam, but it doesn't really need any new laws or organizations.  We just need to enforce the laws, so that when Militant Islam breaks the law, they are put in jail. <BR> From the book the answers to the questions above are:  Militant Islam has been attacking America for years.  They will continue to try to force America to become more Islam.  They want power.  We need to be aware of them, and to support Moderate &amp; Traditional Islam.<BR> Overall the book is easy to read.  The author writes well.  I found it fascinating and informative.	2003-12-19

Recently he become very aware of just how biased the New York Times is and decided to document how it reports the news in a bias manor.  <BR> The author says the true debate is not about media bias, but news bias, how the news is reported.  The whole focus of this book is to document how the New York Times now reports its opinions as news.  Along the way it teaches the reader how to be more critical when reading the news and how to read between the lines.  <BR> Since all major papers subscribe to the New York Times News service, the NY Times greatly influences what is considered news, and how to report the news.  <BR> The old style reporting was very focused on:<br />I have six honest serving men;<BR> They taught me all I knew;<BR>Their names are Where and What and When;<BR> and How and Why and Who<BR>  by Rudyard Kipling<br /> In reporting news, a journalist would often use the &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; style, where you put the most important details first.  A good news story tries to answer Kipling's six uestions, and tries to answer them at the beginning, in the lead sentence.  By only reporting one side in the lead sentence a journlist can easily slant the news story.  Most people don't read past the first paragraph on a lot of stories and are left with the impression from just the first paragraph.<BR> According to Bob Kohn most modern newspapers seem to see their mission now as influencing public opinion.  The Times distorts the Facts by omission, distortion, falsification, and emphsis.  The author goes into example after example of how they do this.  The Times will often include the opinions of others in the stories when the opinions agree with the Times, or not in include them when the opinions disagree. The Times uses positive labels for those it likes, and negative labels for those it hates.<BR> The author uses the book as a call to action for the New York Times, he asks them to keep their opinions in the opinion section and just report the facts.<BR> I found the book well written, and educational.	2003-12-04

The authors start off saying that many people negotiate some where along a spectrum of easy or hard negotiating, either they are willing to get along and often may give up something they really want, or they will push and push for what they want.  The authors say it is better to stay back and figure out what is a fair deal for both sides.  For example in buying a car you would look at what other people are paying for a similar model and number of miles.  Or in getting a job the salary should be competitive with other people with similar backgrounds.  The key point is to try and find ways to decide if an agreement is fair.  <BR> The method is basically:<br />1) Separating the people from the problem<BR>2) Focusing on the interests, not positions<BR>3) Inventing options for mutual gain<BR>4) Insisting on using objective criteria	2003-08-14

This book can make a big improvement in how effective you are in reading.  It mostly focuses on how to master a book.  It talks about various levels of reading, but mainly the book is trying to help the reader to completely understand and own a book after reading it.<BR> A reader or listener is like a catcher in a baseball game, it takes both the effort of the pitcher (author) and the effort of the catcher (reader) to transmit an idea.  In reading only in part, only part of the idea may be caught. <BR> The goals of reading: reading for information, reading for understanding.  To gain understanding you have to work on the book.  Reading for understanding is aided discovery.<BR> The authors point how that there are different levels of reading:<br />1) Basic reading  (See Spot run)<BR>2) Reading with a limit on time, systematic skimming.<BR>3) Reading for maximum understanding, or unlimited time<BR>4) Reading several books, synoptically, this is the ability to do research from several books.<br /> So in reading a book you need to decide what it is you want out of the book.  For example you may decided after skimming the book that you are not interested in reading any more.  &quot;HOW TO READ A BOOK&quot; gives tips on making that decision, and then how to do a good job of reading at a given level.  <BR> The authors give tips on how to skim a book, to check the title page, the table of contents, look through the index, and read the publishers jacket.  At some point along the way you may decide you are no longer interested in the book.  Next you figure out which chapters are important to the book, read them, and read the summary arguments of the book.   <BR> Much of the book is on the third level, where you try to own or master a book, so but the time you are done with the book you have increased your understanding of a topic.<BR> The essence of active reading, trying to answer four basic questions:<BR>1) What is the Book about as a whole?<BR>2) What is being said in detail, and how?<BR>3) Is the Book true, in whole or in part?<BR>4) What of it?  What does it mean to me?<BR> There are several suggestions on how to mark up a book, so that when you come back to it later you can quickly remember the key points, and use it as a reference book.  And marking up the book helps you to process the material at a deeper level.<BR> This is well worth reading, and reading several times, until you own the book.	2003-08-13

It was kind of a surprise to find that the set we had was very different from a single copy of the second reader we had.  So I was curious about the history of the Readers.<BR> Basically a couple of businessmen in the west (being Cincinnati at that time) contacted McGuffey and asked if he would create some readers.  Up until then most of the readers were from New England.  McGuffey got paid $$$$$ and he collected selections for the first four readers.  The last two were put together by his younger brother.  Then over the years there were several revisions done by other people.  I think the last main revision was done in 1879.  The first editions were very, very religious.  Over time the subsequent editions still pushed character issues like honesty, hard work, but didn't talk about God as much.  <BR> All total something like 120 million copies of the readers were published.  Several generations were raised on the McGuffey Readers.  They become the reading curriculum for the whole nation.  The decline in American education at the same time John Dewey was pushing to get people off the McGuffey Readers in the 1900 to 1930 time period.  <BR> The author says we don't know much about McGuffey's ancestry, or his childhood.  He was one of eleven children.  He married at 27 and had 5 children with his first wife.  The three boys died young, one was a month old, one was about a year old, and one was sixteen years old.  His wife died, he remarried and lost one more child.  He appears to have been very strict as a parent and as a teacher.<BR> Even as a college professor, and a part time minister, he made time to investigate how to teach children how to read.  He would gather neighborhood children together and try different selections on them.<BR> There is a lot of speculation in this book on what McGuffey believed.  <BR> At many schools the first two readers were enough to teach people how to read.  One central theme of the original McGuffey Readers was that God was the creator.  <BR> The book was OK, the stuff about McGuffey was fascinating.	2003-08-07

It is written for elementary children, but it is not a simple book.  It is full of interesting facts and relevent information.  I was very impressed with just how much detail there was in this book.<br /> This book is the first volume, it starts off with wandering nomads and moves to the last Roman Emperor.  All along the way the book talks to the reader and asks questions, to get the student thinking about what life might have been like thousands of years ago.<br /> The book covers civilizations around the whole world, with a focus on Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Greece, and Rome.  The author gives a good feel for what life might have been like in ancient Egypt, or other civilizations.<br /> Even though it is written for children, I found it a nice quick summary.  There were many things I hadn't known before.	2002-11-01
