I never quite believed Lord Scarecrow and Jack could be real (whereas I'm still convinced Lyra and her Daemon are out there somewhere from \\"His Dark Materials\\").  It's always a bit of a disappointment to not become so engrossed in a book, the characters become real.  However, that's about the only disappointment.<br /><br />Lord Scarecrow and his turnip head (though I kept picturing him as the scarecrow from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\") is anxious to seek his fortune and rescue his birthplace from being polluted.  On their tail is a lawyer working for the Buffalonis, the polluting family, who reminds me of Count Olaf.  Poor Jack just wants to stay alive and not be hungry.  In between are many adventures including a desert island, joining the military, which all leads to a climactic courtroom scene.<br /><br />A great fairy tale for the preteen set (and us older preteens as well).	2005-10-13

Loosely based on real-life ancient history, this book is a feast for young imaginations with glimpses of past Assyria (the modern day Middle East), Egypt, and hieroglyphics.  The book is educational as well as entertaining.<br /><br />A fairly short book that won't overwhelm younger children (artistically stimulating for the pre-reader), but also keeps us old folks visually engaged.	2005-10-13

Very absorbing and deep.  She truly takes you into her world with words and imagery.<br /><br />\\"Inkspell\\", as with it's predecessor \\"Inkheart\\", is a love for both books and reading.  Many of this book's characters are also characters in the book in their own universe.  The characters that come to life for us also come to life in the book.<br /><br />A slightly confusing concept to explain.  Nevertheless, it's a wonderful fantasy aimed for a slightly higher age group (12 and up).  I was happy to learn that this is only the second book in a Trilogy.  There's one last installment planned.	2005-09-23

After reading the book, I felt like I'd been shredded to pieces as well.<br /><br />Very thought provoking and moving.  Whether an addict or someone close to the addicted, the emotion of this book can be related.  A heart-breaking story, one that won't soon leave your memory.	2005-09-23

Liam Aiken (Klaus of \\"Lemony Snicket\\") will be playing Matt Cruse.  Emma Watson (Hermione of \\"Harry Potter\\") will be playing Kate De Vries.  A couple of really good child actors.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the sequel to this story, \\"Skybreaker\\".	2005-09-21

There's something bizarre about wanting to know more about the famous.  This book tells the most macabre of all - how more than 100 famous people died and categorizes them by their 'type' of death.<br /><br />The book also gives bits about these famous people's lives both professional and private.<br /><br />Death - the one great mystery we can't solve until we've actually been there.

Especially with the famous.  Maybe their book spoke to us, their movie drew us in, their words or ideas captivated us.<br /><br />There's something mysterious and serene about graveyards.  It's the one great mystery we can't solve until we've actually been there - death that is.  It's comforting to know we won't be the only ones experiencing it.	2005-09-21

It's written as a children's book, but this is no book for kids.  There's some pretty scary stuff and rather harsh language as well (he dropped a few f-bombs and the 11 year old main character was molested).  Young adults, maybe.  Kids, definitely not.<br /><br />The language of the kids reminded me a lot of the kids in the movie \\"Mad Max : Beyond Thunderdome\\".

I'd recommend them for anyone 12 and up. There's a bit too much violence for the younger set.	2005-09-18

I'm as big a fan as the next kid of Harry Potter on the edge of my seat awaiting each new installment. So while I'm waiting, it was good to find Jenny Nimmo's Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy. Another boy going to another school not solely comprised of wizards, but with enough of them to make it seem so. While the series may seem clone-like, I still think it's fantastic for the slightly younger wizard in your household. They're much easier to read with simpler story lines, but still have enough pull to keep the youngster enthralled.<br /><br />This is the fourth book in the series which also includes Charlie Bone and the Time Twister, Midnight for Charlie Bone, and Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy.	2005-09-18
