Fine. OK. <br />I'm not silent. I'm speaking out. I claim that I cannot remain <br />silent. True or not (that I must-not, ought-not, should-not stay <br />silent), fact remains that I am not silent. The silence does not <br />exist. It's not going on. What IS going on is the speaking out. <br />You ask me (why) to give you a reason FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T <br />EXIST (my silence). There isn't any silence going on, and you're <br />telling me to explain the WHY of the fact that it doesn't exist. <br />?How come there isn't any silence? Yes, I can say WHY speaking <br />out makes sound/waves, since the sound exists, and since sound <br />has a source (my mouth or typewriter). As to having to give the <br />'reason' (why) for something that doesn't EXIST (silence), I do <br />not have a way to 'explain'/answer your why with a justification <br />of the existence of something (silence) that does not exist. The <br />word why presupposes that something exists (the silence, or the <br />ability to remain silent), and that another ought to 'explain': <br />why can't you (whatever), or why isn't there (silence/whatever). <br />How can something that doesn't exist have a reason for it's NON- <br />existence? Fine and dandy that you should tell me to shut up or <br />that I ought to speak out, but for you to expect me to 'explain' <br />(the cause behind something that never happened) is to ask me a <br />real word 'why' in a phrase that has an equally real word 'not'. <br />Why not? I could be there like Ralph Kramden all day. I cannot. <br />Why not? Red flag. Instead of trying to answer/justify something <br />that doesn't-exist/never-happened, the comment (not a reply to a <br />faulty question) could either be an explanation of why there IS <br />a speaking out or why one SHOULD remain-silent/continue-to-speak <br /> <br />I think that a more logical or suitable title for a revised book <br />would be something like 'Why One Should/Must Speak Out', or else <br />'Why Remain Idle When There Is Work to be Done'. The WHY invites <br />an explanation of something or some activity/condition that IS, <br />not non-existent. Q.: Why didn't you? A.: What? Better that the <br />challenge be YOU OUGHT TO or YOU SHOULD be able to (an opinion). <br /> <br />Satan tries to screw up logic by using the word IF about things <br />that DON'T EXIST. When you then try to answer a question having <br />IF as a presupposition, you talk about something nonexistent. It <br />doesn't exist. Never did. Ain't gonna. And yet IF makes it real. <br />Re-read Genesis 3, Matthew 4, Luke 4. IF 3x. Unreal like Why Not	2005-09-14

As political philosopher and <br />enlightened spiritual master, Deganawidah has bequeathed <br />a model for peace and spiritual harmony that is especially <br />relevant in today's chaotic world. <br /> <br />EXCERPTS:  <br /> <br />Peace was not, as they conceived it, a negative thing, the <br />mere absence of war or an interval between wars, to be <br />recognized only as the stepchild of the law; <br />To the Iroquois, peace was the law. <br />Peace (the Law) was righteousness in action, <br />the practice of justice between individuals and nations.  <br /> <br />The words of the Peacemaker: <br />The land shall be beautiful, <br />the river shall have no more waves, <br />one may go everywhere without fear. <br />(from the Introduction by Chief Leon Shenandoah--Tadodaho) <br /> <br />Additional reading on Peace as a reflection of divine order <br />can be had by reading the following humble 32-page booklet <br />ISBN: 0895552175 (put the 10 digits in amazon.com Search). <br />Another source (online, for free) can be found by entering <br />fatima.org/essentials/requests/plan.asp and scrolling down <br />fatimacrusader.com/crrosnov/toccrrosnov.asp to see the List. <br /> <br />In anticipation of military conscription (the draft) in USA, <br />one could do well to PREPARE notarized statements about CO: <br />objector.org/coclaim.html An ounce of prevention is worth...	2005-08-31

Why a <br />westerner shopping on amazon.com should consider a living avatar <br />vis-a-vis the #1 cause of cancer? Because by having a divine view <br />of mundane matters (debatable premise, admittedly: sathyasai.org) <br />He can point out from His perspective aspects which we would not <br />consider to be important. In this case, it is the BONES that stay <br />within the refined sugar after the process of chemically removing <br />'impurities' from raw cane (or beet?) that are the number 1 cause <br />of cancer. He mentions that tobacco and poluution come a distant <br />second in being causative agents. The bone particles are present <br />even in so-called brown or turbinado sugar, which is white with <br />some molasses added back. He suggests the alternative JAGGERY to <br />sweeten meals without the refined sugars. There's one point which <br />He typically inserts as a test of backbone: one must decide if a <br />sweet tooth is more important than one's long-term health. I add <br />myself that we can exist without factory sugar (uncivilized folks <br />got along fine without it before white sugar became essential), & <br />sugar supposedly FEEDS cancer cells that seemingly exist (double <br />whammy), whereas OXYGEN supposedly kills cancer cells. Forgive me <br />for throwing in those last two unverified tidbits; nevertheless, <br />since they seem to directly affect cancer cells (feed/kill), and <br />since most folks CAN take control over how much sugar and oxygen <br />enters their system, it seems to me to be worthwhile to tell you. <br /> <br />I regret the say that I haven't the citation from Baba; he stated <br />the connection between cancer and (refined) sugar in 1981, and it <br />appeared in a (very difficult to find online!) 'Summer Showers'. <br />What astonishes me is that devotees of Sai Baba commonly KNOW of <br />this cause-and-effect, yet nothing is being done to spread word.	2005-07-23

Look Forward is a management approach to CI that fosters an environment that infuses CI into the very fabric of the organization. As a result, improvement is not an initiative or a project but rather a natural occurring event that is anticipated, expected and prevalent. Look Forward is not a substitute for Six Sigma, Lean or Theory of Constraints (TOC), but rather is a necessary complement to each of these in order to assure self-perpetuating improvement that is ingrained in the corporate culture. It, in turn, needs Six Sigma, Lean and TOC methodologies to be the fuel for the improvement engine that drives the company forward. Any business serious about improvement is going to consider Six Sigma, Lean and TOC in the overall scope of their operations and the unique benefits they bring to the table. This book shows that for unbeatable sustained improvement, Six Sigma, Lean and TOC need to be intertwined with the Look Forward methodology.   <br /> <br />Key Features:  <br />Helps you build a foundation within your business that will support a robust improvement management method  <br />Includes an overview of Lean, Six Sigma and Theory of Constraints and how they can be used together by management for constant improvement  <br />Provides the mechanics of the day-to-day execution of a synergistic continuous improvement management method  <br />Features several case study examples that you can use to relate to your company  <br />Promotes a corporate culture that will foster on-going, perpetual improvement throughout the organization without the necessity of intervention  <br />  <br />About the Author(s):  <br />Robert Dirgo has over twenty-five years experienceworking in the steel and aerospace industries. Mr. Dirgo is currently Manager of Process Quality Assurance at Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation (ABSC). As one of the overseers of the continuous improvement effort, he was also one of the original management members that developed the Look Forward management method in 1996. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Master's degree in Statistics and has been certified by the American Society of Quality as a Certified Six Sigma Black Belt, a Certified Quality Engineer and a Certified Quality Auditor.   <br /> <br />Table of Contents:  <br />Look Forward - How to Manage the Business of Improvement <br />Your Industry Standard - A Framework for Look Forward Improvement  <br />Six Sigma <br />Lean Manufacturing <br />Theory of Constraints <br />The Challenge of Maintaining Continuous Improvement <br />Look Forward - The ABSC Way <br />Look Forward Case Studies <br />Enterprise Level Improvement Initiatives <br />Conclusion <br />Bibliography <br />Glossary <br />Appendix <br />Index	2005-06-12

Carothers <br /> <br />Better than I attempt to review what should be hands-down A BUY, <br />being that the author has <br />- a rich lifetime experience <br />- isn't at ALL stuffy (no way, even for a layman versus preacher) <br />- has the gift of the Holy Spirit to genuinely inspire/lead him <br />- wrote other books in similar positive, honest, and USEFUL way; <br /> <br />allow me to quote an excerpt from his Chapter One: <br /> <br /> <br />The Specter of Fear  <br /> <br />     Fear lurks in the silent darkness, unwanted - hated. It's power is so great that even when ignored or denied it can still control our destiny. <br />     My first parachute jump was a lesson in sheer terror. The Airborne instructors had vigorously indoctrinated me to believe that I was a tough paratrooper, impervious to fear. Yet I was still afraid. <br />    Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \\"Do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain.\\" This adage is often true, but I was afraid during my second jump too. I didn't know it then, but my hard lessons in living and coping with the more insidious aspects of fear had just begun. I still had much to learn about fear's enormous capacity to influence our behavior. <br />    We arrived at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1943, two hundred robust, cocky young men from all over the United States. The rigors of infantry basic training were behind us;  now we were ready to confront a new challenge - Airborne training. <br />     The grueling physical training we had endured prior to coming to Jump School had, we thought, separated the men from the boys. We were the elite of the Army, we boasted. We could do anything! We eagerly awaited our chance to show the Army what real men were. <br />     Were we afraid? No way! We were embarking on a new and exciting adventure. <br />     The sergeants who greeted us at the bus terminal were seasoned Airborne veterans. They had once been green horns like us; they knew our attitudes. The process of ego pulverization was fierce and immediate as they rushed upon us like voracious sharks attacking minnows: <br />     \\"Pick up those bags, you chicken-livered mama's boys, and let's go!\\" <br />     Mama's boys? Sergeant, you don't know who you're talking to. We aren't afraid of you or anyone else! <br />     How wrong we were. <br />     The sergeants had one primary objective - to separate the men from the boys. In their less-than-humble opinion, the men were those who would never give up despite injury, suffering - even torture. <br />    In infantry basic training we had learned to run, or so we thought. But at Airborne School we never just went for a run. All we ever did was run, run, and run some more. Anytime we moved it was on the run. We ran to the latrine. We ran to chow. We ran to training sites - five, ten, or more miles. Finally we reached such a high level of fitness that we could run for hours on end without tiring. Failing meant, heaven forbid, washing out of the glorious Airborne. <br />     But running was fun compared with the rigors at the training sites. At one site we were suspended from harnesses like those that would connect us to a parachute from which we would descend from plane to ground. The harness straps, holding our dead weight and digging into our groins, felt like thin wires straining under two hundred pounds of agonized flesh. <br />   We hung in those harnesses while the sergeants explained, at length, the fine art of being a \\"famous paratrooper.\\"  <br />    \\"Do you hurt, mama's boys? Want to quit?\\" <br />     \\"Quit? No Way!\\" <br />     The worst thing that could happen to a sergeant was for one of his mama's boys to freeze in the airplane door - refuse to leap into space. His plan was to weed out any trainee who had the potential to quit, and the earlier the better. We trainees were convinced that the sergeants got a bonus for every one of us they could make a washout. None of us wanted to quit,but the sergeants, it seemed, had stronger wills. After the first grueling week our group of 200 had decreased to 150. <br />    Before each disgraced washout departed we were lined up by the truck that would transport him to some unknown, abominable site for a truly awful assignment. The sergeants themselves led us in jeering the miserable failure. This harsh tactic was used to make those of us who remained that much more determined not to be quitters, and never to be afraid. <br />    At the end of the second week 125 of us remained. We ended preliminary training acutely aware that the lowest level to which we could ever sink was to be a washout. So far, so good. We were fearless; we were the aristocracy of the elite. At least that's what we wanted to believe. On the morning of our first parachute jump, our barracks echoed with jubilant shouts of \\"Geronimo!\\" <br />    The worst was yet to come. <br />    We returned to our barracks in triumph that evening, brimming with gusto. We had made it! We had successfully completed our first jump. Only four more jumps and we would earn the coveted silver wings of the full-fledged paratrooper. Nothing could stop us now! <br />   But we noticed that our number had shrunk from 125 to 120. What had happened to the others? We learned that they had been injured. One had broken his leg, but he would recover. Another had broken his back. No one had mentioned that possibility during our training. <br />    The next morning we were a bit less enthusiastic about our upcoming jump We tried to muster a show of bravado, but none of us could forget the man who had broken his back. A sergeant lined us up for another lecture: \\"Yesterday one of this group of stupid little boys failed to do what he was taught. He will not jump again. While preparing to land he was so scared that he looked down at the ground rather than straight ahead as you were all taught. He broke his back. If anyone else wants a broken back, do the same thing.\\" <br />That evening several more of our comrades failed to return to the barracks. Fear set in. It had become clear to us that our chosen occupation wasn't all fun and games. Two men went AWOL. They couldn't face the humiliation of the \\"quitter's parade\\". <br />    On our fourth jump, three men froze with fear at the open door of the plane, refusing to make the plunge into space. They were treated with the most disdain of all. That evening they were paraded before us and derided as the most contemptible examples of cowards that three mothers ever brought into the world. The rest of us vowed that we would never permit ourselves to be so vilified. <br />    On the morning of our fifth jump there was an oppressive silence in our barracks. If anyone had asked, \\"Are you afraid?\\" we would have shot back, \\"Afraid? No!\\" And we would have been sincere. Each of us reasoned, \\"I haven't quit. Therefore, I'm not afraid.\\" It was the quitters who had been afraid. However, if an animal with a keen sense of smell had been nearby, it would easily have detected the fear that we so stubbornly denied. <br />     I made it through the five qualifying jumps without a scratch. Had I been afraid? Yes indeed! But I had learned to deny my fear, and finally I stood triumphantly with my comrades as our commanding general pinned the silver wings on my chest. I was now a member of the Army's most elite society of warriors. There was no reason to be afraid now. That is, not until my next leap into space. <br /> <br /> <br />Got you interested?

Young superstar athletes have dispelled long-standing misconceptions that strength development should start in the late teens. But much discussion has continued regarding what type of training is most beneficial.  <br /> <br />Strength Training for Young Athletes provides all the answers as the authoritative guide to strength development for 7- to 18-year-old athletes. World-renowned strength and conditioning experts William Kraemer and Steven Fleck present the latest facts on the effects of strength training on growth, development, and performance. The authors then make recommendations relative to starting age, choice of exercises, frequency of training, rate of progression, and philosophical aspects of program design. <br /> <br />Learn how to individualize the age-appropriate sample training programs provided, based on the athlete's physical, psychological, and emotional maturity as well as the demands of the sport. Such carefully designed programs not only improve athletic performance and prepare young athletes for higher competitive levels, but they also help to decrease the incidence of injury along the way. <br /> <br />Strength Training for Young Athletes is the most complete and credible resource for developing the muscular foundation for athletic success.  <br /> <br />About the Author <br />William J.

Should tape not <br />be available already pre-recorded ISBN: 0553525689 <br />then order the audio Compact Disc ISBN: 0553456121 <br />and transfer the audio CD's sound to a cassette. I <br />tell you this NOT to waste your precious time but <br />to enable you to better access specific portions <br />of the audio book ON TAPE, rather than trying to <br />pinpoint a part (paragraph or sentence) on CD. On <br />audiotape cassette (either copied from the CD or <br />somehow obtained as an original Random House tape) <br />you can fast-forward or replay tidbits (which tape <br />allows but CD does not). This is applicable to all <br />books (and music) on tape versus CD, not just this <br />title. I believe that the ability to instantly <br />REPLAY a given sentence (or phrase/word) by going <br />BACK on audiotape is more effective/efficient than <br />when one must be limited to the cues or tracks of <br />a CD. <br />Hope I helped somebody out there.	2005-04-11

As physician and leading health researcher Dr. Neal Barnard explains in this groundbreaking book, banishing these cravings is not a question of willpower or psychology-it's a matter of biochemistry. <br /> <br />Based on the author's research and that of other leading investigators at major universities, Breaking the Food Seduction reveals the diet and litestyle changes that can break these stubborn craving cycles. Using everyday examples, questionnaires, and practical tips, the book delivers: <br /> <br />o Fascinating new insights into the chemical reasons behind your cravings <br />o Seven simple steps to break craving cycles and tame your appetite <br />o Important advice for kids' sugar cravings and how to halt them <br />o A three-week kickstart plan <br />o One hundred delicious, satisfying recipes that help your body break the spell of problem foods and put you on the path to weight loss, better health, and greater well-being. <br /> <br />This accessible and practical book is essential reading for anyone who wants to lose weight, lower cholesterol, feel more energetic, and get control of their health once and for all. <br /> <br />This reviewer would like to add a tidbit of health/diet-related <br />information which is not well-known, yet which is rather timely <br />---&#62; Although sugar merely rots teeth and does not cause cancer <br />it is the bone ash IN sugar (left in sugar during the refining) <br />that is the #1 cause of the various kinds of cancer. Tobacco & <br />pollution take a back seat to the BONES in factory sugar as far <br />as cancers go. Without actually buying a bag of commercial food <br />(sic) sugar, look for the ingredient(s) statement. You probably <br />won't see a disclosure of the plant from which the refined food <br />is made (cane or beet). It's what they DON'T tell you that very <br />likely might do you in... Keep in mind that most brown sugar is <br />made from white sugar with some of the molasses added back. For <br />a bone-free sugar, look into jaggery (mentioned by Sai Baba) or <br />perhaps (whole-grain) rice syrup (Mizuam or Am in Japan). Sai <br />Baba says that you've got to decide whether your sweet tooth is <br />more important than your health (& consequently forego refined <br />white sugar). The bones do not add to taste appeal: they whiten <br />the finished product. <br /> <br />2 additional books to do with the enticing appeal of sugar are <br />038000903X (and various earlier editions) &#34;Body Mind and Sugar&#34; <br />0446343129 (paste this into the Search) &#34;Sugar Blues&#34; by Dufty. <br /> <br />In case you don't mind consuming honey (not a vegan foodstuff), <br />look for UNHEATED honey (right on the label). Raw does not mean <br />unheated. The beneficial living enzymes in natural honey don't <br />continue to be viable once the honey has been heated (cooked). <br /> <br />Were you to have a home-made (simple, uncomplicated) meal with <br />steamed vegetables (and no, not from the can) and zero sugar, I <br />venture to say that you'll get a mellower high in your brain, a <br />feel-good comfort-food after-effect that has no side effect of <br />crankiness or irritability (which it seems sugar does produce). <br />On a day off from work when you can afford to live dangerously, <br />have a bowl or plate of steamed vegetables (preferably without <br />tomatoes and eggplant; potatoes OK, with the skin left on) and <br />perhaps either whole-grain stone-ground bread* or plain noodles <br />(spaghetti w/o tomato sauce,linguini w/ garlic that YOU press) <br />and (only if you already have incorporated home sprouting into <br />your weekly routine) a handful of mustard or alfalfa sprouts. <br />Rather than guzzle water like there's no tomorrow, intersperse <br />single MOUTHFULs of water (distilled costs no more than spring) <br />whenever your stomach indicates that you're sending down overly <br />dry food. Finish your (day off) meal with a SINGLE nap; set the <br />alarm for the maximum that you can afford to be 'gone'. I'd say <br />to set the alarm for a full two hours AND WEAR (soft) EAR PLUGS <br />to further ensure an anxiety-free nap. Whether or not you sleep <br />the full time before the alarm goes off, get up THE FIRST TIME <br />that you wake up (even without the alarm). That's the time when <br />your brain will get the druggy effect from your earlier meal of <br />steamed vegetables. The insurance of having an alarm clock lets <br />you totally relax and really get into the nap, since the alarm <br />will rouse you in case you travel beyond this solar system). RH <br />* -the store-bought bread oftentimes sneaks in various sugars; <br />try to find an outlet for day-old organic bread withOUT sugars; <br />the retail cost of yuppie-quality organic bread means that you <br />are better off either slow-baking your own OR buying it 'stale'	2004-12-24

The failings of the criminal justice system and the use of the death penalty in this country are currently under close scrutiny and an important topic of public debate. The images and voices of The Innocents mark this historic turning point in America.<br /><br />The Innocence Project, founded by leading civil rights attorneys Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, is responsible for most of the postconviction DNA exonerations in the United States today, many of which are included in this book. On the ten-year anniversary of its founding, the Project continues to free the innocent, striving to transform criminal justice into a more equitable and reliable system.<br /><br />Photographer Taryn Simon brings us face-to-face with individuals falsely accused and convicted. While mugshots and photoarrays are used to condemn and imprison these innocents, Simon has turned the camera around to document these victims of mistaken identity and perverted justice. Simon photographed the wrongfully convicted at locations that were crucial in these legal cases: the scene of misindentification, the scene of arrest, the alibi location, or the scene of the crime. Through Simon's interviews with each, the men and women in this book confront the paradox of innocence and imprisonment, the inability to recover the years stolen from them, and the states' unconscionable refusal to compensate them or ease their traumatic transition to civilian life.	2004-12-08

Review to the book (printed) version of Saints Alive (ISBN: 0927383004):    'This book is a compilation of remarkable classes Hilda gave at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York City -- classes in which she spoke with love, wisdom and humor of the saints and holy people who were a living part of her life. The book also includes practical lessons for living a life of truth, courage, and love.'   -HildaCharlton.com website    'When Hilda talked about saints, she began with a gushing enthusiasm I would normally associate with a teenage girl conteplating her latest heartthrob. Almost imperceptibly her tone alternated from one of girlishness to a solemnity manifesting the holiness of the saints' lives to the jocular familiarliy of a next-door neighbor. Only gradually,subtly, and with the utmost concentration did it dawn on me that she herself was one of them.'   -Danny Goldberg, recording industry executive    Table of Contents:    Chapter  1.

Do not look out. Light a blessed candle, which will suffice for many days. Pray the rosary. Read spiritual books. Make acts of Spiritual Communion, also acts of love, which are so pleasing to Us. Pray with outstretched arms, or prostrate on the ground, in order that many souls may be saved. Do not go outside the house. Provide yourself with sufficient food. The powers of nature shall be moved and a rain of fire shall make people tremble with fear. Have courage! I am in the midst of you. <br />FEBRUARY 7, 1950 <BR>Take care of the animals during these days. I am the Creator and Preserver of all animals as well as man. I shall give you a  Few signs beforehand, at which time you should place more food before them. I will preserve the property of the elect, including the animals, for they shall be in need of sustenance afterwards as well. Let no one go across the yard, even to feed the animals--he who steps outside will perish! Cover your windows carefully. My elect shall not see My wrath. Have confidence in Me, and I will be your protection. Your confidence obliges Me to come to your aid. <br />The hour of My coming is near! But I will show mercy. A most dreadful punishment will bear witness to the times. My angels, who are to be the executioners of this work, are ready with their pointed swords! They will take special care to annihilate all those who mocked Me and would not believe in My revelations. Hurricanes of fire will pour forth from the clouds and spread over the entire earth! Storms, bad weather, thunderbolts and earthquakes will cover the earth for two days. An uninterrupted rain of fire will take place! It will begin during a very cold night. All this is to prove that God is the Master of Creation. Those who hope inMe, and believe in my words, have nothing to fear because I will not forsake them, nor those who spread My message. No harm will come to those who are in the state of grace and who seek My mother's protection. <br />That you may be prepared for these visitations, I will give you the following signs and instructions: The night will be very cold. The wind will roar. After a time, thunderbolts will be heard. Lock all the doors and windows. Talk to no one out side the house. Kneel down before a crucifix, be sorry for your sins, and beg My Mother's protection. Do not look during the earthquake, because the anger of God is holy! Jesus does not want us to behold the anger of God, because God's anger must be contemplated with fear and trembling. <br />Those who disregard this advice will be killed instantly. The wind will carry with it poisonous gases which will be diffused over the entire earth. Those who suffer and die innocently will be martyrs and they will be with Me in My Kingdom. <br />Satan will triumph! But in three nights, the earthquake and fire will cease. On the following day the sun will shine again. angels will descend from Heaven and will spread the spirit of peace over the earth. A feeling of immeasurable gratitude will take possession of those who survive this terrible ordeal -the impending punishment- with which God has visited the earth since creation. <br />I have chosen souls in other countries too, such as Belgium, Switzerland. Spain, who have received these revelations so that other countries also may be prepared. Pray much during this Holy Year of 1950. Pray the Rosary, but pray it well, so that your prayers may reach Heaven. Soon a more terrible catastrophe shall come upon the entire world, such as never before has been witnessed, a terrible chastisement never before experienced! The war of 1950 shall be the introduction to these things. <br />How unconcerned men are regarding these things! which shall so soon come upon them, contrary to all expectations. How indifferent they are in preparing themselves for these unheard of events, through which they will have to pass so shortly! <br />The weight of the Divine balance has reached the earth! The wrath of My Father shall be poured out over the entire world! I am again warning the world through your instrumentality, as I have so often done heretofore. <br />The sins of men have multiplied beyond measure: Irreverence in Church, sinful pride committed in sham religious activities, lack of true brotherly love, indecency in dress, especially at summer seasons... The world is filled with iniquity. <br />This catastrophe shall come upon the earth like a flash of lightning! a which moment the light of the morning sun shall be replaced by black darkness! No one shall leave the house or look out of a window from that moment on. I Myself shall come amidst thunder and lightning. The wicked shall behold My Divine Heart. There shall be great confusion because of this utter darkness in which the entire earth shall be enveloped, and many, many shall die from fear and despair. <br />Those who shall fight for My cause shall receive grace from My Divine Heart; and the cry: \\"WHO IS LIKE UNTO GOD!\\" shall serve as a means of protection to many. However, many shall burn in the open fields like withered grass! The godless shall be annihilated, so that afterwards the just shall be able to stand afresh. <br />On the day, as soon as complete darkness has set in, no one shall leave the house or look from out of the window. The darkness shall last a day and a night, followed by another day and a night, and another day-- but on the night following, the stars will shine again, and on the next morning the sun shall rise again, and it will be SPRINGTIME!! <br />In the days of darkness, My elect shall not sleep, as did the disciples in the garden of olives. They, shall pray incessantly, and they shall not be disappointed in Me. I shall gather My elect. Hell will believe itself to be in possession of the entire earth, but I shall reclaim it! <br />Do you, perhaps, think that I would permit My Father to have such terrible chastisements come upon the world, if the world would turn from iniquity to justice? But because of My great love, these afflictions shall be permitted to come upon man. Although many shall curse Me, yet thousands of souls shall be saved through them. No human understanding can fathom the depth of My love! <br />Pray! Pray! I desire your prayers. My Dear Mother Mary, Saint Joseph, Saint Elizabeth, Saint Conrad, Saint Michael. Saint Peter, the Little Therese, Your Holy Angels, shall be your intercessors. Implore their aid! Be courageous soldiers of Christ! At the return of light, let everyone give thanks to the Holy Trinity for Their protection! The devastation shall be very great! But I, Your God, will have purified the earth. I am with you. Have confidence! <br />(Here ends Padre Pio's Message)	2004-05-31

Quite simply, it's the best book on trial advocacy ever written.\\"<BR>-Zachary Weiss, Senior Investigative Counsel, New York County District Attorney's Office<br />Description<br />NITA's best-selling text, Modern Trial Advocacy: Analysis and Practice, has set the standard for trial advocacy texts since 1993. All NITA's renowned full trial programs use the text, as do prominent law schools nationwide. Steven Lubet guides the beginning advocate from developing a winning case theory through all phases of trial. He explains how to present a case as a story, and how to tell the story to the jury powerfully and persuasively.<br />Since its initial publication, Lubet significantly enhanced the book in 1997 and now he revises it again to include a new chapter on the most recent revolution in trial advocacy: technology in the courtroom.\\"Electronic Visuals,\\" the new chapter by Edward R. Stein, provides a useful and insightful introduction to technology in the courtroom, ranging from evidentiary issues to practical advice. The new edition also includes updates to Federal Rules 702 and 703.<br />Modern Trial Advocacy contains separate sections on case theory, witness examination, making the record, and talking to the jury; a comprehensive discussion of case theory explaining how to test and develop alternate trial strategies; a portion of each chapter addressing ethics concerns as they arise in practice; and a unique chapter on persuasion theory describing how the principles of cognitive theory can be used to capture the jury's imagination.<br />Modern Trial Advocacy presents a realistic and contemporary approach to learning and developing trial advocacy skills. Lubet writes in a clear, concise style that is attractive to both the beginning advocate and the experienced trial lawyer. And, most importantly, this book offers a sophisticated theory-driven approach to advocacy training that distinguishes it from other books in the field.<br />Summary of Contents<br />Each chapter includes a thorough discussion on preparation, analysis, techniques, and ethics.

It describes evangelism as a process and helps readers understand how their skills and God-given gifts can easily be used to draw customers, clients, and coworkers to new life in Jesus Christ.<br />Description<BR>How to take evangelism out of the religious box and weave it into your life at work<br />Going Public with Your Faith: Becoming a Spiritual Influence at Work flies in the face of almost everything you've ever read or heard about evangelism. Forget mechanical, aggressive styles of witnessing that treat evangelism as a one-time event. Real evangelism is a process. It's organic-a lot more like farming than selling.<br />In every part of the world, people are looking for spiritual answers and resources as never before. But you don't need to travel to some exotic foreign mission field to find hungry hearts. You spend hours every day in the most strategic place of impact in the world-your workplace. <br />Going Public With Your Faith offers a proven model for evangelism that respects the unique relationships you have with your coworkers, clients, or customers. It shows how you can be authentic instead of artificial when sharing what you believe, build trust with even the most skeptical person, and cultivate caring connections with those who have not yet come to a saving faith in Christ. <br />If you've ever wanted your life to count for the kingdom, \\"Going Public with Your Faith\\" will show you how your God-given gifts and talents can easily and naturally draw customers, clients, and coworkers to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.	2004-02-17

In Her appearances at Fatima, the Mother of God solemnly promised us final victory over the forces of evil in our own time. &quot;In the end, My Immaculate Heart will triumph,&quot; She told us, &quot;the Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me. Russia will be coverted and a period of peace shall be given to mankind.&quot; <BR>Because the warnings that Our Lady gave the world at Fatima are so stern and terrible, many have mistakenly characterised Her Message as &quot;apocalyptic.&quot; Yet at the heart of the Fatima Message is the promise of peace which the Blessed Virgin offers to all men and women of faith and good will. In both its simplicity and its universality, Our Lady's Message is an unique Heaven-sent opportunity for all people everywhere to work for a real, lasting peace in our homes, churches and nations.<br />&quot;If people do what I tell you, many souls will be saved and there will be peace.&quot;<BR>Our Lady's Peace Plan is founded on THREE simple, but powerful requests. The FIRST is a request for prayer, most particularly the Holy Rosary and the devotion of the Brown Scapular. The SECOND calls for us to make reparation for the sins and outrages perpetrated against God's Grace and blasphemies against the Holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary. The THIRD request is for consecration tothe Immaculate Heart of Mary, both on a personal basis and, publicly, that of Russia (and Russia specifically) by the Pope and all the world's bishops. <br />PRAYER. Each time the Blessed Virgin appeared to the three children at Fatima, She repeated Her requests that we pray the Rosary each day. In the final vision, on October 13, 1917, Our Lady silently held out the Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel as a sign of Her desire that we undertake this great devotion. In fact, Sister Lucy has stated that &quot;the Scapular and the Rosary are inseparable.&quot; Emerging from faith, prayer becomes the unshakeable foundation for peace in Heaven's plan for our salvation. <br />REPARATION. At Fatima, Our Lady told the seers that Our Lord is much offended by sin and declared that &quot;people must amend their lives and ask pardon for their sins.&quot; She also told them that She would return later to ask for a new devotion of reparation in order to save souls. True to Her word, on the evening of December 10, 1925, She and the Child Jesus appeared to Sister Lucy in her convent cell in Pontevedra, Spain. Showing the young nun a Heart encircled by thorns, Our Lady told her to announce to the world in Her Name that she would assist, at the moment of death, all those who, on the First Saturday of five consecutive months confesssed, recieved Holy Communion, recited five decades of the Rosary and spent fifteen minutes meditating on the mysteries of the Rosary with the intention of making reparation to Her. Arising from hope, this great devotion of the Five First Saturdays now unites millions of hearts in an unbroken chain of reparation for sin and atonement for offenses against the Hearts of Jesus and Mary. <br />CONSECRATION. To consecrate is to make holy, to dedicate to God and to declare as sacred. Our Lady's Plan for Peace is a call to both personal and public consecration. In accordance with Holy Gospel, the Mother of God asks each of us to consecrate our lives to Her Immaculate Heart, letting it become our gateway to Her Son, Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. At the same time, Our Lady also asks the Church to publicly acknowledge Her divinely-appointed rôle as the Mediatrix of all Graces and Queen of Peace by consecrating Russia (and specifically Russia) to Her Immaculate Heart in a public ceremony by the Pope and all the world's Catholic bishops. &quot;By this means,&quot; She promises, &quot;to convert that poor nation&quot; and bring peace to the world. Speaking to Sister Lucy, Our Lord has confirmed that it is His intention that this great public act shall glorify His Blessed Mother's Immaculate Heart throughout the world. Deriving as it does from charity or selfless love, the act of consecration is the single most important element in Our Lady's Plan for Peace.<br />Speaking to Sister Lucy, Our Lord has said: &quot;I wish My Church to...put the devotion to this Immaculate Heart beside the devotion to My Sacred Heart.&quot; The Plan for Peace which Our Lady announced at Fatima is, in essence, an effort to unite the hearts of millions with those of Herself and Her Divine Son, the union of which is the very source and wellspring of true peace in the world. <br />St. James the Apostle has written that he who can do good and does not, does evil. Our Lady has given us a simple Three-Point Plan to bring peace to our families, to our nations, to our communities and to the entire world. She asks so little, yet promises so much. Join us in working for the great triumph of Her Immaculate Heart and the peace of Heaven that is promised through the Grace of Her Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ.<br />May I suggest that you order more than one copy?<BR>The cost of the second copy is negligible, and it lets<BR>you keep your own reference copy while you lend one out.	2004-02-16

I apologize<BR>for not using proper grammar and for omitting citations for<BR>this claim. I had much trouble to resurrect the pdf page that<BR>gave the word-for-word precaution/disclosure about sugar's<BR>danger vis-a-vis cancer(s). I do remember that it dates from<BR>1981, and that it was neccessary to scroll to almost to the<BR>end/bottom of the Acrobat page to read the few paragraphs on<BR>the connection between sugar and cancer. Baba did offer the<BR>simple alternative of &quot;jaggery&quot;, which is UNrefined, and has<BR>NO bone residue within it to cause cancer. Brown sugar isn't<br />suitable, being that usually that stuff is made from white<BR>sugar with some molasses added back. Do a search via engine<BR>for 'jaggery' and you'll come up with various links. Honey<BR>is twice as sweet as sugar, so one could get by with half as<BR>much in a recipe that calls for sugar, YET I'd still try to<BR>omit same. Unless the label reads &quot;unheated&quot; (not raw), it's<BR>been cooked, and the enzymes have been heated to death(or<BR>whatever is the appropriate terminology).<BR>I hope that by this review I have alerted some readers to an<BR>ADDITIONAL reason to order the A L Gittleman user-friendly<BR>guidebook on ridding one's cupboards and fridges of s-u-g-a-r.	2004-02-15
