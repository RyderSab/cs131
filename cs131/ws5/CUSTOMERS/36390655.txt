Still, these stories are actually pretty scary.  They are presented as if a group of people were telling ghost stories late in the evening.  Some of them deal with the guillotine; one of these features a great use of irony, even if it is a bit predictable.  All of the stories are masterfully macabre, and I found that they became increasingly more compelling as I continued to read them.	2005-06-22

This book of stories from his childhood provides a great context for learning about Cross Creek, and fans of M. K. Rawlings will find lots of insight into her place in the community.  Glisson, himself, is a fine writer.  He has great insights into life in Cross Creek, and his commentary provides a good understanding of some of the contemporary values and mores that continue to shape Florida's culture.  There are also some interesting subtexts in the book.  For example, Glisson affectionately gives the scoop on Rawlings.  He modestly provides some specific references to himself in her writing, but after reading this work, I'm convinced that the character Jody in _The Yearling_ is modeled to a great degree after Glisson.  He is also very funny.  More than a few of the stories had me laughing outloud.	2005-06-21

In many parts of the South, and among many Floridians, the name \\"cracker\\" carries with it a lot of negative connotations.  Within the past 30 years, however, a certain \\"Florida Cracker Chic\\" has emerged, and in many communities being cracker is now seen in a much more positive light.  Dana Ste.Clair provides a good historical sketch of the term \\"cracker,\\" and he looks at interesting aspects of cracker history and culture.  I especially liked the sections on cracker cowhunters and the discussion of cracker folkways.  The book also includes some vivid historical photographs, excellent illustrations from 19th century magazines, interesting excerpts from books and articles about Florida's rural communities, and a list of contemporary living history sites where one can experience a sense of Florida's cracker folklife.  The book provides a good, balanced discussion of both the positive and negative aspects of cracker history, and Ste.Clair sympathetically looks at people who were cracker when being cracker wasn't cool.	2005-06-07

Lincoln notes \\"For those of you who like this kind of a book, this is that kind of book you will like.\\" The tautology rings true! What kind of people might like this book? If you're interested in the history of log cabins, Erbsen provides an interesting historical context for these types of buildings. He cites current authorities in vernacular architecture and even critiques some of the myths of the log cabins. He replaces the inaccurate ideas about log cabins with good information about the cultural context that supported these constructions. There is good information about cabin-raisings, ways that musicians \\"fiddled up a cabin,\\" and the various construction techniques used in a range of buildings. The book provides special attention to ways in which log buildings continue to provide important themes within old-time fiddle tunes, ballads, and bluegrass music. The book includes the words and music to a number of ballads and folksongs, and readers will also appreciate the way that Erbsen included mountaineers' proverbs, folk-speech, and even recipes. I also like the presentations of clever tall tales, legends, and other narratives that pertain to the life of those who lived in these types of houses. Even though Lincoln wasn't born in a log cabin that he built with his own two hands, the book does provide a good understanding of the types of cabins that Lincoln actually lived in. It even includes some of the actual ballads that he sung as a youngster. As Lincoln stated, this book will appeal to people who like this kind of book: namely, those with an interest in the folklore and history of rural America.  <br />	2005-01-01

Wayne Erbsen has previously written on bluegrass and old-time, but this book updates and embellishes earlier work.  Erbsen begins by providing an engaging historical overview of the various roots music traditions that contributed to contemporary bluegrass styles.  He explains how the string band music of North Carolina, Tennessee, and other areas form a foundation for Bill Monroe's later contributions, thereby affirming both Monroe's important role in developing the genre while also acknowledging the sources that Monroe drew from in crafting his own style.  I especially like the biographical sketches of major musicians such as Snuffy Jenkins, Bradley Kincaid, Eck Robertson, the Coon Creek Girls, the Blue Sky Boys, and other artists who may not be as well known.  Erbsen's introduction to the basic instrumental and vocal techniques used in bluegrass will appeal both to musicians who want to learn to perform in this style as well as to listeners who simply wish to develop their musical ear.  The book includes lyrics, melodies, chords, and historical background on nearly 100 old-time, gospel, and bluegrass songs.  The music is presented in an accessible and engaging way, and Erbsen's clear writing style sets a great tone for encouraging  novices who wish to learn the tunes.  The book also includes an excellent and extensive presentation of photographs of musicians and a good list of resources for further reading and listening.  Having all of this information in one volume that is a pleasure to read is a valuable resource for anyone interested in American music.	2004-12-30

The book appeals to fiddlers, and it also provides violinists interested in old-time tunes with sufficient resources to begin playing in styles different from classical music.  The large selection of music  provides great versions of mazurkas, waltzes, hoedowns, reels, jigs, hornpipes, airs, marches, and numerous other genres.  Although the focus is on tunes commonly played by old-time fiddlers in the USA, the selection is international in scope, and the book includes tunes from Scotland, Ireland, America, Canada, and other countries.  Each tune is annotated with a description of where the tune originated and a listing of various musicians who recorded the tune.  These annotations will be especially helpful for musicians interested in the history of fiddling and for fans who wish to hear how the tunes sound prior to learning them from the printed page.  The book should appeal to fiddlers of all skill levels; there are simple tunes for beginners as well as more numerous tunes that are a challenge for more advanced players.	2004-07-11

Tuleja describes examples of folkloric traditions that are part of everyday American life.  Each entry includes information on the historical context and meaning of each custom.  It's written in an accessible style, and the book is interesting both to browse through and to read as a reference source.  Tuleja includes an extensive bibliography for more information.  The book does include material of interest to trivia buffs, but the book also includes discussion of serious topics.  Some of the entries include speculations that are a bit thin and simplistic, but the overall work encourages readers to think about the history and significance of common traditions.	2004-07-11

Charles Colcock Jones compiled these folktales during the late 19th century.  He developed much of his compilation based on the memory of stories that he heard as a youth growing up in the Deep South.  He had a good ear for the Gullah creole, but the book shouldn't been seen as a completely accurate rendition of the language.  The book is now reissued with an excellent introduction to Gullah culture and Jones' original compilation work.  The stories, themselves, are really interesting, entertaining, and poignant to read.  With a careful reading, the reader develops a greater familiarity with Gullah, and the stories becomes a resource for appreciating the beauty of Gullah.  In this way, the stories and the Gullah speech interanimate each other.	2004-07-06

Thursby's book provides a fine overview of Basque settlement in the United States, and she uses this historical context to provide understanding of important forms of folklore in present day Basque cultural expressions.  The major portion of the book is an overview of genres and forms of folk culture from areas with large populations of Basques.  She provides special attention to the importance of women's contributions to the preservation and adaptation of this ethnic group's folklore, and she concludes her study with a thought-provoking and well presented analysis of the group's traditional culture.  Many of her insights are useful for comparing and contrasting Basque traditional culture with the folklore of other ethnic groups in other regions, and Thursby's writing style is accessible and interesting.	2004-07-06

John Millington Synge's book demonstrates that this quest for authenticity has been an important part of cultural inquiry for a long time.  This wonderful book was written almost one hundred years ago, but it reads like a contemporary ethnographic inquiry.  He provides vivid descriptions of daily life and wonderful presentations of the folklore of the Aran Islands.  The book is primarily descriptive, but there are interesting textures and conclusions throughout Synge's writing.  I would recommend reading this book and then watching Flaherty's film \\"Man of Aran.\\"  Follow up that visual feast with Stoney's \\"The Making of the Myth.\\"  To complete your excursion, top things off with a reading of Synge's \\"Playboy of the Western World\\" and \\"Riders to the Sea,\\" two fine plays that he set on the Aran Islands.  The stories, descriptions, and textures within Synge's book will become very clear when you're finished.	2004-07-05

The regional culture of this area is rich in a variety of folk expressions, and McGregory's book provides a great overview of the area's traditional culture.  One of the book's strengths is the grounding of her study in environmental interests.  She includes a particularly important discussion of the time-honored practice of controlled burning of the wiregrass.  This practice had been common in the area until a misplaced environmental sensibility called it into question.  The result was severe damage to the ecosystem.  McGregory's discussion of ways in which this traditional activity has been denigrated, misinterpreted, and called into question provides a valuable caveat against enforcing well-intentioned policy without first understanding traditional culture within its ecological contexts.  In addition to her discussion of ecology, other topics in the book are equally interesting, and the author provides resources to connect folklife in the area to subjects such as local history and cultural geography.	2004-07-05

Much of the material is from archives and earlier studies, but the authors bring the material to life through a discussion of the storytellers who told the tales.  The book provides a good introduction to the storytelling traditions of the Scandinavian countries.  Tales are indexed to tale types and motifs thereby providing good resources to connect the tales to other compilations of international folktales.

Ives began hearing stories about the song's writer, and he began a research project to find out more information on Joe Scott.  What's remarkable about this book is that Scott had died long before Ives had met him and Scott wasn't particularly famous.  Consequently, Ives used oral history interviews and folklore study to discover a wealth of information about Joe Scott.  This biography is such a vivid portrait of the singer that I felt that I had met him personally after reading this wonderful book.	2004-07-01

The &quot;Old Hag&quot; consists of a belief that a person is stunned by supernatural forces and ridden by a ghost, witch, or other supernatural being in the night.  He became interested in the unified way in which people described eerie nightmares that froze people with fright.  Hufford discovered that the experience was shared by people who had never even met, thereby challenging the idea that &quot;The Old Hag&quot; was merely a folk belief passed along in an oral tradition.  The book provides an excellent way to understand belief from the point of view of a person who accepts it as part of reality.  It also provides interesting ways to think about ways to reconcile belief with science.  Finally, the book adds great insight into beliefs in alien abductions.	2004-06-28

The book includes interesting discussions of ways to use oral sources when doing historical research, and the author provides useful ways to ascertain the validity and usefulness of these types of resources.  His methodology includes ways to assess the historical accuracy of various stories, and the book also demonstrates how to interpret less verifiable stories to gain an understanding of social attitudes and cultural values that emerge in storytelling traditions.

The chapter on folk music in Arkansas is especially good, and the discussion of genres and musicians from the Arkansas provides a fine introduction to the topic of traditional music in general.  Arkansas, in particular, has a rich legacy of important contributions to American folk music, and the thorough discussion of Arkansans' contributions to old-time, blues, gospel, and country music is remarkable.

The book has interesting information about both the relatively well known as well as fairly obscure musicians to provide a good background on typical biographies of blues players.  The stories are fascinating, and Pearson presents the texts in the raconteurs' own words as much as possible.  The stories show typical themes and characteristic patterns in the players' lives, thereby providing useful ways for understanding the historical and social contexts for the music.  The book provides a great base for learning about the blues, and its value as a historical document will only increase over time as we lose more of the blues musicians' whose lives are sympathetically represented in this work.  The gaps in this type of research are increasingly being filled by more biographies of women in the blues and more famous players, but this book is remains an important resource for thinking about music in relation to life history.	2004-06-09

The book is a detailed study of chain carving, and the description is so thick that a reader could actually learn to carve a wooden chain by reading this study of an popular folk art.  What makes this book so interesting is the way in which Bronner connects the carvers' biography with woodcarving to ascertain important values within the carvers' lives.  Throughout the book, Bronner uses folkore scholarship to provide important insights into ways in which an individual's early life experiences provide a base for creativity during the twilight years.

She has arranged this book as a social history that stretches back to slavery times and extends into contemporary history.  There are continuities and variations in the stories, but the overall themes remain the same.  Mainly, the stories provide ways to understand how the history of racial tension in America is expressed through folklore and fantasy.  In this respect, the book provides interesting ways to read the legends for psychological insight as Turner provides an interesting discussion of ways in which ideological constructs become expressed in fantasy.	2004-06-08

Although the mumming tradition had died out by the mid 20th century, current residents who remembered the mumming tradition describe what one might experience when celebrating a typical evening of the old tradition.

There is a great range of topics, here, including Mardi Gras, New Orleans jazz funerals, antebellum home tours, Scottish Highland games, powwows, and numerous other festivals.  Each article can stand on its own, but the entire volume also provides a good study of regional culture and how various ideas of heritage are expressed in public.	2004-05-18

The approach provides ways to ascertain salient features in the areas' contemporary culture that are derived from different, yet similar, historical backgrounds.  Blaustein uses this analysis to demonstrate ways that folklore and literary arts contribute to the revitalization of culture and community life.  Blaustein extends this argument to show that this type of revitalization is a creative resource for ameliorating psychological stresses and for unifying people politically to resist hegemonic forces in the wider society.  Blaustein's critique of critical theory and deconstruction of deconstructionism are especially important contributions.  This book is an important addition to post-postmodernist discourse, and it also serves as a great introduction to terrific writers from Appalachia and Scotland.	2004-05-10

The basic plot and the main characters do emerge upon a first reading, but the book needs to be read at least twice for one to see its richness.  I find it especially interesting to read _House Made of Dawn_ along with _Way to Rainy Mountain_.  Reading both books makes each of them clearer and yields a richer understanding of Momaday's artistry.  It also would be useful to read a great about Kiowa folklore and history between different readings of both books.	2004-05-07

It provides clear and interesting discussions of major rituals that form important components of their way of life.  The material is drawn largely from interviews with Black Elk, and the writing really explains significance of important details in the various practices.  The book also provides a good basis for understanding how the cultural practices fit into Lakota history.  This book is also a fine one to read in relation to &quot;Black Elk Speaks,&quot; &quot;The 6th Grandfather,&quot; and &quot;When the Tree Flowered.&quot;	2004-03-07

Throughout the book, Beisswenger also presents numerous interesting stories that Melvin Wine told to him during various interviews.  These texts provide a good understanding of fiddle traditions in Appalachia, and there are vivid discussions of house parties, public square dances, and contests.  Melvin Wine's life history is also interesting.  Like many fiddlers, Wine stopped playing for a long period of time but then decided to pick up the instrument once again.  Beisswenger explains \\"the missing years,\\" and the analysis provides insight into tensions between religious sentiments and the musical spirit.  The excellent transcriptions of Wine's complex playing round out this thorough study of a folk music tradition.  The author has a rich understanding of fiddling, and the transcribed tunes are excellent resources for understanding this particular style of fiddling.  The book is an excellent tribute to a great fiddler.	2004-02-15

He has such wide ranging interests, and his scholarship is thorough and fascinating.  This book is a collection of articles that show how he interprets folklore in relation to psychoanalytic theory and by piecing together ways in which folklore is part of a society's worldview.  The article on the number &quot;3&quot; in American culture is especially interesting as he charts out ways in which unconscious patterns about numerical sequences greatly influence everyday activities.  I also enjoyed his article on thinking ahead.  He demonstrates how so many aspects of American culture provide templates for imagining that we are living for a brighter and rosier future.  The book also shows how his main interest focuses on psychoanalytical interpretations of folklore and culture.  These are always intriguing reading although some  interpretations are stronger than others.  The great part about this book is that Dundes provides all kinds of ways to look at folklore to show how we can think about everyday aspects of experience to learn intriguing things about ourselves.	2004-02-15

Swann edited together stories from a wide range of regions within North America.  He included terrific introductions by excellent researchers and authors.  These introductions present sufficient background information to learn about the storytelling traditions, and the commentary helps readers understand and appreciate the texts.  There is also an extensive bibliography that includes hundreds of additional sources for learning more about the stories, storytellers, authors, and societies that are represented in the book.  The stories, themselves, are magnificent.  Some are fairly accessible to readers with little knowledge of American Indian history and culture.  Other narratives are more esoteric, and they must be read and reread with great patience.  As readers develop ways to read these stories, the wonder of the tradition lights up ways to think about the verbal artistry of America's first peoples.	2004-02-15

The intervention can be in the best interests of the community, or the intervention program can reflect primarily the goals and aspirations of the interveners.  It can have positive and negative effects, and the interveners frequently create unintended consequences in the host communities.  This important rubric provides a fascinating way to look at the impact of settlement schools and a folk festival in the mountains.  Whisnant's analysis is interesting and provocative and well-worth considering when one is working in a community.	2004-02-08

By looking at facets of design such as settlement patterns and the formal qualities of buildings, Vlach shows how patterns in material culture provide clues for understanding the patterns of history that one can read by examining the buildings.  This remarkable book not only documents plantation architecture as an important contribution to the historical record, but it also provides a fascinating interpretation of the subject.  It is an especially important study because of the dearth of written documents left by slaves.	2004-02-07

One of the world's best folklorists, Alan Dundes has compiled key texts in the study of mythology.  The  range of ideas and issues is excellent, and Dundes' headnotes  provide insightful and essential introductions to an array of theories about myths.  This volume is thoroughly grounded in serious scholarship, and it fairly presents a range of issues and approaches.  When Dundes offers criticism, it's done with intelligence and insight, and he provides ample evidence to back his claims.  Although the book works especially well as an introduction to theories of myth, this excellent compilation of articles should appeal to more advanced students of mythology.	2004-02-06

One chapter explains how material culture provides resources for studying history.  This idea is key to the study of archaeology, and Glassie demonstrates how to study objects to examine the recent past.  There is an vibrant chapter on the role of material culture in the life of a repairer of fine carpets who becomes a carpet seller in Philadelphia.  Two of the strongest chapters deal with pottery and vernacular architecture.  He provides fascinating insights into art by  comparing various pottery traditions as diverse as Appalachian face jugs to Hindu religious art in Bangaldesh.  The chapter on vernacular architecture is a tour de force that provides an overview of relationships between American history and architecture as well as useful ways to examine the built environment.	2004-02-05

Neil Rosenberg has performed bluegrass music for years, and his compelling writing thoroughly documents the genre's history.  Carl Fleischauer photographs  folk culture with a terrific eye for ways in which music is situated with communities.  There are vivid portraits of stellar bluegrass musicians and beautiful pictures of classic bluegrass venues during this formative time period.  It is especially interesting to see bluegrass music's &quot;look&quot; from 1967-1986 still remains a presence within the contemporary bluegrass music scene.	2004-02-04

John Vlach has a comprehensive knowledge of architecture, and he insightfully writes about the importance of barns and rural cultural landscapes as resources for studying history.  This new volume is an important resource for studies of rural folk culture as it provides studies of a great variety of barns and an array of approaches for learning about vernacular architecture.	2004-02-03

Milnes's discussion of the various folk traditions associated with fiddling is really interesting to read.  He has fine descriptions of house parties, square dance callers' patter, and a good variety of the folk beliefs associated with fiddle tunes.  The chapter on the ballad of Naomi Wise is especially good, and I also appreciated the chance to learn more about the dulcimer tradition in the state.  Prior to reading this book, I thought that the dulcimer was primarily a recently introduced instrument that became popular only with the 1950s and 60s folk music revival.  Milnes broadens that view and demonstrates that there has been an interesting and rich tradition of dulcimer playing in the Appalachians.	2004-02-01

The introduction to the book is well-written, and each section provides good background information on various characters and tale types.

While there are excellent tunebooks from a range of fiddle traditions, it is also important to have great collections of good tunes from individual states and regions.  This book is an important addition to the research on fiddling traditions that comprise an important part of American folk music.  The introductory materials in the book provide a fine understanding of the background of fiddle traditions in Kentucky.  Titon then presents the transcriptions of dozens of great tunes, and the book includes an audio CD to help provide a better understanding of old-time fiddling in Kentucky.

She writes with clarity and wit, and I especially enjoyed the way that she integrates the study of social history with an analysis of a contemporary foodways tradition.  It is especially rewarding to follow her interest in seeing how a seemingly simple event can be studied to discover significant meanings.  Her analysis can be applied to other types of community events that center around food preparation and consumption, and she provides useful ideas for discovering ways to document similar folklife events.  Although the intrusion of arcane academic arguments might put off the typical reader, the use of jargon is generally accessible, and the hip reader will enjoy Neustadt's clever subversion of the overemphasis on theorizing.

The gist of their critique is that the book represents more of the values and concerns of Foucault rather than an accurate and responsible history of mental illness.  Foucault's central argument that society defines sane and insane behavior is an old cliche in cultural anthropology.  Furthermore, recent advances in cognitive science and psychiatry challenge Foucault's position by affirming that mental illness is exactly that, namely, \\"an illness.\\"  Simply stated, there is so much cross-cultural evidence that certain psychiatric disorders are univeral and not, therefore, specific to cultures but biologically grounded.  Various mental illnesses have been verified biologically as illnesses in the same way that biologically illnesses are also recognizable as physical illnesses.  Foucault is sometimes touted as a \\"cutting-edge\\" thinker, but his ideas were dated before he wrote them down.  Erving Goffman's book \\"Asylums\\" is an earlier and far better treatment of the cultural dynamics of mental institutions, and Ruth Benedict argued (in 1930) that insanity is often a cultural construct rather than a physical malady.  The basics of Foucault's ideas can also be seen in the writing of Shakespeare, Cervantes, Montaigne, and other Renaissance writers--about 400 years ago.  The moral dimensions of Foucault's fraud are only now being explored, and this writer's currently trendy reputation is not likely to stand the test of time.  This book is a good example of ways in which trendy writing and intellectual fads can quickly be discovered to be mere cliches.  Intellectual dubiousness aside, the major problems with this tome deal with Foucault's romanticization of mental illness.	2004-01-19

She originally wrote this work as a play with Langston Hughes.  They had planned to call it &quot;Mule Bone,&quot; but the two had a falling out prior to staging the work.  The theater world's loss was actually the literary and folklore world's gain, and this book is a terrific study of black folklore from Florida and Louisiana.  The book has wonderful folktales and descriptions of rootwork, and once the reader becomes acclimated to Hurston's use of black English, it is a pleasure to read.  Hurston provided rich commentary by embedding the texts into a narrative about doing fieldwork in the 1920s.  It's worth noting that Hurston compressed the amount of fieldwork time in this book as she had spent much more time in Florida than she presents in this work.  It's important to keep these types of literary devices in mind when reading her  book as she includes lots of allusions, hidden meanings, and clever wordplays to develop fascinating commentary on folklore.	2004-01-18

Brady has personally handled thousands of hundred-year old recordings of stories, folktales, traditional music, and other performances.  She writes from a great familiarity with both the early recording technology and the material on the records, and she insightfully uses a range of research techniques and academic insights to demonstrate convincingly that the ability to make audio recordings has  significantly changed the practice of folkloristic and anthropological fieldwork.  Among the big changes that she documents are greater emphasis on listening to indigenous voices and a concomitant sense of increased ethical responsibility to the societies whose cultural traditions are documented.	2004-01-10

Reading this book on the ballad traditions of Prince Edward Island is a terrific way to learn about ballads and ballad singing.  Ives also crafts a fascinating story about his experiences doing fieldwork.  This narrative frame provides more than a memoir; it is a great base for understanding his analysis and interpretation of the songs that he studies.

Students find the book both practical and inspiring, and it is a tour de force of the best of folklore research.  Glassie's insights are more than relevant today for thinking through contemporary concerns about a range of important social and political concerns including what it means to foster healthy community life and provide honor and respect to old masters and stars.

It is an eloquent discussion of how to learn about American Indian history and culture by looking at the everyday activities, traditional arts, folklife, and rituals that are shared with the public.  Toelken's work challenges stereotypical and inaccurrate perceptions about Indians; more importantly, he shows ways to understand what other people have to offer when they perform their cultural traditions.  It is also beautifully illustrated with gorgeous photographs, many of them in color.  The book is written for both academic and non-academic audiences as an introduction into contemporary American Indian culture. I highly recommend this fine book written by an excellent folklorist.	2004-01-01

Each chapter is a thorough overview of various genres and eras of folk and popular music in America.  The central claim that most of what we perceive to be American music is deeply rooted in the music of America's southland is a strong one, and it adds to our understanding of connections between regional culture and history.  The excellent discography provides a terrific guide to important musicians and recordings, and the new information on Cajun, Zydeco, Norteno, and contemporary acoustic music update the earlier edition.	2003-12-20

The case studies are especially interesting and provide excellent ideas about major issues involved in coordinating public events.  The chapters on the state of anthropology, the controversy over the Enola Gay exhibit, and the future development of public programs are especially strong.  The writing will be useful to coordinators of events that display history, folklife, and culture to audiences, and the book will also appeal to anyone who attends festivals, concerts, museum exhibits, and other presentations of culture.	2003-12-06
