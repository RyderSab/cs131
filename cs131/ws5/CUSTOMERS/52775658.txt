I've read just about everything of MaryJanice Davidson's that I could get my hands on, the past year or so.  I like her snappy dialogue and her great characters.  I picked up Secrets vol 6 solely because of a Davidson story.<br /><br />I just wanted to warn other Davidson fans that this story is a lot darker than most of her stories, and includes a very disturbing scene of forced sex.  I like werewolf stories, in general, and I really liked \\"Derik's Bane,\\" the third in the series (just out as a full-length novel), but I found this one disturbing.  I found little about the hero to like (he was a little too alpha) and had a difficult time believing the heroine would develop any softer feelings for him.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the sensual type story, then this is probably a good anthology for you, as other reviews attest.  But if you're a Davidson fan looking for something like \\"Royal Treatment\\" or the \\"Undead\\" books, you may want to approach this volume with some caution.	2005-01-27

Let me say this up front -- \\"To Die For\\" is not a typical Linda Howard book.  This is a wonderful romantic comedy with a slight suspense element that works more as a plot device than anything else.  Stylistically, it most resembles \\"Mr. Perfect,\\" since Howard has tended towards straight suspense in recent years, but it's even lighter than \\"Mr. Perfect.\\"<br /><br />That said, I loved this book!  I read a lot of first-person romantic comedies, and this ranked up there with the best of them.  I was prepared to not like the narrator upon her introduction, but warmed to her quickly, and the hero is a good foil for her.<br /><br />Snappy dialogue, good romantic chemistry -- this has all of the ingredients of a good romantic comedy!  Congratulations to Howard for a successful transition to a different style.	2005-01-08

Fabulous!  &quot;Paid Companion&quot; returns us to the Quick of old, giving us charming characters, a neat little suspense plot, and a wonderful happily-ever-after!<br />I wasn't as big a fan of the Lavinia/Tobias books as I had been of the majority of the earlier Quick efforts, so it was with some trepidation that I went out and paid an egregious sum for &quot;Paid Companion!&quot;  Never fear!  I devoured this one in one day!  Elenora ranks up there with Harriet (&quot;Ravished&quot;) and Emma (&quot;I Thee Wed&quot;) as one of my favorite Quick heroines, and Arthur is honestly one of the more realistic, well-rounded heroes Quick has imagined.<br />I honestly found the supporting characters a bit less well-developed  than in some of Quick's best, and the mystery/suspense element lacked some depth as well.  Still, the main characters, and the development of their romance, more than made up for it.<br />All in all, a big five stars for this enjoyable romp in the classic Quick style.	2004-05-12

Some, I absolutely LOVE.  Others, I find the characters self-centered and annoying.  Luckily, &quot;This Can't Be Love&quot; is of the former variety.<br />All the characters in this book are extremely likeable (with the exception of those that aren't supposed to be!).  Both the major and minor characters are reasonably well-developed.  And this book is hilarious!  I laughed out loud while reading it.<br />Michaels also does a good job of developing the romance between Molly and Dom -- Molly especially really has to work through some issues.  Those issues are nothing new in romances -- something Michaels actuallly pokes fun at by calling Molly a &quot;textbook case.&quot;  Still, Molly's so much fun, and so loving, that you're rooting for her the entire time.<br />A great read I couldn't put down!	2004-05-03

Roberts is somewhat distinctive, in that most of her stories do not have as much of a dated feel to them, but are somewhat more up-to-date than re-releases from other authors.<br />In &quot;Partners,&quot; rival news reporters Laurel and Matt end up involved in a murder investigation after the a woman approaches Laurel with suspicions that her sister's &quot;accident&quot; wasn't an accident at all.  This was a decent story.  There's some biting repartee between the two, which adds an element of fun, and their attraction is steamy.  I enjoyed it, but thought it nothing particularly distinctive.<br />In &quot;The Art of Deception,&quot; renowned artist Adam Haines is invited to the estate of an eccentric artist, and sparks fly with the artist's daughter, Kirby Fairchild.  But does Adam have ulterior motives for his visit?  I didn't particularly enjoy the suspense element of this one, which was a bit unpleasant, and I didn't appreciate Adam's deception.  Luckily, for much of the story, the &quot;suspense&quot; takes a back seat to characterization and relationship development.  Kirby and her father are wonderful, charming characters, and I laughed out loud throughout this story.  Thoroughly enjoyable.<br />In &quot;Night Moves,&quot; famous celebrity Maggie Fitzgerald moves to a small town and ends up hiring landscaper Cliff Delaney.  Sparks fly between the two of them, but then the landscaping work uncovers a ten-year old skeleton, and tensions rise, both in the town, and between Maggie and Cliff.  This was the weakest story of the three.  The relationship development between Maggie and Cliff was weak, and Cliff was sort of a jerk to Maggie.  In addition, the &quot;mystery&quot; wasn't all that threatening, even at the end.<br />All in all, this is a decent collection of older Roberts stories, for her major fans.  If you're not a Roberts fan, though, or you're reading her work for the first time, you may want to stick with her newer stuff. I highly recommend &quot;Three Fates&quot; and &quot;Birthright.&quot;t a Roberts fan, though, or you're reading her work for the first time, you may want to stick with her newer stuff.

Alyssa's character is a bit more fleshed-out than Cooper's.  Cooper does an abrupt about-face midway through the book that makes him less than believable, although his actions towards Alyssa later in the book are tender and touching.  The secondary characters are great, though, especially Cooper's adopted pets.  The parrot Lafitte is especially hilarious, providing some needed humorous notes at times in the plot.<br />The pacing of the book seemed erratic at times.  Parts of the book dragged a bit, while in others I was amazed at the pace.<br />Still, I enjoyed this book a great deal. I laughed out loud at several points, and Cooper's final grand gesture is both touching and hilarious.  The characters were likeable, and Cooper's romantic gestures were sweet.  I was rooting for these characters, and wanted them to be happy.  I'm always happy to recommend a book with likeable characters that makes me laugh.	2003-11-13

It's nice to have a little laughter and light in life.  But rare is the contemporary that gives me both humor and depth.  &quot;Off Limits&quot; is one of those rareties.<br />From the cover, &quot;Off Limits&quot; sounds like a typical &quot;clash of the styles&quot; romance.  But Albert gives her characters great depth.  Emma initially comes off as cold. Nothing new in a romance there.  But Albert gives her a reason to be uptight, and allows her to thaw a bit without totally rewriting the character.  Bobby seems like a typical light-hearted clown of a contemporary hero, ready to &quot;lighten up&quot; our heroine.  But instead he's a deeply troubled man, fighting demons inside himself.  Emma and Bobby end up tightly integrated as characters, and their relationship has a lot of believability and depth.<br />Albert also does a good job of developing the &quot;mystery&quot; within the plot.  The mystery doesn't serve as a device to develop the relationship between the two, except as a case they're investigating as partners.  I always appreciate it when a &quot;romance&quot; author manages to integrate the plot tightly into the romance without making it a device.<br />Not only that, but this book has some great secondary characters, most notably Chloe (who also appears in an earlier book).  It would have been easy to draw her as more of a caricature, but she's given a great deal of depth as well.<br />I appreciated that Emma is portrayed as an everyday person, fighting self-esteem issues.  And I also appreciated that Chloe and Bobby, both very good-looking characters, took pragmatic views towards their own looks.  Bobby is good-looking, but that hasn't helped him find someone to truly love him.  I appreciated the detail in his development as a character.<br />Still, the book has some light-hearted moments.  It's definitely not a serious romance, although it's more serious than a lot of contemporary romances with similar covers.  Honestly, I don't really enjoy &quot;weepie&quot; romances all that much.  This wasn't one of those!<br />My only disappointment is that Albert does leave us one unresolved plot line, and it bothered me.  Whether it's the result of cuts or just a plot line left hanging, I wish something had happened with it.<br />All in all,  this was a smooth read, one I truly enjoyed reading.

But the variety out there was staggering!  My library had some very comprehensive sources, but mostly I found them intimidating -- too many options, too much information to sort through!<br />Then I discovered &quot;Perennial All-Stars.&quot;  I'm so covetous of this book that I went out and bought it, even though there's a copy available in my local library.  The book begins with a number of lists, the type of sun/shade they prefer, their flowering season, those that attract butterflies and birds, by flower color... this book's got a list for anything I could think of!<br />Then each of the all-star plants has two pages devoted to it. These two pages tell you where the plant prefers to grow, the ideal location for planting, some other recommended cultivars of the species, when and how to separate the plants.  Even better, each article includes a list of possible &quot;neighbor&quot; plants, which makes it much easier for a beginner to try and plan their garden.<br />The pictures accompanying each article are beautiful and helpful.  In most cases, they included a photo that managed to highlight both the leaves and the flowers, and the photo also managed to highlight the shape of the plant.  I had grown very frustrated with books that showed me close-ups of leaves or flowers, or the whole plant from far away, so that I had difficulty really &quot;seeing&quot; the plant.  Not so with this book!<br />I also appreciated the quality of the index, which not only included the &quot;common&quot; names and Latin names, but also references to the neighbor plants under the Latin name.  It's a great, comprehensive index that made it easy to locate the plants I wanted.<br />I'd combed through back issues of our local paper and found several articles in which local experts recommended plants for our area.  These experts all agreed with Jeff Cox!  All but one of the plants they recommended appeared in this book, and in most cases it was even the same cultivar!<br />If you're looking for a guide to an old-fashioned garden, or if you want a guide to setting up &quot;color-themed&quot; gardens, there are other sources out there for you.  But if you are starting out with gardening, or just want a spectacular reference source for the best hardy perennials out there, this is a great book to have.in this book, and in most cases it was even the same cultivar!<br />If you're looking for a guide to an old-fashioned garden, or if you want a guide to setting up &quot;color-themed&quot; gardens, there are other sources out there for you.

(Visitation, Book 1)	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Decent but nothing special	Every time a new Lori Foster book is released, I run right out to the bookstore to buy it.  Normally my anticipation is rewarded by fun, sexy, absorbing read.  But I was terribly disappointed with \\"Say No to Joe,\\" Foster's latest \\"Winston curse\\" book.<br />When we were first introduced to Luna and Joe back in \\"Wild,\\" they were very well-developed characters with very distinctive personalities.  One of my biggest gripes with \\"Say No\\" is that the book doesn't really present us with any of that distinctive personality.<br />On top of that, the secondary characters were a disappointment.  In many of Foster's books, she pulls in new secondary characters that she then uses as central characters in following books.  Normally, she does a great job of developing the characters, giving them a personality and a reason for being there.  Not so in \\"Say No.\\"  The secondary characters seem without a purpose, tacked on.<br />The book does give us a lot of what makes Foster good.  I think some of her fans will be happy with this book (some are, as evidenced by reviews).  But I found this book to be flat and lacking in distinction.  Foster is used to writing shorter, tighter, books, and I think it shows -- I think this book could have been trimmed into a more enjoyable, tighter read.<br />Don't get me wrong -- even Foster's most ho-hum offerings are still ahead of a lot of the romance market.  But, compared to many of her other books, where the plot and characterization are crisp and tight, \\"Say No to Joe\\" is a disappointment.  I'd advise all but the most devoted Foster fans to check it out of the library or pick it up used.	2003-08-19

Last year I read Donovan's &quot;Knock Me Off My Feet,&quot; and really enjoyed it a great deal.  I didn't learn that it was her first book until afterwards, and then I was even more impressed!  So it was with great anticipation that I greeted the arrival of &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot; at the bookstore.  And whoah, was my anticipation justified!  &quot;Take&quot; is a great contemporary romance, with wonderful secondary characters, a dog you just want to take home yourself, and a well-paced romance between characters you can really love.<br />I must admit it took me a few minutes to get into &quot;Take,&quot; but once I did, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  That's not to say that it's a perfect book... Donovan still does a much better job with characters and relationship development than she does with the whole &quot;suspense/mystery&quot; element.  Some of the book's &quot;coincidences&quot; are a bit too much to be believed, and the romantic development was so well-crafted that sometimes the whole suspense plot seemed tacked-on.  Not only that, but Donovan moves between Thomas' and Emma's voices a great deal, which can be confusing.  I wish the people laying out the book had put a bit of whitespace in whenever she switched, because it took my brain awhile to catch on.<br />Still, if you're into contemporary romances, especially ones with a sense of humor, you'll definitely want to &quot;Take a Chance on Me.&quot; (Bad pun, but I couldn't resist!)	2003-08-19

First as a top model, then -- secretly -- as a best-selling novelist.  She had had enough of the limeliight.  She swore she would have nothing to do with Bay Spencer.  She would not take the leading role in his movie.  She would not be a star.  And she would not be one of the women he used so casually and cast aside so brutally.<br />\\"But from the moment he appeared at her isolated Oregon beach house, his blue eyes flashing fire and ice, her resolve began to weaken.  And before she knew it, she had walked into his trap.  She loved him!  Had she hidden for so long behind a mask of indifference only to be deceived by a man who wore a mask of passion -- who would go to any lengths, determined to have his way?\\"<br />I picked this one up because I've been going through Kay Hooper's back catalog.  This, like many of her earlier works, is a category romance.  Many of her earlier stories hold up well to the test of time;  they are charming, whimsical, fun little reads.  This, however, is not one of them.<br />\\"Mask of Passion\\" is straight along the guidelines for early 80's romance.  Lots of passion and intensity, both good and bad, and very little of anything that I would describe as \\"love.\\"  There is almost-forced sex (\\"overcome by passion\\" -- bah), and lots of jealousy and misunderstanding.  It's not -bad-, but it is dated, and for anyone, like me, that has been raised on more modern sensibilities, it's a little tough to take.<br />A lot of Hooper's early works are worth picking up.  Along the lines of her recent trio of reprints, \\"Enchanted,\\" many of them are amusing reads worth a lazy summer afternoon.  This one, though, isn't really worth the money you'll pay for it.	2003-05-30

Although these stories were written in the mid-80's, they surprisingly don't seem dated at all in the way that so many 80's romance novels feel now (with the slight exception of the &quot;setup&quot; in &quot;Kissed&quot;).<br />All three stories are incredibly charming and witty, with fully realized characters, sweet romances, and enough &quot;magic&quot; to separate them from the crowded romance market.  I also didn't notice awkward prose or a lack of fully-realized style that you would expect with earlier works.  These are fine stories that stand well on their own, not just publishers rushing to take advantage of Hooper's popularity.  In fact, if the publishers hadn't been extremely open about this volume containing reprints, I don't think I would have guessed.<br />Not only that, but all three stories are strong.  When I get an anthology like this one, I always expect to like one better than the others, but in this case, the quality was maintained throughout the volume.  My only disappointment was reading in another review that Hooper never wrote any books about the Knights or Lennoxes from &quot;Kissed,&quot; or the incredibly charming Shannon family in &quot;Belonging.&quot;<br />This volume is going on my keeper shelf -- the humor and charm of these stories make it one that will be easy to read over and over again!	2003-04-30

Plot Synopsis: &quot;Jax Winchester watched Kelly O'Brien grow from a mischievously appealing 12-year old to a beautiful 16-year old.  He fell in love with her, but he was too old for her, and his own misgivings, the interference of Kelly's older brother, and a hideous 20-month imprisonment in Central America kept them apart.  Now Jax has come back for the woman he never stopped loving.  Except Kelly doesn't know why Jax disappeared, or believe that he's come back because he never stopped loving her.  So Jax has to convince her that they belong together.&quot;<br />When I first picked up &quot;Letters to Kelly,&quot; I didn't realize it's a reissue of an earlier book.  Now that I know, I can see it, to a certain extent, but I can also see all of the deep intimacy and emotionalism that Brockmann brings to all of her current, longer novels.<br />I enjoy Brockmann's &quot;SEAL&quot; books, but I read a lot of other types of books, as well, and to me, Jax is one of the best types of heroes.  He's loving, and persistent, but not insensitive.  He's definitely not an alpha male type, but he is tough and knows what he wants.  I appreciated his depth of character.  Brockmann gives Jax a snappy repartee with a character in a book he's writing, and while this might be confusing to some readers, to me it injected some much-needed humor into a tender, but in some ways deeply sad book.  Kelly is a good character, too, and Brockmann develops well her reluctance to be involved with Jax again.  In the end, though, Jax is a more interesting character.<br />Because the love story between them starts when she is 16, a few readers might be &quot;creeped out.&quot;  It didn't particularly bother me -- in fact, I found the development of their love quite beautiful -- but if you're squeamish, be warned.<br />Nothing in the plot of this book is particularly new or novel.  It's a typical romance plot where misunderstandings and a lack of trust cause a rift between two people who really love each other.  But Brockmann brings a depth of emotion to it that is fresh and lovely, and it sets this book apart from many genre issues.  My only issue is that the ending is wrapped up too quickly.  Brockmann falls prey to a typical problem with this particular plot: everything is all right immediately when the misunderstandings are resolved.  I wish she had brought the same development to the resolution as she did to setting up the problems.<br />All in all, I found this to be a stand-out read, especially for a reissue.

Donovan manages to write some of the better developed main characters I've seen in years.  In addition, the minor characters are accessible and attractive.<br />The romance between Audie and Quinn crackles with wit, heart, and sensuality.  Donovan gives us some great love scenes, as well as wonderful romantic development.<br />The &quot;suspense&quot; plot, however, stumbles a bit;  the motives and personality of the eventual villain aren't fleshed out well.  In addition, while the romance between Audie and Quinn is generally developed well, the final resolution doesn't quite have the punch I would have liked.<br />Still, this is a top-of-the-line contemporary romance with a great deal of wit and some very accessible characters.  Definitely recommended.	2003-01-13

Plot lines are left hanging, and if you have not read the Grayson's other books, you might feel a little confused by the actions of some characters.  In addition, those looking for a well-developed romance should not start here.<br />Still, this is a witty, appealing read for those looking for a fun, light read.  The characters are accessible, and it's cute to witness them &quot;falling in love.&quot;  The hero, especially, is immensely appealing.  The plot line (which concerns a wrathful goddess seeking revenge) moves along briskly.  In addition, there are some laugh-out-loud moments and some delightful surprises.<br />All in all, I don't know if this is up to the quality of the rest of the series.  But it's still an immensely entertaining read.  I'd recommend it for wit and originality alone.	2003-01-13

Unfortunately, the romance between the two isn't developed well, and I didn't particularly like the characters.  I'm a fan of light-hearted contemporary romances, and I read many of the releases that hit the market.  But I do like some emotional development to the characters, and this book didn't have it.<br />If you liked the first book in this series, you'll probably like this one as well.  It's a quick easy read that once again treats us to the eccentricities of small towns and their inhabitants.  But if you like a bit more emotional weight in your books, this probably isn't your style.<br />Instead of this fluff, I'd recommend Susan Andersen, Elizabeth Bevarly, Julie Kenner, or Jennifer Crusie, or even some of the genre romances by authors like Kate Hoffman and Kristin Gabriel.	2003-01-10

But sometimes the characterization seemed abrupt, and I found some of the twists of her relationship with Matt a bit unbelievable.<br />In addition, there didn't seem to be a real arc to the plotline of the story.  A villain is presented, but we see little of his villainy until the end.  A lot of the plot details seemed abrupt, and the writing seemed choppy.  The book didn't flow well for me.<br />All in all, I'd call this book an enjoyable but inconsistent read.	2003-01-07

The characters are well-developed, the romance seems believable, and there's enough suspense to hold it all together.<br />Zoe and Ethan are great characters, and complex enough to hold on to our interest.  Their romance is well-developed and believable, and Krentz manages to achieve a great deal of wonderful sexual tension between them.  In addition, the book doesn't have an aloof attitude towards its own characters, a weakness that has characterized a few of this author's books the past few years.<br />The suspenseful plot line is gripping and, for the most part, well-developed.  As with \\"Smoke and Mirrors,\\" I was a bit disappointed with the final solution(s), because there seemed little to no build-up to the eventual true villains.  In addition, there were almost too many small villains and not enough of a big one.  But the initial hook of \\"Zoe as wrongly-imprisoned escapee from corrupt asylum\\" is a great one and brings a lot of tension to the book.<br />All in all, a good, gripping read with all that we've come to expect from a Krentz book.	2003-01-03

There's instant heat between them, but then Claire's best friend gets Jason to agree to accompany her as his &quot;date&quot; to an ex-boyfriend's wedding.  Much confusion ensues.<br />The Claire and Jason characters are immensely appealing, and we're eventually given decent explanations for their actions.  But those reasons, especially for Jason, aren't given in time.  The plot seems muddled, sometimes lurching along very slowly, and sometimes moving almost too briskly.  The conflict between the hero and heroine comes about far too quickly, with very little development, and is cleared up almost as quickly.<br />Kelleher has given us some good characters, and the &quot;heat&quot; between Claire and Jason is written well, but the plot is far too uneven for me to recommend this book.	2002-12-03

She's living in the Big Apple where she's supposed to be meeting all kinds of single, gorgeous men. Instead she's spending too much time holed up at the cybercaf&eacute; writing about her fantasies - instead of living them out! But that's about to change....<br />Jay Wagner has been looking for a sexy woman like Amelia. And when he accidently reads her online sensual secrets, he knows she's the one for him. Through scanning her entries, he learns exactly how to touch her body and what words will make her scream in delight. It's the perfect fantasy relationship. Until reality intrudes...and Amelia discovers he's been snooping.<br />Jay seduced her body. Can he now seduce Amelia's heart...?<br />Amelia has led a sheltered life and is now extremely shy, hiding herself behind nondescript clothing.  Jay sees something within her, though, some hidden depths, and works to bring those depths out.  He doesn't realize, however, the impact that Amelia will have on him, or how his efforts can hurt as well as help her.<br />\\"Sensual Secrets\\" has great character and romantic development, with Amelia growing as a person as she gains in confidence.  As she does, Jay also grows as a person, confronting his own fears and weaknesses.<br />The eroticism is worthy of the Blaze line, although Amelia's fantasies are sometimes a little awkwardly written.  Jay's character is written in such a hot way, though, that his sexuality practically leaps off the page -- definitely a wonderful hero!<br />There are weaknesses here.  Jay's development isn't handled as well as Amelia's, and thus his sudden \\"growth\\" at the end isn't quite as convincing.  Amelia's shyness and reasons for hiding herself are explained but lack a certain believability.<br />Still, this is a great addition to the Blaze line, and is going on my \\"best of Blaze\\" list!Blaze line, and is going on my \\"best of Blaze\\" list!	2002-04-24

The trick to any Blaze offering is to combine imaginative erotic sensuality with decent romantic development.<br />In \\"Secret Games,\\" Maggie is the victim of a deep-seated commitment phobia resulting from her parents' divorce.  Sam's wanted her for a long time, but he's been relegated to the role of \\"best friend.\\"  When Maggie asks him to accompany her to a \\"romantic getaway\\" to help her \\"observe,\\" he sees his opportunity to show Maggie the possibilities between them.<br />London does a great job of developing the characters.  Sam is a wonderful hero, caring and sensitivity, and the long-standing relationship between Maggie and Sam gives a great basis for a relationship.  I also appreciated that Sam didn't rush the physical intimacy between them.  For him, it was just as important to develop emotional intimacy as physical intimacy.  That leads to wonderful romantic development.<br />The \\"Blaze\\" line promises some hot sensuality as well, and \\"Secret Games\\" lives up to that promise.  Most of this book is foreplay ... but what imaginative, wonderful foreplay it is!  In addition, London does a great job of giving us moments of laughter in with the sensuality.  Maggie's chastity belt dilemma is a classic!<br />Still, there are weaknesses here.  Maggie's parents' divorce is touched on but not really fully explained;  Sam's fear of being judged \\"boring\\" suffers from a similar problem.  In addition, the last little \\"helpful prank\\" by the hotel staff doesn't seem to really add anything to the plot development.<br />But, these are minor weaknesses.  London does a great job of giving us true emotional development by really showing us Maggie and Sam's thoughts.  And those thoughts are true and deep, without the shallowness that can plague genre romances.<br />This is going on my list of Best of Blaze!  Enjoy.	2002-02-28

She ends up in Vermont, her car the victim of a deer and a thunderstorm.  There she ends up working for cantankerous archeologist Delaney Caine.  Delaney knows she's hiding something, but not that she's a princess...<br />This is an old familiar plot -- princess hides out as &quot;normal person&quot; -- handled in the old familiar Roberts way.  Anyone who has read a lot of Roberts knows that she has a lot of stock characters, and sometimes it feels as if whole chunks can be taken out of one book and transposed into another.<br />Still, millions read Roberts for a reason.  Her writing is smooth and easy, and her characters are appealing and just complex enough to interest.  Camilla's story flows well, and Delaney is a marvellously charming curmudgeon (even if he's too young to be a curmudgeon!).<br />A good, smooth read that fans of Roberts will truly enjoy.	2002-02-06

Like many of Howard's earlier heroes, he is drawn to Michelle despite himself, and he takes a lot of that frustration out on Michelle.<br />Still, despite Rafferty's harsh nature, and Michelle's inability to resist him, this is a powerful story -- one of the better of her earlier works.

The trick to any Harlequin line is balancing the \\"theme\\" of the series (in this case, sensuality) with real relationship growth and well-developed characters.  Vicki Lewis Thompson manages to do this quite well in \\"Acting On Impulse.\\"<br />The main characters are both well-developed, and the relationship between them is given time to evolve.  While Trudy's desire to \\"experience\\" may be a little artificial, it's the all-important plot point that pulls in Linc, which makes it a bit more forgivable.<br />In addition, this book is steamy and hot and very very imaginative.  The fantasies that Linc and Trudy act out are wonderful and sensual.  In addition, Trudy's travails -- the problems she encounters trying to act out those fantasies -- make them a bit more believable and far more human.<br />Thompson once again proves why she is at the top of heap of believable, character-driven erotic romance writers.

Quick's &quot;Slightly Shady&quot; was somewhat of a disappointment for me; the characters and romance seemed almost incidental to the plot.<br />&quot;Smoke in Mirrors&quot; retreats somewhat from that aloof style, giving us good character and romantic development and appealing secondary characters.  In addition, the mystery here is well integrated with the characters.<br />Leonora is an agreeable Krentz heroine, with the loyalty and spunk we've come to expect.  Thomas is another brooding Krentz hero, complete with large scary (but appealing!) dog.

Sometimes she does a good job developing likeable characters and a believable romance, and sometimes her characters are trite and shallow, resulting in no firm basis for a romance.<br />&quot;Aftershock,&quot; I'm happy to say, is the best I've read of her work, and one of the better Temptations I've read in the past couple years.<br />Amber and Dax are great characters.  Amber's very controlled and unemotional, but we're given enough information to understand why she acts the way she does.  And Dax is wonderful -- passionate, loving, and full of everything I love in a romance hero.  He is patient as he tries to coax Amber into trusting him and believing in their feelings for each other.  But, at the same time, he makes mistakes, resulting in a well-rounded, plausible character.<br />Shalvis does a fabulous job of developing the relationship between them.  Their emotions are believable, and their mistakes understandable.  In addition, the relationship between them develops at a reasonable pace.  They're given the time for defenses to break down -- for emotion to truly develop.<br />A wonderful book in the Temptation line!  Enjoy.	2001-12-13

Sarah wants to find the Fleetwood Flowers, gold and gem earrings owned (and buried) by her ancester Emelina.  And Gideon, an expert on treasure hunting with whom Sarah has been corresponding, is just the man to help her find them.  But Gideon isn't quite sure what to make of Sarah when she arrives on his doorstep and tells him just that!<br />Krentz used to write a lot of category romances, and if you read a number of them, you begin to notice similarities between all her heroes and heroines.  &quot;The Adventurer&quot; is not an exception.  It is, however, one of the best of Krentz's earlier work, with enough freshness to keep it above the pack.<br />Sarah is an immensely appealing character, impulsive, warm, and caring, and so forgiving of Gideon's defensiveness.  Gideon is a wonderfully protective hero (even if he clueless about his own feelings).  Their adventure -- to find the Fleetwood Flowers -- makes for an interesting plot surrounding their romance, and is intertwined enough in the development of that romance to make it intriguing.<br />This is, in my opinion, the best of this trilogy, and one of the best of Krentz's work from the 80's.<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-07

As with many romances, the problems melt away (especially hers) in a very romantic but not entirely realistic way.<br />That said, this is a very well-drawn genre romance.  While nothing about the plot or characters is especially original, Kent does a good job of developing their characters and their relationship.  The emotions of the characters seem very real, and the development of their romance is handled with sensitivity.  The depth of emotion portrayed is unusual for a genre romance.<br />It's also a good read, with appealing, likeable characters.  Enjoy!	2001-12-05

Best of Blaze	Every Harlequin line has the challenge of living up to the primary focus of the line (suspense in Intrigue, humor in Duets, etc.) while still managing a well-developed romance and believable, well-rounded characters.  The challenge of Blaze is to balance erotic sensuality with likeable characters and a plausible romance.  &quot;The Driven Snowe&quot; by Cathy Yardley is one of the best Blaze offerings I've read.<br />The romance between Angela and Josh is incredibly well-developed and credible, and it evolves at a reasonable, adult pace.  While I enjoy &quot;everything's all happy in Love Land even though the characters have only known one another a week&quot; romances, I really appreciated that Yardley gave Angela and Josh's relationship the time to mature.<br />Even more, I appreciated that the barriers to their happiness were credible ones, based not on misunderstanding or jumping to conclusions or any of the myriad of reasons that we see in romance novels, but on real emotions and defense mechanisms.<br />The only weakness I see in &quot;Snowe&quot; is that the love scenes, while erotic, don't really do anything to separate &quot;Snowe&quot; out from the crowd.  Unlike another reviewer, I didn't see Josh's fear of commitment and need to control the situation as requiring an explanation.  To me, they were simply normal human reactions to falling in love.<br />I read and enjoyed Yardley's last offering, the Duets book &quot;The Cinderella Solution,&quot; but &quot;Snowe&quot; is definitely a step up in Yardley's evolution as a writer.  I am, quite frankly, staggered that this is her second published novel.<br />I truly recommend this to anyone looking for a well-developed romance.  Enjoy!	2001-11-27

But she pushed aside any nagging doubts when she embarked on a shipboard fling with him.  Under the hot tropical sun, McCoy made her feel sexy... desirable... loved.  But was it the real thing?  Was Roy the real McCoy?<br />This is a decent, if somewhat shallow, title from a few years ago.  McCoy is a real charmer, and Laurel is sweet.  Their characters aren't well-developed, but their romance is sweet.<br />A sub-plot involving Laurel's friction with her father is left hanging a bit, which adds to the shallowness of the plot.  Still, this is a fun romance, with the charming characters and a nice exotic location.<br />Enjoy.	2001-11-15

Crew Harper was just doing his job -- washing windows outside the fourth story of a downtown office tower.  But a movement behind the glass caught his eye.  And what he saw was something no red-blooded male could resist -- Alexia Grant undressing!  Thank goodness he was transfixed by the caramel-haired beauty before him.  Because the moment she left, Crew saw a man enter Alexia's office and rifle through her desk.  The intruder was clearly up to no good.  Crew had to warn the lovely Alexia, but how could he be without telling her everything he saw?<br />This is an older Temptation title, which seems to differ a bit from the rigid Romance standard in the late 80's, early 90's.  It's fluff, but it's entertaining fluff, with a wonderful, funny, sensitive, supportive hero in Crew.  Alexia is a bit difficult to like, but she's not bad when she loosens up.<br />The romance between the two isn't all that well-developed, and seems a little surfac-ey, but Crew's good spirits and funny habit of talking to his dog Sam more than make up for that.  And the author intersperses funny comments throughout the book which really add a laugh!<br />Enjoy.	2001-11-15

Stephanie Laurens has based her Bar Cynster novels on the premise that even a man who doesn't particularly want to get married will be happily resigned to his fate once he meets his soul mate (even if she isn't resigned at all!).<br />That premise has served her better in some of the Cynster series than others.  It's a comforting premise, that we all have a soul mate out there, but adhering to that plot occasionally causes Laurens to churn out somewhat identical stories.  The best of the Cynster series retain enough of this &quot;soul mate&quot; premise to be comforting, but also manage to be original and fresh.<br />Thankfully, &quot;The Promise in a Kiss&quot; now joins &quot;A Secret Love&quot; and &quot;Devil's Bride&quot; on my list of &quot;Best of Cynster.&quot;<br />Sebastian is pure Cynster, and as Cynster fans all know, even the most boring of Cynster men are pretty ideal.  Helena is a wonderful match for him, strong-willed and feisty.  In addition, we are given good justification, both for Helena's strong-willed nature and for her resistance to Sebastian's protectiveness.  The misunderstandings between them have good basis, and the resolution of those misunderstandings is reasonable and understandable.<br />My only (small) quibble is that, because the &quot;villain&quot; is off-screen (so to say) most of the book, his villainous nature doesn't exactly loom over the book.<br />This is a welcome addition to the Cynster series -- Laurens at her best.

She's fantasized about the sexy handyman for months.  And she's recently heard from other women in her building that leaky pipes aren't all Greg fixes.  So she decides to go for it... and quickly learns just how good Greg is with his hands... All Greg Stone wants for Christmas is Suzanne Talbot.  Only, Suzanne's so classy, so sexy, so damn tempting.  Why would she want a guy like him?  But once Suzanne makes the first move, Greg can't resist her.  They come together in explosive, sensual encounters that are as mystical, as magical as the season itself.  And now all Greg has to do is convince Suzanne that the nights after Christmas can be even better...<br />Once again, Vicki Lewis Thompson manages to pull together well-developed characters, believable romantic development, and imaginative and original erotic scenes.  Suzanne is a wonderful character, shy yet sexy, and her need for order is given a good reason.  And Greg is one of those caring, generous men we all wish we could meet!  While Thompson gives Greg good justification for his bias against well-educated women, I appreciated that he didn't hold onto that bias beyond the point of reason (sometimes male romance heroes are downright unbelievable in their adherence to bias).<br />In addition, Thompson once again manages to give us steamy scenes that stand out from the crowd.  When you read a lot of romances, sometimes the erotic scenes can become a bit ho-hum, but Thompson always manages to give her lovemaking a fresh approach.<br />This is one of the best I've seen in the Temptation line -- a good balance of erotica, romance, and good characterization.  Keep 'em coming, Vicki, and I'll keep reading!	2001-11-12

I thoroughly disliked this Blaze offering, finding the characters unlikeable and the relationship development lacking in depth.<br />Erotic stories are often a tricky balance between sensual love scenes and emotional development, and while some of the contributions to the new Harlequin Blaze line manage to walk that line, others do not.  This, I'm afraid, is one I didn't enjoy.<br />I do not particularly enjoy &quot;tortured heroes.&quot;  In this case, the &quot;hero,&quot; Hunter, seems manipulative and unpleasant, and the &quot;heroine,&quot; Gillian, seems passive and pathetic.<br />While the story definitely has the sensual side down, I found it difficult to believe in the romantic development.  Hunter and Gillian didn't seem to me to really relate on any kind of believable level, and so I found it difficult to buy into their &quot;love.&quot;<br />Hey, if you're into the &quot;tortured and emotionally embittered man is slowly won over by a sweet virginal heroine&quot; type stories, then this one is definitely for you.  But if that's not your style, I'd advise staying away from this one.  Instead, check out &quot;Two Sexy!&quot; by Stephanie Bond, &quot;The Wild Side&quot; by Isabel Sharpe, or &quot;Notorious&quot; by Vicki Lewis Thompson -- all are titles in the new Blaze series.	2001-10-23

Now she takes on the sexy new &quot;Blaze&quot; line, with incredible results.<br />Plot Summary: Melissa Rogers, restless good girl, longs to indulge her sexual fantasies before she meets Mr. Right and settles down.  But instead she gets a walk on the really wild side, thanks to the uninhibited neighbor who skips town, leaving Melissa to take her place.  Riley Anderson, brilliant private investigator and every woman's fantasy, is assigned to seduce a female suspect.  But Melissa Rogers doesn't fit the profile of the woman he's after.  This woman makes him long for things he didn't even know he wanted.  Will it be pure eroticism, or forever-after commitment?<br />Too many times, authors writing erotic stories fall into the trap of writing incredibly sensational love scenes without really developing the relationship between the characters or the actual plot of the book.  Sharpe avoids the trap, though, giving &quot;The Wild Side&quot; a decent mystery sub-plot and giving both pairs of lovers in the book good romantic development.<br />In fact, Sharpe does a better job developing the relationship between the secondary couple.  Rose is a complex character, and Sharpe does a good job both of explaining Rose's emotional shields and in sketching their erosion at the hands of Slate.<br />Both Melissa and Riley are interesting characters, and while their relationship isn't given the depth of development that Rose and Slate's is, the conclusion is believable and gratifying.<br />&quot;The Wild Side&quot; is one of the better books in the new Harlequin Blaze line.  Enjoy!	2001-10-23

Not even in her wildest fantasies had she pictured responding so brazenly to a perfect stranger.  Even worse, she was engaged to his best friend!  But Zack was her desperado incarnate.<br />Things got totally out of control when Victoria's fiance insisted Zack take his place and accompany her on a holiday ... visiting a ghost town.  Her world spun out of control as fantasy and reality collided in the heat of the restless night.  She had the chance to live out her fantasies, but did she have the courage?<br />This is a fairly generic addition to the Temptation Blaze line.  As with most Blaze, the erotic scenes in this installment are steamy and imaginative.  And the hero, Zack ... whew!  White does a good job of describing what amounts to the world's steamiest, sexiest man.<br />Unfortunately, the rest of the storyline is fairly tepid.  Victoria's character isn't very well-sketched out, and the development of the &quot;romance&quot; is anemic and without real emotional basis.  In addition, Zack's about-face on his opinion of Victoria is bewilderingly sudden.<br />In addition, White throws in a ghostly plot.  The love scenes involving the ghosts are an interesting addition, but they aren't linked all that well into the plot.  Throw in Victoria's incredibly lame excuse for a fiance, and the whole thing lacks cohesion.<br />There are better sexy steamy romances out there.	2001-10-17

But it's a little out of the ordinary.  You see, the hero is involved with the Las Vegas mobster scene, and the heroine is a trash tabloid reporter.  But don't let you deter you from picking up this incredibly charming story!  The characters are wonderful, if out of the ordinary, and their romance is lot of fun.  (They'll definitely redeem themselves in your eyes.)<br />In &quot;I Got You, Babe,&quot; I liked the hero and heroine.  But Nick's infant niece definitely steals the story!  She's really hilarious in her disdain for her uncle Nick.  Tucker's style takes a little getting used to, too.  It's a little different from the romance norm.  But the story is interesting and charming.<br />All in all, a decent Duets offering.  Enjoy.	2001-10-01

When I pick up a Duets, I'm looking for funny situations and well-developed characters, and this particular volume definitely gives me the light-heartedness I'm looking for in a Duets volume!<br />In &quot;Blind Date Disasters,&quot; identical twin Cami Anderson hires a master carpenter to help redesign her home into a showpiece for her new career as an interior designer.  She expects someone older ... more experienced.  When Tanner McCall shows up ... well, he's definitely -experienced-!<br />Cami's blind date disasters are amusing, and the relationship between Cami and Tanner is developed well.  Cami, specifically, struggles with real issues, which brings additional depth to the story.  What really makes a Duet, I think, is a certain light-heartedness, but not so much that the humor interferes with the very real relationship in the story.<br />In &quot;Eat Your Heart Out,&quot; Cami's twin sister Dimi is a TV chef with her own TV show.  Except ratings are falling, and new producer Mitchell Knight brings himself into the show to inject a little pizzazz.  The only problem is that Dimi and Mitch can't seem to let the sexual heat go after filming is over!<br />&quot;Eat&quot; isn't quite as complex as &quot;Blind Date.&quot;  Dimi and Mitch are both very charming characters, and their relationship definitely has sexual tension.  Their repartee on the show is really funny!  But the issues in the way of a long-term relationship between them don't seem as well-developed as in the previous story, and so the relationship between them lacked some of the depth I was looking for.<br />Despite some weaknesses in &quot;Eat Your Heart Out,&quot; this is a Duets treat.  The humor and the heat are wonderful, and it's a whole lot of fun to read!  Enjoy.	2001-10-01

It may be one of Crusie's earlier works, but her inexperience isn't obvious.  Crusie manages to inject both funny and touching moments into a wonderfully developed romance.<br />Linc and Daisy are two very different people, and at first they aren't sure whether they really like one another.  But gradually, Linc begins to appreciate Daisy's warmth and compassion, and Daisy notices Linc's steadfastness and deep-rooted passion.  Gradually, they come to truly know and love one another in a very special, moving way.  This is -not- your typical genre romance.<br />Both main characters are well-developed, as are the secondary characters.  The earnestness of the characters, and Crusie's incredible gift for conveying emotional depth, make this truly a wonderful romance.<br />\\"The Cinderella Deal\\" is a prize, not just for Crusie fans, but also for those who love a good romance.  It's also a hoot!  I truly hope that the publishers realize what a possible audience they have for earlier Crusie titles ... and gives us some reprints.  Personally, I am thankful for interlibrary loan!	2001-10-01

I'm a sucker for Duets, and for Duets set in Nowhere Texas specifically.  Nowhere, Texas, you see, is the setting for both this volume and &quot;Designer Genes/Two for One!&quot; by the same authors.<br />This volume gives me everything I'm looking for in a Duets volume.  The relationships are developed well, but the impediments to &quot;true love&quot; don't involve really painful issues that would detract from the general &quot;romantic comedy&quot; flavor.  Both the main characters and the secondary characters are appealing and just quirky enough to provide a number of hilarious situations.<br />This particular volume doesn't provide a lot of real emotional depth to off-set all the silliness.  But that kind of depth is a rare thing indeed in a romantic comedy, and probably not what you're looking for in a Duets volume anyway.  This is a very good, funny read, and you'll fall in love with all the characters of Nowhere.  I did!	2001-10-01

But now she needs a pretend husband in order to keep her new position at the magazine where she works, and her ex-husband seems to be the best one for the job.  If only she could keep from falling in love with him again...<br />This is a well-developed story with more emotional depth than the typical series romance.  The characters have a past, and of course that past involves pain and regrets.  But they've both changed, and the way Hoffmann builds up their relationship again is both sensitive and appealing.<br />The characters are both well-rounded characters, struggling to deal with the mistakes they made in their past relationship.  They're appealing, yet flawed, and they seem very real to the reader.<br />My only complaint is that the story insists they'd loved each other in the past, but there doesn't seem to have been that much of an emotional bond between them during their marriage.  Since the new relationship is based on that love, I wasn't sure how much I bought into it.<br />However, that's a nit-pick.  This is a sensitive portrait of two people learning to love each other again, and not only that, it's an interesting, enjoyable read with the erotic scenes typical of a Temptation.<br />Enjoy!	2001-09-26

One day, Kayla and Tuesday pass by a Curiosities store, where they're sold a wonderfully-illustrated book about knights.  Kayla falls asleep reading the book ... and awakens to the two knights from the story, fighting in full armor at the foot of her bed!  All of a sudden, Kayla's trying to hide the knights from her nosy, grumpy neighbor and battle her growing attraction to Septimus... now known as Tim.<br />Julie Kistler has a way with humor, injecting hilarious situations and charming characters into (relatively) believable romances.  In this particular installment, Tim is a wonderful hero, full of all the good qualities that make up a knight ... even if he is initially cast as the &quot;villain.&quot;  Tuesday, Kayla's daughter, is incredibly charming, and Kayla is a sympathetic heroine.<br />This is an easy, amusing read full of funny situations and appealing characters.

This is a Harlequin Love &amp; Laughter title, so you expect a lot of humor and charming characters, and this book definitely lives up to the series.<br />Plot Summary: When freelance writer Mabel Ivey is offered a full-time job at &quot;Real Men&quot; magazine -- the magazine dedicated to helping women find real-life heroes -- she jumps at the chance. She's not sure whether to be complimented or insulted, however, that the first story is to be a makeover -- her makeover! Then Mabel learns that the photographer chronicling her every new hairstyle and sexy new dress is none other than gorgeous Trace Cameron. Turning him on is the ultimate challenge, but once Trace is interested, she realizes she has a new problem on her hands. Is Trace after the new and improved Mabel? Or the real woman beneath the fancy clothes?<br />&quot;50 Ways&quot; is a hilarious journey through one woman's makeover from &quot;Plain Jane&quot; to &quot;Biker Chick&quot; to &quot;Starlet.&quot; Her companion on the journey is handsome and sophisticated Trace, who finds the real Mabel charming just as she is.<br />This book is full of funny situations, and the characters are appealing and adorable. Because the book is told almost wholly from Mabel's perspective, we don't get as much into understanding Trace as I would have liked. But everything else about this book is so charming that it's easy to disregard that weakness.<br />In addition, I think there's a positive message here: that no matter what you do to your outside, the most important thing is liking who -you- are.<br />A fun, enjoyable read!	2001-09-21

There was nothing for a hero to do except find out why.<br />Alec's plan involved rules:<br />1.  They needed to escape to a secluded hideout.<br />2.  Alec needed to learn everything about Christine.<br />3.  Heated, passionate lovemaking was highly recommended.<br />4.  Under no circumstances was Christine to fall in love with him.<br />Too late, Alec realized he'd fallen in love.  Once he finished rescuing Christine, would she have any more use for a hero?<br />&quot;Rescuing Christine&quot; is an entertaining, very humorous tale of two opposites attracting.  Alec is charming but lazy, while Christine is highly motivated but doesn't know how to have fun.  Their close proximity develops a relationship between them, and the final balance in their relationship is sweet and believable.<br />In addition, I appreciated that, while Alec hadn't really had any serious relationships, he also didn't seem to have a commitment phobia.  I grow tired of men with commitment phobias in romances, and appreciated that, once Alec had gotten to know Christine, he realized that they were really good together.<br />This book is a well-written, smoothly-developed book with appealing characters and a great deal of wit.

Unfortunately, I didn't find the characters or their romantic relationship all that believable. They seem to have an irresistible sexual draw, but I found nothing solid in their current relationship. Harper and Macon were lovers as teens, but it's been 15 years, and McBride doesn't do a particularly good job of developing any kind of current relationship between them. It appears they're either fighting and distrusting one another, or they're making love. Macon is understandably upset to find out that he had a son he never knew about, but the situation is never adequately discussed and dealt with by Harper and Macon. That said, the writing is decent, and I at least finished it (which is saying something because I'm impatient with bad writing). The love scenes are steamy, and the secondary characters appealing. Still, it really seems like there are a lot better romance novels out there.	2001-08-24

When the writer of a Real Men column runs away with a stripper, Rosie is given the assignment. There's only one catch -- she has to write like a guy. No problem ... until she starts receiving letters from sexy lawyer Ben Taylor. He thinks he really needs a man-to-man talk, but Rosie knows what he really needs is a woman like her...<br />&quot;Forget Me? Not&quot; -- Straitlaced, by-the-book Amanda Baldwin is at loose ends. Her longtime fiance has just dumped her! What's Amanda to do? Easy ... let a charismatic, hunky beach guy -- namely Zach Castelli -- show her the wild side of life. Zach is irrepressible, unpredictable, and uncommitted -- he thinks marriage is a state of unhappily ever after. He just wants to help Amanda forget about her fiance, but after a few close encounters, will he want the job? And will Amanda approve the change?<br />This particular Duets installment is somewhat uneven, and not as good as other Duets I've read. &quot;Mail&quot; has charming characters and an appealing romance, but it seemed like Collins was trying to bring together too many elements. There's Rosie's job, Rosie's brothers, Ben's ex's, plus them, their romance, the parking situation ... too many pieces make the puzzle not quite fit. Unfortunately, Ben and Rosie's romance gets slighted. And I was upset about that, because Ben and Rosie are both wonderful, funny characters with a lot of life and verve, and I wanted to be able to believe in happily ever after for them. That said, the story is sweet, and I flew through it, laughing out loud as I went.<br />&quot;Forget&quot; is a good read, with very charming characters (especially Zach). I was distressed by Zach's insensitivity to the effects of his inability to commit, and I found his continued pursuit of Amanda a little disturbing. That said, this was a fun, interesting story with a lot going for it.<br />All in all, this was a fun book to read, but there are better Duets installments out there.in all, this was a fun book to read, but there are better Duets installments out there.	2001-08-24

The three heroes are linked by an elevator accident and the subsequent purchase of a ranch.  The three stories plot the development of romantic relationships for these three men, as well as the eventual solution of a mystery that runs throughout all three.<br />Thompson's most recent work is distinguished by humor, clear writing, and imaginative erotic scenes (especially in her Temptation/Blaze stuff).  Since the stories in &quot;Urban Cowboys&quot; date back a few years, they don't have the same zing that I've enjoyed in her recent books.<br />All of the characters are engaging, and the stories are obviously heavily linked and work well in an anthology such as this.  I can see the roots of Thompson's later work in some of the more imaginative scenes.<br />But for the most part, these stories read like hundreds of other romances.  Fans of Thompson looking for the complete collection will probably grab it and enjoy it.  And there's nothing here -not- to like.  I simply didn't enjoy this particular collection as much as Thompson's newer stuff.<br />Enjoy!	2001-08-21

Arielle was Mary Jane's nanny, basically raising her when Mary Jane's father distanced himself after the death of his wife, so Mary Jane feels she owes Arielle a lot.  One horrible day, Morgan arrives with the news that Arielle is now dead, and as they deal with their grief over her death, and struggle with who Arielle was to both of them, they also begin to fall in love.<br />&quot;Her Best Friend's Baby&quot; is part of the Maitland Maternity series by Harlequin.  I can't speak on how it fits into the remainder of the series, because I haven't read them.<br />This is a really well-written, well-developed offering by Thompson.  The characters are believable and become very real, and the development of the romantic relationship between the two characters is sensitively handled.<br />In a situation such as this, it would be easy for the development of the romance to feel like a violation of Arielle's memory.  But Thompson does a good job of developing both the character's feelings towards one another and their eventual acceptance of their grief.  As both of them come to terms with the reality of their relationships with Arielle, they also come to understand how much they can give to one another.<br />Because this book comes out in a more mainstream line, Thompson doesn't include any of the imaginative erotic scenes that are part of her Blaze/Temptation books.  However, she still handles the love scenes with a deft and sensitive touch, making them both erotic and believable.<br />An incredibly sensitive and well-developed offering from Thompson.	2001-08-21

Gwen's had it with lighthearted playboy men and wants nothing to do with Travis!<br />This is a wonderfully funny, engaging read with well-crafted characters and a lot of steamy eroticism.  Truly a joy to read.  I liked how Travis become something other than what we originally expect, and how we come to know Gwen and her deep insecurities.  (And, despite how un-PC this is, I loved the cover!  Yum.)<br />However, I must quibble with two things.  First, I hate it when the female characters really don't want anything to do with the guy, yet their bodies &quot;betray them&quot; and they're overcome with lust.  I know this was a popular theme 20-30 years ago, but aren't we past that now?  Second, the theme holding this series together, baby Elizabeth, is a little tough to swallow.<br />However, if you can get past these two points, this is a very well-written, funny, engaging read by Thompson.

Knowledge of the previous two books helps but is not required.<br />In this particular installment, Boone is driving back home to meet up with his friends and see the baby he thinks is his when he runs into a blizzard.  While waiting for the blizzard to pass, he comes to the aid of a woman and a child who appear to be running from something that terrifies them.  He goes to their aid, bringing them back with him to the ranch.  And he falls in love, despite his avowal to straighten out the situation with baby Elizabeth first.<br />The characters in this particular installment of &quot;Three Cowboys&quot; are wonderful, if out of the ordinary for this genre.  Boone is especially engaging -- a caring, comforting puppydog of a man with a heart as big as the rest of him.  Thompson adds a lot of humor and some steamy sensuality to make this particular installment a good, entertaining, heart-warming read.<br />My only complaint with this book, as with the rest of the series, is that the baby Elizabeth hook, while sweet, is simply not all that believable.  But if you can put any disbelief aside and transcend that, this is a wonderful, engaging book with charming characters.	2001-08-20

Something was suddenly different about her.  He'd never noticed that her legs were so long... or her lips quite so full.  Why, it was almost as if sultry but sensible Miss Thornbury was trying to seduce him!  Well, two could play at this game.  After all, he was a scholar -- it was time he figured out what was up with her.  Even if it took all day -- and all night.  The things a man will do in the name of research...&quot;<br />Rory Monahan is not a typical romance hero.  The fact that Rory is a befuddled scholar concentrating more on medieval history than anything else may detract from his appeal for the mass romance audience.  However, in my opinion that detracts little from his appeal in this book.<br />Rory is quite charming, and very sweet.  And Miriam is sweet in her efforts to get Rory to notice her.  Rory and Miriam may be atypical romance characters, but they seem like real people.<br />In addition, &quot;Temptation&quot; is full of the trademark Bevarly humor and stream-of-consciousness writing.  While this type of writing does not appeal to everyone, for a Bevarly fan, &quot;Temptation&quot; is a stand-out.  There are quite a few of those laugh-out-loud moments, and Rory's confusion as he attempts to make sense of the situation is hilarious.<br />That said, I have my typical complaint about Bevarly novels, and that is -- we get so much of the stream-of-consciousness writing that the development of the actual feelings is neglected.  We enjoy and root for Miriam and Rory, but I'm not sure that their romance is ever completely believable.<br />However, this -is- a genre romance, and for those who can appreciate Bevarly's writing style, &quot;Temptation&quot; is wonderful and hilarious and a lot of fun to read.	2001-08-17

Her snappy writing style, appealing characters, and great humor always make for enjoyable, interesting reads.<br />Tess and Will are both engaging characters, and their romance, growing as it does out of a long-standing friendship, is very appealing.  The story itself is based on a bad misunderstanding, though, and while the misunderstanding itself was essential to the plot, it is, like so many romance novel misunderstandings, difficult to buy into.  I cannot imagine that the people who love and trust Tess doubt the truth when she tells it to them.<br />While the characters -are- charming, and their love story is believable, this particular story lacks some of the &quot;zing&quot; that I have come to associate with Bevarly novels.  The characters were almost too sweet and one-dimensional.<br />Still, Bevarly's mediocre is still better than a lot of authors' bests, and it's a fine, engaging read.  Enjoy!	2001-08-16

Seth seems arrogant and full of himself, while Pru seems to lack self-confidence.  Their dialogue is snappy and witty, and while that's appealing, the initial lack of appeal hinders the story.<br />Fortunately, Bevarly ultimately does a good job of developing the characters.  While Seth continues to seem arrogant, we also discover a deep sense of insecurity about him, while we're also learning the reasons for Pru's lack of faith in herself.<br />Ultimately, this is a decent read, and a good romance.  Bevarly's writing style is very appealing, and can make up for other weaknesses, and the ultimate development of the characters and romance turn out well.	2001-08-15

A confirmed wild child, she'd shocked the town by posing for a centerfold at the age of nineteen.  But what she'd really wanted was to get a reaction from seriously sexy Noah Garfield.  Only, back then, he hadn't quite known what to do with her... Now, years later, Noah's still in over his head with Keely.  But when he catches her walking into a Vegas strip joint, he knows that he has to save her from herself.  Only, Keely doesn't want to be saved.  Instead, Noah's supersexy childhood nemesis seems determined to show him exactly what he's been missing...&quot;<br />This is the follow-up story to Thompson's contribution to the anthology &quot;Midnight Fantasies,&quot; which featured a wonderful story involving B.J. and Jonas, two childhood friends working on a ranch together.  &quot;Notorious&quot; picks up the storyline with their siblings, Keely and Noah.<br />Thompson is one of the better authors writing in the steamy Harlequin genre at the moment.  Her erotic scenes are well-written and imaginative.  In addition to her incredible grasp of the erotic, Thompson gives us fully-developed characters and believable romantic tension.<br />&quot;Notorious&quot; is a wonderful example of Thompson's grasp of the genre.  Keely and Noah are interesting and appealing characters, and their attraction is hot hot hot!  Thompson does a good job of building up sexual and emotional tension between the characters.<br />As usual, I have the familiar complaint that perhaps the romantic impediments were disposed of too quickly, but this is still still a steamy, stand-out read.<br />Enjoy!	2001-08-14

Delaney's adventures are sure to bring a smile to your face, and Jack is a great, supportive hero.<br />This isn't a particularly deep or sophisticated book, but it's a fun summer read.

This, however is not one of the ones I like.<br />Howard has always written about very Alpha Male heroes.  In some of her earlier work, including this one, she takes that portrayal to an extreme.  The &quot;hero&quot; in this work seems lacking in emotion and even leaning towards the emotionally abusive.<br />The &quot;heroine,&quot; on the other hand, is written as an emotional wimp.  It's written that she's &quot;strong,&quot; but she lets the &quot;hero&quot; walk all over her, making herself totally emotionally available to a man who, quite frankly, seems unworthy of it.<br />I love most of Howard's work, but this is not a book I'm going to keep in my personal collection.	2001-07-27

As usual with anthologies, some stories were better than others, but all were good reading.<br />&quot;Arts Magica&quot; by Kay Hooper was one of the stand-out stories in this bunch.  The hero and heroine were well-developed for a novella, and the premise was both interesting and different from the norm.<br />I don't normally enjoy overly sweet romantic stories, but I'll make an exception for &quot;Gabriel's Angel.&quot;  The characters and romance were very, well, sweet, and I was definitely rooting for them by the end.<br />&quot;Stuck with You&quot; is a decent story.  The novella form forces the characters to undo long-time biases in a short amount of time -- a short enough time that the transition in their relationship felt abrupt.  But, the characters were appealing, and I especially enjoyed the ending.<br />&quot;Close Quarters&quot; was probably the weakest of the bunch, although it's still a good read.  The secondary characters were especially appealing with their mischief.  But, again, the relationship transition felt awkward.<br />&quot;Trouble at Midnight&quot; is well-written, with an interesting premise.  I liked the characters a lot, and enjoyed the story.  But I felt a little cheated, too;  this story could have used a little more development to be truly outstanding.<br />Despite all these criticisms, all the stories in this anthology were well-written and interesting.  This is a very good read from some talented authors.  (And, even better, since it's now 2001, we can look at the dire Y2K predictions and snicker.  Hehe.)	2001-07-27

Books	2	9	9	N	N	A weaker anthology	I enjoyed much of &quot;Rough Around the Edges,&quot; so it was with some pleasure that I bought this seemingly-similar anthology of stories. Unfortunately, none of the stories in this volume really stands out as particularly erotic or enjoyable.<br />In theory, Susan Johnson's style should work well in the novella form. Her mix of history and seemingly-endless imaginative sex by well-endowed characters seems well-fitted for the short form, especially considering her particular style doesn't often seem to call for real emotional development between the characters. In fact, her story in &quot;Rough Around the Edges&quot; was one of the stronger in the volume. But her contribution in this volume seemed lacking. There seemed even less emotional development than is even typical for Johnson, and the history didn't seem all that interesting. A disappointment.<br />Logan's contribution seems the strongest, with decent character and romantic development mixed in with a nice little &quot;suspense&quot; type plot. The erotic scenes were well-done.<br />I really liked the hero of Adrianne Lee's story, and although I found the heroine's &quot;quest&quot; a little unrealistic, I enjoyed the story.<br />Winston's contribution is also very strong. It's the story with the most romantic development between the characters.<br />All in all, there are better anthologies out there.	2001-07-27

My biggest complaint with the book, as a whole, is the combination of historical and modern stories.  While I, personally, enjoy both types, I know a lot of romance readers have definite preferences one way or the other.  Also, it's more difficult to create a distinctive yet satisfying and smooth collection of stories set in different periods.<br />I bought this collection for Howard's entry, and the story itself contains many of the elements I enjoy in Howard's work.  However, the story was almost too short, and a bit unsatisfying, and I really wanted to know more about the characters and their romance.<br />Dawson's &quot;Castaway&quot; is a decent entry, with appealing characters and a believable romance.  There were some funny moments.  My major complaint is that it seemed more a contemporary romance than an historical one.<br />Hunter's &quot;Ruined&quot; was my favorite of the bunch.  I loved the hero and heroine, and enjoyed Hunter's writing style.  I can't wait to check out more of her work!<br />Jarrett's &quot;Buried Treasure&quot; was, I think, the weakest of the bunch.  I couldn't get into the characters and didn't really enjoy the romantic plot.  However, I must disclaim that the American colonial period isn't a period I typically enjoy reading about.<br />Stewart's &quot;Swept Away&quot; was another solid addition, with good characters and a decent romance.  I appreciated the emotional depth provided by Jeremy's facing of his past, and the sunburn provided a few chuckles.<br />All in all, this is a solid addition to the compilation genre.	2001-07-25

The story has to develop the characters and romance enough that they're believable in a much shorter length of time.<br />While a reader could accuse &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; of being &quot;too light&quot; and perhaps a bit unbelievable, this is a charming and entertaining collection by authors that all handle the novella genre well.<br />Kurland's &quot;Icing&quot; is probably the weakest story in the bunch, despite the fact that Kurland is the headlining author here.  The characters are very appealing, and I really enjoyed the role reversal, but I didn't find their romance particularly believable.<br />I didn't find the romance in Bevarly's &quot;Summer&quot; believable, either, but as usual Bevarly's humorous, distinctive stream-of-consciousness writing style and incredibly charming characters make up for the lack of a deep romantic development.<br />Carmichael's &quot;Pride&quot; was the best of the bunch.  The characters were believable, as was their romance, and the dogs definitely rounded out the whole thing.  Carmichael has a real gift for adding in appealing secondary characters, be they ghosts (&quot;A Ghost for Maggie&quot;) or dogs (&quot;Finding Mr. Right&quot;).<br />Minger's &quot;Princess&quot; is also good, with some pathos and humor thrown into the mix, along with believable characters and a nice adventure plot.<br />&quot;Opposites Attract&quot; is not deep lasting literature, but it -is- fun and entertaining, and, in the end, I think that's what we ask of romantic novella anthologies.	2001-07-25

While none of the stories are outstanding or especially memorable, all are good enjoyable reads.<br />&quot;Jessie's Girl&quot; by Madeline Baker is a sweet story, portraying a pair of lovers who are charming but somewhat shallow.  Kathy, especially, seems almost too good and naive to be real.  The premise, involving Jessie as a vampiric Elvis, is a bit unusual, but also feels a bit &quot;off.&quot;  Of the four, this struck me as the weakest contribution.<br />I really enjoy Nina Bangs' writing, and &quot;Hunka&quot; is no exception.  The characters are appealing and well-developed, and the story brims with good humor and charm.<br />I really liked the premise of Ann Lawrence's &quot;Heaven-Sent.&quot;  The characters are charming, and the romance and mystery are very sound.  The &quot;heavenly&quot; slant also made this story a little out of the ordinary.<br />Nance's &quot;Best-Laid Plans&quot; was another nice little gem.  While it's not spectacular in any way, decent writing and well-developed characters make this a solid contribution.<br />All in all, this is a great summer read, especially for the Elvis fan!	2001-07-20

Her honesty, forthrightness, sense of humor, and family reliance all make her an unusually strong and well-developed character.  The reluctant hero, Jack, has the bone-deep strength combined with incredibly dangerous effectiveness that always make Linda Howard's heroes so incredibly appealing.<br />The suspense/mystery in &quot;Open Season&quot; is well-done, as usual with Howard.  It's interesting enough to provide tension but not so overwhelming as to detract from the characterization and relationship development.<br />As in Howard's previous effort, &quot;Mr. Perfect,&quot; we get quite a few laugh-out loud moments, which add tremendously to the appeal.<br />My only criticism is that the relationship between Jack and Daisy somehow lacks the intensity normally found in Howard's books. The relationship lacks both the &quot;immediate sensing of mate&quot; basis typical to Howard books and the &quot;gradual deepening of romance&quot; generally found in romance novels.<br />&quot;Open Season&quot; is a tremendous demonstration of all that has made Howard a leader in the field of romantic suspense.  The wonderful humor, great suspense, and intense sexuality combine to make this another masterful effort by Howard.  It was a lot of fun to read!	2001-07-18

All four manage the novella form well, with believable and appealing characters and good writing.<br />Janelle Taylor is the editor and featured writer in this compilation with her story &quot;Straight from the Heart.&quot;  As is often the case with these compilations, her story ends up the weakest.  Kim is stranded in a mountain cabin with Stephen, to whom she is attracted.  Unfortunately, Stephen's law firm represented her lying husband in her divorce and she still holds onto that resentment.  Kim is a decent character, although she seems overly bitter towards Stephen.  The hero Stephen is OK, but  the story doesn't give much of a sense of him, and their &quot;romance&quot; isn't well-developed within the confines of the novella form.  Still, it's a sweet little love story.<br />&quot;Summer Fantasy&quot; by Jill Marie Landis is one of the better stories in this group.  The character of Kylee is especially strong, and the romance between the two is well-developed and believable.  A good story with an ending I bought into.<br />Stella Cameron is a talented author, and the plot of &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; is an interesting one, as it involves aliens seeking humans as sex therapists.  As always, Cameron handles her erotic scenes very well, and her writing is very distinctive.  This story also works well in the novella format.  I'm not sure I always bought into this story, but Cameron's work is always interesting if nothing else.<br />Anne Stuart's &quot;Sultry&quot; is a decent story.  The characters were appealing and the romance believable.  The story itself is nothing distinctive or special, but it's a decent addition to this compilation.<br />All in all, this is an enjoyable compilation, with good writing and charming characters.  While some stories are weaker than others, Landis's strong contribution and Cameron's distinctive writing style give it an edge over other similar compilations.similar compilations.	2001-07-18

Em is touted as a &quot;Victorian lady,&quot; but we see little of it in her reactions to Jeff and life around Jeff, and  the fears resulting from her long-ago problems with her mother aren't resolved at all.<br />I've been enjoying the saga of the Winston brothers, and &quot;Tangled Images&quot; is no exception.  I really enjoyed reading about Mack, maybe even more than the &quot;C&quot; brother stories.  Foster manages to deliver well-developed characters and a decently-resolved plot in a short amount of time.  This installment isn't as funny as previous installments, but it's still very well-done.<br />My major criticism of &quot;Sinderella&quot; and &quot;Leather and Lace&quot; is that the stories had premises that were too similar.  If I had compiled this anthology, I would have separated these stories to ensure they didn't blur together.<br />That said, I really enjoyed &quot;Sinderella,&quot; probably the most of any story in this anthology.  I always appreciate stories where good friends become lovers, and this story was a well-written example of that sub-genre.  The characters were appealing, and their relationship well-developed.  I understood and appreciated Frankie's reasons for approaching Connor &quot;in costume,&quot; and found her predicament with the mask very amusing.<br />&quot;Leather and Lace&quot; is again one of the weaker installments in this collection.  I really didn't particularly like Richard, the &quot;hero,&quot; and found his about-face, and sudden &quot;commitment,&quot; a bit unbelievable.  I liked Martha Jane, and found her introduction to Richard as &quot;Valentine&quot; to be amusing, but found the romance between them difficult to buy into.<br />However, despite these weaknesses, this is a very good anthology by authors more talented then the pack.  The writing flows well, and the characters are, in general, very appealing.  The erotic scenes are very erotic indeed, with great writing and no unbelievable dialogue.  If you're a fan of any of these authors, or just a fan of novella compilations in general, this book will be a good read for you.ot;Valentine&quot; to be amusing, but found the romance between them difficult to buy into.<br />However, despite these weaknesses, this is a very good anthology by authors more talented then the pack.

But I appreciated the good writing and appealing characters, and the romance was very sweet (especially with the happily ever after ending).<br />I thought &quot;Love Sessions&quot; the best of the bunch.  Stories where the hero and heroine know one another but are forced to reevaluate themselves and their relationship always appeal to me a lot, and Devine handles the fears of the heroine very well.  Both of the characters were well-developed and very charming, and Hunter is a man any woman would want!  Devine's writing style was a little out of the ordinary, but still very easy to follow, and if anything the oddity only enhanced the story.<br />&quot;Promise Me Pleasure&quot; was probably the weakest story, although I began to like it more as it went on.  This is a personal preference, but &quot;immediate hot attraction between two incredibly attractive people&quot; stories don't appeal to me as much, especially when they involve international playboys.  And the relationship seemed to be initially based too much on sex.  That said, Mason does a good job of developing that relationship, and the fantasy of being &quot;romanced&quot; by the world's sexiest man will be enough to pull in many readers.  The writing was good, and the characters attractive.<br />All in all, this is a good summer read.  Enjoy!	2001-07-16

But friend and neighbor Gavin's been waiting for her, and he's not taking &quot;No!&quot; for an answer. This is a really sweet story, with the good writing we've come to expect from Lori Foster. It doesn't have the heavy sensuality of some of her other stories, but the characters are appealing. Sara's big heart and her continual adoption of unwanted pets will win the heart of any animal-lover, and Gavin's patient kindness certainly deserves the reward he gets at the end. My only quibble is that, after such a wonderful build-up, the ending seemed both forced and rushed.<br />&quot;The Cinderella Solution&quot; by Cathy Yardley doesn't feature an especially novel concept -- a tomboy throws out her sweats for tight-fitting dresses and her ponytail for a sleek new hairdo, and as a result of her new-found confidence catches the eye of all kinds of men, including her befuddled best friend! But Yardley writes well, and she makes her characters extremely appealing and funny. The transition from friends to lovers can be a difficult one, and Yardley writes well about the fears and feelings that come with such a transition. The secondary characters also add to the tale.<br />It's always interesting to buy a compilation or &quot;duet&quot; and see how an author I haven't read before matches up against the established author I bought the book to read. In this case, I bought the book to read Foster's contribution (and wasn't disappointed!), but ended up enjoying Yardley's quick wit and charming characters as much, if not more!<br />A funny and appealing read - great for summer beaches and airplane trips!	2001-07-16

But it wasn't nice, safe Mr. Perfect who kissed her senseless. Horrors! It as Bryan Morgan - wild man, stunt pilot, and all-around daredevil. And, heaven help her, she'd really liked that kiss. Which just proved what she'd known all along - she was Christmas cursed!<br />&quot;Hug Me, Holly!&quot; - Sheriff Riley McMann couldn't believe his ears when Holly Stone announced that she'd be taking over the only caf&eacute; in Little Paradise. She looked as if she hadn't worked a day in her life, and besides, he had to eat there! But he was soon working up quite an appetite for &quot;Calamity Holly&quot; when he discovered there was more to her than designer clothes and an attitude. Maybe his Christmas wishes were going to come true after all....<br />&quot;Katie&quot; is a very appealing story, with charming characters, an amusing story, and a romance that's developed well.  The character Katie has very real fears that impede her ability to envision Bryan as a romantic possibility, and Shalvis writes well about how Bryan helps Katie overcome those fears.  Bryan is a great character, and I appreciated that Bryan had to come to certain realizations before Katie could really trust him.  All in all, a charming story that's handled well.<br />&quot;Holly&quot; is also an appealing story, with captivating characters, and it features a welcoming town full of other wonderful characters.  Holly herself is a complex character, and I liked it that Shalvis gave her a complicated personality under her brains and beauty.  Riley is also very charming, and I appreciated his intelligence and willingness to try and understand Holly in all of her complexity.  That said, this story definitely pales in comparison to &quot;Katie.&quot;  Holly is a complicated character, but the story takes too long to develop that complexity.  As a result, the development of the character of Riley, and the romance between them, is handled in a more shallow manner than I would have liked.  Despite that, &quot;Holly&quot; is still a good, funny read - ahead of most of the romance pack.<br />This is a good summer read, full of good characters and funny details.

While it can be easy for an author to deal in a shallow way with the impact a divorce can have on self-esteem, Ortolon does a really good job of developing Kate and having her deal with her reactions and fears in a realistic and legitimate way.<br />The hero, Michael, is everything you want in a contemporary romance hero.  He is caring, patient, and deals well with Kate's charming-but-sometimes-difficult son, Dylan.  And he's so very appealing and sweet.<br />Ortolon puts a lot of effort into displaying Kate's fears and in showing Michael's attempts to overcome those fears.  Unfortunately, I almost felt as if the issues melted away in a really opportune sort of way.  One common weakness in romance novels is that the issues between a couple suddenly disappear, and voila!  Everything's golden.  The same issue applies to a secondary romance between two of Kate's friends.<br />That said, this is a wonderful, amusing but deep read for any romance reader.  In the end, we read romances because we want to celebrate all the joy that can come with a successful romance, and this book gives us all of that.	2001-07-13

I have grown uncomfortable with the males' constant attempts to dominate their lifemates in previous installments of this series.  And I appreciated learning that the female Carpathians do eventually develop their own powers.<br />The relationship between the two &quot;main&quot; characters, Dara and Julian, is strong and well-developed, and their clashes provide humor and playfulness not always evident in this relatively dark, tortured series.  And the secondary characters are all well-drawn and strong.<br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, Feehan did so good a job of developing the secondary characters that they sometimes overwhelm the &quot;featured couple.&quot;  Especially strong is Darius, whose brooding protectiveness and fierce hunting and healing instincts made him, in the end, a more interesting character than Julian.  And, personally, I thought Julian deserved better.<br />One of the weaknesses of this series is that Feehan introduces villains, but those villains never seem all that dangerous compared to the fierce Carpathian males.  In this particular installment, the &quot;villain&quot; is especially weak, and not particularly interesting.  I could have lived without that kind of struggle at all.<br />As usual, this particular installment features good writing and character development, with good erotic scenes.

There always exists a threat that the books will become monotonous -- too much like one another.<br />&quot;Dark Gold&quot; itself stands pretty well on its own.  There's good chemistry between the hero and heroine, and the writing flows smoothly.<br />Unfortunately, this particular installment is a pale imitation of the quality that came before.  The beginning of the book is compelling, but after Alexandria and Aidan meet up, it's the same old struggle for Alexandria to deal with the change from human to Carpathian that Shea and Raven went through in much more compelling and realistic ways in &quot;Dark Prince&quot; and &quot;Dark Desire.&quot;<br />In addition, the struggle for dominance/protection between Aidan and Alexandria is the same old struggle that came in the &quot;Dark&quot; books that precede this one.  It becomes a bit monotonous after awhile.<br />On the other hand, we see more of long-time human/Carpathian relationships in this one in the form of faithful retainers that serve Aidan and his home.  I appreciated that glimpse of a relationship that seems to transcend the &quot;human as food and lesser being&quot; concept that can become common in vampire-related literature.<br />All in all, this is a decent read.  Feehan writes well, and her characters and relationships are interesting.  Unfortunately, this is the weakest installment in the &quot;Dark&quot; series, so it somewhat pales in comparison to the others.	2001-07-12

The writing flows smoothly, and the relationship between the characters is well-developed.<br />Shea and Jacques are different from characters introduced in other installments of this series.  I appreciated Shea's struggle with her independence and her rebellion against Carpathian ways.  I also appreciated that Jacques relied on her in ways that other Carpathian males in this series did not rely on their lifemates.  I appreciated Shea's sharp mind, and I thought Jacques' struggle against his &quot;beast&quot; was well-drawn and interesting.<br />In contrast to most of the other &quot;Dark&quot; books, the villains in this piece are threatening and well-drawn.  They provide what amounts to a much more real threat to the Carpathians, and thus give the plot more tension and more of a drive towards a conclusion.  Unfortunately, Feehan doesn't provide enough background on the major villain -- I'd recommend that you read &quot;Dark Prince&quot; before tackling this one, since it provides that background.  Also, it seemed like, although the tension was built up well between the main villain and the protagonists, the villain didn't provide much of a threat at the very end, which disappointed me.<br />All in all, I found this one of the best of the Dark installments.	2001-07-12

All the writing was good, with appealing characters and, of course, the appeal of the Scottish personality and landscape.<br />&quot;Lassie Go Home&quot; by Connie Brockway is charming, with very charismatic characters and decent romantic development.  There are some laugh-out-loud moments as well!<br />&quot;Sinfully Scottish&quot; by Patti Berg is good, as well.  The erotic undertones are strong, with well-developed, charming characters.  The romantic development wasn't as strong, though - a common characteristic of a novella.  It was still better than most novellas, just due to atmosphere and good writing.<br />&quot;The Maddening Highlander&quot; by Debra Dier is another decent story.  The writing is good, and the mystery a nice touch, but the characters seemed a little flat and stereotyped.<br />&quot;Castle in the Skye&quot; by Kathleen Givens is a nice story, with an especially good heroine and some strong supporting characters.  The hero seems a bit too good to be true, but the relationship is well-developed.<br />All in all, this is an above-average compilation of stories with good Scottish atmosphere.  While none of the stories stand out as especially good, it's consistent throughout, and an easy, enjoyable read.	2001-07-11

In a novel, an author has time to develop characters and plot -- to make the characters and the developing relationship between them believable.

All he knows is that this sexy woman wants him. And for Jonas, that's enough - for now . . .&quot;  The writing was smooth, the characters believable, and the love scenes were not only hot and well-done, but also unbelievably imaginative and adventurous.<br />AFTER HOURS - Stephanie Bond - &quot;Michael Pierce has always considered costume shop owner Rebecca Valentine no more than an associate - until he drops by her shop one night and witnesses the mousy wallflower's transformation into a seductive siren. Suddenly, he's desperate to know her much better. But which woman is the real Rebecca?&quot;  This was the weakest of the three stories, although it's still above-average for a novella.  The Michael character was, I think, better drawn than the Rebecca character.  The writing is good, the love scenes erotic, and the story itself was very atmospheric.

Lori Foster is one of the best at creating indelible erotic images, and &quot;Lucy&quot; is definitely one of her better stories.  Both characters were very well-developed and seemed very real to me.  I especially appreciated that Lucy was a very -real- sort of person, with insecurities about her 40-year old body (the &quot;bulges&quot; that come with age and child-bearing).  I loved it that Bram appreciated her so much for all of who she was, not just for how she looked.<br />&quot;Truth or Dare&quot; is a decent novella, with good characterization.

I became a little uncomfortable with Sam's pursuit, especially since I found it a bit unbelievable to begin with.<br />My biggest disappointment was the complete lack of real communication between the characters.  Charlie has deep-rooted fears about her ability to handle the conjunction of intimacy and commitment, and those fears are genuine.  But Rogers fails to take advantage of an opportunity for Charlie to discuss her failings and fears with Sam in a serious way.  Somehow, the obstacles between the two dissolve with no real communication and no discussion of her previous relationship, and, as a result, the ending seems trite and cliche.<br />On the other hand, Charlie and Sam are wonderful characters, and Charlie's elderly patient/friends are an appealing addition to the story.  However, the sudden relationship between Roger and Charlie's best friend was a bit difficult to take.<br />All in all, this book was a pretty standard contemporary.  I read it quickly, and enjoyed it, but was all too aware of weaknesses in the plotline while doing so.	2001-07-10

Overall, I'd rate it an average read for a romance compilation.  It wasn't terribly bad, but nothing distinguished it from the pack, either.<br />&quot;Winter's Bride&quot; by Sandra Davidson sends a romance author headlong into the 17th century, where she meets a handsome colonist.  Unfortunately, he has a secret which may separate them forever.  This story had a somewhat interesting premise, and I found Sheena and the minor characters compelling.  Unfortunately, the &quot;hero&quot; seemed unusually dim and controlling, even for an alpha-male romance hero.  The writing was good, but all in all I'd rate this story average.<br />&quot;A Cold Day in Paradise&quot; by Kathryn Hockett catapults a journalist back 100 years to save a dashing hero outlaw from the certain death at the hands of a crooked lawman.  This story was by far the weakest of the three.  The writing was uneven and sometimes difficult to follow.  Perhaps it's just this edition, but there were times when I could only imagine text had been  *omitted* -- it was *that* confusing.  The hero Lance was appealing, but the villain isn't fleshed out at all (nor did he seem reasonable), and the speed at which the story unfurled seemed *very* uneven.<br />&quot;Winter Song&quot; by Lisa Plumley sends a businesswoman back to the Wild West and hooks her up with a saloon keeper.  This story was probably my favorite of the three, with appealing characters and a fairly decent plot.  I found the insecurity of the main characters understandable, leading to a believable conflict.  The writing was decent and even, and the story moved along at a comfortable pace.<br />All in all, this book was a conventional compilation of novellas, but there's nothing in it to separate it from the huge stack of similar books in the romance genre.	2001-07-05

Alexander's writing flows smoothly, and the dialogue between the two protagonists is witty and clever.  The characters are related to characters from &quot;The Husband List,&quot; and I, for one, always appreciate revisiting characters from previous books.<br />Despite all that, this book displayed some weaknesses.  It almost seems as if Alexander decided on a plot and stuffed her characters into it despite their growth away from it!  The plot seemed old and hackneyed, and the characters, although clever and appealing, were not well-developed.  Their motivations seemed very shallow and somewhat unrealistic.<br />All in all, I'd call this book a good light read for someone who enjoys laughing out loud and doesn't mind a lack of development and realism.	2001-06-26

Also, Evanovich leaves us with another cliffhanger, and I must admit, after three of them, I am feeling slightly annoyed. Someone tell Janet that we'd buy 'em anyway! (Personally, I've been buying 'em all the first day since &quot;Two for the Dough.&quot;)<br />Despite that, there are a lot of good moments in &quot;7.&quot; In-depth character development isn't a strength of these books (I mean, we don't read 'em for that), but despite that, Ranger is subtly developed even further in &quot;7,&quot; which makes for some more interesting interactions with Stephanie. And Morelli -- well, which of us wouldn't kill for a Morelli in our lives? Grandma provides a few of those priceless Grandma moments, and the Mooner returns, hysterical as ever. And, thankfully, she doesn't have nearly as many car moments -- they were getting a big unbelievable.<br />But all in all, &quot;7&quot; was a slight disappointment. It doesn't introduce the same one-shot strong supporting characters we've seen in other books, in addition to the regulars (I mean, who can forget Sally Sweet, or the midget FTA from Five?). I enjoyed it -- it simply wasn't up to the standard set in previous books. But, in the end, let's be honest here -- mediocre for an Evanovich book is still better than most of the humdrum mystery pack.	2001-06-20

This is one of the better &quot;novella&quot; anthologies I've read in awhile.<br />Carmichael's &quot;Wheels of Love&quot; is a cute story of two people who are initially willing to marry for pragmatic reasons but find that true love is actually out there waiting.  The comedic intervention of &quot;romantic instigators,&quot; taking the form of a car and a computer, add a bit of spice, and the characterization of Samantha and the development of her relationship with Eric is especially well-drawn for a short story.<br />Barrett's &quot;Cupid's Arrow&quot; is also very charming, with wonderful development of the main character, Amanda, and her &quot;bag lady&quot; friend, Chatty.  My only complaint is that Barrett includes several different romantic impasses between Max and Amanda that aren't explained or developed, so I ended up feeling confused as to why, exactly, they were problems at all.  I know that the novella can be an impediment to such development, but even a short explanation (even an short sentence that said Amanda recognized Max's name and position) would have helped.<br />Bevarly's &quot;Top Cat and Tales&quot; was my personal favorite (although I must admit that Bevarly is one of my favorite authors of contemporary romances anyway).  I laughed out loud repeatedly as I read the tale.  I thought Cupid incredibly cute, and Abby was well-drawn and easily understood and liked.  (Personally, I wish a Joel lived in MY building!)  My only quibble is that the novella format, and the way the story developed, meant that the main characters &quot;fell in love&quot; without any real reason or provocation.<br />I thought Brownley's &quot;Winning Ticket&quot; was the weakest tale in the bunch, although it's by no means a bad story.  Speaking honestly, it was probably the story where the characters &quot;falling in love&quot; made the most sense in the novella format, since they had a relationship and memories on which to build.  But I didn't end up liking either of the characters all that much, and sometimes felt the motivations of the characters were too shallow.<br />All in all, though, this is a lovely book, full of stories I thoroughly enjoyed and will definitely re-read!

I found much to appreciate in Georgie, personally, although I had trouble liking her at the beginning.  But it didn't really seem like there was any genuine emotional development between the two characters.<br />However, it was a fun book, and it's obvious that many people enjoyed it very much.

I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews of this book!<br />While some reviewers have criticized Daisy and Nick's relationship as &quot;undeveloped,&quot; I rather thought they missed the point that the emotion between them developed long before the opening of the book.  It was simply denied by Nick at a time when he was too young and immature to understand the strength of his feelings.  Now that they've met again, and he's matured, he's able to better understand what he's feeling now, and what he was feeling back then.<br />As usual, the repartee between the main characters was snappy and humorous, and the secondary characters were well-drawn and interesting.

While I think it worked well in &quot;Wicked Widow&quot; and &quot;Lost and Found,&quot; I found myself disappointed with &quot;Slightly Shady.&quot;<br />The characters squabbled constantly, and it was difficult to see why they'd have any attraction at all for one another.  There was little character or relationship development.  While the squabbling was occasionally humorous, it made it difficult for me to believe the attraction between them.<br />The &quot;mystery&quot; was indeed interesting, although it tied together a number of coincidences that I viewed with a little disbelief.<br />All in all, it wasn't quite what I wanted in a Quick book.  On the other hand, it was entertaining, and I read through it fairly quickly.

But that shouldn't diminish the depth of characterization that is common in Richardson's books.  While there is definitely an interesting plot in &quot;GG,&quot; the book concentrates on the development of the relationship between the two characters.

It's hardly surprising, really, since this was one of her very early books, and not only has her writing matured since then, but the style of romantic writing has changed as well.<br />Laura, the &quot;heroine,&quot; is an assistant district attorney, and she comes up against Max, the &quot;hero,&quot; in the courtroom.  It's pretty much lust at first sight for her -- she's very shaken by their first meeting -- and it seems he's similar affected, since he starts immediately pursuing her despite the ethical problems of their being opposing councils in a murder case.<br />Both Max and Laura are shallow characters, and Laura, despite being a &quot;career woman,&quot; is irritatingly weak.  She allows Max to completely dominate her life, once they're together, and pretty much completely falls apart when the course of the relationship doesn't run smoothly.  On top of that, I failed to understand what she saw in Max, other than looks.  And I didn't understand exactly what Max saw in Laura, either.<br />I'd advise skipping this one, and looking into Delinsky's later work instead.  She really has matured into a marvelous writer, but this isn't the book to read unless you're a hard-core fan who wants to sample absolutely all of Delinsky's work.	2000-09-28

One thing I truly enjoy about the work of Krentz is that she is not afraid  to explore relationships between two relatively normal people.  Ah, sure,  some of her books cover typical romance relationships -- relationships  between two beautiful wealthy people, typically between a giving, loving  woman and a distrustful, emotionally scarred man.  But Krentz isn't afraid  to explore other territory -- the relationships between normal  people.<br />This particular book is one of the best examples of the  &quot;normal people&quot; relationship.  The two protoganists are friends  and co-workers who have known one another for months without any obvious  sparks.  The process of falling in love, spending time together, and  understanding that relationships take real trust and consideration, as well  as passion, makes up the heart of this book.  Of course, there is the  obvious situation, somewhat unrealistic, that brings about the climax of  the book, but that was to be expected, and I don't believe it really  detracts from the book.	2000-09-01

It appears I'm in the minority here, but I actually thought this was a  strikingly beautiful book.  Yes, I agree that Hawk's emotional baggage is  excessive, but romance novels wouldn't do much business if the characters  trusted one another and fell in love with clear communication and easily  understood emotions! :) Perhaps the metaphors were a bit excessive, but I  still found the story beautiful.<br />That said, I wish romance writers  (Lowell included) wouldn't seize on a specific &quot;theme&quot; and replay  it continuously throughout all their books.  In this case, Lowell seems  very fond of the theme of a woman selflessly giving all of herself, then  the man finally coming to his senses on the last two pages.  That theme is  repeated through this book.	2000-08-21

I read a lot of different  genres, and in every genre, there are good authors and there are bad  authors.  Johansen is a good author -- her writing flows well, and her  characters are interesting.  While I think that Johansen's work, both her  romances and her romantic suspense, grow formulaic if you read a number of  them (as I have), this is definitely one of her best.  The inclusion of  forensic sculpture and Eve's pain over her daughter's death definitely made  the story more complex than normal, and I thoroughly enjoyed the  &quot;romantic triangle.&quot;  If you're going to pick up a Johansen, make  it this one.	2000-08-08
US	52775658	R2ZDMKO4UWBTOV	0312205406	963436946	Hot Six	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Hot Six Delivers	Evanovich delivers another classic screwball novel, as Stephanie faces off against New Jersey mob guys to aid her buddy Ranger in ducking suspicion of murder.  This book definitely didn't disappoint;  Stephanie has her usual  zany, hilarious adventures.  Morelli is around, as always, trying to rein  in and protect Stephanie as she charges ahead into all kinds of wacky  adventures.  Beware, though -- Evanovich leaves us hanging with another  cliffhanger at the end!  (But it didn't make me as mad this time...)	2000-06-27

The whole book seemed shallow and convoluted, and the solution, at the end, seemed to come out of left field.  It didn't seem investigated or developed enough.  In addition, I found  myself mentally &quot;shouting&quot; at Lucas throughout, trying to nudge  him in the direction of a more fruitful investigation.  Perhaps I read too  many similar books, but it seemed untrue to the Davenport character for him  to concentrate so utterly on a fruitless investigative path.<br />Unlike some  reviewers, I didn't mind the &quot;female&quot; subplots as much, and I am  happy to see some hint of a Weather return to the series.  I was a bit  disappointed, though, that the maturation of Lucas in regards to women was  ignored in this installment.<br />Overall, I found this an enjoyable read, but  definitely not up to the standards of earlier &quot;Prey&quot; novels.	2000-06-27

In general, I'm not much on romances -- I find the formulaic plots  pretty boring.  But this one was nicely written, and had some originality.	1999-09-09

I bought this book last night, and finished it without putting it down once!  I cackled all the way through.

I've enjoyed all the Tory Bauer mysteries, and I hope to see another one soon.  I think she does a great job of creating believable characters and portraying local color.  Whenever she writes about &quot;People in the Midwest,&quot;  I find myself nodding and laughing at what she says.  No, these books don't have the psychological depth of Wendy Hornsby or Patricia Cornwell, but Wendy Hornsby and Patricia Cornwell don't make me laugh, either.  I wholeheartedly recommend these books for people who know small towns and want to laugh a lot.	1998-05-04

I thought this was one of the better Maggie books, with an intricate and interesting plot.  Wendy Hornsby has a real gift for creating characters, and she obviously has a vivid imagination as well.	1998-05-04

It ranks up there with some of my favorite mysteries!  It's a highly original creative book -- one that builds on the typical &quot;woman sleuth solves mystery&quot; but adds interesting complexity and fascinating characters to the mix.  I highly recommend this book.	1998-05-04
