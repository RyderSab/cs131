I enjoyed The Eyre Affair and so ordered this volume  and was pleasantly surprised that the second volume is as good as the first.  I'm looking forward now to the Well of Lost Plots.  This isn't great literature, of course, but highly entertaining and rewarding.  A great relief from the real world, too full of hurricanes and fires and earthquakes and terrorists!	2005-10-07

Although I really enjoyed Kitchen Confidential, I somehow thought Bourdain's writing ability might not cross over to fiction.  This isn't a mystery at all; it might be better to call it crime fiction.  His writing is direct and understated, no hyperbole, no \\"creative writing\\" attempts.  For instance when he describes sex he uses straightforward and understated rather than overdone language, and it is much more effective than more blowsy prose.  I like his sentence structure and choice of words.  I could see the action and the characters very clearly in my mind while reading the book and didn't want to put it down.  Warning though:  this is pretty violent stuff.	2005-10-04

The plot isn't much, and the ending is disappointing, but still Bourdain turns a good phrase and I couldn't put the book down.  The characters are likeable, and you care about what happens to them, although there is something uncomfortable about liking characters who are ruthless killers.  Some of the story line could have been developed further, but still this is a pretty good read.	2005-10-04

Jasper Fforde's book is very readable - which means it is entertaining and interesting enough to keep me reading the whole book.  It's a bad sign when I lose interest about half way through a book and skip the rest to read the ending.  Jasper Fforde is a better writer than that, and his wandering through time and dissolving the boundaries between reality and fiction provide plenty of opportunity for interesting plot twists. The author isn't subtle, but still pretty funny.  I got my biggest laugh out of the name of Thursday Next's supervisor - Braxton Hicks.	2005-09-29

Could have been written by Dominick Dunne, although he would have done a better job of it.  Susan Isaacs does turn a nice phrase now and then, but the emphasis on wealth, which is mentioned in one way or another on nearly every page, is shallow and boring.  I struggled through about half the book and then skipped to the end to see the outcome.	2005-09-23

Writing isn't easy, and re-writing is even harder.  So, this is a good effort by a new author, but it suffers from having a lot of style but a banal plot.  As the voice of three different people, the author is pretty convincing.  It's just that the story itself isn't very interesting.  I think it might have been a better book if it was longer, with more background about Johnny Lim's history and the background of events before, during, and after WWII.  It should have been a blockbuster, in other words.  There is plenty of material in this story, but very little of it is developed and given depth.	2005-09-13

In fact, reading a summary of Goblet of Fire, I suspect I never even finished that book!  The Half-Blood Prince starts out rather slowly, and the interaction with the Muggle Prime Minister is pointless as the Prime Minister is introduced but is never brought into the rest of the story.  That could have been omitted entirely without hurting the rest of the book, and probably should have been. <br /> <br />If the author plans to kill off someone in the next book, I hope she doesn't give any suggestion about it beforehand.  I wasn't surprised at who was killed, rather expected it since we had been warned someone significant would die.  Also, I thought the identity of the Half-blood Prince should have involved more than just a pun on the name Prince.  That revelation was something of an anticlimax. <br /> <br />Otherwise, what a good story - a pity I have finished it and don't have it to look forward to any more.	2005-07-23

Very enjoyable book - the first one I've read that is easy to understand.  I especially appreciated the author's information on the necessary technology (laptop, wireless connection, etc.) and also his suggestions on informative websites.  I checked the websites out and finance.yahoo.com is quite useful, as he said.  He also gives a few easily understandable steps to take to begin investing, and even tells the readers what to do at specific times of the day.  I found that to be especially useful, when to go online, what to look for, how to make the decision on what stocks to buy, when to sell. <br />However, this is the equivalent of a really good book on betting on the horse races.  It is still gambling.  No matter how easy it sounds, it is still taking a risk and the returns he says are possible are only that - they are not guaranteed.  The author recommends focussing on small profits, three to five percent, but the opposite is also true.  You could lose your entire nest egg three to five percent at a time.	2005-07-22

My textile-mad friend who is a spinner and knitter was more interested in this aspect.  I enjoyed seeing how the scientists deduced the origin of these mummies, not just from textiles but from historical documents, the records in ancient cities in the area and carbon dating, paths of migration - they certainly have to know a lot in order to develop the understanding of these ancient people.  For me, it is interesting that the ancestors of the Scots were also the ancestors of these mummies.	2005-05-23

This isn't the best one.  Not only do the author's scorn and bitterness weaken his writing (for instance an excessive use of quotation marks sprinkled freely on each page and a lack of editing), but it seemd to me he just doesn't have enough distance yet to have really healed.  Make no mistake, JW's are definitely into mind control, and they are really cruel in many ways.  But if you are an ex-JW looking for support and understanding, or a non-JW curious about this organization, a better book might be \\"Visions of Glory.\\"  Also, there is a wise website, virushead.net, with a more mature, compassionate response to the Watchtower organization.	2005-02-24

The prose is lush, extravagant, sensational.  The overall impression of the book is of crowded, smelly, disgusting streets filled with extremely poor, diseased, distressed people, lots of noise and movement.  The author seems to have done a lot of research and is really a better writer than many, but still the book is overwhelming and repetitive (just in case you don't get the point the author is making), and the outcome obvious, and after a while I resorted to dipping into different chapters to follow the plot, but not reading every word.	2005-02-04

It's as if the author, a minister, wanted to tame the original Rebecca (whom he would not have liked if he had met her) and turn her into a good Christian wife. <br /> <br />The characters are one-dimensional and the writing is banal.  The author kills off one of Rebecca's brothers in one chapter, and then  totally ignores it in the next chapter, which is cheerful and lighthearted.  The characters' feelings just aren't real.	2004-12-10

Evidently the first one, Mrs. Tim of the Regiment, is based on D. E. Stevenson's personal diary.  Mrs. Tim Carries On is also based on real events.    Maybe the characters are a little sacharin for modern tastes, but still the book is a pleasant read.  It's not D.E. Stevenson's best book (that is probably Sarah Morris Remembers or Miss Buncle's Book) but it is still worth reading.  It's interesting to read about how people in the U.K. reacted to the opening years of the war.	2004-11-24

However, it isn't very well written, and the characters are so unsympathetic (mostly moody and cranky) that it is hard to care about them or what happens to them.  Maybe Alison's stepfather is an exception, but even he is a caricature, a sort of Bertie Wooster trying to be a parent.  You almost expect him to say \\"cheerio\\" or some other cliche.  As a fantasy, it isn't very convincing.  There are better examples of fantasy for children, such  as \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\" which blends fantasy and ordinary reality very well.	2004-10-14

This is the first really accessible text on deep tissue massage that I have seen.  The illustrations are especially helpful and the author's descriptions of techniques very useful and easy to follow.

I would recommend it to all massage therapists who want to improve their massage skills.	2004-10-14

Mostly analysis of the writers of the bible based on the political climate and history of the time.  I found myself agreeing with the author a lot of the time, his theories make sense, could be true and sound more likely than a lot of theories about the origin of the Bible.

Forty years later, it still is a great book to read.  Did you ever notice how many English children's classics are about intensely lonely children?  That's Tom's situation at the beginning of this book, but it's not depressing.  The fantasy is very interesting, and Tom is a believable and likeable kid.

The author's books about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency are so wonderful.  One of the attractive things about those books is that no word is wasted, which is actually difficult to accomplish.  In The Sunday Philosophy Club, plenty of words are wasted.  It's boring, pretentious and disappointing. <br /> <br />In this book, the main character is a snob and an interfering busybody, and the plot is thin.  The most interesting character is the housekeeper, Grace. <br /> <br />If you were charmed by No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, skip this book.  It just isn't as good.	2004-10-03

First person fictional novels about real people are usually unconvincing - this is a long narrative of Eng's thoughts, about which the author could know nothing.  Therefore, it seems to me to be an account of how the author thinks he would feel if he were Eng - which is rather self-indulgent of the author.  Add to that the fact that the author's point of view is 20th/21st century while the events he discusses occurred in the 19th century and you see why the book is so unconvincing.	2004-05-28

I found out that chickens are wonderful pets, not much trouble, very friendly and they have personalities.  And they really eat bugs - best pest control you can have.  I read this book on the concept of the chicken tractor and realized for the suburban gardener this is ideal.  Hens eat bugs, grain, and vegetable scraps from the kitchen.  Hens are great little composters, and they eat weed seeds and pests up to and including scorpions and baby mice and snakes.  They don't need much except food and water, and protection from predators.  We allow ours to roam a fenced in yard freely, and pen them up at night.  This is a useful book if you just want a few hens and want to improve your soil (we don't move our hens around, once a year we take 4 inches off the soil in their yard and spread it around our trees and gardens.)  The eggs are great - I like giving green eggs to little kids because they all have read Dr. Seuss.  This book isn't for someone who is more interested in egg-laying or meat production on a large scale.  And, by the way, we don't eat our hens.  We are running a chicken retirement home - they don't lay eggs any more, but they still till, compost, eat weed seeds, and control pests.	2004-05-06

Very symmetrical, middle-aged        woman loses her husband AND her job to her assistant, a younger woman she  thought was her friend. Some good discussion of how someone feels when suddenly abandoned, but not convincing somehow.  At the end, she is offered her job (the younger woman couldn't hack it) and her husband (the younger woman is a mistake, the husband finds) but she turns them both down. She has a new job and she gets back her original lover, whom she left before she met her future husband.<br />Not convincing, don't get the sense that anyone in the book is real, they seem like stock characters ordered to fill up the book.	2004-04-15

In addition to this, I recommend Caroline Alexander's &quot;The Way to Xanadu.&quot;  Dalrymple follows Marco Polor to Xanadu; Alexander follows Coleridge.  Both end up at the same place, but follow very different routes to get there.  Dalrymple follows Marco Polo's route along the silk road and he shares some pretty interesting history of all the places he visits.  Alexander visits the places mentioned in Coleridge's diary in the period just before he wrote the fragment of a poem about Xanadu, which leads her to a variety of places including Florida, amazingly enough.	2003-08-22

This book described the lowest classes in India living in absolute squalor and poverty, scraping a living in the most ingenious ways, you get a picture of how strong the human spirit really is, even in the direst circumstances.  This is the background of the story about Tahir Shah's training in magic and the art of illusion.  Fascinating story, appeals to the cynic in me who believes that most &quot;spirituality&quot; is smoke and mirrors.  anyway, I highly recommend this book - what an adventure.

I'm a sucker for travel books of this sort, looking for history as well as adventure.  Although a tad slow, it is an engrossing story, humorous as well.  Like Paul Theroux, Tahir Shah goes off the beaten path, and tells the truth about people and conditions he meets.  Unlike Paul Theroux, he seems to like the people and enjoy the hardships.  And seeing the grim side of life doesn't seem to make him grim.  Anyway, I enjoyed it, and I'm going to order more of his books.	2003-07-13

Lots of distraction in the form of the Weasley twins' new joke store, new magic animals, and new teachers.<br />However, it is a good read, although I found the absence of Dumbledore throughout most of the story to be strange, I think he is one of the most interesting characters.

It's about her love affairs and the end of her first marriage.  Ruth Reichl comes across as self-absorbed and immature.  She seems to have been acting out dramas that most people go through as teenagers, although to be fair it doesn't sound as though she was allowed to be a teenager since she had to deal with serious problems such as her mother's mental illness while she was a teenager. She excuses some rather tacky behavior by claiming to have been in love.  And there was more than I wanted to hear about her sex life, written in the same low-brow style as a romance novel.  Not her best.	2001-08-20

However, we still get the feeling that he doesn't really care about the characters, the plot is disjointed, and the end reads as though the author suddenly lost interest, and left out material that would have made the end more logical.  Still, I liked it and I hope he keeps trying.	2001-08-09

The author isn't really interested in his characters, picks them up and drops them without much explanation.  The books doesn't come to a conclusion, it just ends.  It is hard to understand the characters, they are stick figures and need more flesh.  Of course, when I read the senior Theroux's books, I never really understand why he does anything, either.  They seem to want to share their views of the world, but nothing of themselves.  This is true of all of Paul Theroux's book, including my favorite, his trip through China in the Iron Rooster.  Seems to be true of the son, also.  If the main character reflects the author, I get the feeling he feels out of step with the world, but doesn't much give a damn about it, preferring to wait until the rest of the world gets in line with him.	2001-08-09

Sounded nuts to me.  Then I realized that real enlightenment might look a little nuts to the rest of us.  The author is able to explain profound truths very simply.  I found the information changing my attitudes and behavior immediately.  And he explained some things I have wondered about, for instance I have wondered about the future of the earth and the human race (which doesn't look good) and how consciousness could continue if the human race doesn't continue.  His explanation of consciousness experimenting with form makes more sense to me than other things I've read.  He also takes us gently to task, somewhat like the Dalai Lama, and doesn't allow us to make excuses for our poor habits.  This is also a good book for anyone wanting some insight on relationships.	2001-08-09

Mysteries are pretty formulaic and part of what makes them interesting is the setting, and the setting of this mystery in modern Japan is fascinating.  She also pulls off something Agatha Christie did frequently in her books - the identity of the murderer is a total surprise.  And then, when you look at it again you see the author was fair, and the evidence was in front of you all along.  Very nice.	2001-05-01

I thought it was wonderful, totally different from anything I had read before.  Because of this book, I read everything else by Ms. L'Engle that I could find and also started reading science fiction and discovered some of the wonderful authors of the time.  Recently I bought all of her books and read them again.  Now I realize that these books are more fantasy than science fiction, and about as religious as a book of popular quotations.  Her theology is very fuzzy, sugary and sentimental.  Upon reading her books, the feeling grows that the author is really removed from the real world and doesn't always know what she is talking about when it come to the grittier aspects of life.  However, all that aside, she has an understanding of teenage depression and loneliness, and that speaks to the kids who reads these books.  The characters are entertaining and likeable and it is interesting to follow them through the various books.	2001-04-22

I like reading about and looking at needlework and this book is very enjoyable.  I received two beautiful little hand made silk perfume bags from a Japanese friend, so when I saw this book I bought it to see how they are made.  I believe anyone could follow the instructions and produce these wonderful little silk origami projects, if they could find the silk!  Some of the projects are made with cotton and other easy to find fabrics, and some with beautiful silk scraps from kimonos.  I highly recommend this book if you are interested in fine needlework.	2001-04-20

I loved it, very interesting and beautiful to look at.  Almost inspired me to actually sew something, but I managed to overcome the feeling.

However, if what you want is a materially ostentatious life, the rolex, the cars, the clothes and other trappings of people who live the high life, you won't like this book because its lesson is simple:  live below your means, live frugally, save money, invest.  The authors went looking for people whose bottom line net worth was from one to ten million.  They found that these people are rarely ostentatious, and are very frugal and humble.  I found it interesting that many of them are small business owners in very &quot;dull&quot; businesses.  Also the chapters on the children of these millionaires was eye-opening.  Basically, adult children who receive cash gifts from their parents save less and spend more than children who have to make their own way in the world.  The children who know they have to be self-sufficient save more, live more frugally, and actually have more than their subsidized brethren. Very useful book, encourages us to keep on saving, stop spending, live life more fully.  Another helpful book like this is &quot;Your Money or Your Life.&quot;	2000-10-31

Simpson trial book, which was a disappointment.  In reading this scrapbook of memories, I realized that Dominick Dunne has obviously felt like an outsider and &quot;less than&quot; his whole life.  It's interesting that he thinks he worked through his demons in a cabin in Oregon, when all he did was stop drinking and start taking revenge by writing the novels about the famous people he knows.  He moved from perceiving himself as an outsider, to really being an outsider.  If he was a producer and a vice-president of a movie studio, obviously he was at that time at least &quot;in&quot; and just didn't know it.  He comes across as defensive, self-loathing, and extremely envious of people with money.  It's very sad for him, but benefits his readers because we get the inside scoop on all the gossip.	2000-09-22

Never read it on the trip, but spotted lots of Harry Potter fans reading this and the other books.  Read it finally, found  it to be pretty good, but a little boring in spots.  Also it is much darker  than the first three books, and the ending sets us up for a dark and gloomy  sequel.  I don't know if I like that, but I supposed I'll continue to read  the books anyway.	2000-07-29

He was clearly pandering to the free-love atmosphere of the 60s.  I loved and read all of his books as a teenager.  I have re-read many of them and have come to see that his thinking was often one-dimensional and predictable; patriarchal and pro-war.  However, he had a very creative mind and no matter how bad his books are, they are still readable, and they are definitely better than Star Trek.	1998-04-17

The mystery is not very convincing, but there is a surprise at the end that actually works. The protagonist is likable, reminds me of many people who are unsure of themselves, but mask it with a manner of assurance. I get the feeling that the author is sheltered, not really very experienced, idealistic, and doesn't know as much as she pretends about gangs, violence, and racism.   The whole story is a little naive, but well-intentioned, and easy/pleasant to read.	1998-02-17

The author (the book lists husband and wife as joint authors, but I am sure it was the Mr. who wrote the cookbook, and the Mrs. who typed it) claims to know the only correct version of numerous recipes, as if he had talked to the creators of the recipes in person.  However, the funniest part of all is near the end, in a recipe for homemade soap.  The author sneers that modern women are too good to make their own soap, but a hydrogen bomb would take care of that!    The text is so dense, and full of information, that reading it is like mining - and you never know when you'll come across another priceless nugget like the soap recipe.	1997-08-12

I ordered the book because I like to bake, and thought it would be informative.  UPRISINGS is informative, but it's one of those books that beats an idealogical drum.  I actually agree with the authors that Americans eat too much meat, but I don't believe that if we all became vegetarians,  the extra grain would be automatically shipped to starving people in other nations.  It's not that simple. Also, not matter how you use it, carob does not substitute for chocolate	1997-07-17
