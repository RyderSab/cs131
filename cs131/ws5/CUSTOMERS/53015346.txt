I've been wanting to write this review for a few days now.  I've been struggling with what to say so that I do justice to this amazing book.  Tempered Faith is a wonderful book for people who have lost a loved one, but I'd go farther than that to say that it's a must-read for anyone who thinks about the hard questions (ie, Why does a good God allow these things to happen?).  <br />I admired Jennifer's honesty and vulnerability in telling her story.  She tells us what she was going through and what she was thinking.  She shares with us her anger at God after her husband Jim dies in the World Trade Center on 9/11.  Each chapter is such a treasure - and as we learn how she manages to get through each day.  She tells us what things people say to her that are NOT helpful, as well as what she did find helpful.  Anyone dealing with a grieving person would benefit from this book for that reason alone.  <br />As I came to the end of the book, I felt something was missing.  I reread the title &quot;A Tempered Faith, Rediscovering Hope in the Ashes of Loss&quot; and was thinking that the book was a little light on faith part.  Then I got to the last section, &quot;A 9/11 Diary&quot;.  Oh my goodness.  This is such an amazing testimony to the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and his ability to work in our lives, drawing us closer to Himself, even in the worst of times.  We get to read about every step of the way, how Jennifer grew as a child of God.  I felt like I was reading something very personal (and indeed I was!), but I feel privileged to be able to see how God has worked in Jennifer's life.  <br />The quotes and stories at the beginning of each chapter allow us to get to know Jim Sands better, some are poignant and moving, and some are hilarious.  Also, I always apprecite it when a book has a Bibliography of recommended resources - Jennifer lists books, websites and support groups.  <br />I am a big advocate of journaling, and hopefully many people will decide to keep a record of their spiritual journey after reading &quot;A Tempered Faith&quot;.<br />God bless you, Jennifer, and thanks so much for sharing your story with us!	2004-02-13

As a woman wanting to lose weight and get in shape, I was eager to read this book.<br />She begins by talking about stress and personality type. Stress is a HUGE issue for women today, and I always find personality type discussions fascinating.  However, I much prefer looking at personality the Myers-Briggs way.  The Myers-Briggs test comes up with 16 different personality types, as opposed to only 4 personality types discussed by Florence and Marita Littauer.  Obviously, everyone is unique and no two people have identical personality types, but with the Myers-Briggs, at least you have more possibilities to work with.<br />Dr. Carter does an excellent job dealing with so many important topics in one book!  I especially enjoyed her chapters nutrition.  I liked her chapter on exercise too, but wish she had gone into a little more detail.  Overall, this is an excellent book to add to your library! <br />You can read more about Carrie Carter on her website.  I do wish she would write a book telling about her own personal health struggles.  She has Meniere's disease and has been homebound for several years, despite treatment.  She has had to stop her private medical practice, but God has used this situation in her life to give her time to write books!  As someone who lives with a chronic health problem, I'd like to hear more from Carrie about this subject!<br />Please check out my other reviews!  God bless you all, and I hope this book spurs you onto pursuing a healthier lifestyle.	2004-02-13

I'm not usually a series reader, but The Baxter Series has really captured my attention.  I've enjoyed them all, and this was no different.  When Angie Marks, complete with tatoos, unconventional hair style, and multiple body piercings arrives in traditional Baxter, she causes quite a stir.  Fortunately there is ONE person who sees the person beneath all the tough exterior. Patrick Bailey, who we met in the previous book in the series, gives her a job and takes her in.<br />This book is action-packed and difficult to put down.  This book features rattlesnakes, a murder investigation, a rocky newlywed relationship, and so much more.  And the underlying current that God loves us for who we are on the INSIDE.  I recommend all the books in this series (&quot;Tested by Fire&quot; is the first one), and am eagerly looking forward to Book 5 in the series, which I understand is the last one!  <br />You might want to check out my other reviews!!	2003-11-11

What first attracted me to this book was the fact that it won the &quot;Christy Award&quot; for the best first novel.  But what kept me reading past the first chapter was the realistic, delightful character of Erma Lee.  When we first meet her, Erma Lee has left her no-good abusive husband.  She takes her granddaughter Cher with her.  They find a town called Wiregrass, Alabama where Erma Lee finds a job, friendship and a whole new life in the person of Miss Claudia, a wealthy older lady.<br />The author shows how being a survivor of bad circumstances isn't something just for the poor - even Miss Claudia has her secrets.  This book is almost impossible to put down.  The story line is so believable, and the writing style is incredible.  I can't wait to read Michael Morris's next book!<br />Please check out my other reviews!	2003-11-11

I LOVE being able to read a short excerpt from John Piper and really get something substantial out of it without having to invest tons of time.  Even the Introduction to this book is captivating!

This type of book is my favorite - how to live the Christian life with authenticity, taking into account how REAL life is.  Not how you'd like it to be, or how it &quot;should&quot; be, but just how it is.  This book is a real winner - very thought provoking.  Be sure to allow plenty of time to read slowly, reflect, pray, and let the truths in this book seep into your soul.  <br />When I'm reading a book like this, I keep my Post-It arrows close at hand so I can mark excerpts that I want to write down or just re-read.  In this case, the book looks like a porcupine, and I still have another chapter to read!  I love how the author uses real life stories to illustrate her points.  She includes stories from her own life and others who she has counseled.  <br />Another feature of this book that I love is her extensive Notes section.  She quotes from many different authors - contemporary and classics.  She uses Henri Nouwen's works in almost every chapter.  Now I'm going to have to check out his books!<br />A must read for any woman who is trying to live her life in the meantime...

This is the third book in the Baxter series and I've read all of them right in a row.  I enjoy medical fiction, so I think this one is my favorite.  I love the suspense, and the medical details were fascinating.  I like watching the changes in the characters' personalities as the book progresses.  Especially interesting is the heart and mind of Dennis, as he cares for two newborns.  <br />Kathy Herman does an excellent job of depicting the human condition - both with and without God.<br />I agree with Harriet Klausner, who reviewed \\"Day of Reckoning\\" - she said that the books are overpopulated with minor characters.  I find all these people confusing, but I certainly wouldn't let that keep me from reading the rest of the series!  I have one more to read \\"High Stakes\\" and then a couple months' wait til #5 comes out!<br />If you're interested in more medical fiction within the Christian context, check out my reviews of Hannah Alexander's books and Harry Kraus's.	2003-10-01

I read this book right after finishing the first Baxter Series book &quot;Tested By Fire&quot;.  I liked this one better - I thought it was more compelling, harder to put down, and was written even better than the first one.  However, I'd like to add a little warning - if you are a &quot;sensitive reader&quot;, you might want to skip this one.  It's an incredible book, but there is more violence and a few shocking scenes that you might not want to read if you don't like that kind of thing. I'm not saying that it's inappropriate for a Christian novel, it's just very different from most books of its kind that I've read.<br />The topic of the story is bitterness and the evil that can grow out of grudges that are nurtured and allowed to fester and take over one's life.  There's a lesson here for all of us.<br />I can't wait to read the next in the series, Vital Signs.  Thank you, Kathy Herman, for a great series!

Kathy Herman is a first-class writer.  She gets you to care about the characters, and the story moves along quickly.  Most series continue the stories of the same characters.  In the Baxter Series, however, all 4 books (as of September 2003) are set in the same small town and seem to have the same background characters, but the major plot-line involves different characters for each book.<br />I loved the first book, but I was up late last night getting into the middle of the second one &quot;Day of Reckoning&quot; and I like that one even better!  The third one is a &quot;medical fiction&quot; book, which I love.  (See my other reviews of Hannah Alexander's and Harry Lee Kraus MD for other recommendations.)<br />This is series I can highly recommend!  I'm glad that I started reading it when 4 books are out - I hate waiting months or a year to read the next book in a series!

Hoff and I can't wait to read more.  One thing that especially struck me was her writing style and use of words.  As someone who is starting to think about writing more than Amazon reviews, I loved the words she chose and how she weaves the different characters and story lines together.  <br />In addition to the story of Susanna and her brother-in-law Michael, Hoff includes two sub-plots - one of two doctors working in New York City, and a story about an Irish family traveling to this country after hard times in their country.  These last two plots weren't as fully developed, and I look forward to reading the next book, which will no doubt get back to those characters!<br />And then there's the whole fascinating part of how the author weaves famous Christians D.L.

It seems to be an overused cliche, but in the case of this book, it was true for me!  This book is the story of a pastor and his family and what happens when he seeks glory for himself rather than drawing people to Christ.<br />His wife seems almost too perfect, however, putting up with SO much for SO long.  As the pastor gets rid of the godly Christian people in the church and brings in his yes-men, the church drifts farther and farther from the Lord.  The pastor falls deeper into sin and eventually does repent and turns his life around.<br />The one major failing of this book, in my opinion, is that Rivers should've spent more time on what happens after the pastor repents and tries to reconnect with his family.  It seems that this part is condensed in the interest of space, perhaps.  I would've liked to see more detail to this part of the book and wouldn't mind if the book were 100 pages longer to accomplish this.  I'd love to see a sequel, but I doubt there will be one.<br />Despite this criticism, I give this book 5 stars - it is a must-read!  Please check out my other reviews and God bless you!	2003-08-08

This book appears in the fiction section of libraries, but it is really non-fiction, although the names have been changed to protect the innocent (or guilty!).  I loved this book!  The stories are often hilarious, sometimes poignant and always fascinating.<br />We traveled through the Bryson City area when whitewater rafting on the Nantahala River several years ago.  It's a beautiful area of the country.  I really enjoyed Larimore's description of the beauty of God's creation in the hills of North Carolina.<br />Why only 4 stars?  I guess I wanted more from the end of the book.  Now perhaps he could only write what he experienced, but I was dying to know what Dr. Larimore did after he left Bryson City.  I also felt that I got to know his wife and daughter Kate and their new baby too.<br />If you liked this book, you might want to check out Phil Gulley's &quot;Home to Harmony&quot; fiction series about small town life.

I read a lot of Christian books, but most of them are non-fiction. I'm very selective about the fiction I read - there's just not enough time to read all the good stuff out there! I used to enjoy reading Robin Cook's medical suspense books, so I was glad to find good medical fiction novels by Hannah Alexander!<br />The first ones are a trilogy: Sacred Trust, Solemn Oath, and Silent Pledge.  I highly recommend all these!  Then the authors started a new series called Healing Touch and Second Opinion is the first book in that series.  <br />This wonderful series is centered around a small-town hospital emergency room in Missouri. The medical parts ring true for a good reason - Hannah Alexander is a pen name for a husband/wife writing team and the husband is an ER physician! These books will appeal to both men and women, and contain suspense, drama, a little romance and a lot of inspiration. The authors really make their characters come to life and you will find yourself reading quickly to find out what happens next.<br />The only downside to these books is that, as of April of 2003, there are only two books in this series!

My own piano students have enjoyed reading about Mrs. Merriweather's musical cat.  I love how the author portrays the piano teacher in this book.  Mrs. Merriwether lives an ordinary life, except on Tuesdays, when she teaches her three piano students. <br />Each student brings his/her own special personality and challenge to the lesson.  The pictures are hilarious.  When a cat comes into Mrs. Merriweather's studio, somehow the students are playing better, and the crabby neighbor is happier too!<br />The surprise ending will delight cat-lovers as well as music-lovers.<br />If you are a piano teacher, or your child takes piano lessons, this book is a must-read!<br />Happy reading!	2003-04-22

First of all, I want to thank the other reviewer of this book, who tells us that this is a TRUE STORY!  That makes it even more special.<br />Today I'm writing reviews of 4 picture books about children playing the piano.  But this one is by far the best.  The main character is Anna, who at the beginning of the book is reflecting back on her life.  You follow Anna's love of music from the time she was a child into old age. I love how the author and illustrator depict Anna's long train ride to Boston for her piano lessons.<br />As Anna grow up, she gets married and is shown playing the piano with a baby on her lap.  After her children are grown and her husband has passed away, she's still enjoying playing the piano.  <br />This book as really warmed THIS piano teacher's heart!

I've read a lot of books about what it means to live life as a Christian woman.  This one is outstanding!  Jan Winebrenner lists 17 spiritual disciplines and I thought the sections about the disciplines of secrecy and silence were fascinating.  <br />I checked this book out of the library and read it, as I usually do, armed with post-it arrows.  When I was done, the book looked like a porcupine with about 50 post-its sticking out of it.  I decided that if this book had that many excellent points, I needed to purchase it!  So now I'll reread it, with highlighter in hand this time!<br />I also recommend &quot;A Place of Quiet Rest&quot; by Nancy Leigh DeMoss, &quot;The Contemplative Mom&quot; by Ann Kroeker, &quot;Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World&quot; by Joanna Weaver, and &quot;When the Soul Listens&quot; by Jan Johnson.<br />May God bless you richly as you pursue a deep relationship with Him!<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books!	2003-04-10

At first, I thought this book would be about couples having devotional time together, but the authors look at a much broader definition of spiritual growth.  This book will help couples become closer together and closer to God, and will help facilitate good communication, which is often the #1 problem in marriage.<br />You will read about how Carolyn and Craig started setting aside time on Saturday mornings, early in their marriage, and how that has really benefited their relationship over the years (they've been married for over 28 years now).  They set aside that time to &quot;just talk&quot; and they make it a priority - they do everything possible to avoid anything interfering with that time.<br />They also talk about the &quot;S&quot; word - submission, which is such a hot topic in Christian marriage.  I really liked how they explained submission and what it means to live sacrificially.  <br />There's a lot of great ideas in this book about how to improve your communication and near the end of the book, there is one chapter mostly for women and one mostly for men.  Both are excellent.  <br />The authors are very real and don't give the impression at all that they are the perfect couple with no problems.  They tell about some of their disagreements and how they were resolved.  I think their vulnerability in their writing will help other couples a great deal!<br />I highly recommend this book!<br />You might want to check out my other reviews of Christian books and music.	2003-04-09

As a beginning scrapper, many of the magazines and idea books are overwhelming.  The layouts in those books and magazines look so professional, and are time-intensive and costly to make.  I really appreciated this book, in which Michele tells you what you need to know to get started, and helps you along the way.<br />She starts at the beginning - with how to choose supplies and how to sort your pictures.  She takes you step-by-step and after reading this book, I guarantee any beginner will be thinking, \\"I CAN do this!\\"  <br />I'm not saying this book is only for the beginner, however, there are quite a few different techniques described that would be helpful to more advanced scrappers as well.  <br />I really enjoyed the author's pages and the fact that she was sharing her own family's photos made it that much more personal and real.  The layouts in this book are do-able and realistic.  <br />I would encourage wanna-be scrappers and newbie scrappers to not get hung up about the latest trends and doing things in a particular way.  Your own style is what's right for you! There are a few basics to learn about using acid-free products, but I feel that there's too much pressure now to do fancy, \\"lumpy\\" and [extravagent] pages.  <br />I highly recommend this book!	2003-04-09

You might think you can find everything you need to know about prescription drugs on the internet.  However, I've found that certain sites give too much info (chemical structure of the medication), or too little (no warnings about side effects, etc).  This book is a great reference for prescription drugs of all kinds.  I just wish it covered over-the-counter drugs.<br />A full-color Drug Identification Guide starts out this book.  Then most of the book is an alphabetical list of prescription drugs.  I didn't have any trouble finding the ones I was looking for.  From the coumadin my mother-in-law is on, to the protonix my mom is on, to the Celebrex I take for osteoarthritis to the Allegra my daughter takes for her allergies, it's all here.<br />One of the features I like is that there is a range of dosages.  I've seen books that have NO dosages at all.  Of course, this has to be determined by the doctor for each individual patient, but it's nice to have an idea of what the range is.<br />After the section with all the drugs, there are articles on various health problems.  While that might be helpful, what I really appreciated was the 13-page \\"Disease and Disorder Index\\".  The diseases are in alphabetical order, then the drugs commonly used to treat that problem are listed below, with the page numbers where you can find more information.  With so many medications have similar names - for instance, Celebrex for arthritis and Celexa for depression, it's great to have a quick and easy way to find out what drugs are prescribed for what conditions.	2003-04-01

The format is simple - the Love List is a list of 2 things to do once a day, once a week, once a month and once a year.  Examples are:<br />Once a day find something that makes you both laugh.<BR>Once a week boost your partner's self-esteem.<br />Along with the items on the list, the Parrotts include personal anecdotes and encouragement about how to re-vitalize a tired marriage or improve an already good one.  <br />The Parrotts also do marriage conferences called &quot;Becoming Soulmates&quot; (look for the book by the same name).  Pillow Talk for Couples: Drawing Closer Before the Lights Go Out&quot; is the title of their newest book, a devotional that looks like a must-buy!<br />The Love List would be a great book for any married couple, newlyweds or golden-agers.  The authors are Christians and the book is written from that perspective, but I believe all married couples would benefit greatly!<br />Thank you, Les and Leslie!	2003-02-10

I don't need convincing about the importance of scrapbooking (or making photo albums as CM prefers to call it), but it was interesting reading about how Creative Memories got started.<br />If you're looking for inspiration to begin scrapbooking, this is an excellent book.  If you're a beginner looking for practical advice about what supplies you need to buy and how to put your first pages together, look elsewhere. Also, most people have come to expect color photos in books about scrapbooking, and this book doesn't have those.  I would love to see what some of the authors' very first pages looked like, wouldn't you?<br />I highly recommend the book &quot;Michele Berbrandt's Scrapbook Basics&quot; if you're a beginning scrapbooker (or even if you've been at it awhile!) looking for information on tools to buy, organization of supplies, cropping photos, journaling, putting together albums, and much more.  <br />Happy scrapping!	2003-02-10

I've been so looking forward to the publication of The Message Bible for so long that I wondered how it could ever live up to my high expectations!  I've enjoyed reading The Message New Testament and Psalms for quite awhile now.  <br />This Message Bible is everything I expected and more.  Genesis was the first thing I read and I couldn't believe how it flowed!  The stories came alive in such a unique way!  I've read Genesis in the NIV (my choice for Bible Study) several times recently, but reading it in The Message Bible gave Genesis a whole new breath of fresh air for me!  <br />It might seem like a small thing, but having only the chapter numbers and no verse numbers included really improves the readability.  It reads more like a regular book.  You don't tend to stop at the end of a subheading like you might normally do.  It really is hard to put this Bible down!<br />Perhaps this isn't the Bible you should use for serious studying - but for READING, and getting God's Word into you - it's awesome!  As for the paraphrase-type of translation, I have the UTMOST respect for Eugene Peterson's interpretation and scholarship and I know he did not take this responsibility lightly.  <br />Peterson is the author of many outstanding books for both pastors and laypersons.  Two that come to mind are his excellent &quot;A Long Obedience in the Same Direction&quot; (the title alone deserves a Gold Medallion Award, don't you think?) and &quot;Leaping Over a Wall&quot;, which is about the life of David.<br />&quot;Living the Message&quot; is an excellent devotional which has short, easy-to-read, but profound thoughts for each day.<br />I highly recommend The Message Bible - get it for yourself and pick up one for a friend or relative as well!<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and Bibles.  I also have a ListMania list called &quot;Great Bibles&quot; that might be helpful.<br />May the Lord bless you as you read His Word!	2003-02-10

Although this book is probably most helpful for newcomers to the Bible, I found it quite interesting.  I've been reading the Bible for about 10 years now.<br />Pastor James, teaching pastor at Harvest Bible Chapel in Rolling Meadows Illinois, does a good job of giving evidence for believing the Bible.  He includes archeological evidence, and talks about the issue of number of manuscripts, etc.  Some books that cover this material are much more lengthy and harder to read and understand.  Anyone who is interested learning more about the subject would do well to read at least parts of \\"The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict\\" by Josh McDowell.  <br />MacDonald also has a chapter on \\"Where Does the Bible Come From\\", where he touches on the canon, and how inferior writings were left out, and inspired writings were included.<br />Pastor James make a point in that chapter that I really must disagree with.  He makes the important point that the words of the Bible are not to be added to, or subtracted from.  Which is good, but then he criticizes Bibles with Study Notes, and says that we should read THE BIBLE, and not what someone says about the Bible.  Well, obviously, the Bible text itself is the important part, and I haven't seen a single Bible (and I own quite a few!) where the notes are indistinguishable from the Bible text itself, as Pastor James states.<br />I do think Bibles with study notes are a HUGE help to many Bible-readers.  I also really appreciate cross-references, which help me see that Jesus birth, death, and resurrection was foretold in so many parts of the Old Testament!<br />The author also lets us know his distaste for all the special versions of the Bible out there - The Student Bible, The Seniors Devotional Bible, The Knowing Jesus Bible, The Life Promises Bible, the Beginner's Bible - those are ones that I personally have seen, not the ones that the author mentions.  He thinks all these editions are just a marketing ploy, but I must respectfully disagree.  The Bible text in these is the same (except for the children's Bibles - surely Pastor James doesn't really think that young children should wait til they can read the NASB to be able to get into God's Word!).  <br />I think that the author could've done a little better job about telling people WHAT to read in the Bible, after he gets them motivated with this book!  He does recommend reading the gospel of John first, then 1,2,3 John, then another gospel. I think his recommendations would be better in a separate chart or an appendix or something, instead of having it as just another paragraph in the chapter.<br />This may seem like a lot of criticism for a book I rated 4 stars!  I really do think it's a great book to read - and to give to loved ones you care about who haven't yet begun the great adventure of reading God's Word and LIVING it!<br />You might want to check out my other reviews of Christian books.	2003-01-28

I absolutely loved her book &quot;The Covenant Child&quot; and I highly recommend it (see my review of that book for more info).<br />Perhaps the short novel isn't something that every good author can pull off.

I've read a string of short novels lately and this one was the best of the bunch (and if you look at my other reviews, you'll see I've read some good ones!).  <br />It's refreshing to have poignant Christian fiction written by a man.  The two main characters in this story are also men.  Most Christian fiction seems to be aimed at women, unfortunately, so this was freshing.  Another reviewer mentioned that he was going to purchase copies of this book for high school graduation gifts, and I think that's an excellent idea!<br />The story begins when almost 20-year-old Alan reluctantly agrees to spend a week caring for his dying grandfather in a small town in the mountains of Montana.  There has been some distance between Alan's father and his grandfather, and during Alan's stay, he learns the reasons for this through a series of 8 stories his grandfather has written, to go along with 8 gifts that are under the tree.  Grandpa has told Alan he can choose one as his Christmas gift.<br />Maki's depiction of these characters is outstanding.  You really know these characters.  It's wonderful to see the young man in the story grow in compassion through this book.  Their relationship is precious.  This book isn't predictable or sugar-sweet.  It's just perfect and I highly recommend it.  Don't wait til next Christmas - read it now - and while you're at it, get in some early Christmas shopping and buy a few copies for friends and family!<br />You might want to check out my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2003-01-16

I heard about this book by listening to WMBI in Chicago the week before Christmas.  They had the author on, telling one Christmas carol song per day.  Immediately I purchased the book, and am thoroughly enjoying it!<br />Ace tells the stories of 31 favorite Christmas songs.  They aren't all traditional carols, but include &quot;Mary Did You Know&quot;, and a couple of secular-based Christmas songs such as &quot;Silver Bells&quot; and &quot;Rudolph&quot;.  I would love to know where Mr. Collins got all his information - there is no Bibliography.<br />The book itself is very attractive - you can see what the cover is like above, but inside, the print is a deep blue, and there are simple drawings and borders using the same blue.  This makes it very visually appealing.  <br />The best way to read &quot;Stories Behind the Best-Love Songs of Christmas&quot; would probably be to read one chapter per day for the 31 days before Christmas.  But you can also read it straight through, or dip into the chapter that talks about YOUR favorite Christmas song.<br />As a perfect companion to Ace Collins' book, I recommend &quot;Christ in the Carols&quot; by Christopher and Melodie Lane.  In this book, the emphasis is on finding Christ in the carols and how these carols express so beautifully the glorious and mysterious incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ!<br />Take the time out this Christmas to enjoy the history and meaning of these beloved songs of Christmas!

The first book I read by Dr. Harry Kraus was &quot;Could I Have This Dance?&quot;.  It was just outstanding, so I had high expectations for this book as well.  And I was not disappointed!  As a fan of Robin Cook's books from way back, I was thrilled to find this genre under the umbrella of Christian fiction.  <br />This book is difficult to put down - the plot twists and turns and Dr. Kraus' characterization is excellent - you really feel like you know the characters.  I especially liked his depiction of Travis, the son of the main female character, Beth.  I felt that the book was realistic and wasn't one of these in which everything is perfectly resolved by the end of the book.<br />There are several of Harry Kraus' earlier books that I am looking forward to reading!

Like the other reviewer said, this book is best read in one sitting, but I didn't have the time to do that.  But I did read it in a day, a chapter here and a chapter there.  <br />The author is just outstanding at description.  The way she depicts her characters...  well, let's just say that you really come to know and love Merilee and Nora and Steven too.  The characters really come alive.  <br />I am a journal-keeper, so I loved the fact that Jane Orcutt used Merilee's journal in the story!

The author uses the technique she did in her \\"Ribbon of Years\\" novel - she intersperses the present-day story line and flashback segments which took place in the late 1970's.  This is an interesting technique and does help keep the reader's interest up.<br />However, when it comes to fiction, I'm looking for something more than an interesting story that keeps you reading.  I really felt that the characters could have been much more developed.  I also found it quite predictable.<br />I love to read, and I read mostly non-fiction - I'm careful how I \\"spend\\" my reading minutes. In Christian fiction, I'm looking for something a bit deeper than just a nice story. I'm not saying that this book is shallow, but maybe I'm pickier than the typical Christian fiction reader.<br />Fans of this author will enjoy the short preview of Robin Lee Hatchers' upcoming book \\"New Wine: A Love Story\\" which will be coming out in the fall of 2003. <br />You might be interested in my reviews of other Christian books and music!	2002-11-15

In this case, however, I'm so excited to recommend this book that I can't wait!  In the Introduction, Elisabeth Elliot explains this book is a compilation of short articles that have appeared in her newsletter over the past 10 years or so.  <br />I've only read 7 of the 2-4 page devotionals, but each one was excellent, and 2 of those have been life-changing.  God has used them to speak to me right where I'm at, in such a powerful way!  I can't wait to read the rest of the book, but I'm savoring it, reading only a couple chapters a day, so it's not over too quickly!  <br />The chapters that mean so much to me are &quot;Shoes of Iron&quot; and &quot;The Future is Not Our Province&quot;.  I spent two days of my journaling/Bible study/prayer time journaling about &quot;Shoes of Iron&quot; and looking up related writings in other devotionals, etc.  The more I read and wrote, the more I learned.  I expect &quot;The Future Is Not Our Province&quot; to similarly inspire me when I sit down with pen and paper.  These two devotionals alone would be worth the price of the book!  At the end of each devotional, Elisabeth includes a quote from a Christian writer, mostly from long ago.  It's fascinating to see how the writings of someone who lived in the 1600's relate so closely to how God is working in my life today.  These quotes and prayers are a good jumping-off-point to learning about Christian classics.<br />This book would make an excellent gift for either the serious student or a busy person who has limited knowledge and/or time to meet with God.  The chapters are meaty without being difficult to understand.  <br />If you haven't read Elisabeth's book &quot;Through Gates of Splendor&quot;, you should do so!  In it, Elisabeth tells the story of how her husband Jim Elliot and several other men were martyred in the jungles of Ecuador in the late 1950's by the Auca Indians who they were trying to reach with the gospel.  Her faith is so inspiring and the fact that she took her young daughter back down there to work amongst those people is nothing short of miraculous.  <br />If you enjoy &quot;Secure in the Everlasting Arms&quot; half as much as I did, you will be richly blessed!

I own a lot of Bibles, but when I saw this one, I knew I had to add it to my collection.  For one thing, I didn't have another Bible with the Contemporary English Version translation.  It is an easier translation to read and I agree with some of the other reviewers that it's probably not the best version for serious Bible study, but I think to disregard this Bible because of that would be a serious mistake.<br />I encourage you to use Amazon's wonderful \\"See Inside\\" feature to see what this Bible has to offer.  It is SO colorful!  The notes are in the margins rather than at the bottom of the page.  The notes are categorized by icons for Geography, People & Nations, Objects, Plants and Animals, History & Culture, Ideas & Concepts, and Cross references.  <br />What this Bible has that I've never seen anywhere is the pictures and photos that really help you understand the text!  Just in the past couple of days, I've found these features helpful in my own study:<br />In Genesis 48, Jacob blesses Joseph's sons (remember when Isaac blessed Jacob? There are similarities).  There is a large color photo of the Rembrandt painting (1656) of this event!<br />I was reading Hebrews 11, the Hall of Faith.  This Bible has a large chart of 13 people mentioned in Hebrews 11, along with what they did, and where in the Bible you can read the whole story.  On the next page, there are photos of two \\"stone ceiling boxes\\" in Norwich Cathedral in England, depicting Noah's Ark and Moses in the Bulrushes.  You'll learn about how the ceiling was put on this 15th century cathedral!<br />In Exodus 12, there is a picture of the hyssop plant that was used by the Israelites to paint blood on their doorframes during the first passover.  You'll also learn that the hyssop plant was mentioned in Psalm 51 - David asked that God wash him with hyssop (after his sin with Bethsheba) and then he will be whiter than snow.<br />This Bible has excellent articles about How the Bible Came to Us, What Books Belongin the Bible and why, the different kinds of literature found in the Bible, the history of Bible translation, and a great article about Biblical archeology!<br />I got the paperback version and it weighs 4 pounds!  It is also wider than any other Bible I own, so it's a little unwieldy to have in your lap!  You might consider getting the hardcover, or studying this Bible at the desk or table.<br />My favorite Bible for study is the NIV Study Bible, but this one will be right by my side to add visual interest and broaden my learning greatly!<br />Please check out my other reviews.  I also have a Listmania List of favorite Bibles.  I think I'll need to make a new Listmania List of some more great Bibles!  May God bless you in the study of His Word!	2002-11-09

First of all, I have to tell you that I'm really don't read much fiction at all.  My preference in books is Christian non-fiction, mainly Christian Living books, devotionals, books on prayer, and the like.  <br />But I did pick this book up and I had a very hard time putting it down.  This is the story of twin girls whose father dies and they find themselves going from a very nice well-provided-for life to being treated horribly and not even having basic needs (clean clothes, decent food, and a clean bed to sleep in) met!  The money-hungry grandparents get custody of the girls early in the story and most of the book takes place during those 15 years between the time the girls were 3 and when they turn 18.  <br />As another reviewer says, this is a modern day parable.  Your heart will ache for these girls and what they are missing.  I felt anger and resentment towards these people who took care of them.  Terri Blackstock is an excellent writer and you will find yourself very engrossed in this book within the first couple chapters.  You might want to make sure you have plenty of time to read before starting this book, because it's very hard to put down!<br />Of course I won't give you any hints about how it ends - you'll have to read the book yourself!<br />This book is in a series of unrelated novels by different authors under the umbrella of &quot;Women of Faith Fiction&quot;.  I realized what makes these books special after I had finished the book and then came across a good-sized section of discussion questions!  These would be probably best-used in a group setting, but of course can be used as individuals as well.  The questions relate the plot of the book to concepts from the Bible.  There are passages to look up and insightful questions to discuss.  I highly recommend doing these questions, with a group or by yourself.<br />This book would make a perfect choice for a Book Discussion group!  And it isn't preachy, so the group wouldn't have to be made of solely of Christians.<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2002-10-03

I'm about 2/3 of the way through this book, but I can't wait til I'm done reading it to post my review of this awesome book!  Timothy Jones covers the whole range of topics related to prayer.  When I'm reading a book such as this, I put those Post-It arrow flags in it to mark parts that I might want to copy into my journal, or reflect more on, and right now, this book has about 40 Post-Its sticking out of it!  It's a library book, so I think I'm going to have to buy this one!<br />Timothy Jones speaks in everyday English, yet his style is poignant and whimsical!  I love his writing style!  He talks about how to pray - no formula stuff for him.  He talks about how to be STILL and QUIET in the midst of a busy life.  He talks about how prayer doesn't even have to be words formed in your mind.  He tells about those desperate HELP! prayers and how God hears them all.  He covers such issues as why we should pray when God is all-knowing and is going to do what he's going to do anyway, what to do when we feel that our prayers go unanswered, and many more issues.<br />I've read quite a few books on prayer, but this is my favorite so far.  I also highly recommend Timothy Jones' other books \\"Awake My Soul: Practical Spirituality for Busy People\\", \\"Prayer's Apprentice\\", and \\"21 Days to a Better Quiet Time with God\\".  There are probably more, but these are the one I own.<br />Timothy Jones is the kind of person that you'd just love to sit down with over a cup of coffee - he's real and authentic and isn't afraid to tell about his own human failings and his own experiences with prayer.<br />Take a look at this book, by using Amazon.com's Look Inside\\" feature!<br />You might be interested in reading my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2002-09-25

Lisa Beamer is able to face life without her husband and even be optimistic about her future and the future of her three small children because of her strong faith in Jesus Christ.  Lisa gives us background information about both her own and Todd's families growing up.  Lisa's father died suddenly when she was only 15, and that experience probably prepared her to deal with what was to come on 9/11/01.<br />Immediately before September 11th, Todd and Lisa took a trip to Rome, arriving back home late on September 10th.  While they were away, Lisa was preparing to lead a Bible Study on the book of Esther.  She came upon this passage as she read the cross-references:<br />Romans 11:33-36<BR>\\"Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!  Who has known the mind of the Lord?  Or who has been his counselor?\\"<br />This was a verse Lisa knew well because this was one that helped her get through the death of her father.  Little did she know when they were on that vacation how this verse would speak to her again in the days and weeks to come.<br />Lisa is very honest and open about her husband Todd.  He was a wonderful husband and father, but he also had a problem with loving his job so much that he'd sometimes spend too much time working.  She talks about how they worked that out.  <br />It was a few days after the crash before Lisa talked to Lisa Jefferson, the Verizon Airfone operator, who Todd had the famous conversation with.  What a comfort this was to Lisa, to hear what Todd's concerns were during the last minutes of his life.  He told the operator to tell Lisa he loved her and the children, and Todd asked her to say the Lord's Prayer with him and they recited the 23rd Psalm also.  Lisa Jefferson was on Larry King Live recently and said that the phone call was actually 45 minutes long!  She has a hard time sleeping still, after being the recipient of this phone call that told so much about the crash of United flight 93.  <br />Lisa believes that God COULD have prevented the tragedy of 9/11.  He could've chosen to pull Todd off that plane.  But rather than drive herself crazy with wondering \\"what if\\", she chooses to rest in the knowledge that for some reason, God allowed these things to happen.  Allowed, not caused. Big difference.  <br />And God used Todd and many other heroic people on that flight to save the lives of still more people who could've died in the Capitol building or the White House.  <br />Lisa tells the story of how the hymn \\"It is Well With My Soul\\" was written by Horatio Spafford.  Mr. Spafford lost his four daughters in a freak accident where a ship sank in the Atlantic Ocean.  While he traveled that same route to join his wife, who had survived the accident, in England, he wrote:<br />\\"When pace live a river attendeth my way,<BR>When sorrows like sea billows roll;<BR>Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,<BR>It is well, it is well with my soul.\\"<br />I highly recommend this book to you.  And you can feel good that all the proceeds from the sales of this book (and the companion music CD) will go to the Todd Beamer Foundation. The monies will go towards developing character and heroism in faith in this country's children, which special emphasis on the children who lost a parent on September 11th.<br />Please check out my other reviews of books and CDs!	2002-09-13

Dee Henderson's books seem to be flying off the shelves of bookstores and libraries and everyone seems to love them!  This is the first one I've read - since there was a prequel, I decided to start with that one.  <br />Now it appears that this book was just re-released (my copy doesn't have the same cover)and was written earlier, before the O'Malley series.  Perhaps that accounts for the fact that it's slow-moving and not as compelling as everyone thinks Dee's books are!<br />I don't read a lot of Christian fiction (see my reviews for what I do read!), and I'm very selective, so perhaps I was just expecting more.  The suspense isn't very early in the book and it's not all that suspenseful.  The romance was okay, but I guess I was looking for more of a plot.  I thought the end would be more exciting than it was.  <br />People tell me that the O'Malley series is better and I think I'll give &quot;The Negotiator&quot; a try!	2002-09-05

The pictures are breathtaking and the maps are excellent (of course - they're by National Geographic!).  They also tell you how many miles this particular route is, and how long it will take.  For each of the 200 spectacular drives, the book lists not-to-be missed highlights such as rivers, overlooks, museums, and other interesting landmarks that you might not see if you hadn't read this book.<br />The way I used this book was to decide what area of the country we wanted to go to, then I looked up the different drives and after I found a few good ones, THEN I used the trusty Mobil Travel Guides!<br />Buy this book - you'll love it!  <br />Happy traveling!	2002-05-31

It lists 77 towns - the maps are great of course, the pictures are captivating, and they tell you what's so great about the town, where to stay, where to eat, and even where to shop, if you're so inclined.  <br />I can speak for only two of the destinations listed in the book, but both of them are fantastic.  We've been to Ephraim, Wisconsin (in Door County) twice now and we're going back too!  The other town we've been to is Ouray, Colorado.  Even though we were just passing through there, and only got to stop for lunch, I can see where this town is a great destination all its own.  <br />Get this book, pick a location, and pack up the car and you'll have a great vacation!<br />Happy traveling!	2002-05-31

This book is not just a book of great layouts, though it certainly has those!  And it's not just tips on journaling either.  Joanna Campbell Slan does an outstanding job of teaching you how to tell the stories behind your pictures.  <br />The layouts are wonderful, and not as impossible-looking as so many layouts are in other books!  But what's important is that she shows how scrapbooking can be used for SO many situations.  It's not just a hobby for moms with young children.  <br />I really enjoyed reading this book, and looking at her layouts.  She shares a lot of her own scrapbook pages and by the end of the book, we get to know her son Michael and we feel better equipped to scrapbook the stories of OUR lives.<br />There was a poignant section about scrapbooking the not-so-good memories.  Joanna uses her photos and journaling to create a memorial page for her nephew Josh who was killed just before his 5th birthday.<br />Probably the most helpful part of the book is all the journaling/storytelling tips!  The author even includes questionnaires to fill out as you interview your family members.  I enjoyed the fact that the layouts are graded by how easy/difficult they are.  You can look that up in the index and also see what materials are necessary.  <br />By the end of the book, I really feel that I had gotten to know Joanna quite well - and isn't that the goal of our scrapbooks, to share ourselves with future generations?<br />Also, Joanna has a website ... where you can download templates, access helpful hints, and link to other scrapbooking websites.<br />Happy Scrappin'!	2002-05-30

I got this book at the public library and I've really enjoyed looking through it!  There are lots of GREAT ideas in here.  However, most of these techniques aren't for beginning scrapbookers (like me).  <br />I did pick up some helpful tips, but please be aware that much of this book is about creating a piece of ART from your cropped pictures.  While I loved some of the looks, many of them are so elaborate that take away from the picture which I've always felt should be the focal point of the scrapbook page.  <br />The author does include some basic information on reproducing your pictures for cropping (scanning, using Kodak Picture Maker, getting prints from negatives, taking a picture of a picture, color copying, etc) and also there are good instructions of some basic techniques such as framing and silhouetting.  I really like the looks of the partial silhouette on page 34 and this is something I might actually try.<br />At the end, there are some techniques which require real artistic ability, in my opinion - at least some good technical and proportional drawing skill!  There are also some interesting-looking layouts using illusions and even some where there are animal heads on people's bodies and vice versa.  While these are interesting to look at, I wouldn't put this kind of layout in my scrapbook!  But to each his own!<br />Happy Scrappin'!	2002-05-30

This book consists of 100 short, two-page chapters, each featuring a prominent person and the Bible verse that changed his/her life.  The book is in chronological order - the first chapter is about Paul the Apostle and the last is Joni Eareckson Tada.  Not all the people in this book are theologians (indeed not all of them are good examples, as the disclaimer at the beginning of the book explains.  There are explorers, scientists, rulers of countries, authors, and inventors.  <br />Use this book as a devotional, reading one chapter per day.  You might want to look up that Bible verse and read the chapter of the Bible that contains it.  Do a study of that verse using other books (see my other reviews and Listmania lists for more books about the Bible).  Look up that verse in another devotional's Scripture Index.<br />This book is also a great introduction to 100 famous people.  The chapters give you some background information and make you hungry for more information about them.  This book can be a springboard for lifelong learning!  Certain people will intrigue you and you can do further reading on those individuals.<br />Books like this one with short snippets are most easily used when they have good indices.  There are many good devotional books without a Scripture Index!  This one has both a Scripture Index and a Person Index.  Want to know whose life John 3:16 changed for instance?  Dwight L Moody!  What was Martin Luther's favorite?  Romans 1:17  &quot;The just shall live by faith.&quot;  And since the book is laid out chronologically, you can search for someone by the time during which they lived.<br />The father/son writing team that put this book together has written many other great books - both together and separately.  Recent ones that are especially good are 100 Christian Books that Changed the Century, The One Year Book of Psalms, and The Family Book of Bible Fun.<br />These books provide endless hours of enjoyable reading and spiritual growth.  Put this book on your coffee table and you'll find that people will be intrigued and pick it up.

I prefer Christian non-fiction.  However, this one caught my eye.  This is the first book by Penelope Stokes that I've read and I think I'll be reading more!<br />The book has an interesting and very unique premise.  After a thunderstorm that affected her computer, Vita (a travel writer who hates to travel) finds that her computer's operating system has been taken over by a strange new program called Treasure Box.  As the story unfolds, Vita is consumed by the lives of inhabitants of her computer's story.  There are similarities to her own life, but many differences.<br />Just as the main character can't wait to get back to the computer to see what the next &quot;chapter&quot; of this computer program has to say, you won't be able to wait to get back to this book!  <br />I was a bit confused by the end - I think it came together a bit too quickly and I had a hard time following what was real and what wasn't.  But the end result of the Treasure Box program WAS clear, and Vita's life is changed as a result.<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and Christian music!	2002-03-12

It's not difficult reading, but this type of prayer is not something that you can just assimilate into your Christian walk without considerable thought and prayer. I really appreciated the author's honesty and her vulnerability. She definitely doesn't paint herself as being a person who has mastered this stuff - she is just another pilgrim on the journey, and indeed her points are more credible to me because she isn't perfect.<br />The book talks about what contemplative prayer is, what it looks like in someone's life, problems we might encounter - really practical stuff. She used personal anecdotes to illustrate her principles, and also quotes from many sources. I must say that I found the \\"notes\\" section at the end of each chapter fascinating. As a lover of Christian books, I'm fascinated by the books that an author refers to. And this book has the notes at the end of each chapter, instead of the all of them being at the end of the book. They're more accessible this way, I think.<br />I especially appreciated Jan's description of how we can practice a contemplative lifestyle in the busy-ness of life. She is quick to dispel the notion that contemplatives are locked away in a room somewhere, not living a normal life. <br />I own Jan Johnson's other books - \\"Enjoying the Presence of God\\", \\"Listening to God - Using Scripture as a Path to God's Presence\\", and \\"Living a Purposeful Life\\", and I look forward to reading those as well. <br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music.	2002-03-03

I'm very selective about the fiction I read - there's just not enough time to read all the good stuff out there! I used to enjoy reading Robin Cook's medical suspense books, so I was glad to see this series of three medical/suspense Christian novels.<br />This is the second of a series - the first is Sacred Trust and last is Silent Pledge. Reading them in order is highly recommended!<BR>This wonderful series is centered around a small-town hospital emergency room in Missouri. <br />The medical parts ring true for a good reason - Hannah Alexander is a pen name for a husband/wife writing team and the husband is an ER physician! These books will appeal to both men and women, and contain suspense, drama, a little romance and a lot of inspiration.

This book is a MUST-BUY if you're a Christian couple planning your wedding!  H. Norman Wright has written many books on marriage, but this one is unique.<br />I gave this book to my daughter and her fiance a few months before the wedding.  They used this book to get ideas for writing their wedding vows.  There is also a section of Scriptures that are good ones to use for a wedding.  My daughter and her husband used Colossians 3:12-17.  So many couples seem to have 1 Corinthians 13 (the \\"Love Chapter\\") almost by default.  Come up with something different - something that really suits the two of you!<br />Right now I'm listening to the author of this book on Moody Broadcasting's MidDay Connection.  ... .

He especially enjoyed the books by Dallas Willard and Richard Foster on spiritufl discplines.  He calls this book &quot;Dallas for Dummies&quot;.  But it is far from stating the obvious or dumbing down the essential truths of spiritual disicplines.  <br />Before reading this book, I read Ortberg's latest book &quot;If you Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get out of the Boat&quot; - I really enjoy the author's conversational style.  He tells stories about other people and about his own life, which really serve to drive home the point he's trying to convey.<br />John makes himself vulnerable and transparent in discussing his own sin and failings, which makes him more credible!  <br />The three chapters that impaced me the most are #3 about the truth of spiritual disciplines, #4 about &quot;the practice of celebration&quot;.  The last chapter is entitled &quot;The Experience of Suffering&quot;.  I will definitely be re-reading these chapters.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in growing in their faith.<br />You might be interested in checking out my reviews of other Christian books.	2002-01-24

This book was written by Carol Cymbala, wife of Jim Cymbala, pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle.  Carol directs the well-known Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir.  This choir itself is an amazing testimony to God's love the faithfulness.<br />In this book, Carol Cymbala gives examples from her life that show God's faithfulness.  It is very inspiring.<br />Carol was/is very shy and with the Lord's help, but overcame that and was able to fulfill God's purposes for her life.  A few of the stories were also told by Jim in Fresh Wind Fresh Fire, but it's interesting hearing it from another person.  <br />Carol makes herself vulnerable and talks about her own failings and disappointments.  Her honesty is refreshing and makes it easier to identify with her.  <br />In this book, you will about what happens when the people of God fully surrender their lives to Jesus.<br />A 6-song audio CD is included inside the back cover of the new books - the title song &quot;He's Been Faithful&quot; really brings this book to life.<br />Read this book soon - it will most likely change you view of how God might be working in your life!  <br />Please check out my reviews of other Christian books and music.	2002-01-24

The Brooklyn Tabernacle is close to the WTC and people came by the Brooklyn Tabernacle as they dazedly walked away from the ruins at ground zero.  The church quickly mobilized to offer passersby cups of water, spiritual comfort, a place to worship and pray, etc.<br />At the beginning of the book, Pastor Jim Cymbala tells how he couldn't sleep that Monday night, 9-10-01.  This was unusual for him and there seemed to be no physical reason for this.  As he lay in bed, this verse came to mind - Proverbs 10:5:<br />&quot;He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son.&quot;  After hours of reflecting on this verse, Jim came to the conclusion that it's harvest time in New York City and he must find a wsay to reach its people for Christ.  <br />This book tells stories of Brooklyn Tabernacle attenders who lost people in the WTC and people who were miraculously spared.  Jim Cymbala describes this whole event as a wake-up call to our nation.<br />This book is a must-read if you've read any of Jim Cymbala's other books.  <br />Please check out my reviews of other Christians books!	2002-01-24

This one is no exception.  James has been called the Proverbs of the New Testament.  Martin Luther didn't think it belonged in the Bible because of it's emphasis on good works!  This short book, written by James the brother of Jesus, is a goldmine of instruction on how to live as a mature Christian.<br />Warren will lead you through the book bit by bit and your study of James will be oh so much richer as a result.  I'm studying James with my small group Bible Study and I'm getting so much more out of our study because of &quot;Be Mature&quot;!<br />If you're interested in reading more of Warren's commentaries, you might want to check out Bible Exposition Commentary Set (Volumes 1 &amp; 2), which is a compilation of ALL of Wiersbe's &quot;Be Series&quot; books on the NEW TESTAMENT.  He's not quite done writing all the commentaries on the Old Testament, then hopefully we'll have a 2-volume set containing those as well.<br />This commentary is easy to understand - definitely written for laypersons.

But I'm thinking of buying several copies to give as early Christmas gifts next year.  <br />This book is not merely a collection of thoughts about the birth of Jesus, it goes deep into what a relationship with the Wonderful Counselor can mean in our lives.  Each of the 14 meditations focues on a Scripture passage - these are very diverse.  The Scriptures range from the foretelling of Jesus' birth by Isaiah to &quot;The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us&quot; in John's gospel.  There is a selection from Jonah 2 &quot;From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you heard my cry.&quot;  There are passages from Hebrews, Romans and Psalms.  <br />This book has been a real blessing to me as I've read it during this Christmas season.  I will definitely be re-reading some of these chapters.  The chapter I'm reading now has an excellent discussion on how we can rely on the Wonderful Counselor to seek God's will for our lives.<br />Larry Libby and Steve Halliday did an excellent job on this book - I'll definitely be looking for other books by them!<br />Please check out my reviews of other Christian (and Christmas) books.	2001-12-25

My children are in their late teens and early 20's and this is probably one of the books they enjoyed the most when they were little!  I really hope all the books in this series get reprinted!  <br />If you can get hold of a copy of this book, buy it while you can!  You'll love it!  <br />Mr. and Mrs. Pig have their hands full with 10 young piglets and they decide to go out for the evening.  They get a sitter from &quot;the agency&quot; and leave the house.  The sitter is dressed up like a woman, but your children will see that she is indeed a WOLF!  Yes, a wolf babysitting for the piglets!  After she gets them to bed, she preheats the oven and decides to try to catch Garth, the youngest pig.  <br />While this may sound like a very frightening book, your kids will love it!  The antics of the pigs as they save their brother Garth and send the babysitter packing will keep you laughing.  <br />Please also look for Garth Pig and the Ice Cream Lady where the pigs send Garth out to get ice cream from the ice cream vendor who - you guessed it - turns out to be a wolf!  The story ends happily ever after, but not before Garth goes for a terrifying ride in the ice cream truck and the other pigs use their ingenuity to outsmart the Ice Cream Lady.	2001-11-16

Warren Wiersbe's Commentaries are in-depth and intellectually-stimulating, while being understandable and enjoying to read!<br />These two books are the compilation of Wiersbe's \\"Be Series\\".  You can find these books individually in paperback - one for each book of the Bible (sometimes there are two per book - for John and Acts, or one book for several small books of the Bible at the end of the New Testament).  While it is probably easier to carry around one small paperback for the book of the Bible you're studying, you can't beat the price for this two-volume set, which includes the complete text of 23 of Wiersbe's New Testament Commentaries.  (...)<br />This is an invaluable resource for anyone wanting to better understand the Bible.  Warren Wiersbe's commentaries read like a letters from a good friend.  You will find yourself looking up one passage, but continuing to read because it's so good!<br />You may wonder if Warren has written commentaries for the Old Testament books.  He has written a lot, but not all of them yet.  You can buy many of them individually, and you can also buy \\"The Bible Exposition Commentary - Pentateuch\\" which was published in January of 2001.  This includes all the \\"Be Series\\" for Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Genesis has 3 \\"Be Series\\" books!   I hope that someday there will be a two-volume set for the Old Testament commentaries as well!  <br />Warren Wiersbe is my favorite commentator, and when I'm confused about a Bible passage, I automatically say to myself, \\"Let's see what Warren has to say about this one!\\"<br />You might be interested in my other reviews of Bibles, Christian books, and Christian music.

While it should not be the only Bible you read, or the Bible you take to church with you, this is unique and can help you GREATLY in understanding the order of events in the life of God's people.<br />The 4 gospels are put into one long story called &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;.  This is a HUGE help!  You can so much more easily take in all that the Bible tells us about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!  In the Old Testament, the author combines the events of Samuel, the Kings and the Chronicles - most layment are confused by these books and if you're reading them in order, you'll find yourself saying &quot;Didn't we cover this already?&quot;.  Having it all put together in one story is so helpful!  <br />F. LaGard Smith includes some &quot;devotional commentary&quot;, which is clearly marks as such.  He also divides The Narrated Bible into daily readings for those wanting to read this through in a year.  The sun icon tells you you've reached the end of that day's reading.  If you want this same text to be divided up by date (like the One Year Bible), you can get &quot;The Daily Bible&quot;.  <br />You will find the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah put into their historical context - I believe that your faith will be enriched and your understanding improved by this wonderful book!<br />Oh, something important to mention is that you can always easily find exactly what verse you're reading.  The reference is in the margin, and in the case of the Gospels, all references to that event are noted, with reference used by the wording of the passage is highlighted in bold.<br />There is also a complete index, so you can quickly find any verse in the Bible.

She is from England, and she and her husband Stuart (also a prolific writer) live in the Milwaukee area, where her husband is pastor of Elmbrook Church.<br />Jill and Stuart came to our church this summer and gave a series of talks.  Jill talked about prayer, and the material was taken from her book &quot;Prayer that Works&quot;.  There are LOTS of books on prayer, but this one is really special.  Her writing style makes you feel like you're sitting down for a cup of coffee with Jill, and she's just sharing her experiences with you.  To be honest, I'm only on the second chapter of this book!  I tend to read more than one book at a time, and &quot;Prayer that Works&quot; deserves a lot of attention! Jill has a way of telling stories from her life (often humourous ones at that!) and making them so applicable.  You'll remember the story, but even more, you'll remember the point of the story.<br />There are questions at the end of each chapter, and I highly recommend taking the time to get out a notebook and write down your thoughts and answers to the questions as you go along.  You will learn so much more from the book because of it. This book takes some of the lessons from the lives of Elijah and Elisha and applies them to our lives.  <br />A couple of the quotes that really have struck home with me are: <BR>&quot;Learn to pray in the middle of the muddle, or you'll have a muddle in your middle.&quot;<br />&quot;Meet with God without an agenda&quot; - what was the last time you met with God without a &quot;To Do&quot; list for Him?  Leave it up to Him what is best!  <br />&quot;We must learn to pray in the dark&quot; - if we wait til things get better, we could be waiting for a long long time!<br />Jill and Stuart have a radio ministry called &quot;Telling the Truth Ministries.&quot;  You can go to oneplace.com and then go to ministries and click on &quot;Telling the Truth&quot;.  That way you can listento some of Jill and Stuart's radio messages.  if you have heard Jill speak, when you read her books, then you can &quot;hear&quot; her voice as you read the book.<br />Thank you and God bless you, Jill and Stuart, for your ministry in books and in radio.  This helps people throughout the country (and indeed throughout the world!) benefit from your wisdom about this journey we call the Christian life.<br />You might want to check out my reviews of Christian books and music.  Also, Jill has a new book called &quot;Faith Enough to Finish&quot; about Jeremiah.

How do we know God's will for our lives?  How do we listen?  How does He speak to us?  Are we doing something wrong?  Does God REALLY care about the small details of our lives here on earth?  <br />These are big questions and so essential to our Christian lives.  There are LOTS of books on knowing God's will.  I haven't read them all (but I've read a lot of Amazon reviews on them! &lt;grin&gt;), but THIS book is really helpful.  Rather than a giving a set prescription or magic formula to pray to find out God's will, Robert Jeffress takes us through Bible passages that tell us that God DOES care about us, even the little things. <br />The author talks about the different ways we can hear from God.  Feeling confused because you've been praying for God to speak to you?  How about looking around at your circumstances?  God works through those too!  <br />I can't begin to summarize this book.  You see, I'd checked it out from the public library, and over a period of weeks (yes, there were overdue fines - I should've just bought it!), I took voluminous notes on it.  I didn't want to miss a single important point, so I've got it all written down.  No doubt I'll be going back to those notes and again and again and eventually I'll buy my own copy of this book!<br />So read this book - it's informative, easy-follow, and enjoyable to read.

My children are in their late teens and early twenties and we still talk about these Alfie books!  I am so sad to see that &quot;Alfie Gives a Hand&quot; seems to be out of print.  If you can get a copy used here on Amazon, DO IT!<br />The illustrations are priceless - they depict REAL children and REAL life.  One of the reviewers here said that she felt it was too long a story for a 2 year old and I probably agree.  I think 3 to 6 year olds would understand the point more.<br />After all these years, I remember the story so well.  Alfie is invited to his first birthday party.  His mom gets him washed up and in clean clothes and off they go, with Annie Rose in her stroller.  Alfie is a little scared of this new experience (and don't you have little ones in your house who can identify?!) and he takes his blanket with him for comfort.<br />The birthday boy turns out to be rather ill-mannered (that happens sometimes too!) and one present gets thrown all over, and he blows bubbles into his jello (my kids got a big kick out of that!).  Then it comes time to play a game in a circle.  There is a little girl who is even more scared than Alfie and she doesn't want to play.  Alfie makes the courageous choice to put his precious blanket down hold this little girl's hand.  It works - she happily plays the game because of Alfie's kindness.  And Alfie discovers that it pays to help others, even if it means putting down your blanket for a time!<br />I highly recommend ALL the Alfie books!	2001-10-26

As my nest is emptying (our youngest went off to college this fall),  I look at those &quot;empty nest&quot; books with a combination of hesitancy, desire to know someone else's experience, and disbelief that I am really at this stage.  It seems we just brought our first baby girl home from the hospital (it was only 22 years ago, which often seems more like 22 months!).  <br />I'm thankful to the Lord for my children and for my dear husband - that after all these years, we still have things to talk about, experiences to share, and plenty of love left for each other.<br />So I opened this book, not real eagerly, I must confess - after all, this was about a book that I really wasn't ready for!  The 4-page introduction &quot;Feathers from My Nest&quot; alone is worth the price of this book!  Talk about telling it like it is!  Mr. Sparrow is talking to Mrs. Sparrow as she's trying to gather feathers from her nest - memories to take with her on their new journey together. <br />I have to thank Amazon for making it possible to get a better look inside the books we buy from them - the pages you will see are part of the first chapter of the book AFTER the intro I just mentioned.  You'll get an idea of Beth Moore's writing style.  <br />Each chapter talks about a certain &quot;feather&quot; that's been left behind in Beth's nest when her two daughters flew away.  One chapter is &quot;The Crumpled Kleenex&quot;.  Mom spends some time in her daughter's bed after the daughter leaves home and she finds this kleenex and she wonders what the tears were about.  &quot;The Binders&quot; talks about one of her daughter's method of proclaiming that she was making a new start with her schoolwork - this chapter has lessons for us all on the grace of God.  &quot;The Magazines&quot; chapter discusses the family's struggle with how our society values skinny women and how it impacted one of their daughters and their fight to pull her from the clutches of an eating disorder.  And &quot;The Green Cap and Gown&quot; is about graduation, of course.<br />The last chapter is entitled &quot;One Slightly Gray, Well-Seasoned Man&quot; and is about her husband Keith.  A perfect ending for this story of feathers left in their nest.  Beth is looking forward to the rest of her life with this wonderful man who was there at the beginning - before there were little chicks to leave feathers behind!<br />This book is a fabulous book for moms of all ages.  Don't think that it's just an &quot;Empty Nest&quot; book.  If you have children getting ready to try out their wings, this is a must-read.<br />I haven't read Beth Moore's other books (most notably &quot;Breaking Free&quot; and &quot;Praying God's Word&quot;), but I would like to.<br />If you have a child in high school or college, you simply must read this book.  My other very-favorite book on parenting older kids is &quot;Give Them Wings&quot; by Carol Kuykendall, which covers parenting from driver's license to leaving home.  Excellent book!<br />You might want to check out my reviews of other Christian books and music.	2001-10-26

Perhaps you have read Liz Curtis Higgs' books &quot;Bad Girls of the Bible&quot; and &quot;Really Bad Girls of the Bible&quot;.  Each book tells the story of those notorious women of the Bible whose stories exemplify God's grace.  In these books, Liz writes a contemporary short story dealing with these women.<br />In the preface of this book, she said that in thinking about what women to put in her two previous books, she realized that Mary Magdalene needed a book all to herself!  <br />The first half of the book is a fictional account about Mary Margaret Delaney, a contemporary &quot;type&quot; of Mary Magdalene.  This part of the book alone is reason enough to buy the book!  The writing is fabulous, and the story really draws you in.<br />But there is an excellent study that takes up the last half of the book.   You will enjoy joining Liz with your Bible open, to better understand this woman that we THINK we know all about, but really don't!  Liz quickly dispels any pre-conceived notions we have about Mary M's background.  I'll let you read it for yourself to find out the details!<br />Great food for thought!

This book is Hank Hanegraaff's answer to \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\" by Bruce Wilkinson.  It is not ONLY an answer to Jabez, it is also a great book on prayer.  But the small size and similar shape and quick readability of \\"The Prayer of Jesus\\" makes it perfect to hand someone who has swallowed the Jabez trend hook, line, and sinker.<br />Hank politely and appropriately points out the errors in Jabez, while not tearing down Jabez's author of the whole concept indiscriminately.  <br />But the focus in this book is on the prayer of JESUS taught us to pray!  I especially liked Chapter 8, titled \\"The Armor\\", which contains a fictional letter written from the enemy to one of his own, C.S. Lewis \\"Screwtape Letters\\" style.<br />While this book isn't the best I've read on the topic of prayer, it provides a much-needed balance to the Jabez movement (as of now, 24 weeks on the Bestseller List).  <br />This book is one that I will definitely re-read.  It would make a great gift - there's a lot of \\"meat\\" here in a small package.  You might already by aware of Hank's ministry as \\"Bible Answer Man,\\" a daily radio show.

I've already reviewed this book, but was led to write another review in light of the following...<br />Hank Hanegraff of the Christian Research Institute (he's the Bible Answer Man on Christian radio each day) has written a book that is his answer to Jabez - it's called &quot;The Prayer of Jesus&quot;.  I HIGHLY recommend this book!  Hank isn't attacking Bruce Wilkinson or the prayer of Jabez as it is in the Bible.  However, he does center on Jesus, which is what are prayers should be focused on.  It isn't the best book I've read on prayer, but it is an excellent response to Jabez and being a similar size and shape, it's a quick read.<br />The other thing that troubles me is the commercialization of this whole Jabez thing.  Here on Amazon, you can order a 2002 Jabez calendar, a Jabez &quot;sand mug&quot;, Jabez Cards (and what are those?!), and Jabez for ALL ages of children - including a board book for toddlers!<br />On another website, you can purchase 75 Jabez items including Jabez ties in 5 colors, Jabez shirts in all sizes, a Jabez travel mug, Jabez Bible Covers, Jabez lapel pins (in a package of 12), and a Jabez candle, just to name a few!!<br />If I had written a book on prayer that people were reading with great enthusiasm, the LAST thing I'd want would be the mass marketing of a variety of items  on that theme.  To me, it cheapens the message.<br />The book's author depicts this as a book that will change your life.  And from reading these reviews, it obviously has had a great deal of impact on a lot of people.  What bothered me about the book was his formulaic approach (pray this prayer every day, read the book once a week), and his comment that if you pray THIS prayer, God will answer it!  Like God doesn't answer all our prayers (albeit with yes, no, or wait)?!<br />If you're interested in my review of this book, or other Christian books, click on the &quot;About Me&quot; link above.<br />God bless you!	2001-09-13

This is a WONDERFUL book!  It's just beautiful and a real pleasure to look through.  I'm a beginning scrapbooker and I must admit that I'm more into journaling than scrapbooking (I'm not very artistic or creative and I'm better with words than with cutting and pasting!&lt;g&gt;).  <br />You really get to know the author through this book. This is not just a book of ideas for scrapbooking - it's really about the philosophy behind scrapbooking, and the reason for it.  The ideas are really good, and I learned a tremendous amount from this book.  But I think even more than that, I was inspired to venture out in my own writing on my scrapbook pages!	2001-09-09

It did hold my interest enough for me to finish it in a couple of days, but I guess I was expecting more.  <br />The author uses the technique of interspersing present-time segments (very brief - usually only a page or so) with longer sections that were being told to Julianna by Miriam's old boyfriend from her early years.  The sections each come out of an object taken out of a box of memories.  <br />I would've liked to have seen more development of the present-day character, Julianna.  The story would've been much more compelling if we knew more about her life, and how it was being influenced by what she was hearing about Miriam's life.  And I thought that the end was just a bit too predictable and a bit too tidy.<br />At the end of the book, there is the Prologue and the first chapter of the book that Mrs. Hatcher is writing which will be published during Summer 2002.<br />I love to read, and I read mostly non-fiction - I'm careful how I &quot;spend&quot; my reading minutes.  In Christian fiction, I'm looking for something a bit deeper than just a nice story.  I'm not saying that this book is shallow, but maybe I'm pickier than the typical Christian fiction reader.<br />You might be interested in my reviews of other Christian books and music!	2001-09-03

I think I need to read this book again!  What an amazing book written by a mom of three young daughters - and she still has her intellect together enough to be reading the heavier-weight Christian books!  These books mine the depths of the Christian faith.  Yes, they take extra effort, but I believe that if we make that effort, we will be rewarded by having a richer devotional life.<br />After I wrote my last review, the author wrote me an email, which was just great! I want to write her - and now I don't have her email!  So Ann, if you're reading this, please email me again (click on See More About Me for my email address)!  I have a couple questions for you about some of the books you were reading.<br />If you're a mom who wants a little more depth to your devotional life, this book is for YOU!!	2001-09-02

Smith's album of the same name, you should read this book!  I highly recommend this book for everyone, but especially for teens who face the difficult task of trying to grow up in today's mixed-up world.<br />The title of the book, &quot;This is Your Time&quot;, is also the title of a song he wrote after the Columbine tragedy.  Michael tells about his experience singing at the memorial service and talking to Cassie Bernall's parents (check out my review of Misty Bernall's book &quot;She Said Yes&quot;).  But this book isn't just about Columbine.  Michael talks about the death of Rich Mullins (which deeply affected me as well) and Rich's impact on people.  Michael also was a good friend of the late Bob Briner (author of Roaring Lambs) and he encourages Christians to get out there and make a difference.<br />He quotes Hebrews 12:1...<br />&quot;Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.&quot;<br />Amen!<br />(You might want to check out my other reviews of Christian books and music)	2001-08-09

I was surprised that this book has received 5 stars from everyone reviewing it so far.  I do agree that Mr. Hyatt does an excellent job in telling you exactly what to do in protecting your privacy.  <br />However, the time, money and energy spent on this is an enormous investment.  I can understand the wisdom of not giving out your social security number freely, but how many people are willing to do the following (these are things the author suggests):<br />Get a &quot;mail drop&quot; where your mail will be sent to - it's an actual physical address, not a PO Box.  Never accept mail addressed to you at your residence.<br />Don't say anything sensitive on the phone - these discussions should only be in person.<br />Don't have any credit cards, utilities, or ANYTHING with your real name and address.  You can create alternate addresses and alternate identities.<br />Pay for everything with cash or money orders.<br />Create a different &quot;identity&quot; - don't use your real name.  Create a credit history for this &quot;person&quot; and sign up for utilities in his/her name.  <br />If you have to sign for something, see if a friend or relative will sign it and have it in their name instead.  <br />Don't allow your computer to accept cookies and use Evidence Eliminator software so no one can see where you've been on the internet.  Disable Java and Active X.  <br />These are just a few examples.  I do believe that there are people who have had trouble with invasion of their privacy, but how far is the average American willing to go to protect their privacy?  Is this really necessary?  Wouldn't the focus of your life be on keeping your personal information very private?  <br />This book reminded me of what a spy would have to go through - or someone who really has something to hide.  Mr. Hyatt, to his credit, doesn't advocate breaking the law, but at times, I think he walks a fine line.  Legal, maybe? but is all this ethical? And you can bet that there are a lot of people writing similar books who encourage getting fake IDs, etc.  <br />The name Michael Hyatt might ring a bell in your mind.  Mr. Hyatt wrote &quot;The Millenium Bug&quot; and several other books about Y2K.  He became interested in &quot;self-reliant living&quot; and privacy issues through the research he did when writing the books about Y2K.  In hindsight, of course, the problems Mr. Hyatt forecasted never came to pass.  &quot;The Millenium Bug&quot; and similar books, helped fuel the panic and fear and paranoia that was such a part of our culture during 1998 and 1999.<br />So, you might want to take that into account when making these decisions for yourself and your family.	2001-07-19

What an upbeat and encouraging book that was!  This dear lady lost her husband to brain cancer when her son and daughter were still quite young.  I was amazed at how someone who has suffered such a loss can embrace life like she does and how she can really inspire others to look at life in a fresh new way.<br />This book is a collection of 101 short chapters, grouped by theme.  Each chapter starts with a brief Scripture passage and ends with a few questions to ponder.  Theses chapters are like potato chips - I dare you to read just one!  Even though it would be fun to just keep reading a whole bunch of these stories at one time, I encourage you to take the time and savor each chapter.  For there are profound things to think about in each one.<br />Sandra P. Aldrich (read the book to find out why she always includes her maiden name in her byline) is the type of woman that all younger women should have as a mentor.  Two few young moms these days have a godly older women to turn to for encouragement and getting that all-important perspective of being able to look back and say what REALLY matters as we're raising small children.<br />Sandra's book will make you laugh, and cry and will hopefully help you to look at life with a fresh enthusiasm and grateful spirit.  The author points us to Jesus Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith.<br />This book would make a WONDERFUL gift for women of all ages, but especially for young moms in the midst of raising their children.<br />Please check out my reviews of other Christian books and music!	2001-07-01

However, I read the reviews here on Amazon, thought it would be interesting, and found that The Immortal was a real page-turner - I finished it in two days and I did a lot of other things in those days!<br />I think my expectations for this book were raised by the reviews here on Amazon.  I enjoyed it, and it was rather fascinating at times, but I also felt that it took too long to get to the main point of the book.  It seemed to me that everything happens in the last 75 pages or so.  I also would've liked to have learned more about the organization that Claudia worked for.  This part seemed rather vague, but maybe there's a reason for that?<br />After it was over, I found myself wanting to know what happens next - I won't say what I wanted to know because I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, but suffice it to say that the book really leaves you hanging.<br />Overall, an enjoyable book with a unique and fascinating theme!...	2001-06-29

Cindy's mother was also a very fearful person and Cindy remembers her mother, unable to sleep, playing the piano and reading the Bible aloud in the middle of the night.<br />Cindy shares what she now sees as a compulsive, legalistic approach to reading the Bible.  She felt she never measured up and she read Scripture out of duty and fear rather than out of a hunger for the Lord.  Cindy lets you in on how she's worked towards resolving some of these issues, while admitting that she still struggles with these problems.<br />This book is not one of those &quot;I had this problem, but now I learned this, and the problem is gone!&quot;.  Cindy tells of a much more realistic situation and gives everyone who struggles with any of these issues a hope for a better tomorrow through Jesus Christ our Lord!<br />I admire Cindy for her honesty and candor.  I also really enjoyed her writing style - her description of growing up in the eastern Tennessee mountains really helps the reader feel like they're there.  I really enjoyed reading about her grandfather too.<br />Cindy Morgan is married to Sigmund Brouwer, who is the author of many Christian books (many are written for young boys - see coolreading.com).  Cindy and Sigmund have a new baby girl named Olivia - God bless you, Cindy, Sigmund and Olivia!<br />Please check out my reviews of Christian books and music!	2001-06-29

This book is amazing!  Every Christian woman who wants a more vibrant prayer life and a healthier body should read this book!  <br />The first thing that impressed me when I started reading PrayerWalk was that the author was very honest and made herself very vulnerable in telling about how she was feeling about herself and about life before she started prayerwalking.  That really helped me to identify with her.  She wasn't one of those women who have their act together in every area of their lives.  <br />And for those of you who think that the weather in your area isn't conducive to walking outside, you can read about the weather conditions in Janet's northern California mountain valley community. The temperatures there are below freezing from September through April!  <br />For those of you who don't think you have time to prayerwalk, consider that the author has a full-time job as a high-school English teacher as well as her responsibilities of being wife and mother.  Janet walks at 5am every weekday, and it's usually dark.<br />She's had some interesting encounters - from a mountain lion to drug dealers.  Janet had planned on praying for her own spiritual growth and for her family members and friends.  As she walked, she expanded her prayer list to include many others in the town in which she lives - she prays for businesses she walks by, government buildings and what goes on inside, and so much more.  I found this both humbling and exciting to see how God can lead you when you embark on this new endeavor of prayerwalking!  <br />I read this book in 24 hours.  After I read the first 70 pages or so, I put the book down, grabbed my jacket and went for a 30 minute PrayerWalk!  Using the author's formula, I figured that my target heart rate is between 85 and 129.  I enjoy contemporary Christian music, so I took my DiscMan along and the words of the music helped me form my prayers.  Does anyone else do this?<br />Please check out my reviews of other Christian books and music!	2001-06-06

But if it works, that's great! <br />I think the idea of having the seeker read the Scripture passages himself is a good one.  Although I certainly wouldn't even think of putting a limit on what God can do through the reading of His Word, I wonder what a person would think about the Bible passages if they put no stock in the Bible as the Word of God.  There are people who won't be convinced by what the Bible says about itself, and those people might possibly be persuaded by outside sources such as the writings of Josephus and the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br />Mr. Fay does a good job of telling you what people's objections to the Christian faith might be and how to answer them.  He clearly outlines the Scriptures that you should share with those you're sharing your faith with.  The appendices are very helpful and William Fay's testimony is fascinating, to say the least....	2001-06-06

The best thing you can give your child is the love of reading.  Being a good reader will not only help your child in school, but your child will have a lifetime's worth of learning nad pleasure ahead of him!  <br />My own children are in their late teens and early 20's and I was fortunate enough to hear Jim Trelease speak at a public library many years ago, probably soon after the first edition of The Read Aloud Handbook came out.  We started reading to our oldest child when she was 4 months old and as the others came along, they were read to from birth since we were reading to the older one(s).  <br />This book is incredibly inspiring - Jim gives so many great suggestions on what books to read to your kids, and how to interest kids who may be reluctant to enter into reading themselves.<br />Just the list of books alone would be worth the price of this book!  I know that we wouldn't have known about some of the books we read to our kids without Jim's book.<br />Jim Trelease also covers the issue of TELEVISION in his book.  He gives very convincing reasons for turning OFF the TV and reading instead.  I had already made the decision for our family that we weren't going to allow the children to watch endless hours of TV (even though all they watched was Sesame Street and Mister Rogers!), but Jim's book confirmed my decision.<br />My kids all enjoy reading - and my husband and I have always been readers.  For me, the book was just confirming what I already knew - and it gave me so many good titles to find at the library!  I remember reading &quot;Stone Fox&quot; to our girls and what a great experience that book was. <br />Public libraries are a wonderful resource, but they don't take the place of having a child OWN some books of his own.  Tell family members to buy your children books for Christmas and birthday gifts.  When you can, buy hardcover as they will last a lot longer.  Look up some of the books Trelease recommends here on Amazon - you can read reviews and make some good choices. <br />Children today are TOO BUSY - most kids have more activities than anyone could possibly handle and still have time to stop and just be!  10-15 years ago, kids would play a sport, or play an instrument, take dance lessons, or be in Scouts.  They might do two of these things.  But I know kids who do them ALL, plus more things I haven't mentioned.  And one of the things that gets cut out with all the busy-ness is READING.  Meals together as a family fall by the wayside and kids and parents are so exhausted from running around with all the activities that they don't read books and the parents are too tired to read to them.  <br />If you have young children, please consider fighting this pressure to sign your child up for every available activity.  Take time to enjoy your family - the kids grow up much too fast!<br />And give your kids the gift of reading - buy a copy of this marvelous book, consult it often, and you'll enjoy a richness of family life that your kids will remember forever!	2001-05-10

I read very little fiction, and I haven't read any of Terri Blackstock's other books, but I picked up this book because it's short and it looked interesting.<br />The mom in the story, Maggie, is dying of ovarian cancer.  For the years prior to this, her daughters Corinne and Sarah have been busy with their own lives.  Indeed, they haven't seen their mother in at least a year when Maggie convinces them to come join her at an ocean-side cottage for a week's vacation.  <br />I felt that the daughters' characters seemed somewhat extreme and exaggerated, but perhaps people today really ARE so consumed with their own lives that they don't notice things (like their mother is so thin, her hair is very short).  At the beginning of the story, they are extremely selfish and act like a couple of spoiled children.  It's not until Maggie reveals her serious medical condition that the sisters try to get along and give their mom some of their time and emotional energy.  When the truth comes out, the daughters swing totally the other way, wanting to do anything to help, etc.<br />This book is a quick read - about two hours.  It's a good reminder that we should all make an effort with our family members while we still can.	2001-05-10

Subtitled &quot;How to love the world without falling for it&quot;, Dick Staub's book really makes you think.  The author says that if we are truly following Jesus, we will seem too Christian to pagans, and too pagan for our fellow Christians.<br />The author is correct in saying that if we stay in our safe and secure Christian bubble, we won't have much influence on the world.  We must be aware of what secular culture is like out there.  And while Dick says that we must be discerning, I think there are some problems with becoming as involved in the world's culture as Dick suggests.<br />He encourages Christians to meet people where they are - go to those parties which you would rather not attend, read the secular bestselling books so you can talk to people about them, see the movies everyone is seeing, listen to the popular secular music so you can identify with what people are listening to.<br />While I see the advantages of being aware of popular culture, I do think there are problems with Christians immersing themselves in secular culture.  I think there's a fine line that we need to walk as Christians impacting the world, but not getting dragged down by it.<br />Dick Staub is the Founder and Chairman of &quot;The Center for Faith and Culture&quot;.  So researching secular culture is his main job.  Most of us would not have the time or energy to take part in all this, let alone WANT TO.  There are many Christians who have come out of a background where music with explicit lyrics and movies depicting sex and violence were part of their lives.  I don't believe it would be a good idea of these people to start taking part in these things again.<br />Most of us have very limited time what with careers, families, etc.  Our own walk with God (reading the Scriptures, praying, reading other Christian books, meeting with other Christians) mustn't be neglected.  I do think there are ways of being aware of popular culture without taking it all in ourselves.  There are many websites that review movies from a Christian perspective and you can find out what a movie is about that way.  I'm not saying this is the same as seeing a movie, but I don't think that's a feasible thing for most people to do, for various reasons.<br />I do think we can share our faith and bring into our stories samples of how a secular worldview doesn't work without immersing ourselves in such things.  We can know what Marilyn Manson and Eminem are singing about without purchasing their music!  If we spend out time reading all the bestselling books, will there be time left for books that draw us closer to God?<br />I'm sorry to be a downer when the other reviews are so positive -but I think this is a side that needs considering. Perhaps you've heard the story about how FBI agents learn to discern counterfeit money - they study the REAL THING, not the counterfeit!  I think we should concentrate on the REAL THING - JESUS, and remember:<br />The Holy Bible, New International Version Philippians 4:8 (NIV) 8Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things.many websites that review movies from a Christian perspective and you can find out what a movie is about that way.

Packer's landmark book &quot;Knowing God&quot; for years, but I haven't read it yet!  However, I was able to pick this book up and finish it in just a couple of hours (with some extra time for reflection on some of Dr. Packer's wise comments).<br />The author compiling this work, Wendy Murray Zoba, tells us in the introduction that Packer is a personal friend of hers.  He has been a guest in their home many times.  On one occasion, Wendy's teenaged son had some friends over and they wanted to ask Dr. Packer some of those hard questions.  Wendy taped the resulting conversation, and this book lets us in on this great theologian explaining the Christian faith to these high school boys.<br />The questions concern a wide variety of subjects - materialism in today's society, what entertainment should we take in as Christians, how should a new Christian read the Bible (see below for the answer!), denominations, and why should Christians go to church are a few.<br />The answers to the questions range from a paragraph or two to a page or two.  You can pick up the book, read a question (or two, or three, kind of like potato chips - you can't read just one!) and come back to it later for some more.  Even though Packer explains his points very well for the layperson, you might want to &quot;chew&quot; on some of his points before you continue reading.<br />My favorite answer was to the question about how we can develop a pattern for Bible reading.  Dr. Packer has 4 main points here: 1) Quiet yourself in God's presence.  Ask God to speak to you through His Word. 2)All of the Bible should be read and read regularly.  If you read 4 chapters a day, you can finish the Bible in a year.  (Please see my &quot;about me&quot; section to read reviews of Bibles, including the One Year Bible, and my Listmania List of favorite Bibles).  I read through the whole Bible in 1997 and read MOST of it again last year using the One Year Bible. 3) Having said that all Scripture is important, Dr. Packer says we should also concentrate on the sections of the Bible that are more &quot;vitamin rich&quot;.  These books are the 4 Gospels, and the book of Psalms. 4) Dig deeper into a particular book of the Bible that especially speaks to you.  Martin Luther loved Romans, and Dr. Packer's favorite is Ecclesiastes.  As for me, I like Romans chapter 8 and the book of John.<br />After all the questions and answers, Wendy Zoba includes a 30-page biography of Packer that tells about his childhood run-in with a truck (he has a dented head!) and then goes on to talk about his Christian faith and the history of how he was involved with the evangelical movement within the Church of England.  <br />I plan on tackling one of Packer's books in the near future!  <br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music!

Perhaps this book is aimed more at the gourmet cook with LOTS of space for storing all kinds of gadgets and tools!  But I have been cooking from scratch for almost 25 years now, and I have not found a need for many of the tools this book claims are basic and necessary.  <br />I did enjoy, however, looking through this book with its beautiful pictures.  I also enjoyed learning about tools that I have never seen before!  There are no doubt people who use tools such as the tomato press, nutmeg mill, bean slicer, and cheese dome, frequently and couldn't cook without them!  Which gadgets a cook treasures is a very individual thing.  <br />As for me, my favorite cooking gadgets are Kitchen Aid mixer (see my review of this on Amazon), garlic press, and a rotary grater for grating fresh parmesan cheese.  My advice is to check out reviews of particular brands of cooking tools here on Amazon and on other cooking websites.<br />This book has many fold-out pages with pictures of MARVELOUS looking food!  There are quite a few recipes and many have photos showing the various steps.  Most of the recipes are on the gourmet-cooking end of the scale, rather than ones that would be easy to make and family-friendly. <br />My advice is to decide which tools you will need for YOUR style of cooking and then buy a quality product that will serve you well and will last a long time!<br />Please check out my other reviews - I've reviewed a number of cookbooks here on Amazon.  Happy cooking!	2001-05-01

It's fascinating that this small Christian book has been at the top of the bestseller lists.  A few people I know have raved about this book, but I had to read it myself, of course.<br />I have the same reservations about this book that some of the other reviewers have.  All of a sudden, Bruce Wilkinson finds this prayer in one of the more obscure books of the Old Testament (not that I have anything against 1 Chronicles, or any book of the Bible - I've read them all), and he says that our lives will be changed if we pray this prayer every day for 30 days AND re-read the book once a week.  Hmmm...<br />I have written out the prayer and I'm going to incorporate it into my devotional time, and I know that the Bible says that we're to pray with expectancy, but I guess I'm just not convinced.  I'm praying about THAT, too!<br />I just looked at the website  I suggest you go there and have a look around.  You can read testimonies of people who say their lives have been changed by this prayer.  Perhaps God IS using this book to bring His people closer to Himself?  Praying about &quot;enlarging one's borders&quot; is great - we all need to pray outside our comfort zone.<br />I suggest you take a look at the book's website - and buy this book on Amazon and read it for yourself.  I'm going to watch the reviews on this one!<br />If you're interested in being used by the Lord, and &quot;enlarging your borders&quot;, check out my review of John Ortberg's book &quot;If You Want to Walk On Water, You Have to Get Out of the Boat&quot;.	2001-04-22

It's small size makes it easy to put it in a briefcase, backpack, or purse.  There are two readings for each day - morning and evening.  This book was compiled by Samuel Bagster and first published in 1794.  <br />Anne Graham Lotz introduces this wonderful book to a new generation of Christians.  In the preface, she explains that her mother (Ruth Bell Graham) received a copy of this book from her mother at age 10 and has read it every single day of her life.  Anne received it from her mother at age 10, and she has likewise given the book to her children.  <br />Each devotion is complete on one page and is totally Scripture.  There is a theme, and then the verses all center around that theme.  All the references are at the bottom of the page so you can look up the verses if you choose.<br />This soft leather book has gold-edged pages, and a ribbon marker to keep your place.<br />Daily Light makes a great gift!<br />Please see my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2001-04-17

This is a small book - just 92 pages, but it has lots and lots of great ideas that you can use to enrich your devotional times with the Lord.  Here are some of my favorites taken from this book of 30 ideas:<br />Personalize Scripture - put your own name in it, or the name of someone in your family.<br />Pass on the legacy - give a child (probably an older child) a gift of a Bible, but before you give it to them, highlight your favorite passages, write in the margins the significance of these passages in your lives.  You can also give them suggestions on studies and activities to enrich their reading of this Bible (one example was to give each Psalm a descriptive title!)<br />Make Quiet Time baskets - put small devotional books, journals, pens, Bibles in groups in different locations in your house.  Having something to read in the car when you have those unexpected waits is an especially good suggestion.<br />Mark &quot;The Roman Road&quot; (yes, Pam gives you the verses, or you find them online if you search for &quot;Roman Road&quot;) in your Bible.  That way if someone asks you about your faith, you've got that right there to show them, if the situation calls for that!<br />Got a favorite hymn, praise song or contemporary Christian song?  What scriptures is it based on?  Do a study of those scriptures.  The song will mean more to you than ever before.<br />Keep a list of questions that you'd like to ask God when you get to heaven!<br />Keep a list of questions that seekers might ask (and write down the answers too!).  You can find lots of great books on Amazon to help you study up on this subject!<br />Use colored pencils and/or pens to mark your Bible.  Kay Arthur teaches a great Bible study method in which she teaches how to make symbols for certain themes found in the Bible.<br />Keep a journal!  And if you're interested in finding more about keeping a journal, see my review of &quot;How to Keep a Spiritual Journal&quot; by Ron Klug!<br />Enjoy your re-chargedquiet times!	2001-04-11

I've known some things about Corrie Ten Boom's story for years.  I've even shared with other people the story about getting the ticket before you get on the train (and not before - in other words, we don't get ready for things way beforehand - God will give us the strength to deal with what we need to exactly when we need it).  Then I watched the movie - but I hadn't read the book.  Til now!<br />When I read, I use those Post-It arrows to mark favorite passages in books I'm reading.  This book has tons of markers sticking out of this book!  This story of Corrie and her family during World War II has impacted me greatly.  I've been talking about this book to anyone who will listen!  <br />Here are some of my favorite life lessons from The Hiding Place:<br />Some knowledge is &quot;too heavy&quot; for us to carry.  When Corrie was a child, she and her father were on a train ride.  She asked a question that had an adult theme, and Corrie's father then asked her to carry his heavy suitcase.  When Corrie tried and said it was too heavy, her father said that some knowledge is too heavy for children and that he would carry it for Corrie until she was older and ready to hear it.  In the same way, God carries our &quot;too heavy&quot; burdens. <br />Happiness isn't something that depends on our surroundings, but it's something we make inside ourselves.  This is one of Corrie's sister Betsie's statements.  Betsie was a real example to Corrie - she always prayed for her enemies and put the best construction on things.  Betsie died in the concentration camp at Ravensbruck.<br />Betsie said, &quot;There are no &quot;ifs&quot; in God's world.  And no places that are safer than other places.  The center of His will is our only safety.  Oh, Corrie, let us pray that we will always know it.&quot;<br />The bottle of vitamins which did not run out until there was a fresh supply is an amazing story of God's provision.  Compare this situation to 1 Kings 17:7-24 when Elijah was staying with the widow of Zarephath.  She had a small amount of flour and oil, but the supplies did not run out.  After Corrie received a new source of vitamins, the bottle which had supplied sustaining drops for so long was suddenly totally empty!<br />When in prison in Holland, Corrie had received 4 gospels, but not a whole Bible.  She read these and then later she passed them out page by page.  How we take our Bibles for granted!  Later, her sister Nollie sent her a complete Bible and Corrie didn't know how she could get it into the concentration camp when they were transported to Germany.  As it turned out, all the other women were &quot;patted down&quot; and searched, but no one touched Corrie (she was hiding her Bible under her dress) and no one even seemed to see her!<br />When Corrie and Betsie read the Bible in the concentration camp in Ravensbruck, people gathered around.  The words would be translated into many languages and they could hear so many women hearing the Gospel in their own language.  Quoting from the book, &quot;The blacker the night around us grew, the brighter and truer and more beautiful burned the Word of God.&quot;<br />Corrie and Betsie gave thanks to God for the lice that infested their barracks because the guards stayed away from that area.  This enabled the sisters to conduct Bible Studies without being found out!<br />I hope that these examples have piqued your interest in this marvelous book!  Be sure to see the movie too, but be sure to read the book!<br />Please see my reviews of other Christian books!	2001-04-08

This Bible is New Testament only, which is it's only drawback.  On a two-page spread, the reader can study a Bible passage in 8 different translations!  Everything from the King James Version to The Message is included!  My favorite translations are NIV and New Living Translation (NLT), but I enjoy reading the others as well.  When a passage is hard to understand, reading all the translations can be extremely helpful.  Having The Message side-by-side with the others is a great feature of this Bible!<br />One complaint I have is with the quality of the book itself.  When you open the book, you can run your finger down the middle where the pages are bound together and it makes a crinkling sound.  It's rather bumpy there where the pages come together and while it doesn't affect the quality of the text, it can be slightly annoying if you love books for their feel in your hands and the quality of the materials used, as well as for the content of the book!<br />I highly recommend this book - it sure beats having 8 different Bibles open around you while you're studying!  Having this one leaves you more room for your Concordance, Bible Dictionary, and Commentaries!<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and my Listmania List of &quot;Great Bibles&quot;.	2001-04-01

People who really love to cook and really love gadgets and cookware will enjoy this book.  There is lots of interesting reading here.  I had never heard of MANY of the items listed here, but then I'm not really a gourmet cook.  I just like to own products that are the best quality I can get for the money I want to spend.<br />There are no prices in the book, which I think is a drawback.  Even if they become quickly outdated, it would be good to see which products are more expensive than others.  Price categories would be helpful!  Even &quot;Expensive&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot; and &quot;Inexpensive&quot; would be a good addition to this book!<br />The other thing I'd like to see is a ranking of these products!  They are all described and discussed, but there's no way of knowing which ones are the best.  Consumers can make decisions for themselves as to which products are best for them for the money they want to spend.<br />This is an interesting book, but it could've been better.	2001-04-01

This slim hardcover book, is a feast for the eyes, as well as the mind.  Each of the eight chapters is beautifully illustrated with a variety of pictures depicting mankind's love affair with books over history.  Each chapter has a few pages by the author, but then he includes a LOT of quotes from various thinkers on reading and libraries from centuries past. One of the quotes is used on Amazon bookmarks: &quot;When I get a little money, I buy books; and if there is any left I buy food and clothes.&quot; by Erasmus.<br />Two of the chapters I especially enjoyed are &quot;A Place to Read&quot; and &quot;The Lure of Libraries&quot;.  At the end of the book, a few lined but blank pages are included for &quot;My Personal Book List&quot; where the reader can jot down titles of books that have been recommended.<br />I noticed that Terry Glaspey is coming out with another book about reading and books this coming June.  I'm looking forward to checking that one out!<br />Please see my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2001-03-31

This is the perfect book to read if you've wanted to try online shopping, but need more information first.<br />Jill's style is entertaining and the book is quick-moving.  You won't realize how much information you've accumulated while enjoying reading about the ins and outs of shopping online!  <br />I highly recommend this book for newbies to shopping online.  Jill explains everything clearly step-by-step.  She also includes how to shop at Ebay and other online auctions.  Most newbies would prefer to start their online shopping experience with something a bit easier, like buying this book at Amazon, for example, but everything you need to jump into the Ebay auction world is there if you decide to do that!<br />The book discusses how to look at the &quot;big ticket items&quot; online as well - things like houses and cars and colleges!  You can do research online even if you end up buying the product at the local mall.  <br />Jill Freeze is visually impaired and she is a perfect example of how online shopping makes life easier for SO many people in SO many different situations.  I have been shopping online for a few years now, and have bought stuff from lots of e-tailers, including Amazon (yes, it was the first, and my favorite!), Webvan, Ebay, Half.com, Lands End, Drugstore.com, and many others.  There's very little that you can't buy online, actually!<br />Jill discusses how to research the item you're looking to buy - she gives you lots of websites to check, but I found that she left out a few of my favorites:<br />BizRate.com - gives detailed reports on the different online stores - comparing on-time delivery, easy navigation of the website, prices, quality of items sold, etc.  Yes, Amazon is very highly rated on Bizrate.com!<br />DealOfDay.com - looking for a deal?  Check out what special offers are available at the online store of your choice ($10 off a $50 purchase, for example!)<br />BestBookBuys.com - My favorite thing to shop for online (and off-line, for that matter!) is books, and this website is the best for finding which store has your book at what price.  You type in the title, author, or ISBN number, and it looks at about 30 different bookstores online and comes up with an easy-to-understand chart giving you the price (lowest price first), shipping cost, tax in what states, and best of all - AVAILABILITY of your book!  Many shopping bots leave out this important fact.  You can see the bottom line price - including shipping, and how soon your book will get to you.  If you find that Amazon is your best bet for your latest must-have book (and it often is, all things considered), just click on &quot;Buy&quot; and BestBookBuys.com will take you right to the book detail page on Amazon (or whatever other e-tailer you click on) and there you are!  Before buying from a bookstore that you aren't familiar with, check it out at Bizrate first.  <br />Thanks, Jill, for a complete guide to the wonderful world of shopping online!	2001-03-22

I was immediately attracted to this book because I've read &quot;Friendships of Women&quot; by Dee Brestin and I've been a fan of Kathy Troccoli's music for about 10 years now.  <br />Kathy is single, and Dee has been married a long time, and the way they weave their stories together in this book just great!  This book was an easy read and it moved very quickly (women with little time to read, have no fear!).  <br />Perhaps the thing that struck me most was how vulnerable Kathy was in relating her journal entries, many of which were addressed to the husband she has longed for.  Even though she's prayed for a husband, she has really ministered powerfully to other single women and is a great example of making the most with whatever twists and turns life happens to take.<br />Dee and Kathy used the titles of love songs as chapter and sub-chapter titles.  I don't think that enhanced the book at all, at least not for me.  Some people might really enjoy those, though.<br />The book contains a lot of detailed information about the relationships between Mary and Martha and Jesus and between Ruth and Naomi and how we can learn from those stories how to have a more complete love relationship with our Savior Jesus Christ....	2001-03-21
US	53015346	R3CHNQYSD5SZGY	084233484X	105032947	Essential Guide to Bible Versions	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Very informative!	Although I'm a layperson who studies the Bible for my own personal faith and leading a Bible Study, I really enjoyed this book.  I think that pastors and serious Bible students would probably get more out of it, but learned a lot from Dr. Comfort's discussion!<br />Dr. Comfort discusses how the Old Testament and New Testament were canonized, the impact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and this history of Bible translation.  I was especially interested in John Wycliffe's story and how he objected to many aspects of the Catholic church 150 years before Martin Luther's &quot;95 Theses&quot;!  Wycliffe is often called &quot;The Morning Star of the Reformation&quot; and of course Wycliffe Bible Translators was named after this man who was the first to translate God's Word into English.<br />Tyndale lived about the same time as Luther and was killed because of his translation of the New Testament.  He kept getting the Bible out to people in England, and the Catholic Church kept confiscating and burning them.  Tyndale's dying prayer was &quot;Lord, open the King of England's eyes!&quot;<br />A student of Tyndale, Miles Coverdale completed the work that Tyndale started.  He finished the translation of the Bible.  About that time, King Henry VIII had broken ties with the Pope and was ready for an English translation of the Bible.  Tyndale's prayer had been answered!<br />Dr. Comfort's book gives a detailed account of how each Bible version came into being, and whether the versions are word-for-word (KJV, NKJV, RSV), thought-for-thought (NIV) functionally equivalent (CEV, NLT) or a paraphrase (The Living Bible and The Message).<br />He recommends that today's Bible readers should use more than one translation to get a complete overview.  Personally, I use NIV mostly, but I also really like New Living Translation.  And reading The Message gives a fresh approach and is really good for pleasure reading.<br />I highly recommend &quot;The Contemporary Parallel New Testament&quot; edited by John R. Kohlenberger.  This wonderful book has 8 Bible versions side-by-side (all 8 versions of a passage on a two-page spread).  <br />Please see my other reviews for many reviews of different Bibles and check out my Listmania List &quot;Great Bibles&quot; for info on some of my favorites!<br />God bless you in your study of the Word of God!	2001-03-13

This wonderful book contains many helpful and very practical ideas about how you can connect with God in the midst of busy motherhood.  The author knows how it is - she has 3 small daughters.  <br />Included in the book are comments from a number of moms in different situations and having children of different ages - these women commented on the topics in each chapter and their suggestions were great too.  You won't find perfect, saintly women with perfect lives - but you will find workable solutions for finding quiet time in your busy life.<br />The author discusses journaling and tells about how that has helped her spiritually.  She also gives ideas of where to get journals, different types of journaling, etc.  (For more on journaling, see the &quot;about me&quot; section above and look for my review of &quot;How to Keep a Spiritual Journal&quot; by Ronald Klug.<br />At the end of the book, Ann lists MANY books she recommends on all the subjects the book touches on.  This bibliography alone would be worth the price of the book!<br />My only complaint?  It would be great to have the author's email address in the book so grateful readers like me can give her feedback!	2001-03-11

She has many ideas which will give you ideas of your own.<br />She includes many scriptures to look up and use in your own prayers for your children.  Her chapter on waiting was especially good, I thought!<br />There is a chapter on praying for prodigals and another about praying for grandchildren, so if you are a mom, this book is for you!<br />Thanks Cheri, for another great book on prayer.<br />My only suggestion would be for the author to include her email address so those of us who would like email her to tell her how much we enjoyed her book could do so!	2001-03-11

Peter is called by Jesus, he walks on the water, but then he sees the wind and cries out with fear.  He starts to sink, but Jesus takes Peter's hand and they get into the boar.  It is then that the wind dies down.<br />The author doesn't tell us to just jump out of the boat - he gives helpful advice on discerning God's call on our lives, focusing on Jesus (without which our water-walking days won't last!) and being patient as we try to accomplish things for the glory of God.<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2001-02-23

The stories are personal about something you'll be able to relate to.<br />After each chapter, Pam put in &quot;Power Perks: A Sip of Hope and Humor&quot;, which include a humorous story and short thought-provoking quotes from a wide range of writers.<br />Are you reading this book with your small group, or discussing it with a friend?  Turn to the &quot;Koffee Klatch Questions&quot; at the end of the book for a few questions for discussion for each chapter.  <br />I'm rather particular about a book's appearance and feel, and the paper color, fonts, etc.  This book has a smooth colorful cover (no dust-jacket to get crumpled) and the use of a different font for chapter headings was great.  There is a motif of a coffee cup and book that continues throughout the book.  This may be a small matter, but it really does make the book more appealing.<br />This is an IDEAL gift to give a friend who could use some encouragement, but doesn't have time for long chapters.<br />I buy books for our church library and just purchased a copy of this one!<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2001-02-14

We saw a live play on Roanoke Island called &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;.  This play has been running for 60 years in the same location!  It was fascinating to learn about these colonists from England who came over before the other colonists that we're traditionally more informed about - the settling of Jamestown in Virginia in 1607, then Maryland in 1632 and Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1620 and 1630.<br />Angela Hunt's book contains characters that were real people in history - Governor John White, Ananias Dare and his wife Eleanor, and Virginia Dare, John's grand-daughter who was the first English baby born on American soil, in August of 1587.  After his grandchild is born, John White returns to England to get more food, supplies and more colonists.  Because of England's war with Spain, Queen Elizabeth doesn't allow him to return!  A few years later, he finally gets there and doesn't find his colony!  <br />This novel portrays what might have happened - how these people lived and loved and worshiped and dealt with Indians and with each other.  Jocelyn, the main character and Eleanor Dare's cousin, is married to Thomas, the pastor of the colony.  Her loving patience with a husband who feels that it is sinful to love his wife is truly inspiring.  The book takes place over about 20 years.  <br />This series is continued with 3 children who escape Indian attack and escape to what will be Jamestown.  The next book is entitled Jamestown.<br />If you are at all interested in history (or even if you're not!), this is a marvelous book, mixture of fiction and fact, and speculation of whatever happened to The Lost Colony.<br />I'm starting the next book in the series - I hope the next one is as good as this one!<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music.<br />God bless you!	2001-02-11

This is one of my Top 10 Christian books -...!<br />I lead a small group Bible Study in my home and we're studying the book of John.  Time and again, I would open this book by Joanna Weaver and read to my group out of it.  Finally, they all decided they needed a copy of their own!  And some of them are in turn passing it on to other friends and relatives.<br />The author makes herself vulnerable in this book, passing along personal anectdotes and stories we can all identify with.  This book shows you how to sit at Jesus feet like Mary while still getting stuff done like Martha.  <P... of course I had to get this book for our library after I had read it.....<br />Please read it - you'll love it too!<br />...!<br />May God bless you and your family!	2001-02-02

This classic book, released the same year as Oswald Chambers' &quot;My Utmost for His Highest&quot;, has been edited by James Reimann.  It maintains the original beauty of the language and ideas while making it more reader-friendly for the readers of today.<br />Mrs. Cowman used many sources to come up with her the readings in this wonderful book.  There is a list in the back of all the people whose works she had read in compiling this devotional.  <br />In my opinion, one of the most useful features of Streams is that it has a Scripture Index.  If you are studying a certain book of the Bible or specific passage, you can find out which days' devotions contain discussion of that particular Scripture.  I lead a small group Bible Study in my home and I use Streams almost every week to gather information on the chapter we are studying. Streams in the Desert also has an Index by Contributor and a Subject Index.  <br />I have given this book as a gift several times to people going through difficult times.  People tell me that God really used this book to speak to them during their time of need.  This devotional isn't just for people going through difficult trials -it is an excellent daily devotional on it's own.<br />Whether you use this book in your daily devotions, or for researching specific passages or topics, this is a must-have for any Christian's library!  The CD project by the same name is an excellent album also.<br />I have wanted to write a review of this book for a long time, but have hesitated because I knew that I could not do it justice.  Please order this book ... ... now and be blessed!<br />You might want to check out my other reviews of Christian books and music.  God bless you!	2001-02-02

I really enjoyed this book.  It isn't real long and it's not too heavy for the lay-person.  Part I of the book consists of 10 chapters on such topics as Praying the Psalms, The Lord's Prayer, and Biblical Meditation.  There is an excellent chapter on unanswered prayer, which is an important issue to address.<br />The real goldmine in this book, however, is Part II, which consists of nine lists of specific scriptures to use in your prayers.  There is a list of Psalms by mood, scripture passages on thanksgiving and praise, Bible promises, and also a Harmony of the Gospels type list that helps you meditate on the Gospels.<br />This is an excellent resource on prayer for your personal library or your church library.<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music.	2001-02-02

I've been journaling on and off for years, more on than off for the last few years!  Ronald Klug does an outstanding job of explaining the importance of keeping a journal, ideas to get you going, suggestions of things to write about, etc.<br />Keeping a journal has been one of the most satisfying and helpful things I've done in my Christian walk.  When you go back to read it later, you can really see God's working in your life!<br />One of the things that Klug addresses that I've never seen anywhere else is the &quot;problem&quot; of what do to with notes you might be taking on books you're currently reading.  Do you incorporate them into your daily journal, or keep a separate notebook?  I'm journaling every day and reading my Bible and other books every day, and this is something that I've done different ways and I haven't found any one solution to be entirely satisfactory.  I thought it was wonderful that the author even addressed the &quot;problem&quot;!  I want to be able to find notes on a particular book I'm reading easily, and if they're scattered throughout the dailyness of your writing, that is harder to do.<br />He suggests keeping notes from other books you are reading in a separate notebook from your daily journal.  And he suggests indexing them so you know what's in that notebook!  An excellent suggestion and one I hadn't tried before.  Just leave the first page blank and you could write which books' notes are contained in the book, and you could even add page numbers.  I think this is a great idea!<br />As for brief quotes that you might be struck by, or particular scripture passages that you're learning about, you could include those in your daily journal.  <br />The author says that he writes in spiral notebooks of lined paper.  When he's finished, he puts them in a binder so that he has them all in order.  While I prefer the small hardcover spiral-bound books that you find in Christian bookstores for journaling purposes, having them all together andin order is an attractive option!  I also prefer using colorful Gelly Roll pens that are archival safe and permanent.<br />However you do it, Ronald Klug emphasizes that however you keep your journal is right for you.  Whether you write it or dictate it or type it, whether you write in it twice a day, twice a week, or twice a year - it's a valuable tool for spiritual growth.<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books!<br />Happy journaling!	2001-01-10

What a treasure we have in Francine Rivers' books!  I had never really appreciated Tamar's story before.  The Bible gives her story only one chapter - Genesis 38.  The book has the background about Judah and how he still felt guilty all those years for selling Joseph into slavery.  It is very interesting how the well-known story of Joseph and his brothers (taken the Broadway in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;) is so closely related to this much-less known story of Tamar and allegiance to the family of Judah.  <br />The book opens with Judah choosing Tamar as a wife for his oldest son Er.  After the first two sons (and Tamar's first two husbands!) meet with bad ends, Judah is understandably reluctant to honor his last son by giving him to Tamar, lest the deaths of his other sons had something to do with her.  Judah sends Tamar back to her family, in disgrace.<br />Through determination and cleverness, Tamar makes sure that Judah's line continues through her.  She conceives and gives birth to twin sons Perez and Zerah.<br />Unveiled is the first in a new Francine Rivers series called &quot;The Lineage of Grace&quot; - each is about a woman who is an ancestor of Jesus Christ.  <br />This book was easy to read, yet very thought-provoking - lots to chew on here!  And I found the Study Guide at the back of the book to be ENORMOUSLY helpful!  The scriptures quoted were outstanding and the questions and comments really make you think.  I got much more out of the book since I also took some time with the Study Guide.  <br />I highly recommend this book - it's wonderful to find such an enjoyable, yet thought-provoking book in a small package that won't take you too long to finish!<br />May God bless you all!

I'm of the firm belief that a good story is a good story, no matter how old you are!  This beautiful picture book is Max Lucado at his best - he tells the story with a perfect economy of words and the illustrations are perfect.<br />The main character, Punchinello, lives in a world where the wooden people wear &quot;stickers&quot; which are Stars or Grey Dots, depending on what others think of you!  Poor Punchinello tries hard to gain others' approval, but keeps missing out and keeps getting grey dots, which means that he is definitely looked down upon in this make-believe society of wooden people.<br />Finally, our friend meets a wooden girl who has no stickers!  When people try to put stars on her, they don't stick!  And the grey dots don't stick either!  She explains to our main character that this is because she goes to visit Eli, the master woodcarver, who made them all.  She doesn't card about the opinions of others.  She suggests that Punchinello go visit Eli as well.<br />When Punchinello goes to visit Eli, he learns an important lesson about the specialness of each created person just because you belong to God!  The scenes in Eli's workshop are especially touching.<br />My 17-year-old just read this book and LOVED it.  We also watched the video and didn't think it was as good as the book.<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music!	2000-12-18

I was recently asked by someone who had read some of my reviews which study Bible I recommended.  Such a hard question, since there are many excellent ones available!  My answer to him compared the NIV Life Application Bible and the NIV Study Bible.  Here are my thoughts on these two, plus comments on the Quest Study Bible as well.<br />The Quest Study Bible doesn't go as deep.  I think it's perfect for someone who is just beginning to study the Bible and has lots of questions like those that are answered in the Quest Study Bible.  However, that's not to say that I already know all the answers to those questions! ;-o  It just doesn't go much deeper than those questions.<br />I have in front of me the NIV Study Bible and the Life Application Bible NIV.  They are both excellent - either one would go deeper into the Word than the Quest Study Bible.<br />The obvious differences to me are as follows:<br />Text The Life Application Bible (LAB) has the text straight across the page - the NIV Study Bible has the two-column layout.  I think I prefer the two-columns.  It is easier to get through some of those Old Testament books such as 1/2 Chronicles! ;-o  However, this is very much a matter of personal preference.<br />Notes The notes, while excellent in both Bibles, are different in tone.  The NIV Study Bible notes are  very objective and purely informational.  One of the downsides to the LAB, for me anyway, is that sometimes the notes in the LAB get rather preachy and sometimes go far afield of the text.  I'm not saying asking personal applications is a bad thing, but if you're doing a lot of reading in that Bible, it might get to be a bit much. The tone of the notes is is the reason I gave this Bible 4 stars instead of 5!  A note might ask &quot;Do you believe that God can help you?  Do you really want his help?&quot; (note for Matt 9:27-30)<br />Other helps In the back of the LAB, there is an &quot;Index to Notes&quot; which includes the maps, charts, personality profiles, and the notes.  It really isn't a concordance, but it is helpful.<br />The NIV Study Bible has an Index to Maps separately, an Index to Subjects, and a Concordance.  The Concordance isn't exhaustive, of course, but it is much better than the one in the LAB.  <br />The LAB wins the contest in the &quot;Personality Profiles&quot; category.  They have quite a detailed description of all the key people you'll meet in the Bible - they often cover about 2/3 of a page!!    In the NIV Study Bible, these personality notes are relegated to just a few lines in the Notes section!  The LAB definitely is the winner in this category.<br />Both Bibles contain a Harmony of the Gospels, something I find really helpful.  The LAB, however, numbers each event in the Gospels, and before the section in the text, it gives this number and then gives the passages in the other gospels that tell the same story.  I found the number to be really helpful.  The NIV Study Bible doesn't have such numbers.  <br />I could go on and on, but you get the idea!  Those are the main differences, I think!!  Both Bibles are excellent.  I haven't found any others that are better.  I also have the NIV Living Insights Study Bible that has Chuck Swindolls notes, but the notes aren't as complete. Also, the &quot;Word in Life Study Bible&quot; is chockfull of different kinds of sidebars and articles and is just wonderful as well.   I had purchased the Large-Print Edition of the NIV Study Bible because of some temporary vision problems.  The Large-Print Edition of the NIV Study Bible doesn't have HUGE print - just a bit bigger than most Bibles.  I still use that Bible a LOT and it's just comfortable reading.  It is a bit bigger and heavier than my LAB, but not by a lot.  I really like the larger type.  You can get REALLY large print, but that's not what this.<br />I hope this is helpful!

I just finished reading this little gem of a book.  No, I didn't read the devotionals one per day, but I think that would be the BEST way to read this book.<br />This book is very attractive and would make a wonderful gift!  The words and subtle but lovely drawings are in a burgandy color.  <br />31 Christmas carols each have their own chapter.  Teach chapter contains the author and date for the carol, then the words to the carol (including all those wonderful extra verses that many people don't know!).  Next comes a bit of background on the writing of the carol and/or the theological points that are covered in the lyrics.  Then there is a &quot;Reflection&quot; and some Bible passages that fit with the carol, and then a prayer.  Most of the chapters are 5 pages long.<br />The emphasis is NOT on how the author got the idea the carol, or the circumstances surrounding the writing of it (though that is included in several of the chapters).  The emphasis is on finding Christ in the carols and how these carols express so beautifully the glorious and mysterious incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ!<br />Please check out my other reviews of Christian books!	2000-11-29

Frank Peretti is well-known for novels about spiritual warfare.  This is the first non-fiction book he has written and it will impact your life dramatically!!<br />Peretti tells his own story (which he hasn't told openly until only recently) of growing up with a medical condition that left him disfigured and also small and underdeveloped for his age.  <br />The first chapter &quot;A Boy's Hell&quot; describes the scene in the boys' locker room when Peretti was in junior high.  His story is powerful - you will never forget it!  It is brutally honest and it is also hard to read.  Your heart goes out to this young boy who has had to endure so much torment at the hands of his peers.  <br />The horrific treatment followed him into high school, until finally someone showed an interest in him and in so doing, helped stop the chain of abuse in Peretti's life.  <br />The Wounded Spirit is not about only kids being mean and abusive to other kids.  This is about our society and how we treat each other.  He points out how these problems are also present in adult relationships.  He calls the strong people (who might perhaps be the ones being mean) to be the protector of the less strong.  <br />Instead of merely telling a moving story and outlining the problem, Peretti has good constructive things that can be done about it.  He has advice for the wounded and for the wounders!  He has advice for teachers and other adults in charge in those situations where kids are being wounded by other kids.  <br />Ultimately, healing can only come through Jesus Christ - through Him, we can break this cycle of victimization and abuse.	2000-11-20

The basic nutrition information given in this book is excellent.  If you eat only 20 grams of fat and 30 grams of fiber per day, you WILL lose weight and you WILL be eating a lot healthier!!<br />The author does an excellent job of explaining WHY this kind of diet will help prevent disease and promote excellent health.<br />However, I think that the 20 grams of fat allowed per day is on the low side.  Also, in looking at the listings of foods (taking up about the last half of the book), I saw that the author really believes that we shouldn't consume any beef or chicken!!  He has symbols for &quot;eat all you want&quot; foods (fruits, veggies, etc), foods to cut back on, and foods that have the time bomb as the symbol.  Under beef, there isn't one single item listed that doesn't have a time bomb symbol!!<br />I have lost weight myself on a low fat/high fiber diet, and I'm currently on Weight Watchers.  In my opinion, Weight Watchers is much more liveable in the long run.  On Weight Watchers, you can have a favorite food if you just count the Points.<br />To be fair, the 20/30 Plan allows for 2 meals a week where you can eat whatever you want, as long as you don't go overboard.  But the recipes in this book are based on mainly whole grains and beans.  I do think eliminating meats is excessive.  I think that the emphasis should be on LEAN meats and poultry, and small serving sizes.<br />If you can eat this way, I think that's great!  I just don't think it's very practical for the average person who is trying to lose weight.<br />For low fat/high fiber healthy recipes, I highly recommend any of the Weight Watchers cookbooks (the newer ones that have recipes for the current 1-2-3 Success program).<br />Another interesting book on weight loss and healthy eating is Volumetrics.  Please check my review of this book here on Amazon (as well as reviews of cookbooks - though not necessarily low-fat ones!&lt;g&gt;).<br />I wish you all the best in the quest for better health!	2000-11-18

I read this book eagerly as I did with &quot;Fighting Fat After Forty&quot; and as I plan to do with &quot;20/30 Fat &amp; Fiber Diet Plan&quot;.  I'm trying to pick the best info from all these books and incorporate these theories into a plan that works for ME - along with Weight Watchers!<br />The premise of the book is that foods that have more water in them will leave us more satisfied than more calorie-dense foods.  The example that helps you visualize it is the small amount of raisins in a bowl.  For the same number of calories as 1/4 cups of raisins, you can eat almost 2 cups of grapes!  And the grapes would leave you more satisfied.  <br />The theory, by its very nature, will lead you to low-fat, high-fiber foods.  Fresh fruits, vegetables, hot cereals such as oatmeal and other whole grains are excellent choices.  And the book does accept the fact that there are some &quot;energy-dense&quot; foods too delicious to give up (like chocolate!).  <br />I thought the book could've been organized better and could have given more direction after they had presented the main points of the book.<br />However I see from Amazon's listings that a sequel to the book, coming out in early 2001, will probably take these issues further and be even more of a help to those wanting to eat more and weigh less.<br />This book is definitely worth reading, but also utilize your good common sense about nutrition and read other books as well.  And don't deprive yourself of an occasional high energy density treat because deprivation just leads to frustration and giving up.<br />I feel that Weight Watchers is a very sensible, well-balanced approach to weight loss that encourages healthy eating.  I highly recommend it.	2000-11-13

The premise of the books is that our bodies don't know the difference between &quot;fight or flight&quot; (the kind of stress built into our bodies when God created us in order to hang onto needed calories during a crisis situation)and normal everyday stress which we all have.  <br />Dr. Peeke said that Stress Eating causes Toxic Weight - I think most of us know that, even if we don't use those terms.  She does use research to back up her ideas.  She talks of the &quot;cortizone&quot; - the hours between 3pm and midnight when most stress eating happens.  Most people simply don't &quot;stress eat&quot; first thing in the morning she says.<br />She says that our goal should be stress resiliance.  And if we want cookies, we should eat 1-2 &quot;real&quot; cookies rather than half a box of the fat-free variety.  An excellent point!!  We have to watch calorie intake, not just fat grams! <br />Like any good eating plan, the emphasis is on eating high nutrition foods.  She also mentions &quot;glycemic index&quot; made popular by Dr. Weil in another book.  Which boils down to - some foods stick with you better than others.  An apple will keep you satisfied longer than a handful of grapes, though both are good foods.  A bowl of oatmeal will hold you over til lunch better than a bowl of Frosted Flakes.  <br />Dr. Peeke spends a large part of the book talking about exercise and she recommends Dr. Cooper's Institute.<br />&quot;Treading weight&quot; is an interesting concept that's discussed in the book. When stress hits, control your eating enough to maintain, but don't expect to lose during that time.  I think that's very sensible - so many of us fall off the proverbial wagon when we've had 1 day of poor eating choices and figure that all is lost.  <br />Dr. Peeke recommends eating 65% of one's daily calories before 5pm.  While this probably makes good sense from a scientific point of view, I thinkmany will find that hard to do when most families eat their &quot;big meal&quot; together at 6pm or later.  I do think that cutting back on late-evening snacking can't do anything but help!<br />I don't believe that any one book or program has the complete picture of this complicated issue.  As for myself, I picked up a couple tips from &quot;Fighting Fat&quot;, but I've also joined Weight Watchers, and I'm reading other books such as &quot;Volumetrics&quot; and &quot;20/30 Fat and Fiber Diet&quot;, both of which I'm finding fascinating and helpful.<br />One last thing - I agree with one of the other reviewers that the author's creation of the word &quot;menopot&quot; to the describe shapely tummies that some of us mature women have, will be slightly offensive to some.  Some of us, for a variety of reasons such as multiple abdominal surgeries, multiple pregnancies, medical problems, etc, will never have flat stomachs and I believe that God did not mean for all women be built alike.  Of course we should all strive for inproved health and fitness, but that could well be different for each woman.<br />Enjoy reading this book.  You can take away some helpful ideas from this book.  Just don't make it the only book you read on healthier eating!	2000-10-30

Ilene succeeds beautifully in this wonderful combination.<br />From the book: &quot;What do five girls - one short, one tall, one buxom, one flat, one who gave birth a month ago - have in common?  A bridesmaid's dress they all hate.&quot;<br />Throughout the book, Ilene zigs and zags from telling about planning her daughter's wedding to writing about her daughter as a little girl and their very special relationship during her grown-up years.  In a world where way too many people can't wait for their children to grow up and leave home, this type of writing is both poignant and refreshing.  <br />Here's a letter that the author wrote to her daughter as the wedding grew nearer &quot;I never knew before I had you that I could love anyone so much.  You won't understand the feeling until you hold your own baby in your arms.  I'm afraid you won't need me now that youo're married.  I helped you get over your separation anxiety in nursery school.  Now I need youto help me to get over mine.&quot; Then she says that she never sent that letter.<br />I really appreciated the review of this book that was written by a husband and father who called himself &quot;A reader from NJ&quot;.  He says that this book isn't just for women and I wholeheartedly agree. My husband laughs and cries simultaneously when watching his favorite movie &quot;Father of the Bride.&quot;  I think I'm going to go show him this book right now.	2000-09-25

Margaret got the ideas for the stories in a unique way - she asked people to submit personal stories about sibling relationships and she would pick some to be included in this book.  She stayed true to the original content of the story, but changed some names and added a few things to flesh out these stories which are all told in first person.  <br />The book is a beautiful thing to behold - just from an artistic point of view!  The cover is lovely, the pictures are precious.  They aren't black and white photos, but are in pastel tones.  Very interesting. Also, Margaret includes quotes about sibling relationships from poetry and literature.  <br />The stories are all very different from each other - they are all excellent.  At first reading, I like &quot;The Exchange&quot; and the following story (it's the last one - I don't have the book handy to give you the name of it) the best.  These stories will touch your heart in a special way and cause you to reflect on your own sibling relationships.  Those of you who don't have brothers and sisters (like me!) can get a glimpse into these very special sibling relationships.<br />This would definitely make a wonderful Christmas gift for a brother or sister!  I highly recommend Margaret Becker's music as well!  Her latest album &quot;Friend For Life&quot; is a good place to start!	2000-09-24

I eagerly awaited the release of this cookbook because I have the yellow  ring-bound Pillsbury Cookbook that was published back in 1979.  The yellow  Pillsbury cookbook has been my all-time favorite cookbook of all time.   I've made MANY recipes from there over the years.<br />Pillsbury makes  incredible cookbooks (as well as those monthly cookbook magazines you can  get by mail or at the grocery store check-out!) and this new one is no  exception.  <br />It has all the basics that a beginning cook needs to know -  how long to cook a beef roast, emergency substitutions, a chapter on  freezing and canning, a cooking glossary, a guide to utensils, and much  more!  <br />I love the ring-bound format because the book lays flat (I'd  recommend a page-protector or some plastic over the recipe as you're  working though, to prevent spills on your new cookbook! &lt;g&gt;).   <br />This cookbook's recipes are for just plain good cooking!  Not a lot of  exotic ingredients are included, but you will find some of the more recent  additions into cookbooks such as a chapter on Vegetarian Cooking.<br />The  cookbook is divided into 12 sections, each separated by a very lightweight  cardboard stock with a tab of the same paper extending past the edges of  the recipe pages, indicating the topic of that section.  The reason I  mention this is that I really feel that Pillsbury could've spent a little  more on this cookbook and made the dividers from a stiffer cardboard and  made the divider tabs especially in such a way where they would stand up to  heavy use (since this cookbook is one you might use constantly!).<br />Perhaps  I'm spoiled by having the other one, but in the 1979 model, the dividing  pages have much stiffer cardboard and I just recently lost the first tab  from that cookbook - after 21 years!!<br />The 1979 yellow edition was ahead  of it's time by providing full nutrition facts, including fat grams!  My  other criticism of the new book is that the Nutrition Information is  printed in such teeny-tiny print that it's quite hard to read!  The  Nutrition info text in the old cookbook is quite a bit larger!<br />Perhaps  Pillsbury was saving space by using a small font, but personally I'd rather  pay a few extra dollars and get a cookbook which will stand stand the test  of time in both readability and durability.<br />Please note that these are  the ONLY criticisms I have of this fine cookbook!  It is a wonderful basic  cookbook to have on hand!  And it would make an excellent gift for any  cook, from the newly married and just starting out, to the experienced  cook.	2000-09-15

This 12-chapter book is not difficult reading, but has many  valuable insights which bear reflecting on.  <br />There are questions at the  end of each chapter and I feel that taking the time to write out the  answers and look up the pertinent verses is a valuable learning tool.  It  does, however, take much longer to get through the book that way!  <br />In  the first part of the book, Mimi Wilson dealt with the different names of  God and what those names mean to us in our practical day-to-day lives as  Christians.  She lists &quot;Holy Habits&quot; for us to follow.  For  example, God Is Elohim can be expressed by hooking yourself into his  transcendance and looking for His fingerprints in the world and telling  others about what you see.  For God is Yahweh, the author recommended  looking at every day as a gift from God.  In the chapter on God as  Yahweh-Shammah, the &quot;holy habit&quot; was to silence one's heart daily  so we can be sensitive to God's presence.  <br />The last two chapters are  entitled &quot;Daily Contentment&quot; and &quot;Walking with the Eternal  One&quot; and I feel that they do the best job of summing up the main  points of the book.<br />The bibliography section is excellent as well (I  often get ideas for other books to read from the list of recommended  books!)<br />This book would be ideal for a women's Bible Study group, or for  individual study.  If you're interested in books of this type, you might  try Elizabeth George's books as well.  <br />May God bless you richly as you  study His Word!	2000-09-15

I really enjoy the  length of the line of print this produces.  Sometimes single-column text is  a bit long to keep one's interest and sometimes the double-columns seem  just too short.  <br />The margins contain the questions and answers which  make the Quest Study Bible unique.  The questions are ones that you very  possibly have wondered about over the years.  A couple of examples are:  &quot;Should Christians sell their possessions and give to the poor?&quot;  (Mark 10:21) and &quot;Why did Jesus tell Mary not to hold onto him?&quot;  (John 20:17).  The margins also contain &quot;scripture links&quot; which  might tell you where else in the Bible that the story is related.  <br />The  book introductions are excellent, covering reasons for readin the book,  wrote wrote the book, to whom was it written, when was it written, what  else was happening to the world at that time, and things to look for.  Each  Bible book intro also has a timeline which helps put things in  perspective.<br />On some pages, the margins might have a small area map to  help you understand where all this took place. The margins also have plenty  of room for making your own notes. <br />There are also short articles at the  bottoms of some of the pages which discuss a certain issue more thoroughly.   I enjoy the Index to Subjects, and the Concordance.  The full-color maps  in the back are very helpful also.<br />This Bible has several reading plans  for you to follow according to what your goal is in studying God's Word.   You can cover the Life and Teachings of Jesus (briefly!) in two weeks.   They tell you how to get a general overview of the whole Bible in 6 months,  and how to read through the entire Bible in i3 years.  If you're interested  in reading the whole Bible in a year (I highly recommend it!), you might  want to check out &quot;The One Year Bible - New Living Translation&quot;  and &quot;The One Year Bible Companion&quot;.  I wrote reviews on Amazon  for both of these books.<br />Another feature of the Quest Bible that I really  have learned a lot from is the 4-page chart of the Kings of Israel and  Judah which the editors included between 2 Kings and 1 Chronicles.  This  helps you keep track of who was king in which area during which year and  what the corresponding passages in 1&amp;2 Kings and 1&amp;2 Chronicles  contain that history.  Even more interesting, the chart tells which of the  prophets were around for which rulers.  This chart really pulled that whole  period of history together for me.<br />This Bible would make a great gift for  someone who is just starting to read the Bible, or for someone who has been  reading for a long time.  <br />The only thing that they left out that I'd  like to see in this Bible is a cross-reference system.  <br />May God bless  your study of his Word!

The whole series follows a &quot;Pre-Trib&quot; point of view; this book  begins two years into the Tribulation.  The word pictures that Jerry  Jenkins paints remain vivid in the reader's mind.

The potential problem is that people could think  that this is exactly how things will happen.

I have done some study of Revelation - it is a book  which is so complex and so rich that I feel I haven't even scratched the  surface.  <br />And I know that as a result of reading this series, I will  definitely go back and re-read Revelation and study it further.<br />I would  encourage anyone who is enjoying the Left Behind series to check out the  authors' non-fiction book about end times Revelation theology.

I really enjoyed reading this book.  At first, I was a tad skeptical, thinking &quot;What, only 4 personality types?&quot;  Like the &quot;Reader from Chicago&quot; below, I believe that the Myers-Briggs personality  inventory gives a better picture since there are 16 types!  <br />Having said  that, everyone is a unique individual and even with the Myers-Briggs 16  categories, those don't always fit perfectly.<br />I'm intrigued by books that  discuss different ways that people relate to the Lord.  I took the  &quot;test&quot; and I came out &quot;Popular Sanguine&quot; and the 2nd  highest was &quot;Perfect Melancholy&quot;.  Interestingly enough, the  &quot;reader from Chicago&quot; down below tested the same way and her  Myers-Briggs type is an ESFJ and so is mine!   <br />Back to the subject at  hand...  I did read the whole book and even though certain sections didn't  really talk about where I'm coming from at all, it helped me to understand  how others may have a different format for their time alone with Jesus.   <br />And I came to realize that, to the outside observer, and in the general  world, I do have the traits of the Popular Sanguine.  But when I'm relating  to my Lord, I'm much more of a Perfect Melancholy!  <br />Betty and Marita  give many good examples of how the different types might structure (or not  structure) their devotional lives and they even suggest particular books,  devotionals, Bible versions/formats and even journaling techniques.<br />The  only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think a personality  profile with only 4 types is over-simplified, even when it is pointed out  that very few people are totally one type.<br />Thank you, authors, for  writing this fascinating book!   I'll look forward to more from you!  <br />If  you're interested in Christian books and music, please click on the  &quot;see more about me&quot; link and read some of my other reviews!  :-)<br />Signed, Popular Sanguine with a heavy Perfect Melancholy attribute in  relation to my devotional life, and also an ESFJ on the Myers-Briggs!	2000-07-27

The books  are great because through the characters,  you can more easily understand  the different events. <br />I especiallly enjoyed reading about the two  witnesses (near the Wailing Wall in Israel) which are talked about in this  passage:<br />(Rev 11:3 NIV)  And I will give power to my two witnesses, and  they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.&quot;<br />I'm almost  done with Nicolae and I have the next two books after THAT one in the  house!  <br />These books are fast-moving and enjoyable reading.

First I read most of the Amy Carmichael one (called A Very Present Help), but I lost it before I finished it! (I had to order another one!)<br />So I started  this one.  And I just love it.  All the devotionals in this series are  similarly arranged.  Each day's section starts out a general statement that  summarizes the topic, then there's Scripture, sometimes combining passages  from 2 or more books of the Bible, on the same theme.  Then there is a  selection from a Corrie Ten Boom book.  Then there are a couple of  questions to think about and a prayer.  These can be easily completed in 10  minutes, but sometimes I linger on them and reread them.  I usually do one  per day, but sometimes they are so good I just want to do another one.   <br />This book would be wonderful for any Christian desiring to grow in his  or her walk with the Lord.  It's also a good sampling of Corrie Ten Boom's  writings.  You'll probably want to get some of Corrie's books after reading  this devotional.  Her main story is told in The Hiding Place and Tramp for  the Lord and then there are many other books that have short passages to  read.<br />I would recommend this book for someone who wants to jump-start  their devotional life (or it would make a great gift!).  The reading isn't  difficult and Corrie's writing is easy to understand, but very profound and  meaningful at the same time.<br />I also recommend the movie &quot;The Hiding  Place&quot;.<br />Please read my other reviews of Christian books!	2000-07-01

This book details the chronology of events from Cassie as a sweet little girl to a rebellious teen, out of control and participating in occult behavior.  Then Cassie becomes a Christian and their last couple of years  together as a family were much improved.<br />The point of the book is not  whether or not Cassie actually said &quot;yes&quot;  in the Columbine  library.  She said &quot;yes&quot; to Jesus in her life.<br />I appreciate  Misty Bernall's ability to document her daughter's life so that others may  benefit by her story.  However, I do think that perhaps the book was  written somewhat hurriedly and could be clearer in parts.  Mrs. Bernall  uses a lot of quotes from friends of Cassie's and others to fill in  details.  <br />I would definitely recommend this book.  This is a story of  parents who fought desperately to get their daughter back and they  succeeded.  I hope it inspires other parents who feel that they've lost  their children to the unmorality (perhaps the word should be amorality) of  today's society.	2000-06-26

This book and the subsequent ones in the series are books  that elicit a response in everyone, of one kind or another!<br />I just  finished Left Behind and I'm going to try to read all of the books in the  series this summer (as of now, there are 7).  I plan to read them one right  after the other, so maybe starting late isn't such a problem.  <br />This book  was quick reading and I felt that Jerry Jenkins did a great job developing  his characters and he wove his story around the Revelation theology  outlined by Tim LaHaye.  I've heard that there is a video out of the video  in the book - when the pastor of the church makes a video before the  Rapture and leaves it for those who are left behind to explain what has  happened.  This would be interesting to see!  <br />This book is fast-reading  and is very hard to put down!  It's very thought-provoking and it makes the  Great Commission given to us by Jesus all the more urgent:<br />(Mat 28:19-20  NIV)  Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the  name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,  and teaching  them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you  always, to the very end of the age.&quot;<br />I am looking forward to reading  Tribulation Force.  <br />If anyone is interested in reading about the  Biblical basis for what happens in the book in regard to the Rapture of  Christ's Church and the End Times, you might want to read a book called  &quot;Are We Really Living in the End Times?&quot; by the same authors as  the Left Behind series.<br />I praise God that this series has had such an  impact on people - they have a website: <br />[...]<br />You can  find stories there of people turning their lives around and making  decisions to trust Christ as a result of reading these books.  <br />May the  Lord use this series to make Christians realize the importance of telling  people the Good News and also helping us make sure that we're right with  God as no one knows the day or the hour.  <br />If you're interested in  Christian books and music, please check out my other reviews of Christian  music and CDs!	2000-06-18

I bought this book a few months ago after a friend recommended it.  My friend has a cooking partner and they've been cooking this way for well over a year now.  My circumstances do not allow me to spend a whole day  cooking meals, but I have used the ideas and recipes in the book to fit our  family.  Instead of spending a whole day cooking enough dinners for a  month, I will make 2 or 3 meals' worth of a recipe when I do cook.  I  freeze what we don't eat and I've accumulated quite a good supply of meals  that are in the freezer.  <br />Tara and Nanci have developed quite a system.   There are charts and worksheets that are extremely helpful.  This book is  not just a book of recipes that freeze well.  It's chock-full of  information and techniques.  Also, 30daygourmet.com is their website and  they have message boards (with the authors participating!) and if you own  the book, you can see and print out an additional 50 recipes, set up just  like the ones in the cookbook!<br />The ingredients are listed in quantities  for one meal, then they do all the math and multiply out what you need for  however many meals you want to make.  <br />The recipes are very  family-friendly and delicious.  No strange ingredients that you would have  trouble finding.  Everything I've made from the cookbook has been  WONDERFUL.  I've made the Taco Rice (serve it with cornbread - yummy!),  Crispy Baked Chicken, Saucy Oven Pork Chops (recipe from website),  Cheeseburger Quiche (also from website), and Cheese-Stuffed Shells.  I made  80 shells last time I made them and you freeze them in rigid containers and  they don't stick together and to cook them, you just take out however many  you need in the morning and put them in the fridge and at dinnertime, put  them in a cooking dish with spaghetti sauce on the bottom (I use Ragu!) and  cover with more sauce and bake.  Absolutely delicious!<br />This is a great  way to have homecooked meals without having to cook every night.  I really  enjoydoing it!  God bless you, Nanci and Tara! <br />PS Nanci and Tara also  do conferences where they give a demonstration of their cooking methods.  I'd love to see one of those - they also have a great sense of humor!  With  7 kids between them, they really know what it's like to have a chaotic  dinner hour!<br />Cooking this way saves you time and money and gives your  family great meals.  I can see that this would be useful for anyone - from  young singles or newly-married to families with children at home to empty  nesters!  You won't be disappointed with this book!	2000-06-14

Now that they're combined, you have the whole thing in one book and what a book it is!<br />Ken Gire's writing  really will touch your heart.  The book consists of over 60 chapters, each  of which contains Scripture, a meditation, and a prayer.  The chapters are  in chronological order and are all moments in the life of Christ.  <br />I  can't think of a better book to give someone who is wanting to learn more  about Jesus and is just starting out.  However, this is not just for  newcomers to the faith.  Ken Gire presents fresh insights into these events  in Jesus' life here on earth.  <br />I use this book for looking up  information on certain passages in the Gospels for greater understanding  and use in a group Bible Study.  It's a great resource!<br />In addition to  the chapters taken from the 4 separate books, there are 20 totally new  chapters!  <br />This book would be great to have on hand for  gift-giving!<br />PS I also highly recommend Ken Gire's book called Windows of  the Soul.	2000-06-08

I wish that title section was longer! <br />Anyway, I've kept coming back to this title on Amazon and I'm very surprised no one has written a review for this book yet!  I read it back in  October and was waiting for someone else to write that first review.  But  they haven't and it's time for all you Amazon browsers to know about this  wonderful book!<br />Chris Fabry and his wife Andrea have a large family in  the suburbs of Chicago.  Chris used to be the co-host of &quot;Mornings  with Greg and Chris&quot; on WMBI in Chicago (great Christian radio station  - both teaching and music).  Even though he hasn't been on the air for  close to a year now, I still miss him and was thrilled to hear that he  would be writing more books!<br />This book is the kind of book that you can  pick up and read a chapter and put it down for a day, a week or a month,  and pick it back up and you won't have lost anything because these short  vignettes are complete unto themselves.  <br />Having said that, however, I  believe I read the book in 2 sittings!  Chris's style in his book is warm  and friendly - his way of telling about his wife and children (and other  family members) really makes you feel like you know them.  <br />But this book  is not just a book of warm fuzzy stories.  Chris has shared some of his  experiences of seeing God in the everyday, mundane situations of life we  all have.  Just be reading the book, you will be better able to see the  hand of the Lord of the universe in *your* life!<br />Some of the stories  really hit me hard.  Chris writes very honestly about his own feelings and  makes himself vulnerable, which is a very very brave thing to do.  I must  add that when Chris was on WMBI and his wife Andrea was hosting the best  Christian syndicated call-in show in the country, they actually were on  MidDay Connection together talking about their marriage, including a real  close hard look at some difficult times in their marriage.I really  admired them for that.<br />Back to the book... Most of the stories had my  laughing and crying within the same 2-minute period.  Not everyone can  write like that!  Parents especially will enjoy this book.  My own children  are older now, and this book reminded me of some of the similar times we  had when they were little.  <br />I was just looking through the book again  trying to pick out highlights.  It's really hard - the whole book is great,  but here's the topics of a few: Chris taking his daughter on her first  date, a trip to the pediatrician (boy, could I identify with that one - we  wanted them to install a drive-through window whereby you could stick the  child's head out the window and the doctor could check ears and throats, at  the next window you'd pay and get your prescription for the inevitable  amoxicillin that Chris talks about in his book).  <br />Another wonderful  story was one of the first ones in which Chris and Andrea were going for a  walk and Chris was... er... hmmm... not really paying attention.  And  there's a classic where daughter Kristin (who used to say  &quot;Jofuss&quot; instead of Joseph when telling the Christmas story from  Luke 2) got &quot;God bless you&quot; in her Rice Krispies and that raised  the question - what do *we* do when something comes and messes up our day,  our week, our life? <br />And one of the most touching stories is called  &quot;I Didn't Even Know Her Name&quot; which was about an apparently  homeless woman who hung around the office building where the radio station  had their offices.  The story talks about how we tend to hang around with  people like us.  We tend to avoid people who are different, whether their  clothes tattered, or they're smelly, or their conversation is somewhat  fragmented.  Didn't Jesus come to minister to those people too?  Chris is  very honest about his feelings in this story and they changed at the end.   Really makes you think.  <br />Thanks Chris, for letting usinto your life and  your home, and your thoughts.  When is the next book coming out? <br />As for  people reading this review, order several copies!  It would make a great  gift to have on hand!	2000-05-08

Okay, I finished this book!  You'll find my initial review below - I was the first reviewer of this book.  This book has impacted me more than any other book I've read on the subject of having daily Quiet Times with the  Lord.  If you need to be convinced of the need for this in your own  Christian walk, or you need to get back on the path, please read this book!   Nancy Leigh DeMoss does such an outstanding job with this book.  Chapter  6, entitled &quot;The Hard Thing for me is...&quot; discusses many  &quot;excuses&quot; or things that stand in the way of having productive  daily devotional times.  The author addresses all these issues and gives  really practical and helpful suggestions, all the while giving examples  from her own life.<br />One of the women in our small group Bible Study had  been to a Women's Conference where Nancy Leigh DeMoss spoke on this issue  &quot;Devotional Time: Duty or Delight&quot; and she came back and told our  group about it.  I was already reading this book and after hearing about  the conference and looking at my book, every woman in our group wanted the  book for themselves and already several of them are reading it and reaping  the benefits of a closer walk with the Lord!   Nancy, when are you writing  another book?	2000-05-05

Gorgeous pictures too!	I checked this out of our public library and then realized that I just HAD to buy this cookbook!  The first recipe I made was the one with the cover &quot;Raspberry-Lemon Struesel Muffins&quot;.  These will be a family  favorite for years!  The use of vanilla yogurt and egg whites reduces the  amount of fat and gives them a delicate texture.  The raspberries (the  frozen whole kind - no sugar added) give a taste of summer and the struesel  topping makes them extra yummy and flavorful without much added fat.<br />This  cookbook is very pleasant to browse through.  The pictures are great and  the book tells you which recipes are low-fat.  <br />This book could keep you  busy for a long long time.  Buy this cookbook and let the kids help you do  some baking this summer!	2000-05-04

Okay, I must confess, I haven't finished this book yet.  I've read about 50 pages of it.  But I really couldn't wait another day to review this incredible book.  The subtitle is &quot;Finding Intimacy with God Through a Daily Devotional Life&quot;.  This is not a book of &quot;shoulds&quot; and  plans that you have to follow to the letter.  Nancy DeMoss's enphasis is  that we shouldn't have devotional times to please God (he couldn't love us  more already), or to feed proud of ourselves, but to spend time with Jesus  Christ, the Lord of our lives!<br />The book is beautifully laid out, from the  inviting cover, to the organization of the chapters of the book to an  appendix of devotional books (I could add about 3 times as many, though!  &lt;g&gt;).  <br />The whole book centers on establishing a vibrant devotional  life, starting with the priority, the purpose, the pattern, and the  problems that come up when we're trying to have a good devotional life.  Then Nancy DeMoss has chapters on receiving the Word, responding to His  Word, <br />A great feature of this book is that at the end of each chapter,  there is a section of questions called &quot;Making It Personal&quot;.   These questions are just outstanding and get you thinking about what you've  just read and you can apply what you've learned to your life immediately.   Unlike some other study questions I've run into in other books, these  questions do not have an obvious answer and really get you thinking.  I  find that writing the answers down in a journal helps me a great deal and  it will be interesting to look back at the answers in future  years.<br />Another great feature of this book is that at the end of each  chapter (after the questions section), there is a personal reflection  written by other Christian women such as Elisabeth Elliot, Kay Arthur and  many others.  There are 12 of these vignettes, one for each chapter and  they correspond beautifully with the material in the chapter. <br />When I  finish this book, I'll write another review!  I recommend this book  highly! <br />I hope to see other reviews of the book here!  Don't you wish  you could writen authors directly!	2000-03-29

Three years ago, my daughter and I decided to read the Bible in one year.  It was the first time all the way through for both of us. My daughter had the One Year Bible (NLT) in hardcover which we had given her for Christmas.   And I had found this plan printed up in Brio magazine, so I just read the  same passages in my study bible.<br />This year our church's pastor challenged  us to consider using The One Year Bible to get through it in one year.  I  decided to do it again and this time I am using the One Year Bible/NLT and  my husband is using One Year Bible/NIV.  <br />I feel that the format keeps  things interesting.  A passage from the Old Testament, one from the New  Testament, something from Psalms and a snippet of Proverbs each day.  I am  finding even more stuff that I missed the first time around!  Amazing how  the Bible is really &quot;alive&quot; and when you read it at different  stages of your life, different passages impact you that you might not have  noticed the time before.<br />Rather than flipping around in the Bible, this  book has the 365 daily readings nicely laid out for you.  However, the only  downside to this is sometimes you might not really be keeping track of what  book of the Bible you're reading!  That's very easy to do, especially with  the short books both in the Old and New Testament.<br />Another nice feature  of this Bible is that for each day's selections, a passage is in bold type  -something to pay special attention to.<br />This method is great for someone  who wants to read the Bible through, but doesn't want to go from Genesis to  Revelation.  Reading Mark's gospel really makes it easier to get through  Leviticus! <br />I'd highly recommend buying &quot;The One Year Bible  Companion&quot;.  The subtitle is &quot;Questions and answers to help you  make the most of your daily Bible reading&quot;.  There are 4 questions and  answers per daily reading.  Also, the Companion lists the passages to be  read for the day at the top,so you could read in this order but with your  own Bible.  The questions help illuminate some of the somtimes confusing OT  passages.  The Companion also has brief introductions for all the books of  the Bible.<br />A bonus about &quot;The One Year Bible Companion&quot; - the  cover is a very durable plastic-like cover.  It's very durable and  flexible.  Just another added feature.  And of course, it's available from  Amazon!  That's where I got mine!  :-)<br />Happy Bible Study, everyone!	2000-03-10
