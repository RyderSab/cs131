If Johanna Lindsey (&quot;JL&quot;) has written it, I've read it .... JL is one of those authoresses who I 'generally' find to have a unique storyline, that's fast paced and romatically 'fulfilling' (heck that's why we read her books)!<br />When I first picked up this book I was a little sceptical as to how good it was going to be, but at the end of the book I was really pleased that I picked this 'baby' up!  Having been unfulfilled through reading a lot of other authoresses, historical romances, it was good to be able to come back to 'an oldie' and know that she is still as good as ever!  Don't ever stop writing JL!!<br />Rowland is the 'main' man in the story, who in my opinion has a hard exterior but a soft sweet one underneath .... Brigitte is a 'spunky' heroine ... the era we are reading about is 'hard',in terms of womens 'place' in society (&quot;little&quot; women, barefoot pregnant in the kitchen, kind of thing), but JL still manages to wind her magic/spell around the storyline and provides a wonderfully sweet romance!<br />If you i) enjoyed 'capitve bride' or 'joining' by JL, and ii)you want a sweet romance, with a bit of old time reality in it, give this story a go, because I think you will really love this story too !	2004-06-07

This is a really great book BUT it doesn't out-do \\"dance <BR>with the devil\\" (in my estimation the best of the Dark Hunter series yet)!<br />Kiss of the night is the fast paced, suspenseful, sexy story of Wulf and Cassandra but I feel it lacks the emotional intensity SK portrayed in \\"dance with the devil\\" .... I want to say, at this point, that doesn't mean it is a bad story only that it is different!  Wulf and Cassandra's story is more upbeat and less intense .... it made me laugh out loud at times, but never made me feel so emotionally attached to either Cassandra or Wulf that I wanted to cry at any point ... some people may find this more appealing than an emotionally intense story - I dare you to read both ... you won't be disappointed in either but you will understand what I mean about the books been totally incomparable!<br />How could I possibly give SK's books anything less than a 4+? It's not a possibility, so I gave this baby a 5! I think if you've enjoyed SK's books to date, you'll enjoy this one too ..... if this is your first SK novel then just know that it's not her best in this series (eg it is a must that you read \\"dance with the devil\\").	2004-05-20

Well, I have finally found another authoress worth her weight in gold!<br />This is simply an exquisite romance novel; full of humour, wit, sex, and independent, intelligent women!!!!!<br />I first met Anthony and Anna in 'the seduciton of sara' (Anthony's sister and Anna's best friend) and found them both amusing then ..... but Hawkins out does herself in this one!  Anthony Elliot, the Earl of Greyley, 'pits' his wits against his(unconventional) governess, Anna Thraxton (one of 'the thraxtons'): all I will say is that Anna thinks Anthony  could do with 'taking down a peg or two' and she just knows she's the one who can do it! ..... the most amusing, simply excellent storyline and romance is the result of Anna's scheme and I'm telling you now, you will not have read a story this good in a looooooooooooooooong while!  <br />I really love the St Johns men and think that Hawkins imagination and unique storylines get better and better with every story I read!<br />If you want something that is unique, entertaining, and a joy to read: then this is your one stop shop!  I give this one a 5++.	2004-01-31

Fellow readers, I am extremely happy to tell you that after FINALLY reading `taming the scotsman' I can confirm that this is certainly Kinley at her best! ...... a few months ago I blindly `stood' up for this novel (having not read it at that stage) and said that Kinley was a great writer and that I thought this novel had to be a winner ...... and I am glad I did so!<br />I have now read all of the books in the MacAllister series and `Taming the Scotsman' is an exceptionally wonderful story for Ewan ......... I could not have hoped for a more sweet story!!!!!!!!  It is great that Kinley didn't make this one morose (as Ewan sometimes seemed in other related novels), she let Ewan tell his story his own way and his personality shone through .... he is sweet, gentle, and adorable!<br />Ewan is  extremely loveable and Nora is an absolute delight!  This story fits right in with Kinley's tone for the series and oozes emotional depth and an adventuresome, amusing story that I found simply wonderful .... I will read this novel again and again, and I believe this novel is as good as &quot;born in sin&quot;, for those of you who have already read that gorgeous novel!<br />Buy it, rent it, borrow it ..... you need to read this one!  It is a grade A+ read!	2004-01-28

Zarek I simply loooooooove you!  <br />SK manages to infuse into her books 'main men' who are real ... they may be sexy \\"beasts\\" but SK's message (if you ask me) is that you always need to look under the exterior: don't judge a book by it's cover!  Just because these guys are a little rough around the edges doesn't mean they don't have their own stories to tell or that they can't make absolutely awesome 'heros' in a romance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Zarek's character is deep and dark .... but there is a heck of alot more underneath .... which I will leave you to discover; Astrid and Zareks's story is simply beautiful.  <br />This was the first dark-hunter story that I have read and it was one of the best books I have read lately ..... SK also writes as Kinley MacGregor and 'Born in Sin' is another book she has written lately that has simply hit me somewhere in the region of the heart (and is a story that I will never forget ... which is exactly the same as I feel about 'Dance with the devil') ..... these 'leading men' are different from the norm and are heart-wrenchingly superb!!!!!!!!  <br />I suggest that you borrow, buy, or rent this baby, cause it will be the best book you lay your hands on ....... but hey, make sure you like something with a twist of sci-fi or supernatural type stuff in it (cause I don't want to encourage someone who may put a nasty review on this site or anyother cause it wasn't their cup of tea!)<br />SK please keep this wonderful series coming ...

I have read a couple of other Iris Johansen novels and must admist that I think this is the best one I have read! .... this lady knows her stuff!<br />Iris Johansen (IJ) manages to fill her story's with both factual and interesting themes: this one involves dolphins (and the training of), and a lost city ........ and let me tell you it is one heck of a story!<br />Yes, IJ does infuse this story with a leading lady who has had a very abusive past (we're talking child abuse here) .... in fact, one would think that the kind of abuse this women had been through would be repugnant as a story-line for a fiction novel BUT IJ puts an angle on the abuse that puts you in the \\"shoes\\" of the leading lady enabling the reader to understand the psyche of an abused child and the effect of the abuse in adulthood .... the 'honest and emotional' dialogue is perfect for the setting and the story is exceptional.<br />I didn't actually choose this book myself, a friend lent it to me, and I have to say that this was an excellent story, with the best characterisation and plot that I have read in a long, long time: I started this book at 6pm and had finished by 2am .... and I have a baby!  <br />If you are looking for a page turner, that is interesting and adventurous, with some sex/romance chucked in sporadically then this is definitely worth your while!<br />Good reading to you, Kristina	2003-11-23

Oho ... who would think that the &quot;slightly&quot; series could get even better? Well it just has!<br />Honestly, this is the first (sorely waited) story for a side character, Freyja first appeared in 'a summer to remember', that has actually exceeded my expectations and had exactly the kind of exciting, interesting story I have believed the portrayed character, Freyja, would have (or rather demand)!!<br />Freyja Bedwyn and Joshua Moore (Marquess of Hallmere) are two thoroughly interesting characters who embark on numerous adventures together and end up falsely bethrothed along the way ..... the question for Freyja is does she want a real bethrothal with &quot;the man&quot;??  I won't ruin all the wonderfully witty things that occur in this story, but let you delve into the depths of this excellent book yourself.<br />If you love &quot;fresh&quot; story-lines, conversations that make you laugh out loud, and characters that are honest to themselves with their own feelings (and not simpering idiots) .... then this is definitely a book you will love!  Freyja is the most entertaining, unique &quot;leading lady&quot; that I have EVER read about in a romance novel ........ she is simply fabulous!<br />This is definitely worth your trouble .... buy it/borrow it, do whatever needs to be done to get your hands on it and read to your hearts content ...... you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!! .... you have my guarantee ... good reading, Kristina	2003-11-21

A summer to remember is a little different from the &quot;usual&quot; historical romance story you might find!

MB interlaces family &quot;ties&quot; (if you know what I mean) to make a memorable story ....Kit is a most entertaining wee chap and Lauren has a depth to her character that makes for a great read.<br />I must admit that when I first started this story I was thinking, hmmmm, am I going to enjoy this (a little different from your normal story-line start in a romance .... not bad or boring JUST different) BUT the story gets better and better and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire story from start to finish!<br />I have since read the second story of &quot;Bedwyn&quot; related tales and MB manages to make her story lines even better (if that were possible).... this is a wonderful read and worth the effort and time to read and buy.<br />Good reading my friends, Kristina	2003-11-20

If you like Julie Garwood, Johanna Lindsey, Stephanie Laurens, and/or Amanda Quick then I think you will probably enjoy MB!  Having exhausted all available books of the other authoresses listed above I have been searching for a new great authoress, with wonderful books I can devour!, and I think I have found her in MB!!<br />The book .....<br />Slightly married is a wonderful story with a lot of ROMANCE, humour, and a sweet story-line that keeps you turning those pages.  The wonderful thing about MB story's is that no two story-lines are the same!<br />The Bedwyns are growing on me with each subsequent story that I read (they were first introduced in 'a summer to remember') and following the tradition set in a summer to remember, Aiden is not your ordinary 'leading' man in a romance novel but is refreshingly different, not an arrogant bored rake, etc, etc .... Eve too is not your ordinary 'leading lady', she has spunk, determination, and is well sweet .... not simpering, etc, etc.<br />Thus, this was a thoroughly enjoyable novel, with enjoyable characters, and although the storyline is not action-packed it is a very good read .... it is more about the romance than it is about action or side-line-issues (e.g. action that takes the story away from the romance part of the plot) ... don't get me wrong there is a plot and story-line (a very good one actually) BUT it is definitely a ROMANCE: about feelings and emotions and love and passion and sex .... which is lovely because that's why we read romance books .... for the romance (emotions, feelings, etc)!<br />Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable story-line and a great addition to the Bedwyns growing novels!<br />Good reading my friends, Kristina	2003-11-20

I thank this book for it's existence and wonderful advice! For this very reason, I recommend this book to any first time mums .... or any expecting mums out there .... just so you know, I chose not to read the section on &quot;things that can go wrong&quot; in your pregnancy but thank goodness it was there because I really needed it in the end!<br />Goodluck in your pregnancy and good reading, Kristina	2003-11-18

Elizabeth Lowell has written some wonderful novels .... of the few I have read, I have really enjoyed Amber Beach, Pearl Cove, etc .... but when I started to read this book I realised quite soon into the book that it wasn't up to ELs usual standards!<br />Alana (our leading lady) is quite pathetic and Rafe Winter (her ex fiance ... who Alana thought was dead) while \\"nice\\" uses the line: \\"It's alright wildflower, I've come to take you home\\" far too often ... it starts to be a little irritating.  <br />All in all, I think I don't like this story because amoung other things: the males talk condescendingly to Alana, as though she is an idiot (i.e. the conversation is easy enough to interpret but Alana is of course ignorant and confused ... and misses the most obvious thigns happening around her).<br />I absolutely looooooooooooove romance novels, so I am not dissappointed because anything in the book is romantic, rather that the storyline is rather tepid ... perhaps even boring in parts.  This may be a result of reading EL books that are full of suspense, interesting factual information, and excellent and interesting storylines full of romance, hot sex scenes, and witty conversations! ... which this novel lacks.<br />This doesn't meet, in my opinion, ELs normally high standards!  But, if you're a keen EL novel lover, I guess you might enjoy this, but certianly not as much as other novels that EL has written.<br />If this is your first EL, then this is certainly the worst EL novel I have ever read .... perhaps you should borrow it from the library before you think of purchasing it!<br />Good reading, Kristina	2003-10-30

I suggest having some mathematic text books with lots of economic examples, as a back-up ... this is because I feel the examples in the book are hard to use, in the sense that you are learning something new and the examples are not straight-forward, so make the concepts hard to pick up in some parts of the book.<br />However, microeconomics is a huge subject and I wouldn't expect any one book to cover everything .... so expect to do some further reading to &quot;catch&quot; all concepts and get a good understanding of all the topics.<br />Overall, the book covers what you need to know ...	2003-10-20

Lucian, the notorious Lord of Wycliff, working for the Foreign office in search of traitors to the crown ... a curse pushes them apart but their unwanted attraction pulls them together: a battle of wills ensues and in the end will love win out? <br />Overall a really great read; a real page turner, and interesting until the very end .... (although the ending seemed slightly, only slightly, cliched to moi); I must admit that romance novels that pit hero vs heroine, in respect to fighting their feelings to the bitter end, don't endear themselves to me but this was a very well written book and I thought quite outstanding.<br />A word of warning though: don't read a Jordan novel unless you like a more &quot;risque&quot; romance novel .... this is not for the TIMID as the sex scenes fairly drip off (&quot;steamy&quot; if you get what I mean) the pages!! <br />Anyways, definitely worth a read.	2003-10-06

I should also explain that I am not endeared to romance novels where the hero and heroine fight to the bitter end for their growing affection of each other .... and this, added to my comments from above, made me a little disenchanted with the entire story.<br />However, all is not lost, if this is your first NJ it is still a relatively good read .... a word of warning though, this is not for the TIMID romance reader, there is a lot of ranchy sex scenes that practically melt the pages away!	2003-10-06

As an undergraduate student, studying econometrics I advise that this book is a very (very) basic introduction to econometrics (one-step up from basic statistics, probabilities, etc).  <br />One minus of the book, is that it lacks detailed examples of some of the key concepts (which is defintiely a must when you are learning something new) .... the concepts are detailed enough but it is always helpful to have a real world example of the concept. <br />Also, some of the chapters can induce learning overload and require intense concentration ... which I found to be quite annoying (as you do when you are a student).  If the chapters were broken up a bit more, it would be a far easier read (see my recommendation below concerning an easier read).<br />However, the appendices are most excellent for review of key prior mathmatical knowledge (probabilities,statistics, etc) ... but you will likely need to know your &quot;stuff&quot; before you attempt to read this book (which is logical really). <br />If you are interested in econometrics but not so good with maths, I recommend purchasing Schaum's outlines: an introduction to mathematical economics by Edward T Dowling, as this is a most excellent, informative book with hundreds of worked through examples.<br />Additionally, I have also recently read &quot;Learning and practising econometrics&quot; by William E Griffiths et al, and this is a far easier read than Woolridges book ... but maybe that is because I have already read Woolridges book (just a thought). <br />At any rate whilst using this book, I passed my basic econometrics 200 level course, with a pleasing grade.  So all in all, the book did do the trick!  <br />Good luck, Kristina	2003-09-28

Born in sin is one of the best historical novels I have ever read (I have read a lot of hisotrical novels) .... and yeas, the ending did make me cry (and not because they got married or anything dimwitted like that!).<br />I am impressed with Kinley MacGregor's (who I will refer to as Kinley) writing style: it is humourous, deeply emotional, and smooth ... the story seems to glide along.  It is perfect!<br />Unlike most romance novels, the &quot;hero's&quot; in Kinley's novels are not perfect, they are not &quot;rakes&quot;, they are not nasty, mean, arrogant idiots! ... I will let you discover just what kind of men Kinley's heros are BUT they are truly lovely to read about.  <br />Sin, our main man in Born in Sin, is definitely a man in need of a kind, caring women .... and Caledonia is just the women for it!  Based mainly in the highlands, this is a story about hope, romance, and family ties ... and yes the rest of the MacAllisters<BR>feature in this one, as does Simon (who I hope has his very own story, soon, too).<br />If you like a story with a difference, a romance that is emotionally fufilling and sweet, then this is definitely the book for you!<br />I actually give this book a 5++ (my top rating).<br />It's worth the read, and you will read it more than once .... I already have!<br />Kristina	2003-09-21

I have just been reading the review/s for MacGregors latest novel: Taming the scotsman.  <br />I have read 2 of MacGregors novels: born in sin and master of seduction, AND I found both books to be excellent!!  <br />MacGregor has a very enticing style of writing and I find the slant on her novels very unique: that is, the men in the novels are &quot;wounded&quot; emotionally, and in some respects this is their story (how they manage to overcome their emotional wounds to find love).  I think the 2 stories I have read are simply beautiful, and they are the kind of stories that you will read over and over again. <br />I have ordered this book, and am eagerly awaiting the read!!! I am expecting to love this book too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I am always confused when I read reviews putting down the genre of romance, especially historical romance. If you read a romance book you should expect an emotional book; emotional books aren't &quot;fluff&quot;. <br />RESPECT for this genre is direly needed; if you don't like to explore emotions don't read these types of books! And, don't insult (and the comments of these negative reviews are definitely insulting) the books, simply because you can't understand them! A little knowledge can do great harm, so unless you are quoting facts, don't bother with negative comments (NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO HEAR IT).<br />Kinley, I love your stories and I hope that you are not put off by these ridiculously, negative reviews!  We need a whole lot more romance writers like you!<br />My thanks for your wonderful novels so far, Kristina	2003-09-21

This is the first, of many, Kinley MacGregor books that I read ... the first of many because this book was exceptional!  <br />Ever had an over-protective father who just didn't want you to get married, or leave home?  Well, Emily sure has one! Given a prime opportunity to find herself a husband, Emily grabs it with both hands .... the only problem is that the man Emily grabs is her fathers hated enemy! Draven and Emily's story is humorous, sweet, and unusual ... poor old Draven doesn't know what's hit him when he meets Emily, and right from the start you know that he's fighting a losing battle ... you can expect laughter, compassion, and a sweetly haunting tale that you will never forget.  Both Emily and Draven resolve issues, both present and past, to find true love together.<br />Why are other reviewers comparing this novel to the Wolf and the Dove?  The Wolf and the Dove is one of my all time favourite books and I see no comparison in story lines here ... Master of Desire is completely different but just as good (I don't generally believe in comparing different writing styles because it is like comparing apples and oranges ... doesn't work at all):  Woodiwiss has a far more serious, intense writing style; MacGregor has a more humorous, hauntingly deep (on the emotional level) kind of writing style.  For example, main men: we're talking staunch, warrior who at one point chained and threatened to rape/beat Aisleen in the Wolf and the Dove COMPARED WITH an aloof warrior who goes out of his way to protect, nurture, and please Emily, the daughter of his hated enemy, in Master of Desire ... no comparison at all!<br />Anyways, definitely worth a read, you will no doubt do so more than once!

This is my first Stephanie Laurens novel and I must admit surprise at the prior \\"bad\\" reviews this book has received!<br />I picked this SL novel because none of my other fav. authoresses novels were about (at a bookstore) and it was a worthwhile purchase! I found the story of Amelia and Luc to be entertaining: amusing dialogue and refreshing twist (like Julie Garwood) that Hero and Heroine really do like each other in the story ... rather than having a hate/hate relationship, as some 'romance' novels do (which I don't count as \\"real\\" romances anyways).... lots of sex scenes, and an okay storyline. If you ask me, this novel is well worth the read, should you be looking for a romp with two colourful characters.<br />If, as suggested by other reviewers, this is SL at her worst THEN SLs worst is still pretty darn great!	2002-12-29

An avid Lindsey fan I was most disappointed in the tale of Sheena and Jamie. <br />This is the first Lindsey tale that I have found hard to stomach ... this was not a page turner for me! I found the storyline (kind of tedius) and characters (most annoying) quite substandard (for a writer like Lindsey!) .... I had to push myself to finish the book! This is NOT a book I will find myself reading ever again.<br />I expect after reading some of Lindseys other novels I am used to a much higher standard of writing: thus, in three words my comment on this tale is &quot;one of disappointment&quot;.	2002-11-24

Each story is vastly entertaining and follows the trials and tribulations of each man fulfilling his destiny and dream/s.<br />An avid Piers Anthony fan, I believe that this novel is one of his best works and so was surprised that only used books are available for this novel! <br />Piers Anthony's Battle Circle is original, thought provoking, and evokes emotional interest/empathy with each character (which is something worth mentioning: a truly good author is hard to come by these days!). <br />In three words, I believe you will find this book: a timeless &quot;keeper&quot;.	2002-11-24

Unfortunately, and to Abbey's despair, Michael (Mr \\"Boorfield\\") turns out not so sweet-tempered or even infact to be her fiance! ... but amongst humourous antics and misunderstandings Abbey and Michael soon realise they are made for each other.<br />This is my first Julia London read, and I also believe Julia's first novel: this was an entertaining read!  <br />My only niggling objection to this story is that in the last 1/4 of the book Abbey loses her characteristics that were abundent in the first 3/4 of the book (and made up the main portion of Abbey's character) ... changes from been a spunky wee heroine to a pathetic piece of fluff.  I feel that the introduction of the issue from Galen could have been handled slightly differently: that is that the heroine could have said \\"dammitt\\" Michael and I are married, used her spunk to join forces with Michael and ended the last 1/4 of the book on a happier note (not so down in the dungeons kind of style).  <br />I personally found the last 1/4 of the book tiresome and just too choppy: suddenly a number of obstacles are shoved between our hero and heroine, just when you felt that things should have been sorting themselves out.<br />Despite my comments above, this was a lovely story and great romance to read.  With a few changes to the end of this book I would have rated it a 5 star, so one can conclude that Julia London will hopefully be a force to reckon with in the future.  My comment on the book in three words: a good start	2002-11-18

Sinjun and Colin seemed to go from &quot;scrap to scrap&quot; (brother issue/mysterious killer issue/children issue/hero-heroine issues ... etc); personally, I believe that fewer 'issues' would have made this better .... it could have been a shorter novel.  <BR>But overall, Coulter has a lovely writing style which I enjoyed. <br />On the positive, Coulter's hero and heroine did not have a love/hate relationship (which I cannot stand .... not romantic at all!)and my personal rating of this book is: original read, quite sweet	2002-11-08
