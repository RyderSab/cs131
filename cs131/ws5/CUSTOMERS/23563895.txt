This was about the 5th AJ Quinnell book Ive read, like the others it was a great story with great writing and characters.<BR>Its a little dated, but still great. the only issue I had with is was I thought towards the end he could have gone more into detail with the story. I find (like most of his other books) the first three quaters of the book is someone planing to get revenge on someone who had wronged them, and the last 5-20 pages is them actually going through with it. Other than that, I loved it, but I still think MAN ON FIRE is his best work so far.<BR>Look For the new book commin out sometime in 2005 !!!	2005-05-18

This is a very short book, and I wasnt really expecting anything that will blow me away, but this book was much better than I thought it would be. The whole story line is just great.<BR>The characters involved, and Indian fokelore just tie in soo well. I thought this was a great little read, but you have to give it about 20 pages to actually get into the 'real' story of the book. You wont believe what happens :)	2005-03-31

The whole plot was pretty cool with trying to creat a &quot;Mahdi&quot; and to use him to run the middle east. The start kind of worried me a little cause it gos into history about the middle east, CIA, KGB and MI6... But it picked up quickly, and right to the VERY end, I loved it. There characters were great, I loved Gemmell and almost hated Hawke, but thats just me.<BR>All in all, another truely amazing book from a truely amazin author...<BR>Plese check out his other books if you can find them !!!	2005-03-30

It was slow at times, but the overall story and the way it is written, I just couldnt put it down. I thought the end was a little easy to foretell, but I have to be honest I didnt see it ending the way it did. I very much enjoyed this book, and look forward to reading other Passman novels in the future.	2005-03-22

I thought the book was a lot better and different than the movie, but I didnt find it all that scary. I guess part of the books scariness is that fact that its BASED ON A REAL STORY..... I did find it very creep and very well written. If you plan on watching the new movie comming out in April, read the bok first... its pretty short and will make a good afternoon read.	2005-03-20

First, where was Dirk's friend Giordino from the first book? Theres no mention of him at all in this one... But the plot was good, the last little turn at the end I thought was a little predictable, but overall a great read, cant wait to read Raise The Titanic !!!	2005-03-20

I thought it was great! The whole story, the characters, everything !!! <BR>The ONLY thing I hated was the part when Dirk Pitt slaps the chick on the beach after only meeting her for like 2 minutes. That was soo stupid. BUT other than that, a great story. I have since read ICEBERG, and I still liked this one better !!!	2005-03-20

When the main character starts tripping out when hes first getting insomnia was soo funny, I was right there with him seeing a bunch of weird things. The little bald doctors, the whole bit. The story was interesting, funny, a little spooky at times, overall just darn right great. Very well written and one of my new favorite Stephen King books.	2005-03-02

The way it was written made it a longer read for me in some cases, its written with a 3rd person perspective, and although its interesting, at times can get a little stupid. Overall the story was great and I thought it was a good book.	2005-03-02

I loved it. A lot of people complain saying its too short or confusing or whatever, but if you like suspenceful book, youll like this one, it keeps you second guessing the whole time and with little turns in every chapter you may THINK you know the ending, but not even close.<BR>Check it out !!!	2005-01-07

Its just what Ive come to expect from AJ Quinnell.... which is a masterpiece of writing.<BR>Wasnt very long, but the story and realistic was he presents it was incredible... It takes place quite some time ago and I didnt understand some of it due to my lack of history of the USSR and Soviet Union but I managed. What a great book. If you havent read his others, please do so, they are amazing as well !	2005-01-06

Ive read both Angels &amp; Demons and The Davinci Code, and I didnt find this story as well written as the other two but still a great story none the less. It wasnt all that long, finished it all in one day, and loved it. If you liked the others you'll like this one too. Id like to see Dan Brown make a second one including the same characters as well with Susan and David like hes done with Robert Langdon.	2005-01-06

It is a very short book, but you take soo much out of it.<BR>Its almost more of an esay about politics, life, spirituality and everything in between, but its written as almost just a plain old conversation between two people.<BR>Great book, more provoking than story.	2005-01-06

Recently finding the time, i picked it up from the library and read it. It was a great read, its written in old/middle english, but not bad enough that you cant tell whats going on.

I knoew a little of the story line before reading it, I mean, its just your basic haunted house book. It was more than that I found. It was very well written, very spooky and weird at times, and even a little erotic. The ending was surprising, and I thougt it was a great read. Not the best Matheson book Ive read, and Im sure its not the best hauted house book ever written, but its totally worth checking out!	2004-09-06

I knew what it was about roughly and thought it would make an enjoyable read. IT DID. I loved this book. It is a little dated with some of the things in the house like the record player and such, but still just a fantastic book. Great story, unique and clever with some great emotions from the lead character. Ive since watched &quot;The Omega Man&quot; which was LOSELY based on this book. I hope they make an I AM LEGEND movie, a great title and a great book.	2004-09-02

I thought that since I liked the movie so much and I was looking for something to read, Id read it. Its much like the movie where the first portion of the book is slow moving, but I found it apropriate to establish plot and character. Its a great book and an even better movie.<BR>Read the book first if you can, then buy the movie.	2004-09-02

After reading it, I LOVED IT. I fell in lov right away with the characters and the whole idea of the world they live in. Its a reasonably short read, but there is soo much to take form it other than just the story.<br />I really loved the ending of the book, it was soo fitting and right for the story. Most people I know perfer 1984 over BNW, but I say BNW is better. Dont take my word for it, read it for yourself, even if you think 1984 is the better book, at least you've read a literary classic!!!	2004-08-14

Having already seen the movie, I alredy knew what to expect, but I was wrong. The book is soo much better and DIFFERENT than the movie which is great. The story is basically the same outline, but there is just soo much more heartfilled moments in the book u just couldnt capture on film. So much sorrow and sadness and of course happiness. Not a long read, but the amount of feelings u get out of this book just might change the way you think and live your life. It made me reflect on my life and the people in it that I love and take for granted.<BR>Just a powerfull thought and emotional prevoking story, and Im not ashamed to say that I loved it.<BR>totally worth the read.	2004-08-14
