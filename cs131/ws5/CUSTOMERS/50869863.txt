This is my second read from this author about the,Ballantyne boys. Cassidy and Kirkland's story was great, she the older woman by nine years and he the younger man fell in love with one another. Cassidy was in a car accident, when Kirkland came along to the scene and had to deliver her baby, he gets to know her and the baby whom she name Courtney after him, and they fall in love despite problems from both sides of their family. I love how Cassidy stuck by Kirkland's side through every situation he encountered, even when he was wrong. In the first book, i loved Kirkland's sister-in-law Sutton, and felt sorry for the pain she went through with her first husband, but in this book the way she was acting made me really dislike her, she had no right to hold against Kirkland what her husband did to her. I was really proud of Kirkland in this book. I look forward to the next Ballantyne, \\"Chevy\\".	2005-06-13

Ms. Louise rights a good story, i just think the characters personality could have been a little stronger. Destiny had three men in her life. Rico the ex from hell, Davis the ex who was hoping for another chance, and Xavier who was in love with her, and she in love with him. The story of them falling in love while working on photos for his next album was great, i just wish Destiny had left Davis behind earlier in the story, she really had him believing that they could have another chance together when she was building a relationship with Xavier. Her friend Jacqueline was crazy and off tha hook. I think her and Davis should have a story of their own. Though i wasn't too fond on this book, i will continue to read her stories.	2005-04-19
