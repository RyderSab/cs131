This book was recommended to me by a good friend who has struggled with his intimate relationships for some time.  It's pretty good, though it assumes that experiencing love and being happy are the purposes of life.  The sex chapter is unfortunately conventional, but the book illuminates the difference between Real Love (which is unconditional) and Imitation Love (which is based on trading), and outlines the \\"Getting\\" and \\"Protecting\\" Behaviors people use, along with techniques for moving beyond them.  The example situations were idealized and conceptual -- not from real life -- and the author is pretty shamelessly promoting himself as a speaker and workshop leader, but his ideas are sound and also give insight, even for those who already swim in the ocean of unconditional love regularly, on how to deal with people who use the Imitation Love behaviors he describes.<br /><br />It is up to those who experience unconditional love on a regular basis to generate and spread it throughout the world, then we can be in a position to fearlessly examine the larger spiritual issues of existence as well.	2005-07-29

In this one, lonely Victor finds Pinny on the tray of a Peddler Doll and manages to buy her, then they clean up a doll house to live in.  This is a very small, unassuming book as well, but it is charming and heartwarming.	2005-06-17

OK, now right here is a nasty little book on how to set up panhandling and other scams.  It starts with a chapter on how to make $100 a week and ends at $5000 a week in chapter 12, usually capitalizing on one's own physical features, talents, or particular situation.  Omar the Beggar, who runs the panhandling workshops, helps one guy with a stutter dress up with bandages on his head, holding a sign asking people to help pay for the rest of the operation.  (Omar does advise against using a seeing eye dog or a white cane to simulate disability.)  For people with too much conscience, he gets them leading impromptu parades for tips or looking in hotel lounge sofas for spare change and wallets to return for rewards.  Omar has a tough-love tone toward his panhandling workshop clients and manages to deliver all the stories with a straight face.<br /><br />Do not miss Mike's story on page 106.  Mike \\"was the sole support for his sister, a midget, who was seven months pregnant, unmarried and she refused to abort.\\"  Mike can chin himself 100 times and stand on his hands for an hour, so he goes to a high-rise and dangles from a 4th story ledge.  His accomplice Mario runs through the crowd with a bullhorn imploring people to give money so his \\"brother\\" can pay the rent and avoid suicide.  At 10 such stunts weekly in a big city, Omar claims the two guys make $700 a week (when written in 1977).<br /><br />Need I say that this gritty little tome is for entertainment purposes only??  However, it is amusing and rather addictive.  Just remember, most beggars are no more scammers than most welfare mothers are J.K. Rowling (the author of the Harry Potter series).  Just because some people manage to do it, doesn't make it likely.	2005-05-20

A child violin protegy comes to Sleepyside with her mean old aunt to perform as a guest artist with the symphony. (She's so spoiled, Bobby could take Brat Lessons from her.) Meanwhile, the Bob-Whites are putting together a collection of herbs and flowers from nearby Martin's Marsh, where pirate treasure is rumored to be hidden. A mysterious recluse lives at the edge of the marsh, and paths converge, as they are wont to do, the famous child violinist dogging Trixie and Honey's steps with a persistence that reminds one of the Schoolgirl Shamus herself.<br /><br />The author was clearly tiring by the end of the story, and what could have been a dramatic rescue is told almost in summary. But there is mystery and history to be discovered in this book, and its fast pace makes up for this undeveloped scene. It does make the reader aware of how pleasant normal life can be compared with the burdens of fame, especially for child performers.	2005-05-14

The Bob-Whites get a last-minute invitation to spend spring break at the Iowa sheep ranch of Andrew Belden, Trixie's uncle. (Dan can't come -- he has to study -- setting the pattern for the original Bob-Whites to continue on without him. Since the BWGs travel, they get to ditch little brother Bobby too!)<br /><br />Uncle Andrew doesn't believe his \\"pretty, feminine, and sort of helpless\\" niece Trixie can solve the mystery of his missing sheep, so of course she's compelled to try. (Trixie helpless?? Hah!!) She does make some embarrassing mistakes, and the kids deserve the testy scoldings they get from the ranch manager and his wife before they prove their mettle.<br /><br />However, she's occasionally feeling more girly than in previous books; as a guest at a dance at Riverdale High School, she finds herself in the throes of the unfamiliar emotion of jealousy as Jim is wooed by a beautiful senior girl, Dot. This leads Trixie to emulate Di and Honey, flirting with a handsome basketball player, Ned (who I'm guessing will turn out to be gay when he grows up) ... Don't worry, though; Jim prefers the kind of girl who doesn't dress up to impress boys, who is \\"genuine and so comfortable to be around.\\" (Guess who?)<br /><br />And Trixie's \\"near-twin\\" Mart comes through again. I find Mart the underappreciated character of the series; he's mocked and stereotyped for his extensive vocabulary, but often it is his analytical skills and ability to predict what Trixie will do that saves her skin in the most desperate of situations.<br /><br />I didn't remember anything about this book from reading it as a teenager, which rather surprises me, as it is quite exciting, and friendships among the various Bob-Whites are beginning to show signs of potential romance.	2005-05-14

Meanwhile I read the book (in two sittings, which worked out fine).<br /><br /> Three stories alternate chapters:<br /><br />· A man with no sense of humor, who is also an American writer of popular humorous novels, spends two hours one night grieving the end of his latest relationship;<br /><br />· the young Japanese woman who left him now sleeps;<br /><br />· and an anarchistic, cancerous story continues on its own from a page written by the writer, torn into pieces, and thrown into the wastebasket.<br /><br />The third story, of the eponymous sombrero, is of a town that goes berserk after the icy white sombrero falls from a clear sky.  It is purposely a bad story, as it has lost the attention of the writer, just as the writer has lost the attention of the Japanese woman and is now similarly falling apart.  The violent, over-the-top wastebasket story became tedious to me, but the other two stories were lovely and illuminating, in a self-obsessed way.  Perhaps this novel's best time for my life has passed, so happy honeymoon, Rachel!	2005-05-11

This is an interesting set of 4 double-ended chops, once you get over the fact that they are rubber stamps, not \\"carved\\" as both the box and the product description claim.  The rectangular handles may be lacquered wood, but the ends are mass-produced squares of rubber.  They were all designed by the one artist featured in the accompanying book, which shows several more chops that are not included in this set, tells what they mean, and explains how the designs were put together.<br /><br />The little book is OK, not a bad introduction to the history and art of the Chinese chop.  (Not that I know anything about it.)  The book gives confusing, ambiguous written directions for using the chops -- my husband and I disagreed about what the instructions meant, and NEITHER of us was right -- but if you look up the description of each image, you can figure out the orientation to use when you stamp it.<br /><br />Rubber stampers, altered book artists, and mail artists will get a lot of use out of this set, and eraser carvers should find inspiration here as well.  I've been stamping a chop onto the otherwise unadorned envelopes I send out (like bills), and it adds an aura of mystery and exotic places with minimal effort.<br /><br />This set is overpriced, but I expect to get my money's worth out of it over time.	2005-05-07

Books	5	16	19	N	N	A helpful book, whether or not the author is still alive	This wonderful book is not likely to be reprinted, unfortunately, after the death in 2004 of co-author Olivia Goldsmith (which was the writer name of Justine Rendal, born Randy Goldfield), who died of a reaction to anesthesia during cosmetic surgery (a facelift).  That doesn't discount her as a fashion consultant, now, does it?  She changed her name to suit her purposes, and she reassures us that girls who think their bodies are too big can change their style and look great in their clothes -- we've got the power if we've got the nerve! If she also wanted surgery to improve her looks and had the means to afford it, I say go for it, and don't let fear stop you.  Better dead than afraid to go for what you want, and the people who criticize her for it can hole up in their apartments and tell the rest of us what not to do with our lives, eh?<br /><br /> Goldsmith and co-author Amy Fine Collins have written an empowering, witty, and even spiritual book in Simple Isn't Easy, which I got through interlibrary loan.  Much of their advice sounds Zen: you can do more with less, and being a consumer won't fill your internal holes.  I wouldn't have thought it, but I would be happy to pay $25 or $30 for this little paperback on the secondary (used) market.  The strategy for weeding out one's closet is practical, and the concept of finding a personal \\"uniform,\\" whatever it is, lends one a truly distinctive style.  This was one of the better self-help books I've read.  These women hold your hand and walk you through it, and you laugh and roll your eyes at yourself all the way.<br /><br /> This book gets only 3 stars because one of the authors had the audacity to die young, which frightens people ... no, wait, it's still a wonderful book, isn't it??  So how about we give it the FIVE STARS it deserves!	2005-03-11

The authors point to icons like Audrey Hepburn or Marilyn Monroe, who had a lot more going for them than just good fashion (such as great charisma, being photogenic, buckets of money, and the advice of top stylists).

The art doll on the cover quickly gives way to Baby Think It Over dolls (to discourage teen pregnancy) and dolls based on the \\"Elsie Dinsmore\\" books by Martha Finley, which were designed to \\"strengthen Martha Finley's Biblical hold on the development of tomorrow's leaders.\\" There are some interesting chapters devoted to specific doll companies, typically \\"godly\\" ones.

It happens when you take her advice, stop beating yourself up, and take the baby steps in the order she describes (first, clean out your kitchen sink and shine it; don't worry, she tells you exactly HOW to do it too).

Concerned about vandalism at the school, the Sleepyside Junior-Senior High School board threatens to dissolve the Bob-Whites of the Glen and other 'secret societies,' so the kids decide to show how civic-minded they are by holding an antique show as a fundraiser for UNICEF. (Say, how can a school board get away with regulating kids' private activities?! This is America!)<br /><br />This is a satisfying Trixie Belden story (except that the vandalism theme is forgotten after the first chapters) -- where friends and daily activities are more important than the nominal 'mystery.' The 'code' turns out to be nothing much, but 'Trixie Belden and the Antique Show Fundraiser' wouldn't have had much zing, would it? Still, there's plenty of adventure -- somebody seems intent on sabotaging the BWG clubhouse and stealing the loaned antiques! Blizzards! Faithful dogs! Criminals and critical illness! Games and popcorn around the fireplace! And this time when Trixie dresses up for a party, she means it and even enjoys herself.	2004-07-28

This is a Zen book for the beginning Zen practitioner, by which I mean someone who has already decided to try zazen meditation practice and may have been practicing for a few weeks or months.  Note I do not say it is for the Zen scholar or the Zen wannabe, but for the person who plants their rear on the cushion every day and wants to know what to do if their feet are falling asleep or who's noticing background noise in the mind.  If you want to be hip and know &quot;about&quot; Zen, there are flashier books.  But as one who had finally tired of reading cookbooks and hungered for the meal, this book pointed me in the right direction (or, at least, ONE right direction) and helps me actually &quot;cook,&quot; so to speak.<br />Like the saying goes, &quot;Meditation: it's not what you think,&quot; so if you are attracted to Zen but aren't actually sitting zazen, give up the critiquing and dabbling, find a teacher, and get to work.  This book helps both in choosing a teacher and in addressing random questions and common pitfalls for the beginning meditator.	2004-07-11

Marcie has been picked by the weirdest girl in school, Clarissa, to be her very best friend.  Written in 1977, it's dated now, because Clarissa is a Goth foremother, wearing nothing but thrift shop clothing, a true original, reminiscent of Daniel Pinkwater characters such as Rat from the Snarkout books.  Marcie's world is conformist, from friends to parents to school, and Clarissa fares about as well as Stargirl until a secret talent is revealed, and Marcie realizes that there's more to friendship than popularity.	2004-07-11

The resulting book &quot;True Colors&quot; is glorious if a bit worked, and I personally would have enjoyed more straightforward photo documentation.  Much texture in the original works, which doesn't translate well to glossy pages.  Perhaps because the same 15 artists contribute and all are influenced by each other's works, there's an overwrought sameness after a while, though individual pages pop out surprisingly.  A thoughtful final section discusses various techniques.  Altogether a luscious treat; but remember to create and don't compare.	2004-06-29

The third &quot;bookman's&quot; novel finds Cliff Janeway chasing high-end collectibles by the explorer Richard Burton.  But this novel is sadder than the others, with too many losses to feel completely satisfied at the resolution of the various mysteries. However, Dunning's imaginative telling of Burton's missing months in the American South brings the history to life and conveys his own passion for this particular author and adventurer.  I also enjoyed the witty (albeit unrealistic) repartee between the characters.<br />I liked &quot;Booked to Die&quot; the most, and this one is my second choice.  This book also exposes and rails against the unethical bookman and collector.  As in the previous two in the series, accurate book lore is sprinkled throughout, giving a taste of the addictive potential of book collecting.<br />You don't need to spend into 5 figures to enjoy the book collecting fever!  Like  Cliff, educate yourself and then collect what you love (and can afford).	2004-05-22

The good side of the culture, the parts for which we feel nostalgia, can be found in those latter titles, but &quot;Keeper of the Bees&quot; shows the dark side of the same culture.  An unmarried woman risks the good name of herself and her entire family if she gets pregnant, and because of this, the novel has an overbearing message of the sullying effect of premarital relationships.  It sympathizes with women who consider suicide because they (or close relatives) are unmarried and pregnant -- because the child would forever after be considered a &quot;shame baby.&quot;  To hide this shame, otherwise &quot;noble&quot; characters in this novel concoct elaborate lies to mislead others, all because of the supposedly ruinous effect an out-of-wedlock pregnancy would have on both of the parents, as well as the child and the extended family and friends.  The ruin is not just social, by the way, because the relationship puts the souls of mother, father, and child into eternal peril as well.<br />This book also has an unbelievably precocious, androgynous child called &quot;The Scout&quot; as a central figure.  Michael O'Halloran was much more endearing than this overwrought character.<br />The parts about beekeeping and nature were my favorites, but overall I was happy to be done with this dated, unpleasant tale.	2004-05-08

Julie Campbell Tatham, writing as \\"Julie Campbell,\\" wrote the first six books of the series, and this, the fifth, stumbles. The scenes where Trixie tries to convince her family and friends that she's \\"in love\\" to achieve a noble secret agenda, were embarrassing and unnecessary -- she could have achieved the same end by confiding in her parents straightforwardly. And the \\"mystery\\" turns out to be a disappointing non-mystery. I recommend this particular Trixie Belden book mainly to continuity fans who want to know every detail of the development of the Bob-Whites of the Glen club; otherwise, skip to the Mystery in Arizona for a believable and entertaining (rather than ridiculous) story.<br />Even so, I'm delighted that this series is back in print!!  This edition features Mary Stevens' darling illustrations from the 1950s.  (There are Trixie Belden websites on the Internet that talk about the various editions and illustrators.)  The new editions tend to go out of print fairly quickly, so don't assume they'll always be around!	2004-04-17

Nan impulsively buys a purple tooled-leather journal and runs away from home for a couple of weeks, sending daily letters back home to her husband and writing in the journal. Nan, like most of us, sees herself as the beleaguered heroine in her life drama, but as a reader, I could still ruefully identify with the self-indulgence and privilege. As in real life, the protagonist Nan doesn't get off all the good lines, and when she tells off a haircutter, he ends up getting the best of her -- but everyone wins. This is a fine novel for journal writers, people who need a little solitude, for someone on a road trip, and for women who want to find and appreciate the good they have in life.<br /><br />An Amazon.com reader directed me to Berg's short story &quot;Martin's Letter to Nan&quot; from her story collection &quot;Ordinary Life.&quot; While Nan is away, Martin does a little soul searching on his own, and Nan may be surprised to find out that what Martin wants is a room where he can smoke his cigars in the house. His &quot;voice&quot; is not that differentiated from Nan's, but it's fun to find out how the author imagined the long-suffering husband might react.	2004-04-09

Here's an application for physically active rubber stampers that was completely unknown to me until I picked up this book on a library display shelf.  Letterboxing is in the same family of hobbies as geocaching, where enthusiasts use their GPS (global positioning systems) to track down treasures hidden by other enthusiasts somewhere in the countryside.  Letterboxing is geocaching's Luddite cousin, as all you need is the clues and a compass.  You might go to a letterboxing website, find out about letterboxes hidden in your area, read the clues, and take off on an entertaining day hike with a &quot;pot of gold&quot; at the end.  When you find the treasure, which can consist of a logbook and a rubber stamp in a small Tupperware container &quot;under the rock at the end of the fence,&quot; for example, you stamp your own signature stamp in the letterbox's logbook, stamp the letterbox's rubber stamp into your own logbook, then replace everything exactly for the next treasure seeker.<br />The author has done a great job of introducing this fast-growing sport, which is new to the U.S. in the past decade or so.  The instructions on using a compass and triangulating kind of threw me, so if I go off on a letterboxing hike, I'll need someone who knows how to use a compass to go with me and explain it.<br />But otherwise, the book is a quick read, tells how to get started, how to carve your signature stamp, letterboxing etiquette, and answers frequently asked questions while assiduously avoiding spoilers or giving away too much.  There's plenty here, including web resources, to arouse curiosity and interest in the activity, one about which I myself knew absolutely nothing before picking up this charming book.  Really a good job for the first U.S. book on the subject.	2004-03-14

Jeffrey Hopkins, who spent 10 years as chief interpreter to the Dalai Lama, spills the beans in this helpful introductory guide to Tibetan Buddhism.  'Compassion,' he says, 'is the heartfelt wish that sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.'  That means all sentient beings -- one's friends, one's enemies, and those neutral people one passes daily without really even noticing.  The book outlines a series of meditations for developing compassion and equanimity, but even if you have a different meditation practice and merely read through the meditations, the book is wise, generous, and helpful.  The introductory chapter on the mechanics of meditation alone was very valuable, giving instruction not only on how to sit, but also on the weird little questions like how to hold the head and teeth, and what to do with the eyes and breath.  This book will be a blessing to you no matter what tradition you follow.  When you begin to cherish everyone and sincerely wish that they be free from suffering, you are finding the heart of compassion.<br />P.S.  &quot;Joy is the opposite of jealousy.&quot;	2004-03-07

We get to know ourselves through our failures as well as our successes, and these learning experiences can be honored rather than avoided with shame.  Chapters cover the failure of love, happiness, success, philosophy, plans, security, meaning, enlightenment, ego, God, and death, and even the &quot;failure&quot; of failure if one doesn't fail &quot;consciously&quot; and productively incorporate the lessons of unsatisfactory experiences.  These experiences, the author believes, throw you back on yourself and God (or Truth).<br />David Whyte's essays cover much of the same ground more thoughtfully and elegantly (see &quot;The Heart Aroused,&quot; for example).  &quot;The Way of Failure&quot; is fairly repetitive and one-note in comparison, but the idea that we will all fail along the way and that we can make use of it is a good one to remember in our consumerist, ego-driven society.	2004-02-21

The author rightly believes that adult children have every right to choose lifestyles that their parents might find weird -- living in a commune, not having children, coming out as gay, or following a guru, for example.  But in advocating for that right, she promotes a heavy-handed moral certitude that pretty much advises the parents to just get over it.<br />If a parent or relative has already determined to accept the alternative lifestyle and wants support in dealing with it, this would be a good book.  It's not great on confronting the reasons behind the parental disapproval, such as upbringing or religion, and gives no help whatsoever to a parent who goes against her church or community in accepting a particular lifestyle.  Caplan just suggests that love for the adult child must overcome the differences and that the parent needs to work on himself, though there are some helpful guidelines for \\"agreeing to disagree\\" on some subjects and then letting the topic drop.<br />Caplan doesn't like the word \\"cult\\" and suggests using \\"alternative lifestyle\\" instead.  She conveniently discusses what she seems to consider the \\"healthy\\" lifestyle differences such as vegetarianism, but notably absent are \\"lifestyle choices\\" such as drugs, crime, and sexual misconduct.  (Not all parental disapproval is due to outmoded cultural conditioning.)  The book is also silent on drawing limits with adult children who take advantage of their parents emotionally or financially, assuming that the fault is all on the part of rigid, controlling parents.<br />The book is presented under the authority of an M.A. without giving any biographical information on the author's credentials.  It will appeal primarily to adult children who want to give it as a gift to help their parents change.  But their parents are going to want to turn around and give back some books written by their own \\"authorities,\\" so I advise against giving this book to your parents without acknowledging the author's assumptions first (i.e., \\"I'm right and my parents are wrong\\").e against giving this book to your parents without acknowledging the author's assumptions first (i.e., \\"I'm right and my parents are wrong\\").	2004-02-18

When I finished the book, after mulling for a few minutes, I went back and skimmed over the first chapters again (which had been unnecessarily confusing on first read).  I recommend that the reader start a list of the Plumb family and of George's circle of friends, and note each character's identifying details.  I did so and found myself referring to my list frequently as I read the book.<br />As a husband, friend, and father, George Plumb had a very deep influence on the people around him.  Like all of us, he wanted all the influence to be for the good, and it wasn't.  But Maurice Gee brilliantly illuminates George Plumb in ways Plumb doesn't know are being revealed as he tells his own story, and the reader ends with sympathy for this contradictory, rigid, yet highly moral man, one who, despite his expectations and judgments on everyone around him, knew both Illumination and Love, and the reader can be happy he found them.  When one looks at any character from the inside, it all makes sense, and one can feel compassion and recognition even for such an outwardly difficult character such as George Plumb.<br />By the way, Plumb is a Presbyterian minister (not Methodist, as a previous reviewer said).  His spiritual/political journey forms a key theme of the book.  (George thinks it is THE theme, but the reader knows better.)	2004-02-05

I saw it at the library and idly opened it to read a few paragraphs.  After standing there and reading 20 pages from the middle, I checked it out, went to a cafe, started back at the beginning, and read it straight through until I was done.  I was drinking decaf coffee, but at times I was so on edge from this suspenseful novel, my heart racing, that I thought I must have been slipped espresso instead!<br />Be wary of reading the reviews of his book, because in many ways it is a psychological mystery -- WHY do people do what they do,  and what were they protecting and hiding? -- and hearing too much about it will lessen the impact of the novel itself.  You will probably appreciate these reviews more AFTER you've read the book, in any case.<br />Jenna, the 14-going-on-25-year-old girl, cusses a lot; that and the intense plot make this a book for older teens who can handle an edgy book with adult themes.  I suggest that parents read this along with their teen so they can discuss the myriad of social problems this book addresses so skillfully.<br />OK, so now you've read the book and want to hear some discussion ...<br />Jenna and her sensitive 12-year-old brother Jeremy are wonderfully drawn characters, as are the supporting characters.  The most puzzling character to me was the boyfriend Gregory, who seems too insightful at first to become such a loser later.  However, he has a lot in common with another of the characters, in that he uses his charm to get his own needs met without being able to really connect emotionally with others.<br />People are realistic, in that they aren't \\"predictable\\" stereotypes, but fully realized individuals.  Jenna and Jeremy take turns narrating, but the reader doesn't think they're each \\"writing\\" their story; you're just getting into their heads.  Their disbelief, horror, numbness, and heightened sensitivity compete with confusing, conflicting thoughts and emotions.  Despite each of their flaws, brother and sister are quite close to each other, which is refreshing.  In reconstructing the events leading up to the murder, the kids get to know their parents as full yet equally flawed human beings -- knowledge that comes at a high price.<br />Mainly this is about the slow unraveling of family secrets, and how sometimes an irreversible tragedy forces a family to admit its problems.  Altogether this is a very compelling book for more mature teens and adults who like a very well written, timely, and believable young adult novel., brother and sister are quite close to each other, which is refreshing.

Most of the recipes here call for items far beyond what I was hoping to see, such as beading wire and wire cutters, clay or paperclay, molds, cornstarch, and cheesecloth.  You get to make dreamcatchers and modeled papier-mache dolls, but only half a dozen of the nearly 30 projects appealed to me as actual &quot;paper dolls.&quot;  The others have an advanced &quot;Way of the Doll&quot; feeling, but for the money, I'd rather buy several Dover paper doll books and create my own projects.  This book gives instructions for re-creating specific art dolls but is intimidating rather than encouraging of individual creativity (even specifically disallowing commercial sale of the projects described within, because they are NOT &quot;jumping-off&quot; ideas, but copyrighted finished products). And though the author is trying to expand the definition of &quot;paper doll,&quot; even an elastic word or phrase can be stretched past the breaking point, as has happened here.<br />However, the doll projects are both photographed and, inexplicably, illustrated in drawings.  The drawings could be photocopied and cut out to make interesting (and quick!) paper dolls.	2003-09-23

Laura Blundy is a mysterious Victorian-era London woman in this novel that is part period piece, part psychological thriller.  The language is beautiful, reminiscent of Virginia Woolf, and the narrator unreliable yet fascinating, both to her acquaintances and to me as the reader. As a period piece, the novel shows a city with extremes of wealth and poverty, and everyone does whatever they need to get by, trading what they can offer for what they need.<br />But the lasting strength of the novel lies in its masterful depiction of a narrator whom the reader comes to understand with much more clarity than Laura has toward herself.  For a gripping read, this one can't be beat.  I probably would have given it only four stars when I first finished it, but now I consider it a five-star novel due to the lingering reverberations and the many times I've thought of it since reading it.	2003-09-18

A mysterious recluse lives at the edge of the marsh, and paths converge, as they are wont to do, the famous child violinist dogging Trixie and Honey's steps with a persistence that reminds one of the Schoolgirl Shamus herself.<br />The author was clearly tiring by the end of the story, and what could have been a dramatic rescue is told almost in summary.  But there is mystery and history to be discovered in this book, and its fast pace makes up for this undeveloped scene.  It does make the reader aware of how pleasant normal life can be compared with the burdens of fame, especially for child performers.	2003-09-05

(For a discussion of the various illustrators, editions, and authors, check out some of the Trixie Belden websites, such as trixie-belden or the trixie belden home page.)<br />This book climaxes with one of my two favorite scenes from the entire series (the other being in the Mystery of the Blinking Eye).

(Trixie helpless?? Hah!!) She does make some embarrassing mistakes, and the kids deserve the testy scoldings they get from the ranch manager and his wife before they prove their mettle.<br />However, she's occasionally feeling more girly than in previous books; as a guest at a dance at Riverdale High School, she finds herself in the throes of the unfamiliar emotion of jealousy as Jim is wooed by a beautiful senior girl, Dot.  This leads Trixie to emulate Di and Honey, flirting with a handsome basketball player, Ned (who I'm guessing will turn out to be gay when he grows up) ... Don't worry, though; Jim prefers the kind of girl who doesn't dress up to impress boys, who is \\"genuine and so comfortable to be around.\\"  (Guess who?)<br />And Trixie's \\"near-twin\\" Mart comes through again.  I find Mart the underappreciated character of the series; he's mocked and stereotyped for his extensive vocabulary, but often it is his analytical skills and ability to predict what Trixie will do that saves her skin in the most desperate of situations.<br />I didn't remember anything about this book from reading it as a teenager, which rather surprises me, as it is quite exciting, and friendships among the various Bob-Whites are beginning to show signs of potential romance.	2003-08-29

Trixie Belden and Honey Wheeler find a diamond in the abandoned gatehouse at the edge of the Wheelers' property, but someone is trying to get it back. Meanwhile, Trixie's brothers Brian and Mart have returned from camp, meeting Honey and her brother Jim for the first time, so the secret Bob-Whites of the Glen club is ripe for formation.<br />As much trouble as the girls get into, the adults still come off as helpful and intelligent, unlike many other YA mystery series (or even the Harry Potter books).<br />Usually I prefer the Deluxe edition from the 1960s with covers illustrated by Paul Frame, but for this one, check out the edition illustrated by Mary Stevens. One picture shows Trixie and Honey doing some pruning -- with Trixie looking remarkably like Beavis of MTV fame -- and a charming Ashley Judd look-alike picture of Trixie greeting Mart. This book also features the memorable line by Regan, the Wheeler's beloved young groom, \\"Reach for the ceiling, Laughing-Boy.\\"	2003-08-28

Dear Sandra,<br />Thanks for lending me Fodor's How to Pack book!  Having never been abroad before, I had a lot to learn and didn't even know it.  I'm going to have to get a copy of this book for myself, especially for the checklists of &quot;Basic Wardrobe Options for Women,&quot; ditto for men, and what to put into a first aid kit, laundry kit, sewing kit, toiletries kit, etc.  I read the sections on packing for cruises, mountain trips, hot and cold weather, and adventure trips even though I wasn't going to use them for this vacation, just because they were interesting and I kept picking up the stray tip.  (Thank goodness I don't have to use their advice on traveling with children!)<br />The sections on what to wear on the plane, what to pack in one's carry-on (as well as reminders of what NOT to pack), food for the journey, and how to pack luggage that will be checked in were extremely useful.  Who would have thought to pack clothes in those plastic bags from dry cleaners to keep items from wrinkling??  I'm trying it and will let you know how it works out.  They also talk about the different philosophies of packing -- the &quot;roll&quot; style that is especially good for duffel bags, vs. the &quot;interlock&quot; style where you stack layers and then fold them all together to decrease wrinkling.<br />On the down side, the book seemed padded and too chatty, when, being the procrastinator that I am, I needed to get the information right away.  But I was able to find it, and someone could just use the many helpful checklists and be way ahead of the game, as I was.  And there were things I never thought about, such as compiling a &quot;personal documents&quot; file to put in my carry-on, with a copy of my passport and driver's license and a photo of my luggage in case it got lost.<br />Altogether I found this a must-read for either the procrastinator or the unseasoned traveler such as yours truly.  Thanks for caring enough to send me this book!<br />Best wishes,<br />-Hs,<BR>-H	2003-05-24

This is such a lovely read, I enjoyed it thoroughly and always looked forward to getting back to it.  Schiwy has a psychoanalytic approach and an accessible writing style that bond together beautifully.  She mixes techniques, encouragement, and deep thinking about why and how women can keep journals.  The excerpts from various journals merge seamlessly with her own text, and I am now enjoying researching some of the journals to which she has introduced me.  An appendix gives a long list of journal-writing topics, corresponding to the chapter themes, and the endnotes and bibliography are similarly extensive.<br />Schiwy demonstrates such respect and love for the women's journals into which she has either peeked or delved, she sidesteps the voyeuristic aspect of reading someone else's most private words.  Perhaps to narrow her theme, Schiwy focuses on women's journals, but using a journal to break free of patriarchic strangleholds is not limited to women only, and I found some of the feminism to come dangerously near to male-bashing, so gents, approach with caution.  Some of these journals are from famous women; some are the you and me of the secret society of diarists.  Still, women's journals should not be of interest only to women, so gents, take the plunge along with us!  This is both a practical and a theoretical handbook, one of the best overviews of journal writing I've had the pleasure to read.	2003-05-23

She loves the extended metaphor and gives lots of suggestions for writing fancy.  Tom Robbins can take metaphors to ridiculous heights (or depths), so read one of his novels and you'll get an idea of how to do it, and maybe why not to.<br />This emphasis on learning style over content made me as frustrated as a two-year-old playing with his big brother's Tonka truck fire engine but not being able to figure out how to raise the ladder because there's a little catch he needed to release, but if his mom hears him crying and brings over two soft chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk in his favorite little Winnie the Pooh cup, he feels better -- hey, people this kind of exercise isn't why I write a journal.<br />However, there are redeeming elements.  The author has excerpted several interesting journals from successful writers, and their passages provide a peek into the creative mind, though the \\"exercises\\" following each one tend to reduce them to formulas.  She'll take Pam Houston's letters -- which pop out as long, fully formed essays, rather intimidating if one doesn't write that way oneself -- and asks you to copy the format, then \\"when you feel finished, try for an ending like Houston's where she lists details and images from her Texas trip, saying in each moment that she sees her love for her correspondee.  What images and details will you list?  How do you see your love in them?\\"  She doesn't say at the end, \\"Now compare your writing to Houston's, which you read before you wrote your own entries, and feel like an utter failure.\\"<br />As writing instruction, this book falls in the river and drowns.  As a collection of themed essays by good writers in journal format, it's slim but worthy.	2003-05-08

In their menacing new neighborhood they have to deal with mean kids and criminals, but Archie distracts Oggie as much as he can by telling him a fantastic story of the Mysterious Mole People, who live underground and mercilessly try to right the wrongs of the above-world.<br />Things turn even more scary when Archie tries to get Oggie's stolen wallet back from a neighborhood gang, but the brothers count on each other and have inventive ways of coping with their situations.  This YA novel was dark for my tastes, but people do live this way and the two boys' ability to adjust and grow stronger will reassure and encourage a lot of kids.<br />Writers of all ages will enjoy Archie's perceptive observations on writing.

I've kept diaries, notebooks, and journals for 30 years, and for fun and new ideas I like to read books about writing and journaling.  This was the most boring book on journaling I have read yet.  It makes journaling sound like a chore or school assignment.<br />This book did not make me want to put it down and do my own writing, which is one of the things I look for in books on writing.  It made me want to lie down on the couch and sleep.  The author includes NO actual diary entries, either her own or other people's, and she goes on repetitively about the benefits of keeping a journal, as if trying to resell the idea, chapter after chapter.  She also overstates both the need to schedule one's writing and the pleasures of writing for new journalers.  I don't write every day unless I feel like it; never have.  And I don't set aside one special pen for writing -- how limited!  Although she gives lists of types of journals one can keep, they are obvious and lifeless, with almost no discussion of visual (non-word) ways of journaling.  Sad to say, I got only about 1/3 of the way through this book before giving up, skimming each chapter, and just reading the box at the end of each chapter, &quot;The Least You Need to Know.&quot;<br />There is so much more potential energy and enjoyment in journaling than this book conveys.  Fortunately, many other books do cover this ground vibrantly; find one of them instead.<br />But most importantly, just get yourself a nice blank book, a comfortable pen, and START.  Write when you feel like it, when you have time, and when you feel a burning issue or a lack of clarity.  Read other people's published journals and get inspired.  And don't destroy your journals (especially if you're young); find a good hiding place, treat them lovingly, and they will reward you with insight into your own patterns and a treasury of memories to which you can return again and again.	2003-04-25

In reading \\"Profound Healing\\" 15 years later, I finally reached for a highlighter again, because I knew that a) I would be keeping this book for a long time, and b) after I finished gobbling up the \\"plot,\\" I would want to return to important passages and remind myself of exercises and references.  So even if you're like me and using a highlighter on a book is a form of heresy, keep one handy when you're reading \\"Profound Healing.\\"  (I showed the book to my older sister, another book lover like myself, and she pretended to grow faint and need smelling salts when she saw the highlighting!)<br />This book tells the inspiring story of the author, whom I have met, and her journey from cancer, to an acceptance of and preparation for death, to physical healing.  In Part One, she tells of discovering that she had advanced cervical cancer and how she decided to treat it (and NOT with the radical surgery recommended by her doctors).  She refers to earlier spiritual training, but fear not! in Part Two she tells that story and introduces us to her spiritual teacher and her own inner (and outer) journeys.  Part Three is the post-cancer adjustment period, and Part Four outlines the 12 Steps she identifies for the healing process.<br />Canfield writes, \\"Profound healing is not a cessation of physical symptoms, but an expanded awareness of our spiritual nature.\\"  She does not \\"blame the victim\\" or offer miracle cures for relieving symptoms, but rather points us to a deeper, more numinous realm.  Having met Cheryl in person, I can attest that she is an unassuming and humble person and is not caught up in trying to convince people of anything their own intuition doesn't corroborate.<br />I am a skeptic.  I haven't experienced the mystical things Canfield and other spiritual writers say they have experienced.  But I don't discount their experiences.  Who knows, maybe I'm the woman with her eyes closed who just hasn't seen the sunrise yet -- it doesn't mean that sunrises aren't \\"real.\\"  Fortunately for the skeptics among us, Canfield does not ask us to believe what she believes.

If you've heard of delectable cookbooks being referred to as \\"food porn,\\" you'll understand why I might refer to the first four chapters of The Art of the Handwritten Note as \\"stationery porn.\\"  Shepherd describes beautifully why and how to handwrite a variety of notes and letters.  I've written hundreds myself and can vouch for the soundness of her advice.  And I love reading different authors on the beauties of pens and papers, as I am one of those addicts.<br /> However, in Chapter Five, \\"Opportunities to Write the Note That Counts,\\" she goes seriously astray in discussing the etiquette of letter writing.  She presents her own preferences as etiquette rules, when they certainly aren't.  For instance, one does not need to write thank-you letters when gifts are exchanged in person, though it is a nice touch.  And one sample shows a thank-you letter for a baby shower gift signed by  - ugh! - the baby.  The text contradicts this sample letter, saying \\"You write these as the parent, acknowledging your gratitude for gifts given to your children, until the children learn to write for themselves,\\" but the lack of captions for the sample letters makes one wonder if this was supposed to be an example of misguided cuteness.  But then she says you can phone or email these thanks instead.  No, no, no!<br /> And a \\"printed card in the mail or an announcement in the newspaper\\" to respond to condolence notes?  Hardly!  She even allows \\"frank\\" responses to gifts one doesn't like, suggesting that you may ask the giver to exchange it for you - WHAT IS SHE THINKING??<br /> \\"Dear Lytton, I already own the volume of Miss Eden's letters which you so kindly sent, but perhaps you could exchange it for a copy of `The Princesse de Cl&eacute;ves,' which I do not yet have.

In the phrases to use and avoid in fan letters, for example, she sagely advises the letter writer to say, \\"I have every one of your books,\\" but don't say, \\"I bought your book for a dollar from a store that sells rejects.\\"<br /> This could have stayed a five-star book if the author had researched the etiquette of correspondence.

They're clear, so you can move the template around on your paper until you get a pleasing design, then trace around it, cut, fold, glue the flaps, and voila!  The author tells how to incorporate photos, make lined envelopes, and even invites you to adjust the template to make custom-sized envelopes.  This is a quick-gratification craft for adults, as well as for kids who are old enough to use scissors, and it encourages all of us to send more letters and cards.	2003-03-26

I had high hopes for this book, but instead of inspiring my OWN  creativity and soul journey, I found the book filled with patterns and detailed instructions for making the AUTHOR'S soul dolls.  It just ain't the same unless they're your own!  I appreciated the paper doll pattern and fabric clothing, but I don't knit or own a sewing machine, so I was left just admiring the author's talents.  Very detailed instructions - 14 steps to make a tassel doll, for example, with pipe-cleaner type hands - but the pages of numbered steps were rather numbing.  I was also annoyed that every doll had \\"Soul Mate\\" in its name:  Pocket Soul Mate Dolls, Skater Soul Mate Doll, Forgiveness Fairy Soul Mate Doll.  (Name reinforcement can go too far.)  Although it didn't work for me, this could be a great book for someone already comfortable with sewing, knitting, and weaving doll clothes.  And I did enjoy some of the author's other art-therapy techniques, such as starting a Coloring Pages journal and using big fat crayons to \\"take a holiday from words.\\"	2003-03-26

They are soft-sculpture Americana characters from the 1800s; patterns for each doll's clothing are included.  I did not try to make any of the dolls from this 1983 book, but the instructions look comprehensive and the book is lavishly photo illustrated.  The best part is the whimsical full-page biography of each quirky doll.  Somebody had a good time writing this \\"family's\\" story and it reads like an author's background notes for a comic historical novel.	2003-03-25

Cotton doesn't say when he first read Jack Kerouac, but the influence is palpable (though Cotton is no Kerouac) in the protagonist's need for adventure, occasionally Whitmanesque writing style, and the self-observation that makes autobiographical writing possible.  Chronicling his own perceptions as well as stories of the characters he meets, Cotton loves, suffers, triumphs, and continues to grow while on the road, but I lost interest about halfway into it and finished the book in one fast flip-through.<br />The Glossary, however, is an astonishing feat of hobo and tramp lingo and lore.  I read the entire 30-page Glossary before beginning the book proper, and I was so glad I did.  Not only did it make the story more comprehensible, it was also the most rewarding and informative part of the book.	2002-09-19

Who can Uncle Monty ever find to tidy the guest rooms, wash the mountains of dishes, and serve the dinners?  Hmmmm ... On top of it all, Trixie has to bring her grades up before the midyear exams, so Brian and Jim tutor our distracted heroine.  But throw in in the secrets of some unhappy guests and add the cook's little son Petey, who inexplicably wants to run away to join his Granddaddy in a surreal \\"cavelike place,\\" and Trixie is in her sleuthing element.  The book also slides in lots of Arizona and Mexican history and customs, so it gets points for being educational too!	2002-09-19

It all begins here!  Rereading the series 25+ years later, I was pleasantly surprised to find that every chapter doesn't end in an exclamation point and that the relationships among the friends and families are still so rewarding.  Worth reading-or rereading!  (Visit the Trixie Belden Library website for discussions of the various series editions, illustrators, and authors.)<br />The different illustrations slant the series greatly.  I usually prefer the illustrations in the Deluxe (or Tall) editions, as Trixie and Honey look more like modern-day 13-year-olds than they do in the earlier, Glossy editions, where they look very young and outdated.  Still, I like any illustrated edition better than the later text-only editions of the 70s and 80s, but read whatever you can get your hands on!	2002-08-31

Meanwhile, Trixie's brothers Brian and Mart have returned from camp, meeting Honey and her brother Jim for the first time, so the secret Bob-Whites of the Glen club is ripe for formation.<br />As much trouble as the girls get into, the adults still come off as helpful and intelligent, unlike many other YA mystery series (or even the Harry Potter books).<br />Usually I prefer the Deluxe edition with covers illustrated by Paul Frame, but for this one, check out the Glossy edition illustrated by Mary Stevens. One picture shows Trixie and Honey doing some pruning -- with Trixie looking remarkably like Beavis of MTV fame -- and a charming Ashley Judd look-alike picture of Trixie greeting Mart.

This is the one that introduces Diana Lynch to the Bob-Whites club, as she despairs of her recently arrived obnoxious uncle.  Di doesn't bring much but bubbleheadedness to the party, but she does make Trixie look like a rocket scientist in comparison.  And we get to see some of Trixie's snarky side as she makes sarcastic comments to Di on the school bus at the beginning of the book (but Trixie does come around later, thanks to Honey's gentling influence).<br />Note especially the ominous picture in the Deluxe edition (illustrated by Marvin Besunder) of Trixie alone on a field investigation to a seedy neighborhood.  (For a discussion of the various illustrators, editions, and authors, check out the Trixie Belden Library website.)<br />This book climaxes with one of my two most memorable moments from the entire series (the other being in the Mystery of the Blinking Eye).  Let's just say that it can be advantageous to stay on good terms with one's occasionally annoying siblings.	2002-08-31

But his father wants him to enter the plumbing business, and even with his mother's support, Paulie can't keep his grades up enough to get permission to pursue his music.

Author Roxane Orgill picked a single woman to epitomize each decade of the 20th century, profiling women of different genres, each of whom has an interesting story and voice.  Shout, Sister, Shout! is a great introduction to the performers and leaves one wanting to read more about each one of them, while artfully giving a sense of the developments of the 20th century.  I read this fascinating, photographically illustrated book in two sittings and was sorry when it was over.<br />For the 1950s we get, not all-American girl Doris Day, but jazz singer and junkie Anita O'Day, and Orgill chooses outrageous Bette Midler for the 70s instead of Linda Rondstadt, for instance.  Her choice for the 1990s was the most difficult [&quot;How was I to know which of the top performers (of the 1990s) would still be considered exceptional ten, twenty, thirty years from now?&quot;]; with keen insight, the author finally picked alt-country singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams, though she includes long sidebars about Wynonna Judd and LeAnn Rimes as well.<br />Additional sidebars describe advances in music technology and each performer's fashions, and Orgill sneaks in advancements in women's and civil rights, without whitewashing each woman's difficulties, triumphs, love affairs, and addictions.  Two of `em - Anita O'Day and Ethel Merman - never learned to cook, and O'Day didn't clean, either.  (You go, girls!)  Incidentally, O'Day chose her stage last name because, she said, \\"In pig Latin it meant `dough,' which was what I hoped to make.\\"<br />Make sure the music-loving young women in your life see this book, and if you're a grrrl of ANY age or gender, you're sure to enjoy it yourself.	2001-08-22

This is a great book for enjoying 60's and early 70's fashions and for training the eye to find scores in vintage clothing shops and maybe even thrift stores.<br />The main problem with this book is that it is incorrectly billed as a collector's book &quot;with values,&quot; but the values are only half a page of general ranges for various items.  Though that part is misleading, the book overall is flashy and fun and definitely worthwhile.<br />It is also a good basic introduction to fashion terms and the histories of various styles.  The San Francisco photography puts you right in the middle of the 60s, and though some of the styles are ... well ... atrocious, there are many styles that can be modified for today's wearing without having to go for the all-out retro look.

This book is like a poorly run rummage sale or overpriced thrift store -- dig around and you might find a gem or two, but overall it isn't worth the effort.<br />  It might be good for people who have never dared to set food in a thrift store or garage sale, but for anyone with a modicum of thrifting experience (and who else is going to be reading this?), the information is far too general and obvious.<br />  In trying to be fair, the author can't make up his mind whether, for example, you should or should not buy treasures (and they're always &quot;treasures&quot;) you don't need, giving arguments for and against in different sections.  What can you do with a guy who thinks you should definitely buy wire hangers (&quot;It's always good to have extra hangers on hand and, sometimes, plastic-coated hangers just won't work&quot;) and yarn (&quot;Consider buying a box of bargain yarn to have on hand for friends who knit or crochet while they are recovering from an illness&quot;) but doesn't understand vinyl (&quot;Quantities of records are disappearing from secondhand marketplaces, but I'm not sure who is buying them.  Antiques dealers don't seem interested,&quot;) and insists, &quot;Every household should have a Cabbage Patch doll ... Keep the dolls in mind as gift ideas.&quot;<br />  However, if you want reinforcement to help recruit a friend who has never thrifted, this is a friendly and folksy book that does make it seem fun, and the author certainly speaks from experience ... oh, never mind, go straight to Al Hoff's info-packed, fun, and campy book &quot;Thrift Score: The Stuff, the Method, the Madness!&quot; instead.	2001-07-12

The author was described by the Independent on Sunday (London) as \\"one of the forty world figures whose iseas are likely to have a lasting relevance to the new millennium,\\" and is a member of the BBC Brains Trust, the British Academy, and the European Academy.  So what's the problem?  Maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it, but this book seemed insubstantial to me.  \\"We need a new conversation,\\" Zeldin repeats, new ways of talking with each other within and about work, love, technology, family, but the proposals and examples never come.  He's studied conversation, and had innumerable conversations with people all over the world, but how would one characterize these as \\"new\\" or \\"old\\"?  Unfortunately, the book does not live up to the promise of its subtitle.<br /> The final chapter, \\"How Conversation Encourages the Meeting of Minds,\\" on providing hospitality to strangers to enrich the family dialogue, and the 36 conversational topics at the end, were the most practical of the book.  But a book I had looked forward to giving as a gift fell short of my hopes for stimulating thought and community through conversation.	2001-05-22

One of my favorite cards, the 4 of Air, shows a young, waifish nude woman in untied work boots, holding a yellow parasol, suspended as if on a swing on a curl of movie film, looking skyward into an early yellow morning.
