The author relates his tales of research as if they were scenes from a James Bond film.  Also, the DNA research shows that Neanderthals are not directly genetically related to Homo Sapien Sapien.  The book, however, is entertaining reading for themost part...  It bogs down a little near the end but can be muddled through.  All-in-all a good read.	2002-11-27

When I first thought about writing a review for &quot;The Poet&quot;, I wasn't really certain if I liked it that much or not.  So, I skimmed through it again and decided on a Four Star rating.  The premise is quite good....Introducing a new protagonist is difficult for an established writer like Connelly.  This protagonist is a guy with whom you can identify and yet can't quite figure out.  The cast of characters is a little thick but if you pay attention, you can sort it all out.  There are a few stumbling blocks...areas that are just a bit too implausible, even for a Super-Killer like our &quot;Poet&quot; but all in all the story flows nicely from one point to the next.  The twist of the plot is pretty creative and only fades a little in the telling.  I think that the only thing &quot;The Poet&quot; lacks is one more editing session to really smooth out the plot and story line.  It is a worthwhile read, something to take on a plane and plan to read both going and coming.	2002-02-09

Rarely does a work of Nonfiction carry with it all the key ingredients of a great Thriller.  It happened with &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; by Robert Preston and that rare phenomenon has again occurred within the pages of &quot;GERMS: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War.&quot;  I must admit, I really enjoyed this book immensely. <br /><br />&quot;Germs&quot; give the reader the background and history of the United States &quot;Biological Weapons Program&quot; (an oxymoron to be sure) and then, with that foundation, the reader is blasted into a world of stupidity, denial, politics and ineptness.  In fact, (gasp, gag), when the final page is turned, the reader may even find himself or herself having an inkling of admiration for (choke, cough) former President William Jefferson Clinton!!<br /><br />When I finish reading, I wondered how it was that this Great country of ours has survived for its short but productive time of 200+ years.  And oh, I even have a stash of antibiotics set aside now...just in case our luck doesn't continue.  Even with the events of September 11, 2001, the tightening of security that followed, the awareness of Our vulnerability is only now beginning to dawn on &quot;We, the People.&quot; The incredible ability of some group or even &lt;b&gt;one deranged person&lt;/b&gt; to cripple and perhaps destroy this country (or any other for that matter) with just a little dash of this and that is mind boggling!!<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;PROOF THAT SOMETIMES REALITY IS REALLY MUCH SCARIER THAN FICTION!!

I have no idea why I subscribed to this magazine but I have been receiving it for 3 years now and simply cannot bring myself to cancel the subscription.  I am not Jewish nor am I a Jewish sympathizer.  I am a simple Anglo Protestant unmarried female.  The viewpoint of 'The Jerusalem Report' seems to me to be relatively moderate, or at least as &quot;moderate&quot; as things can be in that part of the world.  But everything in that part of the world is so &quot;unmoderate&quot; compared to everything in the United States.  Since September 11, perhaps we Americans have altered our viewpoint a little, but probably VERY little in reality.  The issue that initially dealt with the terrorist events of September 11 mainly seemed to say Hey, this is what we have been telling you, but we live this every day.  I cannot image living that terror every day.  I read the columns and the stories, and reread them, and still I don't understand.  But I keep reading.  How else can I learn.	2001-12-01

But, as I muddled through the first chapters, overlooked some problems in writing style and story line, I actually started to care about the characters and grew intrigued about the storyline.  Borchardt tells a beautifully descriptive tale and it did get better as pages turned.  I recommend this first segment in the series if only as an introduction to the second book, which is really much better.

I had graduated from High School the previous year and college was proving too boring.  So I read.  And read.  And read.  <br />Three of the four stories in this collection are absolutely some of King's best writing ever.  The last story, &quot;The Breathing Method&quot;, is not one of my favorites.  In fact, I don't like it at all but am quite thankful that it is the shortest of the tales.  The other three stories make up for everything (AND MORE) that is lacking in this &quot;Winter's Tale&quot;.<br />The first story is &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.&quot;  It is not true horror (ala King) but rather is the story of determination and the will to live.  This story (and one to follow) is perhaps the best story King ever got adapted to the &quot;Big Screen&quot;.  It is compelling, thoughtful and has a deeper meaning than just escaping from prison.  Andy Dufresne is 'Every Man's Man&quot;...a true survivor and conqueror.<br />The second story, &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, is in my opinion the most disturbing King story ever published (a close second is 'Misery').  Those of us who are &quot;Baby Boomers&quot; remember clearly our parents and grand parents talking about WWII, the Nazis and the horrible things that were done in the Prison Camps.  This story brings to the forefront of our minds how closely related &quot;horrorable&quot; and &quot;thrilling&quot; really are, sort of like the thin line between Love and Hate.  Insanity comes when that line between being repelled by the thing of horror is replaced by an obsessive need to have that which &quot;bad&quot;.<br />And then there is &quot;The Body&quot;.  I don't think this is as good of a story as &quot;The Long Walk&quot; (written as Richard Bachman) but it certainly is an interesting look at &quot;Boyhood&quot;.  This story was also adapted for the &quot;Big Screen&quot; as a quality product and perhaps the screenplay was even betterthan the novella.  Regardless, &quot;The Body&quot; once again brings to the surface hidden fears, and desires, that all of us have experienced both in our youth, and now in our maturity.<br />For me, Stephen King has not necessarily improved with &quot;age&quot;.  But at least three of these stories will always be on my top 50 list for short Novellas.  As an aside, I think that Stephen King has made the Novella an acceptible genre for writers...his latest effort, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, shows how a writer can interelate the Novella into a larger and more encompassing &quot;Opus&quot;.	2001-11-18

Well, let's just say this is not one of Stephen King's greatest hits!!  I certainly like the premise but I think a Novella would have been enough compared to this overly wordy behemoth.  I am a Stephen King fan from the first release of &quot;Carrie&quot;...a book I read and reread so much I had to buy a second copy!  &quot;Needful Things&quot; would be a great Television Series..sort of in the manner of &quot;Friday, the Thirteenth.&quot;  Many other presentations from King are much much better.  If you are a Stephen King fan, you must read this story, just to finish &quot;The Castle Rock&quot; series of titles.

The &quot;Magic&quot; element within the story makes it slightly more interesting than it would have been without it, but that slight bit of magic doesn't really &quot;save&quot; the story.  All-in-All, I was satisfied with the story, just disappointed that it was written by Stephen King and not some lesser author.	2001-11-07

Well, I wasn't sure at first I was going to like this novel.  Hogan's use of first person during the first few chapters is not my favorite writing style but I stuck with it and VOILA!!!  What a TERRIFYING, TOTALLY GROSS, CAN'T-PUT-IT-DOWN story this turned out to be.  This makes you cringe at Humankind's defenselessness!<br />First there are Drs. Stephen Pearse and Peter Maryk, &quot;The Blood Artists.&quot;  Together, they are a whole person, acting with both commitment and conscience.  When they separate and go their own way for a few years, neither can act as complete and dedicated (and honorable) scientists, one possessing the charm and goodness (Pearse), the other (Maryk), possessing the determination and devotion to the &quot;virus&quot;.<br />Then there are the survivors of the devastagin &quot;Plainville&quot; virus that wiped out the entire town, except MILKMAID, LANCET and BLOSSOM.  Though they survived, their lives are hopelessly and completely changed forever.<br />Finally, we meet Oren Ridgeway a.k.a. &quot;Patient Zero&quot;.  But really he is never Ridgeway in the story, only &quot;Zero&quot;, as is totally and evily fitting.<br />In spite of the complicated story and the plethora of &quot;Main Characters&quot;, author Hogan does a fine job of weaving the plot and the lives of the characters into a story that you can actually care about.  In the end, I actually hoped for a sequel!!!  Perhaps Hogan will grant us that someday for after all, &quot;Plainville&quot; isn't really dead....	2001-11-07
US	52978434	RRHBPDZQJ6SVT	031207848X	826294613	Stones, Bones, and Ancient Cities: Great Discoveries in Archaeology and the Search for Human Origins	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fun Reading, Great Info, I Loved it!!	Well, I wasn't too sure when I started but by the time I finished the first chapter, &quot;Stones, Bones and Ancient Cities&quot; by Lawrence H. Robbins had me hooked so much I didn't get much sleep for the next few days.  The writing style is crisp, clean and easy to understand.  Robbins presents the cold-hard facts not just in layman's terms but in INTERESTING terms.  I really loved the map of important sites discussed in the book which helped to put things into real perspective.<br />Chapter 2 about Cave Art is really eye-opening and informative about this controversial and speculative area of anthropology.  Robbins also presents several Time-Lines at the back of the book that are also very informative.  I am also a HUGE fan of the Chapter-by-Chapter form of Notes to be terrific for those of us that like to add more and more reading materials to our shelves.  The photographs are fine though MORE is always better in these types of books.  <br />REALLY AN ENJOYABLE READ!!	2001-11-02

Charles Wilson is a very good writer but &quot;Fertile Ground&quot; is certainly is not his best production.  While I loved &quot;Direct Descendant&quot; and &quot;Nightwatcher&quot;, I thought that this storyline was choppy and too full of holes to be a really good read.  The story could use some reworking and many gaps filled in with quality elaboration, which I KNOW that Wilson is capable of doing.  &quot;Fertile Ground&quot; has a fertile plot that just never grows!	2001-11-02

Other than that, this book only flashes occassionally with interesting notions and bright ideas. Though I really wanted to enjoy this book [and tried to do so regardless of the Self-Absorbed blather] it was somewhat of a struggle. Perhaps if the author had left out all the back-slapping self congratulatory drivel, this would have been a top-quality presentation. SIGH, you must read between the drivel to get to the content. The content is nice but too cluttered for my taste.	2001-11-02

It is apparent that she is neither an expert nor an ingnoramous but rather an interested party when it comes to mummies.  She is &quot;one of us&quot;.  Sure we encounter the &quot;usual suspects&quot;, just in a different manner.  The reader gets to meet Egyptian mummies, just who knew that they were &quot;hard-as stone&quot; resinous creatures.  We also meet frozen Peruvian Princesses protected by obsessed mountain climbing antisocial scientists who endanger their existence by their very discovery.  What about Caucasian mummies in China!  Look out China, here come those Germans thinking they discovered EVERYTHING again!  And the chapter on Lenin and the Soviet Mortuary Scientists is absolutely fantastic!!  This is certainly a terrific and highly recommended narrative, a light-hearted and very informative look at the modern world of mummies, mummy studies, and mummyologists.	2001-10-10

William Sarabande proves in this first installment of the &quot;First American's&quot; series that he is a truly great writer.  His ability to quickly introduce the reader to characters that you can care about is really quite fantastic.  Sarabande paints a picture of his Pre-Historic times crisply, providing the reader with a vivid image on the landscape, elements, and people.  I could hardly wait to read the next book in the series!	2001-09-11

The topic of mummies brings to mind Boris Karloff and the horror flicks.  This book makes these amasing finds real...and HUMAN!  I found the scholarship to be seemingly complete and accurate and even as a Lay-Person, I could understand what great amounts of information humankind was gleening from the mummies.  In fact, I enjoyed reading this 2nd edition so much, I obtainined the 1st edition to have a look at &quot;The Classic&quot; work itself.  A truly great adventure.	2001-09-10

Books	4	23	24	N	N	Excellent First Introduction to the Indians of the Southwest	This book is BASIC in its context...don't expect any major revelations except, of course, if you haven't read anything about the Native Americans of the Southwest.  It is beatuifully illustrated with some color photos,  many excellent charts &amp; maps, and many many turn of the century  photgraphs of the area.  I live in Phoenix so many of the places are  familiar to me.  It is amazing to see a freeway going over a Hohokam  ballcourt or to note that many of the canals in use TODAY in Phoenix began  as Hohokam irrigation canals.  All in all, a nice book.  The publishers  could have cut costs a little, though, if they had used regular paper  instead of the heavy glossy paper, but the photos look so great on the  heavier paper it is worth the price.	1999-02-22

I am impressed at both the quality of the illustrations, artwork, and photographs and the simplicity in which the material is presented.  This is NOT a scholarly discussion of comparative religion.  Rather, it is a peaceful journey, pleasing to the eyes, easy on the mind, and regenerating to the soul.  I am a student of religious studies and would recommend this to anyone, regardless of their knowledge and scholarship (or lack thereof) in comparative religion.  It is not going to provide a learned scholar with any new insights but it just might be the ticket to getting someone to begin a journey using Houston Smith's &quot;Illustrated World Religions&quot; or Joseph Campbell's &quot;Power of Myth&quot;.	1998-07-29

Imagine my surprise when reading each chapter and getting to know Brother Gomes through his words, ideas, and gentle manner.<br />I had no idea that he was black or republican and am glad that my prejudices weren't activated.  These prejudices are a part of my life through the teachings I received from the church during my early years.  Now it is the members of the church to whom I look to relearn the TRUTH.  The fact that Gomes is gay, as I am, adds a touch of irony and validity to his presentation and ideas.<br />The only portion of the book I really felt was lacking was, in fact, the section on homosexuality.  I didn't feel a great sense of relief at his alternative definitions and meanings of the scripture.  Though I know in my heart of hearts my faith and salvation are not jeapordized by my sexuality, I did hope that some of t! ! hat old guilt and self-condemnation would be addressed.  Alas, at least for me, it was not.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who are looking for a first step on the path back to Faith.	1998-07-16

I was awe-struck at the detail that Ms. Armstrong presents and the masterful way in which she weaves the tale of the birth and coming of age of the God of Abraham.  Then, at the half-way point, it becomes a book on Islam, which is her specific area of expertise and interest.  As the chapters went by, I lost interest because we were no longer discussing God but Muslim theology.	1998-07-15

Richard Friedman is obviously a devout man of God who requires a logical understanding of where our roots of Christianity came from.  I spent some time discussing his proposals with several fundamentalist friends and found their final rebuff to Friedman's ideas, &quot;Well I guess you just have to take some things on faith alone.&quot;  God gave us brains, and quite extrordinary ones at that, to think with.  The contradictions of the Old Testament both within the text and within the world as we know it today drove me away from Christianity for 15 years.  Now, as I read and learn more about Christian reality and Hebrew history, I find my faith, belief, and reason coming together at a point that gets closer and closer to God, which I claim to be synonymous with The Truth.	1998-07-15

What I received was a beatiful little book with one verse or set of verses from the Christian scripture on one page and a verse from a sutra on the opposite page......that's it!!!  No scholarly discussion, no commentary, no historical information.....nothing else but the two &quot;versions&quot; of the same saying.  This reads more like a Hazelton daily meditation book than an academic comparison between the sayings of [perhaps] two of the greatest, most influential, and well known prophets of recorded history (the other being Muhammad).  This is a cute little book to keep in the bathroom or on your bed-side table.  It is NOT an academic or scholarly comparison of the Parellal Sayings of Jesus and the Buddha.  1 star for cuteness, 1 star for context, no stars for scholarship.	1998-06-30
