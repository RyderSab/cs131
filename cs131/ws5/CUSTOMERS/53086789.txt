They're as clearly written as editor Oliver Sacks' works and each has at least one topical issue to catch the reader's interest.  Some have several. <br /> <br />Each story has something fascinating about it: <br />* \\"The Forest Primeval\\" tells about an area of the Congo which humans hadn't penetrated -- and the impact of the wildlife on the ecology.  There are some surprising elements to it, including that it might once have been populated by humans. <br />* Mann's article from Atlantic Monthly goes through what the New World might have been like prior to Columbus -- and highlights a debate between new historians and traditionalists over whether the continent was empty -- or whether Old World diseases killed up to 90% of the population before colonists began arriving. <br />* \\"The Learning Curve\\" deals with the practical skills of learning to be a doctor.  Don't let me in the hospital any time soon . . . <br />* \\"Notes from a Parallel Universe\\" deals with the people who try to convince scientists of bizarre theories.  At Berkeley they even keep the crackpots papers. <br />* Learn about Seattle's Yuckies in \\"Shadow Creatures.\\" <br />* Gunjan Sinha's article on voles indicates that what you might be experiencing isn't love but a hormone called oxytocin. <br />* The article from New Republic titled \\"Fighting Chance\\" is a great story of research -- and how a scientist's career decision got made. <br />* \\"Why Turn Red?\\" unravels part of a mystery for why leaves turn red, an energy-consuming activity that often occurs when the leaves are at the end of the photosynthetic life. <br />* If you want a GREAT theme for a scary kids story for a fiction class, the stuff in \\"Got Silk\\" has the raw material for good science fiction. <br />* The essay on Hawking is interesting, if only because the bet that it refers tofrom 1997 was just settled about a month ago -- with Hawking admitting that he was wrong. <br />* Cassuto's essay from \\"Salon\\" portrays the impact of a scandal on the science world, where the collateral damage can be as broad as in the financial world. <br />* And finally, the last essay does justice to the career of Stephen Jay Gould, as a biologist, essayist and ardent enemy of creationist influence on public policy. <br />* Plus, you can even learn which TV show retired lab chimpanzees prefer. <br />  <br />I'm a sucker for the \\"Best American Short Stories\\" collections issued each year, but this collection of science essays exceeded my expectations.  So much so that I sent it to my daughter at college.	2004-09-08
US	53086789	R3J4NCYPYD2BBT	0399150757	314563349	City Room	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Gossipy Details	Gelb's book isn't an attempt to describe the broad sweep of power at the top of The New York Times.  For that you need Gay Talese's book, \\"The Kingdom and the Power\\".<br />Rather it's the story of the rise of a reporter to a key day-to-day editor from 1944 to the end of the century.  Many will find the stories and descriptions of maneuvering at the Time dry.  But his look at events of the world and how they shaped the newspaper is fascinating.<br />An example is when the newspaper initiates a luncheon with key newsmakers by hosting New York Police Commissioner Michael Murphy:<BR>\\"He spoke about the difficulties of protecting President Kennedy on his visits to New York.  The president, he said, liked to stop his motorcade to shake hands with admirers, who lined his route from the airport to Manhattan.  It was a tremendous headache for the Police Department, and Murphy said he had personally warned Kennedy to change his habits, for he made an easy target for the unhinged.<BR> <BR>\\"At that moment, the phone in the anteroom range and a waitress summoned Clifton Daniel.  He returned to the dining room looking stunned and ashen.  'President Kennedy has just ben shot in Dallas.'\\"<br />There are momentous events.  And there are the trivial (and gossipy ones).  For example, early in the book he describes in detail the speakeasy run by the father of TV host Barbara Walters.<br />But overall, this is well worth the effort and will introduce some interesting historical details even for those very familiar with American history from the end of World War II to the end of the century.	2004-05-23

With the perspective of 25+ years since the end of the war, David Anderson is able to put together a very complete look at the war.  <br />The chapters are clearly written and cover major issues: background; maps; American involvement in the war; diplomatic attempts to end the war; and even the impact on American culture.  <br />The book has a very complete bibliography, as well as useful timelines and a &quot;Vietnam A to Z.&quot;  Simply having all of the statistics on the cost of the war accumulated in one place is priceless.  That may make this book sound dry -- but it's not, as Anderson cuts through to key issues quickly and even provides vivid descriptions of major websites.	2004-04-29

This certainly would not be the perfect introduction to the late Stephen Jay Gould's writing and research styles. . .<br />Nonetheless, they are well-researched and written in Gould's loving detail for the accurate story, in contrast to the historical myth.  You might find yourself skimming the details of animal classifications to find the gems that remind us of major shifts in scientific thinking.<br />The second three sections are written to a broader audience and start with obituaries of Carl Sagan, Mel Allen and Joe DiMaggio.  These essays are more readable (though Gould continues his love for parenthetical additions at least twice on every page). In this latter half of the book, Gould covers subjects such as social Darwinism; Dolly (the cloned sheep) and the nurture vs. nature argument; ways in which evolution is visible among living species; and competitive equilibrium in nature.  Here Gould ensures that his essays are relevant to current social issues.	2002-07-16

Mayr's book is extremely well-organized and actually gets better as it progresses.  One of the finest chapters is near the end, &quot;How Did Mankind Evolve?&quot; where he spells out what we know and where the holes are in the human evolutionary record.  <br />Diagrams are usually very clear and a reader can see the work of a strong editor.  &quot;What Evolutions Is&quot; includes an FAQ (frequently-asked questions list); glossary; and appendix covering key evolutionary issues.<br />The reasons that it's not &quot;Evolution for Dummies&quot; is that it is replete with biological jargon and has occasional annoying lapses.  <br />The hardest chapters for the non-biologist are about the simplest of animals.  Ironically it's because these simple creatures have the longest names and a narrow significance to biologists, e.g., &quot;The protostomes and deuterstomes derived from ancestral bilateralian.&quot;  What that last sentence means is &quot;Multicellular animals split into two types of basic embryo formation.&quot;<br />An example of one of the lapses, Mayr uses &quot;mya&quot; as an abbreviation in dating of specieis throughout the book but it's Chapter 11 before &quot;mya&quot; is defined as &quot;million years ago.&quot;<br />Mayr covers an interesting range of 12 topics in the book and he avoids the typical trap of taking the history of evolutionary biology in chronological order, as many issues finish as dead ends.  Rather, he treats the main threads of evolutionary biology and succinctly describes how the scientific evidence has been gathered via paleontology, anthropology, genetics and biology.<br />It would be hard for a non-biologist to read this book and not find several surprises.	2002-06-12
US	53086789	R2Z9C7A7YLNS2O	1557504318	535008421	Combined Fleet Decoded: The Secret History of American Intelligence and the Japanese Navy in World War II	Books	5	29	29	N	N	Excellent detail -- but a great narrative too	The detail in examining all aspects of intelligence in the Japanese and American navies during WWII -- from fleet recognition, to traffic analysis, to wartime production information, to the role of Ultra and decryption -- make Prados' book an excellent study.  Those familiar with WWII issues will find lots of fresh material.<br />Prados is wise enough to limit the topic to just naval intelligence issues, but still fills 735 pages with detail and skill.  The pleasant surprise is that it's so well-written, building each issue to its climax in the wartime theater.  And, with 50+ years of perspective, you can feel the tide of the war shift after Guadalcanal.<br />The art of intelligence-gathering increased dramatically during this war because of radio intercepts, so Prados covers the topic chronologically.  He has an excellent analysis of Japanese Naval strategy at Pearl Harbor, during the Pacific conquest period, and the shift to a \\"defensive\\" strategy of the homelands. <br />Prados does an excellent job comparing the structure of Japanese and American intelligence-gathering; also in indicating both opportunities and limitations of intelligence in war-time.  The reader also sees the dramatic impact that war-time propaganda has in mis-leading military leaders.<br />Surprisingly low-tech intelligence issues are important at various points during the war: such as the absence of photo-reconnaissance early in the war for Americans.  For the Japanese navy, poor ship-recognition skills by Japanese pilots and skippers leads to assumptions that American carriers present no threat because they've been reported as sunk -- or that destroyers were cruisers or even battleships.<br />The book is closed by an excellent post-war period which does two things: follows the careers of major intelligence participants and discusses social aspects of military training.	2002-05-24

It is certainly complete form the viewpoint of Civil War activities of the general, relying on all known sources -- from Grant's letters to his military orders to analyses by others from the war.  <br />Particularly good is the analysis of Grant's presidential administration, treating his role in quashing the Ku Klux Klan; his policy toward American Indians; his role in the attempts by Jay Gould to corner the gold market.  This book is strongly recommended for understanding the Reconstruction period politics; also for Grant's role in disarming the 1876 constitutional crisis over the election -- one very similar to the crisis the country faced in the 2000 presidential election.<br />The only important topic not treated well is the aspect of the Civil War that William Tecumseh Sherman represented: war on civilian support for the rebellion.<br />In addition, Smith's writing style is crisp and lively; full of anecdotes.  The author's side-by-side contrasting two views of Grant expressed by the Adams' brothers is a classic.  And Smith's own appreciation of Grant's writing style caused me to seek out the general's Memoirs after reading this book.	2002-04-26

It's smooth, well-written and accurate in its description of how an Internet ISP operates.<br />Others seem to find the book preachy, but after a half-dozen Jacovich novels Roberts undoubtedly finds it necessary to do some explaining why Milan does what he does.<br />Roberts writing has become smoother during the series and characters are well-developed.  Local Cleveland color is excellent, but some aspects are well-developed and others are dropped in without contributing to the story.  For example, his description of the bridge at the site of the suicide is excellent, complete with historic context.  But his mention of a Cleveland Heights' passion, Mitchell's Candies, is superficial -- even though the store has a history as interesting as the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge.<br />Good detective fiction; a must read for Clevelanders and ex-Clevelanders like myself.	2002-02-14

It richly describes the ethnic tapestry of the country, weaving in folk tales and folk medicine.  The stories told by his mother and others are rich diversions in the story of his life and make this history more literary.<br />He has a highly developed sense of satire and irony, whether when plotting revenge against a strict teacher or when commenting, &quot;To make sure that there was no mistaking the nationality of those involved in designing and building most of the (Addis Ababa) university, the various gadgets and fixtures within them had the 'American Standard' imprint on them.&quot;<br />Highly readable, whatever your knowledge of Africa might be.<br />Highly recommended if you want to understand what type of economic structures are appropriate in the developing world.  Yet it's real strength is in the human story.	2001-03-16

It shows how talented players who were friends of Rose melted into other professions, lacking the single-minded drive that he had.<br />I want my daughter to read it because it's also an excellent profile of eastern private schools and the politics of getting admitted, being a student and professor.  Reston believes that both men at their peak represented the best of their profession.  (I can't tell my daughter that's the other side that she'd find interesting because it would be as well-received as a lecture.)<br />The book goes through the childhood of both men and their professional development.  The details on Rose's gambling are convincing: you literally see how Pete self-destructed.  I think that it was a cab driver who sums up how Pete could have saved himself right up to the end (the paraphrasing is mine: &quot;apologize, indicate that he'd never bet for or against Cincinnati, and gotten away from gamblers&quot;) but was so ego-centric that he was self-destructive.  As for betting on the Reds, it's clear that he did.<br />A well-told story, but Reston is not as crisp a writer as his father. His transitions are often awkward, leaving you wondering what topic he's on.  And there's a factual error so glaring that I wondered how a sportswriter or editor could let it get by -- he refers to the Chicago Cubs as the &quot;Southsiders.&quot;	2001-02-14

It is organized by month -- as it picks up 'popular' calendars and shows how they reflected the attitude towards life.  Most of the interesting points are made early in the book.  The book didn't carry enough of my daughter's interest for her to finish the last chapter, 'December.'  And it's easy to understand why: by that point the book is reduced to a discussion of major political events and how war was fought.  At this point it gets away from the core focus on what everyday life was like.<br />Lots of interesting points are made in the book: that the core English words were already formed (though perhaps pronounced with stronger accents); that the diet was very healthy (before introduction of sugars and high-fat animal foods); that people were taller than in the 15th and 16th century as a result of better diet; that the calendar was quite different; that there is evidence that monks wore underwear; that the rural diet had near-starvation periods; that baths were few even for the wealthy (monks had 5 on their schedule each year).<br />You almost wish for an FAQ section to this book to get to the really important questions:<BR>   -- what about toothpaste?<BR>   -- did foods vary strongly by region?<BR>   -- how much did people travel?<BR>   -- what was the legal age?  and the legal responsibilities?<BR>   -- were there tribal or local languages, as in Africa today?<BR>   -- how was family history passed along?<br /><br />This book is worth a quick read.

One helped Wilbur and Orville Wright in early  test flights; unaware of what was happening, one was flying a mission  nearby when Nagasaki was devastated by the atomic bomb; several tell  details of experiences as fighter pilots.<br />Broughton's book doesn't have a  theme or direction -- it simply tries to bring out the most-significant  accomplishments of each flyer's life.  It starts with the early days of  flight, progresses through time and ends with a story of space flight and  one from the Vietnam War.	1999-11-02

Many are tales that he wrote down of 19th Century life.  Several are collected into volumes about important parts of  life at the time, including &quot;Longhorns&quot; and &quot;The  Mustangs&quot;.<br />They provide great insight into the origin of those  animals and their importance to people who lived in those times.<br />Another  excellent Dobie book is &quot;I'll Tell You a Tale,&quot; with excerpts  from these two books and others.  The anthology includes tales of gold,  stories of irony, Old West characters, and saddle stories.	1999-11-02

I would never  have thought of experiencing the Turkish bathes of a Paris without the  wonderful story in TT: Paris.  And many would find it maudlin to go  exploring Pere Lachaise cemetery, until reading some stories of the  experience.<br />Rick Steves' travel guides do a good job of highlighting  particular things to see.

They put you in the mood to experiment when you travel and provide an eager anticipation of French culture.  I've read both and will probably take them  on an upcoming trip to France as pleasant refreshers.  They're good enough  that I've written to James O'Reilly and asked for sequels to both books,  hoping to deepen exposure to things French.<br />This book is truly eclectic  -- stories about French waiters; demolition teams working on removing  explosives from the two world wars; the Celtic stones in Brittany; the Wild  West atmospher of l'Ardeche; and stories of invasion and Normandy.  Just  about all of the stories have been published in newspaper or magazine  articles, but are very carefully selected to show a new dimension to  France.  You'll recognize a few of the authors (Jon Krakauer, 'Into Thin  Air,' and Peter Mayle, 'A Year in Provence').  The margin notes are also a  great addition to the flavor of the book.	1999-10-18

He does an excellent job of highlighting the attitudes of fellow soldiers, poor Southerners, plantation  owners, and new recruits.  Claire Swedberg, the editor, has footnoted the  book very well, giving context to many of the events mentioned in the book.   For every person mentioned, Swedberg has provided some background on their  service -- or whether they even survived the war.<br />Passages such as King  debating with a plantation owner over whether the Bible condones or  condemns slavery -- where each side quotes verse -- make this a fascinating  window into the past.  King's attitude in the diaries is one that reflects  the questioning of authority common to American soldiers.  He himself is a  private during most of the war, though he's promoted to corporal at one  point.  King evens disdains that rank!<br />It's not as conversational as  Wilbur Fisk's diaries (&quot;Hard Marching Every Day&quot;) but very  readable.  The diary ends abruptly in September, 1864, 10 months before the  end of the war and King's return to his family.	1999-10-18

His historical research is good, citing a number of written sources (and even  giving new perspective on Fremont or Pike).<br />But the real color of the  book comes from his anecdotes, many of which come from discussions with  cowboys and mustangers who lived through the final days of the open range  in the American West.

It does a revealing job of describing the current cultural or political conditions in Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia and even India.  Naipaul provides more sense of continuity and sense of cultural development than in past books.<br />However, there are points where one might feel lost in the details of Muslim societies, particularly in the sections on Indonesia.  The sections on Iran and Pakistan are much more crisply written.  Happily, there's a reprise on Indonesian Muslim topics at the end of the book that is much clearer than the first third of the book.<br />As usual for Naipaul, this book is well-researched and has wonderful historical detail.  He's less judgemental than in earlier books, but forms clear opinions nonetheless.	1998-06-18

Dwells on alcohol-related accidents, even though 1995 and 1996 accident statistics show only one (1) fatality and two accidents related to alcohol during the two years.  The book places blame on the FAA, FBOs, ATC for not running a police state and blames everyone by the pilot.  (Of course the pilots involved in accidents all liberally assigned blame elsewhere too.)

It shows the city through the eyes of a soldier after the war; a dumped lover recovering in the City of Light; a Frenchman who sees Paris as the center of his cultural life.  There are undoubtedly places mentioned that you haven't seen, even if you've been to Paris a dozen times.  And the essays illuminate the history of several important Paris icons.    A great collection to be read while on the plane to Paris!	1997-04-17
