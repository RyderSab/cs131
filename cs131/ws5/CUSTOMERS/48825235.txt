After reading the first few chapters of this book, I was cursing Dickens thinking, \\"How many more obstacles are you going to throw in this poor boy's way?  Hasn't he taken enough?\\"<br /><br />I actually wanted to wrap my arms around Oliver and tell him that somebody cared about him (another poor boy, Dick, did that for me as Oliver ran away to London, Dickens having redeemed himself).<br /><br />In this edition, Edward Le Comte of Columbia University stated that Oliver's troubles stemmed from the surrogate fathers he had in his life (Fagin, Sikes, etc.) and got love from his surrogate mothers (Rose, Mrs. Maylie, even Nancy).  How true.  Oliver flourished under Rose and Mrs. Maylie, even Nancy felt a maternal instinct towards the boy.  To me, it was this surrogate maternal love that kept Oliver going and held out hope for his future.<br /><br />The part of this book that rocked me was the very end, as Mr. Brownlow, who eventually adopted Oliver as his own son, extracted the truth from Oliver's half-brother Monks.  Throughout the book, Dickens did not even hint at the fact that Oliver's father (who is Monks's father) was Mr. Brownlow's dear friend (Oliver came across Mr. Brownlow as his pocket was being picked by the group of thieves Oliver unknowingly came upon as he sat by himself upon his arrival to London from the cruel life he experienced in the country).<br /><br />What are the chances of picking the pocket of a stranger who just so happens to be your father's best friend?<br /><br />It was nice to see the gang of thieves get theirs in the end (although too bad for Nancy that she suffered the end that she did).<br /><br />An enjoyable read.  Very anxious to see Roman Polanski's take on the book, with his movie coming out at the end of this month.month.	2005-09-04

Once I started questioning why I was keeping stuff, I had the strength to let it go and not feel bad about it.  I haven't looked back since.<br /><br />After re-reading this book, it strengthened my resolve to keep clutter out of my life as best I can.  Her reasoning is based on common sense, really, not \\"real\\" Feng Shui: If your friends do nothing but drag you down, time to move on.  If those letters from an old flame hold nothing but bad memories, what's the point in torturing yourself by keeping them?  If you haven't worn that outfit yet, what makes you think you'll wear it sometime this year (even though you've been promising yourself you're going to lose weight to get back into those jeans for years)?<br /><br />Karen also gives advice on how to reduce the chance of re-introducing clutter into your life by questioning the purpose of every single piece of paper you have.  Through reading her book, I have become conscientious of clearing out every so often and I find myself, indeed, questioning every paper that I intend to keep (and many papers hit the recycle bin because of that!).  Same thing for clothes: If they don't fit, bundle them up and give them to people who can use them.<br /><br />Her book also enabled me to let go of many books, tapes, CDs, and DVDs that I have owned for nearly 10 years (along with making it easier to donate clothes that have outlived their usefulness).  I have about 25% of what I used to have and made a few hundred dollars from selling the aforementioned stuff.<br /><br />Kingston makes ton of sense.  Frankly, this is the only book you'll ever need on space clearing.  Her advice is practical and has forever changed my life.<br /><br />And, because of her space clearing habit, Karen is able to split her time between two continents during the year.  I very much doubt other people can say the same.lars from selling the aforementioned stuff. <br /> <br />Kingston makes ton of sense.

Goodness knows how many lives come apart or end in Hollywood every single day because of broken dreams or the fact that some people are cut out to be the movie equivalent of one hit wonders and they just can't deal with it).<br /><br />Much has been said about Hollywood over the years, and many pop singers and groups have made references to such in their songs, but it really doesn't hit home until you've read at least one account of just how sad, confused, and chaotic Hollywood life can be.<br /><br />Crivello wrote much on Marilyn Monroe (who already had a library written about her when this book was published in 1988) but he also focused a lot of attention on other well-known actresses whose end came much too soon.  He focused on Barbara Payton, who, in my opinion, had to have had the saddest life of all the women in this book.  Here was a woman who made a strong impression in 1950 opposite James Cagney in \\"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye\\" and, instead of being given bigger and/or better roles, she was given a secondary role in \\"Dallas\\" later that year.  In time, her personal life, not her acting, became the focus of attention and that eventually led to studio executives shunning her because of who she dated and her own personal downfall because her professional life suffered because of it.<br /><br />My personal favorite of this book is, of course, Sharon Tate.  I'm always hungry to know more about her (since the focus has been on the wrong \\"people\\" all these years) and this was probably one of the only in-depth articles about her up until 1988.  It wouldn't be until 12 years later when Greg King's book, \\"Sharon Tate and The Manson Murders,\\" would hit bookshelves that a true book would be written about her life.<br /><br />It has been heartbreaking over the years to hear about how not only her professional life was cut short but, more importantly, how her dream of motherhood was stolen from her.  But one can't grasp the depth of that loss until you read what Crivello dug up in the mid-to-late 1980's (this before the advent of the Internet and ubiquitous use of computers).  Sharon was so beautiful that agents didn't know what to do with her until she met Marty Ransohoff, who decided not to groom her for TV but for motion pictures.  In the short years of her movie career, she was given either minor parts or parts in movies that tanked (she even told her roommate Sheila Wells to not bother to see her movies).<br /><br />I've always been struck by Sharon's sweetness in the few mentions I've read about her and it was refreshing to see that Hollywood, as well as her beauty, didn't go to her head.  I really wish she had a little bit more time to see what she would have done with her acting career.<br /><br />Another case that tugged at me was Inger Stevens, star of the 1960's comedy, \\"The Farmer's Daughter.\\"  A touch of irony here is that because she was so embarrassed to be a foreigner when she came to the US at 13 years old, and the fact that her college professor father didn't want their native tongue spoken in the house, she lost her Swedish accent (which she would need for her future role).<br /><br />She misconstrued casual encounters as the great loves of her life.  Those affairs affected her so deeply that she tried to commit suicide on January 1, 1960.  She was found three days later by a building janitor who was asked to break into her apartment at the request of an executive from NBC who was concerned that he hadn't from her in a few days.  Miraculously, she survived (she suffered lifelong physical damage, such as blurred vision in one eye).<br /><br />Because of her success on \\"The Farmer's Daughter,\\" she was able to save and invest her money (which she did wisely).  She gave generously of hertime to charity but it just wasn't enough to beat the feelings of depression and loneliness she suffered throughout her life.<br /><br />The end of the book is composed of one paragraph summations of starlets who lives ended, for the most part, by swallowing whole bottles of sleeping pills or swallowing barbiturates (these two methods of suicide seem to be wide-used by former actors and actresses).<br /><br />Crivello drives home the point that the \\"Hollywood machine\\" is very successful in magnifying a person's insecurities.  Even when someone had a successful role, their acting career looked bright, and they were able to live comfortably because of their hard work, it still couldn't beat out depression and other negative feelings.<br /><br />Money and fame just cannot buy happiness and emotional security, no matter how long or hard you try.<br /><br />This is definitely worth the read but, be forewarned, you'll come away from this book with a heavy feeling at the amount of young lives that were cut short by the Hollywood machine.<br /><br />Now if we can only see the males side of the story.generously of her time to charity but it just wasn't enough to beat the feelings of depression and loneliness she suffered throughout her life.  <br /> <br />The end of the book is composed of one paragraph summations of starlets who lives ended, for the most part, by swallowing whole bottles of sleeping pills or swallowing barbiturates (these two methods of suicide seem to be wide-used by former actors and actresses). <br /> <br />Crivello drives home the point that the \\"Hollywood machine\\" is very successful in magnifying a person's insecurities.

After digesting my mistake, I decided to get my money's worth - and what a disappointment!<br /><br />Like a few reviewers pointed out, these are reprints of Vanity Fair articles from years past.  All one has to do is look at the very end of each \\"chapter\\" for the updates, and you'll get the idea of this \\"book.\\"<br /><br />She is a good writer and has a way of letting out her opinion without being confrontational about it.  She told the deep, dark ugly truth about the overrated has-been Michael Jackson (who hit his peak with 1983's \\"Thriller,\\" made a somewhat good comeback with \\"Bad\\" in 1987 and has only been kept in the public eye since then due to the trashy tabloids and his weird antics).<br /><br />As for Laci Peterson: That's another topic she was right on about.  There's a case going on right now in Philadelphia about a missing pregnant woman who is only getting so much media attention because she is related to a city councilman so I completely dig her point that some cases get more publicity than others because family and/or friends are media-savvy.<br /><br />But had this been an *original* piece of writing, Maureen should have widened her scope to include why political pundits (including her own husband) are treated as celebrities.  Writers usually take a backseat to the things they write about but that is definitely not the case anymore as the persona means much more than the substance.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that I spent money for what I thought was going to be a book when I could have saved myself the dough and read back issues of V.F.<br /><br />Wait until this is in the Last Chance bin at your local (chain) bookstore.	2005-08-02

For the three or four websites she mentioned throughout, she cited no less than a half-dozen book titles to back up her research.<br /><br />Even though my eyes glazed over when she started in about the Catholic Church (I was subjected to it for 13 years, which was quite enough for me, thank you), I did find her takes on certain Christian mysteries, such as the Shroud of Turin, very interesting.  The chapter on the \\"Lost Years of Jesus\\" was, again, very interesting and confirmed some suspicions that I've held.<br /><br />In all, it's worth the money and definitely the time to read.

This unapologetic right-wing partisian's teary-eyed tribute to one of the worst presidents in this country's history - Raygun Ronnie Reagan (for whom she was a speechwriter) - was not only nauseating but, of course, she just had to get her digs in at Bill Clinton.<br /><br />It says alot about how far we've \\"progressed\\" as a participating democracy when a president is impeached on the grounds of lying about an extra-marital affair (but impeachable offenses don't include invading sovereign countries because Republican presidents don't happen to like the democratically elected leaders there or sending other peoples' kids to die to ensure this country's oil supply).<br /><br />Then again, what could someone who's looking for the *whole* history of America (that would include the good, the bad, and the ugly) expect from right-wing Time magazine?<br /><br />I noticed these \\"history\\" compliations always overlook the fact that when the US went to invade Canada in the early-1800's, this country had its a** handed to them.

Why?  Well, apparently, shoveling cow dung on his Texas ranch was more important than national security.<br /><br />On the other hand, Bill Clinton wanted to take care of business and assassinate Osama but congressional Republicans were too busy worrying about his sex life (while a Chinese scientist came in through the backdoor and stole nuclear secrets, while Osama and company had time to get their game plan together.  \\"Morality\\" was more important than national security and it's all Bill Clinton's fault?

Though written in 1965, it proves that even though times change, emotions and some situations don't.<br /><br />Jerry Payne was on his way to college when he meets Pookie Adams in the bus depot. She is a year younger - she's on her way back home to begin her senior year in high school - and her nonstop talking and outlook on life really irks him. They take one bus together to another stop and, sitting next to each other, start talking about everything and nothing at once. Suddenly, before Jerry knows it and not being able to stop it, he finds himself kissing Pookie.<br /><br />By the time his bus pulls away, taking him to college, Pookie realizes she never got his address (or name, for that matter!) and he shouts his information out the window.  Jerry didn't think Pookie heard him but 17 letters reach him from September to Valentine's Day. His father asked him if he was running a forwarding service and to please give the woman his college address.<br /><br />While Pookie's letters were coming, Jerry got involved in college life - of the fraternity kind. His roommates were into the frat thing and Jerry at first wanted to show that he could be part of the crowd in a sophisticated way (with his guitar playing) but, in time, he fell into the swing of things like the rest of them. By the time Jerry and Pookie reunited (during her freshmen year of college, he having seen her picture in a college publication in the frat house's library and he and his buddies showing up at her sorority house uninvited and unwelcome), Jerry was the stereotypical frat guy - reeking of beer, plopped in a brother's jalopy (that was affectionately called \\"The Bitch\\"), and failing everything ... fast.<br /><br />It was during his sophomore year in college that he and Pookie really got together - Jerry slowly, and unknowingly at first, falling in love with Pookie through her letters. He would cut classes in the morning to wait for her letters, he couldn't wait to meet her for houseparties and weekend get togethers.<br /><br />When he was in danger of failing school, he begged the academic powers that be for another chance and was granted a stay. He vowed to work through the spring break to pull himself together. During this time, he and Pookie lived together at the frat house and fell even deeper in love.<br /><br />When Jerry, Pookie, and a few friends were partying in the college cemetery in his junior year, they were in the middle of a toast on top of a grave marker when the dead woman's husband - one of the most respected professors of the university - came upon the scene, flowers dropped to his side, and simply walked away (probably too hurt for words). This scene coming after all four of them were lying in the grass and Jerry just sensing that the magic had left his relationship with Pookie.<br /><br />After that incident, things were never quite the same between Jerry and Pookie. They drifted apart, without really knowing it. Towards the very end, they couldn't even agree on a suicide pact - how to do it, who was going to go first, etc.  It seemed as though both of them were trying to hold on to the dead relationship for dear life but it got to the point where Pookie said, \\"It's all over, isn't it?\\"<br /><br />The book comes to an ending where you have to fill in the blanks (did Pookie commit suicide or not? Jerry didn't feel a need to know for sure) but it's the sort of ending life deals: You fall in love with someone whom you never thought you'd even remotely like in a million years, you have an intense relationship with them (physically and emotionally), and then, for unknown reasons, the magic disappears (almost overnight).  What you found cute and lovable before becomes tiresome.  Even so, you try to hold on but you can't.  You feel the relationship is over but it's like no one ever gets around to formally ending it.<br /><br />In the end, the person falls into a special place in your heart and mind but you feel as if you'll spoil the memory of that time in your life by getting an update every now and again.<br /><br />Forty years later and love sure doesn't change its tune.he end, the person falls into a special place in your heart and mind but you feel as if you'll spoil the memory of that time in your life by getting an update every now and again. <br /> <br />Forty years later and love sure doesn't change its tune.	2005-07-04

This is the first novel I've read from Kurt Vonnegut and I'm hooked!  While not gung go about science fiction, I appreciate his writing style and the way he made the story come together in the end.<br /><br />While Winston Niles Rumfoord told Malachi Constant, the fortunate (only) son, about his destiny on Mars (that he was to have a son, Chrono, with his wife, Beatrice Rumfoord, there), we await to see exactly how they got over their loathing of each other long enough to produce a child.  So while we're following the adventures of \\"Unk,\\" waiting to see where Malachi is going to come in, it's only three quarters of the way into the novel that we realize that they're one and the same person.<br /><br />As the \\"family\\" of Malachi, Beatrice, and Chrono leaves Earth one last time for Titan, Winston does them the favor of explaining everything in full detail to them - in front of the crowd - about who they were on Earth before their memories were cleaned out on Mars.  None of them could have cared less (much less Chrono) but Malachi (the Space Wanderer, whose appearance on Earth was cause for much celebration) and Beatrice vowed to never again be used by Rumfoord.<br /><br />It was pretty cool to see, in the end, how Malachi wound up missing Beatrice after she died on Titan.  The three of them wound up caring about each other in their own way (even if Chrono wound up being way closer to his mother than he ever was with his father, something that Malachi came to accept).<br /><br />The only bad thing (if you can call it that) was that I was disappointed to not see Winston Niles Rumfoord really get his in the end.  I think he completely got off the hook for sabotaging the Martian \\"invasion\\" of Earth, for engaging in erasing peoples' memories, and for just being a total jerk.<br /><br />I'm sorry I didn't read this book sooner.

He goes to the apartment building only to be greeted by the rudest \\"concierge\\" (who possesses attitude-plus concerning anything in the way of human contact) and a very judgmental landlord, Monsieur Zy.  After arguing about what would be called a deposit (Zy wanting 500,000 francs and Trelkovsky only able to fork up 400,000), Zy said he'd need a few days to think about it.<br /><br />Before the meeting with Monsieur Zy, the concierge tells Trelkovsky of the previous tenant - a woman who threw herself out of the window.  Needing to see the woman in person (to get a feel of who lived in the apartment before him), he goes back to the building the next day and manages to get the name of the woman out of the concierge - Simone Choule.<br /><br />Trelkovsky visits Simone in the hospital and it's there that he meets one of her friends, Stella, who wonders why Simone would commit suicide when there were no signs anything was wrong.  After Stella asks Simone whether she recognizes her, the woman lets out an ear-piercing scream that prompts the head nurse to remove the both of them from her bedside.<br /><br />After Simone dies, Trelkovsky is offered the apartment and the transformation into Simone Choule slowly begins.  The neighbors' reactions to every little creak he made caused him to become withdrawn, distance himself from his friends and coworkers (the few that he has), and to worry about every little move he makes.<br /><br />He hangs out with Simone's friends, smokes her brand of cigarettes instead of his own, and develops a taste for dry toast and chocolate (instead of drinking coffee) - her choice of breakfast that the waiter gave to Trelkovsky without his even asking for it or his objecting to it.<br /><br />After he refuses to sign a petition to evict a neighbor with a crippled daughter from the building, he comes down with a violent fever that leaves him bedridden for a week.

I'm fascinated that people could write well enough to keep a listening audience's attention for a full thirty minutes and make them want to keep listening until the end.  I have great respect for the actors and actresses of the era when radio was king as it takes a lot of talent to let your voice do the acting.  Today, an \\"actor\\" or \\"actress\\" can get away with being attractive and being a bigger hit with trashy tabloids more than at the box office.<br /><br />It is well known how much people were freaked out by this broadcast (so much so that the FCC launched an investigation including looking at whether or not Welles and his fellow actors were not part of some conspiracy to create such a hysteria) and, while listening to this, it's easy to imagine channel surfing on the evening of October 30, 1938 and catching the program well after Welles stated the obvious: That it was a radio play based on the H.G. Wells novel of the same title.  It was authentic in that it included the names of men in FDR's cabinet and picked out small towns in Northern New Jersey where Martians initially landed.  And, as another reviewer previosuly pointed out, the show was done in the same format that radio news shows were done then, so for those who missed Orson's explanation of the program, they were bound to think this was the real thing happening at that place and at that time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mass hysteria and publicity (dare I say infamy?) was no doubt a jinx on the talented Welles.  True, he made the mighty classic \\"Citizen Kane\\" in 1941 but, apart from that, he was, and still is, remembered as the guy who made people think that the world was really being attacked by Martians.  Near the end of his life he made a comment on his career, \\"I started at the top and worked my way to the bottom.\\"<br /><br />It's a shame things turned out the way they did for Welles but one thing's for sure, he sure stirred up plenty of mischief on that Mischief Night in 1938.s career, \\"I started at the top and worked my way to the bottom.\\" <br /> <br />It's a shame things turned out the way they did for Welles but one thing's for sure, he sure stirred up plenty of mischief on that Mischief Night in 1938.	2005-06-24

It does go into all that when you're a bit into it but if you're someone who needs to know the basics at the beginning, then Destinos is definitely not for you.<br /><br />The premise of Destinos is an interesting one - a wealthy patriarch on his deatbed receives a letter from a mystery woman in Spain making claims about deeply hidden secrets from the man's past.  He hires a Los Angeles-based attorney, Raquel Rodriguez (who serves as the course's on-air instructor), to investigate the claims.  He wants her to solve the mystery before he dies.<br /><br />Raquel's quest takes her to many Spanish countries including, among others, Mexico, Argentina, Columbia, and Spain.  Students are treated to many cultural aspects of these countries but the pace of the instruction is too quick for a beginner (and too quick for me, as someone who was refreshing my Spanish from high school).<br /><br />Only recommended if you are one for an immersion course and a quick learner.	2005-06-09

Since we're so accustomed to speaking English and we learned the finer points of it so long ago in elementary school, we forgot that we had to memorize the parts of speech and learn different expressions.  The same is true for learning another language.<br /><br />I can dig what the majority of folks here complain about the series not putting any of your new knowledge to practice - the second most important part of learning a language (if not tied for most important).<br /><br />The Living Language series is a starter course, designed to give beginners the basics of the language - the alphabet, foreign letters in that language's alphabet (the letters j, k, x, w, and y are not part of the Italian alphabet), cognates (similar words in Italian and English), everyday expressions, and so on.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend the Living Language series as the be all and end all of language instruction.  It is one of the cheapest programs on the bookshelf and the final product is a reflection of that.<br /><br />The best bet to learning a language is going to the local community college (if you have the money and the time) and taking a course there, although those are more inclined to be immersion courses (where the instructor's idea of learning a language is for you to hear it spoken and learn it as you go along) or you could go to your local Italian cultural society and see what they have to offer (Philadelphia, for instance, has the America-Italy Society which offers Italian language classes.  The Sons of Italy, at least in these parts, do not offer such).<br /><br />Learning another language is not the same for everyone.  What works for some may not work for others.	2005-06-05

This is a definite beginner/refresher course, designed to familiarize the person with basic everyday expressions, the alphabet, numbers, cognates (words that are similar in French and English), and so on.<br /><br />The main point of language instruction is memorization - something we all had to do in elementary school all those years ago.  I understand the majority of the reviewers' gripe about the series not putting what you've learned to use.  I echo that sentiment in wishing that this series would include more exercises other than match this expression with the correct answer.<br /><br />It may seem a bit empty to just have a native speaker reading off a list of the alphabet, numbers, and everything else in the course book but to hear a native speaker pronouncing the language is key.  If you can pick up from that person the way words in that language are pronounced, chances are pretty good that you can be understood by native speakers when you do your own pronounciation.<br /><br />Language instruction is different for everyone.  If you have the time and the money, perhaps a course at the local community college will do (although those tend to be immersion courses - where the instructor starts right in with the language whether you understand it or not) or you could go to the local French society for some classes.  In Philadelphia, we are fortunate to have the Alliance Francaise de Philadelphie that offers French language courses.  They are a bit expensive (for members and non-members) but the teachers are directly from France.  Can't beat that!<br /><br />Treat the Living Language series as a primer for more in-depth language instruction.	2005-06-05

Kensingtonians are famous for their daydreams and even more famous for never achieving what they thought they could or should.<br /><br />I can't laugh hard enough at the current attempts by the City of Philadelphia to \\"revitalize\\" Kensington (I'm laughing at the unbelievable development Fishtown, of all places, has seen in recent years).  The city might as well just drop taxpayer money into a bottomless pit because that's what they're doing here.<br /><br />I have had strangers come up to me and say that the neighborhood started going downhill in the 1950's!  From other books that I've read, I've seen that Kensington went south starting with the Great Depression in 1929, saw a spurt of mills and factories roll around during WW II, but then completely die shortly thereafter.<br /><br />This work shows the true mindset of a Kensingtonian, past and present (and, no, this is NOT across the board): To go to school, work and live within a three block radius of their house and to go to the corner bar every weekend.  They have no ambition in life but to drink and have babies they can't support.  They refuse to shed their village mentality.  (And they consider moving to the Northeast moving up and going to the Jersey shore a \\"vacation\\".)<br /><br />The reason why the neighborhood went the way it did was because working folks moved out and they sold to the lowest common denominator.  I know of others who left because they were shot at (for having the temerity to try to turn the neighborhood back around) or couldn't deal with being a law abiding person while the local police were busy coddling the neighborhood bad guys (I've seen that for myself.)<br /><br />The author was one who put her money where her mouth was and tried to keep her factory open to employ local residents but it was to no avail.  She even had to admit that neighborhood kids (and this was back in the 1970's!) would vandalize her factory - stealing and destroying supplies - and the parents were in full denial of their kids' wrongdoing.

To have \\"parents\\" such as Ryan and Joanna Moore is bad enough but to have those parents be famous, where there's really nothing anyone can do to take their kids away from them short of death, is unthinkable.<br /><br />It was refreshing to finally get the story \\"from the horse's mouth,\\" as the cliche goes.  The only things I have ever read about Tatum were from the trashy tabloids (where 95% of the stuff they print is fictional).  Those rags consistently painted Tatum as nothing more than a selfish, drug addicted psycho-case hell bent on destroying her life as well as those of her children (they still do to this day).<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />This woman was basically on her own from the time she was 6 or 7 years old.  Her \\"mother\\" was concerned about looking good all the time and her \\"father\\" was so self absorbed he should be pictured next to the definition of the word narcissist.<br /><br />I do admit that I got a bit tired of Tatum taking the easy way out with drugs.  But then, as I read on, I realize hers is one of those cases where you HAVE to do something to numb the pain and hurt.  (I'll admit: Had I experienced a tenth of the crap that she did, I would have done myself in long ago.)<br /><br />What's saddest of all is that she didn't get a break when she got married.  Instead, she picked a guy exactly like her father.  While apparently a great father, John McEnroe's husband skills left a lot to be desired.  (And, for real, he should have told his family to buzz off when it came to his marriage.  His case just goes to prove that family and business just don't mix.)<br /><br />I appreciated Tatum's honesty in telling her story.  I really thought this was going to be one of those book-length screeds where everyone is at fault for the way the author turned out but that's simply not the case.  Tatum took full responsibility for her actions, and laid blame at the doorstep of others when it was appropriate.<br /><br />I wish Tatum, Griffin, and Redmond all the best in getting rid of their demons once and for all.  I hope, in time, they will become comfortable in their skins and tell their misfit parents to take a long walk off a short cliff.<br /><br />Too bad more folks in Hollywood (and Washington) can't be as honest as she was.<br /><br />This book should be a case study for parents in how to keep your children as far away from Hollywood as possible until they can make up their own minds.

E., about the destruction Mount Vesuvius wrecked upon everyone that surrounded her and about how his uncle, Pliny the Elder, had died in Stabiae because of the noxious fumes that suffocated the air.  You're not getting a better first-hand account than that!<br /><br />The intended audience for this book is not a scholarly one, so that would explain why it's not loaded with Latin and Greek words and/or phrases.  But if the text contained such words, that's why Latin and Greek dictionaries are around - to look up those words.<br /><br />You'll need to look at this book a few times: One to read the text and another to just look at the pictures and read the equally informative captions.  You'll learn alot.<br /><br />But no matter how much I've read and watched about the city over the years, I still can't grasp why Pompeii had to suffer so much.  They were way ahead of time with the everyday instruments they used (a printing press, a duplicate of which would not be made until over a thousand years later), bathing to keep diseases at bay (something that Nostradamus would rediscover fifteen hundred years later during the Black Plague).  As the author points out, Pompeii had a standard of living that would not be achieved again until the 1950's.  (So much for progress!)<br /><br />A fantastic read.	2005-03-07

People here are comparing the stories they've heard over the years of the antics of pop stars to this and what happened then pales in comparison to what goes on today.  People have to remember that Kane grew up in the 1950's and what was going on in the early-to-mid 1960's was never seen before (and hasn't been seen since).  It was like living in another world and time period.<br /><br />This all happened in 1964 at a time when people held way more conservative views and the slightest bit of impropriety would have destroyed an act and blackballed them from show business.  Singing acts, solo artists and groups, also avoided the taboo subject of politics, especially the undeclared war in Viet Nam.<br /><br />Larry Kane did a very good job of taking you backstage to the then-longest tour in rock history and bringing you front row and center and explaining the mindset of the obsessed Beatles fan - the women who felt that their favorite Beatle was singing to only them and the men who felt they were related to one of them and were entitled to be in their presence.<br /><br />This book is a cut above the rest because Kane was actually there and had almost unlimited access to the boys (unlike others, whose books are basically compilations of everything they've ever read about the boys).	2004-12-03

I'm fascinated by the field of forensic science and just how increasingly sophisticated it gets everyday.  There is no such thing as the \\"perfect crime\\" as, literally, a drop of blood or a strand of human hair will place a criminal at the scene of the crime and lead to a conviction so I don't know why criminals (murderers in particular) keep trying.<br /><br />This book lays out the varied, gruesome, and hectic duties of people in the field of forensic science: From forensic pathologists to forensic dentists to botanists (who play vital roles in describing where certain plants and flowers grow just in case a murderer comes up with the brilliant idea that cactus can grow in water), various fields of expertise are explored in great detail and emphasis is placed time and again on the fact that these very different people and fields must work together as a team in order to process a crime scene effectively, conduct an autopsy correctly, and later put together an air-tight case in court.<br /><br />Despite the confusing layout (why do publishers insist on putting these shaded boxes and side charts and bars on every other page?  It's confusing and takes away from the message of the text), you'll come away from this book with a deeper appreciation for what these people do on a daily basis.<br /><br />After seeing some of the photos in this book and digesting the depth of their responsibilities, I can really understand why some folks in law enforcement snap.  It's hard to keep your emotions in check when you have to process or even look at a crime scene where, for example, a child, literally, had their head bashed in by a hammer.  It's a requirement for the job in order to collect all pertinent information for the prosecutor to later use in court but it must bother many of these law enforcement officials, no matter how many years they've put in.<br /><br />From arriving at the crime scene to conducting the autopsy to performing a toxicological test to getting a conviction in court, an excellent job was done in breaking forensics down by who does what./> <br />From arriving at the crime scene to conducting the autopsy to performing a toxicological test to getting a conviction in court, an excellent job was done in breaking forensics down by who does what.	2004-11-29

He strikes me as a person with a very powerful presence and state of mind and that impression certainly comes through in his films.<br /><br />Although published 20 years ago, Roman bared his soul to the world, telling his story in a way that you felt you lived his life right there beside him.<br /><br />People who believe that those who have had lousy lives should be excused from taking responsibility for their crimes should read Roman's book.  After all he's been through, he had every excuse in the world to be a lowlife, drunken, drug addict, thief, murderer, scumbag.  Instead, this man took all the bad things that have happened to him in his life and turned it into something positive.<br /><br />And even though he has expressed his emotions through his movies, he is still a very mysterious man whose depths no one will ever know.<br /><br />That's what makes Roman so damn intriguing.	2004-11-15

Something tells me this \\"book\\" wasn't written in Ric Flair's wrestling character. If that's the case, then he's every bit the egotist he's portrayed in the ring for years and then some. I realize only now what a mistake it was to make this guy my role model as an eleven year old girl. Had I known a quarter of who Richard Fliehr really was, I would have run for the hills.<br /><br />I never knew he was adopted in everything I've ever read about him over the years. And while I realize that parents (natural or adoptive) aren't perfect, Ric never expressed any gratefulness that a strange couple took him into their home and raised him as their own. Not only that, but for all his sniffing about his parents' social status (his father was a doctor, which enabled Ric to associate with a more affluent crowd than most adoptees) Flair is actually proud of the fact that he's not much of a reader. If it's not a right-wing rag like Time or something shallow like Sports Illustrated, it's above his head. So much for encouraging people to read and broaden their horizons. (And he repaid his parents' kindness by having numerous run-ins with the law.)<br /><br />As a super Nature Boy fan, I got bored quickly at the predictability of his matches. As countless people have said, \\"you've seen one, you've seen them all.\\" He had no aerial game (I never once saw him perform a dropkick) and he's going to blast others for their wrestling ability???<br /><br />His wrestling style stinks and his attitude stinks even more. It's one thing to have fun when you're young but the way he treated women during the course of his life is despicable. I mean greeting a woman you barely know by sneaking up behind her as she's sitting on a couch with your genitals is sexist to the max (as well as having a contest with your friends about how many women you can screw in a certain amount of time). How immature.<br /><br />The way he treated his first wife was pathetic. I heard over the years that Leslie had it hard with him but I never knew just how bad it was. It was nice to see he has a conscience (rare for a Republican) and regrets treating her the way he did but it seems he doesn't understand why she's still bitter about it (it would have nothing to do with her wasting prime years of her life supporting you in your wrestling endeavors and having to endure marital infidelity, raising two children basically on her own, and being embarrassed in front of her friends by coming home to find her husband lying face down in vomit among many other misadventures, huh, Ric?). After what she went through, I'd be bitter, too.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me the most about this book was how Flair badmouthed some great wrestling legends and sucked up to others who are overrated and don't deserve their hype. You'd think at his age, and with all the years of wrestling experience, he'd exercise better judgment.<br /><br />For anyone to say that Pedro Morales was a better wrestler than Bruno Sammartino is insane. Pedro was good but he didn't have the arsenal Bruno had or his drawing power (and to say that the reason why Sammartino was so big in the Northeast was because we still hold a strong ethnic identity was a typical cheap shot).<br /><br />While he's busy blasting Bruno, he sucks up to Shawn Michaels, who is one of the most overrated and undertalented wrestlers ever. Then again, when Flair is compared to other wrestlers of far greater talent and charisma, he comes up awfully shorthanded.<br /><br />And he needed to seriously get off the backs of Bret Hart and Mick Foley. Bret Hart was royally screwed over and embarrassed after 17 years of service to Vince McMahon and he's not allowed to say anything about it? Mick Foley has sacrificed more for the wrestling business in one day than Flair has in over 30 years.<br /><br />Bottom line: Flair badmouthed the people who were never impressed with him and praised the people who think he's the greatest thing since the beginning of time. Talk about a major ego.<br /><br />And he whined in the beginning of his \\"book\\" about people who were ruining the mystery of wrestling by bringing their kids around the venue while the wrestlers were rehearsing and explaining every facet of the business. Obviously, he doesn't realize just how much mystery he took out of wrestling with his \\"book.\\" After reading it, I feel relieved that I no longer waste my time with it anymore and feel sorry for myself that I wasted 10 years of my young life on this nonsense.<br /><br />Thanks for disillusioning me, Ric, in regards to the wrestling business and to you. Also, thank you for reminding me to be very careful in choosing people to emulate.ook\\" about people who were ruining the mystery of wrestling by bringing their kids around the venue while the wrestlers were rehearsing and explaining every facet of the business.

While in the Ministry of Love, when O'Brien told Winston that his mind was like his only Winston was insane, I thought, \\"How delusional we are.\\"  But, then again, \\"What can you do...against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy.\\"  (page 234)<br /><br />So many of the things that Orwell wrote in 1949 have turned into fact.  The far right religious and political folks have used \\"1984\\" as their blueprint for absolute and total hatred (whether intentional or not).  One of the requirements of being in the Party is that a member was prohibited from learning foreign languages or having any contact with a foreigner at any time (other than to see them rolled by as prisoners).  Maybe that's because \\"If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similiar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies.\\"  (page 174)<br /><br />This should be required reading for everyone and a blueprint on how to reject an absolute dictatorship bent on complete mind control and historical alterations.	2004-08-29

She remembered the smallest of details of life with her parents (whom she resided with only until the age of 5) and she was able to retain so much information in her early childhood during her training. That determination fostered a workaholic approach to her career when she became a maiko, where she set out to become Number One.<br /><br /> One thing that stood out for me was when Mineko pointed out that no two kimonos are alike and that the patterns on them indicates what stage a woman is in in her career.<br /><br /> I also learned about the turning of the collar and the differences between a red and white collar (red symbolizing a child, white an adult). At the age of 21, a woman becomes a full-fledged geiko.<br /><br /> There was an antagonist in the book, Yaeko. Someone needed to teach this woman (and, apparently, her sister) something called manners. This woman dumped all over Mineko, making life miserable for her during her training and deliberately embarassing her in front of customers. (Nice to see her get it in the end proving that &quot;what goes around comes around.&quot;)<br /><br /> Towards the end of the book, Mineko details how much the performers give to the profession but how the profession does not give back to the people who breathe life into it (not her words). She also sadly points out that the world of the geisha is dying out.<br /><br /> And despite her gripes with &quot;the system&quot; that she tried for so long to change and couldn't, she is truly sad about its bleak future.	2004-08-01

From the Federalist Papers to politicians (of both political persuasions) who are bought and paid for by corporations and the richest 1% (heck, many of today's politicians ARE from the upper class), America has turned into a servant of the &quot;Bank&quot;: Doing the bidding of the very richest.<br /><br /> I wonder if it hurts Americans to actually think about what this man is saying, and how he gets right to the point by using the foundation of the &quot;founders'&quot; intentions for this country: The Federalist Papers?<br /><br /> Doesn't anyone seem to think it's sad that even though the majority of the essays and &quot;real State of the Union&quot; speeches Vidal reprinted were from the '70's and '80's that nothing has changed? Even sadder, pathetic actually, is the fact that much of what Vidal predicted in those days (as a worse case scenario) has turned into fact (with the same pack of criminals coming back for repeat performances in the current junta)?<br /><br /> Gore Vidal is a historian and a republican par excellence. To use an empty &quot;argument&quot; that he's &quot;done more harm than good&quot; for this country is the height of ignorance. The only ones who have done this country harm are the politicians who take what they want for themselves and screw everyone else (forget the total disregard for the Constitution they swore to uphold).<br /><br /> Let's just hope Benjamin Franklin wasn't right when he &quot;once hinted, sooner or later every republic becomes a tyranny.&quot; (page 118)	2004-08-01

Other than that, let's see that person do what she did.<br /><br /> The only major gripe I have is that Barbara decided to use her car to get around. I think to get her point across more (not only to the audience but to herself) she should have switched to public transportation, since many members of the working class cannot afford their own vehicle.<br /><br /> Barbara is 100% correct when she says it's because of the low-wage jobs that the working poor work that the middle class and especially the upper class are able to enjoy low prices at Wal-Mart, a quick &quot;meal&quot; at a fast food joint, amongst other things.<br /><br /> The greatest injustice (and it's one that I've faced a few times in my search for entry-level clerical jobs) is drug testing. What I don't understand is how there's justification for drug-testing on someone wanting a $6 or $7 an hour job that means nothing to no one in the long run yet there's no drug testing for high level executives whose decisions affect the entire company. Let's see a high level executive in his three piece suit or her &quot;power suit&quot; have to strip nearly naked in front of a stranger and urinate into a plastic cup. Guarantee that's the day these mindless drug tests cease. (Actually, every executive should be drug tested and it should be a requirement that every politican be drug tested before entering office and randomly tested while in office.)<br /><br /> After reading this book, I do need to better myself. The figures she was mentioning in her book as being working poor are the same ones I made when I first got out of high school and I don't make that much above that today. (Something's gotta change.)<br /><br /> One thing she forgot to mention was how members of Congress (and city councils across the nation) continue to vote themselves incredible &quot;cost of living&quot; salary hikes every few years but fail to do that for the working class.<br /><br /> &quot;We can hardly pride ourselves on being the world's preeminent democracy, after all, if large numbers of citizens spend half their waking hours in what amounts, in plain terms, to a dictatorship.&quot; (page 210)<br /><br /> Couldn't have said it any better myself.few years but fail to do that for the working class.      &quot;We can hardly pride ourselves on being the world's preeminent democracy, after all, if large numbers of citizens spend half their waking hours in what amounts, in plain terms, to a dictatorship.&quot; (page 210)       Couldn't have said it any better myself.	2004-08-01

Gore is a true republican - someone who yearns for a return to the days when people and politicians actually paid attention to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  This includes worrying more about what's going on in our own backyards (besides trying to cancel out peoples' civil liberties) instead of putting military bases all over the world and having secret governmental agencies (who do not have to submit their budgets to Congress under the ever tiresome guise of \\"national security\\") overthrow governments they don't like (Guatemala and, more recently, Haiti, are prime examples).<br />On pages 152 and 153, Vidal accurately sums up present-day politics and the state of presidential elections: \\"He who can raise the most money to buy time on television is apt to be elected President by that half of the electorate that bothers to vote.  Since the same corporations pay for our two-party, one-party system, there is little or no actual politics in these elections.  But we do get a lot of sex.  Also, he who subtly hates the blacks the most will always win a plurality of the lily-white-hearted.  The word \\"liberal\\" has been totally demonized, while \\"conservative,\\" the condition of most income-challenged Americans, is being tarnished by godly pressure groups whose symbols are the fetus and the flag.\\"<br />And in case you're saying that Vidal's claims of Americans empire are hooey:  \\"Today, elsewhere, we have military presence in Bermuda, Egypt, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Panama, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc., not to mention all over the United States and our territories as well as two bases in Australia, one of which is a mysterious CIA unit at Alice Springs.  If all this does not constitute an empire, I don't know what does.\\"  (page 162)<br />Though written in 1997, Vidal proves to be a visionary (page 134): \\"Although the United States may yet, in support of Israel, declare war on 1 billion Muslims, the Europeans will stay out.  They recall 1529, when the Turks besieged Vienna not as obliging guest workers but as world conquerors.  Never again.\\"<br />As a die-hard Dem, I became very disenchanted with Roosevelt and Truman as I read about their back door antics during World War II and at the start of the Cold War (shame on you, Harry!).<br />It's time to end the misery and overthrow the never elected junta occupying the White House and get back to the Constitution and Bill of Rights.age 162)<br />Though written in 1997, Vidal proves to be a visionary (page 134): \\"Although the United States may yet, in support of Israel, declare war on 1 billion Muslims, the Europeans will stay out.

Towards the end of the book, Schlosser quotes a few slaughterhouse workers as saying they love the days when working on meat to be sent to the EU (European Union) because of the stringent standards they have long set into place.  The production lines move slower and more attention is paid to detail.  Corporate executives have outright stated that the American public simply doesn't care about how healthy the meat is, just so long as it tastes good.  (Naturally, the media continues to either bury such comments or not report them at all.)<br />There were no &quot;partisan&quot; leanings in Schlosser's book.  Eric merely stated the obvious time and again, something the American public needs to be reminded of: That the right-wing of the Republican Party is in the pockets of the meatpacking industry.  The millions (possibly billions) of lobbying dollars spent on these politicans have blocked the federal government from implementing more stringent safety standards regarding meat and have made these corporations *less* accountable for their less than ethical business practices of recalling contaminated meat.  We like to pride ourselves in this country that we're so ahead of the times yet it says a lot when corporations can voluntarily recall contaminated meat.  They are under no federal pressure to do so, and usually issue a recall after millions of pounds of the stuff has already been eaten (they have been times, as Schlosser reports, that these companies took bad meat returned by customers and simply reused it).<br />It says alot when the feds can recall defective toys and cars yet can't do anything when it comes to contaminated meat - meat that can harbor deadly diseases many years after you've had that delicious cheeseburger or Big Mac.<br />Before reading Eric's book, I was disgusted at the number of fast food &quot;restaurants&quot; that kept creeping up all over town.  At lunchtime, the choice was the same: McDonald's, Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts, Wendy's, or Popeye's Chicken.  While I was reading the book, I began to notice more than ever the workers behind the counter: Teenagers, minorities, immigrants who barely spoke English (which I'm seeing more and more of).  I saw how boxes with the food already made were being brought in to a franchise and all I could think of was, &quot;How long has that stuff been sitting in those boxes?&quot;<br />After reading about how corporate farms have run family-run farms out of business and how they treat those people like employees (disposable), after reading about how slaughterhouse workers are treated (badly injured workers forced to work right after they were treated for serious injuries, company nurses saying a worker had a sprained back when it was a herniated disk, a worker who had one arm amputated and was told by a supervisor, &quot;If the one hand doesn't work, use the other&quot;), after reading about how these corporate slaughterhouses are rarely held accountable for the deaths they cause, the harm they inflict on the general public, how they get away with advertising to little children (people who don't know any better and will beg their parents to take them to McDonald's because they don't know the consequences to their health from eating such food), how these corporations developed a &quot;cradle to grave&quot; advertising strategy, how they regularly supress freedom of speech when people dare question their business practices, I cannot, in good conscience, continue to support the fast food industry with my hard earned money.<br />I guess my body is following suit.  I went to a few fast food joints whilereading this book and got sick off their food and was amazed at how expensive the food was.  (You're spending the same amount of money in McDonald's that you would at a local diner).  I also cannot deal any longer with hearing these &quot;big&quot; people (usually in suits) belittling these fast food workers for making honest mistakes.<br />Becoming a vegetarian looks better everyday after reading this book.  I know one thing is for sure: I will support what little small businesses are left.  I'll spend a little more doing it, but I have never gotten sick from an independent company's food the way I have from fast food places.<br />Two enthusiastic thumbs up to Eric Schlosser for educating the American public about such a crucial issue.  On page 269, Eric reminds people that the power is still in their hands:  &quot;Nobody in the United States is forced to buy fast food.  The first step toward meaningful change is by far the cheapest: stop buying it. ... The heads of Burger King, KFC and McDonald's should feel daunted: they're outnumbered.  There are three of them and almost three hundred million of you.

Just listening to her, you could tell that, indeed, she was &quot;for real.&quot;  She has stated in every book - or the vast majority of them - that she simply does not believe in pretending to feel something that's just not there.  In this book, she stated that there are loads of film in production companies' wastebaskets with her saying, &quot;Nope.  Nothing here.&quot;<br />In this book, Sylvia explains the difference between ghosts and spirits.  Ghosts are souls who do not realize they're dead or don't want to face that fact.  Very often, they are seen on our level (eye-to-eye) because, technically, they are still on our plane.  Spirits, on the other hand, are souls who have made it to the Other Side and visit us (they are seen, according to Sylvia, three feet higher because their dimension is higher than ours).  Spirits do their part to warn us of impending danger, or some joyous event, or comfort us in times of deep grief and sorrow (many times, they visit us to let us know that they're alive and well on the Other Side and thinking of us).<br />She rehashes her favorite ghost stories and gives us updates on older ghost stories from previous books (for instance, Johnny Johnson in the Toys &quot;R' Us, who is still exactly where he was all those years ago).<br />The one thing that makes Sylvia stand out is the fact that she encourages people to be skeptic about everything (she admits she's one of the world's biggest skeptics), including all matters psychic.  A charlatan just wants you to believe everything, without question.<br />I enjoy and admire Sylvia's honesty, sarcasm, and sense of humor.  She has done her small part to make me understand the meaning of life and the fact that, indeed, there is life after &quot;death,&quot; and that life is eternal.	2004-03-22

Trumbo's message was powerful and poignant yet drowned out by the beat of war drums.<br />Though written in 1939, you can see some things just don't change (especially with the current atrocity in Iraq).<br />\\"You can always hear the people who are willing to sacrifice somebody else's life.  They're plenty loud and they talk all the time.  You can find them in churches and schools and newspapers and legislatures and congress.  That's their business.  They sound wonderful.  Death before dishonor.  This ground sanctified by blood.  These men who died so gloriously.  They shall not have died in vain.  Our noble dead.<br />\\"Hmmmm.<br />\\"What do the dead say?\\"<br />Trumbo very clearly gets his anti-war message across in the form of Joe Bonham, a 20 year-old who joined the Army to fight in \\"The Great War.\\" He was left a piece of meat after being hit by a shell in France (after waking from his coma, he struggles to determine if he's in England or France, neither location giving him comfort).  He's left without legs, arms, deaf, blind, a mask covering the spot where his face used to be.  Yet Joe lives, and the only thing he's got left is his mind.<br />Instead of having legs to run away from it all, arms to kill himself with, a voice to keep himself company, eyes to look around with, he goes through everything he's ever learned in his mind to keep himself occupied.  Sometimes, going over so much and asking so many questions about everything for so long makes Joe second-guess his sanity.<br />\\"He thought here you are Joe Bonham lying like a side of beef all the rest of your life and for what?  Somebody tapped you on the shoulder and said come along son we're going to war.  So you went.  But why?  In any other deal like buying a car or running an errand you had the right to say what's there in it for me?\\"<br />\\"And what's more mister are you as much interested in this liberty as you want me to be?\\"  (Translation: You're so gung ho about this war, YOU go out and fight it!)<br />With the current atrocity happening in Iraq, I couldn't help but think how some things never change when reading Chapter X.  It's the same old tired lines.  You would think that, with time, the pro-war folks would have thought of something new.<br />This book is heavy reading and is definitely worth it.  It WILL stay with you for a while after you've read it and much of what Dalton Trumbo wrote all those years ago still rings true.<br />\\"And now I lay me down to sleep my bomb-proof cellar's good and deep but if I'm killed before I wake remember god it's for your sake.  Amen.\\"ou want me to be?\\"  (Translation: You're so gung ho about this war, YOU go out and fight it!)<br />With the current atrocity happening in Iraq, I couldn't help but think how some things never change when reading Chapter X.

So much tragedy is packed into so little space but what's in those 187 pages will make you rethink about the little things in life we take for granted so much nowadays.<br />I always roll my eyes whenever I hear someone in a restaurant complain about their food or ask that a dish be prepared in a specific way (as if they're the king or queen of the universe).  At those times I always think of Europeans during World War II who had next to nothing and had to ration it to make it last for weeks.  With Mr. Szpilman's vivid descriptions of his drinking water that had bugs in it and foam at the top (loaded with bacteria) and drinking it as if it came straight from a well, I will have to really restrain myself in the future from telling people where to go when they have so much.<br />One thing that befuddled me was the notion that the Soviets were some kind of saviors, that they were better than the Germans (even Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, in his diary entries at the end of the book, bought into this when he stated that not even in the cellars of the Russian secret police was there a more efficient way of murdering people than the crematoriums near Lublin).  Not for nothing but more people died in Russia under Joseph Stalin than in Germany or Poland and Stalin's murderous ways made Hitler look like a choirboy.  The Russians could have cared less about Poland.<br />While reading this book, I also couldn't help but going back through conversations with people who rave about how the war years were so great.  I also get a kick out of the folks still around who sniff at the rest of us that THEY know what freedom is all about.<br />Americans went through nothing during the Second World War.  While people here were fox-trotting and jitterbugging and the women were flirting with servicemen at the local dance hall, European Jews were being crammed into cattle trucks saturated with chlorine (the scene from Roman Polanski's movie version of the book left a lasting impression with me), people were being shot on the streets of Poland, Germany, and everywhere else in Europe for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />Ask European Jews if 1939-1945 were the best years of their lives.<br />Personally, I don't know how Mr. Szpilman came out of the war with his mind intact.  His love of music got him through it all and saved his life in the end.  Most amazing of all, he didn't turn out to be a bitter man.<br />I hope Mr. Szpilman and Captain Wilm Hosenfeld are friends on the Other Side and I also hope to see Hosenfeld honored as a Righteous Gentile someday.<br />Speaking of Captain Hosenfeld, he turned out to be a visionary and was right on the money in so many ways.  Too bad he was on the wrong side of things (and sorry to see he met the death he did at the hands of the Russians.  Hitler got nothing next to him).<br />After reading this powerful book, I am thoroughly convinced that people my age (late 20's) don't know what it's like to struggle nor do we know the meaning of true survival.he book left a lasting impression with me), people were being shot on the streets of Poland, Germany, and everywhere else in Europe for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  <br />Ask European Jews if 1939-1945 were the best years of their lives.<br />Personally, I don't know how Mr. Szpilman came out of the war with his mind intact.

In the foreward, he stated that writing the book (author Moira Johnston helped him write it) was his way of dealing with the situation and moving on with his life.<br />Trevor is an ordinary guy who had a very high profile job.  It was because of circumstances on the job (that lead to what Trevor called &quot;an industrial accident&quot;) and the fact that he was in a car with the world's most famous woman that has put him center stage for the rest of his life.<br />I felt sorry for the entire Rees-Jones family as diary entry after another explained the turmoil going on inside each of them: His mother and stepfather's struggle to getting Trevor on the road to recovery, the whole family having to deal with the intense media pressure, having Trevor's professionalism called into question by so-called experts (that, in his own words, were not at the Ritz nor in the car), Trevor's having to cope with the fact that he was the only survivor, the family's having to deal with the first overprotective and subsequently vicious hand of Mohammed Al Fayed.  The list goes on.<br />I did get mad at, but then later understood, Trevor's wanting to keep his job with Al Fayed.  He was the textbook case example of a loyal employee.  Unfortunately, Mohammed Al Fayed was (and still is) so hung up on his conspiracy theories that he thought Trevor was lying to him about how much he remembered of the accident.  It was only when he (Al Fayed) was more forthright in wanting to take complete control of the investigation that Trevor had finally had enough and quit (his good friend, Kez, would also quit about two years after the crash for the same reason: He told Al Fayed to his face that he thought his theories were rubbish).<br />I give Trevor and his family (his real last name is just Rees but he changed HIS name to Rees-Jones because he was so in love with his now ex-wife Sue Jones) MUCH credit for coming through such a trying time in their lives not only intact but stronger than ever.  They did not let any of the media attention go to their heads (even as Trevor's so-called friends and even Sue were selling themselves to the highest bidder in the media).  They remained true small town folks to the end (and Trevor was even able to play his beloved rugby not a year after the crash).<br />Some folks may find this book boring as Trevor is a very down-to-earth chap who just shoots straight from the hip.  He doesn't trump up the facts (or make things up entirely as the media decided to do time and again while Trevor refused to give interviews).  He presents Diana in a very positive light and tells the unexciting truth about the goings on of the case and behind the scenes shananigans of one Mohammed Al Fayed.<br />Highly recommended (if you can still get it) for a first hand account of wha it's like on the other side of the camera and news reports.igation that Trevor had finally had enough and quit (his good friend, Kez, would also quit about two years after the crash for the same reason: He told Al Fayed to his face that he thought his theories were rubbish).<br />I give Trevor and his family (his real last name is just Rees but he changed HIS name to Rees-Jones because he was so in love with his now ex-wife Sue Jones) MUCH credit for coming through such a trying time in their lives not only intact but stronger than ever.

Same thing goes for when they encountered the blank stares of the natives.<br />The book paid for itself on page 132 when Giuseppe and Mark were in the Arberesh village of Spezzano Albanese and heard some guys in the store speaking in dialect.  When Mark asked them if they were speaking Albanian, one of the guys said, &quot;If you want to hear real old-style Albanian, you have to go to Lungro.&quot;  One line of my family is from Lungro and, upon reading that, I was so happy.<br />That's the best part about this book: How Mark went into detail about the rich cultural history of the Calabrese, a cultural history that is celebrated and revisited even when the young move to the north for work.<br />I share Mark's cultural dilemna in that I am also a &quot;half breed&quot;: An Italian father and a non-Italian mother (though mine's isn't French Canadian).  I, like him identify with the Italian side more than the &quot;other&quot; side.<br />Some people may not like this book (especially those who claim to be &quot;award winning writers&quot; yet have no books to their credit), but if they can do a better job, let's see it.o be &quot;award winning writers&quot; yet have no books to their credit), but if they can do a better job, let's see it.	2004-01-11

Though none of my family ever settled in the area, I was fascinated to read about the ethnic makeup of the different neighborhoods in addition to being treated to very rare photos from Skaler's postcard collection (which he has been assembling for the better part of 50 years).<br />He treats the reader to a thorough history of each neighborhood (or village, as it was formerly known) and goes into detailed explanation of the architecture of the houses that once stood in those areas (he rips architect H.E. Flower a new one for his design of rowhomes in the Parkside section of West Philly - homes that had their walls knocked down because the original homeowners weren't crazy about having to share a common stairwell).<br />A University of Pennsylvania graduate, Skaler did an excellent job in handling West Philly's history - from University City to 52nd Street.	2004-01-08

The continuous attacks on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) are so pointless and shallow that they can either make one laugh or just shake their head in disgust.<br />What makes this book such a \\"disappointment\\" is that Senator Clinton didn't attack Monica Lewinsky with gusto (she didn't attack her at all).  That's what the media and many people wanted: Juicy tidbits to trump up in the media.  She didn't sink to her adversaries' level of muckraking and that's what people don't get.<br />To frothing Clinton bashers everywhere: Take a moment and read her life's history.  The woman was raised a Republican (she even campaigned for Goldwater, for God's sake) and there's a nice photo in her book of her standing right next to future President Gerald Ford, among other key Republicans of the late-60's and early-70's.  She was also a proud president of Wellesley College's Young Republicans Club (until she realized her beliefs no longer reflected those of the Republican Party and resigned).<br />Bottom line: All those \\"scandals\\" of the 1990's were Republican manufactured and financed.  Senator Clinton's life is a lot less dark than those of conservative pundits.<br />It was an absolute pleasure to read this book and I'm proud to have it in my library.	2004-01-05

These aren't things that were pulled out of the air with no supporting documentation (or distorted).  Conason took conservatives' own words and sources (being the entire &quot;mainstream&quot; press) and used it to prove their bias.<br />I don't see where he had a &quot;vendetta&quot; against Nixon.  He has a case with the people who claim they are &quot;fair and balanced&quot; but who know they're anything but.<br />The chapter that stood out the most for me was Chapter 9: &quot;Faith, Charity, and the Mayberry Machiavellis.&quot;  Joe very clearly connects the dots between Bush, Cheney, etc. and these secretive, elitist organizations where Bush draws his radically conservative judicial nominees.<br />I was also fascinated to know that John Ashcroft is a medieval kind of guy.  I still can't get over the fact that his father used Crisco oil (!) to annoint him on the forehead before he was sworn in to one office because regular annointing oil was unavailable (in addition to his morning prayer meetings on federal - read secular - property).  To think that this is the guy who is supposed to defend religious and other civil liberties is enough to both frighten and sicken you to action.<br />I enjoy Joe's columns in The New York Observer.  He is a force to be reckoned with.	2003-12-16

Al practices something these right wing hacks think is beneath them, something that has become almost obsolete in modern day political discourse: Checking the facts.  Whenever Al had a question, he would simply pick up the phone and ask away (no matter what side of the political fence they were on).<br /><br />You can put his END NOTES to the test and they'd pass.  He doesn't just take the first thing he sees from Lexis-Nexus and distort it to conform to his parallel view of the world.<br /><br />Through his painstaking research (and that of the 14 members of TeamFranken), Franken refrains from stating that Democrats are the \\"true patriots,\\" refrains from calling Republicans and/or conservatives \\"idiots,\\" and while he peppers his commentary with sarcasm, it's not \\"vituperative.\\"  He doesn't make baseless, childish accusations about the people who do not share his political viewpoints.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed his chapters on Ann Coulter and his touching tribute to his friend, the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.  It was refreshing to get the truth about that \\"controversial\\" memorial from someone who was actually there and didn't just watch 2 minute clips on CNN and go on TV verbally assaulting everyone.  I also love the chapter about the \\"Blame America's Ex-President First Crowd.\\"  I'm sure that touched a nerve with frothing Clinton bashers everywhere.<br /><br />Once again, the right and their sheep have proven that they can dish it out but they just cannot take it.  We're very well aware that you people go through every positive review of a non-conservative book here at Amazon and give them negative ratings while repeatedly voting in the positive for Hannity, Coulter, O'Reilly, ad nauseum.<br /><br />This should be required reading for anyone who wants to know the scoop on the draft dodgers and elitists that compose \\"conservative\\" political commentators.	2003-12-16

Paul was on an even bigger quest: To find what value system the Southern Italian immigrants brought over with them.  He set out to tell the story from the Italian side of immigration, and I believe he did his job and then some.<br /><br />I was pleased that Paul was so forthright about the prejudice against Southern Italians by Northern Italians and the history of Southern Italy (some areas pre-dating the Roman Empire and Greek influence).  He tackled the subject tactfully and his and his subjects' honesty was a welcome breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Regarding various Italian settlements around this country: I was surprised to find out that there is an Italian settlement in Denver, Colorado.  I was a bit irritated that more mention was made of that and the settlements in North Jersey and New York and no mention whatsoever made of Italians in Philadelphia (besides South Philadelphia).<br /><br />In all, Paul did an excellent job of conveying the belief and value system of Southern Italians.  This book not only made me even more proud to be from the southern part of Italy, it has made me want to make that trip to my ancestral home (Calabria - provincia di Cosenza and Campania - provincia di Salerno), and experience my roots firsthand.	2003-07-14

Lawrence touched raw nerves when this was published because it vividly addressed and described what the upper classes have been doing for ages: Having extra-marital affairs with members of their own class and those of the \\"lower\\" classes.<br /><br />The book does have a few scenes of raw passion and thoughts but Lawrence was merely addressing how people feel in such affairs. He had the courage to put down those emotions into Oliver Mellors, the gamekeeper, and also Lady Chatterley herself.<br /><br />This IS a love story, when you get down to it. From an extra-marital affair there comes love, an awakening of the self (and in Lady Chatterley's case, a child). Apparently, more and more people in today's society are putting their desires first, otherwise, why the high divorce rate? (And the book was given much publicity when it was banned - so much so that this book couldn't land in peoples' hands fast enough. Many \\"illegal\\" copies were made and shipped to England and America, becoming an instant classic.)<br /><br />I give David Herbert Lawrence all the credit in the world to address sex in an age of absolute prudishness.

Dr. Weiss thought the poor woman had a temporary case of psychosis but upon doing research, he found proof of some of the details of the lives the woman had lived (and, no, she was NOT Cleopatra!).<br /><br />The best part of past life therapy is that after every method of \\"traditional\\" (read conservative) therapy has been tried and there are no results, past life therapy is used as a \\"last resort\\" and, many times, produces better results that enable the person to live a productive and positive life.<br /><br />I dusted this book off in a day and love rereading it from time to time.  It's heartening to read of a conventional doctor, his feet planted firmly on the ground, who discovered the wonders of past life regression therapy by \\"accident\\" and who champions it (complete with a set of ethics).	2003-05-06

Charles and Diana tried to make a p.r. show of togetherness on an overseas trip to South Korea shortly after the book's publication and failed miserably.  In December of that year, now-former P.M. John Major announced their separation in the House of Commons.<br /><br />This is an interesting read on the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and about as close as anyone ever got to writing an authorized biography of her life.  Only a few years after her death was it revealed that Diana, indeed, made audiotape interviews of herself spilling the Windsor's secrets and passed them to Morton through a third party (so he could never say he interviewed her).<br /><br />The pictures are very interesting and the information on the state of Charles's and Diana's marriage were indeed juicy.<br /><br />A great read.	2003-05-06

I have always had great respect for Native Americans with their high level of spirituality and closeless to the Earth.  Denise Linn is an excellent example of this.<br />Her book was and is exactly what I needed to open doors in my life.  Her exercises are excellent ways of not only finding out information about past lives but also, as the title suggests, finding out who you are in the present.<br />The best chapter in the book is \\"How To Recall A Past Life.\\"  You'll be surprised at what you find out.<br />Only a Native American could write a kick (butt) book like this.  It is most definitely worth the read!!!	2003-05-06

It was the height of the Catholic-Protestant feud that created much tension in Scotland.<br />Very interesting read and a must have reference book on Scotland.	2003-05-06

For instance, on page 71, there is a picture of the James M.E. (Methodist Episcopal) Church, on the corner of Haines Street and Belfield Avenue from 1890. This became the site of the famed Holy Rosary Italian Catholic Church in 1927.<br />I especially love the older, pre-Industrial Age pictures, when streets were unpaved and Germantown had yet to be really developed.<br />The Images of America series from Arcadia Publishing is a pictorial history of America's neighborhoods. The Germantown book is definitely worth buying and proudly displaying on your shelf.	2003-05-06

I wasn't 10 pages into his book and I had highlighted nearly everything he wrote.<br />While I am no fan of Timothy Mc Veigh's, I was able to gain an understanding of why he did what he did.  I still don't condone his actions but I understand his motiviations.<br />Gore's point about the current sad, sorry state of the US media was demonstrated for all the world to see when his book was actually banned after September 11 (while the country was inundated with typical, spiteful vitriol from the FAR right and that was deemed okay).<br />Gore urges this country to really take a look at itself and examine its policies.  It is these policies that have made us hated, a prime target for international hate groups.  It is innocent people like those in the World Trade Center towers who pay the price for these policies, not the beyond crooked politicians behind them.<br />He gives us 19 pages of military operations from 1949 to the present day.  THAT in itself is worth the price of the book.<br />Gore touched a very raw nerve and he makes loads of sense.	2003-05-06

I am seriously into genealogy and always believed there was a higher power that led me to information I would never have found any other way.<br />The naysayers can say whatever they want but there is no &quot;logical&quot; explanation that can explain how people found long sought for, critical information for their genealogical research by having a book come off the shelf and land on the floor to the page containing that information or how they picked up a book that they didn't give a second thought to and opened up the page to where the information was.<br />I had loads of fun reading this and highly recommend this book to people who think how they found some information was &quot;strange.&quot;	2003-05-03

He even gets into Reiki, a great way of opening oneself up to not only Spirit communication but a powerful meditation tool.<br /><br />BUT . . . he lost me towards the end with his thinly veiled criticism of Sylvia Browne. One minute, he's telling us that no one medium and their way is correct, which is absolutely true (and I completely concur with him when he said to run fast if you should ever come across any medium who claims the above) yet he goes on to criticize Browne (who he does not mention by name) and her methods several times in his book.<br /><br />He states that mediums are human and their prejudices will manifest themselves in one way or another (but not during their sittings/readings). That human bias was obvious while he was attacking other mediums' methods while agreeing with them in the end (i.e., the fact that some spirits need some time to adjust to their new state of being and it could take time - months or possibly years - before they come into contact with their loved ones still here on Earth).<br /><br />Robert does not believe in revealing the contents of his sittings but other mediums do that to demonstrate to people that they're not the only ones facing a particular situation (and they also change details about the person to avoid identification, which is something they must do).<br /><br />I was disappointed when he discredited some mediums yet held others in high esteem (like John Edward and James Van Praagh), while stating earlier on in his book that this was wrong. The one thing that stuck out for me was when he criticized \\"cold readings\\" (which is really guessing, when you get down to it) and that's the method John Edward is famous for (even though I do like him). I read Van Praagh's book, \\"Talking To Heaven,\\" and cannot get into his method at all. This isn't to say that Edward and Van Praagh haven't helped people or aren't doing good, that they most certainly do on a daily basis. I just didn't appreciate how he criticized some mediums for doing things he considered not up to par while his favorites are doing the same.<br /><br />He also lost me on two issues: Past lives and the Akashic Records. His arguments simply don't hold up against them.<br /><br />If you want to read this book, borrow it from the library or wait until it's deeply discounted.od, that they most certainly do on a daily basis.

A true historian and fierce researcher, Greg sure did his homework.  He interviewed many people including not only Sharon's family, friends and colleagues, but also Alice La Bianca (Leno's first wife), Janet Parent (Steve's sister), and others.<br />It was a joy to finally read a book focusing on the victims and not the so-called \\"family.\\"<br />I loved King's way of dedicating the first half of the book to Sharon's life, stopping a few days short of her death, doing the next part about the origins of Manson's \\"family,\\" and then bringing the two together to the horrible early morning hours of August 9, 1969.<br />The part that kept me spellbound was the chapter entitled, \\"The Last Day.\\"  It reminded me of Thomas Sancton's and Scott Mac Leod's book, \\"Death of a Princess: The Investigation\\" (about Diana, Princess of Wales).  Sancton and Mac Leod gave an almost minute by minute account of Diana's final hours in Paris on August 30, 1997 and King did basically the same with the goings on at Cielo Drive on August 8, 1969.<br />King gives the spotlight to the people who have been swept under the rug for the past 34 years: the victims.  He focuses primarily on Sharon but he does include little known or previously unknown facts about the \\"other victims.\\"  I say, \\"It's about time!\\"<br />This is the definitive book about the victims.  Vincent Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter\\" is THE account of the trial.  The two books compliment each other very nicely.	2003-04-29

In short, everything was still a mess.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for its unbiased reporting and also for the minute by minute account of Diana and Dodi's last day alive.	2003-04-29

Bugliosi goes into great detail about the mechanics of the case - the murders, the autopsies, how the LAPD almost blew the case because the detectives working on the Tate and La Bianca cases, at that time two separate investigations, would not communicate with each other, etc.<br />Bugliosi shows how he was able to link the two murders together, gather evidence that had almost been destroyed, and how he tracked down the gun that was used in the killings (which was filed away at the only precinct NOT to have gotten a county wide memo about the gun!).<br />There are updated versions of the book, marking landmark anniversaries of that black night in American history and I wouldn't doubt that Bugliosi will have another update for the 35th anniversary next year.<br />Helter Skelter is the book to have about the case. Greg King's \\"Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders\\" is the book to have about the victims (more specifically, of course, Sharon Tate).	2003-04-26

Discrimination continued to run rampant in the 1980's, when I was growing up.<br /><br />I grew up in a German and Irish neighborhood and nearly every time I tried to go outside and play I would be hassled and called names that I didn't understand. I could understand and feel her hurt, pain, and confusion when her Jewish girlfriend called her \\"that smelly Italian girl.\\"<br /><br />Maria was not being \\"whiny.\\" She was simply stating a fact of life. I love it when people tell Italians to get over the discrimination we faced and continue to face yet we are saturated with stories of how much the English discriminated against the Irish during the mass migration in the mid-1800's.  EVERY immigrant group's story of discrimination needs to be told so we can avoid the mistakes of the past and indeed \\"move on.\\"<br /><br />Maria's point of anything Italian being instantly Americanized was demonstrated with her own book. The original book cover had a lovely portrait of an Italian woman in native costume, but I guess that was too Italian, hence the generic present-day cover.<br /><br />This is a great addition to any ethnology student's collection.	2003-04-23

The story starts off slow but once it starts to pick up, it's a definite page turner.<br /><br />This is more of a psychological thriller than anything.  Sometimes you doubt that the Phantom is real but then something happens to make you second guess yourself.<br /><br />The ending was not what I had expected at all and I was a little disappointed with the timidity of Christine Daae.  Christine is one of the stranger characters in literature and I really expected her, at the end, to become one of the greats in opera but Gaston Leroux was not inclined to be conventional.<br /><br />A must have for every collection of classic literature.	2003-04-23

Susan Mc Dougal is one hell of a lady.  She faced horrendous conditions in prison, was shuffled from one federal facility to another without any explanation, and calmly held her own against the extreme agenda of \\"Independent Counsel\\" Kenneth Starr (a bedfellow of far right Republicans for years prior to the well financed Clinton witchhunt).<br /><br />Those that defend Starr would have done just swell in Auschwitz or Tiananmen Square.  Starr was unabashed of his tactics to make Susan testify (even sending an attractive lawyer to one prison to get her cooperation) and he wouldn't have missed the opportunity to nail Susan for perjury at the first opportunity, so she was stuck between a rock and a hard place.  She was screwed whichever way you looked at it and she knew it.  Susan was quite a few steps ahead of this creep and his band of misfits every step of the way.<br /><br />The saddest part of all is that when you ignore the talk radio gasbags and hysterics and actually read this woman's book, you will discover that she knew President and Hillary Clinton only slightly, and it was a relationship that occurred in the mid to late 70's.  She was not the close confidant of the Clintons that Starr portrayed her to be.<br /><br />To be able to come out of her situation mentally intact takes a lot of guts and fortitude.  Instead of dwelling over the past, Susan has taken her horrible experiences and has done well.  She holds no resentment towards Starr (who cancelled an appearance at a bookstore, if I remember correctly, when he learned Susan would be there) and has said that his day will come (oh, but to be a fly on the wall!).<br /><br />As another person said, Susan is not whiny or self-pitying in her book.  She just tells her story and lets you be the judge.	2003-04-23
