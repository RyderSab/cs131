This is the first time that I have been asked to review a book that is simply unintelligible. The trouble lies with the author's allusive, non-linear style, where rigour and clarity are needed. His writing style is so jumbled that it is impossible to tell what, if anything, he is getting at. The range of material he refers to is unmanageably vast, but he is a long way from being in control of it. Surprising connections are made, but he seems unable to think clearly about them. The result is pretentious and bizarre.<br />I note that the &quot;blurb&quot; on the dust-jacket makes no attempt to summarize what the book is saying, neither do the prestigious people who have provided endorsements. I suspect that neither they nor the publishers could follow the book any better than I could. There may be short-term puzzlement about how Routledge came to publish such an unsatisfactory manuscript but, beyond that, it will surely sink without trace.<br />With such an incomprehensible book, it is hard for a reviewer to begin to indicate what it is about, but one central idea seems to be that of &quot;live metaphor&quot;. There is no clear definition of the concept, but Gibson seems to be suggesting that much discourse in both cosmology and theology consists of &quot;live metaphors&quot;. There are indeed interesting issues about how these two disciplines are radically metaphorical in similar but non-identical ways. That, I suspect, is the issue that the author was trying to write about, but it can't be clarified by a book of this kind. I certainly cannot recommend it. - Fraser Watts, University of Cambridge	2001-10-05

When I heard that Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney had done a new translation, I decided that the time was nigh to tackle this epic tale.<br />Written in England sometime between the seventh and tenth centuries, the legend recounts events set in Scandinavia, where the hero Beowulf delivers the land of the Danes from a monster named Grendel. This edition presents the original Anglo-Saxon Old English text on the left-hand pages with Heaney's modern English translation on the right.<br />The cultures described in the poem have recently encountered Christianity, and the author reframes their mythic worldview in light of the Christian story. Grendel, as the embodiment of evil, is identified as a descendant of Cain. Beowulf's battle accounts are oddly Christianized; at one point he declares, &quot;I praise God in His heavenly glory that I lived to behold this head dripping blood.&quot; <br />But a surprising theme that emerges is the providence of God. Interspersed throughout the text are such affirmations as &quot;The truth is clear: Almighty God rules over mankind and always has.&quot; Beowulf compellingly portrays a primeval world of both brutality and heroism where paganism and Christianity intersect.	2001-08-17

The issue of predestination and free will is something of a perennial problem for Christians. Augustine and Pelagius tangled over it in the 5th century. Calvinists and Arminians have argued about it since Reformation times. Today the same struggle continues between two prominent authors, John Piper and Gregory Boyd.<br />Piper and Boyd, both pastors in the Baptist General Conference, take such different approaches to their theology that recently Piper attempted to have Boyd ousted from their denomination. Piper is a classical Reformed Calvinist, emphasizing God's sovereignty, foreknowledge and changelessness. Boyd believes what has come to be called &quot;freewill theism&quot; or &quot;open theism,&quot; maintaining that because God gives humans genuine free will, he doesn't necessarily know what we will choose to do.<br />Piper says that Boyd is denying a crucial divine attribute: God's omniscience. Because the freewill theist position says that God does not have full foreknowledge of human actions, the open view of God reduces God to a finite, imperfect deity.<br />Not so, says Boyd in God of the Possible. Boyd says that God's sovereignty and omniscience is not the real issue. Rather, what's in question is the nature of the future. Is it settled, or is it open? If it is truly open and dependent on free human choices to create it, then the future simply does not yet exist. <br />&quot;If God does not foreknow future free actions, it is not because his knowledge of the future is in any sense incomplete,&quot; Boyd writes. &quot;It's because there is, in this view, nothing definite there for God to know!&quot; So the &quot;openness of God&quot; view is more accurately about the &quot;openness of the future.&quot;<br />Boyd builds his case by surveying the Bible and showing that Scripture displays both a &quot;motif of future determinism&quot; and a &quot;motif of future openness.&quot; To highlight the latter theme, he notes passages where God is said to change his mind. In Genesis 6, God regrets having made humanity, and 1 Samuel 15 says God was sorry that he had made Saul king. After Moses pleads with God in Exodus 32, God changes his mind about destroying the Israelites. In 2 Kings 20, God tells Hezekiah that he will die, but then changes his mind and adds fifteen years to his life after Hezekiah pleads with him.<br />While these passages are usually interpreted as anthropomorphism by classical theists, Boyd says that they should be read at face value. He writes, &quot;The Lord himself tells us in the plainest terms possible that he intended one thing and then changed his mind and did something else.&quot;<br />Boyd also argues that the open view has positive practical implications for such things as petitionary prayer. If the future is foreknown and fixed, why pray? But if the future is open, then God can actually respond and influence future events.<br />The book concludes with a series of common objections to the open position and Boyd's responses. For example, Boyd's critics say that his view limits God within time, and that God is above or beyond time. Boyd responds that this concept comes more from Greek philosophy than from Scripture, and that the Bible itself portrays God as experiencing life sequentially and dynamically. <br />What is most attractive about Boyd's presentation is his relational picture of God. God is portrayed as having genuine give-and-take relationships with his people. God is not aloof and distant, as he often appears in traditionally cold, philosophical formulations of God. <br />But I wonder if Boyd is not thinking relationally enough. If God is infinite in wisdom, then he is perfect in his relational knowledge of his creatures. Because I know my wife pretty well, I can predict that she'll choose the cheeseburger over the crab legs any day. That doesn't mean I predestine her actions, just that I know her well enough to &quot;foreknow&quot; what she'll probably do. But my knowledge of my wife isimperfect, and she sometimes surprises me with her choices.<br />This is not the case with God. If he knows us perfectly, then he knows us well enough to anticipate our every decision. That doesn't have to mean that he coerces our choices as if we're puppets on strings. Our choices can be genuinely free. But his relational knowledge of us is so complete that he knows how we will respond in any given situation. Even if the future is open, God's foreknowledge and omniscience of that future can be complete.<br />Boyd concludes that the future is &quot;partly open and partly settled.&quot; The future is open enough that human beings have actual freedom to make responsible choices. Yet we can count on God to bring to completion all that he has promised, and nothing we can do will frustrate his divine plans.<br />Whether you are inclined to agree or disagree with his arguments, God of the Possible is an important contribution to the ongoing debate. Throughout Boyd is fair, even-handed and irenic. He provides strong biblical, theological and philosophical evidence to be reckoned with. His readable prose makes it an ideal introduction for those on both sides of the controversy.	2001-08-17
US	52967131	R33JP9SBTL02F2	1573221791	490178436	The Virgin of Bennington	Books	4	6	6	N	N	FaithWorks, July/August 2001	Poet Kathleen Norris is most known for her reflective meditations on the Christian life in her books Dakota: A Spiritual Geography, The Cloister Walk and Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith. So her latest book comes as quite a contrast. The Virgin of Bennington is Norris's memoir of her college and twentysomething years in the late 60s and early 70s, before she rediscovered Christianity.<br />Her title comes from her nickname as a na√Øve freshman at the Vermont liberal arts college. She moves quickly through her college years and spends most of the book recounting her experiences in New York as an assistant with the Academy of American Poets. This follows the familiar path of college, moving to the big city and getting the first job, but in Norris's able hands, the narrative is not only her own coming-of-age story but our universal story of encountering &quot;real life&quot; for the first time.<br />Norris was spiritually uncommitted during these years, and she is candid about her casual sex life and the drug use typical of the era, though never explicit or titillating. Others may cover similar ground in a therapeutic tell-all fashion, but Norris chronicles her past with deep poetic and literary sophistication. <br />While Norris's other books explore the spiritual life she now has, this book in contrast explores who she once was. Christians are sometimes conflicted about their pre-Christian life, falling into the errors of either overglorifying or denying a sinful past. Norris walks between these pitfalls and points to an appropriate role of memory and the importance of one's personal history.<br />Part of Norris's work at the Academy was to help New Yorkers understand their literary heritage, recapturing Walt Whitman's 1840's Manhattan or Langston Hughes's Harlem of 1926. This book is a similar recovery of the past, as she gives today's readers a compelling portrait of New York in the 1960s and 70s. This makes me wonder - thirty years from now, what will we remember of the 1990s or early 2000s? Things we now find mundane may hold great meaning to us later. Norris helps us realize that all times and places are filled with promise for those with eyes to see. <br />While the book starts out being about herself, much of it ends up being about Betty Kray, the executive director of the Academy. This gradual shift from autobiography to biography is an affectionate tribute to the influence of her mentor. It serves as a subtle reminder that young adults need older voices to help them find their way in this formative phase of life.<br />Norris also models the possibility of poetry as a Christian calling. She sees no conflict between the two worlds and is as conversant with 20th-century poets as with 4th-century saints. We would do well to follow her example and explore the riches of the arts and humanities, whether the work is particularly Christian or not.<br />Why should Christians be interested in this book? While she doesn't put things quite this way, her memoir follows the classic structure of fall and redemption. She begins in innocence, but soon slides into several affairs and a time of lostness and despair. <br />But grace is at work, even through a Manhattan literary scene ambivalent toward God. During a time of poetic dryness, her mentor encouraged her to take a literature class on 18th-century novels. There she rediscovered John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, which forced her to crack open a Bible. <br />&quot;Although I would have rejected this notion at the time,&quot; Norris writes, &quot;I now believe that God was there all along, present even in seeming absent.&quot; This memoir gives us hope that many of our peers, though they may now seem completely unaware of God, may yet be drawn toward him in unexpected ways.	2001-08-14

While struggling with a severe depression, she found solace in the rhythms of life she saw in the natural world around her. The cycles of darkness and light reaffirmed the fact that while this world is a fallen one, it is also one in which God provides hope and redemption.<br />Like nature writer Annie Dillard, Crosby is a keen observer of the environment, and her garden and the local arboretum provide much of the raw material for her reflections. The controlled burn of a prairie fire stimulates questions of human suffering. The birds squabbling at her feeder provide a lighthearted portrait of the church. A sleepless night reminds her that even the darkest hour brings hope of morning. <br />What is most refreshing is that unlike much contemporary devotional literature, Crosby allows the metaphors to speak for themselves, without belaboring the spiritual point. The voice she writes with reflects the Voice she hears through creation - subtle, gentle and profoundly stirring.	2001-08-14

This one is quite a bit more introspective than his others; having portions written from a first-person point of view lends itself to better character  development of that particular character, at any rate. But other characters  seem to lack development, and flipping between first and third person  points of view gives the book a slightly schizophrenic quality. Ultimately  the book succeeds more as a critique of the church and organized  Christianity and less as a spiritual suspense thriller. Moving in parts,  somewhat scary in others, but all in all a mixed bag.	1999-06-08

Sometimes I wonder if those of us who read series (especially long-standing series like Spenser) have unrealistically high expectations for each new book. I think the truth of the matter is that some books will be great and some will be just okay, and maybe a few will genuinely suck (though not too many, we hope). After all, who has a great year every year? Some are good, some better than others. That's just real life. And Parker's series seems to do a good job of replicating this aspect in Spenser's life. Some years have huge crises and brushes with death; others not much happens.<br /><br />This volume is one of the mid-level ones. It's okay, not bad, not great either. One aspect I think rather unrealistic is the idea that Spenser and Susan have been together for twenty years and have never talked about her past. In most dating relationships, this comes up in the first month. In some ways, perhaps this is Parker overcompensating for unduly neglecting this aspect of Susan's character in the past. He probably felt like he had to get it in sometime, and though it would have been more appropriate some ten or fifteen books ago, it's probably good that he got it in now.<br /><br />Parker has said that he doesn't have a favorite Spenser book; he feels like all of them are just episodes in an ongoing series and they sort of blur together. And maybe in this way, Spenser really reflects life. So if this book wasn't a dazzler, that's okay. That's just life.	1998-07-10

My take on this book is slightly different from all the others on this page. I think this book is disappointing because of its theology of marriage. The first book in the series demonstrated, rightly so, that Christian singles can live healthy Christian lives in challenging times without being married. The four main characters, all single, valiantly battle for the right, without becoming distracted by marital commitments. This seems to be in keeping with Paul's comments in 1 Cor. 7 about how it is better not to marry, especially when facing the end of the world.<br /><br />However, this book reverses all that. Two of the four protagonists fall in love with each other, and another meets and marries a minor character, who seems to have been invented only for the sake of providing a way for the other character to get married. In this book, confronting the evil of the antichrist takes a backseat to the loftier goal of falling in love and getting married. <br /><br />What's the underlying message of the book? That real Christians get married, while single Christians get killed. The authors have been captured by an evangelical focus-on-the-family theology that leaves little or no room for Christians who are single. They seem to promote the view that if you don't get married, you might as well roll over and die. Unfortunately, such a Christianity does not represent the biblical teachings of either Jesus or the apostle Paul, both of whom were single. <br /><br />Sadly, the comments about this book being nothing more than a formulaic romance novel are right on the mark. This book marginalizes singles, sets up unrealistic idealizations of marriage, and does not represent a balanced, biblical view that honors the value of both marriage and singleness.  END	1998-06-04

But for those with a keen literary eye, it delivers. I've been so disappointed with recent John Grisham novels that I found the weightiness and substantive content of this Turow novel very satisfying. <br /><br />I would agree with those who say that this book transcends the genre. This is no mere courtroom drama or legal thriller. It's really several novels in one; the flashback sequences to the 60s could even stand on their own. As a post-60s Gen Xer, I was intrigued with the seemingly eyewitness account of what life was really like back then.<br /><br />It is possibly true that this book may be a bit long. Yet I was so impressed with Turow's narrative voice and the authenticity of such a diverse cast of characters that it held my interest. A good deal of thought and research went into this one, and it really warrants a more thoughtful read than your average formulaic legal drama. Two thumbs up.	1998-05-26

On one level, this is simply the well-written tale of an English butler. On another, it is a Japanese author's allegory about the striking parallels between British and Asian society. The sense of honor, duty and dignity that Stevens carries is precisely what one finds in many Asian and Asian-American families, with characteristic traits of emotional restraint and self-sacrifical service. Ishiguro has found in England an analogy for the Asian culture he hails from.  <br />And yet this is a story with far wider application. It speaks a word of warning to the many workaholic Americans who spend their lives in professional pursuits at the expense of family concerns and personal growth. It also has ramifications for communication theory and interpersonal relationships. Very often the genius of the narrative is not in what the author says, but what is left unsaid, which the reader is left to intuit from the subtleties of the text.  <br />All in all, an amazing work - one of the few where both book and movie provide finely crafted dialogue and well-developed characterization.	1998-04-13

It starts out being fairly realistic. But the second half is increasingly unbelievable. The author sets up a technological utopia where poverty, disease, hunger, crime, and all other societal ills are nearly eliminated. The result is simply not credible. An external device like the truth machine does not necessarily provide a disincentive for criminal behavior. And far too many minor details are far too implausible (the elimination of paper books, underground subways traveling at Mach 3, and a couple that has sex at least once a day for two years straight). Sorry, but the author's imagination got a little carried away here.	1998-02-20

I've enjoyed many of Karen Kijewski's previous novels, and I think Kat Colorado is a solid character, much more interesting than V. I. Warshawski or Kay Scarpetta. (Nobody comes close to Kinsey Millhone, of course.) But this volume in the series seemed to fall flat for me. Several times I found my attention wandering; the plot didn't keep me interested and I found myself bored.  <br />One flaw with this book is that there are too many victims and not enough suspects. I guessed who the criminal was about halfway through the novel. It wasn't that hard to figure out, because by process of elimination, everybody else was either a target or too obvious to be the culprit.  <br />I find it interesting that the other reviewers of this book either loved it or hated it. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Kijewski's characters are strong enough to survive a weak plot; one can only hope that this book is an exception to an otherwise fine series.	1998-02-16

This book is not a bad read, but unfortunately it will be compared to Krauss's previous book, The Physics of Star Trek, which was a much stronger book. His sequel leaves something of the impression that he used most of his best material in the earlier volume. This book lacks the number of illustrations from the world of sci-fi and instead has more theoretical and technical exposition, much of which may be over the head of the lay reader.  <br />Also, readers (X-Files fans in particular) may be disappointed with the way in which the author seems to dismiss the possibility of such things as ESP and clairvoyance. Krauss goes to great lengths to explain why such phenomena are not probable or plausible, according to the laws of physics. But it is precisely because such things seem to operate outside the realm of physics that they have such interest and appeal.  <br />If anything, this book points to the limitations of physics and empirical science as a whole. Some things may simply lie outside the purview of science. Krauss tries to give scientific explanation to things which may more correctly belong to the field of the metaphysical, the supernatural, or the spiritual. In doing so, he demonstrates that science does not hold all the answers.	1998-01-20

This is a nice enough tale, though it doesn't soar to the previous heights of Calvin Miller's Singer Trilogy or Symphony Trilogy. It reads as a book within a book, with the odd effect of trying to provide pithy statements (a la 7 Habits) in the midst of a supposedly inspirational story.  <br />My main problems with this book are with Harper San Francisco's dreadfully poor job in editing and proofreading the book. I found at least a dozen typos and blatant errors in the book, including places where it speaks in third person in the middle of a first person narrative, occasions where the dialogue between characters is incorrectly attributed, and the anachronistic use of a modern Bible translation in a quote supposedly from 1903.  <br />Even more embarrassing, two of the three endorsements on the back cover have misspelled authors' names. Walter Wangerin is spelled &quot;Wagnerin,&quot; and Luci Shaw is referred to as Luci &quot;Shawa.&quot; All this indicates Harper's lack of professionalism and care in producing their books.  <br />Readers may find the fairy-tale ending a little too contrived. Ultimately, this book is a nice diversion for an evening of reading, but not a lasting contribution to contemporary Christian literature.	1997-12-17

Part corporate autobiography, part refutation of objections from Starbucks' detractors, this history of this successful coffee company details the ideas and values that helped Starbucks become what it is today. Schultz's enthusiasm for coffee (and for life) percolates throughout the book, providing a high-energy and seemingly caffeinated read.  <br />Most interesting in the book is the sociological analysis of why Starbucks has become so huge. The author suggests that Americans are starving for a &quot;third place&quot; apart from work and home where we can sit, converse, and build relationships. This yearning for community has been met in some small way by local coffeehouses and coffee bars across the country.  <br />Also fascinating are specific episodes such as the creation of Frappucino and the company's forays into markets such as coffee ice cream. In this the company demonstrates its remarkable ability to innovate and adapt its product without losing sight of its core business.  <br />In some parts, the author seems a little defensive, which is not surprising considering the attacks Starbucks has had to fend off in recent years. Schultz does an admirable job of providing the Starbucks side of the story, though many readers may suspect that this is little more than corporate P.R. spin control.  <br />Schultz's unbridled optimism may leave some readers feeling like the rags-to-riches story is yet another pipe dream available only to those rare entrepreneurs blessed with the inspiration, motivation and connections needed to make it in corporate America. What about the average Joe? The Starbucks success story is indeed remarkable, but whether or not Starbucks is the business paradigm for the next millennium is yet to be determined.	1997-12-16

Stephanie Plum is what Kinsey Millhone might have looked like if she'd grown up in New Jersey instead of Santa Teresa. While to some degree Evanovich seems like another Grafton copycat, she has enough originality and style to have her own voice. I'd rank Stephanie Plum on par with Karen Kijewski's Kat Colorado and slightly above Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski, but Kinsey Millhone is still the female P.I. queen.	1997-11-24

This excellent book provides keen literary analysis of a popular detective mystery series, something most elite literary snobs would never condescend to do. But Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone mysteries shine far above and beyond the rest of the pack, and this book explains why.  <br />Fully the first three-fourths of the book provides a detailed biography of Kinsey, her background, her personality traits, her setting, her work, and her values. Only the last few chapters are actually about Grafton, but we readers sense that we have already gotten to know Grafton's sensibilities through encountering her alter ego. The authors do a remarkable job of suggesting why Grafton's novels have become so popular, noting that she has elevated the genre from mere &quot;whodunit&quot; to providing coherent psychological depictions of why someone might have committed a crime.  <br />The book is filled with quotes from the novels, all of which are carefully referenced. One imagines that the coauthors might have made their notes from the books on little index cards and rearranged them to make sense, just as Kinsey would have.  <br />Most fascinating were the chapters where the authors assess Grafton's writing style and overall themes, arguing that the series is wrapped around the general theme of &quot;the harm families do.&quot; They isolate specific examples illustrating Grafton's stellar literary excellence, demonstrating that she transcends the confines of the genre and should be acknowledged as one of the great contemporary authors, not only of mysteries, but of any fiction.  <br />I rarely buy a book at full price (even at Amazon.com's discounts :-) but this one was well worth it. It is an indispensable companion to the series. Kaufman and Kay have done Grafton's fans a remarkable service. We can only hope they will write a sequel once Grafton completes &quot;N&quot; through &quot;Z.&quot;	1997-11-24

I've recently finished reading the complete corpus of Robert Parker mysteries and novels, both Spenser and non-Spenser, and I was happy to find an autographed copy of Night Passage at a local Borders. There is much in common here with Parker's other work, of course, since it is, after all, penned by the same author.   <br />What Parker achieves in this new novel is something of a middle ground between his Spenser series and his stand-alone novels such as All Our Yesterdays. It is somewhat refreshing to hear Parker employ the third person point of view in his narrative. This enables us to see a mystery unfold from various perspectives, not just the detective's. Furthermore, the initial section of the book chronicling Jesse Stone's cross-country trek from L.A. to Paradise is a fine introduction to the character; it achieves almost an Odyssey in reverse.  <br />While Stone is no Odysseus (or Spenser, for that matter), he is his own person, and Parker is to be commended for his efforts to break new ground and explore new themes. Granted, this is difficult to do after a career encompassing several decades, but Jesse Stone is an admirable character which should open up a new universe of plotlines to explore. In some sense, Jesse Stone is playing Picard or Janeway to Spenser's Kirk. Let the adventures continue.	1997-11-13

I skimmed past most of the jargon, since it had barely anything to do with the plot. Every once in a while I'd stop and tell my wife, &quot;This is a dumb book. It's boring and slow.&quot; And she'd say, &quot;So stop reading it.&quot; And I'd reply, &quot;Nah, I have to find out what happens.&quot; And perhaps that summarizes Crichton's skill, to be able to write engaging mediocrity. A stellar example of pop fiction--brain candy, an okay distraction from real life, better than a made-for-TV-movie but instantly forgettable.	1997-10-23
US	52967131	RS4SWB3V6X265	0440146291	180611610	Love and Glory	Books	4	82	86	N	N	Is this Robert Parker's autobiography?	This book is one of Robert Parker's few non-Spenser novels, though the protagonist has some sort of family resemblance to the Boston gumshoe. Like the Spenser novels, it's told in first person narrative and makes plenty of literary references. There's a friendship with a black man who boxes (like Hawk), and the girl eats fastidiously (like Susan). Much of the book takes place at Taft University, a fictional college that was the setting of Parker's Spenser novel Playmates.  <br />But what's most interesting about this book is that the protagonist describes his experiences as a writer and his work on a doctorate in English literature. At this point the character has less in common with Spenser and more in common with Robert Parker himself. One is left wondering if through this novel, Parker has given his readers more of an autobiographical glimpse of his own life and literary career.	1997-10-15

This book has generated comparisons with Jane Smiley's &quot;Moo.&quot; But it reminded me more of Jon Hassler's novels about academic life, &quot;Rookery Blues&quot; and &quot;The Dean's List.&quot; While fairly satisfying, Russo's style and tone left me wanting. If you enjoyed &quot;Straight Man&quot; but want something even more insightful, funny and poignant, try Hassler.	1997-10-13

The legal thriller genre has been overshadowed by the Grishams of the land, unfortunately obscuring some very skilled writers like William Bernhardt. This novel begins as a courtroom drama but soon develops into a fast-paced chase plotline a la The Fugitive. There's an edge here that Grisham seems to have lost; readers disappointed by Grisham's latest overly planned-out novels will find a fresh sense of recklessness, uncertainty and spontanaeity in Bernhardt. Well-written, deft characterization, and satisfying plot twists. Two thumbs up	1997-08-25

I started this book at 11 p.m. and finished it by 1 a.m. Gripping read, strong characters, though perhaps not enough supporting cast (at least, my feeling at the end of the book was that there weren't enough survivors). Maybe the only fault is that some of the &quot;scary&quot; parts seemed scripted more for a Monday night TV movie than for a real psychological thriller	1997-08-19

I read the book before reading any of these reviews, and I admit I agree with many of the critiques of the book's plot, characterization and unsatisfactory ending. Upon reflection, however, I wonder if Grisham is driving at a different message.<br /><br />Consider the issues he's taken on in previous books: A Time to Kill was a statement against racism, The Chamber was his argument against the death penalty, The Rainmaker challenged the health insurance industry, and The Runaway Jury took on big tobacco. But this book doesn't have a real villain, at least not in some institutional form. The only thing that motivates all the main characters is the cry, &quot;Show me the money!&quot;<br /><br />And here is perhaps the thrust of the novel. Grisham explores the corrupting power of greed, evidenced through lawsuit and litigation. No one is immune. Lives are shipwrecked and ethics are compromised because of the seductive desire for untold millions. Even those we believe to be noble are not above selling out their closest loved ones.<br /><br />Though part of me desperately wanted a different ending, it serves as a striking commentary on utter emptiness of those whose ultimate goal is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It also reminds us once again that the best laid plans of mice, men and even Grisham heroes go aft agley.	1997-08-18

Having probed the religious impulses of the post-boomer generation in Life After God and profiled the techie-geek subculture in Microserfs, Coupland now offers a series of short essays about the Deadheads and the lingering neo-hippie subculture of the 1990s.  <br />However, only one-third of the book is about the Dead. The second section are snapshots of various people and places, ranging from young politicos in Washington, D.C., to musings on post-Communist East Berlin and the architectural landscape of Vancouver. The third section is devoted to a socio-philosophical analysis of the Brentwood community and its residents from Marilyn Monroe to O. J. Simpson. Here he provides his keenest observations on the poverty of wealth and celebrity, something like a Gen X version of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.    <br />While introducing several interesting themes regarding the nature of identity in what he calls a culture of &quot;denarration,&quot; the reader senses that Coupland's latest outing is merely a hodgepodge of his random thoughts and observations. This book lacks the thematic coherence of his earlier works, primarily because this is a collection of articles and essays rather than a novel. The quality of his material varies widely from chapter to chapter, as if illustrating his own struggle to portray life as a narrative. This book, like life in general, has its good and bad days. Worth reading, but not Coupland at his best.	1997-08-04

Lewis & Aldous Huxley	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A fascinating &quot;what if?&quot; debate about life and beyond.	John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, and Aldous Huxley all died on November 22, 1963. What if they all met after death, somewhere between heaven and hell? That's the premise of this engaging and intriguing book by philosophy professor Peter Kreeft.  <br />Written in the form of a Socratic dialogue, Kreeft's book casts Lewis as a Christian theist, Kennedy as a modern humanist and Huxley as an Eastern pantheist. The three interact and challenge one another's worldviews, examining and testing each other's beliefs to see what is true about life after death and the meaning of life.     <br />This book is ideal to read with a few other friends, be they believers, skeptics or seekers. It will provide lively discussion and ample food for thought.	1997-08-04

Try Calvin Miller's Singer Trilogy, an allegorical retelling of the New Testament in three movements. Book 1, The Singer, is a depiction of the life of Christ. Book 2, The Song, describes the spread of the gospel by the early church. And Book 3, The Finale, looks forward to the end of history and God's ultimate triumph over evil.<br /><br />Miller achieves something few contemporary Christian fiction authors even attempt--poetic prose akin to Lewis or Tolkein, with the theological insight and literary style of Milton or Bunyan. His narrative is moving, compelling and breathes with artistic power. Peretti has got nothing on this.	1997-08-04

What would happen to Christianity if archaeologists discovered Jesus' body? That's the premise of this well-written, engaging story.  <br />The author evidently did substantial homework in order to write this book. The descriptions of the painstaking archaeological work show careful research and attention to detail. Biblical scholars will enjoy the material on textual analysis, and those who question the historicity of Christianity will find compelling data and evidence for at least some degree of belief.     <br />Unlike most Christian fiction, this novel has no sense of &quot;preachiness.&quot; While some plot twists are a stretch, the storyline is no less credible than a Grisham or Grafton. It's simply a well-told tale that raises interesting issues and suggests some answers.	1997-08-04

As a displaced Minnesotan, I always enjoy revisiting my home state via the novels of Jon Hassler. Like coming home for the holidays, this book evokes the mixed emotions of anticipation and disappointment, the joy and frustration of renewing relationships with the relatives, and the uncomfortable reality that time takes its toll on the ones we love.  <br />Hassler fans will find in The Dean's List another enjoyable trip to the now-familiar small town of Rookery. But this book is unlike its predecessors in that it may be Hassler's last outing to the Badbattle River valley. Readers may not know that Hassler has Parkinson's disease. And the awareness of his mortality seeps through the pages of this book.    <br />While all of his books are to some degree autobiographical, we see in The Dean's List a greater sense of authorial self-revelation. Leland Edwards, the Icejam Quintet alumnus and now dean of the college, is a frustrated academic-turned-administrator struggling to keep his school above water. He encounters his hero, Richard Falcon, a Frost-esque poet working on his magnum opus. Edwards decides to revitalize the good name of Rookery State by bringing the esteemed poet to campus for a rare reading.    <br />Little does Edwards know that Falcon has his own struggles, not the least of which is the onset of Parkinson's disease. And in these two characters we get a glimpse of Jon Hassler's own plight. Both Edwards and Falcon--and Hassler himself, we might surmise--are fighting to achieve a sense of purpose, meaning, accomplishment and lasting significance at a point in their lives where the clock is ticking and the odds are against them. Will they achieve their goals? Will they complete the tasks that lie before them? And will they be remembered when they are gone?    <br />It is these elements that make this novel an intriguing read. True, it lacks some of the power and beauty of his earlier novels--but this too, is illustrative of the trauma we experience as we approach the end of life. Can we find meaning and significance in our midlife and waning years? This novel provides insights well worth contemplating, from one who well knows what it feels like to be there.	1997-08-01
