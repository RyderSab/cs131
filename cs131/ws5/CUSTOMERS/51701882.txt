Therefore, we see the catechism as a book for children, not for all Christians, as if it were like most other schoolbooks: something to tolerate until graduation and then discard as refuse.  To this Arand writes a scholarly, refuting tour de force.  Instead, Arand shows us through his well-researched book that we should see the catechism as an \\"owner's manual,\\" for it contains more than information on what to know, but how to live.<br /><br />In chapter two, Arand shows that not until the 16th century did the term \\"catechism\\" become linked with only a formal instruction in the faith for confirmation.  Throughout the history of the Church, catechetical instruction has taken place in sermons, confessional manuals, prayer books--besides formal instruction.  Even preaching incorporated the catechism, for sermons and the catechism both go to the heart of the Christian faith.<br /><br />In chapter three, Arand really shines.  There he shows that Luther wrote his catechisms to be with the Christian from baptismal font to grave.  That the Small Catechism remain with a Christian, Luther designed that it be internalized at three levels.  First, Luther wanted the catechism to be learned.  For this to happen, he specified three tiers where children would be taught: Parents took the primary role, with pastors and government taking on auxiliary functions.  Luther wrote the catechism for memorization (in the German) for a largely illiterate culture; thus, he used alliteration, assonance, repetition, strong verbs, and concrete nouns.  Second, Luther wanted the Catechism to be understood.  To aid this level of knowledge, he employed a series of questions and explanations, the most common being, \\"What is this?\\"  Third, Luther wanted the Catechism to take root in a person through meditation and continual relearning of the Catechism.  Such a third level of learning would keep the Christian centered amid the travails of life.<br /><br />In Chapter four, we learn that even the arrangement of Luther's Small Catechism carries meaning!  The Small Catechism's order has a dynamic that is theologically significant, because each chief part of the Catechism must be read and interpreted in light of the whole.  Luther's ordering of the Catechism is the Law-Gospel rhythm of Christian life--and part of catechesis itself.  The Catechism's shape is the shape of the Christian life.  First, we are brought to repentance by knowing our inadequacy to meet God's demands (Ten Commandments).  Yet, through the life-creating Word (the Creed), faith is worked.  Next is our response to God: Prayer (the Our Father).  The Catechism presents the doctrine of the Gospel in its fullness with its chief article--justification--at its center.  The life of the Christian shaped by the Catechism is one that uplifts God's gifts, not human works.  In the structure of the Catechism, we see Law and Gospel correctly ordered and treated, and the response of faith, prayer, taught is a way that is rooted in God's word.  By learning the shape of the Catechism, we learn the shape of the Christian life: one of continual repentance and yearning for God's life-giving Word and Sacraments.<br /><br />Finally, Arand brings to light how Luther's Small Catechism can help Christians live the life of faith.  For faith is no mere adjunct of Christian living; it touches and influences every aspect of life.  Luther's Small Catechism concentrates our attention on faith and then shapes our living with a worldview flowing from faith.  The first section (the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer) shows a Christian life as it is lived out in faith.  Only by relying on God can one use his possessions properly; thus, the Creed and the Our Father help the Christian keep the Ten Commandments!  The second section (baptism, absolution, and the Lord's Supper) hones in on three foci of worship and how they nourishfaith-life.  For the Word of God works through various forms and effects what it says--it is not mere information.  The final section (Daily Prayers and Table of Callings) establishes how Christians live out their faith in their daily lives, for the doctrine of faith centers the Christian on God's gifts in every sphere of life.<br /><br />When we see the catechism as an \\"owners manual,\\" it helps shape and inform our lives--also making us a better \\"second text\\" from which to interpret all aspects of faith-life: how to interpret the written Word, how to serve our neighbor out of faith.  The Catechism's brevity makes it easily meditated over, helping open an entire world where faith informs and shapes all that we do.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.ey nourish faith-life.

He is part of a second-generation of Luther scholars who have followed in the footsteps of Joseph Lortz.  Lortz, also Roman Catholic, understood well the condition of the late-medieval church and saw Luther as a theologian who was still part of the catholic faith tradition.  However, Olivier (including Albert Brandenburg, Peter Manns, Harry McSorley, Otto Hermann Pesch, and Jared Wicks!) has gone one step further: he does not so much compare Luther to find out where he has remained or departed from the tradition of Roman Catholicism.  Instead, Olivier seeks to understand Luther by studying specific aspects of his theology, relate him to other leading theologians like Aquinas, and advocates receiving Luther's theological insights that are still relevant.  Such a Luther-friendly, Roman Catholic theologian now sees Luther as part of a common Christian tradition--and is even willing to call him a \\"father in the faith\\"!<br /><br />A translation of La Foi de Luther, Olivier has organized Luther's Faith into seven chapters, the first five of which focus on Luther, how he developed his theology, and what the core of that theology is.  Chapter 6, \\"What Kind of Reformation,\\" is exactly that: what kind of Reformation did develop in the theological, cultural, and sociological milieu of the 16th Century.  The book's final chapter, Olivier then looks into the Roman Catholic response to the Reformation and, thus, its continuing repercussions.<br /><br />The book's main thesis is that Luther was not some wild heretic outside the catholic faith, but operated well within the tradition of the Church catholic and fought many corruptions that needed correcting.  While operating within such traditions and norms, Luther brought to the fore the true Gospel: the proclamation of the forgiveness of sins because of what Jesus has done, which is grasped by God-given faith.<br /><br />Then why has it taken so long, well into the late 20th century, for some Roman Catholic theologians to speak so forthrightly?  Olivier implies the bureaucracy of the Roman Catholic Church did not look at the theology of Luther on its own merits but more from the context of organizational preservation.  Thus, in her Council of Trent, the Roman Catholic Church defined herself dogmatically in a way that further contributed to the split within Christendom.  Thus, the Church focused her energies on trying to maintain authority and outward unity, and in the process, refused to see the good in many of Luther's theology and reforms.<br /><br />Although I cannot concur with all of Olivier's views, I was taken aback by how favorably he views Luther!  I believe he goes awry in a couple of areas, but such foibles are minor in the broad scope of the book.  For example, concerning the theology of the cross, Olivier writes: \\"His [Luther's] theology of the cross was really discovered only in the 20th century\\" (Pg. 120).  Such a statement is simply wrong.  Luther's theology of the cross has had a renaissance among some theologians as of late, such as Alister McGrath and Gerhard Forde, but to say is it was \\"discovered\\" is incorrect.  In addition, Olivier's definition hardly does the concept justice: \\"At stake was a theology other than the current one, a new way of speaking about faith, which Luther called the theology of the cross: `of the cross' because it was on the very fact of the cross, of the Crucified, that his thought was fastened\\" (Pg. 118).<br /><br />Olivier's copious quotations also benefit his book.  If I have one complaint in this area, it is that I wish he included more from Luther's commentary of Galatians and less from his commentary of Romans, which is less theologically developed.  Last, the book is slightly dated in two areas.  Olivier's mentioning of Europe being fascinated with Marxism fell the way of the Berlin Wall.  Also, I think hindsight has shown that the hope Olivier has put into reforms like Vatican II for Roman Catholicism have not borne the fruit that he would have wanted concerning Luther.<br /><br />Yet the few minor quibbles I have with Olivier do not ruin the splendid work that he has written.  The book is full of Luther quotations, but not simply to fill up space; no, they support the statements that Olivier makes.  Other areas show that Olivier truly tries to take in Luther in contrast to the traditional Roman Catholic view of him as a \\"heretic\\": \\"Luther's errors have been exploited [by Roman Catholics] to the point of absurdity. . . .  Rome is not always up to acknowledging that the Reformation is its Damascus Road: `I am he who you are persecuting.'  Luther, indeed, was not a heretic like the other.\\"  (pg 73)  Olivier even sounds Lutheran (or should I say \\"evangelical catholic\\") when he opines, \\"The church has no other `power' than the Word of the Gospel.\\"  (pg 167)<br /><br />Of all the chapters in the book, I found the last chapter, \\"The Faith of the Papal Church\\" the least likable.  Olivier has a big-tent, agree-to-disagree theological worldview.  I think that Olivier would even welcome Lutheranism back into Catholicism without ironing out the theological differences between us; Lutheranism would simply be a wing of Roman Catholicism like the Augustinian or Dominican orders.  Nonetheless, I cannot recommend his book highly enough.  I do not recommend the book simply because it casts Luther in a good light--but that it takes a more-objective view of Luther within the context of the Church catholic.  Olivier brings out why the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century was unable to respond to Luther's Gospel rediscovery as she should have.  Such historical insight can only help others (and Lutherans) to understand Luther better and remove centuries old biases built on falsehoods and distortions.  Such honest, historical-theological works like Olivier can only benefit true ecumenism and help a divided Christendom understand herself better in this vale of tears.as put into reforms like Vatican II for Roman Catholicism have not borne the fruit that he would have wanted concerning Luther.

US	51701882	R8O6SIKWYFDB6	0806645733	363834274	Martin Luther: A Life	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Well researched and written	James Nestingen graduated from of Concordia College, Moorhead, Minnesota in 1967, earned a master of divinity degree from Luther Seminary in 1971, and the master of theology degree in 1978.  In 1984, He received his doctorate in theology from St. Michael's College, University of Toronto.<br /><br />Following his ordination in 1971, he served as a parish pastor for two congregations.  In 1980, Nestingen returned to Luther Seminary as a professor of church history.  Today, he is part of a renewal movement with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, trying to return his church body to its confessional roots.<br /><br />At first look, Nestingen's book appears as nothing special: the book is cheaply bound and the print is too small.  However, do not let such dissatisfiers dissuade you from reading this book.  Like some other recent Martin Luther biographies, Nestingen tries to get the reader to understand the man Luther and his theology.  Nestingen mostly succeeds.  If I can say anything negative about this book, it is this: it is too short to flesh out his thoughts and put Luther more in context within his medieval, historical surroundings.<br /><br />Luther: a Life takes more dedication to read than, perhaps, what is considered (and rightly so) the current-day standard of Luther biographies: Kittleson's Luther the Reformer.  Nestingen delves more deeply into Luther's mind and theology, yet skimps on covering some historical events that were simultaneously taking place.  Although Nestingen's theological explanations are needed to understand Luther, they are never discussions merely to impress, or are they off-putting.  However, Nestingen puts the reader in the precarious position of filling the depth, shadows, and color of much of what takes place in Luther's life.<br /><br />Starting chronologically, Nestingen glosses over Luther's early life and does not slow down to delve deeper until Luther becomes a monk.  But as he digs deeper, one begins to see the rich deposits stored in Luther's mind that Nestingen brings to light.  Nestingen describes the Christian life as \\"a dance of dying to Christ in the crucifixions of everyday life to be raised with him to newness of life--life in faith\\" (pg. 23).  The very next page, Nestingen proclaims the purpose of preaching within the Church: \\"[it is] not merely to communicate information or to appeal to people's wills, but actually to give the gifts and benefits of Christ Jesus.\\"  Oh, what joy to read from a man who truly understands Luther!<br /><br />But Luther the man and theologian is not one so easily grasped.  Nonetheless, Nestingen in short order opens a door to a way of thinking that we living in the 21st century do not naturally have: we contend for the \\"golden mean\\" or the ideal, middle ground.  Yet, Luther worked within a dialectical world--a world of seeming opposites.  Nestingen writes, \\"Truth comes out of the dialectic, that is, from the way in which two extremes butt up against one another to limit or to establish each other\\" (pg. 35).  Luther \\"is paradoxical, so that it often seems as though he is contradicting himself, saying one thing in one situation, something completely different in another\\" (pg. 36).<br /><br />On Luther's \\"Gospel discovery,\\" his \\"tower experience,\\" I agree with Nestingen (and Lohse) that it probably coincided with his name change from Luder the Luther, \\"a small change based on the Greek word for freedom, elutherius.  I see the similarity as too exceptional simply to explain Luther's name change as merely a respelling from Low/Middle German to High German.<br /><br />As Luther aged and chaos began to rule in much of Germany, Nestingen brings out more than other biographies the strain it took on Luther and Melanchthon's friendship.  Nestingen also revisits that strain renewed in their theological differences well into 1530s and 40s (pgs 92-93).  In addition, Nestingen uses enough pages to show clearly what was at stake in the debate between Erasmus and Luther on human free will.  I found his treatment of the Peasants' War especially balanced; he shows Luther's efforts of trying to bring peace and order, but how poor timing and excessive blustering brought his efforts to nothing (pgs. 57-58).<br /><br />Chapter 6, \\"Luther at Home: Refuge from Chaos,\\" shows Luther the family man, focusing on the relationship between Luther and Katie.  If it were not for Katie, Luther would probably have given everything away.  Katie was a strong and astute household manager, and perhaps, at times, proud.  But Luther and Katie loved each other dearly.  Luther's letter to Katy on February 10, 1546 had me cackling with laughter at the banter they shared as husband and wife.<br /><br />When Emperor Charles V commanded the Lutheran princes to explain their beliefs, Nestingen gets under the surface and shows what took place for the Augsburg Confession to become a reality.  \\"Consulting the Marburg Colloquy, [Melanchthon] edited the Schwabach Articles. . . .  He then added three articles of his own . . . [and] finished the work on liturgical matters begun at Torgau\\" (pg. 85).  Eventually, he even shows how the Emperor's reluctance to tolerate the Lutheran churches led to the eventual state-churches in Europe.<br /><br />Martin Luther: a Life shows well the chaos that the Reformation had wrought by the late 1530s.  \\"Luther's old friend Agricola had turned on him and left town.  The Swiss were blocking an agreement on the sacrament [of the Lord's Supper].  He had given up on councils . . . the emperor was poised to make good on his threats\\" (pg 100).  By 1545, Luther was so tired of his fellow Wittenbergers' moral laxity and abuse of the Gospel that he, in effect, went on strike.<br /><br />Martin Luther: a Life is an admirable book, primarily weakened because its length is too short to do full justice to the sweep of Nestingen's look into Luther's life.  If the book had more supplementary information to paint a fuller palette--and had a proper binding and text size!--this book could surely supplant Kittleson's as the biography of Luther to read.ween Erasmus and Luther on human free will.

US	51701882	R347FW8LNUBHSB	0670032727	826778739	Martin Luther: A Penguin Life (Penguin Lives)	Books	4	107	114	N	N	Excellent, but use as a supplementary text	In November 2000, Penguin Group approached Martin Marty to write a biography on Martin Luther.  He agreed and approached such a biography with no set agenda or niche he wished to fill that other biographies had left fallow.  Yet throughout the book, one finds Marty talking about Luther as a Jacob (from the Old Testament account of Jacob wresting with God by the Jabbok River), as one who wrestled with God his entire life.<br /><br />On one level, I found Marty's biography a complete joy to read.  It straddles the fence between a theological development of Luther like that of Althaus or Lohse and a chronological, easy-to-read biography like that of Roland Bainton.  This middle ground of Marty's book turns out to be a glowing success--but in a few ways, also a gloomy failure.<br /><br />Marty succeeds getting into the mind of Luther as no other easy-to-read biography does.  Early in the book, he highlights more than others do the influence on Martin Luther by Usingen and Trutvetter, two professors of Luther who were followers of Ockham.  It was probably through them that the Sola Scriptura principle was planted into Luther's mind, which lay dormant until his struggles with Roman Catholicism forced that seed to spout and take root.  Marty with clarity explains Luther's idea of Anfechtung (of inner struggle and anxiety), of a Christian being a theologian of the cross, and even the functions of Law and Gospel in the life of a person.  Other biographies may touch on these topics, but not in the way Marty does--so that even a layperson or casual reader can grasp what Luther was getting at.<br /><br />Strewn so informally throughout the book are golden nuggets of Luther's theology and insights that other biographies may not mention--or get wrong, if mentioned!  Luther calling the church a \\"mouth-house,\\" his understanding of vocation, the idea of a \\"hidden God,\\" and other areas too many to mention are nestled within the book, waiting for the reader to unwrap.  In Chapter Three (of four chapters), \\"Living the Faith,\\" Marty hits his stride--bringing to light the challenges of early Lutheranism and also the educational reforms of Luther.  There were times when reading this biography I cried out in delight, \\"Marty, I can kiss that bald head of yours!\\"<br /><br />Marty so touches on the human side of Luther as well.  After Luther's daughter Magdalena died, Marty makes known that Luther \\"was inconsolable and almost lost the ability to sustain the life of faith.  He even spoke of losing his faith for a time, something he never did when he faced and had to fear the hatred and power of popes, emperors, and princes\\" (pg. 111).  Marty's description of Luther's relationship with his wife, Katy, is well done and Marty's \\"connecting of the dots\\" from such scanty historical information is stupendous.  But take note: this is no putting-Luther-on-a-pedestal biography.  Marty even brings out some of Luther's peculiarities, but never in a voyeuristic or gossipy way.  Near the end of the book, he brings out Luther's polemic writings against anyone he saw as an enemy of the Gospel, in particular, the Papacy, Muslims, and Jews (pgs 162-173).  In context, one can see that Luther was not anti-Semitic--but that he viciously attacked all enemies of the Gospel.<br /><br />Despite all the precious jewels awaiting their discovery, Marty leaves untold much of the social and political background going on in Luther's life.  So one unfamiliar with historic events and the \\"lay of the land\\" would be confused, not knowing who is doing what to whom in which context.  For instance, Marty writes on the later souring relationship between Luther and Karlstadt: \\"Karlstadt, who failed to hold the audience in the Leipzig Debate . . .\\" (pg. 79).  Yet, the biography earlier did not even mention Karlstadt in the Leipzig Debate; from Marty's earlier recounting, one would think that it was simply a debate between Johannes Eck and Luther.<br /><br />When Marty covers the Peasants' War(pgs. 96-98), he does so accurately--but incompletely: he leaves unsaid Luther's earlier efforts to mediate peace before the revolt was in full effect.  Luther believed that the peasants in the end would be crushed, and if they rebelled, they would incur God's wrath, since rebellion goes against to His Word.  So Luther pleaded to the peasants not to rebel.  In the infancy of the rebellion, he also pleaded with the Saxon court to act swiftly against any conflict provoked by the Zwickau prophets, fearing that the discord would grow and destroy both the ruler and the ruled.<br /><br />In a few places, Marty allows his personal views to supplant those of Luther.  As an example, Marty's higher-critical views of the Bible come through when he writes: \\"The Scripture was an infallible guide to salvation, even though, contra to the views of the scholastics, in [Luther's] understanding its writers could and did make mistakes when writing on earthly matters\\" (pg. 83).<br /><br />Although what Marty's biography gets right is done so well, I cannot recommend this book as the first biography of Luther to read.  One should first learn the broader historical movements of the Reformation, perhaps by reading Kittleson's biography.  After that, then one should read Oberman's Luther: Man Between God and the Devil.  And as tertiary texts, Marty's and Nestingen's recent biographies should be read savor the insights into Luther's mind.<br /><br />Through Kittleson, one would be well rounded on the Reformation with Luther as its instigator and main character.  Through Oberman, a reader would get insight into the medieval world, Luther's torment over sin, and his battles with the devil.  Finally, through Marty and Nestingen, one would receive wonderful insights into Luther's theology without reading tomes of his voluminous writings.the Peasants' War (pgs. 96-98), he does so accurately--but incompletely: he leaves unsaid Luther's earlier efforts to mediate peace before the revolt was in full effect.

US	51701882	R3CKIWWD2VTE8B	0758606516	551303124	Luther: Biography of a Reformer	Books	2	24	29	N	N	Beautiful book but weak in content	Frederick Nohl was a North American Lutheran who had degrees in education (B.S., Concordia, River Forest, IL) and history (M.A., Northwestern, Evanston, IL).  In his working career, he was a teacher and principal for a couple of Lutheran elementary schools in Illinois.  So his abilities converged that allowed him to write an easy-to-read biography, which he did so in 1962.  Luther: Biography of a Reformer is a renamed version of Nohl's original book, Luther: Hero of Faith.<br /><br />Luther: Biography of a Reformer covers the early life of Luther and that segment of the Reformation well, but dedicates only a few pages to the last decade of Luther's life.  Nohl paints with broad brush-strokes and is sometimes inaccurate in his descriptions.  For example, after chaos began to hold sway in Wittenberg's churchly life in 1522, Luther returned from Wartburg to help to restore order by preaching his Invocavit sermons.  Luther's fellow professor Karlstadt had changed the way the Lord's Supper was received: the laity were told to receive both the body and the blood of Christ--if not, they would be sinning!  Nohl writes that when Luther returned, \\"Those who wanted to receive both the bread and the wine could do so, while those who wanted only the bread were also taken care of\\" (pg. 133).  However, Luther did not do that; he restored communion under one kind until the situation could be sorted out without troubling anyone's conscience.  For Luther considered liturgical changes as a blessing only if they came as Gospel gifts and not as coercive mandates of the Law, as Karlstadt had made them.<br /><br />On Luther's revision of the Mass, Nohl writes that Luther's German Mass became the official order of service for Saxon churches in 1526 (pg. 150).  This is true, but incomplete.  Today, we hail Luther as a champion of the laity and promoter of the vernacular in the Divine Service.  But Luther is not so simple to be classified so quickly.  Luther intended his highly simplified Deutsche Messe (German Mass) only for small village churches with few resources--not as a repudiation of his own earlier and more strictly liturgical work, the Formula Missae of 1523.  Luther's intent was that the poorly educated of Saxony could worship using the Deutsche Messe liturgy, especially in country congregations.  Today, we should note this well when many among us use services so lacking of any formal liturgy that some among us now consider the Deutsche Messe of 1526 to be \\"high church\\"!<br /><br />And the few times Nohl uses his pen to explain Luther's theology, he comes up wanting.  On the term \\"Lutheran,\\" Nohl correctly writes that \\"Luther and many of those supported him did not want to be called Lutherans\\" (pg. 182).  Then he writes, \\"They preferred to be known simply as Christians, or as evangelicals\\" (pg 182).  Again, what Nohl contends is true, but incomplete, for Lutherans also preferred the term \\"Evangelical Catholic.\\"  For Luther, true reformation was marked by a recapturing of Christianity's evangelical, catholic, and orthodox past.  Luther did not want his reforms to end up within a sect; he wanted them to stand within that \\"great cloud of witnesses\\" (Hebrews 12:1) and testify to the living God in the \\"one holy, catholic, and apostolic church\\" of all time and space.  The following quotation shows the philosophical view of the Lutheran reformers: \\"So we teach nothing . . . that is alien either to Scripture or to the church catholic.  We have simply cleansed and brought into the light the most important statements in the Scriptures and the [Church] Fathers that had been obscured by the sophistic quarreling of recent theologians\\" (Kolb-Wengert, Apology of the Augsburg Confession: 1, I, 32)<br /><br />When Nohl writes about Luther's understanding of the Gospel, he records, \\"Because of his faith in Christ, the believer is a `free lord, subject to no one'\\" (pg. 83).  Luther understood that St. Paul never said that one is saved because of faith but through or by faith--the cause is always God's grace, Christ's work.  Faith is God's gift to the believer and through God-given faith, the believer simply believes.  To be correct, Nohl should have written, \\"By faith in Christ, the believer is a `free lord, subject to no one.'\\"<br /><br />Concerning Luther's \\"Gospel discovery,\\" Nohl describes it in this way: \\"I see the answer!  God punished Jesus in my place, the same Jesus who had kept God's holy Law.  By punishing His Son, God carried out His threat that sin will be punished by death.  All I have to do is . . .\\" (pg. 47).  Nohl's error to direct the reader inward is appalling because it misapprehends Luther's understanding of justification.  Nohl's improper explanation directs a person to look to his own works, decision, or belief instead of Christ alone for salvation.  It also robs a person of salvation's certainty because it directs him to his own efforts instead of Christ's.  When Nohl explains Luther's Gospel discovery, he unwittingly puts the reader back under the Law.  From that, Christ has set us free; the Gospel has no \\"ifs\\" or \\"strings\\" attached.  I can hear Luther now cursing anathemas on Nohl's misunderstanding of the Gospel.<br /><br />On the purely positive side, of all the chapters in the book, I found Chapter 10, \\"The Family Man,\\" to be jewel to seek out.  It that chapter, Nohl gives a glimpse of the man Luther, and his relationship with his wife and children.  Nohl's retelling of Luther losing two of his daughters to death shows forth Luther's humanity for all to see, as well as his confidence in Christ in such a true, personal way.  Especially touching was a letter Luther had written to his son, Hans (pgs. 170-173).<br /><br />In his book, Luther: Biography of a Reformer, Nohl has written an engaging and quick read.  However, Nohl takes some license when he \\"connects the dots\\" of Luther's life, taking some liberties and distorting what may have really happened.

Early in the book he writes, \\"This is not a self-help book. . . .  It is about becoming what God created you to be.\\"  Warren concludes that each person exists: (1) for God's pleasure, (2) to be in God's family, (3) to become like Christ, (4) to serve God, (5) and to evangelize.  In a sudden blitzkrieg, at the book's outset, Warren attacks our natural, self-centered ways: \\"It's not about you,\\" he hails (pg 17).<br /><br />And what a lively text he has written!  Simple prose adorns its pages.  Short, bursting sentences drive home his point about a purpose-driven life.  Warren has driven away abstract, theological concepts to the distant hinterlands.  Forceful expressions and illustrations bring his ideas into the reader's real-world experience.  Even for Christians who use the expression \\"the hammer of the Law,\\" Warren turns up the notch in a refreshingly new way.  \\"If a jeweler's hammer isn't strong enough to chip off our rough edges, God will use a sledgehammer.  If we're really stubborn, he uses a jackhammer.  He will use whatever it takes.\\" (pg 196)<br /><br />Sadly, however, what Warren gives with the right hand in clear prose, he takes away with the left by faulty theology (and deficient Bible paraphrases)!  A worldview of free will in the spiritual realm weaves it way through the text, creating a tangled skein of twisted theology.  Can one \\"dead in trespasses and sins\\" (Ephesians 2:1) truly want to \\"whisper the prayer that will change your eternity: `Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you.'\\" (pg 58)?  Can one really \\"make God smile\\" and earn His favor by what he does? (pg 69)  Christ is \\"the source and perfecter of our faith\\" (Hebrews 12:2); He is our \\"righteousness, sanctification, and redemption\\" (1 Corinthians 1:30).  Yes, Warren repeatedly writes that it's not about you, but then repeatedly goes on about what you have to do to please God: he uses \\"you must\\" 73 times, \\"you should\\" 35--but \\"God will\\" only 32 times and \\"God would\\" seven.<br /><br />Even if one were to read The Purpose Driven Life as only a book on Christian living, he would still read much that is errant.  Warren sees a person's Christian living as being God's chief aim: \\"God's ultimate goal for your life on earth is not comfort, but character development.\\" (pg 173)  A Christian's goal then is to become like Jesus.  But as Warren declares: \\"You cannot reproduce the character of Jesus on your own strength.\\" (pg 174)  How true; Warren correctly states that God must be personally involved in our sanctification, truly working within us to conform us into Christ's image, for the good works accomplished by the redeemed were ordained before the foundations of the world (Ephesians 2:10), and are the fruits of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22).<br /><br />Notice that Scripture calls the good works of a Christian the \\"fruits of the Spirit\\"; good works are Christ's working in us through the Spirit He has sent.  However, in sanctification, \\"God waits for you to act first.\\" (pg 175)  Warren even says that \\"obedience unlocks God's power.\\" (pg 174)  Yes, God is involved in our sanctification, but only as far as He helps us to complete what we already begin on our own strength!  \\"The Holy Spirit releases his power the moment you take a step of faith.\\" (pg 174, italics in original)  How ironic: Warren--a Southern Baptist trained pastor--is promoting a theology that is at its core the same as Medieval Roman Catholicism: God helps Christians to do good works only after they have already done what lies within them (facere quod in se est)!<br /><br />As Warren teaches on justification, so he teaches in sanctification: people need to take the initiative before God will act: \\"Put Jesus Christ in the driver's seat of your life and take your hands off the steering wheel.\\" (pg 83)  Note St. Paul's emphasis; he does not say \\"Crucify yourself with Christ.\\"  Galatians 2:20 reads: \\"I have been crucified with Christ.  It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.  And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\\"<br /><br />In The Purpose Driven Life, Warren slices out the very heart of the Reformation, replacing it with the works righteousness of Rome, but with a decidedly Protestant veneer.  He makes good works--not Christ--the focus of the Christian's life.  His book is no mere guide for our lives: Warren makes the Law one's motivator and way to please God to earn His favor.  Warren sees God's smiling on a person as the result of the Christian's obedience and the reason Christians seek to do God's will in the first place.  How sad, for the life of good works is a response to God's saving work for us.  God's grace is the cause, not the goal, of the Christian life.<br /><br />This book is a double-edged sword: when it is good (in its few places), it is very, very good; when it is bad, it is very, very bad.ads: \\"I have been crucified with Christ.

Wenham's commentary is a useful commentary on Leviticus where conservative scholars are rare  indeed.  Especially helpful are Wenham's comments and insights about the Old Testament sacrificial system and its significance. Unfortunately, concerning salvation, Wenham leaves room for the understanding that a person contributes somehow to his justification.

So this make his review more suited for the layperson instead of the pastor.  He has, nonetheless, decided to write a review because he likes this commentary.<br />The author, Roland Murphy, is a scholar in his own right and is well known, having published a commentary on Ecclesiastes.<br />This commentary provides its own translation, which makes comparing the text to known Bible versions interesting and helpful.  Murphy's translation is at times wooden: Murphy tried to follow the form of the text more than other translations.  Thus, his translation does add value and makes reading the text strikingly new.  Not only is the feel closer to the original tongue (from what I can gather) but it also has more assonance and alliteration of the ancient Hebrew.<br />Concerning his commentary, Murphy's detailed discussions are remarkable and his comments are most helpful and filled with insight.<br />To give you a taste of his translation style, below are two well-known Proverbs in the traditional text followed by Murphy's translation.  For Proverbs 16:18, Murphy's beliefs on translation come through are quite clearly.<br />Proverbs 15:1<br />Traditional: A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.<br />Murphy: A soft answer turns back wrath, but a sharp tongue stirs up anger.<br />Proverbs 16:18<br />Traditional: Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.<br />Murphy: Before a collapse, pride, and before stumbling, haughtiness of spirit.	2001-04-11

Although the WELS had pietistic leanings, with the influence of the Missouri Synod, and Hoenecke's hand at the helm of its seminary from 1866-1870 and 1878-1908, WELS changed from pietistic to orthodox.<br />Evangelical Lutheran Dogmatics, Volume IV, is the fourth of four volumes, but the first printed, that Northwestern Publishing House is releasing of Hoenecke's dogmatics notes.  The translators of this text not only looked at the officially published German edition, which was compiled by Adolph's sons Walter and Otto, but the original manuscripts.  Thus, in a few places, the translation is actually truer to Adolph Hoenecke's intent than the German-language edition that many were familiar with two generations ago.<br />The translators, Joel Fredrich, Paul Prange, and Bill Tackmier, tried to produce a text that is accurate yet readable.  A translation can sometimes be excessively literal, with many of the phrases being unnatural and heavy; other times, the level of paraphrase may renders a text useless for personal study.  The translators of this text found the ground between formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence and produced a text in clear and natural English worthy of reading and study.<br />Volume IV contains the following main topics: the means by which one is saved (the Word of God, the Sacraments), the Church, and the Last Things.  The text is 359 pages not including the appendices, so any reader should be aware of the meat in this text that will require full digesting.<br />Hoenecke was a \\"big swath\\" theologian, not a finesse theologian.  This reviewer also found the author bold in his thoughts and beliefs and did not flinch in declaring them, which is exactly what one wants in a dogmatics text.  Because Hoenecke's words one in a while lacked precision, he wrote that a Lutheran pastor takes \\"God's place\\" in the Sacrament of the Altar; Lutherans have always contended that a pastor speaks on behalf of God, in His stead, not in the place of God.  Lutherans have usually reserved this description (and others!) for the Vicar of Christ, on who takes the place of Christ, the Pope.<br />Another example (and there can be many others) is on the Sacrament of Baptism, the author did not flesh out well enough why children are to be baptized.  He barely touches on the meaning of \\"nations\\" (ethnee) in Matthew 28:19 (Therefore, as you go, disciple all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit . . . ISV) and that it not only means those of other nationalities but also of all age groups.  Thus, the onus in those who do not support infant baptism to prove that Christ explicitly excluded infants and children in His \\"great commission.\\"<br />However, the text has much good information in it with many well-thought-out arguments.  In this day, when some Lutheran churches will have laypersons consecrate and distribute the Lord's Supper, we would do well to heed his instruction that only called and ordained ministers should be doing this.  This reviewer will no go into detail on this, for this would make the review too long, but Hoenecke's logic on this, and Scriptural support, is very sound.

This version, like the International Standard Version (only available in the New Testament), tries to take the best of formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence and meld a translation using &quot;optimal equivalence.&quot;<br />For the most part, this translation lives up to its preface. The translation is fairly literal in the sentence structure, that is, it does not rearrange the word order as much as other versions, such as God's Word. This translation does have a few quirks, which are mentioned later in this review.<br />The HCSB uses traditional theological vocabulary, which requires a bit more on the reader's part. This translation is pretty consistent but does use the phrase &quot;declare righteous&quot; for &quot;justified&quot; several times in Romans. Other stylistic variations exist, which will probably be smoothed out in subsequent revisions: &quot;mute&quot; and &quot;could not talk&quot; are both used; iniquity was used once, which seems a bit out of place in this translation.<br />One example of the HCSB taking some translation liberties was it preference for &quot;stumble&quot; or &quot;depart&quot; for &quot;fall away&quot; in the Parable of the Sower; in Luke 8:13, the verb &quot;aphistemi&quot; even has the meaning that such a person has become &quot;apostate.&quot; Yes, &quot;depart&quot; does carry the meaning but is softer than &quot;fall away&quot; and is not as accurate based on the context. Elsewhere, the translation also has a tendency to use &quot;evangelize&quot; where a literal rendering would be closer to &quot;preach the Gospel,&quot; such as in Acts 8:40 and elsewhere. The HCSB violated its own translation philosophy by using a more abstract term, &quot;evangelize,&quot; which can mean many different things to many people when the original &quot;preach the Gospel&quot; (&quot;literally preach the evangel&quot;) is quite clear.<br />However, one rendering to be commended is its choice of &quot;slave&quot; for the Greek &quot;doulos.&quot; Most translations tend to use servant, which does not accurately convey the meaning.<br />Overall, IMO, the HCSB rates better than most bibles in print today, especially the de-facto Bible standard, the NIV. However, this reviewer hopes that the above-mentioned problems will be fixed in subsequent editions. In this reviewer's opinion, the best study version for one to use is still the NASB, with a very close second going to the International Standard Version (for reading devotions).n the original &quot;preach the Gospel&quot; (&quot;literally preach the evangel&quot;) is quite clear. <br />However, one rendering to be commended is its choice of &quot;slave&quot; for the Greek &quot;doulos.&quot; Most translations tend to use servant, which does not accurately convey the meaning.<br />Overall, IMO, the HCSB rates better than most bibles in print today, especially the de-facto Bible standard, the NIV.

Forde opens the heart of Luther's theology in this little book of his: Luther's beliefs on sin, the bondage of the human will, the inability of the unsaved person outside Christ to do a \\"good\\" work in God's eyes, and salvation by grace alone in the cross of Christ.<br />Yes, this book is small--yet what a book it is! In this book Forde covers the 28 theses Luther wrote on this topic, with the first, which presents God's damning Law, to the last, which shines forth the very love of God. Thus, as the reader travels through the book he is faced with God's Law and Gospel. In thesis 21, Forde even corrects a mistranslation in the American Edition of Luther's Works: Luther did not mean the \\"theology of glory\\" but being a \\"theologian of the cross.\\" Forde shows that Luther was not only referring to doctrine, but its application!<br />The theology of the cross is the true Gospel of God's salvation of dead sinners out of His grace through the suffering and death of the cross of Jesus Christ alone; we call this divine monergism, because salvation is God's doing throughout. The theology of the cross rules out and curses all human worth, especially the best we have to offer. For the best we have to offer are the very things on which we are tempted to rely. In extreme contrast is the theology of glory, which is the corruption of the Gospel because it states a waiting God comes to bless a person who contributes some 'little bit,' to his salvation. The cross' exposure of man as completely helpless in his own salvation may offend the theologians of glory. Yet if a person can cooperate in his salvation, decide for God, make a decision for Christ, then the theology of man, that is, of glory pits itself against the theology of grace.<br />If this is a bit abrasive to you in verbiage, you will still find the book to be a splendid read. For this review can hardly do justice to Luther, and yes Forde, who put such theology in such a small amount of print. When you finish this book, you will be yearning its absence immediately, wishing you had savored the pearls of wisdom dripping from its pages.book, you will be yearning its absence immediately, wishing you had savored the pearls of wisdom dripping from its pages.	2001-02-24

This book of Gene Edward Veith's is not a thick tome burdened with theological jargon; it is well-written book on Christian faith and how it influences the living of life.  I suppose Veith could have titled the book, The Theology of the Cross: The Way of Lutherans, for he makes a very valid point on how Lutherans are considered the first Evangelicals.  In truth, Luther himself preferred the moniker Evangelical Catholic, with catholic being used to mean \\"universal.\\"<br />I especially found Veith's chapter on vocation quite compelling.  Each person has a calling to be many things: a citizen, a mother or father or child, a worker, et cetera.  Many things have happened to bring a person to a particular point in life.  If a person is a parent, then as his vocation he should do the best he can at it.  Of course, this is a very inelegant, abbreviated (and terse!) way of explaining one's vocation.  It would be much better to read the book.<br />In short, this is a lucid book on faith and sanctification.  Yet, the book is not a \\"how-to\\" book reduced to giving out tips from the Bible.  This book centers on the Christian faith and the living of it, with some of the focus being on Lutheran thought and belief.  This book will edify the reader, cause him to think, and turn even more the to revealed Word: Scripture and the God-Man, Jesus.	2001-01-31

To reach such a goal, NCV translators used The Living Word Vocabulary, the standard used by such publishers of The World Book Encyclopedia to help decide suitable vocabulary for this version. This version, also, replaced rhetorical questions with direct statements. (Was it genuinely necessary to remove rhetorical questions?) It translated figures of speech according to their meaning, and conveyed the meaning of idiomatic expressions using different phrasing, if needed. Thus, with short sentences and simple words, the NCV is written at a third-grade reading level.<br />Granted, the NCV is very readable. That does not mean, however, its prose is worth reading: its prose is that bland! Many sentences are artificially short. As an unintended by-product of its effort for an understandable text, the NCV editors ended sucking most of the personality out of the text. Even more, some claim that the NCV is anti-Jewish, going beyond preserving &quot;the evidence of intra-Jewish conflict&quot; in the New Testament.<br />In the NCV 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />Suppose someone has enough to live and sees a brother or sister in need, but does not help. Then God's love is not living in that person. (NCV)<br />The NCV receives a C in accuracy but a B in readability.<br />Although this version is not really bad, for easy-to-read versions the International Standard Version and God's Word are--overall--among the best.	2001-01-03

Her contention that the LCMS--even in the beginning with Martin Stephan (Missouri Synod's only Bishop!) and Walther has never adequately defined its concept of ministry.

Because Missouri could never define its concept of ministry with one clear voice, such differences did not lead to any conference splits.<br />Despite some of Mary Todd's \\"feminist\\" views, her book is still enjoyable.  Her detailed description of the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to LCMS adopting women's suffrage at its 1969 convention is quite fascinating.  To get a complete behind-the-scenes picture, a reader also may want to find &quot;A Layman's Guide to Woman Suffrage in the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod&quot; by James Hoke, 1998, Morris Publishing.<br />Unfortunately, Mary Todd also hopes that the same gradual acceptance of women's suffrage (and she goes over the gradual changes intra-synod wide in her book) will lead to the ordination of women pastors.  Culturally, none of us would have problems with such a move; those of us, however, who hold to the scriptural position of women not having spiritual authority over men will disagree with her position.<br />In short, her book is noteworthy--if only for its historical value.  However, her theology is not biblical, nor in line with LCMS's understanding of Scripture.  Thus, this book gets a weak recommendation: the good in the book is too interesting to ignore.  Besides, the book also contains an including Walther's 1875 theses on church and ministry, the 1945 Chicago Statement, and a thorough bibliography.teresting to ignore.

Yes, the translation does pluralize some areas where the original was singular, such as Luther's explanation of the  Ten Commandments in his Small Catechism.  Nevertheless, such pluralizations seem natural to the modern ear and tongue and do not seem a deliberate ruse to avoid using &quot;he, him, or his,&quot; such as the explanation of who is my neighbor.  The translators and editors should not have allowed these subject-verb-predicate  mismatches, but were probably allowed for political correctness.  However, other areas are deliberately so worded for modern correctness, such as portion of the Smalcald Articles where the translators change singulars to plurals to avoid reference to male clergy.  Translators are not to make something likeable to the modern reader but make it understandable.  So my first impressions were off a bit, but not much on pluralizations for political correctness.<br />The references and historical background in the footnotes are superb and bests any BOC yet to come to print.  This alone makes the book worth its purchase--so much so students of the Confessions should have this volume and use it!  It was  especially refreshing to see incorrect references in previous Book of Concord editions corrected in this edition.<br />The biggest possible &quot;problem&quot; with this BOC is its use of Melanchthon's second Latin version of the Apology as the basis for the translation. Kolb and Wengert do make a serious case for their decision, much of which has merit.  I do not have the historical or theological qualifications, however, to say definitively if using Melanchton's second Latin version was the best choice or not, but readers should be aware of this decision.<br />In short, this edition does have some shortcomings of which readers should be aware.  However, it is the most readable BOC to date and has the best footnotes of any BOC, bar none.  Thus, if you want to read the Lutheran Confessions, then buy this edition and read it.  However, for serious study, cross-refer this edition with the Concordia Triglotta to hone in on the original authors' intents.best footnotes of any BOC, bar none.

In that sense nothing new is in this book; that does  not mean the book is worth little.  Luther explains and shows how on can  pray The Our Father (Lord's Prayer), the Ten Commandments, and the Creed.  Surely, anyone can repeat these, but Luther entreats the reader to approach  each Commandment (or petition) as a fourfold garland: a schoolbook, a  hymnal, a penitential book, and a book of prayer.<br />For example, for the  5th Commandment, \\"You must not murder,\\" Luther writes:<br />[Garland 1] Here I  learn, first of all, that God desires me to love my neighbor, so that I do  him no bodily harm . . . that I am obliged to assist and counsel him in  every bodily need.<br />[Garland 2] I give thanks for such ineffable love,  providence, a faithfulness toward me by which he has placed this mighty  shield and wall to protect my physical safety.<br />[Garland 3] I confess and  lament my own wickedness and that of the world, not only that we are so  terribly ungrateful for such fatherly love and solicitude toward us-but  what is especially scandalous, that we do not acknowledge this commandment  and teaching, are unwilling to learn it, and neglect it as though it did  not concern us or we had no part in it.<br />[Garland 4] I pray dear Father to  lead us to an understanding of this his sacred commandment and to help us  keep it and live in accordance with it.<br />This is an abbreviated version  of each garland, for Luther writes more in depth on each fourfold area.  I  found myself praying some of what Luther wrote as I read it, realizing that  I do not pray as I would like.<br />I this era when many do not pray, or pray  ineffectually, this book teaches us the hows and the why.  In the same way  that children must be taught to speak properly, so, too, must the Christian  be taught-for Jesus Himself gave the Our Father for that very purpose.  Prayer is a result of what God has done for us, for without God's mercy and  granting of faith, what person would have the desire to pray to the one,  true God?  Prayer is never a work that one does for God.  God speaks to us  in His Word, and we speak to Him in prayer.<br />This little book can easily  be read in one sitting; yet, one may want to reread it often!  The book's  only fault, which is minor, is that the translation seems wooden and  stilted to the modern ear.  For instance, Pg. 32 reads: \\"It seems to me  that if someone could see what arises as prayer from cold and unattentive  heart he would conclude that he had never seen a more ridiculous kind of  buffoonery.\\"  See how much crisper this translation reads from By Faith  Alone: \\"If it were possible to see into a person's heart, nothing would be  more ridiculous than seeing the thoughts of a cold, undevoted heart in  prayer.\\"<br />Because of this sometimes wooden translation style, this book  garners four stars instead of five.  Nonetheless, do not let the awkward  turn of a phrase keep you from buying, reading, and rereading this book.  This book has value to any Christian desiring to learn how to pray better;  \\"It is a good thing to let prayer be the first business of the morning and  the last at night.\\" (Pg. 18)  In your grace and mercy, dear Father, make  this so.has done for us, for without God's mercy and  granting of faith, what person would have the desire to pray to the one,  true God?

Originally, this book started as Becker's doctoral  thesis in 1957, but was, eventually, expanded into a book.  Thus, a couple  of examples in the book are outdated-but the rest of the book is timeless.  Becker's primary point of the book is that our reason is contrary to God's  way of doing things.  \\"To make the gospel reasonable to unconverted man in  an effort to bring about his acceptance of that gospel is therefore the  height of folly.  Such efforts can only result in a change in the gospel,  consequently a destruction of the gospel.\\" (Pg. 230)<br />Becker no only  delves into Luther's thoughts on human reason, but also how Scripture seems  to contradict.  For instance, the Bible mentions in many places that \\"once  saved, always saved\\" as some like to say.  Yet Scripture also says, \\"take  heed, lest you fall.\\"  Both are correct and true--yet how are we to  reconcile these seeming different doctrines?  Part of this is understanding  the Law-Gospel dynamic, which Becker probes into as well.<br />This is one  book to reread every few years like C.F.W. Walther's The Proper Distinction  between Law and Gospel.  May it find its way onto every Christian's  bookshelf.	2000-09-16

Thus, this edition has a richer selection of historical notes and  introductions, which is quite helpful to the modern reader.  In addition,  some minor changes have taken place in English usage during the last 40  years and, naturally, translators should incorporate such changes.  Last,  this BOC corrects the sporadic error in the Tappert translation, the  standard version now in use (Tappert was a bit on the pietistic side).   Some other participating translators besides Kolb and Wengert are Eric  Gritsch of Gettysburg Seminary and James Schaaf, now deceased, who taught  at Trinity Seminary in Columbus, OH.  Unfortunately, this BOC also  incorporates biblical citations from the New Revised Standard Version.  For  accuracy, if one Bible version had to be used, this reviewer would have  preferred the Updated Version (1995) of the New American Standard Bible.  <br />The contents of this BOC are quite standard, but are worth mentioning  for the non-Lutheran reader.  The contents include a Preface, an  Introduction, a list of abbreviations, and the original 1580 Preface to the  Book of Concord.  Next are the Three Common Creeds of the Christian Faith,  the Augsburg Confession (1530), The Apology [Defense] of the Augsburg  Confession (September 1531), the Smalcald Articles (1537), Treatise on the  Power and Primacy of the Pope (1537), Luther's Small Catechism (1529),  Luther's Large Catechism (1529), and the Formula of Concord (1577).   Several indices then follow: an Index of Biblical References, a  Biographical Index, and a Subject Index.<br />One of my first concerns with  this BOC translation isthat it would be \\"politically correct\\" and avoid  male-gender pronouns.  This reviewer could not find any such overt bias.   Nevertheless, a thorough reading is needed to confirm this observation, but  light reading here and there has found no such tendency.  Since  \\"conservative\\" Lutherans use the confessions the most, it would be  financially unwise for Fortress Press to estrange one of their largest  markets for this new BOC by using \\"inclusive\\" language: the LCMS, the WELS,  the ELS, and other confessional Lutheran groups.  <br />In conclusion, this  latest BOC seems to be a fine translation and worthy to augment other BOCs  now in print.  However, this reviewer is unqualified to make a broad  endorsement and recommend that this BOC should become the new de-facto  version to be used.  Await word from confessional Seminaries for that.   Until then, enjoy reading!	2000-09-01

The translation is vibrant and the devotions are solid, which Martin Luther was masterful at writing. No archaisms or long, Germanic-style sentences get in the way transferring meaning.<br />However, a non-representative selection process devalued what could have been a most-superb book. Core to Luther's theological worldview was that of Word and Sacrament--his understanding of the Gospel. To make the devotional book appeal the general Protestantism, it seems to me that the book's editor chose devotions that did not cover any of the Sacraments more than superficially: The Lord's Supper, Baptism, and Absolution.  Such an editorial decision was untenable.<br />Also, the English stylists favored &quot;God's approval&quot; for &quot;justification,&quot; which some view as theological jargon. However, &quot;approval&quot; hardly covers the entire meaning of &quot;justification.&quot;  Perhaps, the stylists should have favored &quot;declare righteous&quot; or &quot;acquit&quot; instead.  Devotions that deliberately avoid the Lutheran understanding of the means of grace and some poor renderings force this book to have a lower rating than it should have earned!	2000-08-08

In this book, such orthodoxy shines forth in  all its glory, for God's very doctrines blaze from its pages.<br />Readers of  this book will be brought to God's Law, hammered into a realization of whom  they are in relation to God--but such is a reminder, which makes the Gospel  more sweet and refreshing!  Yet Senkbeil writes in such everyday language,  maybe too everyday, that it is very easy for the reader to know Scriptural  truths that apply to his life on this earth.<br />These devotions are such a  superb harvest of Pr. Senkbeil's sermons.  In an existence where no person  can find something sure and true on his own, these devotions extol the God  in flesh, the Person of Jesus Christ.

Many books write from preconceived views, casting Luther in a glorious light as the hero of the Reformation or as a villain, with cruel and anti-Semitic views.  Oberman takes a decidedly different view: he casts Luther with medieval-era  light, bringing the reader closer to Luther's real thoughts than, perhaps,  any other recent Luther biographer.<br />This book haunts the reader, for the  reader is put into Luther's world of God, angels, devils--with powerless  men among these powerful forces.  In truth, this book is so dense and  devil-filled that an uninitiatiated reader with Luther may want to read a  more sanitized version first, such as Kittelson's Luther the  Reformer.<br />Oberman starts his masterpiece with a foundation of religion  and medieval politics and bringing to life Luther's early years.  From  there all chronological flow ceases and Oberman's book becomes a more like  the Bible book of Revelation: the story line is thematic not necessarily  sequential.  For Luther, devils were real beings with which to contend not  unreal figments of imagination.  One needs simply to read Luther's  evening-prayer conclusion before the amen in his Small Catechism: \\"Let Your  holy angel be with me, that the devil may have no power over me\\" to know  this to be true  On earth, the real battle--nay, war--takes place between  good and evil.  Oberman shows Luther's realization that if God were lazily  hanging out in heaven, then the devil would not need such a vociferous  presence on earth.  However, since the Righteous One comes to us on earth,  so, too, does the devil.  Oberman points out that Luther had this epiphany  if the most putrid of places--a stinking outhouse, a place where \\"man's  powerlessness is joined by ignominy.\\"<br />Any biography cannot cover Luther  without covering the theologian.  Oberman here does a balanced, objective  view.  At first, this reviewer thought that Oberman was an atheist, so much  did he remove personal views from his objectivity.  The author covered the  three \\"Solas,\\" which is English translate to \\"grace alone, faith alone, and  scripture alone,\\" which the average Lutheran can parrot without really  understanding their meanings.  However, Oberman does a short shrift on a  fourth intertwined thread of Reformation discovery: \\"gratia universalis\\"  (universal grace) and objective justification: that God wills all to be  saved and, in fact, saved all people by His (Christ, the second Person in  the Trinity) death at Golgotha--but only those with faith, a gift of God,  receive the benefits of Christ's universal sacrifice.<br />In a world filled  with devils, Oberman did not, however, succumb to poor historical  scholarship or National-Enquirer-like storytelling for the sake of a good  story.  A case in point is the story of Luther throwing the inkwell at  Satan when the Evil One paid Herr Luther a visit.  Such a story originated  over 100 years after Luther's death and no contemporary writings, of which  this reviewer knows, of Luther during his Wartburg exile give any hint of  Luther physically seeing a devil.<br />Yes, this book takes work, and at times  is dark and, well, medieval.  But any serious student of Luther must read  this book.  The other texts are good, but only this one put the reader into  the same era as Luther in thought, feeling, beliefs, and understanding.  To  understand a man, one must understand him in his time and context.  Oberman  does this brilliantly!<br />\\"Though demon hordes may swarm the land  All  lusting to devour us,  We are not fearful, firm we stand:  They cannot  overpow'r us.

Kuske puts  forth and explains six principles for interpreting Scripture:<br />1) The  only books that are God's Word are the canonical books of the Bible, 2) the  only worldview of Scripture is the supernatural, 3) the only text that is  determinative is the original, 4) the only literary criticism to be done is  the external king: the historical setting, and 6) the only meaning of the  words is the simple, plain meaning: the grammatical setting.<br />The rest of  the text covers biblical interpretation though Christian history, including  some of the weaknesses of modern, historical-critical methods of  interpretation.<br />This reviewer's only thoughts concerning Kuske's  correctness on all his assertions revolve around two points.  First, Kuske  may favor variant readings a bit much as he urges that since only the  original text is the inspired text, one should favor the oldest and most  widespread manuscripts (true).  However, the early Greek church carried out  this process quite extensively with more material available to them; so the  majority text, which is not synonymous with the Textus Receptus, should not  be cast aside because it is not illumined by the aura of recent discovery.  Also, Kuske puts forward that to decide what a particular word means is to  see how the Bible uses it.  This involves three things: 1) How does the  Bible use a word in a verse or surrounding verses? 2) How does the Bible  use a word throughout the Bible?  3)  What a word traditionally has meant  (etymology)?  All three principles play an important role in learning the  meaning of as passage or word.  Nevertheless, immediate context should  always take prime consideration, something that this reviewer believes  Kuske did not stress enough.<br />Be aware, however, that the two criticisms  mentioned in this review are very minor in relation to what treasures of  gold that Kuske uncovers; do not let them dissuade from the reading and  using of this book.  This text is very accessible, but never patronizing; a  most worthy effort.wo criticisms  mentioned in this review are very minor in relation to what treasures of  gold that Kuske uncovers; do not let them dissuade from the reading and  using of this book.

At first glance, this edition looks unimpressive with its black-cloth, hardback binding.<br />Yet before a review should begin, a little note about Jacobs is in order. Who was Henry Jacobs? He was an American Lutheran pastor, born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in 1844. In 1883, he began teaching systematic theology at Evangelical Lutheran Seminary at Philadelphia. Unfortunately, Jacobs was especially weak in his understanding of the Lord's Supper: he believed the words of consecration were a prayer to God.<br />This reviewer's first thought was, If this translation is so good why wasn't it always in print? Also, Did Jacobs' improper view of the Sacrament of the Altar skew his translation? After opening this book, the publisher obviously used the original plates to reprint this edition. Yet the high-quality binding and paper speak well for this reprint. Thus, it was with mixed emotions and a skeptical eye that this book was reviewed.<br />What is different about Jacobs' edition from the Tappert or Kolb-Wengert editions? What first struck this reviewer was the language. Jacobs edited his Book of Concord at least fifty years earlier than Tappert did. In that short time, language usage had changed enough to be noticeable: Jacobs' edition is full of wordy sentences, and some archaic words, that Tappert's--and even more so Kolb-Wengert's--lacks. Jacobs' English usage, however, is not so far removed that it should hinder any well-educated reader.<br />What also impressed this reviewer was the subtle theological differences between the two editions. For instance, line one of Tappert's Athanasian Creed reads, &quot;Whoever wishes [&quot;wants&quot; in Kolb-Wengert] to be saved must, above all else, hold to the true Christian faith.&quot; Jacobs' reads, &quot;Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic [true Christian] faith . . .&quot; Lutheran understanding of Scripture does not subscribe to a decision-type theology, which is exactly what Tappert's does by using &quot;wishes.&quot;<br />Another area especially lamented by some Lutherans is Tappert's translation from the German of the Augsburg Confession, articles five and seven. Kurt Marquardt does not like the &quot;gratuitous insertion&quot; of the words &quot;that is&quot; in Article Five. Although this may seem trivial, the sentence (which reads, &quot;God instituted the office of the ministry, that is, provided the Gospel and the sacraments.&quot;) collapses the institution of the ministry simply into the provision of the gospel and the sacraments. However, Kolb-Wengert and Jacobs both do a reasonable translation: &quot;God instituted the office of preaching, giving the Gospel and the sacraments&quot; (KW) and &quot;the Office of Teaching the Gospel and administering the Sacraments was instituted.&quot; (Jacobs)<br />The above examples are only two; many more can be cited. Because of some poor renderings in Tappert's Book of Concord, this reviewer strongly recommends that Lutherans consider using Jacobs' Book of Concord and supplementary text--with the Kolb-Wengert as the primary! In addition, because of the its high cost, this reviewer does not recommend the Concordia Triglotta-unless the reader knows Fruhneuhochdeutsch (Reformation-era) German and Latin. Despite Jacobs' improper understanding of the Lord's Supper, he was enough of a scholar not to let his biases skew his Book of Concord effort. With Tappert's pietism, such was not true, as evidenced by his Athanasian Creed translation. Yet don't take this reviewer's word alone; Professor Marquardt said that he liked &quot;everything&quot; about Jacobs' Book of Concord &quot;except the price.&quot; If you do want to purchase Jacobs' Book of Concord, order it.

Thus, many Lutherans have never read much Reformation-era thought on the Sacrament of the Altar, the Lord's  Supper.  Because of these new translations, does Teigen unearth any new  revelation or new Lutheran theology?  No, he does not!  In the first four  chapters, he covers basic Lutheran belief on true presence in the Lord's  Supper and why, based on Scripture, we believe what the mind cannot  fathom.<br />Yet saying that this book is without controversy among some  Lutherans would be false.  For in chapter five, Teigen covers what Martin  Chemnitz believed about consecration and what it effected, that is, caused.  According to Teigen, Chemnitz believed that the consecration brings about  true presence, not distribution or reception.  Although quite  controversial among the different Lutheran churches today (WELS, ELS, CLC  [Concordia Lutheran Conference], to name a few), did Teigen get Chemnitz  right, or did Teigen go off on some tangent?  Let's see!  Question 251 in  Chemnitz's book, Ministry, Word, and Sacraments, asks about consecration  and its relation to Jesus' true presence: If the words of institution have  been recited over the elements (consecration), are Christ's body and blood  present, even if no one receives the elements, and they are instead  &quot;laid up, enclosed, or carried about?&quot;  Chemnitz replied that  Christ did not set up this Sacrament for such abuses.  Nevertheless, even  if no one receives the elements, Christ's body and blood are still present!  Whoa--if a modern-day Lutheran theologian wrote this he would be accused  of being a transubstantiationist.<br />Nevertheless, thie revieweer must  concede that Teigen did portray the theology of Chemnitz correctly.  It now  begs the question if Chemnitz was correct in his understanding of the  Lord's Supper.  On the same subject, Luther wrote that no person's  word or  work produces the true presence of the body and blood of Christ in the  Supper, whether it be the merit or declaration of the minister, or the  eating and drinking or faith of the communicants; but all this be ascribed  alone to the power of the Almighty God and the institution and ordination  of our Lord Jesus Christ.  [But all that which we have present in the  Supper of Christ is to be ascribed absolutely and altogether to the power  and Word of Almighty God and the institution, etc.].  Yes--Chemnitz agree  with Luther on this.  Both Martin are of one mind on this issue: the  consecration effects true presence, not the distribution and  reception.<br />Why then should Lutherans believing that consecration effects  true presence be controversial at all?  Teigen wrote that 17th century  theologians strongly influenced our modern Lutheran thought on Jesus' true  presence.  These theologians were, in turn, influenced by Melanchton--not  Chemnitz, not Luther.  Even Missouri Synod's first president, Ferdinand  Walther, fell prey to this Melanchtonian error when he quoted Quenstedt in  his Pastoral Theology: &quot;The sacramental union does not happen except  in the distribution.&quot;  Other conservative Lutherans say that without  distribution and reception a valid Sacrament does not exist (with which  this reviewer agrees).  Nevertheless, this reviewer agrees also with  Teigen, Luther, and Chemnitz: it is the consecration that effects true  presence.  What are other arguments that some Lutherans have against  believing that the consecration effects true presence?<br />-First, such  beliefs about consecration have been the belief of some Lutherans but not  the Lutheran Church.  In response, are Luther, Chemnitz, and The Book of  Concord &quot;some Lutherans&quot;?  -Second, some raise questions about  what happens if the consecrated elements are spilled before consumption if  Jesus' true presence isreally in the elements?  In response, we Lutherans  should always use simple, clear passages for deciding doctrine, in this  case, &quot;This is my body; this is my blood.&quot;  We never should use  unclear or dark passages (or ideas) for establishing doctrine, in this  case, the question about spilled wine/Christ's blood.  It is a serious  matter when any Christian questions such a &quot;sedes doctrinae&quot;  passage.<br />Luther's response to both questions would be, &quot;Since, then,  He [Jesus] says here 'This is My body,' He certainly can and does make it  so. ...........&quot;  One area that Teigen does not cover in depth is the  difference between Luther and Chemnitz on true presence outside the  Sacrament of the Altar.  This reviewer beleives that Chemnitz would contend  that Jesus' true presence still exists and that  Luther would say that  outside the Sacrament no true presence exists, that is, the elements would  have to be consecrated, distributed, and received.<br />Despite such  differences, this reviewer cannot say--with absolute certainty, since  Scripture does not say--what does happen to Jesus' true presence in the  unused elements after the Lord's Supper is finished (sometimes called the  &quot;reliquae&quot;).  This reviewer assumes that Jesus' presence would  leave since the sacramental act is finished, and Christ's words, &quot;This  do,&quot; have been completed.  Nonetheless, such thought is purely  speculation!  Yet even if Chemnitz may be correct, how then should we  as Lutherans handle the unconsumed elements, the reliquae?  Chemnitz's and  Luther's response was to consume all the elements (refer to Luther's letter  to Wolferinus on this subject, dated 20 July 1543*).  Such practice would  prevent a person from taking offense; it would, also, prevent such a  &quot;what if&quot; questions about the unused elements from ever being  asked.<br />If we in the modern Lutheran churches decide to continue, and  most often begin, this practice of consuming all the elements, we would  have to decide more carefully the right amount of wafers and wine for  consecration.  This would prevent an unusually large amount of consecrated  elements for the pastor and elders to consume at the end of the  Sacrament.<br />Yes, Teigen's book unflinchingly looks into a subject that  many Lutherans would prefer to forget: it makes us uncomfortable thinking  that our modern-day practice may be incorrect.  This reviewer,  nevertheless, must agree with Teigen because Teigen agrees with Luther and  Chemnitz, both of whom were right.  In truth, this reviewer would go as  far as to say that any person who denies that consecration effects true  presence makes the Lord's Supper into a human work.  For then only one  other conclusion exists: it is our work (distribution and reception) that  effects Jesus' true presence.  When a Christian denies the power of the  Lord's Word to cause true presence, such denial removes the spiritual  comfort that this means of grace provides.  For is not a means of grace  completely God's work, and not ours?<br />* Excerpts from the Wolferinus  letter:<br />&quot;For if such a quick breaking off of the action really  exists, it will follow that after the speaking  ..........&quot;<br /> &quot;Therefore, we shall define the  time of the sacramental action in this way: it starts with the beginning  the Our Father and lasts until all have communicated, have emptied chalice,  have consumed the hosts, the people have been dismissed, and [the minister]  has left the altar.  In this way, we shall be safe and free from the  scruples and scandals of such endless questions.

The NRSV translators used knowledge gained from  recent archaeological discoveries, such as the Dead Sea scrolls.  Perhaps  most obvious is an addition of four sentences between 1 Samuel 10 and 11.  New critical editions of the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament have  much influenced the NRSV's text.  NRSV translators did not try following  the KJV scrupulously in this revision; instead, they gave preference to the  original languages.<br />The NRSV is the first translation mandated to do  away with male-gender references if the text applies to men and women.  However, the translators did not neuter God's masculine nature.  This  reviewer believes, however, that the NRSV's use of gender-neutral language  has gone too far and has traversed into the area of paraphrase.  NRSV  translators used plural nouns and pronouns to avoid using the singular him,  he, or his, shifting the focus from an individual to a group.  Also, the  translators neutered some passages that specifically refer only to males,  for example, Acts 4:4 and 1 Timothy 3:2.  Despite its shortfalls, the NRSV  does read beautifully and has a liturgical meter the NIV lacks.<br /> In  the NRSV 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />How does God's love abide in anyone who has  the world's goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet re-fuses  help?

The REB's predecessor paraphrased many passages, trying to achieve a  \\"sense-for-sense\\" translation.  This over-paraphrasing led to many poor  renderings that even NEB admirers had to admit existed.  Thus, scholars  began working on the REB to improve accuracy and intelligibility.  Such  changes also produced a more dignified text better suited for public  reading.  In trying for \\"modern, timeless English\\" the translators even  tested their final product with readers and writers to confirm real-world  readability.  During the revision process, translators made the REB more  literal than the NEB; they did not, however, correct all its mistakes.  For  example, translators did correct the NEB's placement of most of Jeremiah  12:14-15, which they placed after verse seventeen.  Yet, for some odd  reason, the REB kept the NEB's placement of Isaiah 41:6-7 between Isaiah  40:20-21!<br />Yes, the REB does have its shortcomings.  Still, readers can  use the REB with greater confidence than they could use its predecessor.<br /> In the REB 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />But if someone who possesses the  good things of this world sees a fellow-Christian in need and withholds  compassion from him, how can it be said that the love of God dwells in him?

A NKJV's goal of the editorial board was to restore the 1611 text, but make necessary language changes for the modern reader.  Thus, sheweth has become shows, and you and your is used for thee, thou,  and thy.  The revisers also modernized punctuation and used quotation marks  to set off dialogue.<br />Nevertheless, the minimal changes from the KJV are  this version's strengths, and weaknesses.  This version does keep much of  the majestic language; it does not, however, follow twentieth-century  English usage.  The NKJV also relies very heavily on the Textus Receptus as  its New Testament Greek source, ignoring many recent findings to help  produce a more accurate translation.<br />This reviewer finds the NKJV a  fine, conservative translation, and in areas of Christian doctrine it is  very accurate!  This Bible is ideal for well-educated readers who find the  17th century prose of the KJV too far removed from contemporary language.<br /> In the NKJV 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />But whoever has this world's  goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts his heart from him, how does  the love of God abide in him?

Other than a few awkward renderings, no other  modern version reads as beautifully.  Compared with its predecessor, the  NJB's text is loftier, more  literal, and less colloquial.

Ninety translators checked and modified Taylor's paraphrase against the original manuscripts; thus, this version  carries more scholarly authority than its predecessor.  The seven-year  effort to turn a paraphrase into a translation was meant to make the NLT  suitable--not only for devotional use--but also for study, and  congregational reading.<br />The editors were only partly successful.  The  differences in translation styles and theology among the translators were  not evened out in the different books they translated.  Thus, one can read  in one Gospel concerning the Lord's Supper that it represents Christ's body  and blood, while another Gospel accurately translates that it is Christ's  body and blood.  Despite one's theological position, a translator should  have enough integrity to translate and not write his own commentary.  However, to be even-handed, this reviewer loves the NLT's rendering of  Matthew 7:23; only it among the plethora of version gets the gist of the  Greek right in this instance: that such prophesying was  &quot;unauthorized.&quot;<br />In reading style, only the CEV reads more  smoothly aloud among the modern versions in print.  John Wilson wrote,  \\"Other versions, such as the NIV and the NRSV, have been acclaimed by  consensus for their accuracy, but none of the leading general-purpose  translations can match the clarity, rhythm, and readability of the NLT.\\"  Nevertheless, superior prose can never substitute for superior accuracy;  this is the NLT's situation.  It is a very worthy effort with mediocre  efforts.  In the gender-neutral language use, the NLT succumbs to the  same poor renderings that most other modern versions make: it often  pluralizes what is singular in the original languages.  Again this removes  the focus from an individual and places it on a group simply to avoid using  he, him, or his!<br />In the NLT 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />But if one of you has  enough money to live well, and sees a brother or sister in need and refuses  to help-how can God's love be in that person?

About  100 other consultants, scholars, reading experts and translators from  around the world helped produce the CEV.  However, the CEV is not  simply another easy-to-read Bible version.  The translation team also  wanted to produce a Bible for people who depend on hearing the text, not  only reading it.  Thus, the CEV translators spent hours reading their work  aloud.  They printed lines of poetry in short phrases; editors changed  punctuation and chose words for their smooth rhythm and grace.  In this  reviewer's opinion, the CEV in this area did succeed: most other modern  Bible version cannot compare in rhythm and smoothness.  Among the modern  versions, only the NJB and New Living Translation (NLT) read more  beautifully and nobly.  Unfortunately, the CEV is worse that any other  Bible in accuracy to the original texts--even worse that Today's English  Version!  The CEV is simply too simple; this causes the CEV to be  inaccurate through the loss of nuance, if not mistranslated.  The CEV's  preface quotes Luther justifying its translation style.  &quot;Whoever  would speak German must not use Hebrew style.  Rather he must see to  it-once he understands the Hebrew author-that he concentrates on the sense  of the text, asking himself 'Pray tell, what do the Germans say in such a  situation?'  Once he has the German words to serve his purpose, let him  drop the Hebrew words and express the meaning freely in the best German he  knows.&quot;<br /> Perhaps the CEV's translators--for the sake of text  accuracy--should have listened to Luther's words on translating a bit more.  &quot;On the other hand I have not just gone ahead anyway and disre-garded  alto-gether the exact wording of the original.  Rather with my helpers I  have been very careful to see that where everything turns on a single  passage, I have kept to the original quite literally and have not lightly  departed from it. . . . I preferred to do violence to the German language  rather than to depart from the word.&quot;<br /> The CEV also  acknowledges contemporary concern for gender-neutral language.  For  example, CEV translators have translated \\"sons of Israel\\" according to its  actual meaning: \\"people of Israel.\\"  However, they did not do away with  masculine pronouns when referring to God.  Yet the translators did neuter  some passages that specifically refer only to males, and often used plural  nouns and pronouns to avoid using the singular him, he, or his.  The  translators went too far in their gender neutering, changing the meaning of  God's Word.<br />  In the CEV 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />If we have all we need  and see one of our own people in need, we must have pity on that person, or  else we cannot say we love God. (CEV)<br /> The CEV receives an F in  accuracy but a B+ in readability.<br />In short, this version is not worth  buying; save your money.  For an easy-to-read version buy the International  Satandard Version of God's Word.  For serious study, buy the New American  Standard Bible.e original.

The revisers of God's Word (GW) originally intended this version simply to be a revision of Beck's An  American Translation (AAT).  However, they so completely revised GW from  the AAT, and its New Testament translation, the New Evangelical Translation  (NET), that the revising committee decided to call GW a new translation,  and rightly so!  It is as revised from Beck's AAT as the NRSV is from the  KJV.  Although GW is very readable and--overall--accurate for an  easy-to-read version, readers still should note it has some problems.  At  best, a translation is a very close approximation.  At worst, it may  change, delete, or skew a passage's meaning.  God's Word does that in a few  areas.  GW translates &quot;to be justified&quot; as &quot;to have God's  approval.&quot;  What does &quot;justified&quot; mean?  It means that God  has given us His approval and acquitted us of our wrongs because of what  Jesus has done for us.  &quot;Justified&quot; means much more than simply  &quot;God's approval.&quot;  Also, GW uses &quot;because of&quot; where  other translations use &quot;by&quot; or &quot;through&quot; when referring  to faith.  This impresses that God has granted forgiveness (and so saves a  person) as a result of the person's faith.  The causes of salvation are  God's undeserved kindness and Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.  God declares  people righteous (acquits them) and saves them by faith not because of  faith.<br />This version, also, has a few areas where the sentences are  artificially short.  Fortunately, they are never to the point of being  patronizing.<br />In other areas, this reviewer particularly liked GW's clean  format, and its preservation of poetic styles when in the original  texts.<br />In the GW 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />Now, suppose a person has enough to  live on and notices another believer in need.

To reach such a goal, NCV translators used The Living Word Vocabulary, the standard used by such  publishers of The World Book Encyclopedia to help decide suitable  vocabulary for this version.  This version, also, replaced rhetorical  questions with direct statements.  (Was it genuinely necessary to remove  rhetorical questions?)  It translated figures of speech according to their  meaning, and conveyed the meaning of idiomatic expressions using different  phrasing, if needed.  Thus, with short sentences and simple words, the NCV  is written at a third-grade reading level.<br />Granted, the NCV is very  readable.  That does not mean, however, its prose is worth reading: its  prose is that bland!  Many sentences are artificially short.  As an  unintended by-product of its effort for an understandable text, the NCV  editors ended sucking most of the personality out of the text.  Even more,  some claim that the NCV is anti-Jewish, going beyond preserving \\"the  evidence of intra-Jewish conflict\\" in the New Testament.<br />In the NCV 1  John 3:17 reads:<br />Suppose someone has enough to live and sees a brother or  sister in need, but does not help.

One needs only to look a Martin Chemnitz' four giant tomes  on the examination of the Council of Trent to know this was true--and  widely known.  Nevertheless, today, many Lutherans and Catholics claim that  the difference between their confessions is really not such a giant  chasm.<br />Dr. Robert Preus, however, would disagree that true differences  between Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism no longer exist.  In this, his  final book before his death in November 1995, Dr. Robert Preus shows  through recent documents and scholarship that true agreement has not really  been reached between these two churches.<br />Dr. Preus shows that the  priority in dialogues between Lutherans and Catholics is &quot;external  unity and external peace among the churches.&quot; (pg. 106) He brings to  the fore that new definitions to define old terms have taken place instead  of true agreement: \\"an amalgam of the old Lutheran and Roman Catholic  definitions, or rather, a pasting together of the two disparate sets of  definitions--sort of like a treaty.\\" (pg. 111)  Preus unmasks that  agreements like the Joint Declaration are really vehicles that explain away  true doctrinal differences as mere non-divisive  differences.<br />Nevertheless, true differences do exist between Roman  Catholicism and confession, orthodox Lutheranism.  Here are a few for  starters: 1) the authority of Scripture, 2) the doctrine of justification,  the focus of this book, 3) the authority of the pope, 4) the number and the  nature of the sacraments, and 5) the role of the Virgin Mary and the  saints.<br />Buy the book to read the searing truth told in a non-vehement  way.  For &quot;when two parties say they depend upon the saving grace of  God for salvation, and by grace one party (the Lutherans) means the saving,  loving disposition of God and the other party (the Roman Catholics) means  an infused quality, can they be said to share a common confession?&quot;  (p. 54.)  If you want to believe that no doctrinal differences exist and  you like plugging your ears and singing happy melodies, then avoid this  book.

It took seven years and 115 scholars to produce this version.  Most scholars consider the NIV a  conservative translation that has kept interpretation to a minimum, in most  cases.  Most scholars respect the NIV for being accurate and fairly free  of bias.  The New York Bible Society used a very careful editorial  process for this translation.  Before final approval was given for any  passage for inclusion, at least twenty-five to thirty translators examined  the passage in question.  In the end, translators averaged 170 hours of  labor for each Bible chapter.  Despite such effort, which gave this Bible  a remarkable leap in being understandable, this reviewer finds the prose  flat and lacking a good liturgical meter.<br /> In the NIV 1 John 3:17  reads:<br />If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need  but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?

The most word-for-word, formal-equivalence Bible available today is the New American Standard Bible (NASB).  Such scrupulousness to the original text lends itself very well for use as a study Bible.  Originally, as a  Bible for reading, the language was at times wooden and awkward.  The  updated version, however, is not quite as wooden-feeling as the 1966  version: its punctuation style is more current style and it uses fewer  archaic words (for example, reckoned is now credited and beholds is sees).  The NASB is a revision of the American Standard Version (1901), but is even  more literal than its predecessor.  In the 1966 version, this literalness  virtually applied throughout the NASB, except in the use of thou, thee, and  thy when addressing God.  Neither the Greek, Hebrew, nor Aramaic texts used  special pronouns when referring to God.  However, in the 1995 version, the  NASB does not use thee or thou when referring to God.<br />Bible scholars  recommend the NASB for its accuracy in translating various terms, synonyms  and tenses, for its use of articles, and for the way it treats passages  about Jesus.  Nevertheless, this reviewer considers the NASB the best  version for serious reading and Bible study.<br />In the NASB 1 John 3:17  reads:<br />But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need  and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?

Only the Lutheran Church of Australia's  Small Catechism even comes close, with very distant second when it comes to  useful diagrams.  This Small Catechism with explanation is right up there  in overall quality with the LCMS's and the ELS' (Evangelical Lutheran  Synod) Small Catechism.<br />Some of the explanations, however, decidedly  support Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) positions.  For  example, any prayer, even grace before a meal, is taught as an \\"act of  worship\\" and, thus, one should not pray with others with whom he is not in  fellowship.  This of course is one of the more &quot;extreme&quot; WELS  positions being espoused.  But then again, this is a WELS catechism!  So a  reader should be aware of the doctrinal positions being taught when using  this catechism.<br />Only two negatives, however, mar this fine production.  First, this Catechism uses the NIV translation exclusively as its Bible  text.  The LCMS's catechism uses the NIV, but favors the NKJV where the NIV  strayed from the original text.  The ELS catechism uses the NKJV  exclusively.  Second, the translation of Luther's Small Catechism is a bit  breezy and slightly paraphrastic.  For this reason I must give this valiant  effort 4 stars instead of 5.	2000-07-27

What is a woman's role in the Church?  What is theman's role?  Everywhere you turn, someone else has a different message about men's and women's roles and responsibilities in the Church. Whom should one believe?  For Christians, only what Scripture, in truth and clarity, says.<br />If you want a clear exposition of what the Bible says, this is the book for you.  This book covers nearly every passage related to the subject, and unites a woman's role in the Church into an understandable whole.  Never has this re-viewer come across a more thorough, Scripturally unbiased and non-patronizing examination into the subject.  But be forewarned, the positions explained are Biblical but not politically correct in today's mindset.<br /> Vernon Grieger is wonderful in clarifying Biblical ideas so they are un-derstand-able even to the common layperson.  Below is how he clarifies the Hebrew expression EZER KENEGEDO used in Genesis 2:18. Some of its translations are &quot;help meet, suitable helper, partner&quot; and &quot;comparable helper.&quot; Grieger understandably separates the expression into its parts.<br /> EZER = helper KE = Prefix indicating likeness NEGED = &quot;in front of&quot; &quot;opposite to&quot; &quot;over against&quot; O = third person singular pronoun<br />The author describes more about EZER KENEGEDO: Thus &quot;what God here said He would make for man was a complemen-ary helper who would both cor-respond to him and yet be opposite to him in nature.&quot; His exegesis says what no translation can--for we have no equal word in English.<br />The book covers the parts played by man and woman in the Fall of Humanity (Genesis 3:4-7), and then later the New Testament roles of men and women.  Pastor Grieger, also, does not shy away from what some may feel to be embarrass-ing Bible passages to the modern Church.  Let me say as well, his study on the topic clearly shows men's Biblical responsibilities--whether men what to hear it or not!<br />After clearly expressing what Scripture espouses, Grieger asks: Will the Church adopt the &quot;ideology of our times, or dare to reassert and live out the man-woman rela-tionship as&quot; stated &quot;in Scripture?&quot; He asks a fitting question.  For men's and women's Church roles are not for us to decide: God has decided for us. Our choice is whether to follow God, or reject His Word by placing our wishes, and reason above Him.<br />Earthly Images of the Heavenly Bride exposes various Scriptural intrepretations used to &quot;prove&quot; many un-Scriptural positions.  The book was an eye-opener for me.  If I must make a complaint it is this--Pastor Grieger does not cover 1 Corinthians 11:5 in his book.  &quot;And every woman who prays or prophesies with nothing on her head dishonours her head.&quot; Some have said if conservative Christians do not enforce this &quot;requirement,&quot; how can they be so biased to enforce the others?  Such an argument falls flat, for St. Paul calls such a head-covering requirement a &quot;custom&quot; (1 Corinthians 11:16). The other injunctions, have no such statement.  Other than the mentioned criticism, the book may be the finest that you'll find on the subject today.  Grieger shows that our Churchly roles are not about rights; they are about the will of God.  May it ever be so.bilities--whether men what to hear it or not!<br />After clearly expressing what Scripture espouses, Grieger asks: Will the Church adopt the &quot;ideology of our times, or dare to reassert and live out the man-woman rela-tionship as&quot; stated &quot;in Scripture?&quot; He asks a fitting question.

Its editors did not try translating what was literally  written; they instead tried translating meaning.  Translating dynamically  is a tricky art.  Here the TEV translators only partly succeeded, tending  at times toward commentary.  The TEV's over-paraphrastic wording, although  making the text readable, often added inaccuracies to Bible  passages.<br />Translators of the TEV aimed for a standard English style on a  common-language level.  It was to be neither too simplistic nor too  academic--in other words, common everyday language.  To reach this goal,  the translators and editors jettisoned some theological and religious  jargon.  However, reducing the use of traditional wording also reduced the  TEV to bland, basic prose short on poetry and majesty.  Linguistically,  this made the TEV a translation for those unfamiliar with religious jargon.  However, because of its many inaccuracies, it is not a good study Bible.  The second edition of the TEV (TEV2) restricted revisions mainly to two  areas.  First, to reduce the use of male-gender language that applied to  both sexes.  Second, to correct translations that were stylistically or  exegetically poor.  They did not fully succeed.  In gender-neutral  language the translators paraphrased too much, neutering some passages that  refer specifically to males.  In accuracy, Today' English Version is aoubt  as bad as it gets!<br /> In the TEV2 1 John 3:17 reads:<br />If we are rich  and see others in need, yet close our hearts against them, how can we claim  that we love God? (TEV2)<br />TEV2 receives an D in accuracy and an A- in  readability.	2000-07-27

It you are not a Baptist, especially Southern Baptist, you may not like this hymnal.  Yet, this hymnal has retained the best-loved hymns in the Southern Baptist hymnic  tradition, but has broadened the repertoire to include well-loved hymns  from other denominations.  Theologically, the hymnal is a bit  contradictory, which I believe shows disagreement within the Baptistic  tradition concerning Arminianism (\\"I Have Decided to Follow Jesus\\") versus  Calvinism (\\"Not What These Hands Have Done\\").  The language updates are a  bit conservative concerning the \\"thees\\" and \\"thous,\\" yet it does not foist  inclusive language at the expense of theology and poetry.  The musical  arrangements are traditional so they lend themselves well for 4-part  harmony.  The hymnbook is arranged in an almost church-year format, which  is a welcome addition.  In short, this hymnal is thoroughly  conservative yet modern.	1999-12-14

It is worth using as a supplement--not replacement--to both Lutheran  Worship and The Lutheran Hymnal.  HS98 has 113 hymns, a little over  one-fifth of the hymns in Lutheran Worship.  Yet if one were to compare  HS98 with the ELCA's hymnal supplement, With One Voice, both supplement  efforts would be, obviously, completely independent--unlike the Lutheran  Book of Worship and the LCMS' revision of it, Lutheran Worship.  Their  hymnic foci are different, with HS98 only having about 25% of its hymns in  common with With One Voice.  Overall, hymn selection is excellent with a  fair representation of Luthern hymnwriters.  Although the LCMS' Worship  Committee did not choose as many hymns from modern Lutheran hymnwriters as  it should have, we see the modern Lutheran greats Jaroslav Vajda, Martin  Franzmann, and Kurt Eggert included.  In addition, LCMS Pastor Steven  Starke will soon be in the company of the Lutheran greats if his hymn  writing continues being as strong as evidenced in HS98.  Notwithstanding,  neither did the HS98 editors forget the other modern hymn writers, with  Timothy Dudley-Smith being favored a bit too much, perhaps at Kurt Eggert's  expense.<br />The supplement is going in the right direction, but is not yet  completely there.	1999-12-14
