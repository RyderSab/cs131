Grace was a virgin, but not a wimp, especially when it came to defending Noah against his grandmother (who's also her boss).  She's nurturing and self-conscious about her figure, but Noah doesn't care about that.  To him, she is beautiful, and he comes to realize that maybe he's subconsciously wanted her in his life for the past few years.  Noah, without a doubt, is a hunk of the first order, and so is his brother, Ben.  After breaking off his engagement, Noah only wants a sexual relationship, and Grace, who's always loved him, readily agrees.  But as time goes on, he becomes more protective of Grace, especially when she goes to work for Ben.  This story had great sensuality, but also lots emotion --as we peel away the layers of Noah's personality -- and humor (the scene where Grace is interpreting Spanish for Noah's ex is especially funny).  I highly enjoyed the book and I wish Ms. Foster would do a story for Ben!	2002-07-05

The story begins with Laura's husband offering his wife to another man as payment for his gambling losses.  He ends up paying with his life.  Laura Cheney is a gently-bred lady with spunk.  She's went through labor alone and she's penniless.  While she digging for water, her son is kidnapped by the man who won her in a bet. Though she has no money, Laura is desperate and goes into town.  She finds Deke Sheridan, a white man raised by Indians.  After an illuminating conversation, he agrees to help her.  I really liked this couple.  Deke was harsh, but only because of his past and the surroundings he lived in.  CA slowly gets Deke to respect Laura's determination (riding a horse after giving birth only three days prior, continuing on the trail while ill) and her feistiness.  He also saves her life by telling his brother that she's his wife, much to Laura's dismay, but she learns their ways and comes to respect Deke's adopted family. As a mother, I felt for Laura when she realized her son was missing, and I could empathize with her wanted to find him so desperately.  Deke was a heartthrob, too.  He's not very educated in the intellectual sense, and his mouth is foul sometimes, but he did know a lot about human nature.  Laura's steel-tempered gentility slowly cracks the shell that has become Deke's shield for so long.	2001-06-07
US	51968560	R1NV0Z2SW7PTC	0843928603	339465057	Compromised Hearts	Books	5	42	44	N	N	A story I've looked for since the first time I read it.	I breathed a sigh of relief when I finally located this book at the local library. The story opens up with the heroine dragging a stubborn mule and carrying a young boy named Thornton on her back.  She was on her way to live with her brother when her traveling companions are attacked by Indians.  She and the boy are the only survivors.  Emily is a delicate-looking, blue-bred Boston lady with an extensive vocabulary, but she's not a snob.  She is full of grit, pride, strength and can land a punch that would make most men gape.  Cloud Ryder, one-quarter Indian and all man, finds her and the boy and offers to take them where she is going for a price -- her body.  Naturally, Emily is appalled, yet strangely drawn to him, and she does it because she believes that Cloud will desert her and Thornton (who calls her his Mama). To Cloud's benefit, Emily doesn't call his bluff.  On the way, Emily discovers her passionate nature, but she's determined not to cling to Cloud the way many of his lovers (whom they happen to meet along the way) have a tendency to do. There are plenty of dangers on the trail, including another Indian attack, outlaws, and the manipulative sister-in-law Emily meets when she finally arrives at her destination.  By this time, Cloud discovers that he's got strong feelings for Emily (despite his cynicism towards women) and promises to come back for her in a few weeks.  But Emily's sister-in-law has other plans.  I like the way the author has Cloud become increasingly protective and jealous of the attention Emily gets from men and his former lovers.  He loves her, but he just doesn't know it.  The cast of characters in the book kept me glued to the pages the first time I read the story over ten years ago, as well as the second time around.  I became reacquainted with Cloud's two brothers, Thunder and Wolf,  and his sister, Skye, as well as Giorsal, a feisty Irish girl whom Emily befriends while staying with her brother.  Even Thornton, who turns out to be ahero more than once, captured my heart.  I'm trying to find out if there are any books about the Ryder siblings or Thornton.  Compromised Hearts is a keeper.	2001-06-04

Tory Bodeen is blessed or cursed (however one may view it) with the gift of 2nd sight.  Just about everyone in town is either afraid of her or fears her.  Her best friend, Hope was murdered and Tory sensed her friend's demise.  I've read many Nora Robert's books and this one was one of the spookiest.  I like the way the author let Tory have conversations with Hope through dreams that didn't appear to be quite dreamy.  There was one scene when Tory had fallen asleep while Hope's killer is nearby and Hope warns her.  I felt a chill up my spine when Tory pops up out of her sleep like a jack-in-the-box.  I liked Cade, too.  He was able to empathize with Tory, even though his mother blamed her for Hope's death.  He was earnest in his feelings for Tory, even though she's afraid to get close to anyone, thanks to Hope's death and past child abuse.  Hope's twin sister even comes around, despite being jealous of Tory and Hope's friendship. If you like reading a story with a good mix of mystery and paranormal, this one's a good bet.	2000-12-22

She's opinionated, dresses and fights like a man.  Jared Creed, a Texas Ranger who spent many years as a Comanche brave, is her match in every way. From him, Cricket learns to accept and love her femininity, and still retain her fiery spirit.  This book was the first in a series to feature three daughters who are unusual for their time, when women were considered inferior.  I found myself encouraging Cricket to let go of her fears of being a woman and Jared for being the man to do it.	2000-12-17

This was the first PR book that I read and I'm sorry I lost it several years ago.  Maria is the half-Spanish, half-Irish heiress of her father's ranch and is being pressured by a devious, local Spanish nobleman into  marriage.  In walks Cheyenne Walker, and the two strike sparks off each  other when they first meet.  Maria is probably the most fiery heroine I've  ever read and I really liked her. The story is full of shoot-outs and  hanging parties, as was the custom in the old West.  The story even has a  surprise revelation regarding a member of Maria's household.  If you like a  fast-paced western with a dangerous hero and a fiesty, gun-toting heroine,  read Cheyenne's Lady.  I hope the author will follow-up with another  sequel.	2000-07-05

The hero tends to come off a bit too-roughed for my taste, though. There were times when I found it hard to believe that the heroine would take to a man who would deliberately set out  to hurt her.  Aside from that, I found the story fast-paced and sensually  charged, a book to stay up with.  My only problem is that there are a lot  of similiarities with her other books (Cattleman's Choice, The Case of the  Mesmerizing Boss, etc.). The men are usually rugged, physically and  emotionally; they're also many years older(on the shady side of  thirty-five) than the heroine (who's usually in their early twenties or a  few years older), and the heroine is a virgin or has had such a bad  experience with sex that she's as close to being a virgin as one can get.   I've found it hard to believe that a heroine coming straight out of college  and has had no real love life can fall in love so quickly and know that's  she'll feel this way the rest of her life, without ever dealing with the  euphoria and pain of first love.  I don't mind reading a story with a much  older man every now and then, but after a while it gets redundant.  I don't  understand the author's fascination with rough, older man-vulnerable,  younger woman romances.  This will not stop me from reading DP books,  however, I just hope the formula will change.	2000-06-10

The main characters didn't really know each other but for a few weeks and the marriage didn't happen until about three-quarters of the way through the  book.  The heroine's family seemed a bit one-dimensional; the sister was a  witch in tight jeans and the mother was a flake, but the author never  really gets into what shaped their personalities. The synopis alludes to  the hero needing a wife in order to inherit and meddling relatives, but the  story wasn't really like that and the love scene was non-existent.  I'll  continue to read Dallas Schulze, but if you like a good  marriage-of-convenience book, try THE VOW.	2000-05-20

Benjamin Colter was a battle-scarred ex-Rebel soldier who's been on the search for the men who killed his wife and daughter.  Kinyan is a widow with three children looking for a way to save her ranch and in order to  that she must marry.  She's not crazy about the idea, neither are her twin  boys, but from the time she and Ben meet, you know an fast-paced, sensual  plot is going to emerge.  I like the way the author developed Ben's  relationship with Kinyan's twin boys, and eventually her young daughter  (who reminds him of his little girl).  As the plot unfolds, it's clear that  Kinyan's husband's death was no accident.  The author creates some  intriguing characters, including a saloon whore who's tied to the villain.   I like the scenes where Colter is teaching Kinyan how to defend herself,  and when Ben is injured, Kinyan is determined to help her depressed husband  use his other senses to in order to save their family.  The way the author  weaved those scenes in was pure genius.	2000-05-08

I felt the terror Angelina Marlowe's biological and adopted parents experienced at being on the run for their lives, having no one they  could turn to.  When her parents are killed in a car explosion, the  Marlowe's chauffeur and his wife substitute their dead baby daughter for  Angelina  in order to fool the evil consortium that's taken over Angelina's  grandfather's billion dollar hi-tech company.  They live a secretive life  and when Angelina (Leah) is sixteen, she discovers the truth and is  obsessed with bringing the men to justice, as well as claiming her  birthright.  She also happens to meet the hero, Hawk Bladehunter while he  is in a knife fight.  Though they never speak, they stay in each other's  thoughts through the years.  Years later, Angelina gets a job at the her  grandfather's company as Hawk's assistant. He is now the Head of Research  and Development and the instant he sees Angelina (Leah) he remembers her  and how her innocence had touched him.  He was definitely an alpha male,  drop-dead handsome, confident, straight to the point, even a little  arrogant, but I always got the sense that the heroine was the only woman  who had ever haunted his senses.  He's attracted to her and let's Angelina  (Leah) know it.  She feels the magnetism, too, but is determined to fight  it.  She has to find her grandfather and prove that she's the rightful  heir.  The story is set in the Southwest and I could almost smell the dust,  feel the dry the air.  I really liked the hero because being a Native  American and living on the reservation shaped who he was.  I felt  Angelina's confusion as she struggled to stay on course on one hand and  deal with her feelings for Hawk on the other, especially since he's the one  she might have to protect herself from the most.  My only disappointment  was that the author didn't give a lot of detail about Hawk's background,  though she did mention agrandfather who was a Shaman.  Otherwise, it was a  great read.	2000-05-08

The moment Conn saw Crystal, he was taken with her, until he finds out she's hiding a devastating secret.  I felt for Conn, who was disillusion with the young woman, and for Crystal, who was divided between her husband  and her ruthless father and older brother.  The story shows how the hold  family can have over someone and how hard it can be to overcome, even when  your heart belongs to someone else.  As I read it, I kept wishing that  would hurry up Conn would forgive Crystal, because what she did wasn't  malicious, just out of fear for her mother and younger brother, but the  author showed that in real life, people's feelings don't heal as quickly  and it takes a lot to forgive.	2000-05-08

Then there's his quiet love for Grace, a woman he's known for years.  He wants  her, but he fears he's not family material, because of his brutal past.   The author dips into the subject of child abuse and its' forms with a  sensitivity and depth, making one feel much sadness for the hero, and yet  wanting the reader to scream &quot;Go for it anyway!&quot;.  Though Ethan  is calm, I sensed a fire in him that he was afraid to unlease, and the  author creates a scene that demonstrates his loss of self-control in a  revealing way.  Grace proved herself to be a strong woman, raising a child  on her own, working at the local restaurant and being a part-time  housekeeper for the Quinns, despite her delicate looking features.  This  was my favorite book in the series.	2000-04-27

Marcus and Eliza set off sparks from day one, but I found the story more interesting when after they are caught in a compromising position and her cousin Julian is forced to marry her.  He dies and Eliza is forced to support herself and her aunt by being a tutor for Marcus's twin nieces.  Marcus has been taking solace in the form of brandy because his brother is dead, he's scarred and his damaged hand is constantly in pain.  The story seemed to pick up once he and Eliza married, and I like the way the author managed to make Eliza compassionate towards Marcus despite what happened.  She vows that each night she's going to work on his hand, get him to use it instead of turning to the bottle to dull the pain.	2000-04-27

Jake finds himself attracted to the aloof Victoria and decides to have her  when his plan to regain his land comes to fruition.  The secondary love  story between Ben and Victoria's cousin Emma was good, too.  The way the  author depicted life in the West seemed so real, I felt like I was there.   The only part that disturbed me was when Jake found out Victoria was  pregnant.  He believed it was her dead husband's (who also killed his  parents to get the land). When she tried to tell him that the man couldn't  perform his husbandly duty, he treats her shabbily.  The heroine was a  better person than I.  I found it hard to get past what Jake did, even  though it didn't happen to me.  By the end of the book, I was nearly in  tears (if you read it, you'll find out why).  I hope there will be a sequel  about future Sarratts.	2000-04-27

The hero, Justin tries to thwart her because his father was one  of Isabel's mother's many lovers.  Isabel's mother was writing a book of  memoirs and someone wanted her silenced.  I didn't like Justin at first.   He thought she wasn't his equal just because her blood wasn't blue like  his, but once he saw the she was a human being, and started treating her as  such, the author endeared him to me and Isabel.  The story moves along at a  fast pace as Isabel proves she's his match with her seductive plays and  clever wit. The mystery of who killed Isabel's mother and who was attacking  the other &quot;ladies of the night&quot; kept me glued to my chair.  I  also liked the way the author revealed Justin's secret and why he disliked  Isabel in the beginning.

Sloan Stewart is the eldest of Rip Stewart's daughters.  She is his heir, his rock.  She's the overseer on his plantation. She lives for the land, because past heartbreak has taught her that land is all that one can count  on.  She was always considered unusual by the town's standards.  Now she's  has had a son out of wedlock by her first love, a traitor, and she's made a  secret deal with his brother, Cruz.  Cruz has loved her for years, but  Sloan is too afraid to love him.  When a secret part of Rip's life comes to  light, Sloan is furious and unwillingly turns to Cruz.  The author manages  to keep the romance and action going without sacrificing the heroine's  independent spirit, even when it inconveniences the hero.  She adds  intrigue with Cruz's secret occupation, Cruz's mother and ties up loose  ends with Sloan's son, whom she gave to Cruz to raise because she was  afraid to love him.  The secondary love story with Luke was a nice touch,  too.  All in all, the story was well-written and I was sorry to see the  Sisters of the Lone Star end.

Bayleigh &quot;Bay&quot; Stewart is the sensitive middle daughter of Rip Stewart. She can't shoot or fight like either of her sisters, but she can balance the books and be a right-hand to her elder sister, Sloan, who will inherit the plantation upon his death.  When Bay is captured by the  Comanche, it is Long Quiet, a half-breed who's had feelings for her ever  since he saw her back East, who finds her.  He saves the life of a Comanche  chief who has enslaved her and is invited to his village.  Bay has been  with the Comanches for three years, and in that time she has become strong,  but she still dreams of her dream man, Jonas.  But it's not Jonas who  strikes a fire in her blood.  Bay is given to Long Quiet as a gift and she  is fearful at first, but under his gentle hand, she opens her heart to him.   When someone tries to kill her, they escape, and though their feelings for  each other are plain, there is one problem:  he wants to stay in  Comancheria; Bay wants to go back home.  With a heavy heart, Bay goes home,  only to discover that her father is in financial trouble and it's up to her  to fix it, by   marrying Jonas.  There is one complication, though:  she's  pregnant.  Long Quiet comes back into her life and agrees to marry her  (Rip's shotgun was a great motivator), but he believes the only reason she  wanted him was because he was rich, and the story continues to unfold.  I  like the way the author revealed the layers of Bay's acquired strength and  delved into the relationship with her father and elder sister. The way she  managed to show Long Quiet's &quot;uncivilized&quot; Comanche side was  interesting, too.  She also had me guessing as to how she'd resolve the  conflict between Bay and Long Quiet.  This was my favorite book in the  series.	2000-04-27

This story made me anxious to read the next in the series.	2000-04-27

She is redheaded spitfire who could hold her own with wary,  stubborn Flint.  There are some funny scenes between them such as when  Garnet shaves his beard to save his life, and he has the nerve to complain!   The scene where she hits him over the head with a skillet cracked me up,  even though I did feel a little sorry for Flint.

Reese was a no-nonsense, straight-shooter wanted a wife one who would cook, clean, help him with the ranch, give him children, and leave him alone.  His first wife already stomped on his heart and took him for nearly  everything he had, and he wasn't going to be that vulnerable again.  Enter  Madeline, a chic, sophisticated city girl, the very opposite of what he  expects.  Despite their differences, their sense of fascination draws them  to each other and they marry.  The author includes a lot of interesting  facts via Reese and Madeline's wordgames.  She showed that despite their  attraction, they could have an intelligent conversation, and I liked that.   Linda Howard paints an enthralling picture of ranch life and the  relationship between Madeline, who can find her way around a kitchen, and  Reese, a man who believes that the land is all he can count on.  The author  lets us see into the world of a couple who married under unusual  circumstances and how they work out their differences.  I like the way the  author had Madeline leave Reese after he practically screamed at her for  helping him with his ranch. She stays at a place in town and everyday Reese  comes in, asking her to come back.  She won't go until he reveals the  reason why SHOULD come back, and only he knows.	2000-04-27

Though I like horses, the story behind horse racing never really caught my interest.  There's a lot of sabotage in the horse racing industry that I never knew about. Nora made it a little more interesting to me.  I felt the romance between the hero and the heroine was a bit swift.  By the end of the story, the true betrayal will have you saying, &quot;No, it can't be!&quot; The action and drama was enough to keep me flipping the pages.	2000-04-27

I felt for the heroine, who gives up her child born of aweekend affair.  She's been abandoned by her husband, has a mountainof medical bills and has to care for her son, who is dying.  She givescustody of her daughter to the child's father, Daniel, for one year. Now a year is almost up and Daniel doesn't want to give up his child...  I found myself cheering the two on, hoping that they would get past their emotional hurdles and be a family.  I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief, though the road wasn't always smooth. This was my first MP book and I'm still looking for it.	2000-04-27

I liked Cal and Ellie and the way the author set up their relationship.  Cal is a loner and a hardened man, thanks to his late  father, but you can see and feel his love for his mother when he arrives  for her funeral.  His love/hate relationship with his father determines his  solitary adult life, making him wary of letting anyone into his heart.   Then comes Ellie.  She is out to avenge her father's death, a father she's  never met, at the hands of Cal and his uncles (whom she believes are  guilty)and get back the land Cal's uncles won in a card game.  She hires  two matronly ex-prostitutes to pose as her aunts to accompany her to Texas,  where they are supposed to charm Cal's uncles into giving them the land,  but all does not work out as planned.  Someone else is out to destroy them  and take their land, at all costs. I like the way the author made Ellie  strong, yet believably vulnerable at the same time.  Despite her  diminuitive size, she was a match for the tall, blue-eyed Cal, who never  developed any feelings, save lust, for a woman.  As the story moves along  at a fast pace, the snappy, sometimes steamy repartee between the two flows  just as well. Cal discovers that he has more than lustful intentions  towards Ellie, but he's afraid to commit, while Ellie discovers the  passionate side to her nature, but is too proud to settle for being his  mistress.  The other conflict is the land; they both want it, and Ellie's  &quot;aunts&quot; and Cal's uncles come up with a plan.  I like the way the  author also forced Cal (via Ellie) to realize that family WAS what he  needed, by introducing his younger brother, Cord.  It was a riveting story  and I look forward to reading the second book featuring Cord.	2000-04-22

I like the way the heroine got the hero to care about his family.  The only problem I have with the book is that it resembles a lot of her previous stories (ex. the  heroine is usually a red-head with green eyes, the hero has black hair with  green eyes and is a consultant).  I hope she changes her story lines in  future.	2000-02-23
US	51968560	RKZ0N80MAPNTY	0312963300	221323428	Dangerous To Love	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A poignant, sensual read.	I found Ivan and Lucy to be intriguing characters and the author made me care about them.  I've always like stories about the Gyspies, for I believe they are a misunderstoood people.  I felt for Ivan because he was sold to  his uncaring grandmother, who put him in a school where he was abused for  years, just because of his Gypsy blood. The author made me understand  Ivan's motivations and behavior.  I also like Lucy, who was able to stand  up to Ivan and make his see that he was lovable and could love, if he only  let himself.  The way the author created a scene of closure between him and  his grandmother was also good.  She helped to free him and that's what he  needed.	2000-01-30
US	51968560	R1DVK5EBPCYVVY	0312956088	340009983	Heart of the Storm	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A definite keeper!	I really enjoyed this book.  The hero, Cyprian Dare, kidnaps Eliza and her cousin Aubrey, who happens to be his half-brother.  Their father deserted Cyprian's mother years ago and now Cyprian wants revenge.  The hero decides  he wants Eliza for as long as he's holding her captive and Eliza (who  suffers from timidity and asthma) finds herself becoming physically  stronger and not-so-timid because of this experience, wants him, too.  The  love scenes between them are explosive and erotic as Cyprian teaches Eliza  the passionate side of her nature.  Cyprian tries to hide his growing love  Eliza by using sex and he even asks her to stay with him indefinitely.  I  like the way the author got Eliza to let Cyprian release her, even though  he wanted her to stay.  I also like the way they work through his issues of  trust and feelings of betrayal with her family.  I like the way the author  showed how the father's actions affected Cyprian, and even Aubrey, and how  one should take care of their responsibilities and treat others the way  they'd want to be treated.   I'd read it again.	2000-01-30
US	51968560	R12NE1SLO79F1	0312928785	138134724	Gypsy Lord	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An entertaining read.	I liked the fire between Catherine and Dominic.  I also liked the way the author described Gyspy life.  It had more detail than any other story I've read about them.  The author humanized the characters, especially Dominic.   The only thing that troubled me was his vow never to have children just to  spite his father.	2000-01-30
US	51968560	R33W8PNVOYE6O7	0380775476	218257039	Gabriel's Bride	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Hurray for the heroine.	I found Gabriel's Bride to be suspenseful, but the romance was not all that believable.  Gabriel was a bitter man because his mother died and his father never loved either of them.  Because of this, he swayed between  treating Cassie like dirt and trying to seduce her.  I like the way the  author made Cassie a fiery and outspoken woman and how she brought Gabriel  and his father together.  The romance between Cassie and Gabriel was a bit  rugged and I disliked the way he was always threatening or trying to  humiliate her.  Though I didn't find this story to be as good as her  others, I would still buy Samantha James books.	2000-01-30
US	51968560	R36W7YJV9BLTRG	0380805863	560152612	His Wicked Ways	Books	3	6	7	N	N	A slow read in the beginning that picks up speed.	This book didn't capture my interest as fast as the author's other books.  The first 150 or so seemed to go by slowly, but once the characters arrive at his castle, that's when the action begins.  The setting is filled with  suspicion and betrayal, because the two main characters' families have been  feuding for about one hundred years, yet no one knows why.  I like the way  the author created the bond between Meredith and Cameron's sister-in-law,  and also with the other women in the castle.  I also like the way she  developed the love and trust between the two main characters.  I look  forward to reading more books from her in the future.	2000-01-30
US	51968560	R1UE99XJ9KI0MJ	0380786095	26917620	One Moonlit Night	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A steamy, poignant and moving story.	This was the first book I read by Samantha James and I was very touched by it. The hero was sexy and kind to the people, despite their wariness of him.  The way she represented the village people's prejudice was very  accurate and I felt for Dominic.  She portrayed him as a man who feels just  like anyone else, despite his stern exterior.  The electricity between him  and Olivia was extremely good, but I also liked the tenderness between them  as well.  I liked the way the author gradually began to wear away the  heroine's prejudice and the secondary love story with the heroine's sister  was good, too. I'm hoping there will be a sequel.	1999-09-12
US	51968560	R2YP144UZAS3GT	0380786087	238827343	A Promise Given	Books	4	22	24	N	N	A story of passion, mystery and tenderness.	Sabrina and Ian have known each other since they were children, but Ian goes away for several years, and Sabrina is left feeling bitter because she believes he broke a promise to her.  Ian is betrothed to her older sister  Margaret, but when she disappears, he takes Sabrina as his bride. Needless  to say, she is unhappy about this, but finds herself attracted to him  anyway.  I liked both of the characters.  Ian is a hard man because of the  battles he's been in and because of the mystery surrounding his father's  death.  Sabrina is a strong-willed woman who speaks her mind, something a  woman of her time was not supposed to be. Their clashing personalities made  for good reading.  This is a story I'd read over and over again.	1999-09-12

I felt for the heroine, who's been cheated out of her inheritance by her stepmother and lied to by the hero's brother.  Morgan had to be the strong one in the family all his life, while  his brother shirked responsibility.  He marries the heroine to protect her  good name, but discovers that he's having feelings for her that are not  expected ... or welcome.  I found the characters to be multi-dimensional  and the author weaves a mystery into the story without slowing it down or  interrupting the romantic flow.  I think I'll be a Samantha James fan for a  long time.	1999-09-12

I'm glad Ms. Miller's returned to writing historical romances, but although this one was good enough for me to complete, I felt as if I had been left dangling.  There didn't seem to be as much fire between the heros  and heroines, unlike her other books.  I hope her next historical will be  better.	1999-02-14

I found Cherish to be a bit slower than the author's other books, and a bit more violent.  There was always an impending sense of doom.  Nevertheless, I fell in love with Race, who was a hero with sharp edges.   He shows Rebecca patience when she needs it, and seems to know when to push  her when she appears to be falling apart.  I especially liked the love  scene between them.  I almost laughed out loud when the heroine talks about  Keats and Race's &quot;manly business.&quot;	1999-02-14
