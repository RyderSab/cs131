But while this memoir has moments that are delightful, too much is tedious, overwritten, a lot of detail that never gets anywhere, and seemingly endless \\"He did this and I did that and how funny/silly/clever we were.\\"  Overall it reads like a pastiche slapped together just to get a book out.	2005-07-16

Ms. Kamen is an excellent writer and I enjoyed her spirit and her wit, which she never over-uses as some writers do.  She takes a massive amount of information and experience and integrates it in a meaningful way, which is an enormous accomplishment.  I have had chronic migraines (though nothing as unremitting as hers), and learned a lot from this book.	2005-05-02

So often an exotic setting becomes more important than the characters, but although India is intriguing in Bacon's writing it does not override the story.  For me the characters have remained vivid long after I finished the book, and I hated to see it end. My only reservation is that I couldn't make sense of the mother's behavior toward her children, which didn't seem to fit the interpretation her daughter comes to.  But I like puzzling it over, and appreciate a novel that makes me do that.	2004-05-19

Ten chapters, mostly in dialogue, relate the funny, real-life experiences of two characters who go to Perugia to study Italian at l'Universit per Stranieri.  Having gone there myself, I recognized many situations and places, and could relate to the often frustrating challenges adjusting to the Italian way of doing things -- at times I laughed out loud, particularly at Roscoe's attitude.  It is written well and I found the exercises at the end of each chapter useful.  The illustrations add a nice touch.  This would be a good supplemental reader for an intermediate student of Italian.	2004-04-05

Having lived in Rome, I don't agree at all with much of the author's perspective (one example: he brags that Roman women dress fairly formally, to the max -- but observation on the streets, restaurants, theater etc. shows that as in other European cities, some dress up, most don't.  A small point perhaps, but revealing of a limited vantage point)  Much of the book seems mostly about his ego.	2002-11-04

What does that mean? I could as easily say for myself that \\"as a woman and (former) Buffalonian I prefer feelng cool to feeling warm.\\" And she stacks the deck in her contrast of feeling warm to cold -- not the more accurate warm/cool or hot/cold pairing.<BR> Frequent statements like those criticizing Americans explicitly or implicity, e.g. for \\"ignoring or forgetting the old ways of coping with the summer heat\\" (p. 115), or that \\"naturally occuring seasonal heat...was not immediately or conceived as problem for which a technological solution might be discovered\\" (p. 17) are examples of Ackerman's diatribe against air conditioning seen as a plot to impose an artifical, destructive world.

This biography is strong on the first part of Indira's life -- her disjointed childhood and dedication to her father, Nehru, and his democratic ideals.  When she becomes prime minister, however, the book becomes a series of facts about her sudden about-face in creating an anti-democratic, power-grabbing, corrupt regime.  There is a lot of information but not much interpretation, or at times enough explanation of factions and conflicts that have divided India.  Nevertheless, for someone who knows little about the country, this provided an introduction.	2002-07-08

The opening section, about Norris' feelings of marginality as she enters Bennington and then later works in New York, are mildly interesting, although lacking in depth.

I enjoyed reading this book, but was stunned at the contradiction to the reality of Artemesia's life.  Although fictionalized biography by definition takes liberties with the subject's life, it makes no sense for example: 1) to portray Artemesia with only one child (she had 4), 2) to portray that daughter with no interest in painting (her surviving daughter was a painter), 3) to have Artemesia return to Rome alone with her daughter (in reality she returned with her husband), 4) to portray Artemesia's marriage as breaking up much earlier than it did in reality.  To me these distortions change so much about Artemesia that the book becomes pointless.  It puzzles me because Vreeland is a good enough writer to be able to carry a story without contracting essential facts.	2002-02-26

But the memoir seems disconnected when it then  jumps to her young adulthood after her parents' deaths, as she lives a  rowdy, promiscuous life in Spain for some years.  Somehow this is meant to  connect to her guilt about her parents' deaths, but it is unclear,  superficial and repetitively tedious.  Also, references to issues that seem  important to her(e.g., sexual identity) are not followed up. Barrington is  a good writer, and I expected a better crafted memoir.	2000-04-15

It is an exquisite rendering of the inner-outer  life split of an old woman attached in memory to her husband, and attached  by the strings of family to her relatives, who threaten her life desires.

Instead it dwells excessively on market and price manipulation detail while skimming over the social-cultural aspects promised in the  title.  Yet it does have interesting photographs, and makes clear the  extreme oppression of coffee workers in contrast to the U.S. insistence  that paying a few cents more for coffee is impossible and justifies  military support for brutal regimes.  There are frustrating small questions  that I would expect a book with this title would do more than mention,  e.g., why does France, with its extreme emphasis on the importance of high  quality food and taste, traditionally use a high percentage of the most  inferior coffee beans to make lousy coffee?   I also find the author's  moralizing rather off-putting (although I don't disagree with his  positions), and his inclusion in the body of the text of the 800 number for  just one specific coffee company seems inappropriate.  The author doesn't  seem to have been able to really focus on what he wanted the book to be.	1999-06-13
