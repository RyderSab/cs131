Toby Harper, night shift supervisor of Springer Hospital's emergency room, comes under administration's intense scrutiny and is called onto the carpet in front of a hospital board inquiry after a patient suffering from tremors and confusion walks out of the hospital and disappears. When the home health care aide who is taking care of her ailing elderly mother resigns and a colleague seeks to use the missing patient incident as a reason to dismiss Harper, stress turns Harper's job in a big city hospital into a daily battle for survival. As a second patient presents with the same symptoms and dies in the frantic chaos of a crash \\"Code Blue\\", Harper's investigation turns stress into full-blown crisis as she uncovers a conspiracy related to an illicit hormone therapy program at an upscale home for the aged.<br /><br />As she did in Harvest, Gerritsen uses her experience in the medical field to flesh out a superb plot with chilling realism - the ever present fear of litigation as the smallest error can be considered in the light of hindsight outside the chaos of the emergency room; the heart breaking experience of watching Alzheimer's deprive a loved one of their memories and their faculty for independent living; the frightening symptoms of the rare and fatal neurodegenerative diseases carried by the newly discovered not quite alive prions, BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease); the extraordinary pressure exerted by pro-life groups on abortion clinics and those mothers wishing to terminate pregnancies; the lightning pace of unfolding events in a \\"Code Blue\\" emergency; the messy, harsh reality of an autopsy; and much more.<br /><br />At the same time as the plot unfolds with such incredible speed, we witness a heart-warming set of extremely well-constructed characters come to grips with the dynamics of their relationships - Harper struggles with her homemaker sister, Vickie, over the time and difficulties involved with the care of their confused mother; a black Dr Robbie Brace and his white red-haired wife struggle with the cruel ostracism they receive as a result of their mixed race marriage; Daniel Dvorak, the medical examiner, faces inner turmoil as the legal requirements of his position conflict with his growing fondness for Toby Harper; Carl Wallenburg seeks professional revenge for the slight he perceives on his competence as Harper questions his judgment over the handling of a case.<br /><br />A fact-paced, compelling page turner that proves Harvest was not a fluke and Gerritsen is here to stay!

Major Joe \\"Mack\\" Makatozi, a full blooded Sioux and skilled experimental pilot is captured and sent to a top-secret prison camp in the depths of Siberia when his aircraft is forced down over a hostile cold war Russia. His escape over the wire and his flight into the hostile environment of winter Siberia triggers a nation wide manhunt spearheaded by the commandant of the camp, Colonel Arkady Zamatev (who is all too aware of the harsh \\"career-limiting\\" results of mistakes in Communist Russia) and Alekhin, a skilled and ruthless Yakut tracker who has never yet failed to reel in an escapee, more often dead than alive.<br /><br />Initially confident that they can corral their man in short order, Zamatev and Alekhin fail to realize how quickly Mack's indomitable Sioux spirit, his lust for life and his astounding survival skills, learned during his upbringing as a Sioux warrior, will come to the surface and allow him to evade capture over a two year period. Hunting with a handmade bow and arrows, preparation of emergency camps, astonishing hair's breadth escapes, lethal traps set to confound the small army on his trail, construction of leather breeches and moccasins in the field, fire-starting, extreme cold weather survival skills, fording of rivers, cross-country navigation and much, much more are described with an exciting sense of realism and adventure that never falls into the trap of portraying Mack as invincible.<br /><br />The ending is a grim one that is based on Mack's historical sense of native justice and retribution against his tormenter, Alekhin, and provides a very satisfying completion to Last of the Breed as a stand alone novel. But his sworn revenge against Zamatev and his relationship with Natalya Baronas, a Russian peasant he met in his flight to the Bering Strait remain open and unresolved. Sadly, the obvious plans for a sequel will never come to fruition as L'Amour has passed away.<br /><br />Nay-sayers and detractors will point out that L'Amour ignored some pretty obvious tools that would have likely resulted in Mack's almost certain re-capture - dogs, infrared thermography and high resolution satellite imagery are three possibilities that come to mind immediately. But then we wouldn't have had a perfectly delightful, fast-paced, exciting adventure to read, would we? Detractors be damned - it was a great story!

For my money, Clive Cussler is a former heavyweight world champion in the thriller department! But in Golden Buddha, he's reduced himself to the status of an overweight, out of shape punch drunk fighter that just doesn't know when to hang up the gloves and retire!<br /><br />As a musican and former guitar teacher I took personal insult at one point in the story! Cussler would have his readers believe it is possible for a collection of non-musician mercenaries to substitute themselves for a professional band, lip-synch three sets of rock music and fake the instrument playing sufficiently well to stand up to the scrutiny of a few hundred people in close proximity at a private party! Give your head a shake, Clive!<br /><br />For Juan Cabrillo, the chairman of the Corporation, a collection of high-tech wizards and mercenaries, think Mr Phelps of former Mission Impossible fame! Monica Crabtree is a slutty version of Barbara Bain with boobs on steroids! If that comparison seems a little silly, keep it in mind when you try reading Golden Buddha if you feel like you've got a few hours to blow on something that just doesn't make the grade! Some of the one liners will give you a wan smile or two but, frankly, I was generally uncertain as to whether Cussler was trying to be serious or trying to satirize himself and the thriller genre. It doesn't matter - whichever one you believe it is - Cussler didn't succeed anyway!<br /><br />The thing that makes me angrier than anything else is that I've already purchased The Trojan Odyssey. So I will read it but unless Cussler pulls a real rabbit out of his hat, he's off my list! Maybe I can persuade a second hand book store to give me a buck or two to take them off my hands.	2005-09-27

City is a masterpiece of creative genius crafted in Simak's trademark soft-spoken, pastoral style - a breath of fresh air contrasted against today's hard-boiled, fast-paced and typically cynical style of writing.<br /><br />A series of loosely joined short stories is presented as the myths and legends that are told by dogs around their campfires to each other and their pups in a future so distant that no dog is actually certain that the creature Man ever really truly existed. From the standpoint of the reader, City represents a Michener or Rutherfurd style multi-generational family saga - a future history, in other words. Mankind, as represented by the Webster family and their robot, Jenkins, is seen as ascending to marvelous heights of technological achievement while evolving away from a traditional city style government, travelling to the stars and beyond, but ultimately descending into an agoraphobic, dystopian Spartan existence and disappearing into extinction. Jenkins - a ten thousand year old repository of flawless electronic memory and the only remaining human artifact - knows the true story of man's rise and fall but, acting in a fashion distinctly unlike anything Asimov might have attributed to a robot, keeps it to himself. Jenkins has concluded he owes canine society an opportunity to grow and flourish on its own unaware of the fact that dogs were once nothing more than pets to a mean-spirited and violent race of humans.<br /><br />Although City contemplates a lonely ending to mankind as a species, hard core tech weenie sci-fi fans will rub their hands with glee as they read of Simak's imagination and prescience at work - automatic lawnmowers, atomic powered private planes, televisor ports, laboratories and manned bases on Venus, Jupiter and Pluto, an inter-stellar expedition to Alpha Centauri, the demise of natural farming fuelled in part by the rise of mass production hydroponics, ICBMs, inter-dimensional transportation, fireplaces reduced to an anachronistic self-indulgence, suspended animation called \\"The Sleep\\" as a psychologically gentler form of suicide, and, of course, thinking, sentient robots as servants and work mates.<br /><br />To draw on a cosmological metaphor, the ending for man that Simak tells of is not the violent, catastrophic big crunch type ending that would see us wiped out in a blaze of glory. He rather talks of a much bleaker, almost unbearably sad ending to humanity as it simply disappears - the infinite boredom of heat death, as it were, as all motion ends and the universe reaches a boundless uniformity with the maximization of entropy. Simak is blistering in his criticism of man's arrogant opinion of his own place in the world, a theme he will return to again and again in such novels as \\"Time is the Simplest Thing\\" and \\"Time and Again\\":<br /><br />\\"But man had changed. He had lost the old knowledge and old skills. His mind had become a flaccid thing. He lived from one day to the next without any shining goal.

In the course of investigating a death that most considered accidental, Thomas Pitt, Superintendent of the Bow Street Station, compiles a package of damning circumstantial evidence that sends John Adinett to the gallows for the murder of his friend, Martin Fetters - traveler, antiquarian, and a vocal anti-royalist with strong republican sentiments. While the evidence leaves no question in the minds of the jurors as to guilt, Pitt can see no reason why Adinett would have murdered his long-time friend and is unsatisfied with the results of his investigation. Adinett's cronies, members of a shadowy cabal known as the \\"Inner Circle\\" whose secret membership and pledge of loyalty to one another includes men from the highest level of English society exact a swift, brutal revenge on Pitt for Adinett's execution. He is removed from his command in Bow Street Station and exiled to an undercover operation with the Special Branch in Spitalfields, a grimy London slum, looking for elusive evidence of the operations of anarchists.<br /><br />Pitt is forced to live away from his family. In order to clear his name, to prove him right and to allow Pitt to return to hearth and home, his canny, strong minded, and very feminine wife, Charlotte, their tough cockney maid, Gracie, her beau, Sergeant Tellman, and their aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, seek out the mysterious missing motive for Fetters' murder. They uncover a frightening Inner Circle conspiracy to foment violent revolution in working class England, destroy the monarchy and replace the existing government with a republic, a senate and a president. While every reader will have no doubt the climax of the story will wrap up Charlotte's and Thomas' separate investigations neatly into a single conclusion, Perry has pulled a real rabbit out of her hat by tying the Inner Circle's nefarious revolutionary ideas into the gruesome Whitechapel Ripper killings with an exciting and novel re-interpretation of the long-standing theory that Jack was a member of the Royal family.<br /><br />Less focused on Victorian atmosphere and scenery than usual, Perry has used The Whitechapel Conspiracy to concentrate on development of her key characters. The relationship between Gracie and Tellman, in particular, is heartwarming and no reader will fail to cheer them on as they come to the realization that they care for one another deeply but remain uncertain as to how to act on their growing affection for one another. The plot, a realistic believable political thriller, is cleverly drawn on the real life Victorian working man's disgust with Prince Albert's profligate spending habits and dissolute lifestyle and the increasing distance and isolation between Queen Victoria and her subjects. The labyrinthine twists and turns that finally disclose the identity of the bad guys in the Inner Circle but leave the identity of the Ripper a continuing mystery are ingenious and surprising without being forced or contrived.<br /><br />Perry has produced another winner that will thrill Thomas and Charlotte's legion of followers.t Jack was a member of the Royal family. <br /> <br />Less focused on Victorian atmosphere and scenery than usual, Perry has used The Whitechapel Conspiracy to concentrate on development of her key characters.

Not once! Not twice! Lots of times! Top secret government agency is staffed by a few megalomaniacs with some variation on a plot to take over the world. Whistleblower catches on. Bad guys realize that whistleblower is onto them. Whistleblower takes it on the lam fleeing for his life with a sex or love interest in tow. Good guy, previously a mild, meek mannered individual discovers that he has the combined survival and killing skills of a Green Beret, a Navy SEAL, a Ninja and a Marine Commando! Hero proceeds to wreak havoc on the insane plans of the megalomaniacs and saves the world! Tale concludes on happy ever after love-making, of course.<br /><br />The good news is that the devil is in the details! Despite the basic \\"been there, done that\\" nature of the plot, Iles has produced a lightning fast-paced tale with some incredibly novel twists and turns and philosophical musings that make this a compelling page turner lying somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle between soft sci-fi, hard sci-fi and pure techno-thriller!<br /><br />The plot? Dr. David Tennant, an ethicist from the University of Virginia medical school has been appointed by the White House to work with the top-secret Trinity artificial intelligence project. Incredibly high resolution molecular copies of the brains of the participating Nobel laureate scientists obtained through advanced magnetic resonance imaging scans will provide the basis for the quasi-human operating system of a new quantum computer with speeds and capabilities several orders of magnitude beyond current computers. When Tennant attempts to put the project onto a temporary hold because of neurological side effects caused by the MRI scans, such as his own narcoleptic seizures, the team fractures and it becomes clear that the power hungry owners of the project will stop at nothing to bring Trinity to completion! Tennant and his psychiatrist, Dr Rachel Weiss, flee for their lives and the chase is on. This thriller comes to a conclusion with Tennant attempting to reason with a \\"live\\" Trinity computer who needs to be convinced of a reason to trigger the self-destruct mechanism on nuclear missiles that are now racing towards their targets in the USA!<br /><br />Some pretty meaty stuff in this novel for those that like their sci-fi good and hard! Aside from the computer itself, there's MRI scans that can produce 3-D images of the brain with resolution to the molecular level; satellite based weaponry; holographic storage of memory written by lasers into the structure of stable crystals; and, the hypothesis of the existence of anti-space as a possible solution to the ongoing puzzle of spooky action at a distance and quantum entanglement. Those readers that prefer their sci-fi to lean more in the soft, philosophical direction will be pleased to know that the entire novel is a cautionary tale on the ethics of the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence with some very compelling, extended discussion on the very nature and existence of God and evil.<br /><br />Enjoy!

With no small amount of national pride, I'm thrilled to report that mere superlatives somehow seem insufficient to convey Gray's debut success with The Fiend in Human.<br /><br />Edmund Whitty is a profligate, dissolute freelance journalist who has succumbed to every known Victorian vice save womanizing - snuff, cigarettes, gin, opium, laudanum, and Acker's Chlorodine (a potent mixture of opium, marijuana and cocaine in alcohol!) Despite having achieved a measure of journalistic fame and public notoriety by assigning the moniker \\"Chokee Bill\\" to William Ryan, currently awaiting execution for the strangulation and grisly mutilation of five ladies of questionable virtue, Whitty struggles with an ongoing desperate need to produce the income required to stave off gambling debtors who won't hesitate to use a physical beating to persuade payment. In the course of searching out new \\"crisp copy\\", lurid sensational pieces he can submit to his tight-fisted editor, he meets the impoverished Henry Owler, a \\"patterer\\" who wishes to render Ryan's last confession before his hanging into \\"true crime\\" verse. But Ryan (not unlike other convicted criminals, of course) protests he is innocent and circumstances begin to persuade Owler and Whitty that Ryan is indeed telling the truth. The signature white scarf killings have continued, swept under the carpet and hushed up by one and all - the police, the merchants, the petty criminals and even the poverty stricken residents of the local neighbourhood! Whitty in a desperate bid to achieve real fame in a fading, limpid journalistic career and financial freedom from the debtors who are relentlessly hounding him, decides to stake all on proving Ryan's innocence.<br /><br />Gray has masterfully married the ascerbically witty, comic and always flowery Dickensian dialogue with Anne Perry's superb, elegant atmospheric descriptions of Victorian London life and then improved both by taking a step down into a much grittier, earthier representation of real characters living real lives. Two gentlemen Oxford swells pass wastrel days around gaming, sex and booze. The pain and wretched difficulties of daily life in a London slum are portrayed in exquisite, graphic detail that might warrant a warning to sensitive viewers were the medium television instead of a novel. Older female chaperones, quaintly termed \\"confidential friends\\", are employed to protect the nominal virtue of young ladies of marriageable age. The surviving local champion bare-knuckles boxer is portrayed as a friendly publican quite capable of acting as his own bouncer. Steet walkers and hookers are picked up by \\"gentleman\\" johns with a ritualized stylized dialogue and negotiation that, by today's standards, is absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />You'll be treated, for example, to Gray's wonderful Dickensian variation on a simple theme that you and I would have written as simply \\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\":<br /><br />\\"For in truth there exists no young female (charwoman or countess, schoolgirl or flower-seller) in London who does not exist in some male mind as a tantalizing fantasy, in whose honour some schoolboy does not regularly engage in self-abuse - fantasy which, when he becomes an old boy, he will seek to make real. Hence, the relation between the brothel and the theatre: success in both depends upon one's observation of the world, of the human mind, as well as one's own outward identity in the calligraphy of sex.\\"<br /><br />The whodunit succeeds admirably with a couple of superb twists reserved until the final pages. In fact, the final twist, a brilliant piece of mis-direction by Gray, is held in reserve until the very last paragraph! On a somewhat deeper level, Gray manages, like Dickens, to also make probing critical comment on a number of issues without disrupting the flow of the story in the slightest. For example, his criticism of the ethics of journalists and the vested interest they have in creating news where none necessarily exists is quite apparent.<br /><br />What a find!

In a word, Silent Partner is magnificent!<br /><br />Child psychologist, Alex Delaware, is living life in the dumps temporarily separated from his lover, Robin, who has asked for some space and time to find herself. On a last minute whim, he attends a society soir&eacute;e and encounters Sharon Ransom, a former girlfriend who makes it abundantly clear that she'd like to meet and re-connect with Alex. Uncertain of either of their motives and feeling to do so would needlessly complicate his life, Alex declines but is horrified to discover the next day that Sharon has taken her own life. No doubt driven by intense feelings of guilt, Alex embarks on an investigation of the circumstances of her suicide and walks into a tangled weave of multiple murder, corporate shenanigans, drugs, sex, pornography and psychological mayhem that only a writer of Kellerman's skill could conceive of and actually keep under control.<br /><br />Over and over again, Kellerman catches his readers with a delicously nasty habit - the details seems complete, the explanations are in hand and the story appears headed for a d&eacute;nouement - then the twist happens and we're tossed back into the thick of things. And, this happens not just once but two or three times in the space of the final hundred pages.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this is a fine murder thriller, perhaps Kellerman's best, the violence actually takes second place to the psychological drama and the narration of a wealth of detail about the art of psycho-analysis. Sharon Ransom's case study, for example, that she submitted as her PhD thesis was positively chilling and I have no doubt could be a reflection of the distressing reality that analysts encounter with more seriously disturbed clients.<br /><br />If you're going to start Silent Partner, make sure you've got a few spare hours carved out and already set aside. You won't want to put it down!	2005-09-01

Pure hard-driving action! Pure plot! That's the good news! The bad news? London Bridges reads like a high speed jet boat ride in the very shallow end of a very large swimming pool. No depth! No character! No development! No background! No scenery!<br /><br />Patterson is certainly capable of much, much better! But, for many readers (including myself, I'll confess) London Bridges will come up to a passing grade, depending on your mood and what you're after at the time! (I happened to be in exactly the right mood when I picked this one up) Like a rock-em, sock-em made-for-television thriller drama, this novel requires absolutely no attention or effort to follow and the action and the plot is more than enough to absorb you completely and pull you from first page to the last! (Did I hear somebody say \\"screenplay\\"?) And the plot? A detailed outline for this type of novel just isn't necessary. You'll get exactly what you'd expect - mass murder, assassination, nuclear weapons, terrorism, Russian mafia, extortion, snipers, assault teams, megalomania, globetrotting, CIA, FBI, Homeland Security and more!<br /><br />Oops! Silly me! Did I say there was no character development? Strictly speaking, that isn't quite true. In a moment of weakness, Alex acknowledged that he was \\"smitten\\" with his newly found lady friend, detective Jamilla Hughes. Like so many other men, he just couldn't seem to find it in himself to use the \\"L\\" word! And, he certainly continues to demonstrate that, despite his dedication to the job, he is the consummate family man.<br /><br />I haven't read Big Bad Wolf yet and it's been a long time since I read Pop Goes the Weasel. Despite that, I don't think I missed a thing as references to the Weasel and the Wolf as bad guys in London Bridges seemed forcibly shoe-horned into the story to provide some sort of affected continuity to the saga of Alex Delaware's life.<br /><br />High literature, this ain't! But, what the heck! Put your feet up, let yourself relax and turn the pages quickly! It's practically unavoidable. Think of London Bridges as a giant vacuum cleaner - it'll pull you along like an irresistible force but, ultimately ... it still just sucks!n the pages quickly! It's practically unavoidable.

The drill with Asimov's Black Widower mysteries (in music circles, one might call these \\"divertimenti\\") is well known to dedicated fans. Six members of the Black Widowers Club (chauvinists one and all, \\"no women allowed\\", if you puhhlease!) meet once a month at their club for a gourmet dinner. The members of the group - a lawyer, a cryptographer, a math teacher, a chemist, a mystery writer, and Henry, their inestimable waiter - never fail to ferret out an interesting mystery, theft, disappearance, swindle or some other form of interesting puzzle during the grilling of their dinner guest which invariably starts with the formula question \\"How do you justify your existence?\\" Despite the collective intelligence of the group (which Asimov humorously portrays them as being inordinately proud of), the solution of the puzzle always seems just beyond their grasp. Henry, in a quiet, self-effacing manner that doesn't quite succeed in covering his own serving of pride, comes to the rescue with the solution and the explanations for the other members and readers alike!<br /><br />Readers of previous Black Widower shorts will be thrilled to return to the publication of this posthumous \\"best of\\" collection plus a handful of previously unpublished works by the good doctor! Cynicism, word play, jokes, puns, locked room mysteries, irony, sarcasm and other quiet diversions take centre stage. Don't look for violence, mayhem or thrills in this collection. They're just not there. Almost certainly, readers will twig to some of the solutions before Henry provides the answers and those brighter armchair sleuths will undoubtedly indulge in a little chuckling at the expense of the members. Other times, Henry's explanation will result in the proverbial slap in the forehead - \\"Now why didn't I think of that!\\" In either event, every story in the collection will provide ten to fifteen minutes of thoroughly enjoyable diversion from this hectic work-a-day world and a satisfied smile at its conclusion.<br /><br />Give yourself a treat and add some of Asimov's gentle humour to your bookshelf.ve yourself a treat and add some of Asimov's gentle humour to your bookshelf.	2005-08-25

The Third Translation is not an easy book to like!<br /><br />Our hero, Walter Rothschild, an Egyptologist at the British Museum, is an ineffectual, pathetic obsessed man, driven only by a passion for his science. Boring and weak, ineffectual as a parent, spouse and lover, indecisive, introverted, fretful and naïve, Walter generates only a vague, disinterested feeling of sympathy in the reader. The plot, on the other hand, at least contains the elements of a story that one might expect should unfold as a thriller! With the help of a powerful cocktail of drugs, alcohol and uninhibited sex, Erin, a beautiful young goth, steals a papyrus from the museum that Walter thinks may contain a vital clue to the translation of the Stela of Paser, a centuries old funerary stone. A rather stumbling investigation leads Walter to the acquaintance of Penelope, a staffer from the British Library, who helps him track the thief into the lair of a modern day Egyptian cult.<br /><br />Like the earnest, trendy young people who mill about London's arty Soho district where some of Bondurant's tale is based, The Third Translation is much too ardent and takes itself entirely too seriously. Or, at least, that's what I thought at first! But, it was Walter's daughter, Zenobia, indulging in a mouthful of babbling double-speak that made me realize Bondurant was yanking on the chain of London's intelligentsia  sub-culture. She spoke of her new business venture, a women's magazine:<br /><br />\\"While I was doing my master's at Columbia, she said, I discovered that most women's studies and humanities departments were engaged in a form of hypocritical liberal fascism, victimization, and debilitating group-think strategies that eventually were swamped in a morass of ambiguity and academic jargon that prohibited the real ideas present to make a dent in anything beyond the theoretical models. This magazine is intended to change all that.\\"<br /><br />By this point in the novel, it was quite clear that Bondurant was far too skilled a writer to have constructed such meaningless drivel by mistake so, I concluded that he had set out to create it on purpose. Do not judge The Third Translation by the standards of what you were expecting to read. Rather allow it to be what it wants to be. Once that \\"aha\\" light came on for me, the novel, like the endless crescendo in a Rossini overture, built in beauty and moved from one strength to another.<br /><br />And what exactly IS The Third Translation? An eloquent, dramatic description of the current understanding of translation of heiroglyphics from a purely scientific point of view; an even more eloquent philosophical statement about heiroglyphics as a reflection of ancient Egyptian culture; an unrelated series of poetic, artistic asides that use certain features of modern cosmological theories of the universe as metaphors for Egyptian writing; a masterful, darkly comic, literary criticism of London life; an emotional, deeply moving description of a few days in Walter's life as he comes to grips with his inadequacies and failings and attempts to establish a renewed relationship of sorts with his estranged daughter; and, finally, a modest mystery that, in large part, remains unsolved at the conclusion of the narrative. This lack of a real conclusion to the story is, paradoxically, still quite satisfying!<br /><br />Like many other books, enjoyment of The Third Translation does not come with the first page.

In the early years of the 12th century, shortly after Henry I dies without an obvious heir, England is torn by civil war between his daughter, Maud, and her cousin, Stephen of Blois. This unsettled period in England provides the tumultuous setting for a sprawling 50 year epic tale of the construction of a bishop's cathedral at Kingsbridge Priory. Follett uses the history of the era to full advantage and masterfully weaves the fundamental ingredients of 12th century medieval English life into a stirring plot that will keep you reading well into the wee hours - the push and pull of church versus state as bishops tussle with nobility and archbishops and popes squabble with kings or rivals to the throne; the early development of the concept of organized labour and unions; the very tenuous and fluid definition of title and property ownership; the nature of military strategy and the frightful concept of in-close hand to hand combat in the middle ages; markets, trade fairs and the nature of commerce and business licences of the day.<br /><br />Follett has populated this novel with an astonishing cast of memorable characters whose personalities, weaknesses, strengths, habits and physical descriptions are portrayed with a remarkable level of detail - Tom Builder and his wife, \\"witch\\" Ellen; the venal, psychopathic William Hamleigh and his ugly, domineering mother Regan; the kindly, prideful Philip, prior of Kingsbridge; brutish, bullying Alfred; the brilliant and beautiful Aliena and her self-centred brother Richard, tied to each other because of an oath made to their father as he lay on his death bed; the pious but machiavellian Waleran of Bigod who has set his sights on nothing less than the lofty position of Archbishop of Canterbury; and, Jack, Ellen's nerdy good-natured son who matures into a master mason obsessed with expanding the limits of medieval architecture. The good guys will make you laugh, weep and cheer and the bad guys will make your skin crawl. But - trust me - bad or good, you won't be forgetting these folks any time soon!<br /><br />Follett's story-telling is as ambitious as the setting in which he has chosen to place it. Like other modern extended family tales such as Archer's \\"Kane and Abel\\", John Jakes' \\"The Kent Family Chronicles\\" or the classic Dickens' \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\", we are treated to a smorgasbord of emotions and characteristics - love and hate, strength and weakness, devotion and loyalty, dishonour and deceit, intelligence and bone-headed stupidity, altruism and selfishness, stubbornness and obsession, bravery and cowardice.<br /><br />An extraordinary, compelling drama, The Pillars of the Earth deserves to be on your bookshelf.or good, you won't be forgetting these folks any time soon!

Giant cylinders crash to earth, disgorging huge, unearthly creatures armed with heat rays and fighting machines. Amid the boundless destruction they cause, it looks as if the end of the world has come.<br /><br />This novel represents an extraordinary blend of prophetic hard science fiction together with a superb narrative of the human effects of fear, war, mob psychology, courage, arrogance, pride, despair, faith and stupidity among other human strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />The ending represents a new beginning for a humanity that has received a wake-up call and an opportunity to start over with what Huxley would call a \\"brave new world\\".	2005-08-05

In the early years of the nineteenth century, life in the harsh, northern wilderness of Upper and Lower Canada is a mentally and physically demanding pioneering existence made even more difficult and tenuous by the politics of the War of 1812. Rachel Greenhow, a young Quaker from Scotland responds to her calling as a missionary by emigrating to Canada and ministering to the early settlers in Ontario, the voyageurs of the North West Company and the aboriginal native tribes along the fur trade routes between Montreal and Michilimackinac. The realities of pioneer life in the Canadian boreal forest and her faith come into conflict as she falls in love with Mark Mackenzie, a fur trade agent, and marries outside the Society of Friends. Despondent over the loss of her first child and her expulsion from the Society because of her marriage, she wanders into the forest on an island in northern Lake Michigan and disappears without a trace.<br /><br />One might be forgiven for cracking open this novel expecting adventure, a swashbuckling account of a fast-paced rescue and tales of derring-do! In fact, it is anything but! Voyageurs is an exquisitely detailed first person account of Mark Greenhow's two year search for his lost sister with the assistance of Loic Kerners, a mixed breed outdoorsman of Indian and Scottish parents, and Alan Mackenzie, Rachel's husband and agent provocateur under direct orders from General Sir Isaac Brock to recruit native support for Canada inside US territory. While it is certainly not languid or plodding, the pacing of the novel and the enormous volume of the detail might be described as at once overwhelming and tortuous as well as frightening and breathtaking, an apt metaphor for the monumental difficulties that a voyageur of the North West Company might face in his every day working life and the compelling setting in which the story takes place - waterfalls and rapids; excruciating clouds of mosquitoes or black flies; extreme temperature swings; backbreaking 90 to 100 pound loads hauled over strenuous ankle-breaking portages; the open water of the Great Lakes that might better be described as inland oceans when observed from the perspective of a canoe; changeable unpredictable weather; the dumb-founding athleticism of ten to twelve men paddling in perfect synchrony at 50 strokes per minute for hours on end singing, if you please, to provide a rhythm and take their minds off the numbing pain in their backs and shoulders.<br /><br />Voyageurs is peppered throughout with themes of conflict and tension - the yet to be formed Canada versus a newly established US flexing its muscles at only loosely defined borders; a corporate turf war between the North West and the South West fur companies; Quaker moral standards and resolute strictures against alcohol, weapons, licentiousness and fighting constantly under assault by the exigencies of frontier living and simply staying alive in the context of war; European culture versus aboriginal culture; aboriginal peoples already dealing with the broken promises of treaties with the white man; Mark's ongoing moral dilemma of traveling and living with Alan who clearly lives by a code of conduct virtually anathema to the rules of the Society of Friends.<br /><br />The ending comes, in a sense, as an anti-climax. While Rachel's life is resolved in a satisfying, realistic and almost fatalistic fashion, there are readers that will be disappointed by the fact that there is no story book romanticism or heart-rending emotion in Elphinstone's resolution of Mark's exhausting search. She has caught us completely unawares at the end of the novel leaving Mark's journal to simply come to a halt with a series of blank pages. Elphinstone has demonstrated very clearly that, while any individual's life may be described in whole or in part and may even reach a completion of sorts, the conflicts, tensions, issues and events around us usually unfold without any particular reference to us as individuals and will probably continue after we leave the scene - regardless of the form that departure might take!<br /><br />Two thumbs up for a unique story about the fur trade in colonial Canada!continue after we leave the scene - regardless of the form that departure might take!

Paul, a two year old toddler plays happily in the yard while Anna nips inside to take a quick look at Tracy, who's crying and sick in bed with a cold. Only a few moments later, she comes back out to a parent's worst nightmare - Paul is nowhere to be found. Eleven years later, Tom and Tracy have long since given up hope but Anna has remained so completely obsessed with the possibility that Paul is alive and will return to them someday that their family relationships are on the verge of collapse. A family friend, Detective Buddy Ferraro now shocks them with the news that a death bed confession from one of the kidnappers has resulted in Paul being found and returned to his family.<br /><br />Stranger in the House is actually two stories happening simultaneously. Suffice it to say that the \\"thriller\\" half of the tale is monumentally maudlin. MacDonald lets us know who the real villain of the tale is almost from the outset of the story and the only tidbit held in reserve for the climax is the reason.<br /><br />The other story is the evolution of the Lange family after Paul returns. Tom feels tremendous guilt and remorse that he was obviously wrong to have given up hope and yet he cannot get rid of the anger he feels at Anna for having ignored the family for so long. Tracy is a completely normal, sullen, self-centered teenager who is upset at having an instant sibling with whom she is now expected to become friends and share. Anna is delighted at Paul's return and fails to recognize that she continues to be obsessed with her son to the exclusion of her husband and daughter. Paul is tormented with nightmares stemming from his experiences with his kidnappers and initially encounters serious psychological difficulties re-adjusting to his new family - even his name and his birthday are different from what he has grown up with! The drama of these problems and how the family avoids near-certain break-up is extremely well done and is far and away the more interesting of the two parts of the novel.<br /><br />A weak two stars only for the \\"thriller\\", four stars for the \\"family drama\\" - OK, we'll call it a three star rating!done and is far and away the more interesting of the two parts of the novel. <br /> <br />A weak two stars only for the \\"thriller\\", four stars for the \\"family drama\\" - OK, we'll call it a three star rating! <br />	2005-07-26

Nothing deep, subliminal, fancy, or indirect and hidden! The Puppet Masters is straight-up hard driving sci-fi action thriller based on the simple theme of alien invasion! Given the underlying culture of 1950s USA, the deep-seated American fear and paranoia over the Cold War with Russia and Cuba plus the ongoing bewilderment surrounding alleged UFO sightings and alien abductions, there are few surprises in The Puppet Masters. Despite that, Heinlein succeeds in hooking his readers from the very first page and producing a fast-paced tale that is extremely difficult to put down once you've started. Move over \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", \\"War of the Worlds\\" and \\"Day of the Triffids\\" - you've got some exciting new company!<br /><br />Sam and Mary, operatives for an ultra-covert government intelligence agency run by the Old Man, open the story as they are briefed on the arrival of a flying saucer which we will later learn is from Titan, Saturn's sixth and largest moon. The government, with typical bureaucratic blundering and political maneuvering fails to react to the threat against mankind when it is first recognized - the occupants of the flying saucer are a slug-like parasitic lifeform that steals its human host's body, intelligence and memories by attaching itself to a human's back and reproduces at a frightening rate.<br /><br />Although Heinlein primarily used plot and action to drive the story to a thrilling climax and a warm-hearted optimistic conclusion, we are given snippets of his visions of technology and life in a 21st century future - non-habit forming drugs capable of dramatically elongating a person's psychological perception of the passage of time; heat guns; flying cars powered by impellers with one model laughably called the \\"Cadillac Zipper\\"; stereo-video, high resolution pictures and a multi-channel television entertainment universe (well, he sure got that one right, didn't he?); space travel; and, established colonies on Venus. It's difficult to say whether Heinlein was being unabashedly cynical or taking a stab at black humour when he portrayed the state of marriage as having evolved into a purely contractual arrangement with optional renewal after a specified term and payment of a salary from one party to the other.<br /><br />One of the most interesting developments in The Puppet Masters is the government's decision to suspend certain civil liberties - the world's population is forced to live and work in the nude as the only way of ensuring a neighbour has not been hi-jacked by one of the \\"slugs\\". The alternative is being summarily shot by military or police forces, not to mention roaming vigilante groups. How ironic that something written over fifty years ago should suddenly be so timely! In light of recent events such as Al-Qaeda terrorist bombings, Heinlein's outlandish plot device gives one considerable reason to pause, draw a deep breath and contemplate what rights might be sacrosanct and which ones might be changed or eliminated in the world's efforts against terrorism.<br /><br />With the exception of overtly sexist dialogue in the style of a hard-nosed Mike Hammer police procedural, nothing else would date this fine story as having been written so long ago.

Perkar's rash, ham-handed efforts to respond to Hezhi's almost unwitting call for help have opened a hornet's nest of trouble. Their flight from the city of Nohl to escape the Changeling has left behind them a trail of mayhem, death and destruction - Perkar's people, the cattle farmers, and the Mang, accomplished horse breeders, riders and worshippers are now at war; Perkar has slain and beheaded Ghe, the Jik assassin,  but through the intervention of the Changeling's power, Ghe has been resurrected as a powerful ghoul who now claims to \\"love\\" Hezhi; and, in the fashion of the Greek and Roman pantheon, gods and half-gods squabble and tamper with the lives of man but their motives are murky, confusing and a good deal less than altruistic. Karak, the Raven, or the Blackgod, seems to have developed a particular fondness for Perkar, Hezhi and their small band of travelers. Much to Hezhi's utter dismay, fear and anger, he discloses to her that her destiny is at She'leng, the source of the River, where she will find the power to defeat the Changeling. But all Hezhi really wants is to be left alone. As the story unfolds, the gods' relentless tinkering with the world results in nobody knowing who to believe in or who to trust.<br /><br />In The Blackgod, Keyes has moved well beyond The Waterborn and expanded Chosen of the Changeling into a truly mature epic fantasy with amazing breadth and scope. The animist pagan theology introduced in The Waterborn is explored in wonderful depth and detail. In a concept strikingly reminiscent of the Christian idea of Trinity and yet still wonderfully original and imaginative, Perkar's and Hezhi's gods - Balati the One-Eyed Lord, Karak the Raven, Ekama the Horse Mother and the Huntress - are revealed as manifestations of a single god united in their quest to eliminate the incessant, overpowering evil of the Changeling. As the war between them advances to a climax, the Mang and Perkar's people, the cattle farmers, come alive with rich and colourful detail including traditions and beliefs, costumes, history and language. Questions about the history and meaning of the priesthood and their temple in Nhol left unanswered at the end of The Waterborn are resolved with a dazzling twist. Heroes, heroines and villains alike are well-constructed, realistic and are allowed to develop and mature into different characters with strengths, weaknesses and human frailties.<br /><br />Although we are reasonably certain of the eventual \\"winner\\" of the conflict, the story-telling never becomes maudlin or trite and remains entirely unpredictable and compelling. Of course, that has a great deal to do with the fact that until the very end, we're not really certain of who the bad guy really is. I said it about The Waterborn and I'm thrilled to be able to say it again for The Blackgod: \\"An unforgettable fantasy replete with all the requisite elements - a pretty damsel in distress, heroes and their sagas, gods, battles, good and evil, with lots of credible dialogue to bring it home!

Boslough actually summarized the \\"plot\\" superbly in his own preface:<br /><br />\\"This book is the story of what happened along the road to the big bang theory and how it may be a mere will-o'-the-wisp rather than a final destination. The book also seeks to raise a number of questions about the biggest sacred cow of all, the big bang.\\"<br /><br />\\"Masters of Time\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read, appealing to both scientists and non-scientists alike, that succeeds on three separate levels. First, it is a well written history of the development of modern cosmological theory in the 20th century, replete with amusing anecdotes, heroes, villains and goats, false leads and both successful and dead end research. Second, it is a quality primer for the non-scientist on virtually any topic one could name in the field of cosmology - microwave radiation, quasars, pulsars, black holes, cosmic strings, inflation, the great attractor, baryonic matter, lumpy galactic super clusters - the list just goes on and on. Finally, it is a cautionary tale that, in the spirit of Kuhn's discussion of paradigm shifts, suggests the big bang as a theory just may be in a world of trouble - too many unexplained glitches and too many theories that are simply unobservable, untestable or unreproducible. As a specific example, Boslough criticizes Guth's model of inflation in the early universe:<br /><br />\\"The reason for this apparent accuracy in explanatory power was of course simple: The inflationary theories had been created to do exactly this, explain the origin and evolution of the universe in terms that could stand up to observed detail. In the most simple terms, the theories had been constructed in such a way that they could not be disproved.\\"<br /><br />The problem with many of these models is that, while they explain observations with impeccable precision, they make no independent predictions that can be tested by further observation. We may or may not be in for the major paradigm shift that Kuhn predicts is on the way but I certainly agree with Boslough - skepticism and ongoing scrutiny of existing science is healthy. \\"Masters of Time\\" is a great read.

Hugh De Luc and his loving wife, Sophie, peasant vassals under their evil liege lord, Baldwin, Duke of Treille, scratch out a meager living as the owners of the local inn in Veille du P&egrave;re. The papal inducement of a promise of freedom from the grinding servitude of feudalism proves too much to resist and Hugh joins a rag-tag army of Catholic crusaders marching to the Holy Land to retake the city of Jerusalem from the infidels. In the presence of horrific carnage and violence, Hugh undergoes an epiphany of sorts during a battle encounter with a kindly Turk soldier who spares his life. Realizing the futility of what he is doing, Hugh deserts and returns to France only to discover that his infant son has been murdered, his home and inn have been burned to the ground and Sophie has been kidnapped and imprisoned by Norcross, one of Baldwin's bullying minion knights - or so he thinks!<br /><br />With \\"The Jester\\", Patterson and Gross have achieved something very special indeed. Using the setting and background of medieval France and the Crusades, they crafted a finely polished veneer and laid it on precisely thick enough to provide an exciting, believable and entirely unique cover for what actually lies underneath - a tale that is, in fact, 100% modern high-speed thriller. For example, Hugh's skilful adoption of the guise of a jester and his adroit entry into Baldwin's castle is, by any other name, an undercover infiltration operation into the enemy camp! The relic from the Holy Land that Hugh doesn't even realize he carries and that causes so much death around him, could have been, in a more modern story, a piece of microfilm with some critical information worth millions to the holder! Despite so many of the plot pieces being so typical of this type of novel (I'm sure that some would say trite) - weak underdogs rallying to the strength and moral courage of a new leader; a tender scene in which Hugh's wife dies in his arms only minutes after he has found her; newly found love providing a reason to persevere; a sex scene just before the battle with a charging enemy - they are put together in such a fashion as to be irresistible!<br /><br />I'll succumb to a clich&eacute; myself - \\"The Jester\\" was a rollicking great read and I enjoyed it immensely.

Sarabande has set this dark, tragic tale of struggle and survival on the northeast coast of North America during the final days of the last ice age. To the paleo-Indian people of the day, the pace and magnitude of climactic change must have seemed powerful and frightening. Mammoths and mastodons remained but were obviously so well on the path to extinction that they had been elevated to enormous symbolic religious importance. Even for elders, wise shamans and the most accomplished hunters, knowledge such as migratory routes of critical food and resource supplies like caribou, beluga and geese must have seemed fleeting and frustratingly inconsistent. Cree and Inuit people from the Arctic and the unforgiving barrens of northern Quebec and Labrador, the beginnings of the Ojibway, Algonquin and Iroquois nations that found themselves more at home in the woodlands of southern Ontario and Quebec or upstate Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, plus the eastern maritime ancestors of the Micmac tribe meet, intermingle, mate and breed, battle for territorial and cultural supremacy, trade, pray and make offerings to their gods, kill or help one another, and live and die.<br /><br />Sarabande fills in her panoramic, complex canvas with all the attention of the most assiduous realism painter. Tiny, single brush strokes are made with the greatest of care and no detail is too small to be included in her exquisite portrayal of this pre-historic North American landscape - the slate gray colour of the sky during a powerful late winter storm; the sickly, smell of rotting meat on the hoof as a dying mammoth searches for a final resting place; the rich, sweet colour and taste of sap rising in spring maples; the incredible development of the bow and arrow as a weapon capable of striking from a distance, terrifying hunters who know only the lesser power of a stone-tipped spear; the first hesitant use of metallic copper in weaponry, commerce and art; tattoos, jewellery and all the finery of aboriginal costumes.<br /><br />In the foreground of this stunning canvas, she paints the portrait of M'alsum - a venal, self-important, cowardly, almost psychopathic headman. M'alsum abandons his youngest brother, Ne'gauni, trapped in a deadfall, dying of wounds sustained in an attack by a tribe of northern hunters foraging far out of their regular territory in the barrens. In the same raid, his mate, Hasu'u, is kidnapped and forced to serve as wet nurse to a motherless infant. M'aslum, adds self-pity, self-doubt and avarice to his list of failings and murders his two other brothers whom he sees as competitors to his position as chief.<br /><br />Sarabande's description of a woodland tribesman's courageous stand against the charging mammoth and M'alsum's cowardly flight from the same beast ultimately leading it by chance over a steep embankment to its death was absolutely breathtaking. The development of the characters of the Old One and her grand-daughter, Mowea'qua, as members of a very hairy, bone-deep ugly race on which modern native werewolf mythology might have been based is essentially a whimsical flight of fancy but, frankly, I found it particularly charming.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented that they thought the story particularly cruel or savage. In an unapologetic afterword, Sarabande herself suggests that if her portrayal was harsh, it only reflected her genuine beliefs of what life was like at that time based on her extensive research into the findings of archeologists, historians, anthropologists, geologists and meteorologists. She goes on to suggest that it is perhaps to our credit that we are shocked and appalled when we read of such things.

M'aslum, adds self-pity, self-doubt and avarice to his list of failings and murders his two other brothers whom he sees as competitors to his position as chief. <br /> <br />Sarabande's description of a woodland tribesman's courageous stand against the charging mammoth and M'alsum's cowardly flight from the same beast ultimately leading it by chance over a steep embankment to its death was absolutely breathtaking. The development of the characters of the Old One and her grand-daughter, Mowea'qua, as members of a very hairy, bone-deep ugly race on which modern native werewolf mythology might have been based is essentially a whimsical flight of fancy but, frankly, I found it particularly charming. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have commented that they thought the story particularly cruel or savage. In an unapologetic afterword, Sarabande herself suggests that if her portrayal was harsh, it only reflected her genuine beliefs of what life was like at that time based on her extensive research into the findings of archeologists, historians, anthropologists, geologists and meteorologists. She goes on to suggest that it is perhaps to our credit that we are shocked and appalled when we read of such things. I'm inclined to agree and I, for one, found the story exciting from the opening page.  <br />	2005-07-02

The novel opens on a shocking, dark and deeply tragic note with a waterman's unsettling discovery of five year old Maggie Plummer's naked body floating in the Thames.  That she has been brutally sexually molested outrages and appals the brilliant, blind magistrate, Sir John Fielding, who institutes an immediate, urgent investigation with the assistance of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Jeremy Proctor, and Jeremy's fianc&eacute;e, Clarissa Roundtree. Jeremy and Clarissa, the intrepid and stalwart Constable Patley and Maggie's uncle, the celebrated jockey Deuteronomy Plummer (who is heart-broken at his niece's death), determine that Maggie's mother, a gin-soaked doxy from Seven Dials, sold her daughter and promptly disappeared to parts unknown. Subsequent investigation reveals that Maggie's mother, thinking she was giving up her daughter to a better life through adoption to a wealthy family, had been tricked into selling her into prostitution and slavery. The plot thickens as key witnesses are murdered and the evidence begins to point to London's upper class.<br /><br />The Price of Murder is a delicious, eminently readable potpourri of styles - first person narration of the tale by Jeremy Proctor in the style of Conan Doyle's Watson; a finely crafted,immensely satisfying mystery plot reminiscent of Agatha Christie's efforts; and a darker, earthier, much more candid representation of Georgian England's working and criminal class that might have been penned by the likes of Anne Perry. I personally would have preferred a deeper exploration into the criminal class and a story that probed prostitution, slavery and trafficking in children as opposed to the less controversial exploration of the horse-racing class in England which the reader was given. That particular disappointment was perhaps a little more profound than it otherwise might have been had Alexander not whetted my appetite so strongly with such a cruel, hard opening to his story!<br /><br />The sub-plot of the disappearance of Clarissa's erstwhile friend, Elizabeth Hooker, effectively wove in and out of the main narrative and was used to provide a very cute, clever ending which it would be quite unfair to disclose. You'll have to read the story yourself for that! The atmosphere and ambience that many other writers of historical fiction would have chosen to provide through the use of extensive descriptive passages or exposition of surrounding historical facts and details was, in a word, absent! Nevertheless, the reader is granted a pleasing feel for the period by Proctor's first person narrative that provided period appropriate conversations, motives, characteristics and actions, for example, appropriate to the stimuli that would have driven a resident of 18th century Georgian England.<br /><br />Equal parts historical fiction, police procedural and mystery with just the tiniest dash of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" tossed in for good measure, The Price of Murder is a thoroughly enjoyable, light, fast-paced read.

The water in the reservoir behind the Ataturk dam has been poisoned with a virulent toxic green scum that is growing and spreading at a frightening pace. Turkey has no options but to shut down the flow from the reservoir which is the sole source of water for Turkey's arid neighbours, Iran and Syria, until they can solve the problem with the help of Dr Mike Zammit and his team of environmental detectives and experts from INERT, the International Emergency Response Team. But, that's just the beginning! Sherbaniuk tosses a hugely disparate set of plots and sub-plots, shenanigans and skulduggery into the blender - a power-hungry, sadistic, Islamic \\"fundamentalist\\" wannabe dictator who dreams of a country of his own; GMOs (genetically modified organisms) prepared in Russia's biological warfare research program hidden away in secret cities; a modern day Rasputin leading a brainwashed Russian cult who crucifies his victims and then proves his closeness to God by bringing the victims back to life; a hard fighting, hard drinking renegade Red Army General who dreams of completing Russian dreams for domination of Istanbul; and, terrorists hiding out in ancient underground temples. The plots are peopled by a cast numerous enough to populate the Orc army in The Return of the King.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Sherbaniuk appears to have pulled it off - realistic geo-political scenarios of unrest, dissidence, revolution and war pulled from today's headlines; a frighteningly plausible biological terrorist threat;  people, governments and military forces acting and reacting in credible ways to perceived threats, crises and opportunities; and, of course, the near super human hero needed to save civilization and pull the world back from the brink of disaster! The climax arrives and you realize with pleasure that you've just been fed a gripping, enormously satisfying dose of thriller! Sherbaniuk was able to effortlessly switch back and forth from thriller to intricately detailed explanations of the science, geography or history behind his development of the fiction without disrupting the flow of events in a story that unfolds at extreme high speeds!<br /><br />(Note to the Editor: First, 90C is not 165F nor is 55C equal to 100F. The correct figures are 194F and 131F, respectively. Secondly, there is no such a race as a 400x400 metre relay.

Silly oversights and errors on simple things like this are prone to undermine the credibility of the much more detailed scientific expositions that were necessary in this novel. Look a little more sharp on the next entry, please!)<br /><br />Sadly, the fast pace of the book left little room for such things as descriptive passages and character development but, at least, Zammit and his core team members appear to have been granted the first inklings of personalities. Despite Sherbaniuk's having received mentoring from Clive Cussler, I'm pleased to say that I find Michael Zammit a much more likeable, human character than Cussler's brainchild, Dirk Pitt. Zammit is more down to earth, quite a bit more humble and is actually aware that he's mortal. The exciting promise of more to come is certainly in the air. Cairo Jackson, I'm sure, will return as Zammit's sidekick. Francis Richards, one of INERT's crackerjack environmental detectives, has been given enormous potential for future development as her feelings for Mike begin to surface despite the fact that she is uncertain whether her husband is alive or dead.

Queen Victoria almost certainly would have been amused if she had thought to pick up a copy of Edwin Abbott's inventive story \\"Flatland\\" when it was first published in 1884. But it's unlikely that she would be amused at the degree to which Pickover has chosen to rehash all of the same ideas - and, not just once, but seeking to dress the same material up as different chapters over and over again. My goodness, there are only so many ways that one can say a three dimensional sphere projects as a circle in two dimensions. Therefore, a four dimensional hypershpere projects into three dimensions as a sphere. OK, OK - I got it the first time!<br /><br />It's bad enough that Surfing Through Hyperspace barely rises above plagiarism. But Pickover has tried to tart the presentation up with a bizarre, pretentious narration that is also a simple rip off from Scully and Mulder of X-Files fame! This silly repetitious presentation borders on insulting to any intelligent reader who, after reading a couple or three chapters, will realize they would have been better off going to the store to buy the original item - Flatland.<br /><br />Any other material that is beyond Flatland - wormholes, Many Worlds Theory, quantum mechanics and superluminal contact, to name a few examples - are explained more completely and more clearly in any number of other sources. I did briefly get excited when one chapter headed down a road that looked really promising - multidimensional variations on games like chess and monopoly; knights that weren't allowed to effectively jump into the 3rd dimension by leaping over men on the board; 3-D chess play inside an 8x8 cube; a chess board on a M&ouml;bius strip. Then Pickover pulled the ultimate cop out - \\"We leave exploration of these interesting variations as an exercise to the reader.\\" For crying out loud, if I was a mathematician, a physicist or a game theorist, somehow I doubt I would have purchased the book in the first place!<br /><br />Surfing Through Hyperspace promised a deeper understanding of higher dimensions but, for me, it was a profound disappointment.erspace promised a deeper understanding of higher dimensions but, for me, it was a profound disappointment. <br />	2005-06-16
US	30340804	R21I1Q30L17JA4	0812972120	53340599	The Mysterious Island (Modern Library Classics)	Books	4	19	23	N	N	An exciting 19th century heroic adventure!	Five intrepid souls - typical Victorian \\"men's men\\" all - imprisoned in Richmond by the North's siege of the city during the American Civil War, band together in a daring escape attempt - the theft of a hot air balloon grounded by a horrific summer storm. The five men - Cyrus Harding, an abolitionist and distinguished captain in Grant's army with Neb, his negro manservant; Gideon Spilett, dauntless war correspondent for the New York Herald; Pencroft, a dashing businessman from the North and former sailor trapped in Richmond by the siege; and his young friend, Herbert Brown - plus Harding's loving dog, Top, are lofted high into the sky by the powerful storm, blown thousand of miles from Richmond and brutally dashed onto the shores of an uncharted island somewhere deep in the southern hemisphere.<br /><br />The tale unfolds as a straightforward dramatic adventure outlining the trials and tribulations of our five heroes. We are witness to their amazing transformation from prisoners, to castaways, to explorers, to pioneers and, finally, through a combination of intrepid daring, perseverance, cunning, ingenuity, derring-do, and eclectic scientific know-how, to comfortable, established colonists and citizens of their tropical paradise. Quite aptly, they've christened it \\"Lincoln Island\\". That Verne allowed himself the luxury of creating characters that were the very model of goodwill and cooperation can be overlooked. That Cyrus Harding, as an engineer, and Herbert Brown, as a young naturalist, had collective instant recall of virtually the world's accumulated scientific knowledge and a great deal of arcana besides was pushing the limits even for a story like this. But, what the heck - The Mysterious Island was intended as a \\"feel good\\" adventure, after all.  My suggestion to help the reader get past this credibility factor problem is to allow Verne's tale to stand-in as a representative microcosm of the perils facing any group of courageous immigrants colonizing a strange land starting with nothing more than the clothes on their back and their wits. I'm sure you'll set the book down feeling no less than awestruck at the achievements that a successful flourishing colony represents.<br /><br />As a historical aside, it was with no small amount of horror and disgust that I realized that Spilett's and Pencroft's complete and utter disdain and lack of consideration for the ecology of their island was probably entirely representative of Europe's attitude to these issues in the late 19th century. For example:<br /><br />\\" ... Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an animal which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack them, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound. As soon as he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which Pencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war against the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.\\" And \\"If the island is inhabited by wild beasts, we must think how to fight with and determine how to exterminate them. A time may come when this will be our first duty.\\"<br /><br />Ironically, despite their crystal clear certainty about their ability to exterminate a species under a planned program of attack, they were completely blind about the potential inability of another species to last forever as a food resource. To wit:<br /><br />\\" ... commonly known by the name of American Rabbits. This product of the chase was brought back to Granite House and figured at the evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not at all to be despised, for they were delicious. It was a valuable resource of the colony and it appeared to be inexhaustible.\\"<br /><br />That said, the book was clearly a child of its times and, as such, the attitudes which we have hopefully left behind us can now be overlooked and accepted as historical artifacts. As an adventure story, it succeeds well and Ray Harryhausen chose well to build an exciting adventure film around it. The Mysterious Island unquestionably deserves a place on your reading list.venture film around it. The Mysterious Island unquestionably deserves a place on your reading list. <br />	2005-06-13

A fixated killer, known only as \\"Digger\\", walks into Washington DC's Metro Station at 9:00 a.m. and empties a silenced Uzi on full automatic into the crowd on a brutal killing spree. The FBI receives a ransom note demanding a $20 million dollar payoff with curt instructions that unless the payment happens without a hitch, the \\"Digger\\" will repeat the mass murder at 4:00 p.m., at 8:00 p.m. and again at 12:00 midnight during the height of the New Year's Eve celebrations. Parker Kincaid, a former FBI agent and top flight forensic document examiner, is asked to return to active duty as a consultant to assist Margaret Lukas, special agent in charge of the task force put together to round up the mastermind and his automaton killer before the carnage is repeated. Given the intensely compressed time frames and enormous potential for death involved, Gerald Kennedy, DC's mayor, agrees to the payment demand and the FBI puts a plan in place to track the murderer and his \\"control\\" after the ransom is collected. The whole affair comes off the rails when the extortionist is killed in a hit-and-run car accident on the way to the drop. It now appears nobody knows how to contact \\"Digger\\" to stop the next three scheduled killing fairs!<br /><br />The reading is intense and compelling. The excitement builds from the very first page until a breathless climax with two incredible twists that will leave every reader sitting on the edge of their chairs.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the entire book takes place in less than a one day time frame, the action in this thriller is surprisingly low key and evenly paced. Deaver's success with this novel rests more on the psychological components of the drama  - examination of the realistic issue of whether a city should succumb to payment of extortion demands to terrorists and criminals; the fascinating minutiae of forensic investigation of evidence, in particular, the ransom note; the validity of profiling on the basis of criminal conduct and physical evidence such as handwriting; the political maneuvering of governments and the balance of rivalry and cooperation between police agencies during a crisis; and, both the synergy and conflict of multiple brains at work in the environment of a task force assigned to a criminal investigation.<br /><br />But the climax does arrive, of course, and,when it does, the action switches gears and becomes intense and frenetic. Despite a double surprise ending that has somewhat of a Hollywood over the top flair to it that stretches the credibility factor somewhat, any thriller fan will be left feeling they've got their money's worth! An enjoyable read, a worthy addition to Deaver's extraordinary body of work, and an easy book to recommend to those that enjoy the thriller genre.asis of criminal conduct and physical evidence such as handwriting; the political maneuvering of governments and the balance of rivalry and cooperation between police agencies during a crisis; and, both the synergy and conflict of multiple brains at work in the environment of a task force assigned to a criminal investigation. <br /> <br />But the climax does arrive, of course, and,when it does, the action switches gears and becomes intense and frenetic.

A great opening story - Kiy's wandering into the forest and his search for the bear cub that his uncle had promised him was sheer poetry! Who among us cannot remember the astonishment and wonder of a similar adventure wandering into the forest? Do you remember the terrifying frisson that occurred when you realized that you were uncertain of your surroundings or the way home? Or, as a parent, which of us has not let our attention lapse briefly and experienced that moment of terror when we look around and realize that our child has wandered away from us and we have no idea where they are?<br /><br />Rutherfurd works his tidbits of history, geography and anthropology into the story absolutely seamlessly. I love it when a well researched historical novel has something to teach me without becoming pedantic or boring. One description that just blew me away was the abrupt termination of the forest that opened up almost immediately into the vast open grassland of the steppes. I had no idea that the boundary between the two regions was so stark and precise. The second was the simple explanation of the name of the Don River - \\"Don\\" being the Iranian word for \\"water\\". I guess that one rather leaped out at me because we have a Don River just down the road from me in Toronto.<br /><br />Having acknowledged a very favourable reaction to the opening story, I confess I was unable to persist in the reading beyond the second story (and not for lack of trying - this was my second attempt at Russka). I couldn't say what it is about this novel or Russian history itself but I simply found it heavy, heavy going. On balance, (for me at least) the real history and geography was more interesting than the fictional tale that Rutherfurd was trying to weave together to present it. That would put me batting about .500 for Rutherfurd - really enjoyed Sarum, London was OK, Forest was a little better than average, haven't read Princes of Ireland and, sadly, couldn't finish Russka.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I haven't written it off at this point - I expect I need to give it another try in a different mind set!Suffice it to say, I haven't written it off at this point - I expect I need to give it another try in a different mind set! <br />	2005-06-06

Nina Voss is dying and her husband, wealthy financier Victor Voss, will do almost anything to ensure that she receives a heart transplant actually scheduled for Joshua O'Day, a young seventeen year old lad currently on top of the transplant list. In a joint act of compassion, Abby DiMatteo, second year resident and Vivian Chao, chief surgical resident of Bayside General Hospital, jeopardize their careers by obtaining a directed transplant consent to ensure Joshua gets the heart. This end run around the outraged Voss and his bottomless supply of money, the power of the hospital's transplant team and the corporate plans of Bayside's CEO, prompts a brutally swift and relentless legal vendetta from Voss intended to destroy DiMatteo's life and her medical career as a promising surgeon. In the midst of this furor, a second available heart surfaces out of nowhere and the transplant for Voss is completed. But, in the course of investigating the cause of a post-operative infection, DiMatteo discovers that records have been falsified and the source of this second heart is a terrifying and brutal black market in transplant organs.<br /><br />Gerritsen's experience as a doctor is evident in her vivid and moving portrayal of the high pressure boiler-room atmosphere in the surgical intensive care unit at a large city hospital - the unforgiving and demanding long hours; the crushing academic standards of surgical rounds and the intense competition to succeed among the resident staff; the compassionate involvement, caring and humanity that must often be held in check in order to perform as a competent professional; the resounding chaos of a crash \\"code blue\\"; and, the gut wrenching, soul-destroying fear of malpractice suits filed at the least provocation.<br /><br />Perennially present issues such as assisted suicide and conflict between certain religious belief systems and the medical profession make effective brief cameo appearances. I believe that Gerritsen did not intend that these sidebars be considered sub-plots, because they took no part in the continuity of the main story line at all. But they certainly enhanced the overall reality of the milieu and served to flesh out details of the pathos, the frustration and the extreme complexity of the environment in which the medical profession is forced to operate today.<br /><br />In her debut outing, Gerritsen has produced a medical thriller that rivals anything produced by her colleagues.

We all know that most reviews begin with a brief synopsis of the basis of the plot and, of course, attempt to avoid completely spilling the beans for potential readers that are supposed to react to the review somehow. For the sake of convention, I'll play the game - sigh!<br /><br />The Redemption of Althalus begins by introducing the hero - a very lucky, sarcastic, acerbic, witty and quite hilarious joke telling ne'er do well who's an accomplished thief and highwayman that will stoop to the odd murder or two, if it's necessary. Naturally, he survives by his wits and does as little work as is humanly possible to produce his daily bread. Does this sound to you like a chilling evil protagonist in need of lifelong redemption that can only be achieved through the direct intervention of God and his sister, Dweia, the fertility goddess? Naah - I didn't think so either!<br /><br />In an extraordinarily weak, almost cartoonish imitation of The Fellowship of the Ring, a group of good guys is rounded up to do battle with Daeva, God's evil brother who is trying to undo all of God's good stuff by changing the past. This ragtag little band, led by Althalus and Dweia, includes Andine, a spoiled little princess with a shriek that will break glass and annoy anybody; Bheid, a pious astrologer-priest; Gher, an apprentice thief who would love to follow in his mentor's footsteps (so much for redemption!); Eliar, a young mercenary warrior who slaughters Andine's father in a battle and then promptly begins to follow his hormones into love with her; and, finally, Leitha, a \\"witch\\" who can read minds.<br /><br />Other than actually saying this novel contains many of the standard elements of a fantasy - battles, characters, good, bad, magic, quest, and so on - there is little that can be said to rescue this novel from use as a doorstopper.

Victor Narraway, director of Her Majesty's Special Services Branch, under direction from the very top, briefs Pitt on a murder at luxurious Eden Lodge - the dead man, Edwin Lovat, is a junior diplomat, of no particular distinction, and, under normal circumstances of no particular importance to Special Services. The stink of potential political scandal blew all the way into Prime Minister Gladstone's office because Lovat was shot in the garden of Ayesha Zakhari, the sultry and exotic, beautiful Egyptian mistress of Saville Ryerson, a senior cabinet minister. Ryerson is currently conducting a sensitive negotiation on the price of Egyptian cotton that has enormous implications for fragile trade relationships between England and Egypt, not to mention a delicate labour situation in Manchester district that could explode into widespread strikes with disastrous economic fall-out. The difficulties are rather compounded by Ryerson's admission that he was helping Zakhari dispose of the body but neither of them is able or willing to provide any reasonable explanations beyond insisting they are innocent of the actual shooting.<br /><br />When Narraway sends Pitt hustling off to Alexandria to investigate Lovat's and Zakhari's pasts in more detail, Charlotte and their servant, Gracie, with the elegant assistance of Aunt Vespasia Cumming-Gould, look into a family matter on their own - the rather puzzling abrupt disappearance of a friend's brother. Perry's masterful and surprising resolution of these two separate investigations into a single case culminates in an explosive courtroom drama - the outcome of which may well determine the economic fate of much of the British Commonwealth.<br /><br />As usual, Perry's delicious plotlines and superb story-telling are accompanied by a voluptuous description of Victorian life that would have made Dickens or Conan Doyle look to their laurels to see who was catching up - clothing, weather, ambience, smells, sights, manners, class attitudes and distinctions, accents - it's all there in an extraordinary wealth of minute detail!

The story opens in a distant future on earth - so distant, in fact, that space travel is only a memory of the past. After countless attempts, man has begrudgingly acknowledged itself defeated by the insurmountable difficulties of travel to the stars. But, in the attempt, mankind has rediscovered and refined a long-lost talent - paranormal kinetics, a form of telepathy by which gifted individuals - called \\"parries\\" -  can \\"travel\\" to the stars and experience with their minds all that other worlds have to offer. Fishhook, a corporation set up to develop, market, sell and profit from the myriad wonders the telepathic travelers find has succumbed to the greed of a monopoly. It now secretly works at promoting a global belief that these abilities are somehow abnormal, twisted or, even worse, represent a perverted, evil magic as opposed to a normal but seldom used human talent.<br /><br />During an otherwise routine exploration, one of the parries, Shepherd Blaine, inadvertently \\"trades minds\\" with an alien intelligence. In more modern sci-fi terms, I was put in mind of a permanent Vulcan mind meld. Coming to the realization that he now has access to virtually all of the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of the galaxy, that he can simply will himself bodily through space and time, and that he is no longer even entirely human, Blaine flees Fishhook. He attempts to reconcile himself and his newly discovered abilities and knowledge with the visceral hatred and fear he encounters in the heartland of Simak's stomping grounds, the US Midwest.<br /><br />In one chapter, the irony in Simak's chilling portrayal of a frightened and hateful lynch mob trying to pull Blaine out of a local jail to string him up is extraordinary. Simak didn't dress his mob in white hoods and robes carrying burning crosses, but there was no question in my mind of the picture he was painting. The irony arose somewhat later when Simak took an opportunity to remind his readers that the US was formed as a result of the Puritan's fleeing that same type of prejudiced, bigoted persecution and hatred. As an aside, I wouldn't think that Simak had any particular subliminal message in mind when he created Fishhook but, in this modern world, one can't help but be concerned about the perils of allowing untrammeled corporate growth to blossom into pure monopoly.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable tale from the 50s and 60s classic pulp sci-fi era and a wonderful example of Simak's fertile imaginings as to how time travel might be experienced in the future. \\"Time is the Simplest Thing\\" is pretty clearly dated and doesn't travel into today's world quite as well as some of his other works but it's a fast-paced thoroughly enjoyable read nonetheless.result of the Puritan's fleeing that same type of prejudiced, bigoted persecution and hatred.

Time and Again opens in a distant future on earth that includes androids, robots, interactive television, weather control, mentophones - an ingenious device that allows instantaneous interstellar communication, dramatically extended life spans, travel to distant star systems and a humanity that has conquered the galaxy and spread its seed far and wide. After a 20 year absence, Asher Sutton returns to earth from an expedition to 61 Cygni, a system that until now has defeated every attempt at landing and exploration. In the attempt, Sutton has miraculously survived a crash that left his ship disabled and, by all odds, should have killed him. His ship has somehow managed to return to earth apparently without the actual ability to do so and Sutton, through some extraordinary feat of bio-medical engineering, appears to have been modified into something that is considerably less than completely human. He is mentally linked to someone he refers to as \\"Johnny\\". The administration on earth wonder what all of this can possibly mean.<br /><br />On the surface, Time and Again is a thrilling story of  time travel. Sutton is carrying a book which he has not yet actually written - a summary of his philosphies that, in a not too distant future, will result in the achievement of the dreams of the Android Equality League, their right to be recognized as sentient beings and a release from their treatment as mere property. But, before the book can even be actually written, Sutton must survive assassination attempts by revisionists - humans from the future who are using time travel as the means to prevent its publication.<br /><br />Simak's personal credo that reflects his quiet midwest upbringing, his pastoral approach to the science fiction genre and his concerns about humanity and its use of technology as a means to violent conflict are never very far from the surface. Indeed, they rather shine through the writing like a beacon. But, make no mistake - Simak never falls into the trap of preaching. The clear social commentary is never intrusive and never detracts for even an instant from an exciting story line.<br /><br />In Time and Again, Simak was openly critical of humanity's impression of its own importance in the universe - \\"Not by strength did he hold his starry outposts, but by something else ... by depth of human character, by his colossal conceit, by his ferocious conviction that Man was the greatest living thing the galaxy had ever spawned. All this in spite of much evidence that he was not ... evidence that he took and evaluated and cast aside, scornful of any greatness that was not ruthless and aggressive\\".<br /><br />He also used comedy as a vehicle to make a dark statement against weapons. He jests about \\"the code\\" having been changed to require everyone under age 100 to bear arms as a way of passing comment on his feelings against the US's unique constitutional amendment regarding the \\"right\\" to bear arms. His philosophical argument against Sutton's attempted use of the Christian commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" as an exemption from the code is perhaps a little blunt but does serve to point out some of the ironies involved in, for example, a right wing Bible Belt fundamentalist Christian packin' an iron.<br /><br />Finally, his creation of the Android Equality League represents an ingenious platform from which Simak can express his concerns about the ethical issues related to the problems of advanced artificial intelligence and voice his courageous, clear condemnation of the white's treatment of black people in the 1960s US and his support of the civil rights movement.<br /><br />In Time and Again, Simak has created a story that many have suggested is his finest work.

What do you get when you cross a vintage Stephen King psychological horror tale with Thomas Harris' Hannibal and toss in a frightening, destructive weapon right out of a Tom Clancy techno-thriller? You bet - Firestorm! And this one succeeds from first to last.<br /><br />As a child, Kerry Murphy spends two years in a coma after barely surviving the inferno that killed her mother and when she awakes she discovers that she has the psychic ability to sense fires. Brad Silver, a psychic \\"controller\\" knows that these abilities are the real reason for her success working as an arson investigator with her partner and dog, Sam. He needs Murphy's help in tracking down James Trask, a rogue scientist about to pass on his Firestorm technology, remote controlled high temperature accelerated arson, to the North Korean government.<br /><br />Johansen's descriptions of Murphy's psychic forays into Trask's mind as a young man are creepy, frightening, yet truly compelling reading. Witnessing Trask as a young man and a brilliant student evolving into a psychotic serial arsonist and ruthless killer is eerie and will have you turning the pages well into the wee hours. At the same time as the story rolls towards its exciting climax and Murphy's final conflict with Trask, we are party to her falling in love with Silver and witnessing the endearing \\"adoption\\" of Carmela Ruiz and her sister, Rosa, near victims of Trask's plots. Far from detracting from the story, these heartwarming sub-plots are integral to its development and are meshed into it absolutely seamlessly.<br /><br />Two thumbs up and an unequivocal recommendation to any reader that enjoys suspense thrillers!	2005-05-19

I expect he saw them as indolent, apathetic, soft, and disinterested. He may even have perceived them as pathetic. In any event, he certainly didn't share his people's terror of the world beyond their city. Lys was much more to his liking and, indeed, may have persuaded him to stay permanently had he not hatched the plan of stealing the machine to retain the memories that the Lysians wanted to wipe out.<br /><br />As a pure hard-core science fiction entry, the tale was great - high speed mass transit using \\"sidewalks\\", faster-than-light travel, robots accepting voice and telepathic commands with built-in programming overrides and safety features, rocket ships, skyscrapers that are literally \\"sky scrapers\\", mass with properties different than the solid, liquid, gas paradigm of the day and so on. All of these speak to Clarke's vision and imagination. Some real vision on the soft sci-fi side as well - the obvious need for a reduction in birth rate to coincide with the reduction in mortality rates as health improves and longevity increases, the differing paths that evolution can take, the effect of isolationist policies, the inability of people to accept change in the face of long-standing tradition and \\"religious\\" ideas and so on.<br /><br />That's it, though. Unfortunately, I give the book overall (at least, for me) a failing grade!<br /><br />While the ideas are timeless and the book could easily have been written yesterday with only minor modifications in the science, I thought the overall plot was weak and watery - an obvious prelude to the Odyssey and Rama series. In my humble opinion, Clarke is perennially unable or unwilling to provide a real or hypothesized source to his artifacts and is equally unwilling to provide a real resolution to the questions posed by the artifacts. Where does Alvin go from here? What is he likely to encounter? Why would he choose to do what he does? There are also several plot questions that remained, for me, annoyingly unresolved - namely, where the heck did Alvin come from? Was he born - if so, how? Was he hatched - if so, how and perhaps even more important, why? Lys's belief that Rorden was somehow more trustworthy than Alvin in keeping the secret of their existence seems to me naïve at best, misplaced at worst and a feeble plot contrivance to allow the story to move forward. Who was Alaine of Lyndar and why did the story that unfolded with Alvin not happen with Alaine? If the climate of earth has evolved to the point that the hydrological cycle is so totally trashed and the oceans are non-existent, how does Clarke figure that humanity would survive that? With records as extraordinary as those to which Rorden had access, it seems impossible to conceive that Shalmirane, a weapon capable of destroying a moon whose orbit had decayed to the point it was \\"falling\\", would ever be relegated in history to a legendary battle with space invaders.<br /><br />I've always been unable to figure out why Clarke is perceived as such an icon in the field of science fiction! Some fellow readers tell me that some of these questions get answered in The City and the Stars.

Pope Joan is the amazing story of a woman born out of her time - an intelligent, ambitious survivor who uses her wits and womanly nature to live in an utterly ruthless, sexist man's world and rise to the highest pinnacle of her beliefs and her calling. Her courage, her abilities, her faith and her desire to learn and to succeed despite the obstacles placed in her path at every turning by her family and her profession are a clarion call to modern women of all faiths.<br /><br />Perhaps there were female cardinals, archbishops or bishops and their existence was exaggerated and twisted into the legend of Pope Joan. At the end of the day, whether or not there actually was a Pope Joan doesn't really matter. As you read the story, Cross will make you realize that the myth certainly could have been true. Perhaps even more important, while it is unlikely that we'll ever know for certain, any reader of Pope Joan will finish the story with the hope that it is.<br /><br />Many readers may not agree with me but I have the strongest feeling that, as long as celibacy remains a requirement for ordination in the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Joan discloses one of the obvious corollary reasons for their ongoing refusal to accept ordination of women. If a female priest succumbs to human frailty such as Joan did, she also suffers the unfortunate outcome of pregnancy as a signpost pointing to a \\"sin\\" that the whole world can see. Males with the same human shortcomings can rut like bull elephants and, unless they're caught, the world is none the wiser. Even where a male priest is caught, the world can still pretend and turn a blind eye. Just my opinion, of course, but I don't suppose for a second that the RC Church would like to get caught with its proverbial pants down by having \\"weak-willed\\" female priests demonstrate their human weakness and frailty to the whole world by getting pregnant?<br /><br />Pope Joan is an amazing novel, replete with strong characters as well as historical backgrounds and settings that fairly leap off the pages with life.

Communism has fallen and the Russian people, not convinced of the value of a western style democracy, have decided to return to the monarchy. A specially appointed commission is about to annoint a new Tsar, the most logical alternatives being the living relatives of the Romanov family executed by revolutionaries in 1917. The Russian Mafia and wealthy American business elements, including Taylor Hayes, senior partner of a major US law firm, are not about to let go of the reins of power in Russia and lose the position and wealth they've amassed. They'll do whatever is necessary to ensure that their puppet, Stefan Baklanov, is the candidate chosen by the commission to accede to the throne and have asked Miles Lord, an associate in Hayes' firm, to investigate Imperial Russian and early Communist historical records to ensure that Baklanov's claim is the best it can possibly be. When Miles' archival search begins to uncover evidence that might jeopardize the Mafia's plans for the outcome of the commission election, the proverbial thriller messy stuff hits the fan. Of course, the chase is on to eliminate Lord and make sure the evidence is destroyed!<br /><br />At one point during his seach, Miles Lord was deep in thought in the stacks of a Russian archive library, examining some recently de-classified top secret papers. When he was interrupted by Semyon Pashenko, professor of history at Moscow University, he commented \\" ... I was back in 1916 for an instant. Reading this stuff is like time travel.\\" How appropriate for Berry to put such a statement into the mouth of his hero. I completely agree - that's exactly what reading a historical thriller should be! The transition from meticulously researched background to speculation, then into fiction and full throttle thriller and back again should be completely seamless and effortless. From this viewpoint, The Romanov Prophecy succeeds reasonably well.<br /><br />But, insofar as the modern thriller part of the novel is concern, Berry's efforts are pretty weak fare. The love interest, Akilina Petrovna, a circus gymnast Lord meets during a train sequence in one of the overly frequent chase scenes, is cute, cuddly and warm.  But, what the heck, she's mandatory! Who would expect a novel like this to be without some version of a femme? Orleg and Droopy, the Russian Mafia thugs are perhaps intended to be comic in some fashion - who can forget Mr Wint and Mr Kidd from 007's \\"Diamonds are Forever\\" - but their hapless efforts to chase down Lord only get them recognition as \\"Dumb and Dumber\\". Character development in general is one-dimensional. In particular, Berry makes no attempt at all to explain why Lord and Petrovna were destined to fulfill the roles of the Raven and the Eagle in a multi-national achievement of a 100 year old prophesy babbled by Rasputin just before he died. We are left to merely wonder what happened to the Russian members of the power cartel after Thorn's ascension to the throne and Baklanov's failure in the commission's vote!<br /><br />Don't go into this one with high expectations! If you're looking for a pure escapist thriller, you won't be disappointed - the scenes with the gorillas and the Russian borzoi hounds are pure Hollywood gone right over the top. Forget trying to find anything deeper - it just isn't there! Sit back, read, enjoy and have fun - don't think too hard about it.n, Berry's efforts are pretty weak fare.

A glitch in a quantum computing experiment creates a portal between two parallel universes - the one in which we live and die and another in which Homo sapiens failed, an extinct species merely a part of the fossil record, but Neanderthals have thrived and evolved into a modern species over the last 40,000 years. This is the basic premise and grist for a compelling trilogy, \\"The Neanderthal Parallax\\". The first two entries in the series, \\"Hominids\\" and \\"Humans\\", lay the groundwork for the ultimate cross-cultural inter-species experiment in which Ponter Boddit, the Neanderthal computer scientist, and Mary Vaughan, the human geneticist, fall in love, marry and plan the birth of a hybrid daughter. The profound cultural and environmental differences between the two species and the fact that they are not even genetically compatible at a chromosomal level form the basis for the plot line of the final installment in the trilogy.<br /><br />For those that like their sci-fi hard, there are lots of exciting and even controversial examples to draw on - quantum computers capable of cracking 512 bit encryption; intelligent, sentient \\"personal\\" computers hard-wired into the human body capable of monitoring and visually recording an individual's every move for posterity into an alibi archive; cochlear implants for immediate, audible communication with any individual at any point on the globe; a gene sequencer that can pull off the analysis of a complete genome in hours and then produce designer DNA or RNA based on a geneticist's computer instructions - Sawyer's imagination certainly is not short of ideas in this department!<br /><br />Social commentary in the novel, for the most part, takes the form of Ponter puzzling over humanity's basic assumptions about a wide variety of issues. Because Ponter is naturally assumed to be absolutely ignorant of any of our beliefs, conventions or practices upon his arrival in the human world, it is quite reasonable to assume that, as an intelligent being, he would also question absolutely everything. Most of his queries, of course, would occur at a very fundamental level. While Sawyer didn't attempt to put forth any solutions, this particular approach is very effective at forcing a perceptive, cautious readers to address their own particular prejudices or thoughts on these issues - sex, sexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, love, marriage, divorce, crime, punishment, jurisprudence, the world's dependence on fossil fuels, birth rates, contraception, the Roman Catholic church's positions on priestly celibacy, female ordination and the child abuse scandal by priests, religious faith and even the fact that we believe in a supreme being at all. No issue seemed off limits. I would criticize Sawyer's approach to the extent that, while he is certainly entitled to his own personal opinion, the preaching at times got very heavy-handed and was delivered from atop a self-styled Canadian soap box.<br /><br />Until the final few chapters, one might have had trouble deciding what \\"Hybrids\\" actually was - an anthropological thought experiment, a cautionary social treatise, a hard core science fiction novel or an eco-suspense thriller, and that was great! But, sadly, the climax and the denouement failed to live up to the standard of the rest of the trilogy. An over the top Hollywood style finish that was almost silly and melodramatic left one to sigh, feeling robbed that what could have been truly great was now merely good.

Audrey Niffenegger has achieved something fascinating and, I dare say, unique with The Time Traveler's Wife! She has married a simple science-fiction idea to a heart-warming romance and the result is a warm, compelling and readable human drama that succeeds on virtually every front one might choose to address.<br /><br />The science fiction - and it's a small dose, indeed - is served soft and straight up! Henry de Tamble, a librarian by trade in Chicago, suffers from chrono-displacement disorder. Episodes of this puzzling ailment, usually triggered by moments of high stress or emotion, result in his disappearance from the present and his unceremonious re-appearance (naked, if you please) at random times and places in his own past or future life. A little mental gymnastics is needed to understand how it is possible that he first met his wife Clare Abshire when he was 28 and she was 20. But, she first met him when he was in his 40s and she was only 6 years old. Niffeneger takes care to ensure that she doesn't violate the usual science fiction prohibitions against causality paradoxes that can result from time travel and interaction with one's own past.<br /><br />The writing itself is simple but earthy, warm and believable, and very human in the way it will strike some readers with its fundamental realism. This small passage on running, for example, doesn't further the plot but is important in conveying something critically important to Henry's life and character:<br /><br />\\"I am moving stiffly; cold is unkind to joints, and I'm slowly realizing that it is pretty cold out here by the lake, probably in the low twenties. So I run a little slower than usual, warming up, reminding my poor knees and ankles that their life's work is to carry me far and fast on demand. I can feel the cold, dry air in my lungs, feel my heart serenely pounding, and as I reach North Avenue I am feeling good and I start to speed up. Running is many things to me: survival, calmness, euphoria, solitude.\\"<br /><br />Anybody who has ever attempted running will identify with those few sentences. Anybody who has ever attempted to write a sentence for somebody else's enjoyment will react with jealousy and admiration at Niffeneger's ability to convey those emotions in such a simple but lucid way.<br /><br />This novel is, first and foremost, a romance and a love story that will move even a hard-nosed macho male reader, if not to tears, then to a deep and painful lump in the throat. The love, we discover with delight as we tag along on Henry's unpredictable leaps through his own history, includes love of parents, love of wives, love of friends, love of children and love of life. But Niffenegger has not neglected to remind us life also includes servings of sadness and loss in many, many forms - drugs and alcohol; fear of failure; illness, death and grieving; and, of course, loneliness, longing and absence.<br /><br />Be sure to pick this book up! And then, as you read it, I'm sure you will put it down - several times, in fact - so you can stop and reflect on the beauty of what you have just been privileged to enjoy.<br /><br />Paul Weissas ever attempted running will identify with those few sentences.

Selective breeding and carefully planned marriages with subtle financial encouragement from a secretive group called the Howard Foundation carried out over the last 150 years have resulted in a group of humans that have the extraordinary trait of extreme longevity - Lazarus Long, the patriarch of the Family, born Woodrow Wilson Smith, carries his two hundred plus years quite well! When pressed for his true age, he's either not telling or he won't admit that he truly doesn't know himself! In 2125, a series of events result in the global administration and the remainder of earth's population discovering the Family's existence. A frenzy of enraged jealousy erupts as a maddened, frustrated world seeks to discover the secret fountain of youth they are convinced the Family is guarding for their own use. Hounded by the threat of murder, torture, brainwashing and ultimate extinction by their shorter lived neighbours, the Family flees earth on an untested starship. The discovery of two planets and alien races that pose threats and challenges even more imposing than those from which they fled plus an overwhelming loneliness for the way of life they left so far behind lead them back to earth for a second try.<br /><br />In Methuselah's Children, Heinlein has crafted an exciting novel, a message, a screenplay and the movie script all at once. Descriptive passages, while compelling and very cleverly written are sparse and infrequent and the plot is almost exclusively driven by razor-sharp dialogue. Heinlein's method of conveying the story through his characters' mouths has got wit; it's got dialect; it's got humour and intelligence; it's got sensible science; it's got humanity and it's got credibility. Their expressions and manner of speaking firmly place the origins of the story in the 1940s USA but somehow Heinlein has managed to inject enough charm to leave it timeless.<br /><br />For those like me that frequently read for the thrill, the entertainment and the pure joy of a story without looking for any subliminal message or morality tale, Methuselah's Children succeeds in spades. Hard sci-fi runs rampant through every page and fleshes out a superb story line - \\"refreshers\\" (think Star Trek's sonic showers), private space yachts, hydroponics used for mass food production, psychometrics (no doubt, first cousin to Asimov's famous \\"psycho-history\\"), extreme enhancement of longevity through selective breeding, elimination of national boundaries and the implementation of a global administration, inter-stellar travel at relativistic speeds, super-luminal warp travel \\"in the dark\\" reached with instantaneous acceleration, cryogenics and suspended animation for long-term space faring, lunar and Venerean colonies, orbital construction of spaceships, blasters, aliens, communication in an alien language, telepathy, high speed bio-engineering, and lots more. Although Heinlein didn't use the word \\"replicator\\", he may well have been sitting on the script team for a Star Trek episode when he had Lazarus order up a customized kilt:<br /><br />\\"He sat down in a sales booth and dialed the code for kilts. He let cloth designs flicker past in the screen while he ignored the persuasive voice of the catalogue until a pattern showed up which was distinctly unmilitary and not blue, whereupon he stopped the display and punched an order for his size. Ten minutes later he stuffed the proctor's kilt into the refuse hopper of the sales booth and left, nattily and loudly attired.\\"<br /><br />For those that wish to dig a little more deeply - don't despair - Heinlein has got much to say that will keep many a party conversation going on a variety of topics: the psychology and, oftentimes, fear of aging and death; mob psychology; prejudice and the abnormal fear of something that is different than we are; the importance of work, activity and a feeling of contributing as a part of the human condition.<br /><br />This book was more than exciting - it was fun and entertaining in the bargain!<br /><br />Paul Weiss	2005-04-29

As the paranoia and fear of the early stages of the Cold War escalated and the prospect of global destruction in an atomic war crystallized into a terrifying possibility, a pioneering trip to a more placid Mars must have seemed welcoming. As early successes with the development of technology such as \\"Sputnik\\" made a an exploration of this magnitude a likely technological achievement within the next few decades, manned exploration and the colonization of Mars no doubt evolved into a sexy and exciting dream, indeed.<br /><br />Bradbury's series of loosely connected vignettes set against the backdrop of America's first landing on Mars, the false starts and failures of several expeditions and the spread of disease resulting in the elimination of a planet's entire population, actually constitute a scathing critique of what he saw as the worst failings of the social fabric of 1950s America - imperialism, bigotry and racial prejudice, xenophobia, guns, environmental pollution, waste, foreign policy, censorship, and the untrammeled growth of technology all wrapped up in the unfailing smug sense of superiority that the American way is the only way!<br /><br />\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is not a straightforward read. In the opening chapters, a light and fluffy approach borders on inane as the reader is left wondering precisely what is happening. It's only perseverance that will lead the reader to a more profound understanding and appreciation of Bradbury's intention. \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\", for instance, is perhaps the most moving single piece of writing I have ever experienced - extraordinary in its simplicity and yet blistering in its condemnation of the treatment of blacks in the American south in the 50s. Finally, the reader will be rewarded with the warm, optimistic closing of \\"The Million Year Picnic\\". This is perhaps the only story in the entire collection in which I believe Bradbury really is talking about the future and the possible colonization of another planet. It is his simple suggestion that these efforts would be doomed to an extended and painful failure if Americans attempt to shape another planet into the mould of their US-centric terrestrial expectations. Only through adaptation and the re-formulation of society according to what the planet will allow, would such colonization be expected to prosper.<br /><br />Everyone who reads to the end of this story will wonder whether it should be considered as science fiction at all but nobody will harbour the smallest doubt that the term \\"Classic\\" is richly deserved.<br /><br />Paul Weisssimple suggestion that these efforts would be doomed to an extended and painful failure if Americans attempt to shape another planet into the mould of their US-centric terrestrial expectations.

A biographical novel re-creating the entire forty-five year life of a monarch such as Mary Queen of Scots embellished and fleshed out with fictional anecdotes and details to bring an enormous cast of characters to life cannot help but be long in the telling. Any lover of books knows that long need not of necessity be tedious but even George's first-rate story telling abilities could not rescue this novel from the gray, incessant boredom fostered by the astounding futility of Mary's birth, life, actions, decisions and even her death. During her imprisonment and separation from Bothwell, Mary summarized her own life very succinctly in a few desperate sentences:<br /><br />\\"I have nothing, she thought. I have been Queen for four and twenty years, but if I died in my sleep this very night, there would be nothing to write of me in the chronicles. I was Queen of France for a year and a half, but when Francois died, all that passed away, and today France remembers me not. I have reigned directly here in Scotland for six years now, and although there has been no foreign war, the nobles never made peace amongst themselves. My whole reign has been a series of plots, followed by my pardons. My marriages have all failed in one way or another. I have not succeeded in being recognized by Elizabeth as her successor. The Catholics abroad have turned against me because I was not severe enough with the heretics in Scotland, the heretics in Scotland hate me because I am a Catholic at all. I have failed.\\"<br /><br />If one of the reasons for historical knowledge is awareness of past errors so our descendants might learn to avoid the same mistakes, then, at least for me, Margaret George succeeded by penning a book that is a scathing condemnation of the hypocrisies and astonishing arrogance of any individual or family believing that they are anointed of God to be a ruling family. I believe it is hardly an over-statement to suggest that hereditary monarchy as an institution is illustrated by George as inherently flawed, at best, and evil, at worst. In either case, it has no place in a twenty-first century modern society.<br /><br />Similarly, George pulls no punches in pointing out the lack of tolerance of one established religion for all others. While we have made strides in allowing for the co-existence of multiple religions in a modern world, this 16th century novel gives us a chilling reminder that we still have a great distance to travel. To her credit, I would find it impossible as a result of her writing to guess what faith George herself might profess.<br /><br />Hardly a thrilling page turner but a book well worth the effort to read!herently flawed, at best, and evil, at worst.

Fantastic, frightening and entirely plausible, \\"Day of the Triffids\\" is a post-apocalyptic story based on a simple hypothesis - mass blindness coupled with the natural disaster of a mobile stinging plant called the triffid created by genetic engineering gone sour! Wyndham's genius is how he uses the tale of his still sighted protagonists, Bill Masen and Josella Playton, to address the moral and psychological issues that would be certain to raise their heads in this particular new world order - the definition of marriage, sexuality and the survival of the race, law and order, male vs female roles, government and authority, survival of the fittest and many more. Thought provoking in the extreme and yet still completely satisfying even when read only on the surface as a science-fiction thriller!<br /><br />Paul Weiss	2005-04-29

Two hundred years ago, Cassilin, king of fire and son of the great Magravandian house of Malagash conquered Caradore and its guardian family, the Palindrakes. He took their land and crippled their heritage by demanding an oath of perpetual fealty from Valraven, the young heir to the throne. Valraven's mother bid him accept this humiliation willingly such that their association with the power of the Sea Dragons could be hidden until the time was right for its revival to aid them in reclaiming their land and their freedom.<br /><br />Many generations have passed. Valraven, the current eldest son of the Caradorean family, accepts posting to the Magravandian military, part of his ancestor's oath, but his twin sister Pharinet struggles with the realization that the time is coming to reawaken the magic of their country's connection to the sea and the Sea Dragons.<br /><br />What a shame! That Storm Constantine can write is beyond dispute. Her descriptive passages are moving and brilliant. Her dialogue is lucid, realistic and fast-paced. The magic or dream sequences are eerie, fascinating and compelling. But, in spite of all that, this novel is as fundamentally flawed as its characters. One and all, they are driven by emotions and traits that are either dark and ugly or weak and pathetic - greed, lust, ambition, hunger for power, ambivalence, amorality or moral turpitude, egocentricity, sycophancy and selfishness. Pharinet, for example, comes to realize that her incestuous love for her twin, Valraven, cannot be continued but at no time expresses even the slightest apology or twinge of regret. Even when these characters appear to display strength or courage or unity of purpose, it is not noble and seems to arise only out of their dark side.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, develops slowly but it is masked by deep, impenetrable, swirling layers of foggy mysticism, magic and fantastical writing that make the story line all but inscrutable. At no time does the story aspire to anything uplifting. Unrelenting darkness with no interludes of pleasure or lightness makes this novel depressingly difficult to continue. If this is Gothic fantasy, then I'll give the genre a pass. I'm certainly not inspired to continue with the trilogy or seek out anything else by the same author. I repeat - what a shame!<br /><br />Paul Weissnrelenting darkness with no interludes of pleasure or lightness makes this novel depressingly difficult to continue.

He also seems openly critical of a priesthood that has misinterpreted its role in society and as a result has misappropriated and abused the power that history accorded it. Religious and racial intolerance also make cameo appearances.<br /><br />But, all the while, Keyes never forgets that he is telling a story - and, it's one you won't be forgetting for a long time to come!<br /><br />Paul Weiss	2005-03-18
