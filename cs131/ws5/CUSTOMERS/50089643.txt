Superb science fiction book, but with a bit of a difference - there was a lot more social interaction than in your average hard core SF novel. Not character interaction, but the interaction of the different philosophies. It made the book.<br />This book has the same sort of Robinson twist. On the face of it, it is a book dealing with the premise that the Black Death had been a bit more deadly, wiping out Europeans and leaving the world to the Chinese, the Indians and the Arabs, and a few other odds and sods.<br />Robinson's twist is that the major characters keep on returning every hundred years or so, being reincarnated higher or lower according to their previous lives. This gives a sense of continuity to the grand thousand year epic from Middle Ages to modern times.<br />Some might find a little more philosophy than they like, but those who enjoyed his Mars books will probably like this one too, as there is about the same amount. It also gives the thoughtful reader something to chew on while progressing through the otherwise straightforward tale.<br />I enjoyed it, and kept reading to find out what would happen next incarnation. A bit of a quirky classic.	2004-02-24

In fact you could say it's Piece of Cake transferred to Bomber Command without the freshness or style that made the previous book so good.<br />But it kept my interest for the day and a half it took me to read it.<br />To begin with, we learn a fair bit about medium bomber operations in early World War Two, before the bomber offensive really got cranked up. Just as in Piece of Cake, they were doing it all wrong at the beginning yet thought they were hot stuff and it takes a while to puzzle out their mistakes.<br />The arrival of a film crew and their participation on a mission over Germany gives a unique insight into the difficulties of undertaking such a mission at all, let alone filming it. I enjoyed that part.<br />But on the down side, when two of the wilder pilots went off for a drunken spree in London, I thought oh-oh - I've been here before. There's a bit of a feud and a bit of tension amongst the characters, but it hardly comes close to what we enjoyed in Piece of Cake. The marriage of two of the characters and subsequent events is just bizarre.<br />On the plus side, it didn't descend into the slapstick of A Good Clean Fight.<br />All in all, it covers a lot of familiar territory, it doesn't have the &quot;edge&quot; of previous novels, but it's inoffensive and entertaining. I like Robinson's style and that made this a four star book rather than a more mediocre three.	2004-02-08

In his foreword, Jerry Pournelle pays homage to the late great Robert Heinlein and the &quot;juvenile&quot; science fiction books that hooked so many into the genre. I certainly remember them with fond affection before Heinlein turned his talent along other paths, and re-read them to this day.<br />Starswarm is indeed a book very much in the style of those books, complete with the adolescent protagonist, his loyal friends, adults of superior intelligence, ethics and ability, and of course a swag of strange creatures and a talking computer.<br />There are echoes of &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; here, as well as from any number of other Heinlein juveniles, but the plot is Pournelle's own, underscored with more computer knowledge than Heinlein ever had, and it is as compulsive a read as any of Pournelle's other books.<br />I enjoyed it immensely, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes these &quot;coming of age in the space age&quot; novels.	2004-02-06

The earth was soiled and black with grease and filth and the very air was heavy with foulness.<br />This is not a book for the faint-hearted, but it is a superbly well-researched account, drawn from eyewiteness statements and official documents of what happened when nearly 10 000 dead and two or three times that many wounded were left in a quiet farming community by armies that had gone elsewhere.<br />This is essential reading for anybody wishing to know the whole story of Gettysburg. It has many maps and illustrations and photographs not seen elsewhere, and a comprehensive set of notes.	2004-01-27

Rather unfortunate timing as Hewson retired soon after and disappeared off the radar screen of public life.<br />Rather like Christine's next champion, Paul Keating, who defeated Hewson, but was savagely booted out in 1996 by the voters, who hadn't expected him to beat Hewson and extracted their revenge.<br />Kim Beazley had two goes at the top job, but was defeated each time, despite Christine's solid help the second time around.<br />She seems to be able to administer the kiss of death in a charming and well-researched manner.	2003-12-30

It's fun and it's educational, as well as being a great read.<br />Highly recommended in its own right, but mandatory for anyone who is a fan of the later books.

Max has had himself a great deal of fun in writing this and it just flows out of the page and into the reader. It's our world, but with the colour and commercialisation turned up - over the top but a logical extension of what we have now.<br />It's full of clever lines and outrageous concepts, such as when Hack Nike goes to the police to complain about a contract murder and they, well, you'll have to read it for yourself.<br />I got this book as a BookCrossing \\"Pay It Forward\\" act of kindness and it made my day. [Heck], it made my whole week, though I finished it quick smart and my wife promptly grabbed it to see for herself what I'd been chortling over and has been buried between the covers ever since, only emerging to chortle over some fresh line.<br />This book has spawned a multiplayer online game run by the author, something entirely appropriate to the book's concept.<br />Oh yeah.

Not in any sort of slapstick or sitcom terms - it is the way the story is written and the way the characters interact with each other. Nell literally pours sunlight into the fossilised office of an old private investigation agency, breaking all the rules.<br />Second. This story is fairly complex. The characters are all linked to each other, and it might help if you make your own scorecard to work out who is or was married to whom and who their relatives are. Then there's a murder story bound in which adds to the twists.<br />And don't forget the dog. It's also a mutliple love story and extremely sexy in parts.<br />There. I think I've covered the highlights. The characters are well-drawn and it's going to be a long time before I forget the epic relationship between Nell and Gabe. The plot, as I've said, is complex and multi-layered, but it moves smartly along.<br />And this book has inspired me to read more by Jennifer Crusie.<br />Highly recommended for those wanting a romance story with guts and good humour.	2003-02-24

Rome had always been a very tedious place, full of dry-as-dust old people, all with odd names, and all more or less running into each other. Cicero and Caesar, Cato and Pompey, Brutus and Cassius, all just names to me.<br />Colleen McCullough brought them all alive again, made Rome into a living, breathing, bustling, smelly city, where real people lived, had real concerns, real conflicts and real desires. I couldn't get enough and as each year brought another big thick square volume in the series I brought myself up to date and found the story engrossing, utterly engrossing. The first books merely cleared the way for Caesar, laying the foundations for him, introducing the people and places that would shape his character, but soon enough he was there - a baby, a boy, a young man, a leader, a general, a politician.<br />It has been a wonderful journey, but the final years remained untold. I watched as Colleen wrote other books on other subjects and I worried that the grand series might remain forever unfinished.<br />But, O! the joy last week when I saw The October Horse, fresh and new and just begging to be picked up. I snatched it up and hugged it with glee.<br />It has been well worth the wait. We join Caesar in Alexandria, where he conquers Cleopatra, and it is a fascinating tale of politics, strategy, war, and love. Colourful doesn't begin to describe this episode. It is Julius Caesar at the height of his powers and making the most of it in a romantic setting.<br />Forget Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. This is the real deal, and the first meeting of the two is nothing like the movie.<br />Caesar is all too soon gone, to quell revolts, to settle Rome, and to crush the final Republicans. McCullough's Mark Antony is nothing like Shakespeare's, and the conspirators are torn in their motivations and ambitions.<br />All too soon the tragic end is upon us and the story closes.<br />And you know what? I can't wait to start again and read the whole saga through, one after the other, this time without those intervening gaps of years.	2002-11-28

But after a day, I was hooked! No way was I going to ration myself to ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the afternoon!<br />I went back and checked out the book, and a day later it was all gone.<br />The book hooks you right from the start with a dramatic opening episode. I was on the edge of my car seat and sat in the garage for a few minutes after I'd arrived back home to hear how it turned out.<br />The book builds up to a complex and tense situation, where characters are balanced off against each other. The climax is satisfying, dramatic, and nicely resolved.<br />And in between opening and resolution, you learn about modern (and ancient) Montana, wolves, bureaucracy and small-town community life. I think the point is neatly made that, just as wolves are part of a web of life, so too are humans and there are all sorts of groups and niches, all struggling against each other - and sometimes co-operating.<br />I think we've all met someone like the big, brash, bright, bold, bullying Buck Calder. He strides through the novel and turns up where the other main character Helen Ross least expects him. Helen is everything Buck isn't. City-bred, female, sensitive, and devoted to keeping wolves alive in the wild. Buck isn't. As a rancher, he wants them all dead.<br />In between is Luke, Buck's son, torn by conflicting loyalties and emotions. Poor Luke!<br />You'll have to read the book to find out what happens to Luke, but it's pretty dramatic - that's all I'll say.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely. The setting, the characters and the plot are colourful, realistic and interesting. The title, like his other books, is a play on words, and there is an undercurrent of philosophy running through it, just enough to make you think.<br />I'll be reading his other books shortly. And I won't bother with the audiobook versions - I'll be wanting something I can taketo bed and cuddle up with for hours at a time!	2002-11-10

There aren't the depths upon depths of O'Brian in style, nor the superb characterisation of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin.<br />But the setting is the same, with a bonus of more realism than O'Brian ever managed, and the language of the lower deck is just as pungent.<br />It's much the same world, this time seen from before the mast, and this is the half-world that O'Brian rarely peeped into. We live in the shadows of the gun decks, our existence made up of rows and rows of hammocks, the mess tables between the guns, the fo'csle make and mend and the taunt line to be toed when dealing with officers.<br />The atmosphere is pungent - and you can almost smell the rich aromas that arise during the action. The sights and sounds of the lower deck complete the picture.<br />If I have a criticism, it's that some of the events and characters are a little far-fetched. A few too many coincidences for my liking, and one is made conscious of the mind of the author doing a little embroidery here and there.<br />But, that niggle aside, this is a series I shall follow with keen interest. Maybe Stockwin cannot match the literary style of O'Brian, but he gives us a new view on the same world and it is a pleasure to revisit it.<br />Oh yeah. Keep a bucket handy for when the barky starts to toss. You'll find yourself at the end of the book afore ye know it and be rolling down the street to buy the next in the series.	2002-11-05

Stephen Ambrose based his account on personal interviews and diaries and letters written at the time, occasionally moving back to a larger view when he quotes from an official history or other text.<br />This is the story of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101 Airborne Division. A famous group in a famous unit, fighting from Normandy in the early hours of D-Day, through Holland in the spectacular failure of Operation Market-Garden and Belgium in a gallant stand at Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge, all the way to Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest\\" in the Austrian mountains, where the victors had a well-deserved feast of wine, women and song.<br />This is an incredible story, told mainly in the words of those who were there, and you can feel the fear, exhilaration, killing fury, bitter cold and biting hunger along the way. But ost of all you can feel the camaraderie of soldiers thrown together in a remote training camp in 1942, who trained and fought as a band of brothers and now, sixty years on, still maintain their closest friendships with each other.<br />In another sense it is a story of an amazing soldier - Second Lieutenant Winters, one of the founding officers of Easy Company, who ended up a Major commanding the battalion. He led his troops with coolness and courage, intelligence and humanity. He gained more than respect, he gained the love of these warriors, and he earnt it through common sense decisions in training and in combat. His decisions saved the lives of his men and cost the enemy dearly, and his small unit actions are still cited as textbook examples.<br />This book is chockablock full of infantry minor actions. Advance, assault, defence, withdrawal, patrolling and raiding - all told from multiple viewpoints in stark detail - the war in microcosm as seen by airborne infantrymen.<br />There are maps andpictures, an index and an epilogue describing the postwar careers of the men of Easy. This book stands alone as totally engrossing war story, but is also an essential companion to the magnificent HBO miniseries.<br />As a brutally, touchingly honest story of men at war, I cannot recommend this book too highly. It is an instant classic.	2002-10-24

He's not fooled. You or I would get a lot of tall stories if we tagged along with a notebook, but Robert Gandt knows what's going on, and he gives us the good guff as he follows a class of \\"nuggets\\" learning how to fly, fight, strike, and carrier qualify with the F/A-18 Hornet.<br />Along the way he looks at some if the issues facing the US Navy. Race, education, sex, safety. And warfighting. This is deadly serious stuff, and these people are the cream of America's crop just to have got to the stage where they are even considered for fighter training.<br />It's a hell of a lot of fun, to live that little boy dream, but also a hell of a lot of work, and I take my hat off to the aviators Gandt describes. I also took my shoes off and put my feet up for a day while I read the book, and though the world outside was calm and sunny, inside my head the windows were rattling and the floor shaking with the roar of these high performance aircraft flying off the pages of this most excellent book.

This is a story of a man walking away from the senseless destruction and the crude killing of the Virginia battlefields.<br />This is a man with an eye on the future, and all the way through the story we learn more and more of what his aims and ambitions are. Inman doesn't shrink from killing, but neither does he want to be part of it. He just wants to walk home to Cold Mountain and if people put themselves between him and his mountain, well that's too bad.<br />Along the way we meet some truly memorable characters, thieves, priests, boors, hermits and heroes, all struggling to keep themselves alive in the final days of the Civil War, when food is scarce, winter is coming on and a shadow lies over the land.<br />The other side of the story is Ada, a Charleston lady somehow marooned in the backblocks of North Carolina with no clear idea of her future. She barely goes more than a mile or two from her hardscrabble farm, but her own journey of learning is somehow more epic than Inman's.<br />Their final meeting is satisfying, glorious and tragic. Well worth the slow journey to get there.<br />There is action enough to keep the story alive, but the spirit of this book lies in the detailed background of the environment, the people, places and things of the time. This book oozes realism.<br />Contrasting with the gritty, greasy taste of the times, we experience the dreams and memories of the characters as they think about other days, other people, other travellers, from the vanished Indians to half-mad botanists.<br />There is a blending, a melding, a weaving together of many strands in this book. Almost without dialogue, it is nothing so much as a long lyrical poem, speaking on several levels, and delving deep to link man with man, man with woman, woman with woman and all of them with the land and the creatures and plants they share it with.<br />In thesefew poor words I've barely scraped the surface of the richness of this book. Set aside a week and read it, enjoying it a few chapters per day. And then read it again to see what you've missed the first time around. It's a book worth coming back to - read it once a year for the rest of your life, and you'll still find new insights.	2002-09-16

It's good to see Tom Clancy has trimmed a lot of the fat from his novels, but there's still a way to go before we get back to the crisp, tense technothrillers that kicked off his career.<br />Like Patriot Games and Without Remorse, Red Rabbit is a step back in the sequence. Set between the events of PG and HFRO, Jack is a CIA analyst posted to London. But we don't get a lot of analysis, unless you count the \\"inside the head\\" moralising of the characters.<br />Instead there is steady and reasonably tense action as the good guys catch a fish and reel him in. When he arrives there's a new moral question posed, but Jack teams up with a few likely lads from the British side and has another brush with history.<br />Not the edge of your seat tension nor the whip-crack surprises of his earliest books, but a pleasant, fairly predictable read. Tom Clancy ties his character into the real world with the benefit of superb hindsight.<br />Jack comes across as a bit more credible in this book. He has the language of an ex-Marine of 1982, so if you don't like a bit of low level cussin', you might be a bit upset. He gets caught up in trying to explain what he's doing to his wife, and we've all been there in treading the fine line between the truth and a plausible fiction.<br />I liked seeing more of the peripheral players in the Ryan saga, particularly the Foleys.<br />Not a lot of hot technology, but let's face it, just about everything from that time - the early 80s - is old hat now. The emphasis is on espionage, and how far removed that is from the James Bond model. If you like realistic spy stories, you'll like this one.<br />I just wish Tom Clancy could cut out a bit of the repetition and trim down the sermons. I also get the feeling that a lot of this book is \\"payback\\" to various friends for showing him a good time - all the people, especially the British, are jolly good sorts and spread the fine food thick on the table.<br />Over all, it's a step in the right direction for Tom, an essential part of the Jack Ryan story, and a pleasant read to boot. But please, Tom, can we cut the next book in half and double the action?	2002-08-27

I've just finished the four \\"Lonesome Dove\\" novels, and I'm a McMurtry junkie. Love his style, love his understanding of the old West, love his realism. <br />This book, as well as being brutally honest, is also beastly funny. The large Berrybender family, travelling up the Missouri and Platte Rivers in a well-stocked steamboat, is as eccentric as they come, and we not only see the West through our modern eyes, but through the eyes of aristocratic English folk. And their servants. <br />McMurtry tells the tale with gentle humour and a marvellous gift for words, and I enjoyed every one of them. I'm looking forward to seeing more in the promised series.<br />But then, I'm biased.	2002-08-03

Great reads, full of love and violence, colourful and exciting. And educational - history comes alive in his books, virtually bursting out of the page to take you by the throat. Or the heart.<br />In Spangle he has outdone himself. This is my favourite of all his books, and perhaps the most poignant. We follow Zachary Edge, a colonel riding away from Appomattox, from his chance meeting with the down at heel circusman Florian through post Civil War America across the Atlantic to Europe, all the way to Moscow and back, ending in the beseiged Paris of the Franco-Prussian War.<br />Along the way Florian's circus grows and prospers, until he performs before the very crowned heads of Europe. Colonel Edge learns the circus trade, all its tricks and traditions, and we learn along with him. It is a road story of course, as all circus stories must be, but this one is longer than most, and travels a more colourful, exciting road than the circus itself.<br />It is a grand entertainment from start to finish, at every page revealing the fruits of Gary Jennings' research into the history of the circus.<br />And in these latter days, where the animals are mostly gone, and circuses are fewer than they were, it is a journey back to freeer, happier days.<br />One of my personal favourites, as much for the wealth of detail as for the story.	2002-06-16

This is an awesome book, a spy thriller of the old school, with moles and Joes, cutouts and dead-drops, plots and counterplots. There are the usual colourful characters - the Sorcerer in the seedy sleazy alleys of post-war Berlin is worth the price of the book alone - and thrilling if not romantic situations. It goes on for a satisfying length, a good solid read, and there are meaty plots and subplots and subsubplots to give the reader a generous fill as the story follows through the early days of the CIA and the freezing of the Cold War, past Hungary and Cuba, a long episode in Afghanistan and ultimately to the White House of Boris Yeltsin, where generations meet in a blazing conclusion.<br />There are plot twists and red herrings, tension and drama as the key players work against each other to uncover a high-level mole. I won't give the game away, but if you keep your wits about you right from the beginning, you should be able to spot the first seeds that will sprout shoots of doubt and ultimately grow to bear fruit many many years later.<br />The plotting (and I use the word advisedly) in this book is of a high level. It flows naturally, never forced, always thrusting the story along. Little details echo the moods and motivations of the characters, tieing in to one another and weaving a multi-stranded tapestry that gives the book so much of its satisfying flavour. It is hard to say what I enjoyed most, but perhaps the scenes that most impressed me were inside the Ronald Reagan White House, where the various political motivations of Washington institutions were dealt with in rambling code phrases in a sort of real-like movie shot in the mind of the President. Scary, haunting stuff.<br />But I guess I'm rambling too. Make no mistake. This novel is big, but it is no meandering time-filler. It is tightly written for all its size, and it will keep you turning just one more page until you get to the end. It is one of those rare books where you get to the end and want to start at the beginning again to read it again in a new light.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-06-08

There is also beauty, glory, triumph and tragedy in this story of Alexander the Great based on the historical record.<br />But most of all there is love, and once we get over the nature of that love, we can surrender ourselves to enjoying the flow of the story as we follow Alexander the Great, one of history's most fascinating figures, on a journey of conquest through the known world. <br />We follow him from the viewpoint of the Persian boy of the title, a narrator very different to the usual fictional protagonist. But this boy is not fictional, he really lived, and I venture to suggest that Mary Renault's tale is not half as colourful as the real thing must have been.<br />I find it hard to lay a handle on this book. It's fiction, it's history, it's a romance, a war story, an epic adventure. It deals with the great themes of humanity and it's a ripping yarn.<br />If you've read any of Mary Renault's other books, you won't need convincing. If you haven't, then enjoy this one as your first taste of her opus, because it is one of her very best.	2002-06-03

One of them concerns an episode of Nineteenth Century punishment in The Reverse of The Medal, movingly described and often read aloud by Patrick Tull, of audiobook fame.<br />But the other occurs in Desolation Island as Jack's ship, the horrible old Leopard, and the Dutch Waakhamzeid engage in an epic duel across the wastes of the Southern Ocean. For sustained conflict, ever-rising tension and a shattering, moving climax, there is nothing else like it in O'Brian's many books. It is, quite simply, superb.<br />The rest of the book is O'Brian at his best. Stephen hatches a devious plot to do with naval intelligence, Jack sails the ship and the rest of the familiar cast of characters make us feel at home aboard. For those who want to keep track, this is the book where O'Brian leaves his &quot;standalone&quot; format, and embarks on a multi-book adventure that continues through The Fortune of War and The Surgeon's Mate before Jack and Stephen are free to take their ease in England once again.<br />And, in his own inimitable style, O'Brian tells us some of the background to the War of 1812 between the USA and the UK, in which the horrible old Leopard plays a crucial part.<br />My verdict? Read it, for all love!	2002-05-25

Let's not pretend otherwise.<br />Having said that, the ancient Chinese master strips away all the familiar trappings of war - the warriors, weapons, forts and tactics - to reveal the essence of conflict and how to win.<br />His lessons are as valid here and now as they were in an empire a long time ago and far, far away. It simply does not matter how you are fighting, what you are fighting over nor even why you are fighting. If you are forced into conflict with another, the lessons in this book will guarantee victory.<br />Brute strength, overwhelming force, super weapons, holding the high ground, none of these are required for victory. All that is needed is a leader who can understand and apply the principles of warfare.<br />Essentially it boils down to three ideas.<br />1. Know yourself.<br />2. Know your enemy.<br />3. Only fight when you can win.<br />Do this, and you will win competitions, elections, games. Anything that involves conflict. Even wars.<br />Sun Tzu's elegant language lays bare the principles of warfare, illustrating his lessons with examples from Ancient China. It is a thought-provoking, colourful and valuable book.	2002-05-12

At the end of the previous novel in the series, Jack Aubrey is returning home to England and marriage to his beloved Sophie, dreaming of the rosy future.<br />Here in the opening chapters of The Mauritius Command is that future, and they are some of the most sustained humorous scenes of the entire Canon. Poor Jack - marriage isn't quite what he imagined it to be!<br />But all too soon we are away on another cruise with Stephen Maturin, this time with a temporary promotion to Commodore, and the flying of a broad pendant to mark the fact. There's glory for you!<br />The bulk of the novel concerns the more or less historical campaign to win back Mauritus from the French, and it is here that I venture a word of criticism, for Patrick O'Brian bound himself a little too tightly with the actual history and has to resort to some literary strategems to keep up with the sometimes confusing action.<br />But that's by the by and along the way we meet some fascinating new characters, revisit some happy old ones, and spend a reasonable amount of time doing the things that make a Patrick O'Brian novel so well worth reading.<br />I enjoyed this book very much, hence the five star rating, for even a Patrick O'Brian book a trifle off his usual pace is a very good book indeed.<br />It is a good self-contained adventure, very rare in this series where a journey quite often takes four books or so to come to a conclusion, and it comes with the necessary maps at the beginning and an excellent essay on Jack Aubrey's ships at the end, including extracts from the plans of the dear old Surprise.<br />An excellent read and the pleasure is enhanced by the marvellous Geoff Hunt painting on the cover.	2002-05-09

In some he succeeds, as the regiments of fans of his Sharpe series will attest. In others he has swung and missed.<br />So I approached this latest book with an open mind, not knowing whether I would race through it or put it down unfinished.<br />I am happy to say that Cornwell has made a solid hit with this story. It is steadily paced action, building tension every step of the way until the very end, and it is very hard to put down without wanting to get back to see what happens next.<br />The setting is London, post Waterloo, and at times the reader almost gags from the stink of open sewers and corruption high and low. It opens with a gruesome execution at Newgate Prison and ends with another, the tension reaching an unbearable point as the last chapter echoes the first and we feel the dread of the condemned at each step along the final walk from cell to scaffold.<br />In between, we follow a new character, Captain Sandman, as he gains allies and enemies investigating a murder mystery. I hope we see more of him, and I rather think we will, as Cornwell leaves some plot strands dangling to be picked up again in the next novel.<br />Underlying the action and tension there is a wealth of historical information and an examination of the system of crime and punishment in Georgian England. Never rammed down our throats, nor sugar-coated, but it is there, and we may think some deep thoughts along the way.<br />All in all, this latest book is tightly written, filled with action, romance and tension. Strongly evocative of the place and time, and another big tick for Bernard Cornwell.	2002-04-30

Submarines, when first used, were cramped, smelly, dangerous places - and that was when tied up alongside. When they put to sea, or were actually used in combat, things got really bad.<br />In the days before World War Two, if something went wrong with one of these notoriously complicated, fragile and ricketty craft, it was a virtual death sentence. If the sub was more than a few metres down, there was no safe way out.<br />\\"Swede\\" Momsen, a brilliant officer in the US Navy, set out to change all that. Haunted by the frustration of being unable to raise a stricken submarine before the air ran out and the crew died, he almost singlehandedly devised the hardware and the techiques for performing submarine rescue operations. He fought official lethargy and bureaucratic malice every step of the way, and when the USS Squalus went down off New England on 23 May 1939 and failed to surface, his goal was to save the crew.<br />He had tested his equipment and trained his divers in compression chambers and in calm waters, but out in the open sea, hundreds of feet down, the task was made incredibly difficult and dangerous. And there were only a few hours to act.<br />Peter Maas has written the story of Momsen and these terrible hours in a tight, tense narrative, based on the official reports and interviews with those few who survived both the sinking and the years of war to follow. This is a tale with a human dimension, and almost every one of the sailors is given a name and a reason for living. Intercut with the apalling slow pace of the rescue operations, we learn of the mounting press interest and the strain on the relatives ashore, who were initially told very little beyond the fact that the sub had gone down.<br />The rescue was successful, and all those who survived the initial sinking were saved, but the rescue itself is as tense a story as any I've read. Far too many times the whole enterprise was stalled, or hung up by errors or mishaps. At one stage 11 men were marooned in a diving bell hanging by a single strand of cable all but parted under the strain.<br />I felt the same way.<br />The final third of the book is devoted to the salvage and future history of the Squalus, another difficult and dangerous task supervised by Momsen, who found ways around frustrating obstacles, escaping instant death by a whisker at one stage.<br />If you have an interest in submarines, the navy, brilliant inventions, or just people in general, then you will enjoy this book.<br />This paperback edition could have used a few photographs and especially a diagram of the interior layout of the Squalus, but that is a minor niggle in this otherwise superb narrative. My hat is off to Swede Momsen, the sub's skipper LEUT Oliver Naiquin, and to Peter Maas himself for his work in bringing this story back from the past.	2002-04-19

Surprise (Aubrey / Maturin)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Voyage of Friendship	Captain Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy in the midst of the wars against Napoleon, and his particular friend Stephen Maturin, physician, naturalist and intelligence agent, journey from England to India and back in this epic of friendship. Along the way there are battles to be fought, storms to be weathered, and love to be found.<br />This is also the first book of the twenty-volume &quot;Aubreyad&quot; where we encounter the Surprise, that sleek, swift frigate which transports the two friends through so many other oceans and adventures.<br />But this is not your Napoleonic technothriller. No, this is a cut above Ramage, Bolitho, even Hornblower. This is literature, and there are observations on relationships between men, women, men and women, men and the sea, and the ultimate questions of the human existence, wrapped up in language wonderfully witty and hilariously humorous. This, and the others in the canon, are not books that will be read once lightly and forgotten. No, you will come back to them time and again for the pure pleasure of the reading and to discover something fresh each time.	2002-04-13

The war was won, everyone had a job, family values ruled, and the Dodgers were in Brooklyn.<br />What more could you want? Off-hand I can think of any number of things, beginning with an end to racial segregation, but at least in that respect the Dodgers showed the way.<br />It must have been some lucky fate that guided Roger Kahn over the Brooklyn bridge all those years ago. He could have written a series of articles and forgotten all about the time he spent with the Dodgers. But he didn't. He revelled in the team, got to know the players, manager, staff and owner. The way the dynamics worked, the internal politics, the inside information.<br />And then he recalled those golden days for us, along with the players, years and years later, in what has got to be the best baseball book ever written. We look back through his eyes, and the eyes of those boys of summer, at a magic moment in America's history.<br />Were they just doing their jobs, those golden boys? Just throwing and hitting a ball around? Or were they conscious of their role in history? Do we read things into this book that weren't there? Do we see that season through misty watercolour memories of the way we were?<br />Up to the reader, I guess, but for me, I go back time and again to Brooklyn and that great team, so superbly described by Roger Kahn.<br />If you love baseball (and who doesn't?) then you must read this book. To understand what once was, and will ever be so long as summer comes and young men gather to throw a baseball around a diamond.	2002-03-22

I have read and reread his books, working my way through his canon from beginning to end and taking solitary excursions via audiobooks as the fit takes me.<br />It is nothing for me to turn up at work after listening to a chapter or two, my words all antique, my phraseology rolling like the ocean, and my heart full of good cheer.<br />This second book of &quot;the Aubreyad&quot; is the most like Jane Austen's genteel tales of manners in the England of two centuries past. There are grand houses, elderly admirals, single young naval officers possessed of fortunes, and delightful young ladies. Romance is in the air before the book is fairly begun.<br />And yet there is another side, or rather sides. War and battle and financial problems interfere with the grand pursuit of love. Humour is everpresent, in the language, characters, settings and ships. The incompetent footpad who writes out an incredible recruiting poster. The scene with the bear. The verbal abuse in the middle of a battle of a sweet young lady disguised as a ship's boy.<br />It is also a complex maze of relationships. We do not meet Molly Harte again, but we encounter her cuckolded husband and his hatred of Jack Aubrey. The wonderful Diana Villiers makes her first appearance in these pages, eventually resulting in a severe quarrel between Captain Jack and his &quot;particular friend&quot; Stephen Maturin. Sir Joseph Blaine, the master of British Naval Intelligence and a rare collector of beetles plays a discreet game in the bureaucratic corridors of the Admiralty.<br />And there is action a-plenty at sea. Battles and chases, rigging and running, storms and ships.<br />Just open the book and you will be part of the crew.	2002-03-21

They got together and became booksellers on the most fragile of bases - the stationery was printed a year before they ever sold a book - but their friendship was firm, their enthusiasm vast and their knowledge immense.<br />They started off with a tiny stock, superbly described in their first catalogue, and built up their initial success, fuelling it with trips to postwar Europe where they happily trawled through centuries of printed rummage to unearth treasures for resale.<br />Every year they booked a trip, at first aboard ex-troopships, more latterly on airliners, and explored the labyrinthine world of booksellers and their wares. From the third floor of Marks and Co in Charing Cross Road to a secluded chateau outside Paris and all points in between they met and described in their diaries the amazingly colourful booksellers and their shops. A stack of Renaissance folios in the toilet, a rat in the basement, an ex-movie star, Russian emigres - I can hardly begin to describe the experiences they had and the people they met and charmed.<br />From the very first pages I can understand why they found their way into so many hearts. The excitement at finding a rare book for a song is genuine, the affection they feel for each other and their annual friends warming, and the language in which they describe it all is witty and engaging. One can almost smell the dusty, musty bookshops, the tottering stacks, the ricketty ladders, the clutter, calfskin and cellars of old world bookshops.<br />If you love books at all, then go forth and hunt down this one. It is a rare treasure in itself, an authentic feelgood odyssey through the world of booksellers, their wares and their curious habitats. A tag-team effort of both partners, it is a delight from beginning to end.	2002-03-21

His unique perspective is well reflected in this collection of stories about the first days of the space age.<br />In an astonishing odyssey, Guenter was there from the very first days of Mercury when they were still sending chimps up (and yes, he's got a few yarns about Ham and Enos) to the post-Challenger shuttle flights. His was the last face the crew saw before leaving earth and it must have given every astronaut the feeling that they were in safe hands.<br />Guenter was a hard man in a difficult job and he made a few enemies along the way, but he did it all in the name of safety. He enforced the rules and it didn't matter who was breaking them, they got short shrift from the pad leader. As it should be.<br />But he wasn't the unsmiling fuehrer some liked to portray him as. In this book his humour shines through on every page. He always had an eye for a practical joke and he could see the funny side of every situation.<br />This is a memoir of the space program that is more concerned with the men than the machines and systems. It's not that he doesn't describe the hardware and the missions, it's that he has a different take on it, a perspective focused up close and personal, rather than the view from Mission Control or one of the prime contractors in Long Island or California. He was there talking to the astronauts as their final straps were tightened and they reached out to clasp his hand before the hatch was sealed.<br />You know, I never get tired of hearing the grand story of Apollo, and Guenter's book fills in one of the empty corners very nicely. Not a book for those who love jargon and hardware and the voices of the heroes as they guide their craft through the void. Nor a book about goals and objectives and milestones and missions. No, this is a book about people, written by someone who cared.	2002-03-18

When Lieutenant Jack Aubrey Royal Navy meets Stephen Maturin, physician of Spain and Ireland, in the elegant music room of the Governor's house in Port Mahon at the dawn of the Nineteenth Century and in the middle of the Napoleonic wars, a friendship is begun which is one of the most remarkable in modern literature.<br />For twenty books we follow the adventures of this pair, around the world, in love and war, sun and storm, battle and peace, at sea and on land. The reader who stays with them - and it is not uncommon to read all twenty books, one after the other - is in for a feast, a remarkable journey through this world of sea-captains and their ladies, spies and spymasters, politicians, convicts, bureaucrats and soldiers. Grand ladies and scoundrels, thiefs, bailiffs and bums.<br />But I stray. This is the first volume, and like all the others it stands alone as a story. It is the story of Lucky Jack Aubrey and his cruises in the sloop HMS Sophie up and down the Mediterranean, but chiefly off the coasts of France and Spain. There is victory and promotion, death and failure, glory and satisfaction before we get to the end.<br />The atmosphere is unerringly authentic. Every word is researched, every setting, every ship, every part of a ship. We are taken aloft in a square-rigger, we man the guns in a sea-battle, and we line the rails as she comes home to port. All in exquisite detail.<br />But this is more than Hornblower or his later imitators. This is a step up. These battles and characters, settings and seamen are far, far more than the \\"fighting sail\\" equivalent of today's technothriller. No cardboard characters here! Every one is finely drawn, acting according to their own desires and ambitions, with their own habits and mannerisms. Here is Mowett, declaiming snatches of poetry, remarkably turgid poetry that was published by the yard in those days. (Thankfully we never hear more than a verse or two). Here is Killick, bringing in the Captain's salt horse, Midshipman Babbington interested in the ladies but amazingly coy about it. Barret Bonden, Tom Pullings - a host of characters!<br />The humour, the gentle good humour, sets this book aside from all the others with a sailing ship on the cover. There are wonderful jokes, there is restrained word play, there are hidden treasures of subtlety, for Patrick O'Brian was a deep old file, and every now and then he sets the reader up for a prank, all the more pleasurable for being found out and appreciated at its proper moment.<br />One remarkable aspect is the popularity of this series amongst the fairer sex. This is not a catalogue of sea-battles and nineteenth century naval technology, but a tale of manners and relationships that would do Jane Austen proud.<br />We feel for the characters, suffering and smiling with them as the narrative unfolds. And we can feel the relationships folding in turn - Jack and Stephen might begin the story as mere acquaintances, but they end as firm friends, one of the best and most pleasant friendships in literature.<br />For, rest assured, this is literature. A most amazingly pleasant novel-series that is both fun to read and yet contains enough deep insights and discussions of fundamental themes for any university course.<br />I must confess I am biased. I read Hornblower as a schoolboy and began reading his imitators - Bolitho, Ramage and the rest. I'd buy each book as they were published but as time went by I perservered with only one author, and the annual wait for the next Patrick O'Brian seemed to stretch out to double or triple the time. I have now read them all, for Patrick O'Brian died as the Twentieth Century ended, but I still read and re-read them for the sheer pleasure of the reading. And I am a busy man, with piles of wonderful books stacked high on my bedside table, but there is nothing in fiction quite so pleasant as to return to the dear old barky, hear the strains of Locatelli from the great stern-cabin, spy Killick waiting by the door with coffee and toasted cheese, and a cheery voice from the Gunroom cry \\"Rouse out another bottle there - can't you see we've got a guest?\\"<br />O happy meeting, and happy voyage in this first of a great novel series. Dear reader, do yourself a favour and plunge into this wonderful world. ...	2002-03-07

A good massage is more intimate than sex. Your partner is touching not just every part of your body, but handling your mind, calming, gentling, soothing, pleasuring, stimulating. The fragrance of the oil, the soft light, the low music in the background, all intended to work on your brain while your body is being kneaded and manipulated.<br />Gordon Inkeles does much the same for the reader. His words and the beautiful nude photography set the stage and work on the senses of the mind. Read a chapter and you'll want to gently remove your partner's clothing and try out the technique explained in words and pictures. If your partner is not within reach, the book heightens the anticipation until he or she is home again and in for a pleasant surprise.<br />Gordon makes the point that massage has changed since the days when masseurs saw the body as a target for correction, easing sprains, directed towards a specific medical or sporting end. He demonstrates that massage is for fun and shared pleasure, an end in itself.<br />The book has thirteen sections, covering aids to massage, the various strokes, parts of the body, erotic massage etc. All strokes are shown in detail. Be warned, if nudity is likely to bother you, that this book is not coy or reserved. The models are completely nude and there are no carefully draped towels. The photography is tasteful in both colour and black and white. It enhances the atmosphere, and moves a step away from the clinical approach taken by other books.<br />Above all, the point is made that massage is an intimate, shared experience, a meeting of minds as well as bodies.<br />As I say, this is my very favorite massage book, as much for its attitude as anything else. Recommended for enjoyment! Shared enjoyment.	2002-02-18

But time and again Bamford slips behind the scenes, behind the walls of secrecy, to tell the world the intimate secrets of the NSA.<br />This, even after so many years, is the definitive history of the National Security Agency. Or at least the most definitive work ever to have been available to the general public. It starts at the start in World War One, and traces the development of what has become a monster, frequently acting beyond the law and in clear violation of basic rights of privacy and freedom of speech.<br />It is not a history of codebreaking or of the science of interception, but rather a history of the organisation that was set up to do this, and though we are told of the machines and systems that do the work, the tale revolves around the people who defended their secrets and sought out others.<br />It is fascinating reading, pitched at an average understanding, and accessible to the people who should be most concerned about the activities of the NSA. If it has a flaw it is a simple one - it needs updating.<br />In the wake of the S11 tragedies, it is indisputable that there is a need for such an organisation. Never let it be said otherwise. But what of the collateral damage to millions of innocent individuals, American citizens with nothing but love for their country, who are regularly spied upon by the NSA?<br />A disturbing and thoughtful book.<br />Recommended reading for anybody with an interest in codebreaking and communications security.

Listen as she recites the Tao, the melody of her voice blending with the chuckling sound of the water over polished stones. Here and there she offers a word or two of her own understanding, but, like the Tao herself, her own thoughts are sparse and beautiful.<br />When I pick up and open this book, I feel like I am sitting in a green forest, the poet beside me, and everything I see has a deep and precious meaning. I am at peace.<br />I have many translations of the Tao, but this is one of my very favorites. It doesn't preach or offer scholarly interpretations or commentaries, it is a friend, a comfortable friend, and I love it.	2002-02-13

Tom Clancy must be the world's number one fan of the USA Military.<br />And vice versa.<br />&quot;Airborne&quot; is another in the series of mutual admiration society books written by Tom beginning with Submarine, and progressing on through Fighter Wing, Marine, Armoured Cav and others.<br />Each one is an in depth look at the men, equipment, training, tactics and history of a segment of the US Armed Services. Tom doesn't give a dry list of statistics, a few cutaway diagrams and photos, no this is hands-on stuff, straight from the people who use the weapons, supplemented by Tom's observations on a guided tour of the facilities and attendance at a training exercise.<br />I'd give this a top rating, but for the graphics, which aren't up to the standard of earlier books. Many of the photographs, for instance, are literaly the size of a postage stamp.<br />But that's a minor niggle, and there are some excellent photos, and diagrams.<br />What comes across very strongly is the awesom esprit de corps of the Airborne. Far more than any other units, Airborne soldiers fight alone without the direct support of other arms, excepting maybe the airforce. But if an airborne force goes into action on the far side of the world, where friendly runways are few and far between, then they are very much on their own until reinforcements win through.<br />The unique tactics of the airborne units are highlighted. The &quot;LGOP&quot; mentality, where Little Groups Of Parachutists form up and fight through to the objective. The way that subunits are divided up amongst aircraft so that if one aircraft doesn't make it, it doesn't take out an entire platoon or company.<br />There's more, a lot more, and I particularly liked the historical chapters. Right at the end of the book is a glossary, almost de rigeur for the acronym-laden world of the military, and most valuable of all for those wanting yet more, a very comprehensive bibliography.<br />This is a book that belongs on the shelf of anymilitary buff, alongside Tom Clancy's other works. Highly recommended.	2002-02-06

The decade when the USA went from being an also-ran to defining space travel for the world. And Gene Krantz was there from the time they poured the foundations of NASA's Houston complex to the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot upon the Moon.<br />And beyond. The Apollo 13 crisis is perhaps the flight that sums up Gene Krantz. Failure is not an option, he declared and for a week while the world sat on the edges of their seats and three astronauts soared on the edge of a lonely distant death, Gene Krantz and his team planned and struggled and worked to bring them home safely.<br />What a triumph that was when they finally splashed down, and Gene lit up his cigar, wearing his famous vest. There were tears of triumph in his eyes and mine as I relived those days and shared the emotions.<br />Triumph. That is the word that I associate with Gene.<br />His book is his essence distilled. Four-square, no-nonsense, straight up and down. He did his job, he will tell you. No more, no less. Yet if you read between the lines you will see an extraordinary dedication to his job. Even more extraordinary when you consider that dedication was the norm for a whole generation of aerospace engineers. Gene surpassed them all.<br />OK. Enough of the flag-waving. It's that sort of book, full of pride and emotion. It's also chock full of anecdotes, stories, character observations and behind-the scenes glimpses of the man who was Flight.<br />I'd give it five stars, but for the fact that it's a little dry, a little restrained, a little too straight up and down. But I don't think it's in Gene to be relaxed and laid back.<br />Highly recommended, in its own right as a great book on the space race, and as part of the Apollo story.	2002-02-04

In an organisation full of legends, Christopher Columbus Kraft was THE legend. <br />He'd been with NASA since before it was NASA, working on stability problems with Mustang fighters, and he recounts the frustration and worry he felt when a test pilot took up a new \\"fix\\" and the radio remained silent after the flight plan called for violent manouevring.<br />Had it worked? Had it failed catastrophically under stress? Eventually Chris couldn't stand it any longer, he got on the radio and asked for a report. The taciturn test pilot assured him that everything was fine.<br />As NACA became NASA, moved from Chris's childhood home of Virginia to Texas, and the test pilots became astronauts, he was the man who worked out the mission control system and became the first flight director. Space was a whole new environment, the rockets and capsules were incredibly complicated and everything was different. Just communicating with an astronaut on the far side of the world was a major challenge.<br />This is the story of how Chris Kraft solved that challenge and many many more along the way as the early Mercury missions turned into the more sophisticated Gemini and finally the incredibly complex and dangerous Apollo missions.<br />I've been reading books on the space program for years, decades now, and the more I know, the more in awe I am of people like Chris, who invented a lot of the systems that we now take for granted. I am just amazed that people, even highly intelligent and skilled people, could take on such an enormous task and bring it off successfully.<br />He writes in a matter of fact way about how it was all done, and he is generous with praise for others. He tells a few new stories, and he fleshes out old familiar tales, with his own retelling of the Apollo 11 triumph.<br />But through all of it, he remains the guy who invented the fixesfor the problems, the engineer on the other end of the radio link, even if the control tower has now expanded to a massive building housing hundreds of controllers and the test pilot in the Mustang is now a quarter of a million miles away on the far side of the Moon. We still share his feelings, his tension when things go wrong, his relief and joy when they succeed.<br />Like Chris, I guess very few of us reading his book, or these words, will ever fly in space. But we can share the excitement, the sense of wonder, the hope for the future when we read what this legend has to say, and we look up at the night sky and the moon and think about those great days.<br />Highly recommended, in its own right as a great book on the space race, and as part of the Apollo story.	2002-01-31

He focussed on building up tone through meticulous hatching and shading. (And outlining and measuring - very obsessive but rewarding.)<br />This book also focuses on tone rather than line, this time in charcoal and without the rather anal measuring and outlining.<br />In fact it is far more accessible to the average life student, because the methods Graves uses can likewise be used in a life class. You don't need days and days of posing. Nor do you need the foundation drawing skills required by the other book. This is a book which can be put to immediate use.<br />And very valuable it is, too. Expect an improvement in your results the first time you put the lessons taught by Graves to use. You will find yourself looking at your model as a collection of tonal areas, rather than lines, and consequently your drawings will have more shape to them. They will be brought to life.<br />The essence of Graves' method is to work with two tools - charcoal and a chamois. Tones are built up with the charcoal, and the chamois is used to lighten them. One early exercise uses a \\"wash\\" of charcoal to create a background and then shapes are picked out with the chamois to make the drawing. Darker values such as shadows are added with more charcoal.<br />The book starts with the basics. Tools, media and techniques. All illustrated and described, along with exercises illustrated for the student.<br />Chapters are presented as exercises, each focused on a different topic. Lines and shadows, proportions, alignments, composition and so on, each building on the last. Step by step the final image is built up from broad tonal masses to detailed shapes. Construction lines are shown and at each step Graves tells us precisely what he is doing and why.<br />I particularly liked the illustrated explanation of the difference between lines and outlines. The body has lines, such asthe creases formed when folding the elbow, and outlines, being the imaginary line where the body finishes and the background begins. Drawing body lines reflects reality, but drawing outlines imposes something that isn't there - we don't see bodies surrounded by lines - if the background and the body are the same colour they blend into each other, they don't form a line. Graves uses negative shapes to help define the outline, a much more natural and satisfactory method.<br />Graves shows and tells in a pleasant, consistent manner how to improve our techniques. There is something here for all levels, but this book is perhaps best used by an intermediate artist rather than a beginner or an expert. A few basic skills help to get right into it, and if you are already achieving good results you may not feel happy about changing your ways.<br />Having said that, Graves provides plenty of flexibility and new ideas to add to an existing skill base. This book *will* help you improve your style.<br />Highly recommended to anybody with an interest in drawing the nude. Especially valuable to students attending life class for the first time.	2002-01-30
US	50089643	R3LQFADRNKBQ2Q	0823003035	95149309	The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective On the Classical Tradition	Books	5	111	113	N	N	Beautiful people, beautiful pictures.	If you are looking for an introductory book to ease you into being a whiz in life class, this is not it.<br />The techniques described are time-consuming and require a steady eye and hand - not something the average beginner has a lot of, with five or twenty minute poses and a wobbly easel.<br />But if you can get a model to hold the same pose for hours, possibly over several sessions, and you have some experience in figure drawing, then you may find this book extremely valuable.<br />Anthony Ryder talks the reader through the techniques, step by detailed step, aiming for understanding rather than slavish repetition. His method is logical and elegant, and if understood and practised, may result in some extremely good drawings.<br />Don't expect overnight success, however - there is a lot that is required before you can even start with this book. You'll need to know basic techniques with your media, be able to judge angles and proportions, have a good understanding of anatomy, and probably be able to handle a model in adopting the same pose session after session.<br />There is a good reason why most of the drawings in this book are of reclining models. Standing poses simply cannot be held for the amount of time it takes to achieve the same results. You'll need at least half an hour just to achieve the basic outline, probably more.<br />But having said all of the above, I must now state that this book is proof positive that Ryder's techniques work, are reproducible and can result in images of stunning beauty.<br />You still have to select a model and a pose, and this is another basic skill required, but Ryder is obviously a master at this, and the book is filled with drawings of the nude that are simply breathtaking in their beauty. Model, pose, arrangement and execution are all perfect. Classically elegant.<br />This is a book that rewards the eye as much as the mind, and it is a feast for both. If you aspire to greatness in your figure drawing, then buy this book, study it, and apply the lessons.<br />Recommended for artists of moderate experience. Highly recommended.	2002-01-28

Just about everything.<br />Step by step guides from pose to painting are frequent - we see inside an artist's studio, palette, thought processes and techniques. As a beginner in life drawing, I found this book my number one resource whenever I wanted to practice and follow up what I had learnt in class.<br />Not an in-depth guide to a narrow subject, this book's breadth is its strong point. An ideal starting place, but without stopping too soon and leaving the user or reader wanting more. A perfect mix of overview and detail, in my opinion.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-28

Another serve of drowned baby!	Which I've just got it for you here, ain't I?<br />If you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin naval fiction novels of Patrick O'Brian, there is one theme underscoring the appearance of Captain Jack Aubrey RN, and that is food, whether it be the weevilly sea biscuit and salt horse of the midshipmans' berth or the prodigious dishes served in the great cabin aft.<br />They are wonderful dishes with wonderful names. drowned baby is a dessert. Sea pie contains no fish. Spotted dog is not a dalmation. We are given tantalising glimpses into their nature, but recipes are not to be had. Patrick O'Brian was a wizard with words, but no cook.<br />The deficiency is rectified in this invaluable companion to the canon. Every dish is tracked down and recreated. The authors not only give the recipe, but tell you precisely how to do it for those unfamiliar with the utensils and methods (and ingredients) of a bygone age.<br />I cannot recommend this book too highly, but I must issue a hearty warning. Do not partake of the dishes described without at least a dozen mates to help you eat them! Or you will wind up as stout as Captain Jack.<br />And mind you lay in a good stock of madeira, sillery and port for atmosphere.<br />A glass of wine with you, dear reader!	2002-01-22

I have never seen before or since a better pass - right over the house. I waved up and tried to kid my kid that I'd arranged the deal just for him.<br />I've read Foale's book, I've read Dragonfly, and I've read a few other accounts of life aboard the dilapidated Mir space station. Jerry's account is a personal one, and like any other astronaut he talks about himself and his experience, but he also gives a good picture of conditions aboard and the tensions between crew members and ground control. It must have been a very challenging environment in a spacecraft filled with garbage and outdated equipment, requiring constant attention, in a space program kept aloft by political commitments rather than any real scientific need.<br />It is good to read Jerry's side of the story and to see how he dealt with the inefficiencies, the corruption and the constant malfunctions of the program. We haven't heard the last of Mir just yet, and I look forward to seeing an increasingly complete account of the flights coming out over the years to come.<br />I'll agree that Dragonfly is the more balanced account, a real eye-opener in its own right, but Jerry Linenger's account fills a gap in the story, and I can recommend it to any space junkie wanting a fix.	2002-01-22

The flight controllers must have been tearing their hair out as the atmosphere quickly deteriorated into a brown haze and there were no good splashdown sites available.<br />There are other funny stories, and yes the tale of Enos the chimp was also a good one. But there are also moments of tragedy, as astronauts and cosmonauts died along the way.<br />Another view is that of the astronauts' wives, who had a great deal to put up with - housewife one day, media celebrity the next. And by extension all the hundreds of thousands of workers who devoted their lives to Apollo, and left the wife at home, maybe sharing a Saturday night together. A whole generation of engineers missed out on family life.<br />I've read many of these books, and it seems to me that the best of them are coming out now, long after it matters about politics and reputations and hiding the shortcomings and failures. I note the technical errors, but this is a book by a reporter, who had other things to do at the time, other stories to tell. It's not an engineer's book, nor an astronaut's book, it's the book of someone who was close to the program, but made a living from words rather than machines or missions.<br />And the atmosphere is what counts in this book - you get a sense of what made these people tick.<br />A lot of anecdotes I hadn't heard before makes it good value to begin with, but if I had to recommend a book to get the feel of the space race to those children of latter days who didn't grow up with it, this would be it.	2002-01-20

My mother was horrified and called in the religious nazis to make me see the true light, but they couldn't save me!<br />Carl Sagan is someone I've been watching and reading since the mid 70s, and I've come to respect his views, based on solid science, he has the ability to make me expand my thinking, and this book is no exception.<br />The Dragons of Eden goes beyond the familiar terrain of high school evolution, the giraffe's neck, the development of fins and legs and hands and eyes. No this is ground-breakingly new, a journey into the evolution of what sits just behind my eyes - so different and yet so intimate that I couldn't put this book down.<br />There is a LOT to think about here, and though it is a bit dated here in the 21st Century, years after Sagan himself died untimely, it is a seminal work, and one I love dearly.<br />Highly recommended for all thinking creatures.	2002-01-16

Here are Patrick O'Brian's prototypes for Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. Younger, less well developed, and not quite the same, but this pair, this Jack and Toby, are recognisably the forerunners of the more famous friend whose adventures span twenty books.<br />As a long-time fan of the Aubreyad, i can guarantee that any reader familiar with the later books will enjoy this one just as much. We see many of the same scenes, the same phrases, the same habits, the same minor characters as we see later, and it is a pleasure to realise that these are the first times that Patrick O'Brian used the same evocative words that he would re-use time and again in later books.<br />It is like meeting old friends afresh, and when I read these two books after putting down the twentieth and last in the Aubrey/Maturin series, it was as if I'd found another, a twenty-first.<br />The book opens with a homage to Jane Austen, as many of O'Brian's books do, and there is a considerable setting-up of the relationship on land before they join Commodore Anson's squadron. Tobias gets himself into a right pickle and Jack gets him out of it in the nick of time in a scene which is at once dramatic and comical.<br />At sea Tobias learns the ropes and makes the most of his opportunities for natural history, as Stephen Maturin does later. Jack is the young sea-dog, every bit the young Jack Aubrey, except he does not share Aubrey's grosser appetites.<br />After Cape Horn, well I'd be giving away too much of the plot if I mentioned what went on, but suffice to say that this is some of Patrick O'Brian's most powerful writing, and at one stage I felt tired and worn out just reading it. I almost had to check my hands to see if they were not rubbed raw from the oars.<br />But our heroes return home at last, and the story concludes with words which are pure O'Brian.<br />There is no doubt in my mind, no doubt at all. If you liked the Aubrey/Maturin series, you will like The Unknown Shore. And while you'reat it, try the earlier Golden Ocean as well - they make a fine pair of prequels to the series.	2002-01-16

He has uncovered many of the secrets that O'Brian would have preferred to remain hidden, and he has given an insight into the literary background and writing style of O'Brian that will delight anybody interested in his works, especially the twenty volume epic canon of Captain Jack Aubrey RN and Surgeon Stephen Maturin FRS. <br />King has dug deep into O'Brian's family, discovering spies, crank doctors, salty seadogs, bad fathers and errant husbands enough for a whole shelf full of fiction. He has chronicled O'Brian's life through its several changes, especially the golden afternoon of his writing career, when he was discovered by the world's readers and became a heroic figure, writing best-seller after best-seller from his vineyard home in the South of France. <br />While in many ways it is an intrusion that Patrick O'Brian would have been apalled to see published, it is also a tribute by one of his foremost fans.

It is a personal look at dinosaurs by a man who knows his subject intimately, and he makes his case in an engaging and very readable fashion. <br />I've been fascinated by dinosaurs since before I can remember, my parents bought me dinosaur books for my early birthdays, and I bought this book for a somewhat later present to myself.<br />To anybody contemplating buying, all I can say is: if you like dinosaurs and you are even halfway of a scientific bent, then buy this book!<br />A very good read, virtually unput-downable, and profusely illustrated in an elegant style by the author's own hand.	2002-01-11

DON'T read this on any form of public transport. You will chuckle, chortle, laugh out loud, guffaw, and eventually find yourself upside-down out of your seat gasping for breath and giggling feebly whilst the other passengers contemplate you with pity, sympathy and the Heimlich Manouevre.<br />It is hilarious, no two ways about it.<br />But, as others have noted, you need to be a fan of Patrick O'Brian's books to get the full impact, otherwise most of the broadsides will sail in one eye and out the other. For those who know what Susan is talking about, this book is a hoot.<br />It is a gem, and it was one of the hilarious highpoints of my life to read it for the first time. I don't think my sides have stopped aching since.<br />Susan is a deep thinker, and I am afraid that she lapses into philosophy towards the end. Good stuff, to be sure, but I was hoping for more sustained laughter and I was disappointed at actually having to engage my brain to get through it all.<br />But, that minor niggle aside, this is a great book for fans of Patrick O'Brian, and there is a joke on every page. A joke in every sentence on some pages, and these are where you need to tighten your seatbelt to survive the trip!	2002-01-03

There are appearances by JFK and Wernher von Braun, but the central characters are his parents, his friends who help him construct rockets, and the community of Coalwood. Entertaining, instructive and inspiring all at once, it is a gem of a book.<br />And all the better for being true. One of his rockets made it into space eventually.	2002-01-03

I do not find it hard to believe that a first novel could cover 1 200 pages. What I find hard to believe is that such a novel could be published without it being sliced down to a manageable size.<br />It is a testament to Stroyar's skill that she succeeded with this mammoth offering. It is well researched, well written, beautifully constructed and finely paced. We keep on getting revelations that give new insights into the lives of the central characters.<br />If I have any criticism, it is that the central premise is a trifle forced - the Underground has the very person with the right mix of skills and experience drive up to them in the few hours of safety available to him before being discovered.<br />But that is a minor niggle. This alternate history is not just credible, it is a very finely detailed look at an alternate society, an alternate reality. And in the process, it has something to say about the human condition and ablout our own reality.<br />I picked up this book on the off-chance that it would deal with a military history of an alternate reality, but far from being disappointed that it did not, I continued deeper and deeper into this fascinating tale. One of the best books I've read this year.<br />A fine effort at a first novel and I look forward to seeing another!	2001-12-31

The science of codebreaking and codemaking is usually a subject guaranteed to glaze the eyes of all but the most devoted. Technical details abound and the reader is led through lots of alphabet soup.<br />Usually.<br />Not this time. The codebreakers of WW2 were an eccentric lot, it turns out, all brilliant, many fatally flawed. Leo Marks (son of the bookseller who established the famous 84 Charing Cross Road shop) is no exception. Brilliant.<br />And flawed in that he had a deep attachment to the agents sent overseas, often with totally inadequate codes. This is the story of his long hours, days and years spent in helping them and improving the codes. The difference in codes was quite literally between life and death, often with hideous torture intervening.<br />When I say &quot;flawed&quot;, I mean that he wasn't the sort of cog-in-the-machine toe-the-line public servant fighting the war from a comfy chair. He bucked the system and was on the constant verge of dismissal or promotion. Unconventional to a fault. Always with one distant eye on agents deep in Occupied Europe, operating with radio sets the size of suitcases, tapping out messages in Morse while German direection-finding vans zeroed in on them.<br />And his unconventional book is a delight, a joy to read. It is more than well written, it is a work of literature in its own right. Quite simply, it is as brilliant as its author.<br />But be warned, dear reader. You will need a handkerchief to mop up the tears. Sometimes from laughter, sometimes from sadness. This is a book that will insert probes into the deepest parts of your mind and tickle the emotion centres, sometimes pleasure and pain at once. I can't really describe it, but this book somehow joins your subconscious mind to the author's and you share his thoughts in a way that is both intimate and completely natural. I have never met another book that comes close.<br />There's enough detail to satisfy those with an interest in codes, the story is welltold, it is full of fascinating characters, fraught with tension all the way through, but the joy of reading this book is in the words and sentences. Puns and wordplay abound. I am on the last pages even as I write these words, but though I have boxes of books, good books, excellent books to read, I shall reread this one again immediately.<br />And enjoy it all the more, I am sure.<br />Leo Marks, I wish you had written this book decades ago, and followed it up with many more in the same vein.	2001-11-02

Hamish, in a few words, made clear to me the incredible difficulties of controlling spacecraft and retrieving information from a vast distance. The environment is absolutely unforgiving and there are no second chances. The planning and the execution have to be perfect.<br />The book itself is astounding. It is far more image-rich than any of the recent memoirs and histories, with photographs, maps, diagrams, cartoons, paintings on every page, rather than a few black and white shots grouped in the middle. The images themselves are chosen with care and matched to the text - I was impressed with two of the earliest photographs of the Lunar Module, almost lost against the immensity of the lunar landscape, a reminder of just how fragile and precious was this little bubble of Earth.<br />Sometimes it seems as if I've read the same story of Apollo many times over from slightly different viewpoints, with just a few little nuggets of &quot;newness&quot; to savour. With this book, Hamish has given us a whole new perspective on the adventure, and I've got to say that he has also given this reader a feeling of excitement and enthusiasm that is hard to gain from the more buttoned-down writings of the US astronauts, flight controllers and engineers.<br />It might be a cliche, but this book puts you there. You are with the astronauts as they gaze up at that black sky stretching on forever, floating in space between Earth and Moon on a spacewalk, with the controllers at moments of extreme tension, and sitting beside the communications specialists as they juggle radio frequencies to retrieve faint radio signals from unimaginable distances.<br />Forget science fiction, forget Apollo 13, forget The Dish. This isthe real thing, told with a real sense of wonder by someone who knows his stuff and wants to share his feelings, his knowledge with you. If you care about space travel, about the greatest adventure of all time, this book belongs on your bookshelf, on your bedside table, in your hands. It's a thriller.	2001-06-14

I've spent many a long and happy hour aboard literary ships, from Viking longboats to modern warships, and perhaps my fondest times were spent with Horatio Hornblower or Jack Aubrey in the days of fighting sail.<br />Here is a prize to be snapped up, a feast to be savoured, an illustration on every page, working through from the earliest ship paintings of royal barges carring Pharoahs up the Nile to Charles Turner's painting of Britain's last battleship being towed to the breakers.<br />In between there are hundreds of pictures, every one carefully selected and described. The illustrations are evocative - I'm looking at an early passenger liner now and I can all but smell the coal smoke, feel the spray on my face from the waves and hear the comments of the passengers lining the rails as they cruise past.<br />The text is focussed on the painters - there are many, many long columns devoted to the artists, their lives, their styles, their main works. We learn of the various schools and techniques and developments in the field of nautical illustration. But the artists are the focus, as they should be, and this is a very human book - I felt at times that I was standing behind an artist, looking over his shoulder as he captured the essence of some mighty ship. Or of some cameo, passengers on a liner, fishermen cleaning their nets, small boats serving a fleet anchored in the background.<br />Eminently readable, it provides the authorative background for the real reason I bought this book - the illustrations. This is a book I can lose myself in, sailing away on waves that have long since spent themselves, on ships that are but memories now, with painters, dust themselves but living fresh and new in these pages.	2001-03-21
