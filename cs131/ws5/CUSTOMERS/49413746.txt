Morals are laid out, people changed, money rules all. Even some flaky romance. Mr. Grisham doesn't let you down in this one. I admit the end had me wanting more. All fans of the author and new ones in the waiting should pick it up. Look forward to his next one.	2003-04-29

Lucas gets the help of former cops in the area to help him. He, as is goes, looks good in the end. Rinker is beyond herself in this one as she adds extra weapons to her arsenel. Her feelings are shown as well. Very interesting stuff in this on. If you're a fan of the series it's a must. If not you'll like it too.	2002-07-17

Some real good side plots. Had me guessing all along. The author did his job well. I hope to get some more of these great charaters in the future, I'm looking forward to the next in this line, much as I do for the Alex Cross books. Only thing I could say was weird is, revolvers don't have clips and the Glock definately doesn't have a safety. Then again I'm not the worlds greatest speller either. A must for fans of the author.	2002-04-24

Maybe I expected too much. The vampire stuff was kinda interesting, as was Alex and Jamilla. Other good characters like his family and crew from his job, as well as the FBI. Suspense at the end with old foe the Mastermind, wait til you find out who it is. Had me stunned. All in all, I'd recommend it to Patterson fans. As always, I look forward to the next Alex Cross story.	2002-04-04

Great Characters like Ray, Harry Rex, Forrest and the post humous Judge. The plot had me wondering until the very end. The suspense of the money and the side story of the woes of Forrest gave me alot to relate to. The tales of the honorable Judge were well put. The description of the settings were nice and made me able to feel them. A must for Grisham fans.	2002-02-28

Alot of things going on in Web's world, enough to keep you occupied as the story plays out. As always, there are great characters to add to the main one. The insight and knowledge that Baldacci uses add more than we knew prior to picking up the book. I recommend it to fans of Mr. Baldacci and to those who like an action packed book.	2002-02-26

Mr. Feinstein did a masterful job with the golfers he choose to highlight. The terms and ways of the tour as explained early on, continued as the book went on, until, I as a reader had them down pat. The tales ranging from Q school to superstar money makers gave all a fair shot. I found it almost Carnac-like his take on Bruce Fleisher looking forward to the Senior Tour. Who would have ever thought an average pro would out do the Watsons, Kites, Millers and Nelsons. Overall a must for the golfing golf fan of the sport.	2001-08-21

Without giving to many details, I'll leave it at this: if you like books by the author, this is a must read.	2001-04-30

His marvelous style and heroics make this a good read. The villan or villans change as the story moves on. His remarkable relationship with his family and partner shine through as usual.

Decent story of Luke and family struggling to make it in farm country Arkansas. Likened it to &quot;Wish you Well&quot; and &quot;To kill a mockingbird&quot;. Not the best I've read in awhile, but an entertaining piece of work. A little disappointed in the ending. I'd say, overall, if you prefer Grishams regular work, you should like this. A change of pace for his fans.	2001-04-14

I found the forefront when the author describes how he uses certain characters to be interesting. Mr. Mahoney uses some real life in his work. Always informative stuff. Kinda hard to believe plot, but none the less an exciting book. The dealings with alcoholism, I find to be accurate. Although, make no mistake about it, a majority need the help of others to maintain long-term sobriety. McKenna is a rare breed of drunk who doesn't need help(AA or the like) to stay clean. His inside the head thoughts as the author puts them in print make for some of the best stuff in the book.I look forward to the next book, having read all of the good books by Mr. Mahoney.	2001-04-11

This one is no exception. Good story, that had me guessing. The main character, Lindsay, seems so real you can feel her pain and excitment. The crew, including her gal pals, makes for some good reading. The ADA, the ME, and the reporter all add some nice touches. Her partner, Chris, adds a strong supporting role. The chase of the killer and the eventual capture are excellent. Had me thinking the whole way. Good, Quick read, but very entertaining. The ending makes me think there's more to come.	2001-04-02

I was trying for an Alex Cross featured one at the library but got this one. No regrets. Good story here with Maggie always questioning herself as to whether she's a murderess or just a victim of circumstance. Will Sheppards story was equally good. The best was when the two were together. Good side characters with Barry, Norma, Allie and Jennie. Well put together. Only exception being Maggie held in Bedford Hills C.F.(State Prison) before trial instead of Westchester County Jail. All things told, I liked the story and look forward to reading all of Mr. Patterson's work.	2001-03-31

Lucas has three ladies to worry about, but the sexy Jael is his main squeeze in this one. Weather is almost back in the picture. Del, the chief, Sloan and Sherrill all have a hand in it. The two different killers add a new flavor. I have to admit I prefer the standard Sandford of one crazy on the run. Though this one will keep fans of the series interested. I'm glad I started reading these books and look forward to the ones upcoming.	2001-03-23

Kind of hard to believe. But that combined with the trials and tribulations of Frannie and Tom Brennan, make for an interesting read. The School people, the Doctors, Frannies so called friends, all play a role. Tom, let down before by the Bureau, is on his own here. With the help of Frannie, Max and the others school kids they come out in decent shape. Mr. Patterson had me going during this one. Give it a shot.	2001-03-16

Mr. Mahoneys insight on the NYPD is second to none. He combines made-up characters with real people to form a great plot. This story piting McKenna Verses a Doctor/Killer is truly engaging. Not as much behind the scene stuff with McKenna and family. I kind of liked it that way. More of this good murder/mystery came about. Interesting characters, whose careers you can follow by reading the whole series. All in all a great act. I look forward to Edge of the City(the only one of the series I haven't read) and all new works by the author. Thanks to my friend that lent me my 1st Mahoney.	2001-03-10

The rich and well to do have trouble in their sect and Lucas has his hands full once again. The start with the hunting, the stuggle for power in the bank, the suspense of who the suspects are make a good story. Lucas a has attacks on his loved ones as well. Through it he manges his usual affair with a fine lady, this time a co-worker. The cast, Sloan, The chief, Del, Loring, Sherril all live up to their billing. The &quot;Cancun&quot; ending had me laughing. Again I look forward to the two &quot;Prey&quot; series books I've yet to read.	2001-02-28

Turned out to be very entertaining. Good work on the carrier stuff with the Navy. Good side stories with the CIA, congressmen, navy chaplain. But the intriguing part was early with the F-14 pilots going ashore, it led to the main story. If you like stuff with fighters and bombers this one is it. The politics surrounding it add a good flavor. The chain of command takes a beating at times but plays a role. Good wins out over evil at all costs.	2001-02-19
US	49413746	R3BQUJYR5Y22VE	0671041789	867268465	The Green Mile	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very Good Story	I have reviewed this book before, but feel the need to do it one more time. I just saw the movie and it was a close facsimile of the book. I was a NYS corrections officer for 15 1/2 years. When I read the book I imagined the Mile as the one that was at Sing-Sing. While I didn't work there in the electric chair days, the old area is still an active part of the jail in another capacity. So I had an idea of how the Mile was supposed to look and the image in my mind helped comprehend the book. Apparently most old death rows were set up the same. The interesting characters in the book and movie were enough to keep the long movie interesting. Rarely do books and their movies share so much in common. I've already reviewed it so I won't re-review it. I just wanted to shed this light on it.	2001-02-11

No FBI, people on the run, government officals. Good and bad in a different way. I found it very &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; like. The young characters were interesting. The older ones quite wise. The lawyer, Cotton, was excellent in this one. The early differences between the two children and their great-grandmother get overcome and a beautiful relationship becomes of it. The childrens faith in her and their ill mother is apparent. The nasty neighbor and family add a nice twist. The overall feeling of &quot;Who needs the money&quot;, although odd at first, seemed very natural by books end. Life is much less complicated without an over abundance. Don't expect your normal ration of Baldacci, but none-the-less, something special	2001-02-11
US	49413746	R3EJL19AI1XZJM	0425137562	525066589	Silent Prey	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Each one becomes a favorite	This book, my fifth of the series, impressed me. The adaptable Lucas taking on New York. The old nemesis, Bekker, up to no good again. As he attempts to fool the authories in a new way. His over drugging, if you would, continues his fury. A group of vigilante cops in NY add to the thriller, As Lucas has to dig deep to uncover all that is wrong. His womanizing contiues with an old flame and a new interest. The higher up corruption in the book add an interesting line. Overall a good read. I continue to be impressed with the series and am going to seek out a few more of the &quot;Prey&quot; series.	2001-02-07

The ever present Lucas, has his work cut out for him in this thriller. His badboy attitude helps him attain his goal of catching the Psycho in this one. The wealthy family and innocent hostages add to the drama. As well as the police department details. My 1st knowledge of Davenports side business being involved so much in the plot. Was an excellent story, kept me going. For murder mystery, Sandford is a great way to go.	2001-02-02

I had saw the movie some time ago, but found the book to be more in-depth, as most books are. Not my favorite of Mr. Baldaccis, but a thriller none the less. Luther, the star early on, passes the torch to Jack and Det. Frank. The events towards the end made up for the few lulls in the middle. Strong characters, Sullivans, Baldwins, the law firm make for an overall good read. The corruption at the top of the governmental scale was very evident and interesting. As I say I enjoyed it, and look forward to &quot;Wish you well&quot; by Mr. Baldacci.	2001-01-28

Lucas D. always a force on the force. This one has some of his personal stuff revealed. Ever the ladies man, Lucas comes through as the guy most men want to be like. Although the baggage along with that is revealed in this one. The Villan, Dr. Bekker, an abuser of all drugs(so it seems), is an almost worthy opponent. Lt. Lucas Davenport has a strong supporting cast. The story kept me going. The end seems to lead directly to the next book of the series. I look forward to the next book of the series.	2001-01-24

I got this one, the 1st in the series..Pretty good cat and mouse with the maddog and his victims. Lucas the main player, a term not yet coined when the book was written, plays the main role. He, a supercop, ladies man, marksman, and game inventor, is a little much, but a good character non the less. The clever maddog is over matched. Lucas still carries on with his life, as it should be in good versus evil. The book was probably ultra-modern 12 years ago with the computer game stuff. I give Mr. Sandford credit for the start of a good series.	2001-01-14

Good character, Alex Cross. Honest, hardworking, smart. You can feel his goodness with his family as the book goes on. The turmoil in his Force, his partners, boss is evident as well. The villan, Shafer, is a rather interesting chap as well. The battle of wills between he and Cross are as good as i've read in awhile. Good, solid detective work in this one. If you like murder-mystery, with a few twists, check this one out. I look forward to more Patterson books.	2001-01-05

Reading this gave me alot of the missing parts of Det McKenna's story. This one was good, alot of real cop stuff with whos got the best &quot;hook&quot;, which bosses are on the ball, the nicknames, and mostly the treating of dinner. The storyline was interesting. If you did like me and read Mahoneys others 1st, do like me and read this one. The character does all the real things cops do, spiced up some for the storys sake, but not overboard. The way Mckenna and Brunette met was something. On the farm as its known. I believe Mahoney could have went further into the perils of those who end up on the farm, but the interest in a book on that would'nt interest many. The denial of it and the false reality that some can quit drinking and remain normal on a daily basis, isnt a topic of interest. The truth be told, in jobs where ego, power, and dealing with the less desirables of the world are concerned, the attitude displayed by active alcoholics and those who quit with out a program, are the best to have. It makes it easier to bend the truth to fit our needs and to disregard our well being for personal gain. As the interesting Mckenna does. All in all, i look very forward to reading Edge of the City and Hyde.	2000-12-31

I found it similar to catcher in the rye in style. I believe there will be more written, as it was ended in 1985. The ambition of the young irishman(mccourt) and his success were interesting. His &quot;keeping it real&quot; with the truths of ginmills,hangovers,lady and family ordeals had a real meaning to those of us who've lived in success and failure. It's a good sequel, but not overwhelming.	2000-12-20

Similar to The simple truth and Total Control..Interesting big operations(CIA, FBI,The Senate). The characters Faith, Thornhill and Buchanon were very interesting. But, the PI Adams stole the show.

I must say I liked it alot.  The character of Brian McKenna is a strong one. The story with the two  killers is very interesting. The Police work is well decribed.The character  Tommy McKenna is based on a real person. He, along with Greve, Bynum, and  Big Ed make the investigation end a real good show. The outside agencies,  FBI, Arizona Sheriffs, and Singapore police add flavor as well. The  Political side show, with Barrone and McMahon, add a good sub-plot. The  story, which had parallels to the movie, 8mm, kept me very interested. This  book will have you feeling bad for the victims. I look forward to more  books by Dan Mahoney.	2000-08-04

The story of Holden Caulfield was interesting. His dealings with guys from Pencey, his teachers, his family, and all the others along the way were great. I liked the relationship he  has with his little sister. I could relate having two younger sisters  myself.

Huston, to me, writes in a way that is a combination of Clancy and Grisham. If you like either one I think you will like this. The  story of Dillon, the Speaker, the President in their Washington setting is  good but it escalates with the addition of the terrorists. Add to that the  battle group led by Admiral Billings and all of his ideas, thoughts and  manpower and you have quite a saga. Dillons side story with his friends and  rivals is also good, as is the battle between attorneys Gray and Pendleton  and you have a winner. But, do you really? As you will see this story will  have you going up,down, and sideways. I read The Price of Power 1st. Try  them both.	2000-07-04

I was expecting more. King describes the forest in a way that you can envision yourself out there with Trisha. The parts of her listening  to her walkman to hear Tom Gordon were interesting. Mr. King does his job  though, as I found myself feeling worried and sorry for her all along. I  did like the ending.	2000-07-03

The story I found to be excellent. The reader, Stephen Lang did an excellent job in his work with the accents of the characters. But mostly his pronunciation  of Materese got my attention. The story of the Materese and the agents of  the CIA, Pryce and Schofield(aka Beowulf Agate) was a good one. My interest  in the series stems from my late grandfathers interest in Mr. Ludlum, and  needless to say my interest has grown. I look forward to more Ludlum in  either book or book on tape. If you like espionage books, try this. I also  recommend books on tape to travelers and others who may not have the time  to read but might be able to fit in the recording. It's very convienient.	2000-07-01

Sean Dillon is a great villan. The book was read by Patrick Macnee and his way is very good. Dillon has alot of ability, and needs it  against the crafty Brosnan. Aroun and Makeev find out early on not to mess  with the former IRA super hitman. Alot of good action sets and if you like  this type of story, pick it up. The version I had is only 2 tapes, but very  good. I wish, though, that it was more. I don't know if it's on tape in an  un-abridged version.	2000-06-29

Jake is a good character, split between his wife and Mrs. Daren, it gets more complicated by his employer. Sage is a good opponent. The Daren family, the  spoiled brat Chip and his sister Gussie add to the plot. If you like  Grisham you'll like this. I recommend it. It's not overpowering, but a  solid 4 star book.	2000-06-24

This was my 1st read in the ongoing saga. Not the way to read Clancy but I saw Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear and Present Danger as movies  so I knew the storyline. Clark and Chavez have come a long way. Action in  this one starts with the initial plane trip to England. If you like stories  of Super elite teams of good guys beating the daylights out of terrorists,  this ones for you. Alot of interesting stuff and some good action.	2000-06-24

Ivey tells of her experiences in a touching way. How her work affected not only her, but, her friends and family. Alot of good stuff. My hats off to all volunteer EMTs  of the world. I'm also going to look for her 1st, EMT.	2000-06-23

Good characters in Sidney,Jason, and Sawyer. If you like Balduccis other work you'll enjoy it. I also think if you like Sandford,  Grisham, or Martini you should try to read it.	2000-06-23

Recently I  read it and thought it was great. I try to read a classic every 5 books or  so. The lives of Scout and Jem are very well put. The trial of Tom  Robinson(a travesty) and the antics of Dill add to it. Atticus is also a  strong character. But the ever elusive Boo Radley steals the show as much  of this great book will show. If you haven't read it in 20 plus years give  it a try.	2000-06-21

Pistone	Books	5	0	0	N	N	if you liked the movie you'll like this	Donnie Brasco is my favorite movie.This book, however, is much more in-depth on the story. Pistone went deeper into the mob than any undercover ever has. Only a hit kept him from being a &quot;made&quot; man. Real stuff  relating to his family(wife and kids) was good. But the story of Brasco and  the mob was well put together and really interesting. Lefty, Sonny Black,  and his other new friends had no idea who he was. If you liked the movie  you'll love this because it's got more details.	2000-06-21

Although I think anyone would find this book entertaining. Good characters by King make it that much better. Edgecombe,Coffey, Wharton, The  warden, the keepers on the mile and the little fellow.  I look forward to  the movie.	2000-06-20

I always had great respect for the man and think he is the best basketball player of all time. This book will let you see in  writing what he did over the years. Well put together by the author and  worthwhile for anyone even those who are not fans.	2000-06-20

I found this well put together. Alot of good musical stuff, the bands history, ups and downs, etc.  But most importantly, the bands transformation to a sober band is remarkable. I am a  person in recovery so i could relate alot to that part of the book. If you  like Aerosmith and want to know more about them, pick this one up.	2000-06-20

While reading thinking of Mitch as Tom Cruise. The book is very good, will hold your attention, and make you want more Grisham. Real good stuff here  with Mitch, the other members of the firm, the mob, the firms security, and  the FBI. I recommend it to all readers of novels.	2000-06-20

I especially liked the one with the little girl that was playing by herself and carded a hole in one, unwitnessed, until the  engineer of a passing train(the course boardered a nearby railway)sent a  well wishing letter to her at the course. This and many others typify real  golf experience to us golfers. If you golf, do yourself a favor and read  this.	2000-06-18

The story of terrorist Adnam is a good one. Along with the shooting down of the Concorde and the other supersonic jet makes this a worthy read.  I recommend it to fans of Clancy and Buchanon.	2000-06-18

The segments with Harms vs. his military foes, Harms and his brother vs. the military foes were great. As were the whole scenario with the Supreme Court and the clerks. The story of John  Fiske, his relationship with his father and brother, got even better with  Sara Evans. I also liked Total Control by Balducci	2000-06-16

Jack is one of my top 2 favorite players, the other being Tiger Woods.  This book tracks Jacks career from kid to Senior Tour. To  look back at it, he was a tremendous player. Tiger has his work cut out to  surpass Jacks career achievements. Good stuff about his family, mentors and  fellow players. A must for Jack fans.	2000-06-15
