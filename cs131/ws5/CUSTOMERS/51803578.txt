How else could he possibly have come to the conclusion that \\"Uncle\\" Milton Berle was a \\"chubby comedian,\\" or that Steve Allen proved to be a \\"stuffy\\" bigot? (The author obviously confuses Allen with Ed Sullivan) Or marvel over the fact that \\"G.I. Blues\\" beat \\"The African Queen\\" at the box-office. (Why shouldn't it have; \\"The African Queen\\" was celebrating its 10-year anniversary in 1961.) And on and on it goes. Never mind that according to author Bret half of Hollywood was gay, including -- hint, hint -- Elvis himself!; that, after all, has become de rigeur for this type of hit-and-run film book.	2004-10-28

For one thing, the dust cover promises far more than the text delivers. Among the actresses profiled, according to the cover flap, are Hope Brown (who? The name doesn't even appear in the index); Ina Claire, who did 2, count 'em, 2 silent feature films and is only fleetingly mentioned on a couple of pages; Asta Nielsen, who is nowhere to be found; Anna Q. Nilsson, who is given but a cursory nod on a single page; and Dorothy Phillips and Alice Terry, both briefly acknowledged on single pages. I had especially been looking forward to author Menefee's take on the long-forgotten Dorothy Phillips. Those actually profiled include Theda Bara, the Gish sisters, The Talmadges, and Maes Marsh and  Murray, most of whom, by stretching it a bit, could be considered early screen stars. But hardly among \\"the first.\\" Janet Gaynor, in contrast, didn't arrive until 1924 and didn't become a star until 1927. Not exactly a screen pioneer. As for the text itself, the profiles are competent but a bit on the dry side, and several of the actresses have recently enjoyed full-scale biographies by, ahem, more enterprising profilers. Strangely, Mr. Menefee fails to list Eve Golden's wonderful \\"Vamp: The Rise and Fall of Theda Bara\\" in his otherwise lengthy bibliography, nor has he apparently been moved by Charles Affron's solid \\"Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life,\\" indispensible sources on two of the profiled actresses. In contrast, I see no pressing need for the present volume, whose conclusions include some airy comparisons between the importance of the lost silent films of Pauline Frederick and the future renown of Meryl Streep's cinematic output -- or some such; Mr. Menefee's point remains a bit unclear, at least to this reader. So instead of the rather superfluous \\"The First Female Stars,\\" I recommend the aforementioned biographies, as well as Jeanine Bassinger's \\"Silent Stars\\" and Anthony Slide's \\"Silent Players,\\" both volumes that actually cover new ground. And, once again, who IS Hope Brown?. And, once again, who IS Hope Brown?	2004-09-22

It is very simple: Anthony Slide's Silent Players will join Kevin Brownlow's The Parade's Gone By as the most quotable work on the silent screen. For the next 50 years or more, scholars and other writers will find themselves forced to begin every other sentence with \\"According to Anthony Slide's Silent Players ....\\" It is that kind of book. It is also one of the more exquisitely produced, beautifully illustrated and splendidly written volumes to come down the pike since, well, since Brownlow's Mary Pickford Rediscovered. That Silent Players is well written will of course come as no surprise to Mr. Slide's core readership but many may well be startled at the book's charming candor. Those of us fortunate enough to consider the author a friend know him to be a first-rate raconteur. But thus far, like a dutiful film scholar, he has avoided injecting himself into a narrative. This time, however, that was not merely unavoidable but necessary. Slide, you see, knew most of his subjects, all of whom with the exception of one luminous lady are now gone. Some he knew more intimately than others and if he didn't have first hand knowledge, he was well acquainted with their nearest and dearest. The subtitle to Silent Players, \\"A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses,\\" is singularly appropriate. As Slide writes in his foreword: \\"With Silent Players I say goodbye to my friends and to a part of my life that has meant so much to me and that can never be repeated.\\" To say that this fine book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone even remotely interested in the silent cinema is redundant. It probably is there already.	2002-10-11

The late George Katchmer of Millersville, PA, was beloved by the readers of Classic Images. And no wonder. For more than a decade Katchmer profiled the stars, villains, heroines, supporting players and even riding extras in silent westerns. Yes, SILENT westerns, a niche in film history covered by hardly anyone at all. Month after month, the reader could find career profiles of everyone from Walter Ackerman to Chief Yowlachie. According to his legion of fans, Katchmer was meticulous to a fault. That, however, remains debatable. In this writer's opinion, George sometimes gave up a wee bit too soon. As the time, to list but one example, when he announced that \\"nothing could be found\\" concerning data on starlet Virginia Lee who, unbeknownst to Katchmer, was still alive and interviewed in the very same issue of Classic Images.  (Blame for this faux pas, however, probably rightfully belongs to the editor of the magazine). Sadly, such caveats reappear in \\"A Biographical Dictionary of Silent Film Western Actors and Actresses,\\" a complete collection of Katchmer's thumb-nail bios through the years. We learn, for example, that 2-reel cowboy star Curley Witzel \\"is a question mark.\\" But in reality, Witzel has been profiled in such magazines as \\"Wrangler's Roost\\" and by this writer ... And, once again, \\"nothing could be found\\" regarding Virginia Lee, who, in fact, was interviewed for a very recent McFarland book, Boyd Magers and Michael Fitzgerald's \\"Ladies of the Western.\\" Why the three stars, then, I hear you ask. Well, because this handsome book comes with literally hundreds of portraits and scene stills of the profiled actors and actresses, making identification so much easier for further research. George Katchmer, his son John and McFarland should be heartily congratulated for including this many wonderful and quite rare illustrations. In fact, George even scared up a remarkable photo of the apparently so elusive Mr. Witzel!	2002-07-05

Wurtzel and the Early Fox Film Corporation: Letters, 1917-1923	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A surprising page-turner	Carla Winter should be highly congratulated for bringing surviving correspondance between her uncle, Hollywood mini-mogul Sol M. Wurtzel, and William Fox to the attention of silent film scholars. And McFarland deserves equal credit for publishing this series of letters, which are entertainingly annotated by (I assume) Wurtzel's late daughter, Lillian Wurtzel Semenov. In his foreword, film historian Scott Eyman expresses the wish that correspondance between the two pertaining to the later 1920s -- when Fox made several classic epics -- also had survived and I obviously agree. But if I absolutely had to chose between the two periods, I would pick the earlier and much less documented years. I actually expected a series of interesting but rather dry discussions of costs, bookings, etc. But &quot;William Fox, Sol M. Wurtzel and the Early Fox Film Corporation&quot; (McFarland's most cumbersome title yet?) is instead a vastly entertaining series of harangues from the penny-pinching Mr. Fox to the sometimes defenseless but at other times crafty Mr. Wurtzel. As the author of the annotations so correctly states at one point, it is no wonder that poor Sol Wurtzel spent his life afflicted with troublesome digestion and various facial tics. Anyone remotely interested in silent film ought to read this volume of letters which, amazingly enough, becomes a true page-turner where, as Harry Ritz reportedly once said, things tend to go &quot;from bad to Wurtzel.&quot;	2001-06-23

To my great surprise, I truly enjoyed it instead. Cramming a somewhat slim volume with facts of all the selected \\"babies\\" - from Joan Crawford to Maryon Aye - Liebman seems to have left no stone unturned. Naturally, you will not learn everything you want to know about, say, Clara Bow or Ginger Rogers, but The Wampas Baby Stars is a very handy first step. And you will not find fact and filmographies of Helen Cohan or Flora Bramley anywhere else. As an added threat, Mr. Liebman also discusses the wannabe Wampas selections of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. All highly entertaining and well illustrated.	2001-01-16

In fact,  B Western Actors Encyclopedia doesn't seem to have been researched at all.  And not only that, author Holland could hardly have used the volumes he  quotes in his bibliography and still have managed to misspell the names of  important genre director Spencer Gordon Bennet and popular heroine Lucile  Browne. (The latter, almost needless to say, becomes Lucille Brown).  Nitpicking? I don't think so. This, after all, is a volume that calls  itself an encyclopedia. As a matter of fact, most fans of the genre will  find themselves in the unusual situation of knowing more about the subject  matter than the author. Someone once published a book debunking a recent  biography of Errol Flynn. To compile a list of errors and omissions in B  WESTERN ACTORS ENCYCLOPEDIA would probably prove just as exhausting. My one  star is for McFarland's handsome design and several quite wonderful stills.	2000-07-26

That supposedly shocking &quot;expos&eacute;&quot; was apparently mainly the work of a ghost-writer who  spiced it up to bolster sales. &quot;Wife of the Life of the Party,&quot;  on the other hand, is advertized as a much more balanced view of the lady's  stormy, if brief, marriage to Chaplin. It may be; I haven't read the 1966  book. But Lita still presents herself as innocence incarnate and Charlie as  an unfeeeling cad and a debaucher. The truth, I suspect, lies somewhere in  between. The big question, however, remains: Does it matter anymore?  Chaplin's work speaks for itself. Obviously, the writing of the book was a  cartharsis for an elderly woman, who, sadly, passed away shortly before it  was published. My two stars are for Miss Chaplin's interesting account of  the making of THE KID and for co-author Jeffrey Vance's copious and  informative notes and wrap-around.	2000-06-01

Books with show business interviews are usually a waste of time in my opinion. But &quot;Actors on Red Alert&quot; by noted film historian Anthony Slide arrives as a welcome exception, not only due to the obvious  intelligence and forthrightness of the five subjects but also because of  Mr. Slide's perceptive questioning. All five -- Phil Brown, Rose Hobart,  Marsha Hunt, Marc Lawrence and Doris Nolan -- were to various degrees  affected by the notorious Hollywood witch hunt of the late 1940s. One --  Lawrence -- became an informer, in fact, and &quot;named names,&quot; a  treachery the man apparently has a tough time dealing with to this very  day. Surprisingly, Lawrence blames the blacklist not on the rightwing  politicians of the day but on the Communist Party itself! The remaining  four interview subjects -- two of whom were longtime close friends of Mr.  Slide -- offer a more balanced view of the tragedy. None, however, is  boring and neither is Mr. Slide's wonderful book. In fact, all too little  have been written about Doris Nolan, an actress rather better known for her  stage work than her few film appearances. But Miss Nolan proves perhaps the  most interesting subject for Mr. Slide's probing questions. Sadly, the  actress passed away prior to the publishing of &quot;Actors on Red  Alert,&quot; and the book shall stand as a testament to an unjustly  forgotten personality.	2000-05-30

The result is one of the most engaging memoirs to have come down the pike in quite a  while. Robert Clarke is almost too self-effacing; he is much better  remembered than he thinks. Clarke was never a major star (not even close)  but a true-blue working Hollywood actor -- and one with a keen sense of  observation. Unforgettable as the dog boy in Val Lewton's Bedlam, Clarke  went on to appear in Tim Holt Westerns, played supporting roles (some mere  walk-ons) in more prestigious fare and starred in very early television  swashbucklers. Never boring the reader with endless obscure personal  details (Clarke, lone among Hollywood survivors apparently, doesn't seem to  have had a horrible childhood), the author recounts working for  next-to-nothing in no-budget B-movies, for Ida Lupino and Jack &quot;just  the facts, ma'm&quot; Webb. and others too numerous to mention. He even  produced and directed a couple of 1950s sci-fi flicks. All of this is  recounted in engaging fashion and devoid of fake sentimentality. Robert  Clarke is probably not well-known enough to have been published by Random  House -- but that is their loss. Happily, horror specialist Tom Weaver  brought him to Gary and Susan Svehla's Midnight Marquee, one of these  technically up-to-par genre publishing houses made possible by new  technology. It is due to folks like Weaver and the Svehlas that film books  make such delightful reading these days.	2000-05-06

Breen took his seat as the  head of the Production Code Administration and made movies predictable.  From Mae West to Paul Robeson, PRE-CODE HOLLYWOOD, as Mr. Doherty so ably  demonstrates, offers so much more than primitive sound recording and future  movie legends in their embryonic, all-but-forgotten years.	2000-03-25

Miss Orrison went about interviewing surviving  crew and cast members, each of whom offer a different point of view of  film-making in the last days of the old Hollywood studio system. The book  is filled with surprising and amazing tidbits -- Shirley Booth (Hazel) was  actually up for a role later essayed by Yvonne de Carlo! -- but is most  importantly a warm and insightful look at the man who had been there from  the beginning -- if not during the Exodus then certainly when Hollywood was  little more than an orange grove. The book's most surprising revelation (at  least to me) is that William Boyd was actually DeMille's first choice to  play Moses!

With that said, Bold! Daring! is probably the most important book on the American screen published in recent times. The author  eminently explains not only how exploitation movies, the step children of  the Golden Era film industry, came to be but, more importantly, why. Using  a liberal dose of both contemporary and modern sources, Schaefer eminently  describes the rise and fall and rise again of a genre not as easily  dismissed as previous works would have us believe. BOLD! DARING! SHOCKING!  TRUE quite simply fills an important gap in our knowledge of society in  general and the film industry (with stress on INDUSTRY) in particular.

On the  other hand, one is tempted to question the inclusion in a book sub-titled  &quot;Bad Girls of Film&quot; the likes of goody-two-shoes Jeanne Crain and  even the aforementioned Dorothy Hart. In her necessary selection, Miss  Hansberry included actresses who, granted, appeared in film noir but but  whose roles were not noir at all.

The incredible Billy Doyle has published a followup to his now legendary &quot;Ultimate Directory of the Silent Screen Performer.&quot; This time, Doyle covers births and deaths for over 9,000 behind-the-scenes personnel,  both silent and sound and not only the obvious -- directors, producers,  screenwriters -- but hair dressers, art directors, cinematographers,  editors, etc., etc. As everyone familiar with Mr. Doyle's tireless approach  knows, the directory is as &quot;ultimate&quot; as humanly possible. In his  foreword, Doyle modestly allows that the book is incomplete -- many film  workers died in complete obscurity and have thus proven impossible to trace  -- offering the fervent hope that &quot;some future film historian can  accomplish [a complete directory].&quot; Some may try but the film history  community will owe Mr. Doyle its gratitude for a great many years to come.	1999-08-03

The reason is the  quality of the writing, which is always objective and never boring. Good  work, folks!	1999-07-27

The authors have  for some reason bought into the era's flowery press agentry and their  Balboa Amusement Producing Company is on several pages compared to the  later M-G-M in importance. Still and all, any book on the early film  industry -- especially local film-making away from Hollywood -- is greatly  appreciated. Despite its flaws, &quot;Balboa Films&quot; is recommended  reading.	1999-07-25

The book is the perfect companion piece to Randy Skretvedt's  invaluable &quot;Laurel and Hardy; the Magic Behind the Movies.&quot;	1999-07-18

Eckhardt should be congratulated for this wonderful biography of pioneering film-maker Siegmund Lubin. I had assumed the book to be interesting, if probably a bit technical, and was not prepared for how  entertaining the text would be. Using humor, understanding and affection  for his subject, Eckhardt describes Lubin's rise from poor immigrant to  King of the Movies; his battles with Thomas Edison; the creating of  Lubinville, the producer's plant in Philadelphia, and, later, the move to  suburban Betzwood. The benevolent mogul had enough chutzpah for two  Goldwyns, it appears, and although he might not have paid his actors the  salaries they could claim elsewhere, many nevertheless chose to stay in the  congenial atmosphere of Lubinville. Like all the other pioneers, Lubin's  era was over by the late 1910s, but until then, the German immigrant had  entertained millions with his little &quot;fillums.&quot; &quot;The King of  the Movies&quot; is of course not only a biography of Siegmund Lubin  himself, but an invaluable insight into the Lubin Mfg. Co., arguably the  until now least understood of the early film companies.	1999-04-24

Veteran film historian Buck Rainey should be heartily commended for this long-awaited book, which, for the first time, lists all serials (and most of the related series) in one volume. Liberally sprinkled with  illustrations, this handsome and well-researched volume ought to be  mandatory reading for film scholars everywhere! And thank you, Mr. Rainey,  for providing a detailed index and an extensive bibliography.	1999-04-09
