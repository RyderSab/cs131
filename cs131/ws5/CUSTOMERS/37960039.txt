Her elevated language can be so cerebral that the nether regions disengage. I found that true in this anthology at times - but that doesn't mean that it, like Anais Nin, isn't worth exploring and savoring.<br /><br />There are four novellas in this anthology, each a very different take on some aspect of fairy tales. There's good laughs (a few of the belly variety) and good sex. A few tears, some sweet sentiment and some pokes at the nature of feminine roles in such archetypal stories. I think that each author sat down to write something sexy and fun, but being all good writers they couldn't help but throw in a little more. Defniitely a couple of times I forgot I was turned on as phrases or ideas struck me as beautiful and thought-provoking.<br /><br />I read the four stories some time apart so as not to overdose on the fairy tale theme. Karin Kallmaker left me haunted, while Therese Szymanski and Julia Watts ranged from funny to hilarious. Barbara Johnson slipped a cute twist into her story and they all had lots of all female action, including the seven lusty wenches. The bedroom (or forest thicket, tower bower, mermaid's grotto etc.) action had a wide range from vanilla to earthy, something for everyone in the vast middle of the lesbian sex spectrum. No extreme kink, but no fading to black when the going gets rough either.<br /><br />The four stories were all satisfying in their own way and as a whole, the anthology will stand the test of time, I think. I am eagerly awaiting the next quartet effort which I'm sure will have the same excellent writing, humor and heat that this one did.	2005-07-25

After a disastrous marriage she's sworn off men. To cure her bruised heart, she embarks on a whirlwind tour of Europe. She's oblivious to the fact that Alison, her agent, has been lusting after her for years. But then she meets Nick Frost and all the elements of the perfect paperback romance take a decided dyke-left turn.  <br /> <br />I loved how Kallmaker takes all the conventions of straight romance and converts it to what works for lesbians. The satire is witty without being mean. I don't mean to make this lovely tale of identity, gender, coming out and claiming love to be more than it is. It's simply wonderful, satisfying and moving.  <br /> <br />Not to mention funny. Another tour de force from the Queen. <br />	2005-05-31
US	37960039	R1MWSZTA2IB2KD	1933110058	412369844	Fated Love	Books	5	8	10	N	N	A Delicious Serving of Romance, "Straight" Up	I am a big fan of Rad and \\"Fated Love\\" is one her best romances. Uber is absent, and that was welcome to me. The characters of Quinn and Honor are therefore built from the ground up and seemed fresh and new. They both have secrets but neither is \\"tortured and dark.\\"  <br /> <br />What keeps a writer's work in lesbian romance fresh, to me, is one of two things. Either she plays with the basic formula or she does the basic formula *really well.* To me, Radclyffe has done the basic formula *really well* in \\"Fated Love.\\" So I'm puzzled by reviews that suggest this book \\"breaks\\" the romance formula. How so? <br /> <br />Two women meet, are undeniably attracted, but separated by a variety of factors. Over time they learn to respect, then to admire and like, and finally to admit to love. Together, they overcome the things that separate them. This journey is where all the fun is. This is the \\"straight up\\" romance plot of 80% of the lesbian romance books produced. The difference between novels is the writer's talent (Rad's is undeniable!) in breathing life into the story so that the reader experiences this familiar tale in a brand new way. <br /> <br />\\"Fated Love\\" follows this precise, tried-and-true journey. It does so consistently, with zest and eroticism, in an exciting, fast-paced setting. As with \\"Love's Tender Warriors\\" (same basic outline) Radclyffe knows how to form, stir up and satisfy our expectations. Her erotic scenes are powerful and realistic. <br /> <br />If anything, I liked \\"Fated Love\\" more than Warriors because the issues that separated Honor and Quinn were the kinds of things I, or any friend of mine, could be dealing with. Family concerns and health, career and outright terror to find yourself falling in love. They are Rad's usual strong-willed and extremely talented women, but both are fragile for different, realistic reasons. They are super women, but not superwomen. <br /> <br />There are so many novels out there that follow this formula and do it with tired, mechanical, uninspired, forgettable stories that use the basic formula in the most mediocre way. (There are a few writers who seem to do little more than search-and-replace to change the character and place names before they call it a brand new book!) Only a few can do the beloved, familiar romance formula again and again and each time tell a story that is fresh and entertaining. So perhaps that's why some feel \\"Fated Love\\" is not a formula romance -- where Rad has broken the rules is in doing the formula *really well.*  <br /> <br />This *is* a formula romance for lesbians, and it's one of the really good ones. Good characters, exciting storytelling, excellent craftwomanship, hot sex and a truly believable conclusion. It's about as \\"straight\\" up as a lesbian romance can be! <br /> <br />	2004-12-29
US	37960039	R3RL9LHMJQL5T8	1594930015	318102889	Sugar	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Sweet from Start to Finish	Like jam on toast done golden and crisp, this latest romantic tale from Karin Kallmaker was just right for me. I'd recommend it to any fan and certainly to anyone (if there *is* anyone who hasn't yet experienced her light, pleasing romantic touch) who likes a good read. <br /> <br />Like all of her novels, she avoids the formula even though in the purest dilution of the plot it reads like a classic formula. The reason it's not is that lesbian romances (unlike het ones) most often open with the presentation of two characters we know will get together before the last page. The pleasure is in reading how. Kallmaker )like Radclyffe, another favorite of mine) can take that simple outline and do wonderfully different things with it. In Substitute for Love, for example, Holly and Reyna don't actually meet until at least 3/4s of the way into the book, yet their collision course is clear from page 1. In Embrace in Motion, Sarah chooses Ms. Wrong for the first part of the book, then comes to realize Ms. Right has been under her nose all along. <br /> <br />In \\"Sugar,\\" Kallmaker twists the usual lesbian romance beginning of two primary characters by giving us Sugar and three potential suitors for her affections. All three are charming, sexy, persuasive and very interested in Sugar. But only one will earn her love. Along the way Sugar -- like you and me and all the women we know -- has crud to cope with, a business to run, life to handle.  <br /> <br />I loved the journey with Sugar, all the way. I loved her confusion when she felt real lust for a woman she wasn't yet sure she could like as a friend. The puzzlement of feeling affinity with someone but the lack of that spark that would create that first kiss. And finding herself feeling lust *and* affinity and then being completely tongue-tied and scared to make the first move -- and so is the woman who is trying awfully hard to say I love you but doesn't quite know how. These are women still forming, strong in their own sense of self but not yet deft at dealing with their own emotions. It made me full of wonder that at any point any of us ever figure out how love works. The romantic sentiments in this book are charming, all the way through. <br /> <br />If that story weren't enough, the plotline with Sugar and her grandmother is vintage Kallmmker and yet brand new. She set up Sugar's dread of living with the raving bible-thumping homophobe so I was dreading it just as much and then pulled the carpet out from under my expectations and own presumptions as she so often does. I scraped my jaw up off the floor at about the same time Sugar did. Sugar's three older (and bossy) sisters are delightfully drawn, as is her fascinating ex and still friend, Noor. I'd love to see a short story about Noor and her gf in a \\"Frosting on the Cake 2.\\"  <br /> <br />Which is the whole reason I'm writing this review -- how about it, Miz K? Can we have some more Frosting? I really want to know so many things! Did Shea and Anthea have their baby? Is Sydney President yet? And c'mon, Holly and Reyna need more story! More Frosting? Please??? <br /> <br />I'll quit begging and end by saying that while Sugar herself is indecisive and founders a bit in trying to decide what love is and isn't, when it comes to what's right for her family, doing the right thing, she doesn't hesitate. She's a complicated young woman, getting by the best she knows how and I would be *proud* to be her big sister.  <br /> <br />Thank you once again, Miz K, for a great read, worth every penny and every minute. Like all the others, I know I'll read it more than once. <br />	2004-12-28

I've known all along that Kalmaker can write steamy hot love scenes in her romances and some of her recent short stories have gotten really racy without losing her romantic touch. I didn't know what to expect from this romance, which is touted as a \\"full-length erotic novel.\\" Lots of hot scenes but less of the woman-to-woman emotional bonding that I love about her work?     Kallmaker did both! The evolving love story between Brandy and Tess is incredibly sweet, emotionally honest and fraught with the pitfalls of communication. Both young women are well-versed in saying what they like in bed (and brace yourself because *nothing* is left unsaid!), but neither have a clue how to say what they want in *life*. Along the way, they figure it out.     Meanwhile, through artful flashbacks of the first time Brandy and Tess got together (just friends!) interlaced with current encounters the plot provides some of the steamiest reading I've found in a long time. I had to make myself stop reading the first night because I wanted to make it last a really long time. This is definitely grownup bedtime after dark reading! If you don't care for hot, explicit lesbian sex, then don't read this book. Don't say you weren't warned!    A lot of erotica leaves me cold because the people don't seem to have any emotional connection. This book was red hot emotionally and that's why, for me, the sex was red hot too. More, I want more! So does my girlfriend, who said this book was definitely one she enjoyed both while reading it and after.	2004-10-12

Some books set in the past read like history lessons and are just about as dry and dull, too. But not this one. Instead of lots of emphasis on events and who did what, this novel is like a history lesson in the emotions of a burgeoning lesbian-feminist. I take for granted a lot not just how far we've come as lesbians, but also as women. Jessica is the kind of woman who thought of stuff to teach women about work and success that we all take for granted now.<br />But that's all secondary to a nice, romantic plot about two women who fall in love and have to figure out how to show it. It's 1978, you're in love with another woman -- do you propose? There's no gay marriage, there aren't even commitment ceremonies. I liked reading about women who had to think about that stuff because nobody had been doing what they wanted to do, which is start a life obviously together.<br />I had never read this early book of Kallmaker's because it was set in the past, but after reading the short story based on these characters in Frosting on the Cake I started to look for it and it was out of print. Now it's back in print and I'm glad! Every gay person should know who Harvey Milk was. Not as a name on a page but how this book let me see him: as a dream of what our future could be, and the hope that he gave two women (and the rest of us) that there would be a better future for gay people.<br />Considering all that this little romance accomplishes, it's no surprise to me that Kallmaker many years later wrote Substitute for Love, which looks again at the political reality of many gay people. I swear, if the L-Word had this woman writing for them I might start believing their plots!	2004-04-16

I've found in a lot of these \\"best of\\" erotica anthologies that the sex is bizarre and the people even more so. But maybe that's me. They never seem to be the kind of lesbian I am, with a taste for a touch of kink, but a larger hunger for emotional connection.<br />What I know is that when a book says it's erotic it needs to turn me on and this amazing, thoughtful, well-written collection did just that. Over and over.<br />Standout stories: the opening with Karin Kallmaker's \\"Butch Across the Hall\\" (other contribution \\"Curve of Her\\" is more tame but still a major wow!), M. Christian's \\"Coming Out of Left Field,\\" D.L. White's \\"Pandora's Box\\" (screaming heat!), and Elizabeth Dunn's \\"requiem\\" (which ends the book with a powerful vision of how the worst nightmare can open the door to what really matters). I could list nearly every story in the book and just say \\"hot!\\" because they are. The only story that gave me trouble was \\"Three to Tango\\" which was written in a tag team kind of style, and seemed to jerk from person to person. <br />I notice that the publisher, Bella After Dark, is new, but sign me up for every book they produce. If they stay this good I might be able to survive being single.	2004-03-05

The women are strong but vulnerable, valiant but not invincible. But you'll never guess -- the tall, dark, tortured surgeon has a *past* that makes it difficult for her to *love.* The earnest newcomer is *puzzled* by the reticence of the woman she's falling in love with. It *confuses* her and causes her to cry sometimes. Can anyone spell F-O-R-M-U-L-A?<br />The characters are well-drawn and the setting very well done, but the PLOT has been done -- by Radclyffe especially -- many times now, and that really interferes with my enjoyment of the story. I am a big Rad fan, but she needs to take pages from Karin Kallmaker's books -- no two sets of heroines are the same, and the reasons the get together or stay apart are unique to every story. They're never cookie cutter and I know Rad has different stories in her. <br />Sorry to be a downer about this book. If it's your first Rad you'll love it.

She lives in a place where every 4th woman is a lesbian and yet NOBODY -- including her -- seems to have ever thought \\"hmmm, maybe she's gay.\\" It just isn't possible in S.F. to live in a separate straight world and go through life untouched by gay people. They're everywhere! <br />This would have played better in Dubuque or Peoria or upstate New York. As a tale of The City, it only makes sense if it's 1955. <br />Writing is okay --it's a first novel.

Having just finished yet another formula romance where some traumatic past event keeps two women from accepting that they're in love for 249 pages (but they figure it out on page 250, end of story) I was feeling pretty jaded as I started One Degree of Separation.<br />I don't know how Karin Kallmaker does it! Fifteen romances and she nevers writes the same story twice. On the first page -- the first paragraph! -- she made me laugh. Then I laughed some more. Then, when Liddy Peel walks into the story in Chapter 2 I was on the floor. <br />Not that either character has to quip a joke every sentence. Nor is their humor based on belitting others as less cool than they are. (I hate that about some romances whose entire humor rests on making fun of other people.) It's their wry outlook on their *own* life that got the first giggle and from there I was completely hooked.<br />It has to be good writing for me to enthusiastically believe a rather improbable turn of events in a small town. And not only do I buy every bit of the plot, Kallmaker's erotic touch is so compelling that when Marian and Liddy look at each other the first time I positively *felt* the rush. <br />Marian and Liddy's courtship is set against the backdrop of a cast of well-defined secondary characters who swill coffee and drop amusing wisdom about such topics as what constitutes hot talk in bed, and if it's okay to date the ex of an ex. Marian, meanwhile, is trying to stay in control of her life, but Inner Slut and Inner Prude refuse to get along. Sophisticated, big-city girl Liddy knows she herself is still suffering angry depression from her last relationship, but swear to freakin' god, how can a librarian in Iowa freakin' City be so sexy? And such a great kisser? It's not fair!<br />When it became clear that both women had something in their past that still hurt and made it hard for them to trust that happiness could be real this time, I believed that too and it's the way Kalmmaker tells the story thatmakes it possible. And when Marian arrives on Liddy's doorstep in the middle of a rainstorm  the night that follows is one of Kallmaker's hottest ever.<br />Taking place over just four days of sizzling Iowa summer, One Degree of Separation is the best lighthearted romance I've read in a long time. I am in awe of Kallmaker's range. Her latest before this, Maybe Next Time, spanned 40 years of the heroine's life, and was one of the most intense, wrenching romances I've ever read. Then Kallmaker turns around and delivers this amusing but never vicious, heartfelt but never sappy, steamy, engaging story of two ordinary, every day women who make you believe in the extraordinary power of love.<br />Once again, I ended a Karin Kallmaker romance absolutely certain that some day that kind of magic can happen to me.	2004-01-27

US	37960039	R1UXXDK1850WWD	1410730883	112448948	Around We Go Some More	Books	1	6	7	N	N	Read the blurb about the book	It's right up above ... read it.<br />If you can read that and not pause one, two, three or more times to correct the grammar, wonder who &quot;her&quot; refers to in at least two places where you can't tell, and want to rewrite several sentences then you *might* be able to read this book.<br />I couldn't. Every page had me itching for a red pencil. The excuse that it's the writer's 'style' doesn't fly. As a 'style' it comes under the label of 'ignorant of basic grammar.' An editor could work for a week on this book and still be on chapter 1.  <br />There's plot here, but it is so hard to find under the bad writing that I couldn't follow it. What I could tell was that what seemed a promising romantic story has turned into pure soap opera -- people who are good today are evil tomorrow to just keep the drama high and the satisfaction low.	2003-09-26
US	37960039	RMB5ZB8A5NOU4	1931513260	700493592	Maybe Next Time	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Get Over Wanting it Easy!	If you want an easy read, a quick romance and lots of bedroom time don't read this book. But if you do read this book then read what Karin Kallmaker actually wrote -- not what you wish she'd written because you felt like having the same-old-same-old today. It's like wanting your fix of vanilla ice cream, ordering spumoni and then complaining. <br />If Maybe Next Time was a PBS documentary or an indie movie (and it ought to be!) I don't think anyone would whine that Bree's story wasn't &quot;good.&quot; The jacket copy is a BIG clue this is not your typical romance! Among other things, this is a story of &quot;personal tragedy.&quot;<br />I found it absolutely uplifting, touching, wrenching, heartbreaking. I cried and at the end was *very* relieved and happy for Bree. Her music was a curse and when it was lifted she had to start over and she made some really bad mistakes (oh and thank you whoever you are who gave away a KEY element of the plot -- that's nice for those who haven't read it yet!) and she finds the power to atone, to change. <br />As for Bree being unlikeable and immature -- whatever. I think anyone who is thrust into the performing world at a young age won't be mature in some ways, and yet unbelievably controlled and mature in others. Reeling from the betrayal of a lover, Bree pulls herself together to give a critical performance at an audition. How many of us more &quot;likeable&quot; people could conquer our anger and hurt that well?<br />I have followed Karin Kallmaker's writing since In Every Port and I see her FINALLY breaking out of the old Naiad cookie cutter. I am stunned with every new book. Maybe Next Time was powerful, well-written, complicated and deeply absorbing. Is it her best romance? Maybe not. Is it the best thing she's ever written -- yep. I would definitely say it is. If you don't read this book because it's not the typical 200-page girl-meets-girl, misunderstandings and hot sex, and live happily ever after story then you're missingout. There's nothing wrong with that kind of book, but there's more to life than vanilla ice cream. And this book is simply no comparison to a lot of 400-page potboilers where the lesbians aren't even sexual. Please. I thought we were past the era of fading to black when it comes to the part where the characters do the things that make them lesbian. Bree is sexual; she likes women. It's a big part of her story, the how, who and why she has sex. Those scenes are just plain hot.<br />Personally, I think Karin Kallmaker writes the feel-good kind of romance better than anyone, and I'm sure she will again and I'll enjoy it. But I hope because those less interested in good literature are whining about her having the audacity to write something that makes them stretch doesn't make her stop. I want our community to have this incredible writer who conveys a *realistic* range of lesbian experience. I'll take *anything* she writes over some of the unrealistic drivel getting vanity published these days, and most of the highly-lauded &quot;novels&quot; out there. I just finished a &quot;must read&quot; *serious* work where I was supposed to identify with a cross-dressing drug-addicted bicycle messenger. The book was good but give me Kallmaker's universally appealing characters any day. I have been shoved off my preferred paths in life along the way by tragedy, misfortune and pain, and if that's true of you then I don't see how you wouldn't find Bree's struggles totally absorbing. <br />I think I'll add that if you want to show that you read something closely and have a considered opinion to offer you might want to spell the author's name correctly. That would be Kar*I*n, not Karen. Plus, it's Dian*A* not Diane. Also, if you want to read a sample, visit her web site and you'll see what you're getting. <br />Read it, let it be what it is, and you won't regret a moment. Books like Maybe Next Time don't come around that often. Please keep writing them, Ms. Kallmaker, because some ofus *do* get it.	2003-09-26

But it will make you chuckle, sigh and relax. It's a great escape beach book and I think there's a place in life for reads like this! There are lots of times I don't want a gut-wrenching emotional read that I dwell on for days after (I still can't get scenes from Karin Kallmaker's Maybe Next Time out of my head and it's been two weeks now) and Peggy Herring can really soothe and let me just enjoy. Trina's family are absolutely rotten to her because she's gay, and Trina's way of handling it is a lesson in wit and tenacity!	2003-09-26

Not that they are ordinary, but they're *real.* <br />But like others of her books, there is just one note in the core relationship: Drew and Sean are drawn to each other immediately and only one thing separates them. It takes 250 pages to work through the one issue. It's realistically handled but if it weren't for a side plot with Sean's sister, this novel would have been 100 pages. In many ways, the side plot drove the action, not the main plot. Also, while Drew and Sean seem very real, there are a few characters who are just too wise, too calm, too good to be true. <br />It's a small quibble because basically this is an enjoyable solid romance easily worth the time and money. The sex scenes are warming, the dialogue engaging. I totally agree with another reviewer who says this is the work of a professional.	2003-09-26

It's not a matter of getting what you pay for, though, because it's more expensive than the books from publishers who do editing (Bella Books, Naiad, Alyson, Spinsters Ink, Rising Tide and so on). In the case of this book, though, the author was good enough and careful enough that it was worth not just the money, but the investment of time to read it. I haven't been able to say that about some of the self-published books I've read lately!	2003-02-19

All the threads from Sleight of Hand are picked up, a few more are added and now I can't wait until book 3!<br />This weekend I'm going to reread Sleight of Hand, and then read this again to savor.

I read it about a year ago and was really lukewarm toward it. Parts were exciting but it didn't work as a whole. I can't believe it ended up getting some award nominations; there are some holes you can drive a truck through. Plus I didn't see how the Egyptian timeline meshed at all with the Salem one. I felt like this was a nice try, but as someone else says, others have done this plot better. I would recommend Laura Adams' Christabel (a romance not a mystery), which does the timeline thing really well.	2002-08-28

One of my favorite scenes is where Faith and Sydney are walking in a field. When I read it I thought of Sting's Fields of Gold. Later I learned that the author had been deliberately trying to invoke the feeling of that song without actually referring to it -- did she ever succeed!<br />The passion, too, is astonishingly erotic, explosively conveyed and exquisitely detailed. Give me that over the two or three sentences I'm reading in a lot of uber books these days. <br />Most of all, I love that both these women are smart, and it shows in all they do. They're moral and compassionate and the kind of women I really hope do exist. Sydney or someone just like her *does* need to be in government!	2002-04-09

Brett is a hard woman trying not to get hurt in a world that has knocked her around. She wants to play the field but has fallen in love. More than the mystery I like Brett's dilemma and how realistically she is pulled between her overt butch sexuality and her love for one woman. I can't wait to find out how Brett continues to walk that line.	2002-04-04

More voices being heard than ever is a good thing. The only drawback is amateurish or just plain weak books that get no editing. Good writer, good book. Bad or inexperienced writer results in a weak and amateurish book. There's no way to tell with some of these publishers which is which without buying the book.<br />When it comes to the on-demand publishers I now wait to get a good recommendation before I plunk down my cash. The established publishers, like Bella Books, Alyson, and Naiad, are far less risky; without exception -- whether you like the theme or the writing -- they turn out consistent books.<br />This book is an example of a professionally written and edited story and I just can't describe how much better it is than some of the on-demand stuff which I often give 1 or 2 stars. The author, editor and publisher all care about the final product meeting a minimum standard. <br />Room for Love was a thoroughly enjoyable book and a treat to read. I've taken note of the publisher: Bella Books. Since they also published two other fine novels that I've read (Mirrors and Sleight of Hand) I'll be looking for more from Bella Books. Not only do their writers have talent, the press itself seems to know how to produce a consistently good product that is well worth my money and time.	2002-03-21

As sweet as the plot is, the writing is amateurish.  I just don't think it's all that well-written. It's nowhere near as good as Frankie Jones, Marianne Martin or Karin Kallmaker. Those women know how to craft good sentences, good paragraphs, well-directed chapters and overall intriguing plots. I' d have to know that McCann had actually gotten better (and there's some good advice from Litterati1 that she should heed) before I bought her next book.	2002-03-20

This is a novella, a one-issue story without any real depth. Even so, shortness is no reason to have shallow characters (a 3-page short story can present a fully-realized, engaging character) and these two women were shallow. They had no complexity at all in their thought processes beyond \\"She's beautiful! Oh, I'm in love!\\" <br />I didn't want to know them and most romance novels make me yearn to meet the characters. I wouldn't recommend this at all. If you like shorter reads with more emotional depth, I'd recommend Peggy Herring.	2002-03-20

They're strong, their mature and they have their stuff to deal with. They're ambitious but real, passionate but practical. They way they find each other and finally come together is something I wish were real because I so wanted them to exist and their relationship to be real. I guess for a real-life love affair I'll have to continue to admire the author's 25 years with her partner, and take that as my proof that it can happen!	2002-03-14
