The state has been my home for ten years.  I am not sure I would have appreciated the book, had I read it much earlier.  One has to live in Idaho and become minimally aware of some history and have visited some places in the state.  Then reading the book brings a sense of rewarding surprise as the reader realizes there is more to what he has known and seen.  Many of the descriptions of events in the book begin in a very ordinary way and then build to connect to something important.  The author uses this device to tell about the Frank Church wilderness area.  It all begins with the Forest Service rangers trying to solve the problem of washing their clothing without using electricity or gasoline to power a washing machine.  If there is one thing I would have wanted in the book, it would be small maps with the outline of the state and a black dot placed to indicate where exactly each event happened.  It is said Idaho is a state separated by geography and distance.  It is easy to live in one part of the state without becoming familiar with other parts of the state.  This book would make a good gift for a number of occasions.  Even people living outside of Idaho could enjoy it.	2005-10-04

They thought it would provide me insights for preaching that also benefit them as hearers of the sermons.  I used it by means of the index volume for many years.  Finally, I decided to read all nine text volumes cover-to-cover.  It took me six years to finish, but I found things  I did not find through the index and would never have known to seek.  At times articles in Kittel can numb the mind with boredom.  At other times they can cause it to soar with new insights based in an array of factual information.  The reader will probably not agree with everything.  Certainly, individual contributors of the articles do not always agree with one another.  Still, I would not be without Kittel.  My copy is drenched in ink from underlinings and notes I have made as I read it.  I know it would be tempting to buy the one volume \\"baby Kittel\\" and skip the extra expense of the larger set, but there are key pieces of information that did not make it into the editors' view of what should be included in the one volume edition. Spend the money and get the real thing. There have been some tremendous discount specials that make the whole set little more than the list price of the \\"baby\\" version.	2005-10-02

Students of Franzmann always appreciated his masterful insight into the New Testament text.  Roehrs does a very good job, too.

Liberals (like Ted Kennedy, Patrick Leahy, Christopher Dodd, and other newly minted leaders from the left) constantly parade before the cameras to give their impassioned pleas to defeat this or that right-wing measure and save America from the extremists.  The only trouble is that the liberals have been wrong every time and for decades.  They never learn from the past, either, and they are right back to do it all over again.

The first is that of Mark Hofmann, who made a regular habit of 'unearthing' long-missing documents from early Mormon history.  He is the same Mark Hofmann, who as a boy showed a friend how he could make an ordinary silver dime into a rare coin by changing the mint mark with his home electroplating setup.  There is enough suspense in the Hofmann subplot to make this book well worth reading. <br /> <br />But, the Hofmann portion of the story could never have happened were it not for persistent fear of the Mormon Church leadership that early Mormon historical documents could discredit the Church in the eyes of the faithful if they were to be found and made public.  Hofmann played on this fear by claiming to have located various documents and offering them to the Church leadership at huge sums before someone hostile to the Church might acquire them and publish their contents.  The Church leadership sought to get the documents by arranging their purchase through third parties who would then donate them to the Church so that the Church could plausibly deny it possessed the documents.  These documents would then be placed into The Vault where they would never again see the light of day.   <br /> <br />If this sounds like too much conspiracy theory to spin, the reader should wait until he or she gets to the portion of the book dealing with the investigation and trial of Mark Hofmann.  Evidence that Hofmann had killed two people was overwhelming, but the entire legal system began rapidly to lose interest in prosecuting him when it became known that the Mormon Church wanted no part of the publicity that would be generated by all ofthe disclosures coming out in a trial.  Gordon B. Hinckley, then not yet the head of the Mormon Church, simply told the lead detective he was not interested in testifying about his involvement in purchasing documents from Mark Hofmann, and he eventually got away with it!  As intriguing as Mark Hofmann's tortured plots are, the glimpses into the Mormon Church and its influence over the media and the legal system in Salt Lake City are equally fascinating.	2005-07-28

It has more than enough features with cross references, study notes, text notes, introductions to books of the Bible, tables and charts, an index of the study notes, and a concordance.  I was disappointed that the study notes do not make a connection between the Tower of Babel (confusion of languages) and Pentecost (the bridging of languages).  The Oxford Annotated makes the connection.  The notes on Ephesians 4:9 assume \\"lower parts of the earth\\" refers to the incarnation when Kittel's TDNT presents a good case for understanding this phrase as hell as per ancient Greek usage.  This is an important proof passage for Christ's descent to hell in the Apostles' Creed.  The study notes in this Bible dismiss the meaning found in historic Greek usage without explanation.  Notes on the communion sacrifice in Leviticus 3 overlook the way these type of sacrifices were common throughout the ancient world and had the effect of uniting God and people through a shared meal.  The Jerusalem Bible with Notes recognizes the sacramental aspect of the communion sacrifice in Leviticus.  If you can use the German language, check the very excellent Stuttgarter Erklaerungsbibel available from the German Bible Society (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft) in Stuttgart.  All in all, it is a more satisfactory study Bible. I seldom quote notes from the Concordia Self-study Bible, but often quote (in English) notes from the Stuttgarter Erklaerungsbibel.	2004-12-18

I bought the first four volumes in 1967.  I bought the Supplementary volume when it was first published.  I use the set often.  It has a wealth of knowledge.  But, too often basic information about the meaning of the biblical text or biblical themes is short-changed in favor of devoting space to specualtions about form critical topics that yield no useful information.  This is especially true in articles related to the Gospels.  An index to help the user find discussions of particular Greek or Hebrew words could be helpful.

The German Bible Society catalog and the opening pages of this volume both state it is the 27th edition of the Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament and identical to the UBS 4th edition text.  These are an original language edition, not Modern Greek.  It has the same critical apparatus and cross-references all Nestle-Aland editions have.  (The 27th edition was slightly revised and updated.) The print is very crisp with no confusion over rough or smooth breathing marks and accents.<br />The German texts are both good Modern German.  Because the German texts are printed two columns to a page, the font for the German versions is a little on the small side, but still readable without difficulty by most people.  The Einheits&uuml;bersetzung New Testament text is an ecumenical text, although primarily produced by Roman Catholics.  For a number of years this was my primary text for personal Bible reading, even though I am not a Roman Catholic.  It is a very readable text and quite accurate.  I also have several study Bibles that use the 1984 Luther text.  It is also very accurate and very readable, although it tries to preserve some of the feel and cadence of the very early Luther versions, somewhat like the Modern King James Version in English tries to preserve the feel and the cadence of the normally available King James Version.<br />The size of this volume is no longer the familiar pocket edition size known to generations who used the Greek New Testament.  It is a bit oversized and hard to fit into a normal jacked pocket.  Because the Greek text is on one page and the two German editions are on the facing page, it is a thicker volume than the usual Greek New Testament.  Still, for anyone who wishes to carry a printed copy of these versions and use them together to preserve and improve one's German and one's Greek, it is a good volume to purchase.	2004-02-03

Forty years ago I used Machen as the first year text by which I learned New Testament Greek.  Over the years, I have used this text to teach a few interested persons New Testament Greek one-on-one.  I tried another text once, but its arrangement of subjects seemed out of place.  For me, the great feature of Machen is the numerous exercise sentences at the end of each chapter.  Too many first year texts provide the students with too few exercise sentences by which they can practice what they have learned.<br />It is not really a book for self-study.  But, with the help of a teacher who has studied New Testament Greek, it is simply the best book available after its nearly 80 years in print.  That alone speaks much in its behalf.	2004-01-07

The stated purpose of the book is to show that recent scandals involving DNA on a blue dress, etc. are not out of the ordinary, but that our history has been riddled with scandals.  Since the author writes for the Washington Post (a paper that went easy on Bill Clinton's scandals and generally favors Democrats), I began to suspect this book is an attempt to rehabilitate Bill Clinton and assist in restoring his legacy.  If that was the intent, the author meanders from his target without aim. The book presents some very interesting anecdotes, many of which are not particularly scandalous.  Who cares if John Adams loudly expressed disappointment in two of his sons because they achieved only mediocrity?  So Lincoln's body was exhumed six or so times for various reasons.  It is not nice, but there is no scandal.  In addition to relating interesting stories about little known events, he shows people from other centuries also have a great capacity to be as immoral, petty, and disappointing as people in our times.  It is an interesting book to read, but in no way does it reflect one way or the other on the significance of more recent scandals, especially those involving DNA samples on blue dresses.	2004-01-05

The book is a little like a TV info-mercial.  It tells you enough to give you the general idea, but not quite enough that you can begin to implement the program yet.  At times it is hard to understand Schwarz's points.  I  made four pages of notes and reviewing them helped pull it all into one whole.  Churches interested in using Schwarz will need to contact NCD headquarters and obtain some starter materials.  Schwarz is critical of the Church Growth Movement because it too often takes what worked in one church and makes a universal application for all churhces.  Schwarz and his team used scientific data gathering and measuring principles to find principles that are truly universal over the entire world.  Implementing Schwarz's principles requires much commitment and work to achieve the level of quality in church life he encourages.  Even if Schwarz's ideas were worthless, implementing them would still give you a much more vibrant and high quality church life.

It is filled with information that demands a second reading to absorb more of what it contains.  Thanks in part to its fine index, it will serve well as a reference book for the future.  The book will be very helpful to Christians who wish to make an intelligent response to myths about the alleged guilt of Christians and Christianity for many of the world's woes.  <br />Surprises you will find in the book include the following.  Pope Pius XII, alleged to be \\"Hitler's Pope,\\" actually hid 5000 Italian Jews on Vatican property to save them from the death camps and the Israeli government wanted to honor him for his efforts.  Native peoples of the Western Hemisphere were not the noble guardians of the environment whose example still shames the reputed exploitative habits of Christians.  Many Puritans outside Salem opposed the witch trials as a great injustice.  The myth that Christians are opponents to scientific inquiry did not appear until the 1920's.  You will also find many facts about the positive influence of religion in civilization's greatest advancements, especially in curtailing war and advancing scientific discovery.        <br />The editorial review above by Ray Olson is a very fair and accurate description of the book.

It is not and that is what makes it an engrossing read well worth the time.  For example, in these times after September 11, 2001 we are concerned to give no quarter to terrorists, yet exaqctly two years earlier fourteen of sixteen convicted and unrepentant violent Puerto Rican terrorists from the FALN accepted a clemency offer made by Bill Clinton, in spite of the strenuous counsel and objections of every law enforcement agency and of Puerto Rican authorities, themselves. Clinton's unprecendented offer coincided with Hillary's bid for election as New York's junior senator and an effort to gain support in the Hispanic community there.  Olson describes in detail the normal criteria for presidential pardons, gives a history of government policy toward Puerto Rican radicals beginning with the Truman years, and describes the reaction of both prosecutors and victims of those released to live freely among us.  These things are background material we did not often get in our newspapers and TV news programs.<br />In more than eight years of the two Clintons we became numb to the daily dribble of news bits about scandals.  Olson's book gives a good concise reminder of what the Clinton's were and are so that those who read it might not become seduced by their kind again.  The book is especially good as a reminder of Hillary's determined ambitions to be powerful coupled with the extent of her Marxist indoctrination.  This book is recommended reading for anyone who might be faced with the choice of voting for Hillary or Bill for public office.  Now I am eager to read Olson's book on Hillary \\"Hell to Pay.\\" <br />This is not a simple Clinton bashing book.  It is a timely, well-documented reminder of the principles on which our nation is based and how even ardent supporters of the Clintons finally decried the many ways the Clintons flushed those principles down the toilet for personal gain.	2001-11-24

US	53050436	R3LCKSP4HY1V8D	9997590317	386355318	How to Design and Build a 200 Amp Welder (85)	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Build a welder to suit your exact need	This is not a book which tells how to build a specific welder, but one which helps you design and build a machine for parameters you set.  It is very practical and offers flexible approaches to various design and  construction decisions.  It is very complete, and there is very little use  of mathematics.  It is for the person who wants to use a unit built by  himself, and possibly wants to save a little money.  Anyone could design a  welder to run on the electrical service available, not on an ideal service  needed to accomodate a commercial stick welder.	1998-12-17

US	53050436	R1WYGNA9TDOH2K	8876535888	230004692	A Grammatical Analysis of the Greek New Testament	Books	5	12	13	N	Y	Very complete and useful	The binding is sewn and the cover is a sturdy vinyl rather than what one usually calls paperback binding.  This is a very complete analysis of vocables in the Greek New Testament with additional notes on the meaning of  various constructions.  It is a great help to most students of the Greek  New Testament.  It includes a description of grammatical terms as well as a  list of words used sixty times or more.  It is a bit thick for carrying in  one's pocket, but still very portable.	1998-12-11

This is an English version of Fritz Rienecker's \\"Sprachlicher Schluessel zum Griechischen Neuen Testament.\\"  It claims to be a translation of Rienecker with revised and more current references for the  English-speaking user.  Actually, Rogers goes beyond that to change  Rienecker's frequent insightful comments on the meaning of the text to give  a very Baptist interpretation of the text.  This is particularly evident in  passges which deal with baptism and the Lord's Supper.  The information on  the grammar and parsing of words in the Greek text is the same as  Rienecker's, and very helpful to the average reader of the Greek New  Testament.  Rogers is to be commended for making Rienecker's helps for  students of Greek available in English, but anyone who can use the German  language would be better served by procurring a copy of Rienecker's orginal  work.  Check Amazon.de to see if it is still available there, or shop the  net for dealers in used theological books.  If you do use Roger's  \\"revision\\" be aware that the theological comments are not what  the preface portrays them to be.  Also check a similar work in English by  Grosvenor and Zerwick called \\"Analysis of the Greek New  Testament.\\"  The latter work is similar, but is a bit more extensive.   It is thicker and a bit more expensive.	1998-12-09
