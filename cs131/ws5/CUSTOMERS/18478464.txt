The beauty of the book is that one can focus on the era that one is interested in. There is no need to read the book cover to cover as the various essays are stand alone although they are presented sequentially and related papers are adjacent to each other. I have read and re-read some of the papers. The book is about strategy and the realities of war. The essays are clearly balanced and not biased. The phenomenon of war was clearly explained from the studies of past wars. It is clear that war has been a fundamental reality of social and political existence from an early stage of political organisation to the present times. The tragic aspects of war and the intellectual and emotional disturbances it creates could be discerned from the essays.<br /><br />The book is divided into the following five parts:<br /><br />Part One:  The Origins of Modern War.<br /><br />Part Two: The Expansion of war<br /><br />Part Three: From the Industrial Revolution to the First World War.<br /><br />Part Four: From the First to the Second World War.<br /><br />Part Five: Since 1945.<br /><br />The eminent contributors include Peter Paret, Felix Gilbert, John Shy, Gordon A. Craig, Maurice Matloff, Condoleezza Rice, Lawrence Freadman, Michael Carver and D. Clayton James. Their essays showed the role of force in the relations between states. It is now very clear to me that war has always been a compound of many elements ranging from politics to technology, to human emotions under extreme stress. Strategy is one of the critical elements of war.<br /><br />The various essays trace the ideas and actions of past generations, as they used war to achieve their national goals, an analysis of military thought and policy in the recent past and present<br /><br />My favourite part is Part Two. Here three great historical figures are highlighted namely Napoleon, Jomini and Clausewitz. I can now see the genius of Napoleon as one of the greatest soldiers in history in its proper strategic context. I think history need to rescue Jomini from the obscurity he is now relegated since it is largely him who has clearly related the greatness of Napoleon and the attempt to reduce war to some sort of science.<br /><br />Makers of Modern Strategy add immense value to any study of warfare and strategy. I recommend it to Army Staff Colleges and those studying military history at postgraduate level.lausewitz.

Clearly, the authors of this wonderful book were gifted scholars who could succinctly condense the long chronology of the work of God in a relatively small book. I read the book from the point of view of studying it and to appreciate the immense meaning behind the numerous writings. The Holy Bible is a collection of writings that have profoundly influenced the course of history, more than any other book. Many people, whether they are believers or atheists or belong to any other religion or belief, need to realise that the Bible had a huge impact in shaping who most people in the world are and how they think.<br /><br />The Bible has shaped Western civilization for thousands of years. It explains the origins of the world and all that is on it, how heavens and the earth were created, the land and the seas, the animals on the land and the various creatures that live in the water, how man was created, why we die and where we go after death. It has shaped people's values and laws in many countries. It teaches how people should live, what is right and what is wrong, how people should conduct themselves, and guided our ethical values and morality.<br /><br />The writings in the Bible are timeless. From the writings, we are given various examples of how to make the right choices, so that we can live good and meaningful lives. For example, the story of Cain and Abel teach us to avoid being envious. The story of Job teach us that bad things can happen to good people, but with faith and hope, people can overcome the suffering.  Psalms teach us about prayer in praise of the Lord, in thanksgiving, acknowledgement of faith and trust in God and confession of sin. The story of David reminds us of the power of dreaming big dreams and overcoming great odds.<br /><br />The Bible is the most widely read book ever and still continue to be read widely worldwide. This is because the message of the Bible is relevant today as it was thousands of years ago. The teachings from the Bible about how to live good lives are as valid today as there were thousands of years ago. The Ten Commandments are equally valid today as when they were first brought down from My Sinai, by Moses about four thousand years ago.<br /><br />Whether one is a believer or not, reading the bible is encouraged so as to understand what has shaped the lives and societies of Western civilisation and those countries that have been under their influence. If one is a believer, I would recommend that at least during their lifetime, they take a journey of going through the Bible from the first page to the last.ds of years ago.

I am from an Anglophone country and would like to have a basic understanding of French. I have some books teaching basic French but I also needed a dictionary to refer to when I read words that I do not understand. I tried a number of dictionaries until I settled on this one for a number of reasons. The dictionary is easy to read and understand.<br /><br />The dictionary is divided in two. The first half shows French words with English translation. The other half is the other way round. This makes it easy if one meets a French word and is looking for the meaning in English or an English word and one is looking for the meaning in French. In addition to showing the meaning of the words, there are also some phrases and sentences to show the reader how a word in used in a sentence or phrase.<br /><br />The dictionary is designed for those wishing to acquire the basic French language. When I visit a French speaking country, I am now able to undertake basic communication and can get my way around.  In a restaurant, I can order my food and at least know the names of the most common food items and drinks. Nowadays when I see a French newspaper or magazine, I try to read it and use the dictionary to find any words I do not understand. By so doing, I find that my French continues to improve.	2005-09-22

It explains various important aspects pertaining to writing effective non-fiction book proposals. The aspects highlighted are how to test-market the potential of a book idea, choosing the best agents and editors and trying to influence publishers to make a good offer.<br /><br />I have read several hundreds of books but somehow with this book failed to impress me. I was in the process of writing my first book, but I could not find this book to be of much practical use to my book writing project. The title of the book to me did not relate to the contents and the flow appeared haphazard. Each chapter in isolation could be readable and make sense but one chapter does not logically lead to the next. I read this book having completed reading another one entitled \\"Writing Nonfiction- Turning Thoughts into Books by Dan Poynter\\". The contrast could never be starker. I had hoped that the book would be a natural follow on after reading the delightful little book by Dan Poynter. However, I was very disappointed and the book was a waste of my money.	2005-09-22

It is direct and to-the-point. It is about 70 pages long and can fit in a jacket pocket which means that if you are busy implementing change, you can quickly read it (for example while in the metro going to and from work). This is also ideal if you need to implement change management soon or you are already implementing it and you need quick guidance on the way forward. If you are a facilitator or consultant and you need to present a crash course on managing change, you will find this little book very handy.<br /><br />The book is divided into four sections namely:<br /><br />* Understanding Change<br /><br />* Planning Change<br /><br />* Implementing Change<br /><br />* Consolidating Change<br /><br />These areas pretty covers all the main areas one would require when involved in a change process. The book is cheap and I would buy it for everyone involved in the change process, from the top of the organisation hierarchy to the front-line staff.<br /><br />The book's main advantage of its compactness is also its main limitation. Not all the information required to become an effective change agent can be accommodated in a 70 or so page book. The book is excellent for a person looking for an entry-level book on the topic of managing change. This book will give you a good base structure from which to work. However, a more advanced student of change management would need to seek other books on the subject. I would recommend this book as a quick read while travelling.	2005-09-22

Management was one of my favourite subjects then since I needed practical guidance on how to effectively plan, lead, motivate, organise and control my large department in my organisation with large numbers of subordinates under me. I then found the book to be very useful, easy to understand and logical and I used it to achieve excellent results in the subject.<br /><br />Some few years after graduation, I was back at the university, being a part time lecturer in Management. I again used the book as one of the recommended textbooks. I have since stopped lecturing and still find that the authors have kept the book updated and relevant to the current thinking and practice of management. For students doing an undergraduate course in management, I strongly recommend the book as it is comprehensive, properly structured to introduce the subject and then step-by-step develop it to the end. As a facilitator, I also find the Annotated Instructor's Edition to be very handy as it covers all the topics that are required at undergraduate level and help the instructor prepare and conduct classes. The various \\"Insights\\" are very important in highlighting some aspects of the topics. The numerous case studies are also very critical in reinforcing the practical application of the important and interesting subject of management.	2005-09-22

The book is well structured and provides a step-by-step guide to the essential principles. I found the book easy to use, to be clear and reflected the current practice to the subject. The book explains management and employee perspective and their interaction in the work place. It also provides a substantial treatment of human resource management practice.<br /><br />What I appreciated about this book is that it provides practical advice that I can use in my organisation to improve its effectiveness. I also used it as a reference book in my Doctor of Business Administration course I am currently pursuing. Being based in an African country, what it teaches is very relevant and useful in African organisations.<br /><br />The book is divided into eleven parts that cover the whole range of human resource management topics namely:<br /><br />* Human resource management<br /><br />* Human resource management process<br /><br />* Organisational behaviour<br /><br />* Work and employment<br /><br />* Organisation, jobs and roles<br /><br />* Employee resourcing<br /><br />* Performance management<br /><br />* Human resource development<br /><br />* Rewarding people<br /><br />* Employee relations<br /><br />* Health, safety and welfare<br /><br />* Employment and human resource management services.<br /><br />I would not recommend the book to those who are looking for basic knowledge about human resource management as the book covers in detail the major issues pertaining the human resource management. However, for those students who are familiar with the subject or have done an undergraduate course on the subject and wish to pursue the subject at postgraduate level, this is the right book for you. You will benefit from the in-depth treatment of the theory and best practices in the area.

Although the book is small, it is packed with practical advice and guidance on how to manage the change process in organisations or departments within organisations.<br /><br />The rapid changes that characterise the current operating environment means that managers are almost always engaged in managing change of one form or another. To cope with the challenges of initiating and managing change can be a daunting task for most managers. I found the book to be very useful to me in managing change in my department. The areas I found most useful were on dealing with resistance to change and preparing plans and budgets for change.<br /><br />The book is divided into six chapters namely:<br /><br />* Introduction<br /><br />* Choosing the right level of participation<br /><br />* Assessing the implications of a change management situation<br /><br />* Dealing with resistance and survivor issues<br /><br />* Working through the change process<br /><br />* Applying the change process<br /><br />The book is small enough that even a busy executive is able to finish it is a short period of time. I read most of it during a long intercontinental flight. The various scenarios (small case studies) reinforce the issues presented in the book. I recommend the book to those who need a simple, easy to follow guide on how to effectively manage the change process.	2005-09-22

The book covers the diverse range of subjects relevant to human resource management namely work psychology, personnel management, industrial relations, business organizations,  training and development and law. The book managed to present all these subjects in a concise and easy to understand manner.<br /><br />Part one of the book gives a good background to human resources. The authors cover subjects one often encounters in general management namely leadership, groups and teams, motivation and communication among others. The second part of the book covers influences on the behaviour of employees focusing on individual differences as well as physical and psychological influences on work. Part three is a large section dealing with various topics on practical aspects of human resources. The areas that interested me the most are human resource planning, job analysis and specifications, employee appraisals and training and development.<br /><br /> The last part compares human resource practices in various countries in Europe. This is unique in that very often we learn about human resources focusing in only one country (usually the UK or the USA) and should one go to another country, one is ill-equipped for the challenges one is going to confront. In this era of globalisation, the authors need to be commended for their foresight on the need to widen the scope of knowledge of human resource practices in other countries.<br /><br />The book is very suitable for people who are looking for basic human resource knowledge and expertise at undergraduate level or those managers and practitioners who have very little knowledge and background of human resources. For those studying for postgraduate qualifications (eg a Masters in Human Resources), they need to seek for other books as this is too basic. In fact, the fact that it covers a wide range of areas means that the areas are superficially covered in most cases.areas are superficially covered in most cases.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-22

This book provided me with most the information I needed.<br /><br />The book will enable the reader to use the theory underlying corporate financial decisions to assess advanced corporate issues and decisions. The major topics covered in the book include financial statements, valuation of cash flows, capital structure and budgeting, risk and return, use of debt and equity, cash and credit management and international corporate finance, among other topics.<br /><br />The book has a wide range of learning tools that should facilitate the learning process. Reference to several website reinforces the concepts being presented in the book. Whether one is a student wishing to learn the important subject of finance or a manager wishing to manage the company finances more effectively, this is a good choice of book.<br /><br />The only limitation I found in the book is its main focus on US systems only with few examples on what is happening in Europe and elsewhere. To learn about the City Institutions (London) or European Stock Exchanges, for example, you have to search for your information elsewhere. Notwithstanding this, I enjoyed reading the book, particularly self-assessing my understanding by attempting the exercises in the CD-ROM which comes with the book.	2005-09-20

Instead of leaving from pay cheque to pay cheque every month for the whole of one's life, the author is advocating something better and smatter. From one's salary, one needs to put aside residual income for investment. This the author calls building a pipeline. An investment yield returns all the time, any time of the day, in good and bad times, whether one is sick or not. Just like a pipeline, which once constructed keeps pumping daily, year in, year out, whether one is there or not? With a paying job, one is trading time for a pay cheque (a day's work for a day's pay) but if one falls ill and is no longer able to work, the pay cheque also stops and life grinds to a halt for those people who never thought6 of investing in a pipeline, but instead were to content live from month to month on their salaries.	2005-08-06

He illustrates several excellent examples of wealthy people who credit their prosperity to a great idea that was picked from a good book. There are hundreds and thousands of books out there but the author cites some classics which from my own experience and reading, can attest to their greatness. These include inspirational/motivational books like Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz, The Strangest Secret by Earl Nightingale, The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale, Acres of Diamonds by Russell Conwell and The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino. The right book at the right time can make a huge difference to one's life.<br /><br />The right book depends on one's goals in life. If in management, one needs to seek the right management books to be guided to success, such as management books by gurus like Peter Drucker. Many people complain of busy lives with no time for reading. However, the author shows that one only needs to spare about 15 minutes a day for reading and this can make a tremendous difference. He also gives tips about how one can read more effectively. From reading a good book, we can talk to great men and women who give us their valuable thoughts and insights.<br /><br />Whole cultures have been changed by some compelling books. The author cites ten such books which most would agree that they changed the world to a significant extent. These include The Bible, writings by Greek philosophers like Plato, Socrates and Aristotle, The Magna Carta of 1215, The Gutenberg Bible, the 95 Theses by Martin Luther, the plays and sonnets by Shakespeare, the American Declaration of Independence (1776), the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, the Communist Manifesto and Hitler's MeinKampf (my struggle).

John Maxwell did a good job of writing a small book packed with useful guidance on how to be an effective leader.  He divided the book into three parts. The first part describes how one can develop as a leader, whilst the second part explains the traits of a leader and the last part is on the impact that a leader can have on people.<br /><br />The need for a clear vision as a leader becomes very apparent after reading the book. As a leader one should be aiming at producing a lasting legacy, that is, one should be aiming at making a difference to the lives of others. Followers should be willing to follow you because of the positive influence that you have on people as a good leader. To be an effective leader, one needs to continually develop oneself. High quality leadership entails empowering others to exercise their huge potential for the benefit of the organisation or the team. Followers have to trust you as a leader and trust has to be earned from one's actions.<br /><br />One cannot hope to be an exceptional leader unless one is self-disciplined. Leadership starts with being able to lead yourself before one can lead others.<br /><br />The book is written in simple easy to follow style which makes it readable by anyone at leadership position in an organisation or other sphere of life.	2005-08-06

The book enables the synthesis of knowledge required for a manager to carry out his/her duties effectively.<br /><br />I did an MBA course in 1989-1992 (part time basis).

During the same period, the rest of the airline industry was generally experiencing poor economic and financial performance. She studied SWA, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and United Airlines, to examine their organisational practices and approaches. From the studies, she was able to present logical and systematic arguments, proposals and findings, which are practical and can be applied to other airlines<br /><br />The Southwest Airlines Way explains that SWA's extraordinary performance was as a result of organisational practices that deliberately overcome the divisive effects of functional boundaries. This is achieved through transforming relationships between management and frontline employees, among frontline employees, and with key external partners.<br /><br />Coordination is supported by a coherent set of organisational practices that encourage people to think of their jobs as being linked to broader processes, involving people in other functional areas, rather than thinking of their jobs as a set of discrete tasks. SWA has been able to build and sustain high performance relationships among managers, employees, unions and suppliers. The relationships are characterised by shared goals, shared knowledge and mutual respect.	2005-05-05
