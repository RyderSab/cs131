The topic of infectious disease is easily misinterpreted by terms such as \\"the deadly_________\\" that pervades the cheap popular press, but none of that here. She also writes with accuracy from having read the relevant literature.  I do not think this a children's book but rather a chatty and intelligent exploration of the plagues of our times. I would place on the level of Hans Zinsser, Macfarlane Burnet but without the inevitable academic claptrap. Whether she will continue her frank and unembroidered style as she continues in academic medicine is anybodies guess, but if anyone can write a history of AIDS, she can!	2005-03-24

It is not grist for the femininist mill of exploitation and paranoia. It is a true story of how things work in a well managed brothel. The women are suspicious and are only convinced by weeks of close contact to reveal their inner-selves (as they perceive them).  Dr. Albert has removed the scarlet letter and show that these are American women who made a choice about making a living or supporting their children, husbands or boyfriends (read pimps). They provide a service to men clients who are far more pathetic than the women. Facing a lineup of women that they can rent in order to achieve something as ridiculous as orgasm explains a lot about men. Are they totally lacking in imagination? Admittedly a skilled working girl can not only amuse and titillate and detumesce their client's pitiful needs, the fact remains that there is confusion of commercial sex with male concupiscience.<br /><br />As an argument for regulated prostitution it is compelling. That women have the right to work, that they should be secure and protected from disease is given. That management should be assertive for both workers and clients is no surprise. Should it be allowed in the rest of the US? Probably not unless run by the Department of the Treasury or some central authority. Will it ever work in the rest of the country? Only if the income is great enough, like casino gambling, to interest local authority.<br /><br />From a business view, prostitution has a very limited cash basis since each woman can only treat one client at a time(usually) and the throughput of the system cannot be increased to  make it capitol intensive.<br /><br />Perhaps Dr. Albert would feel more of a vocation in psychiatry to try to have a better understanding of motivations.<br /><br />An excellent book is a photographic atlas called \\"the Brothels of Nevada\\" by Timothy Hursley (see my review)	2004-08-17

First, the movies have created quite a different image of brothels. As opposed to the pleasure palaces of Victorian Chicago or the upstairs at the saloon, the real brothels of today's Nevada are mostly double wide house trailers singly or in groups (since in the beginning they had to be mobile because of changing zoning ordinances). The excellent large format images shown are not girly pictures and in fact there almost no human figures to be seen. Rather they are a demonstration of a part of America seldom seen and even less understood..<br /><br />The economics of brothels is not well studied. Naturally owners are intent on the greatest possible profits from the least investment. Since the women work on a piece work basis (no pun) it is difficult to increase the throughput of the operation. To construct a spledid brothel is almost a conflict in terms. Instead, brothels are constructed as a compromise in tastes. What is the minimum place attractive to clients who by definition are unsophisticated but that will not affect business? The women in turn concoct their living-working rooms intended to demonstrate their own taste or lack of it.<br /><br />For all the housewives with their fanatasies of escaping their bloated husband and being paid for those services thy have contributed in the past, the alternative of those clusters of double wides may be sometimes attractive.<br /><br />Hursley has captured a lonely and wistful collection of images that are classic Americana. I urge you to read the companion book, \\"Brothel\\" by Alexa Albert to form your own conclusions.	2004-08-17

The first was the widespread use of wet suits and self contained underwater breathing devices. The observer no longer was tethered to the shore and could hang motionless in the water at almost any depth observing what was actually happening in the submerged cosmos. Underwater photography allowed dynamic and objective views. Gone were the days of waders and buckets and dry heads.<br /><br />John Steinbeck in the introduction to between Pacific Tides of 1948 also sensed a different change, an Enlightenment, \\"The world is being broken down to be built up again, and eventually the sense of the new worlds will come out of the laboratory and penetrate into the smallest living techniques and habits of the whole people\\". And of course in 1953 Watson and Crick announced the functional structure of DNA.<br /><br /> Ricketts, one the greatest naturalists of all time, was astounded at the array of creatures, mostly animals he found along the shore.  He wrote of what he saw and was ostracized by the \\"legitimate\\" academic Poo Bahs of his day. But he was clean and pure and loved true things. How would he feel if he could see all of his sea animals displayed in comparative genomics arrays and consider the genes that make them holy?<br /><br />But about the book. Tamm has captured the light hidden behind the towering figure of Steinbeck and \\"Doc\\". He shows Ricketts, complex, gifted and maybe all mixed up as an existensional figure laboring under the stigma of never having taken a degree. Thank God! If Ricketts had become the academic soft science ecologist like David Phillips who revised the fifth edition of Tides, my life would have been far poorer.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book, but don't stop there. Review Sweet Thursday and the Row. Go once again the the Sea of Cortez. Try to find a 1939 edition of Tides and then the 5th edition so you can properly despise Stanford University Press.

Having just returned from Havana I find this book to be the most disingenuous exercise I can remember. While there are certainly facts and history aplenty, the author, who must work for a certain company, makes Havana as repugnant as possible. The blockade, engineered by fanatics who fled Havana for Miami to avoid prosecution or persecution these forty years ago continues without any sane reason. There is a refreshing intellectual life. Civil liberties are no more endangered in Havana than in Alabama or the Bronx. US citizens are now required by the Bush administration to have exit visas from the US issued by the Treasury Department. A nurse told me that Cuba is a third world country. I told her that a Third World country wouldn't have universal health care, no illiteracy, no threat of  AIDS, no perinatal mortality, and a system of preventative medicine to be envied. No, I told her, it is I who live in a third world country.<br />In his litany of deficiencies the author fails to compare anything. Streets are bad. Compared to Baltimore? Slums. Compared to Newark?

From his motorcycle adventures,  to the Congo, to his death at the hands of hired assassins it's a life transcending life, passion beyond simple belief and a macabre martyrdom exceeding savagery. Anderson, no slouch at romantic adventures of his own, has done a definitive job of explaining someone who strode the earth as a giant and died the same way, without apology and without regrets. I hope the picture may be some day complete with an equally detailed account of  of the monomaniacal Felix Rodriguez, who is the eminence gris of this and other intrigues of our times.

I remember sitting under an eucalyptus tree in Ethiopia in 1982 and listening to Marxist-Leninist Internationalism and how peasants who had never seen an industry or a capitalist were being exploited by the forces of imperialism. Reading the classic books of Che Guevara and his obsessive dreams of emancipation by guerillas, it is almost like an exposition on the devine rights of kings or a doctrine of a flat earth. But if you know the rest of the story about this man you expect all the things he says. It all fits in with the battle of Santa Clara, his dreams of turning the Congo into Cuba or inspiring Bolivian farmers to unite in the dream of transforming the old and corrupt into something beautiful and new. I think that this book should be a required part of a liberal education, not because it preaches bloody revolution but rather that Che Guevara is an icon of our times, martyred, mutilated and buried in a field by people who would never understand why he made the sacrifices he did or even what he wanted to say.	2003-05-12

Physical chemistry and chemists are percieved by most people as being dull and mostly boring, Cathy Cobb has appointed herself to vivify not only the subject matter, but to create a lively account that would be entertaining to the advanced highschool student. She has embellished and rationalized the lives and times of many of the great figures while assuming an almost flippant familiarity with the subject matter and her subjects. Some of her explanations of complex issues border on brilliance while others are much less well founded. There are in addition, errors of both substance and proof reading that speak for a casual attitude toward the reader.

The retention of ancient beliefs and customs in the face of overwhelming evidence that they are myths, and that a majority of Americans believe in Angels and Miracles, yet also believe that the laws of physics are immutable, all combine to form the basis of the religious superstition that blew down the World Trade Centers. It is indeed a struggle to ennunciate the commonalities of such a convoluted web of irrationality and cognitive dissonance. But she does without offense. She writes well with astounding scholarship.

This one is unusual in that despite its ghastly book jacket, soberly approaches (perhaps too soberly) the most colorful region of the United States. The Wild West of film and pulp westerns lasted only about fifteen years while the Arkansas Wild West has extended from the 1820s until the present day. But, it is also more than a history of scoundrels in elected office, corrupt fundamentalist preachers, bozos, ... and bumpkins. It chronicles a society that produced ..., local Rockefeller philanthropy, the triumph over hookworm and pellagra. Indeed, the only place in America that Bill Clinton could be from is Arkansas. Nobody would ever believe it if this were a movie.<br />On the down side, the text is uneven, and often stilted.

Some mummies are probably preserved more by accident rather than intention while others are the subjects of elaborate embalming (cf Nature 413:837-841, 2001). She has included all manner of ancient remains and although her knowledge of paleo-PCR and RNA signatures from reverse transcription is somewhat ephemeral she has done both her footwork and her homework very well. One bizarre practice, that of preserving \\"wet\\" modern day mummies in liquid nitrogen in the uninformed belief that they can somehow be resurrected at sometime in the future demonstrates the continued gullibility of the ignorant.<br />  Another emerging technology not mentioned is in preserving bone marrow stem cells or other somatic cells in the frozen state for eventual cloning by nuclear transfer. Cells from at least one former president rest in a freezer somewhere (but without the intention of eventual cloning).<br />  Be that as it may, Pringle's book is a wellspring of information on the philosophy and practice of preserving the human body.	2002-01-17

The author does not acknowledge the intellectual ferment of the time when the Enlightenment was being crushed under the heels of van Herder and by the Romantic curse (that we still enjoy as political correctness). The greatest contribution of the Linne's systematics was the &quot;taxonomic key&quot; that allows some order out of biology, not his fatuous attempts to make booze out of lichens or grow pineapples in Bothnia.<br />I suppose other historians of &quot;science&quot; will someday mock Aristotle for his ignorance of DNA and not knowing how many teeth women have, but really, this is a silly book.	2002-01-07

Dear Jenny (as I now think of her),  has produced a brilliant picture that is believable without intrusive arguments or batteries of boring illusions or references. One caveat- you either need a rather large magnifying glass to appreciate the many figures and plates or access to at least a folio collection of prints.	1998-01-06

In the Swedish translation, at least, Gaarder once again asserts his amazing creativity in supposing what the victim of that great con man, Augustine, Bishop of Hippo would write in a literary reply to Augustine's &quot;Confessions&quot;. He strips the pompous hypocracy down to human essentials and gives a feeling account of what was more likely to have happened. Not only believable, he has created an image of a woman who is more real than any historical account. If Gaarder ever approaches Paul of Tarsus in the same way he may start a new religion.	1997-12-31
