I was very aggravated with Callie from time to time & wanted to shake her but at the same time she is a very likeable character. I loved the time period & the author did a fantastic job writing about the South.  I hope that the author gives us more like this book.  Read it!!

I'm not sure why but I did not enjoy this book. I think the two friends Sweety Boy & Jacob ruined the book for me.  I wasn't prepared for the hint of incest & just didn't like their characters.  I felt sorry for Morgan Lee.  Her disfunctional family wasn't a lot of help to her.	2004-09-30

I didn't quite know what to expect as I started reading her latest book, Just Doll, but I should have known that it would be good also.  Different from her others, but good all the same.  I love historical fiction & especially the time period of this setting.  Her characters were believeable & at times I became totally involved in Doll's life.  I even found myself giving her advice.  I didn't become as involved with Daniel's life, but I'm not sure why.  I am looking forward to the next two books in this series.	2004-09-23

I was exited to hear it was taking place in Canton &amp; the story sounded great but somewhere along the line the book just didn't prove to be what it could have been.
