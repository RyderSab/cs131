Babe Ruth or Ty Cobb.\\"  Browning realizes that there have always been great players of the game. However, by the ending of the book, he proves that Cy Young's name should be up there with Cobb and Ruth.  Mays, Ryan, Bonds, Koufax, Aaron.... outstanding players.  However, for reasons that I'll not go into here, you need to read the book, to understand why there are many great players that are true legends.... Walter Johnson, Ted Williams.  However, No one has come close to Ruth, Cobb, and Young,  when you look at the big picture.  Ruth was bigger than life, and I remember my grandfather talking about taking a train to New York just to set in the grand stadium known \\"as the house that Ruth built,\\" and watch Ruth come up to the plate.  A lot of the old-timers talked about Cobb playing the game more like a civil war battle. As for Young, at this point in time, there is no one living who can remember him as a player in his prime.  The possible youngest person to see him perform in a major league game, would be at least 95 to 100 only to remember him as a player in his mid-forties with quite a gut.  Browning states that this is one of the problems.   Sure, there are still those baseball players that remember talking to the legend back in the 1950's when he was in his eighties, but one point Browning makes is that those who remember Young the pitcher are all gone. He also tells why Cobb and Ruth are usually remembered more, and have many books and movies of them, unlike Young.  Ruth could drink and curse and raise hell with the best of 'em, and could usually be found at a whore house when not at home.  Cobb who refused to play even exihibition games againt colored people, and was well known for his hot temper, and his hatred of anyone who crossed him (and that was almost everyone).  Anyway the point here, isthat an interesting life on and off the field makes more of a sensation to read about or watch.  Cy Young, who was never thrown out of a game, led a very quite and normal life off the field.  On and off the field he was a gentleman...... Not usually the stuff interesting books and movies are made of. Please don't think this book is about comparing Young, Ruth, and Cobb. this is only the opening of the book.  Even though Young was a \\"gentleman\\" he didn't take any crap off anyone either. Cobb who was well known for his aggresiveness, and crowding the plate, years later said that he knew when Young warned me.... I'd best move out some or I'd be hit and hard.  It's really a great book about a true baseball hero on and off the field. One final point Browning shows....... Young was not just great because of his records, of at least five that will probably never be broken. He was the greatest flexible player.  Baseballs rules changed more in the 1890's and 1900's more than any other time. Read the book.  Unreal that this man could remain at the tops from 1890-1911 with all those changes. Perhaps my review has bored you..... I promise if you love the game and the history of baseball, you won't want to put the book down.	2005-06-23

Read the other review of this book, as he does a nice job in explaining the good and bad of the book.  Things I liked about this book..... It brings up ideas, and mentions facts that have been left out of many Borden books. Radin knew how to write a good book. This wasn't the first book I've read on Lizzie Borden, but it is one of the best I have read. The first Lizzie Borden book I read was - LB by Arnold Brown. I would say Brown's book, or Radin's would be the best to start off with. True Brown say's that Lizzie didn't do it, and Radin points the finger at \\"Maggie\\" - However, both of these book  are very entertaining and even if you do not believe the conclusion of who they pick as the killer, they do not taint the whole book with a bunch of BS. They do a really good balanced job in telling the Borden tale. Both books are great starting points. To be honest, Radin's conclusion of blaming Bridget isn't so wild of an idea. He doesn't force it down your throat either. The only thing I really didn't like, was his bashing of other books on Lizzie. Bashing almost to the point of - My book is best because the other books state this, that,  and so on. He should have just explained his book, and let others decide on the other books out there...... By the way,  most of his statements about the other books are true. However, Pearson's Trial of Lizzie Borden doesn't deserve the page after page of bashing Radin gives it. I have read the original Trial Transcript (not in whole) and Pearsons book. True Pearson is one sided, but his book also has some interesting thoughts and information you can't find in other books. I'd start with Radin's book, and then read 40 whacks, and in my opinion the best balanced book (despite the title) - Lizzie Didn't Do It! by William Masterton. However, if your new to the Borden murders, I wouldn't start with Masterton's book. I'd read this one or Brown's first.	2005-03-26
US	42362655	R26RVVAEWRLZDL	0913383333	761299453	Assassination at the State House: The Unsolved Mystery of Kentucky's Governor Goebel	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	Not Sure  ?	This was a tough one to review.  Based on the type of \\"historical non-fiction\\" that I am use to reading, I didn't like the style. The subject is very interesting - A true assassination mystery, and  almost a political civil war.  I happened upon a rare copy of  the 1905 My Own Story by Caleb Powers (If you can find a copy of this I highly suggest buying it or checking it out of a large library) Anyway, Caleb was accused of being one of eight people that were sent to prison for the assassination - Great story, and I won't spoil the outcome. However, after reading this book, I wanted to find a book that would tell the other side of the story. I ordered this book.  The introduction to this book was great. Also, the last chapter is great.  The author tells us his personal thoughts of what happened to the people involved. The author has researched the Goebel Assassination, and I would say he knows as much information on this assassination as anyone past and present. The book also has some great pictures. What the author has done is a shame, and for me, I could not read large sections of the book for thinking..... Why the hell didn't he make this \\"100% history\\" He tells the story of the 1899 election, and the political campaign, and this assassination so well. However, he felt.... I guess? He would make it more enjoyable by telling the true non-fictional history, but adding a novel type approach, by putting words into people's mouths. Why couldn't he just tell the factual story, and not add stuff from chapter two, to almost the end.... Like Bill was at the general store and ran into Jim. Hey Jim guess you heard about the election last night. Bill had a big grin on his face sitting in a green chair next to a spitoon. He said, yea Jim I guess we all heard about it, but old man Johnson didn't hear the story. Why don't you tell what happened that election night. Old man Johnson woke up, Yea, tell me that story........ That's the type of crap I couldn't stand.  Why add all thedumb make-believe stuff. I don't know,  nor do I care to hear about Bill whoever,  and his big grin, or the color of a chair.  If this was a novel ok.  If you write a children's book ok. I guess I just don't like historical-novels.  Sometimes, it's best to use this approach,  if there are very few real facts known. However, that's not the case.  There is a lot of information out there, but besides Caleb Power's version, I can't find that one book that can tell (both sides of) this story. If the author had only left out the \\"jim said\\"  \\"bill said, with a grin on his face\\" this would have been a really good book. Very frustrating to me. Because of the introduction and the pictures and the ending I can only give this two stars because of the writing style. However, for those of you who can and don't mind mixing facts of history with fiction, you would enjoy the book and would probably give it four stars.  I only hope that at some future date the author would write \\"only the facts\\" Assassination at the State House.	2005-03-11

Porter who worked as a journalist for one of Fall River newspapers decided to cash in on the Borden trial. How many books were printed is unknown, but a good judgement would be 200 to 1,500.  As the story goes, Lizzie on the instructions of her lawyers, was to buy up all the books and destroy them. 1. That doesn't make sense and 2. It's not true.  If the book had been way out of line perhaps Lizzie would have filed for a law suit. However, during the trials the papers were a lot more harsh than this matter-of-fact somewhat bland book. While in jail,  one of Lizzie's request was to not be given the newspaper. Did she buy up the books or threaten Porter.... No.  If the book had been that popular at the time,  Porter would have had more printings. Also, lets say Lizzie paid him off to not make anymore editions. This was before the 1923 copyright law. If the book was in that great of demand it would have been reprinted many times between 1893 and 1985.  Even the 1985 edition was kept at 1,000 prints. No,  the truth of the matter, not many books were printed and the ones that were, were of very cheap paper quality... Most of the copies ended up in library's, and when worn out.... trashed. If the quality of the pages had been better, then rebinding would have been considered. However, if the pages are cheap and 90% acid... little could be done. Some of the copies that were retained by the library's were stolen. You can find at least two dozen original copies under lock and key at the larger library's. In 1985 a reprint was made of 1,000 copies. This Aug (2005) another reprint is due out.	2005-02-25

After reading Blood On The Moon, I thought this long overdue book will put the assassination at rest.  However, this book puts a brand new spin on the \\"mind of, and actions of\\" Booth. I'm not sure if I agree with the writer's conclusions,  but the book is well written and entertaining, and for those of us who thought we knew everything about the Lincoln assassination, you will  come across things never mentioned in other books.   Did you know that  Lincoln's son also went to the other Washington theater  ( the National Theater) that night, and the only reason that Seward lived through the stabbing,  was due to his neck brace.  Kauffman gives us a new and fresh look at the people involved. Like Edwin Stanton's arrival at the Peterson house.  We are told about his taking charge that night, but something usually looked over in the assassination literature, and that was this man of cold steel,  going into see the dying president, (and quite a shock to those who knew Stanton) and instead of giving out orders to those around him, he broke down and sobbed.	2005-01-09

I have never met Mr. Thompson. However in 2001 I visited Alcatraz, and had a limited time in the giftshop. I bought this book, then wondered if I had wasted $20 in my haste? No,  I couldn't put the book down. It was interesting from page 1 to page 332. He starts the book out by apologizing for only going to the 6th grade, hence the book.  He is very modest. This is a well written book. Well thought out and planned. Its hard to find a really good book you just can't put down. I have read hundreds of books. However, I put this one (for content and keeping my interest) in my top 20 favorite books. I enjoyed it so much, I sent a letter to Mr. Thompson requesting the book to be autographed, which he was happy to do. Solid five stars. I promise if you want to know about prison life, and how puppet courts use to  be (and I'm afraid some still are), then this is one damn fine book!	2005-01-05

Rogers who gave two reviews is talking about. Is he even reviewing THIS book?  Anyway, I'll have to agree with one reviewer. No matter how you look at it, this book had $$$$$$ on it. David Donald wrote probably the greatest biography of LINCOLN in the last 40 years. Why something so shallow and pricey as this? As ABBA would say \\"money, money, money\\" - David Donald has not only sold the reader short, he has sold his own ability short.  Anyone that can produce some of the prior works he has on Lincoln, and then this. Hey, this book isn't that bad as a gift (which it was for me), or something in the $1.00 bargain bin, not a bad deal at all. However, don't spend your hard earned money paying $30 (insane), $10 or even $5 on this book. Its ok, but not over $1 ok. Listen, for five dollars, I'd rather be looking over my five Dollar Lincoln instead of the five dollar Lincoln book. If your ever at a $1 book sale, I recommend! If you get it as a gift read it.	2005-01-04

I like the book cover with all the Stooges on it. Only three stars.... yes and here is why - The books format was screwed-up. The writer tried to give a biography of each Stooge, and then later on tell the story about the Stooges, with infomation being choppy and repeated.  Also what is this with Mousie Garner..... Last of the Stooge wanna-be's. Lots of pictures of about 16 Stooge wanna-be's, but not much information on them, as the only connection is that they were Ted Healy's foil. Too much homeage is paid to Healy, and I know that will make some Stooge fans blood boil, by me even saying this. He started the act, but the act was Moe, Shimp, Larry, and later Curly ( and Besser and CurlyJoe) To give Healy so much credit, is to take away from the six true Stooges. He was the straight man, but in the few films I have seen him in, Emil Sitka was a much better straight man to play off of.   Also the write up reviews acted like this book would be a tell all about Healy's death...... However only a suggestion of his death is mentiond in one paragraph. What bugged me the most was all the Moe Howard bashing. Like it was his fault the other stooges died of strokes.... being hit was part of the game..... if they didn't like it, as in Joe Bessers case, they can move on. I will say that the book did a good job in telling the story of transitions between Stooges, and good information about Besser and CurlyJoe who are normally left out of the picture.  It was interesting that Besser hated being a Stooge, until he was no longer a Stooge, and when he started seeing all the money coming in,  do to the Stooge shorts being played on TV, and all the fans, I think he realized he had made a mistake. To be honest he didn't, as his Stooge character didn't go over well - the \\"gay\\" Stooge, which he wasn't.  CurlyJoe was no Curly, and he knew that and did his own style of humor.... He is not given the credit he deserves.  I think the Stooges would have ended in 1959 if it wasn't for him, andit did end when he died in 1993.	2005-01-01

Anyway, in the mid. 90's when the anthology cd's came out and was on tv, I bought those and enjoyed them a lot.  I just happened upon this book. I enjoy knowing the history of certain bands, and despite a few people saing you can read or have a hard time reading certain pages - it's not that big of a deal. You do have to take more time and read about 10 to 20 pages. Also how large the book is and how heavy. People will complain about anything. I like hardbound books best so thats what I got. If paperback doesn't bother you get that. One final complaint is that they brag and pat each other on the back - HELLO - I find the Beatles to be very modest considering how their music changed the world. Geat pictures, and great inside stories from the Beatles. Before reading the book I had doubts about reading a book in which the people involved write the book, because an outside view is also very good for certain reasons - I would recommend Shout, and I haven't read The Beatles ten years that changed the world, but the reviews are very good. However, you really need a great book on the Beatles by an outsider, and you need one geat book from the band and thats what you have. If you like the Beatles want to know the history - this is a wonderful book to get.	2004-12-30

I gave it five to avg. out at three, because I didn't think the prior review should have given a one. I loved his first book Alias Jack the Ripper. This is the third book, and I consider Chapman as the possible Ripper in the U.K. As for the U.S.A. it's a big stretch. However, not impossible, because as other books site, and newspaper articles, and police files Chapman was in fact in the New York area during at least part of this time..... It cannot be disproved like some suspects we know they were in prison at the time and so on.  It is also a fact that around this time 'The Yard' sent an investigator from  the U.K. to the U.S.A ......... The crimes are gone into great detail and here is the strong point of the book.  Of course there is very little to connect Chapman to these murders in New York, and New Jersey. However, if you enjoyed his first book, and consider Chapman a Ripper Suspect...... I'd suggest for you to get this book..... You will enjoy.  If your after a good solid case, I'm sorry the evidence just isn't enough to convict..	2004-12-17

If a paperback copy comes along for under twenty dollars, I would push the book up to four stars. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book, but not good enough to merit the forty five dollar asking price.  I was able to get a copy for twenty-five, and that was plenty to spend on this book. Alright, now that I've talked about the price, let me talk about the book.  The title states \\" seventy persons  CITED\\" - If you buy this book keep that in mind, because in many cases that's pretty much all you get. The book I feel could have been so much better.  No pictures of any of the seventy persons to be found in the book, and please note there are extant pictures of some of these people. I'm afraid that a novice to the ripper murders will become confused, as the suspects are not treated with enough detail. Very brief on most subjects. This author certainly has gone to lengths in finding all the sources, and does a great job in listing them at the end of each suspect. The strength of the book lies in the fact that if a certain suspect interest you, you will know exactly where to go to find more information on the subject in question.  The author also gives his opinion, and you are to treat it as fact, and not to question - He does have some good thoughts, and opinions, but it AIN'T the gospel. If your after a listing of suspects, and where to look for addiional informaton this book serves that purpose excellently and gets an A+ for that.  However, if your looking for a book that goes into unbiased detail with an open mind, I'm afraid this  book misses that mark. It is an interesting read, and I do recommend it for beginners and for well versed ripper reseachers.  However, I don't recommend it, if it cost you over thirty dollars.	2004-08-28

It doesn't bother me that someone can write a book like this, as that is one of the great freedoms in living in the U.S.A. - What really bothers me is the fact that so many reviewers praise this book. At best Carter was an average president. However, as an ex-president no contest, he has done more than any former president. His charity work alone stands the test.  The seond best ex-president we had was John Q. Adams who served 20 years in the senate, and third would be REPUBLICAN Herbert Hoover ( and in part, because Truman had enough sense to use and ask for the help of an ex-president. Truman requested that Hoover help out on several national issues. If you will read in Trumans book, The Buck Stops Here, he goes into detail stating that a president is pretty dumb for not seeking the advise of a former president) - I can't believe some of the garbage in this book, but I really am concerned that anyone would rate this book above one star.......	2004-08-28

I decided to give it five, because the front cover states - \\"The controversy surrounding the last pensioners and insights into the lives of the last nine\\" - Insights pretty much means brief, which is the only information known about most of these men. The book is around 92 pages paperback, and it gives what information of the individual a paragraph to several pages (and cool pictures of seven survivors.)  If you want a long detailed account of these individuals, I don't believe it  exist. The book is hard to come by, but if you enjoy history or this type of thing, I would suggest buying the book. The spine is a little weak also.  If you look long enough you can probably find one for 20 to 30 dollars. I wouldn't suggest buying one for much more than that, unless you had some extra money you needed to get rid of. It's a good book, with good information, but it only gives what information that is out there, which isn't a lot. If you find the book for under $25 I'd say get it...... over 75 bucks a total joke	2004-05-04

However, at the ending of April and beginning of May the Confederates may have been on the run, but the government was still in function with Davis on the move but still the President - Johnston was still somewhat of a threat, and Kirby Smith still had a hold in Texas. This book wonderfully explains those last months to June, not April of 1865. I recommend this book highly, and another writer states that &quot;The Long Surrender&quot; surpassed this book. Well, in some sense both of these books cover the same time period, but I think both book are excellent. In &quot;Out Of The Storm,&quot; the focus is on the remaining holdouts beginning April 1st 1865. In &quot;The Long Surrender&quot; is a fascinating tale of the collapse of the confederate government, and the escape of Davis and his cabinet, even when it seemed all was lost, Davis still had hope of making it to Texas - Both books are different enough and interesting enough that I would recommend both books.	2004-02-10

A lot written just to make a fast buck. There are books out there that claim as many as 15 gunmen, and over 20 shots fired. Some people will believe anything they read, thats why The National Inquirer makes millions upon millions each year. However, I honestly think Thompson really wanted to find the truth, and even though his book is a first generation conspriracy book, it is an essential book to read if interested in the Kennedy Assassination. I would start with reading  1.The Warren Report, then get a copy of 2.The Zapruder film on DVD to study. Then I would suggest reading 3. Accessories After the fact (or another well written) book that blast the Commissions way they mishandled the case from the beginning. I would then suggest an early period Conspiracy book before 1970, that doesn't go into UFO's killing Kennedy. 4. Six Seconds In Dallas, is the best book that I've found for  being open minded to some degree, and looking at both sides. Some of the things he states has been proven incorrect. However, considering the first edition came out over 35 years ago,  it stands the test of time well. I was impressed with the charts, and maps of where the witnessess were shown to be located, and what they saw, and when they said, and what they told the commission, and why the commission didn't bother to interview  key witnesses. I will probably get some criticism here, but I would then pick up a copy of 5. Case Closed - it's almost like a rewrite  of the Commissions report, showing that their conclusions were correct - However, the fact findings they used were flawed, and they dismissed a lot of important information or ignored what they didn't wish to hear. But the strong point of this book, is that it tells the story, and in the footnotes it criticizes all the crazy (and some not so crazy) ideas that the modern day pro-conspirators have. From that point, you should be able to figure which route to go. I have not read Crossfire, but have been told it covers just about all the main conspiracies. There are some more books out there I could suggest, but I would have to say that most researchers into the Kennedy assassination, would have Six Seconds In Dallas on their bookshelf.	2003-12-09

It didn't hurt that Mr. Carter was once our President. However, to write a book like this, you have to have knowledge and compassion - I could never imagine some of our other former Presidents even trying to write anything like this - Johnson, Nixon, Clinton or the Bushes? Read this book, as it is entertaining, enjoyable, and if nothing else, a book you can learn from.	2003-12-07

He has amassed the best collection (and some of the pictures are not very pleasant) of the Kennedy Assassination photos I have been able to find.  I was almost afraid to buy the book because of all the sour notes about the captions, but I was not bothered by that. Even though I don't agree with Grodens thoughts on A lot of issues, it will take people like him, to demand that we need to open private files now, and not after 75 years.	2003-11-28
US	42362655	R2QVFIJHIIBUHQ	0861015681	622816732	The Torch is Passed: The Associated Press Story of the Death of a President	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Great Tribute, Great Pictures, Sad day though	For the price, if your a Kennedy fan, or have any interest in the day of the assassination and right after, I would get a copy of this thin, but tall 100 page book. Some of the text is very interesting personal stories I have not read before. Pictures of Truman and Ike at the funeral. If you can pick up a copy for under five, it is well worth the money.  However, it doesn't go into deep details. Its a memorial book presented by the associated press.	2003-11-27
US	42362655	R2Z09WYN8O4DEM	0966270975	381609046	With Malice: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Murder of Officer J.D. Tippit	Books	5	14	23	N	N	A MUST HAVE book for Kennedy Assassination buffs	No matter if you side with the lone assassin group, or the  conspiracy group, I highly recommend this book. The pictures and the maps are worth the price alone. I have read several other books, saying such and such person saw Oswald at this street, going in this direction, or no the other direction, and it is quite confusing. The author has easy to follow maps, and  a lot of photos of the people involved. Top quality paper, binding, and cool looking dustcover. Did Oswald kill Kennedy? And did he have any help?  Well, I'll not even go there, as I'm sure you have made up your mind on that subject. However, I see no way after reading this book, you could think anyone besides Oswald killed Tippit. The Author does go overboard on Tippit being a good cop, and a good family man.  In fact he states &quot;good cop&quot; so many times, you feel like he is talking about his dog &quot;good boy good boy&quot; - Besides this, he is  open minded about the witnesses changing their stories over the years, or making things up that never happened. Before you read this book, you may want to get a copy of..... We Saw Lincoln Shot One Hundred Eyewitness Accounts.. from those who witnessed the horror at Fords Theater 4/14/65. Its very interesting how the first reports of what happened in 1865 change, and are embellished by the time the last witness tells his story in the 1950s. In reading that book, I believe a person can grasp a better understanding of the Tippit killing, and how so many people can see the same thing, and tell a complete different story.	2003-11-24

I found this book to be quite enjoyable.  A lot of work has gone into this.  There are a few mistakes, but I'm sure these can and will be corrected, in a 2nd printing.  If your a Stooge fan, this book is a must.  The only real complaint I have, (reason why I didn't give five stars) is that the pages are SO paper thin, you have to be careful with the book, to prevent a page from tearing. I would rather have paid $60 for a hardback copy, with top quality paper.  I hope this will be considered if another edition is printed. You will enjoy this book almost GUARANTEED, but I wanted to forewarn you about the paper being telephone book style.	2003-11-17

Easy to follow, but very detailed. Great pictures. I have also read Blood On The Moon by Mr. Steers, and this work is first class also.  Dr. Mudd was lucky Andrew Johnson released him. If he had not  helped fellow prisoners and guards recover from Yellow fever, he would have deserved to remain in prison for life, and Dr. Mudd should get credit for that.  The Mudd family should be glad he didn't get what he deserved - the gallows next to Mary Surratt!	2003-08-25

This is the third book of Mr. Steers I have read, and although each book overlaps a little on the subject, I would recommend all of his books.	2003-08-25

I bought this book the same day as Edward Steers other book  - His name is still Mudd - and thought, oh no I've bought two book close to the same subject, when I should have only bought one.  Not only were both books very different and interesting,  but I found a third book by Mr. Steers - Blood On The Moon.  I would suggest buying all three, or start off with this one first, and if your as impressed as I was, I would look into buying the other two books.	2003-08-25
US	42362655	R1747LQWN6SR8R	0804006164	870612920	Suicide Or Murder?: The Strange Death Of Governor Meriwether Lewis	Books	5	11	12	N	Y	A TRUE MYSTERY	Anyone who is interested in the Lewis and Clark expedition, it is a must to have this book as a supplement. Anyone who likes to  'try' and figure out: mystery, truth from lies, to folklore, will also enjoy this book. This book gives all the accounts known of Meriwethers death. The problem is, there are about 20 accounts, and all of them differ, and the one person who we know for sure that was present - told at least four different versions. After reading this book, you will understand why some writers think it was murder,  some suicide, and some haven't a clue. I happen to lean to the side of murder, but I could also understand the next reader thinking it was suicide. In the beginning of this book, Vardis Fisher says - To the memory of Meriwether Lewis, the greatest American of his breed and the most neglected. I thought the statement was pretty dumb, but my the time I finished reading the book, I understood what he meant.	2003-04-06

It was well written, and I will have to agree with the other reviewer, the first part is the best. Rumbelow did a wonderful and skillful job in setting the mood for the things to come. He also does a great job in going into detail about the murders.  However, as later writers have pointed out, he uses a lot of secondary sources, like made up newspaper accounts, and fiction from some of the early writers of Jack the Ripper. It's a good book to begin with, but don't believe everything in the book as being pure fact.  The fact is, some of the sources he used were bad, or he only viewed them and then they vanished. It is still a very good book.  However, I would suggest Jack the Ripper the complete history by Philip Sugden, over this one.	2003-04-01

Warning: There are a lot of really bad books out there on Jack the Ripper, and there are some really good ones.  I suggest a great starting place would be - The Complete History of Jack the Ripper by Philip Sugden. When I finished reading Sugden's book, I thought wow no one will be able to top this. Sugden's book tells the story perfectly, and alerts the reader to all the myth's, and made up stories that have been told in book and newspaper's  form since 1888, he sticks to the facts.  Now, at the end of his book,  he list possible supects and goes into great detail. If you read the section on George Chapman in Sugden's book, and you come to the belief that he is by far the best suspect, then you should for sure buy \\"Alias Jack the Ripper\\" - I think you will come away from this book really thinking there is a better chance for him to be the Ripper than anyone. He was always at the right place, at the right time. The main reason people do not believe he is the Ripper is because- he was convicted of poisoning 3 wifes, and a serial killer would not change modes from a knife to poison.  Don't believe me, believe the best authority - \\" A man who could watch his wifes being slowly tortured to death by poison, as he did. was capable of anything...\\" Inspector Frederick Abberline, 1903	2003-04-01
US	42362655	R25EKXB1SIERVH	0786701242	975995627	The Complete History of Jack the Ripper	Books	5	1	1	N	N	It Doesn't get any better than this	The average review for this book is five stars. That is rare, but I understand why. I have read about 15 books on Jack the Ripper. There are a few really good books out there like Jack the Ripper A to Z, but if someone asked me what would be the best Ripper book, it would be this one. I would also buy it in Hardback if you can get it for a good price. If you have read this book and come to the conclusion that George Chapman has the best chance of being the Ripper ( which Sugden does a great job in giving only facts, not his personal opinion), I would then buy a copy of Alias Jack the Ripper	2003-04-01

Mrs. Cornwell did a good job in telling her story and in giving her views.  I think she has proved that Sickert probably sent several of the ripper letters. However, sending a letter and taunting the police seems like a sick joke Sickert would enjoy playing. As far as him being the Ripper that's a joke. I suggest picking this book up if you can get it for a buck or two. However, if your wanting the straight story you won't find a better book than - The Complete History of Jack The Ripper by Philip Sugden. By the way,  Mrs. Cornwall has been buying Sickerts paintings. If she can make people believe this man was Jack the Ripper - what an investment.	2003-03-26

This book pretty much tells how the first rock 'n' roll band got started. Even surprises like the FBI trying to find dirt on Haley, because Hoover was a racist and didn't want blacks to mingle with whites during concerts. One concert Haley made them remove a rope that was segregating crowds. This is only one of many things I found interesting in this book.  No doubt Elvis was the king, but as you read this book, you will understand why Haley is the true founding father of rock 'n' roll! - there are two books out about Haley, and both are very good, but this one goes a little deeper.	2002-08-28
