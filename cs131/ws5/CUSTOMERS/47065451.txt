Buchan, famously known (?) for penning \\"39 steps\\" -later filmed by Hitchcock- was obviously a gifted author and the Powerhouse is a convincing testament to that.    Measuring just under 100 pages, it's a novel that mixes in world-wide conspiracy, man-hunting, shady and ultra-powerful behind the scene characters.    It comes mostly across as a run of the mill crime story though as it reaches its conclusion and that is the downside about it.    That in itself comes in contrast with the beginning of the story, where the novel seems to develop an almost DeLillo feeling to it. As the protagonist of the story meets a dark figure of power intent of realising a bold plan of ruling the world with his secret-society-like group the expectations rise.  But only for the whole thing to \\"mellow down\\" to a much simpler story increasingly fast.    However, odds are that if someone recommends you this book it will be precisely for the dialogue between these two characters once they meet. That's where Buchan is at his best, and it's strange really, but yes, it is a book worth that conversation alone.    Other than that, it might be plausible to imagine that other novels of his are more intricate and complete, and a better place to start from.	2005-07-21

If you're not planning to do it the hard way, i.e do some heavy reading on German history combined with living in Germany for a long time, this book should suffice in providing you with some serious insights on the country, its people, and their psyche. <br /> <br />Written from the perspective of someone who did live there for many years (while doing some intense travelling within Germany) as well as having a German wife, Ardagh rpoves to be a more than adequate source. His biggest asset is that he's an excellent researcher not to mention a very accurate observer. <br /> <br />What this book basically covers is the post-war Germany. It picks it up starting with the immense difficulties the Germans faced in re-establishing a country laid in ruins and an economy in shambles,. It then proceeds on to how the Germans reached what is by now known as the \\"deutsche wunder\\" , and how the whole process coupled with the denazification and distancing from a troubled past reshaped the German folk and life in general. <br /> <br />   While all this is basically presented in a summarily fashion it still gives you an efficient backround as you move on the 70s and further all the way to the fall of the Berlin wall. <br />   Intriguingly, Ardagh does a region by region analysis too which should provide you with a good glimpse on the quite different peoples that share nationlity but vary in mentality, demeanor and customs if not ethics. <br /> <br />Perhaps his strongest chapter is the one covering the former East Germany and the reunification. While the 40 or so pages dedicated to this will surely not be enough, they will still give you a good overview on life under \\"socialism\\" and the surreal logistical (and other) problems as the 2 forcibly divided nations became again one in the 90s with the collapse of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br />   Ardagh isa good writer who backs up convincingly his analysis and often uses humor to entice and enhance his observations. Having myself lived inGermany for several years i think this is one of the best books on the subject. <br />   If one thing did \\"bother\\" me is his somewhat shallow analysis of the politics involved. But then again this is not what i was looking for when i bought the book. On every other aspect it was more than fulfilling, and to this, as an extra argument,  i add the numerous things i learned by reading it even though i've spent a big part of my life here and had still not discovered them. <br /> <br />	2005-07-19

There's several published accounts of cases such as his, mostly those be from the former Soviet Union. <br /> <br />Besides the obvious fact that this account being from extremely-isolated North Korea has intense interest, his book draws many parallels to the Soviet gulag stories. <br />K.Chol-Hwan's family was basically lured back to N.Korea from Japan where they were leading a very prosperous life, a lure made easier partly because his mother was ideologically a \\"communist\\". Despite the reservations of the rest of the family they relocated to N.Korea where they were supposed to help in the \\"revolution\\" and the \\"development\\" of the country. <br /> <br />Instead, they found themselves in a backwards isolated environment, a personal cult under Kim Jong-il, and a system that may call itself \\"communist\\" but is nothing more than a hardcore dictatorship. Hwan's account relates how slowly but steadily they were forced to give up their wealthy possessions, and how they discovered that the definition of being \\"reactionary\\" is quite open in that country, not only that, but it could land you in some seriously uncomfortable places. <br /> <br />Like for example, one of the countries numerous concentration camps, Yodok.  <br /> <br />Hwan, along with his entire immediate family (!) find themselves incarcerated in that hard-labour camp, where descriptions of appaling conditions abound. Inmates resort to eating bugs, frogs and rats. The sanitary conditions are as close to pure horror as it gets, inmates are punished for the slightest of pretenses, death looms heavy in all kinds of forms, and hope may die last but for most of the incarcerated that doesn't take long either. <br />Daily and downright hilarious but force-fed propaganda is the order of the day, and the inmates find themselves in a micro-world of incredible absurdity, brutality and darkness. <br /> <br />He and his family spent an unbearable 12 years in Yodok, and after that they were miraculously and unexpectedly released. Certainly more miraculous is the fact that they lived at all.  <br /> <br />After a short spell where Hwan tries to lead a \\"normal\\" life in the outside, he desides that wherever efforts he invests are basically pointless considering the increasingly worsening situation in the country, a situation that can at best be described as utterly hopeless for millions of N.Koreans. His plan to escape goes through some obstacles and close calls, but it eventually succeeds, and via China he finds himself in South Korea, N.Korea's \\"hated enemy\\".  <br /> <br />   After a period where he relates his story to the authorities who seek as much information as they could possibly get, he becomes an overnight celebrity of sorts, complete with countless interviews, lectures etc, all of course accompanied by a handsome income that his new-found status creates. <br /> <br />Perhaps predictably, Hwan comes short to declaring this a paradise. There in lays naturally the weakness of the book. While his account before his escape is not exactly a literary masterpiece (dry, colorless, even if intense and emphatic in all its horror and misery) , Hwan's understanding of the world is lobsided to say the least. He captures easily the obvious, dramatic and excruciating  failures of N.Korea but fails equally to capture those in the new system where he's found refuge. <br /> <br /> This in itself is also not rare. It does undermine the book as a whole in my opinion, but not his account of Yodok which must be read if only to discover to what limits humans can display bestiality.	2005-07-11

Books about science: for the majority of them, the layman reader will either be overwhelmed, bored, or both. Regardless of the topic, may that be evolution, the string theory, astronomy, you name it.  <br />This one here is decidingly different. It is so, because of the uncanny talent of the author to present one big and complex theory written almost laid back , with very creative style, one that grabs you and doesnt let go, first page to last. <br /> <br />   H.Bloom had a formidable task ahead of him as he started his book. His theory alone was such that he needed to time-travel with the reader, while deviating in such diverse sectors as history, biology, psychology, sociology. All in a book's work. <br /> <br />   Bloom claims that evolution's crucial leaps are based on the collective mind of a species and how it adapts, predicts and organises its society members in various situations. That's a controversial view to begin with as many evolutionists dont abide to this thought. <br /> <br />   But Bloom does a tremendous job in not only the way he lays forth his expansive arguments but very convincingly showing that his arguments thoroughly work. <br />   Bloom's thesis was in desperate need of strong paradigms from the get-go and he provides them in abundance. He shifts through the microbe and bacteria world to show that the incredible adaptiveness and survivability of these micro-organisms is due to their ability to \\"work\\" as a mass mind. The chapter on this is one of the most fascinating of the book. <br /> <br />   Bloom knew all too well, that bacteria alone wouldn't do the trick. Nor would his examples of certain monkey species which owe their survival to pure imitation be ebough, examples which also include elephants and other species as well. <br /> <br />   The big question for the naysayers was could he prove his point concerning the human species as well? In reality, even if Bloom hadn't included the human species at all in his thesis his case is close as it comes to shut-tight. <br />   Concerning humans then, Bloom goes way back to the mountains of Sparta and its hardcore principles of weeding out the \\"weak\\" compared to those of Athens which kept a place for mostly everyone through a much more liberal system. From there on he progresses effortlessly towards modern times and doesn't lose a note in his effort. The final frontier is of course the internet, which Bloom claims is our biggest high-tech bid of mass mind processing. It becomes almost sci-fi by then (it certainly is pure reality of course) and it's a bombastic closing for a book that starts out in fascinating fashion and ends just in the same manner if not more so. <br /> <br />    In the end, and as you reach the final chapter, you have the intense impression that you've had a hyper-exciting chat with a very insightful human being. Reading this book isn't simply a pleasure because of the comfortable and inviting style in which it is written but mainly because you emerge a more expanded mind by the time you're done. The charisma of Bloom to make you \\"think big\\" is beyond any question. He elevates you to great heights and makes you see life from way up there while thrusting you through many dimensions of reality, micro or macro. <br /> <br />    I can go on and on, about why this is is one of the most important books on the market right now, but i hope the point has been laid out clearly enough. The hype preceeding this book and which started with the previous one (The Lucifer principle) is obviously 100% justified.	2005-05-30

You dont have to be aiming at a future record deal to be interested in such a book. Even as an avid music fan you will find information and inside knowledge here that will enlighten you in the mysterious and more often than not wicked ways the music industry works. <br /> <br />   It's a great eye-opener then, one that will obviously be more useful to musicians who are either looking forward to getting a deal or were not satisfied in their initial one. Written by a producer with years-long experience in the business, it provides crucial info on what to be careful about concerning: <br /> <br />-contracts and the various angles one should be careful in order to avoid a bad deal (a story often read about concerning groups or solo artists). <br />-differences in signings between majors and indie labels. An in-depth analysis on the difference between an indie label and a major. <br />-an explanation on the finances of such deals. <br />-copyright and sampling analysis.  <br /> <br />The above are just headlines of course, as each chapter is very comprehensive and covers to a very adequate degree the subject it deals with. Written in simple language so that all the legal mumbo-jumbo becomes understandable for the layman, and with a healthy dose of humour and cynicism to drive the various points home, it's a great book to go through. Categorised according to subject for easy and simple reference.  <br /> <br />    \\"Confessions of a Record Producer\\" demolishes a lot of myths about the music business and reshapes certain false sources of ill-gotten optimism that new musicians nurture and which lead them into well-documented traps. What in fact is introduced here first and foremost is hardcore realism. Without that element anyone entering in negotiations with the music industry is a sheep among wolves.	2005-04-15

All i really aimed for was getting an insightful account on how living in a medieval city would be and had no idea how an author would go about presenting this. <br /> <br />Having mentioned that, \\"Life in a Medieval City\\" exceeded my expectations and then some! It's a brilliant and carefully detailed book on how the every day routine rolled around the 11th century in the city of Troyes in France. <br /> <br />The authors touch basically all aspects of life in a medieval city: commercial, religious, every day tasks, challenges and difficulties, education, military defense, you name it. <br /> <br />It's definetely not overwhelming as some reviewers claimed because the authors do not bore tzhe reader with the unnecessaryas the delve into the various sectors of medieval life. The style is very direct, very modern and very comprehensive.  <br /> <br />The bits of information to be obtained from it are absolutely remarkable and i finished this book pleased that i had a fresh set of questions about medieval life based on the knowledge i acquired by reading it. This is anyway the value standard a good book should be measured by.  <br /> <br />Easily one of the most pertinent books on the subject. <br />	2005-03-06

It wouldnt be unfair to say that the \\"Waiting Period\\" is probably best meant for Selby's more dedicated fans. <br /> <br />It's an excellent idea that this novel is based on, one that should have served for a terrific platform for Selby to unleash his relentless narrative style as well as his unique mind but this simply fails to be the case. <br /> <br />As Selby lets us live into the mind of a veteran soldier turned killer and allows us to be privy to all his sinister thoughts and evil plotting as he plans and schemes about his victims it seems initially that this will be an immensely gripping book. <br /> <br />And it is for a while too. <br /> <br />But because this is basically a silent monologue it doesnt keep you hostage for too long. The story becomes too mono-dimensional and as the variables do not change and no other characters are introduced except for the killer himself it starts loosening its grip until you're 3/4s into the book and you're basically forcing yourself to read on. <br /> <br />That's still remarkable in itself because i dont see how any other author could keep you reading for as far as that with an idea as underdeveloped as that. But that's Selby and his way of laying out a bizzare and abysmally dark narrative in every book he's brought forth. This narrative of his is the only thing memorable here though. <br /> <br />If you are not familar with this outstanding author start with his classic \\"Last exit to Brooklyn\\". If you do i can easily see how you might be tempted to read \\"Waiting Period\\".  <br />It still holds together enough for a good dark novel. But without the fanship factor it loses much of its appeal. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-06

This is an interesting approach this book follows as it introduces philosophy in everyday life through a series of actions (\\"experiments\\" the author calls them). <br /> <br />   It's all divided into 101 very short chapters thematically categorised. Examples include: <br />-Empty a word of its meaning <br />-Play with a child <br />-Encounter pure chance <br />-Take the tube without going anywhere <br />-Play the fool <br />-Follow the movements of ants <br />-Come across a childhood toy <br />-Try not to think <br />-Be aware of yourself speaking <br /> <br />Several of these philosophical experimentations are probably things everyone has thought about at some point. The author collects them all, emphasizes, dwells, goes the sep further as he invents new ones or comes up with betetr versions of known older ones. <br /> <br />   It might sound like the way a child discovers philosophy, but, bearing in mind that most people stay at that level of awareness most their lives the book actually hits its target convincingly. It's a fun and for the most part surprisingly trippy reading even for those who consider themselves a bit ahead philosophically. That is mainly due to the ability of Roger-Pol Droit to keep you intrigued as you progress through his book. <br /> <br />   Many of the concepts he discusses have been through our minds occasionally but we let them \\"escape\\" without placing the appropriate attention on them. There's a lot to be thought about by looking at the activity of an ant colony or even by watching dust in the sun (other microscopic worlds). <br />   Concepts like these can only lead you forward to other more advanced personal researches. Which is exactly the point of course.  <br />    Moreover, Roger-Pol Droit's book is one you'll probably come back to every now and again as is impossible to actually try out the things in it that interest you most in one go. <br /> <br />	2005-01-20

As substance induced psychedelia became almost a sweeping religion in the 60s certain great minds emerged that tried to conceptualise the goings on of that era and form them into new philosophies made of an amalgam of Eastern teachings, ancient western cosmotheories and modern realisations.        Among the many in that effort was T.Leary. Most of his books are known to the lay public as nothing more than acid-promotion but the truth is that they are excellent philosophical endeavours of the trippiest kind.        \\"Your brain is god\\" is a primary example of that. Allthough a mere 100 pages it summarises emphatically the vision those 60s luminaries had for ourselves. To realise that we are, or can be, gods. A much misunderstood concept to be sure, but one that has enormous merit in it not in an anthropocentric sense but more from a \\"know thyself\\" point of view.        Knowing thyself is of course no simple matter (if it were we wouldnt be on the verge of self-extinction). There have been many approaches and many philosophies over the eons that have tried to accomplish just that with various degrees of success. Leary came to that \\"field\\" through the confrontation with one's one brain that certain substances can provoke. His realisations might not sound like new discoveries to those few that are well philosophy-broken but his style and his way of formulating his beliefs are almost inimitable.         There's more to be taken from this book of Leary's than from many other bulky tomes that well known philosophers have written. Because, make no mistake here, he was unquestionably a philosopher and a darn good one. Leary has a  way of condensing things in a modern 20th century type of way that will intrigue even the more focus-challenged out there.        My favorite quote from this book, is one that you can write a whole new book about in itself:  \\"...the smarter you become the smarter your world becomes\\".        A great \\"lil\\" book for those that are never content with the number of doors opened in their minds.       One objection that some might have is the later chapters of the book when Leary is basically giving out methodology on the use of acid. This is the time he comes from and this is the path he used. This though, does in no way mean that he promotes it as an absolute path. Life isnt one street. It would anyway be totally hypocritical of him to omit those chapters when he was known as the acid-guru. You should simply concentrate on taking out what's valuable for you, whatever that might be. And there's a lot of that here.	2005-01-01

Moreover the subjects were not aware if, when, and how the influencer was going to attempt to influence them. Yet the results were always impressively succesful. Speaking of those results they will undoubtedly be very annoying to the hordes of deniers in the scientific community.<br /><br />The implications put serious questions (as well as some sizeable dents) in many of the currently accepted theories. While all this will not be any news to many independent researchers or honest scientists who arent interested in an ill-perceived \\"reputation\\", it is a very important step in finally coming to terms with the fact that there's more than meets the eye concerning interconnectedness and even more than we think happens in our dimension.<br /><br />As to the book it might be tiring for some readers since it's focused more on the technical side of the experiments and less so on the implications or even the explanations of the results. This is in a way understood since the explanations aren't fully grasped yet. And I'm using the word \\"fully\\" quite vaguely here. The authors are more concentrated in presenting the scientific properness of the experiments and making sure the science thereof cant be questioned than actually dealing with what their showings imply. Obviously an extra tome would be needed for the latter and one should remember that there's several books on the market (albeit widely ignored) that do deal with this aspect.<br /><br />Overall, if you belong among those who've accepted what these experiments prove as fact long before they took place this book will be invaluable in your arsenal when you are faced with stubborn and myopic argumentators who insist on living in a microscopic and boring world.

Colin Andrews calls himself the world's leading authority when it comes to crop circles and I wouldn't contest that -simply because i wouldn't know how- but the lingering question after reading his immensely interesting book is this: <br />-if the top authority on this phenomenon has no definite answer about what causes it after 20 long years of intense research we might start developing some cautious \\"pessimism\\" that we're a long way from the answer. <br /> <br />   That having been said, this is a very good book on the subject albeit certain points that deserve critique. <br /> <br />    Collins tries to condense all the information he has in a rather short book. The several theories about the causes are all listed and somwehat summarily explored, as are Collins's own speculations about it all. The book has numerous crop circle photographs as well (many of them spectacular). <br /> <br />   Collins tries to put to rest the aging matter of whether crop circles are man made or not by sayign that his reserach has led him to believe that a whooping 80% of them are indeed man-made. This leaves of course 20% of them unexplained and this in turn is a huge number considering that there have been 1000s of crop circles reported and/or recorded around the world. If one considers that crop circles have been reported from time immemorial then the mystery deepens. <br /> <br />    The crop circle phenomenon is in certain respects even more intriguing than the UFO one itself. One has the eerie feeling that a certain intelligence is trying to tell us something. If that would be true the implications are are of course of paramount importance. But even if that is not the case, still, any explanation holds tremendous interest. If one looks at certain crop circles, especially ones that have not been explained away as man-made, he will find it extremely difficult to explain them as geophysical phenomena exactly because of their sheer geometrical complication. <br /> <br />   Collins does emphasize (i had the feeling) the gaia theory, a theory that professes that the earth is a living organism in itself and it has the ability to provide messages or \\"signs\\" when it is in danger. Very interesting indeed but even more difficult to support than that of the extraterrestrial interference. <br /> <br />    There's various books out there about this subject and this one here is no bad place to start by any means. My notion is that one would serve himself well if he went on reading what other researchers have to say aboiut this all. What is certain is that no researcher -so far- has definite evidence about what he speculates as being the explanation. But that being the case it makes it all the more \\"obligatory\\" to entertain all available theories.	2004-12-26

I bought this book hoping to get a view on how the Japanese soldiers experienced the war in Burma and war in general, but more importantly i was hoping for a different view than the one we are \\"accustomed\\" to through books written by Westerners.        The western market is saturated with such books describing experiences from various wars and times, but when i searched in Amazon i found only a handful translated into english and written by Asians.       In that regard i was surprised to see that most of the content of the book could've been written by a Westerner as well. There are, naturally, several accounts in the 60 and over stories included that do provide an insight into the Japanese psyche but they arent the majority.       One prevailing element is that most of the authors of the stories are very cynical in their desciptions, but in strange matter of fact way. They describe very scholastically what the situation was but as if from the eye of a distant observer.       Is this a worthy read generally speaking? Absolutely. Even if some of the stories are paradoxically boring for being battle accounts most are nothing less than gripping. There is one story in particular,  that stood out in my mind where a japanese soldier not only narrates a harrowing account of a very ritical battle in Burma but also provides sketches he did in order to describe the horrors he witnessed. These sketches along with the accompanying descriptions will stay on your mind because of their sheer intensity.       Otherwise, this book is also very interesting from a military point of view as it provides a historical account of the difficulties and hardships as well as the strategical approaches of the Japanese during the war in Burma..        Another thing that is amongst the more noteworthy things here is that the Japanese would prefer suicide rather than fall into the hands of the enemy. Several such accounts are to be found in the book.       The last few stories are told by Japanesenurses and have a very special interest of their own.	2004-12-25

Have you by any chance read the \\"Midnight express\\" or seen the movie thereof? Thought it was pretty horrible? Well, actually, things can get a lot, and i mean a lot worse than that. <br /> <br />   In \\"The Damage Done\\" W.Fellows describes what can only be expressed as 12 undescribable years in a Bangkok prison complete with every human degredation you could possibly think of. Indeed, as i kept reading through his book it seemed to me as if i was reading about an experiment intended to test the absolute limits of human endurance by imposing the most horrifying conditions under incarceration. Certain experiences described by the author will be hard to stomach even for those way above the average of composure.  <br /> <br />   It's hard to even begin to imagine how anyone could survive this with his life let alone be in a relatively stable mental conditions afterwards. Imagine for example being forced to stand in a sewer neck-high. For several minutes that will probably seem like centuries. Imagine as well if you had to resort to eating the roaches of your cell as your only protein source. Sounds bad enough? It's only a mere few of the surreal moments this person endured in his 12 years in prison. <br /> <br />   Fellows is fully aware of how many people view him since he'd been convicted as a heroin smuggler. But the question hanging from every page of his book is whether anyone is deservant of such treatment. Whether 12 years of incarceration are alone not enough..He doesnt directly answer himself. But you surely will after being through with his book. In one way or the other. <br /> <br />   What is perhaps more interesting than the limits of human endurance that you'll inevitably have to consider is the limits of human sadism. I've pondered often myself on this and no matter what answer i came up with it's always been a disturbing one. Human saidsm is one side of our species that leaves very little doubt about how doomed we are. What we can do to other human beingsis exactly what we are capable of doing and ARE doing to everything around us. And everything around us will not tolerate us for much longer, that seems to me a certainty. <br /> <br />    Fellow's book, like basically any book written about a person's experience in prison is ultimately not about being locked up and only. It's about us. It's a harsh relentless look at what we are or what we can be. Not a nice picture by any means. In an ideal world this could be a wake-up call. But we're pretty far from an ideal world and even further from waking up. <br /> <br />   So then, things being as they are, do what's offered. Read about the horrors we are capable of inducing on others. Attempt to do something incredible: think. This much we owe to ourselves.	2004-12-03

This legendary book (and later movie of the same caliber) has provoked and is still provoking so much off the point debate that it's hard to fathom.         A discussion about Turkey and its pros and cons belongs either  in a different forum or upon a different book as a vehicle for argumentation. Even Hayes himself despite his martyrdom had said publicly after his escape to the States that his intention had never been a defamation of Turkey or the Turks. So lets leave it at that.       To the book itself, this is indeed a momumental reading describing the utter and surreal ordeal that Hayes, a convicted hash smuggler endured while incarcerated in the Turkish prison system. He describes a system which was designed (or left to its own devices?) to devalue human existence and destroy human dignity. In conditions mildly called appalling, Hayes went through 5 years of sheer soul and bodily torture until his incredible and unlikely escape which spared him life imprisonment.       He himself spares the reader none of all the disturbing details and descriptions as he unravels his nightmarish narrative. The Midnight Express is a book that punches hard at the incarceration system (as prisons in many other parts of the world are similar or worse) and the sheer disregard for human dignity. Credit to Hayes for not trying to redeem himself by claiming wrongful conviction. He accepts that he commited a crime according to that country's law and that he knew he was as he was commiting it. He doesnt accept (to put it again, VERY mildly) the severety of the penalty and the way it was carried out.        It's a book that will no doubt unnerve the reader who's unfamiliar with such literature or who's never given much thought to such issues. It's a scary experience even as an innocent turning of pages and will keep you hostage with its gloomy, borderline deathly and insane atmosphere. It will also provide some serious food for thought about the limits of human perseverence as a whole.Written in a very direct and engaging style, Hayes proved a talent in writting and if you've read other such books you know that not everyone could achieve the level of directness and the effect of making you feel other the way he did.         Worthy of its fame by any standard. For anyone interested in a similar and perhaps even more disturbing book try the \\"Damage done\\" by Warren Fellows.	2004-11-24

Like a few of the reviewers here i was totally unaware of the Boondocks until i got this collection and delved into it. <br /> <br />    Having said that, it was somewhat difficult to get into the mindset of this comic, primarily because of its idiosyncratic humour and because its characters have more depth compared to other comic strips in circulation. But once this was achieved, the Boondocks revealed itself for what it really is: an intelligent satire and critique from the black perspective, a perspective critically missing in this field which has been, for decades now, dominated by white artists. <br /> <br />   The main characters are 2 black kids who move in with their grandpa in an uptown neighborhood from their former ghetto domains. Moving neighborhoods though proves a task as the 2 kids do not forget their old ways, and thus the issue of racial identity is addressed. Inevitably, hiphop enters the picture and countless references to contemporary black culture cleverly intergrated into the strip. <br /> <br />    If the Boondocks do have something which is questionable is whether it always maintains a constancy in its level of humour. I'd say that it doesn't, at least not in this collection, and that's something i kept noticing while going through it. The compensation for this is of course more than adequate becuase as I said above this comic strip is a tough well disguised critique and commentary on racial issues, racial cliches and stereotypes, issues many people would either not touch or remain hopelessly clueless about.  <br /> <br />    Well drawn with a very distinctive style at times, the Boondocks is a much needed addition in the realm of social commentary comics (if this term ever applied as most comics aim at that, but few achieve it)...	2004-11-08

A seemingly ordinary person working mostly in construction sites, is given a bizzare opportunity to make some fast and good money. He's offered more than he'd make working in 2-3 months to follow an accountant for several days in his everyday life and report what he discovers to a shadowy figure who obviously has some even more shadowy scores to settle. <br /> <br />    He does so, but as it so often happens in life the situation starts taking some weird twists unforeseen by him and by his instructors. This ordinary person sudenly finds himself becoming murderer and then a fugitive as the deals he's put together have not come through. <br /> <br />    But lo and behold because all this happens in the first half of the book. From then the story takes a turn for the surreal and brutal as the protagonist of the book gets captured and goes through what can only be described as utter hell. You'll have a pretty difficult time forgetting the latter part of the book let alone even reading it if you happen to not be gifted with a strong stomach.   <br />    This is story written in excellent pace and with nicely distributed touches of humour, cynicism and brio by an author who obviously has tremendous potential. Charles Higson has no limitations about the stretches he gives his story and you're constantly in for new surprises as you progress in the story. In a new generation of authors who are bringing forth the uglier side of human nature in a society governed by the warped ethics of the money-god and the relentless effort of people to survive regardless of what this might involve. Great stuff. <br />	2004-11-07

The clear advantage Howarth's book has over the many written of the famous D-Day on the 6th of June 1944 is that he tells the story through the testimonies of those that survived, but from both sides. Yes, there are way more accounts included from the allied soldiers compared to their German opponents, but the German account-element is there as well and it's what gives you a more spherical view on how those who were there experienced that monumental day. <br /> <br />    For students of military history not well or not all acquainted with the Normandy story, there's much to be discovered through this book. First of all the collosal size of the operation, unparallel until that day and since. Thousands of ships as well as planes carried tremendous numbers of infantry and marines, as well as tanks to the shores of Normandy in an attempt to critically shift the balance in the war towards the Allies. Alone the logistic considerations were beyond imagination and a failure in that sector would've resulted in unbelievable disaster. There were, to a degree such failures but not to a level which would have devestated the attackers.  <br /> <br />    Then the tactical planning itself, an issue all on its own, an issue on which Howarth does an exceptional job informing the reader but without tiring him in the manner other military historians often do by overwhelming him with numbers and codes. This is not the approach he takes as he aims more to inform those not so much interested in the microdetails of the operation. <br /> <br />    Even more interesting, and possibly the least known aspect of that operation, was the undertaking of misinforming and confusing the Germans about where and when the attack would take place. A formidable task when one considers how difficult it was to keep a massive assault of that type disguised from enemy intelligence and, more importantly, to even throw them off trail. <br /> <br />    As the book reaches the attack itself everything comes alivein its pure horror dimensions. Unexpected failures that resulted in unexpected situations and countless victims. The despair of the German defenders as they discover the apparently hopeless situation they are in with zero airforce support and being pummeled initially by the naval artillery as well as bombed heavily by both American and British planes only to see 1000s of soldiers following to the shores. Still, what commenced was a merciless battle that resulted in piles of bodies in the water, in the sand dunes, in the trences, everywhere. <br /> <br />    A book worthy of the event it describes, well written, impeccably researched and accessible to the layman but equally interesting to the specialised reader as well. <br />	2004-11-07

It's there now, and it will be a useful tool in the neverending debate on the subject. <br />   <br /> Author Matthew Hurley has done a meticulous effort trying to gather depictions in classic art (paintings) which might be showing aliens or craft thereof. Such references have been, of course, made by other researchers in various books but never, up to now, has someone actually published a book with photographs of such paintings, let alone gone through the painstaking work of first assembling the big catalogue of paintings that contain such bizzare (?) depictions. <br /> <br />    In that respect, the book is a true gem. Most of the paintings it covers do originate from the rennasaince period and most are actually displayed in some of the world's biggest museums. The depictions on them that could be pointing to alien inspiration, or even, direct portrayal of an actual encounter, are for the most part impressive. Some could be, admittedly, perceived and interpreted in many ways, but some others (probably most) are so clearly not a part of the rest of the painting that one stands baffled looking at the image. <br /> <br />    In many cases it is literally as if the artist is \\"screaming\\" to us that, yes, what we are looking at is not connected with the actual painting, but it's his testimony of the unthinkable. <br /> <br />    Hurley's book is not a bulky affair, but it's packed with images and data many of which not even the most fanatic UFO buffs will be aware of. Hardcover, well illustrated, with several close-ups of the paintings in question, as well as quite a few that date back to the prehistoric era including statuettes. A must for those researching this field.	2004-11-07

James been able to write this book in a manner which was not polemic, not enervating, not preachy, not tiring to read, it would have 50 times the effect it anyway has plus he'd have way more allies than he actually does.<br /><br />  His argument is that Greek philosophy and sciences were not original at all, and that for the most part they were directly influenced (\\"stolen\\" as he puts it) by the Egyptians. Being that this is a very provocative and controversial point, he needs some seriously solid sources to support him. He does provide this support of his argument but not in a very convincing manner. He cites both ancient historians (mostly of Greek origin)as well as modern specialised historians (egyptologists) to achieve this.<br /><br />  Exactly there arises the first problem. For an issue of massive significance such as the one he raises this is a remarkably thin book barely spanning over 150 pages. Because of this, everytime he dismisses a greek philosopher or mathematician ,etc., he does this in a mere 5-10 pages simply by bombarding the reader by quotes from ancient and modern texts or accounts. This is the stly of the book for its entirety and in the end you have the feeling that you might be reading the most important telephone catalogue ever written.<br /><br />  This not only tires the reader incredibly but it also undermines the author himself. The concept is, of course, to motivate the reader to research this further himself by checking up on the sources the author provides. I very much doubt he achieves this goal. Only the extremely unbiased and those with loads of time in their hands might do that. The majority of the readers would rather prefer a much more expanded book with a lot more detail. The way George James' book is written anybody who wishes to remain with the \\"orthodox\\" version of history will do so thinking that  this book is simply equal to tabloid polemics.<br /><br />  The truth of the matter is that James does have an argument. To what extend this argument can carry its weight is still under debate, but it is a fact that the influence of the Egyptians upon the Greeks was immense. Being that the Egyptian system of philosophy and sciences was one that worked through levels of initiation and much less through documentation the picture that has prevailed is the one most people know about the Greek civilisation being the first that incorporated such an advanced level in those areas.<br /><br />  But advanced students of history know all too well that not only the Egyptians but the Chinese too (to name just two cultures) had achieved similar if not far superior levels in those fields. The reasons why the Greeks have been chosen as pioneers or forerunners of western civilisations are complex, intriguing, and in any case far more complicated than James argues.<br /><br />  Still, i consider this a horribly written book with a very important issue underneath the mess.<br /><br />  But there arises the second problem. In reality, it matters very little, or it should matter very little who first thought what, or who first invented what. James makes the same mistake as those he thinks he opposes. He has the same agenda as those he opposes because his argument is one of a racial backround. It's really irrelevant whether philosophy or sciences were first founded or solidified by white cultures, black cultures, or asian cultures. Human history has far less borders than some would want people to think.<br /><br />  As it is, this is yes an important book, a very faulty one simoultaneously, and one that fails to effectively raise the issue it advocates. Only people with a deep understanding over knowledge of history will see whichever value James's book has. Other than that, a rather wasted effort...ames does have an argument.

For the historically initiated the bombing of Dresden very late in WWII has never ceased to provide for immense controversy and debate as well as several books on the subject. Frederick Taylor's book is the latest attempt to set the record straight and examine once more the main point of the everlasting discussion about the Dresden bombardment: <br />was it \\"justified\\", did it really help in ending the war or shorten it to a respectable degree and how many people actually perished in the city ruins? <br /> <br />Strictly militarily speaking this can be, at least for some, a difficult question to answer. Noone can really speak in accurate terms about how much it actually did shorten the war. Those that advocate this point assess that the Germans had resorted to recruiting 1000s of under-18 \\"soldiers\\" in a desperate attempt to hold out. This alone, they insist could've prolonged the war for several more months if not longer and only a devastating blow directly aimed at the morale of the German population could've avoided this. Others claim that the allies had no way of knowing the real level of resistance the german army still had in its last gasp attempts to defend Germany.  <br /> <br />   Several historians however agree that the allies had enough intelligence to know that the end was a matter of time. Of very short time at that. The Russians were on the outskirts of Berlin and advancing steadily. The German army had suffered a devestating defeat in the West thus losing its last hope of delivering a big blow to the allied forces advancing from that direction. The German airforce was basically inexistent at that point. Same, to an extent, can be safely claimed of their navy.  <br /> <br />   Taylor, approaches the Dresden issue by giving the reader a comprehensive backround of the city, its history and its role culturally as well as militarily for Germany. In equal detail he informs the reader about the course of the war up until that point as well as the policies of the Nazi party in regard to recruiting all possible resources in order to win the war. He does an exceptional job outlining the history of air-warfare starting much further back until he reaches the mid 40s when that type of warfare became more sophisticated and therefore more devastating to human life.  <br /> <br />   Dresden became a horror story of tremendous loss of life in Dante-like conditions and indiscriminate destruction of a city which was considered a gem of architecture and culture. It was not the first destruction of its kind but possibly the most emphatic. Hamburg, Essen and Cologne had preceeded it among other cities. <br /> <br />    For those not familiar with what the people of Dresden went through in a range of 3 days the bombing lasted this book will be a jaw-dropping read. Thousands of tons of incindiary as well as explosive bombs were dropped by 100s of planes in a well devised manner everywhere in the city. The inhabitants tried to find shelter in the very inadequate shelters of the city only to be either crushed under collapsing buildings or burned alive in well planned fire-storms. <br /> <br />   The issue remains, even with this book hitting the store-shelves, how many people actually lost their lives during the 3 day ordeal. While other historians have claimed that the number actually surpassed 100.000 Frederick Taylor puts it somewhere between 25.000-30.000. The fact that the overwhelming majority of them were civilians (countless children amongst them) is of course undoubtable. <br /> <br />    It seems that Taylor's assessments are not very convincing <br />even if he goes to great lengths registering accounts from both sides. The only way one can reach a conclusion of his own is reading what other authors have to say on the subject and what sources and accounts they use for their claims. By doing that one finds that Taylor might actually be understating what actually happened, or, in any event, underestimated the results of Dresden's incredible destruction.  <br /> <br />   If however, this is not the outstanding point to you, Taylor's book will simply overwhelm you. The dimensions of horror that will jump at you from the pages of this book are beyond imagination. It really comes down to questioning human intelligence and the limits our brutality can reach in achieving goals. In that respect, main issue aside, this is a book you need to read.	2004-10-13

Having read quite some books written by C.Wilson, i know that going through the ones where he's conducting research is always a great experience.<br /><br />\\"The Occult\\" is famed for being probably the premiere book on its subject: the history of magic, its definitions, the paranormal, the limits of human powers and the analysis of the \\"hidden powers\\" humans possess, certain forays into specific areas (like clairvoyance, means to achieve it, etc.) , loads of examples from throughout history on people who've influenced this field, as well as a comprehensive review of views that prevail over all these areas.<br /><br />  This is without the slightest doubt a gripping book. Even if you have only a surface interest on all this, Wilson has a way of pulling totally into the matter, absorbing you and letting you get to the very depths of it.<br /><br />  But if you happen to actually care about this field -and it's indeed a field where imagination can really gallop wild- then this book is quintessential to start from.<br /><br />  The market is saturated with books that deal with the \\"occult\\" or specific areas of it, but before you should even bother with any of these you should start here. Alone the vast list of sources that will be introduced to you is enough to make the book nothing else than a treasure.<br /><br />  But its main asset is that Wilson approaches the subject with his usual hardcore seriousness and efficiency, and lets remember, this is a topic where charlatanism is often the rule. But it's the scientific approach that puts C.Wilson ahead of the pack. The gathering of evidence through exhaustive reading of anything regarding the issue, the evaluation of it, the personal analysis as well as that of others, the comparisons thereof, the analytical history of the subject.<br /><br />  I find it hard to believe that one would read this and emerge the same person.

There's things that bothered me about the concepts brought forward in this book and there were other sections in it that were really rewarding.       The author Uspenskii goes through a marathon of questions and answers with a journalist (or is it a member or members of the audience, this is not clear) displaying the main ideas of the \\"school\\" as they are concentrated in a system of life-approaches called \\"the way\\". This is, by the way, a bulky book spanning over 600 pages.       This concept is basically focused on self awareness even if this is expressed in different terms, which in turn is nothing new in its own as this has been explored by the Chinese, Egyptians and Greeks 1000s of years ago. What might (and that's a big \\"might\\") be new here is the way this is achieved as Uspenskii talks repeatedly about \\"remembering oneself\\" hence achieving a primary state of awareness and working your away into deeper states as you become more concious, or, as he puts it, \\"not alseep\\".         There's of course plenty of food of thought as he develops this idea to his questioner:  -he states that most people need or (wind up doing so )to lie numerous times a day since they are not knowledgeful for the most part about what they're talking about, therefore they talk conciously about things they dont know.  -lies are a further way of keeping someone asleep as he perceives himself and the world around him as something other than they really are.  -In any case noone \\"posseses\\" only one self but several selves that vie for dominance and become expressed in different occasions and circumstances. But there are also \\"fake\\" or negative or imaginative selves that can slowly set a stronghold in the inner world of someone and thus perpetuate the \\"sleep\\".        This, along with countless other ideas that are presented in the \\"4th way\\" are, indeed, tremendously interesting and could be used to develop oneself further into what one really is.       The problem with Uspenskii is that throughout the book he maintains with a passion that all this cannot under any circumstances be achieved without the help of the \\"school\\"   which is an institution set up by himself after the inspiration he received from Giurdiiev (the one who conceived this whole philosophy).        This, in my mind, is a terribly stretched point, if not a rather suspicious one. There's no reason why someone could not achieve awareness on his own (people have done it to certain degrees for ages) especially when Uspenskii does a very unconvincing job explaining why someone would needthe \\"school's\\" help. There's several examples of people, who, yes, seeked \\"help\\" or inspiration in outer sources but did not need to attend a \\"school\\". As there are examples of the opposite too.    He's asked about this several times in the book and his answers are always vague and evasive. Another quite obvious contradiction, is that, while Uspenskii basically advocates detachment and non-identification with anything, he asks in reality that one identifies with the school, for how could one arrive to the belief that he needs a school without identifying with the idea that alone he's useless in that cause?        In any case, even with this rather dodgy occurence in his layout,  Uspenskii does present a very insightful concept albeit one that could, in popular terms, be called a \\"best-of ancient philosophies\\".        The ideas presented by this Russian philosopher are definitely deep-cutting and can become very powerful tools in one's effort to evolve. Recommended but not for those who have a weak spot for being dominated by someone else's world.	2004-09-07

While the war in continental Europe takes the lion's share in military bibliography the one that raged in the Pacific was certainly as ruthless and gripping. <br /> <br />   That happens a rather unknown fact especially to Europeans, and this book does a tremendous job bringing to the surface the horrors that took place in one of the bloodiest and most strategic battles in the Pacific theater, that of the island of Tarawa. <br /> <br />   Heavily fortified by the Japanese and invaded by a massive marine force the island was bound to become a huge burial ground as over 6000 soldiers from both sides died within a mere 3 days. <br /> <br />   Of these, an incredible 99.7% of the Japanese force were casualties (only about 20 survived and were taken prisoners) while the losses on the American side were stunningly big as well. That of course does not include the numerous injured soldiers that left parts of their bodies on Tarawa. <br /> <br />    Aside the heavy Japanese fortification, the island presented another formidable problem to the invading force, that of the coral reef that surrounded it. Armored amphibious vehicles were used to surpass that obstacle but the results were less than great as these became target practice for the Japanese machine-gunners ashore. It only got more grim every time a hatch-door opened and marines rushed out to open water having to go an excruciatingly long 200-400 yards till they reached land while under fire from the defenders.  <br /> <br />   In the end, and as several accounts describe, the waters around the island were filled with 100s of floating face-down corpses from the fallen. <br /> <br />    The Americans tried to initially bomb the \\"rikusentai\\" (Japanese marine commandos) out of their positions prior to the assault but to little avail, and the battle of Tarawa that ensued became a hand to hand combat as well as a bullet festival from surreally close ranges. As the Japanese defenders were not going to give in until death, themassacre was but a certainty. <br /> <br />   The author (a retired marine himself), is at sometimes too scholarly, aiming to the specialised military reader as well as the non-military, but overall he does an overwhelmingly good job in bringing forth the bleak details and the planning of the attack. <br /> <br />   His description includes all the frantic \\"beyond the battle\\" situations (the problems the commanders faced aboard the ships or directly in battle, and these were many). His best comes when he deals with the battle itself where he literally puts you there in a narrow space with death looming everywhere. <br /> <br />   Most of the core of the book is yet another reminder of what war really is and \\"Utmost savagery\\" is definitely a must-read for studiers of WWII history.  <br /> <br />   If you belong to that group, and you've mostly focused your reading in the war in Europe this is a book that will easily shift your attention from that front and remind you in its fullest scale why it was actually a world war.  <br /> <br />    Gripping, harrowing account of one of the most merciless battles in contemporary history.	2004-09-04

An endeavour like this is bound to have its benefits and flaws. Some artists who in retrospect proved not as influential or heavy in importance wind up having extensive coverage while others might get no mention at all or very little of it.  <br /> <br />It's all more a matter of perspective of course and having read other encyclopedias of the sort i know that this is the case with basically all of them. <br /> <br />    With this then intentionally overlooked, this book is pretty darn good for what it offers. It has for the most part extensive histories of the artists it presents and -allthough not thorough-discographies that compliment these presentations. On that particular point comes the real miss, which is the behind the glamorous scenes look at things. The escapade element (and yes, im being ridiculously mild) is mostly absent, which is striking considering that the rock and pop world would not be what it was and is without it. Yes, there are mentions of the drug adventures as well as other \\"mishaps\\" but just mere mentions, in some cases these are omitted, and in any case less focus is given to issues as these than there should've been.  <br />   Granted, it would probably make the book double its size were it more detailed this way but then it would be more complete.  <br /> <br />   As a reference book though, or even as a starting point for those who are rediscovering or beginning to explore the 70s it's really, really good. It's perhaps too harsh to subtract a star on this review for what i mentioned above but then again i believe that a complete encyclopaedia is missing badly from the market. <br /> <br />   If you're looking to pick one out of the many 70s music books out there you wouldnt be off the mark by choosing this one.  <br />     <br /> <br />	2004-08-21

This is an amusing and ultimately very flawed book. At a time when the theory of the big-bang is heavily questioned and doubted, when gravity is now perceived as possibly being something other as what we've defined it by now, when Hawking is revising his up to now theories about black holes, when there's several -stil- missing links about human history which puzzle and throw into dissaray current anthropology (i could on and on for several pages),  when it's become a proven fact that the Sphinx has water erosion marks, and on top of that, when one knows the literally countless cases where scientific theories such as the ones M.Gardner collapsed comically under the influence of new and old evidence, books like this can only be viewed with extreme scepticism at best.<br /><br />  The fact that certain scientists view science as a new religion is disturbing enough. That the public does so burdened by the pressures of the scientific community who will allegorically burn anyone at the stake who dares disagree with their official dogma is even more worrying.<br /><br />  Gardner has put together a collection of essays which are supposedly \\"defending science\\" and are battling crank theories and pseudoscience. That sounds like a noble cause but the problem is that for the most part Gardner uses theories that could be as shaky as the ones he attacks. The examples are too many to list down here.<br /><br />  A very effective antidote to ultra-dogmatic books like this is Charles Fort's books. As well as any independent or open-minded investigator who knows that science is as fallible as anyone else.<br /><br />  I still recommend this book though as a reference point on how religious-like dogma can infiltrate the ranks of those who put themselves high up on a podium to be the new messiahs wearing white robes. On that it serves as a perfect example.	2004-08-20

Books about war can be so dramatically different even if they are essentially dealing with the same subject. It's less about \\"which war\\" and rather more about how one registers the whole experience on a psychological level. Also important is if and what kind of an agenda one carries with him. <br /> <br />   In \\"Colder than hell\\" we're offered an account from the eyes of a lieutenant who fought at the Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War. The main difference with other military history books is that the author, having been there, describes things through a spectre that i could best describe as \\"uninvolved\\". Books about the Vietnam war, for example, have that unmistakable political aspect to them which is obviously attributed to that very charged epoch they deal with, even if their authors were also direct war participants. <br /> <br />   In this one, what immediately struck me was that from the very first pages the author takes the possibility of being in a war not only almost naturally but seems to eagerly anticipate it. He doesnt ask any difficault questions, doesn't wonder why he's going to wind up some 1000s of miles away from home fighting people he hardly knows the culture of (and vice versa), but instead seems to consider this as a task that one approaches with questioning it at all. <br />Sign of times radically different than what followed the Korean War? More than certainly. That is perhaps an element that strikes as very intriguing in this book but it's left lingering somewhere in the beginning and the author doesn't touch it again. <br />   Still, it goes to show what dramatic changes took place after those years. <br /> <br />    Lieutenant Owen (the author) gives a morbid and incredibly vivid description on the events that happened in the Chosin Reservoir as the American Marines fought an almost face-to-face battle with their Chinese counterparts.  <br />    <br />    In a mountainous terrain and in bitter winter conditions with temperatures more than often below zero, sometimes under-equipped clotheswise, with very little time to rest or even be allowed to be under blankets and with frostbite claiming almost equally as many victims as the bullets and the mortars, Owen and his batallion fought (as any soldier ultimately does) their enemy, the elements, and themselves. Owen, keeps hitting the reader with honesty as he doesn't omit to mention his everpresent fear at the prospect of death looms nearer every day that goes by. <br /> <br />   He survived, but his accounts of those that fell next to him are given in a cold almost cynical manner, the way it actually happens when bullets are zipping over your head and you dont have time to ponder on the person dying next to you in agonising pain but only time to stay alive yourself. <br /> <br />   Most of the book is written in that manner, as if he's describing things live from the scene. Long emotional passages are not to be found here and this actually makes \\"Colder than hell\\" an ultra realistic description of the horrors it deals with. <br /> <br />   This will get more credit from you as you read it than i could possibly give here because it is, undoubtdely, a very gripping book. <br /> <br />    Heavily recommended for avid readers of military history. <br /> <br />    <br />	2004-08-18

When Dan Piraro hits the target the result is nothing short of great, but it would be a sacrilege to compare him with Larson because what he lacks is consistency. <br /> <br />   I came upon Piraro reading some very good reviews about him but after having read through \\"Bizarro Number 9\\" i wound up with mixed emotions. This by no means implies that i was dissapointed or that Piraro isnt a good humorist. He is. It's probably the Larson comparisons that threw my expectations way high, expectations that \\"Bizarro Number 9\\" didn't overall live up to. <br /> <br />    But comparisons aside, this is indeed a good read (some would associate a certain room of the house as appropriate for leafing through it..).  <br /> <br />     Cool for a gift as well, and cool for fans of this genre of comics, recommended for those who seek intelligent humor. <br /> <br />	2004-08-08

(Factoid Books)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Masterminds and simpletons of the underworld	In this new installment of the \\"Big Book of...\\" series the level of artistry and research stays high as it had in all other pieces so far. <br />   I own most of the installments that have hit the market over the past few years and simoultaneously I'm an avid comic-fan. That being as it is I can safely say that this happens to be one of the very best comics publications I've ever seen. <br /> <br />   Particularly to this book, it's a history of some of the most notorious underworld figures in the United States. Except for the masterheads of crime it also includes some characters which became famous rather for their lack of intelligence. In the 63 stories included are also figures which were well known in their time and faded into history afterwards but whose story is extremely interesting nevertheless. <br />  Impeccably researched (as usual) and with that subtle sarcasm or cynicism that this series is well known for, this is an absolutely must-have item. <br /> <br />    It's been often after I've read issues of the Big Book series that i went on to further reads because of what i discovered in these books. That i think, is a huge compliment in itself. If you're not acquainted with this series start over here with the \\"....Little Criminals\\" part. A pure gem. <br /> <br />	2004-08-08

Many of them, in one form or the other, still exist even if they are becoming rarer and rarer. <br />  <br /> It is obvious that we humans are capable of more societal flexibility than the slow-moving and often overpowering and overwhelming systems we live under today (emphasis on &quot;under&quot;). As other folk have demonstrated we could indeed live in societies based more on consensus rather than those where a filmsy &quot;majority&quot; rules ober the rest in heavily bureaucratic and (more importantly) constantly power-seeking democracies. <br />  <br /> While the book makes clear that societies such as the ones it lists ans studies did have a &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;leaders&quot; they were by no means unshakable in their positions nor did they possess enough power to abuse. Which, by the way, is the main point about the dangers of authority and the leading cause (pun intended) for people seeking alternatives to systems that are burdening human evolution as a whole. Not to mention human existence. <br />  <br /> Now, Barclay does a great job pointing out that the relatively headless societies he studies existed in particular historical frames and times but he does an even better job showing the capabilities of human societies. Sociological evolution as any evolution is a process that can go back and forth, adjusting itself until it can possibly find a format that serves the species' causes better. <br />  <br /> The author doesn't come with a saw to grind, he's very cautious to point out the &quot;mishaps&quot; of the peoples he studies, points out readily their misadvantages and carefully analyses their advantages, while, where appropriate, projects into the possibilities of such systems in the future. <br />  <br /> Immensely interesting even if it could have gone much deeper, this is a book that will intrigue those interested in the subject.	2004-08-03

Admittedly, this is the most important book for those interested not only in the Jungian approach in psychology, but also in the life itself of Carl Gustav Jung. Indeed, this is an autobiography, imbedded in which is most of Jung's theories and quite an adequate outline of his cosmotheory as well.<br />  Now, this being the book that &quot;allows&quot; us a glimpse into the soul of this psychologist, i was for one somewhat puzzled by the overall insight i got. While for the most part i appreciated Jung's bold approach in matters considered heavy taboos in his time (not to mention our time as well for certain particular issues), on the other side i found that Jung is self-contradicting at times, or murky, for lack of a more descriptive term.<br />  Jung dares to look on the &quot;other side&quot; and consider it openly an integral part of &quot;this&quot; side. What others deem as &quot;paranormal&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; is to Jung just the other side of the same coin. He discusses the reality under the accepted reality but he is not straightforward about it. If i wanted to take it far enough I'd even say he's not honest about it. He does mince hiw words much too often and stops short of telling you what he really thinks. But this hardly undermines his openmindedness. Same goes for his treatment of religion.<br />  In the beginning of the book he goes to great lengths in his denouncing of the western religion, and yet, all throughout the book he leaves countless hints that he's religious himself, without ever explaining in what sense. This was in my view perplexing.<br />  The part of the book where he details his views on psychotherapy and explains how he approached his patients is definately the highlight of this book, and it should be of paramount importance for those interested in that subject area.<br />  The last third of the book is mostly about Jung's travels. That part, might be disturbing for some, as one can sense that Jung felt some kind of well hidden superiority over the people he encountered. This superiority is often enough brought forward as his surprise over the insights these people offered him, but it still remains a mystery (at least to me) what he actually &quot;took&quot; from these people pertaining to their beliefs and approach in life. If anything, that is.<br />  All criticism aside, this is still essential reading. Jung was a person torn between the desire to explore the off-limits and his fear of being ostracised by the scientific community. In the gray area within that struggle is where one discovers Jung's most thought-provoking theories because that is where he presents himself bare.d of well hidden superiority over the people he encountered.

The least i could say about this wondrous book is that it's the closest you'll come to a mind-altering experience without chemical substances. From that on, this is a jaw-dropping read, and it's kinda difficult to summarise what it professes except if i put it on terms such as: &quot;it examines all those sides of 'reality' for which we have solid evidence of the existence thereof but because of a variety of reasons we refuse to acknowledge&quot;.<br />   Now, I know this sounds vague, but when you come across a book that deals with such a spectrum of topics such as alchemy, politics, the paranormal, history, secret societies, origins of certain philosophies, magic, the roots of nazism, UFOs, conspiracies,  etc, there is no simpler way to surmise it.<br />   This is easily one of those books that leave you a different person once you're done reading them, not in the way certain &quot;self-help&quot; books claim they do, but in the sense that it works like a massive curtain being pulled infront of you and a whole new picture being revealed behind it.<br />    There's no bibliography included at the end of it (allthough, through its pages, several books are mentioned as sources) but for those well-delved into the topics it discusses it's obvious that the scholarship involved here is impeccable.<br />   And apropos &quot;sources&quot;, this is exactly the biggest contribution of this book, the fact that it actually functions like a tremendous reference book, leading you eventually to other books of which you'd probably remain unaware had you not seen the sourcing here. It's more or less like a simply coded lexicon for those interested in diving well below the surface, for restless minds who suspect that &quot;this can't be all there is&quot;, a multi-key to unopened doors inside and outside ourminds.<br />    Being all that (and more), you'd expect a &quot;heavy read&quot;, a book written in wooden academic language, but this is far from being the case: &quot; The Morning of the Magicians&quot; is laid out in down-to-earth language and you won't be disturbed during your reading by trying to comprehend the sentences but instead you'll be left with the bare essence. You'll need only comprehend the concepts.<br />    Published originally in the 60s, and having accomplished a notorious reputation since then, it reads like what Charles Fort would sound as, if he were a scientist. And, even that description doesn't do it complete justice.<BR>     Absolutely essential for those who search...	2004-06-03
US	47065451	RIVQ8QFJ6KHCU	0714530387	477371485	The Room	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Dark, darker, Selby...	While this may not be -arguably- Selby's best book, one has to remember what his other books are mostly like: masterpieces. The &quot;Room&quot; only falls short because its &quot;trick&quot; might wear thin eventually, but this is by no means a certainty and it really depends on whether you allow it to wear thin.<br />   What the room is, is the mind of a very troubled and very concerned man. This man is concerned because he's confined in a cell with a possible heavy sentence awaiting (his trial pending). What we read throughout the whole book is only what goes on in this man's mind. There is no contact with anyone outside of this man, and all the dialogue to be found happens in his mind as well. <br />   We are treated to a barrage of fantacizing as he imagines the tremendous measures of revenge he will take on those who caused him to be incarcerated, but we are also given a rather incoherent flow of thoughts and fantasies, much like we'd get if we could glimpse into anyone's mind. The uniqueness of this person's mind is that basically anything that breeds in there has the signs of brutality written all over it. <br />    This is obviously not a book for the stomachically weak. Alone the fantasy with the dog training is one of the most brutal descriptions you'll come across in any book, and it spans across several pages. But this is by no means the only &quot;scene&quot; that will make for a gut-wrenching read. This guy has clearly got some issues, and as long as he remains locked up, the only he can work them out is in the confines of his own brain. <br />   Selby delivers the goods in top form, the language is (as usual in his books) very strong and merciless, and while on the surface it looks like one fantasy has no connection oncesoever with the next, the grotesque imagery, and the pattern that keeps (admittedly) slowly developing is akin to a perverse attraction. But, as some will know, perverse attractions have always been succesful.<br />   I don't know ofmany writers in Selby's league, and that in itself is an understatement actually. I also don't know many writers who'd be succesful even trying to copy him. His talent is multisided, but his strongest asset is how deep inside he gets in his characters, even when he's not speaking directly through their minds.<br />   However, if this would be your first Selby book, i'd advise you not to start from here: it's a rather &quot;difficult&quot; one to start from. Start instead from &quot;Last exit to Brooklyn&quot; or &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot;, both will &quot;ease&quot; you into the Selby-oid type of writting and the &quot;Room&quot; will become all the more accesible after that.<br />   A dark, very dark book, that clearly qualifies as one of the gems in the domains of ultragloomy literature.	2004-05-31

Treating someone of the caliber of Jung the way this book does is at best a very bad joke. Carl Jung was not a pop group, hence presenting his theories in a fragmented way by giving us a bit of this and a bit of that in a totally disconnected manner helps noone.<br />  It certainly doesn't do any justice to a mind like the one Jung possesed and it definately won't help any type of reader interested in Jung:<br />-for those already acquainted with the Jungian theories this book is going to be an utter waste of time. It doesn't help you go any deeper or progress in acquanting yourself with Jung's mindset and in no way does it work as a &quot;reference book&quot; which is what i imagine was the premise of the author who assembled this disastrously bad collection of Jungian essays together. In order for such an endeavour to have any hope for function ti would need to be at least 4 times the volume it has. Why do say that? Well, for starters, the essays presented in this book are so short, so much out of any coherence, and so taken out of context, that even Jung himself would've trouble detecting where they are taken from...<br />-for those NOT acquainted with Jungian thought, reading this book merely means that they will remain NOT acquanited with Jungian thought. I can't put it in a starker way than this and i feel no need to elaborate on this further. If you want to introduce yourself to the Jungian school of thought DO NOT under any circumstances begin with this book because you're running the risk of actually being turned off alltogether..<br />  Start instead with &quot;Memories, dreams and reflections&quot;. That is written by Jung himself, and while it's an excellent presentation to the way Jung approached psychology and psychotherapy, it's at the same time sort of an autobiography as well as a seriously insightful and as influential a book as they come...	2004-05-18

I read some of the negative reviews here at Amazon and they all struck me as inane drivel of the highest degree. If you're going to agree or disagree with any thesis you have to show why. If all you're going to come up with is name-calling and arguments about &quot;math in cereal&quot; (!!!, man, give us a break) or other , even worse, &quot;arguments&quot; like &quot;NASA says it aint no face and that's what i believe&quot; you're in my mind absolutely and positively hopeless. If, in the end, NASA and any institution of that order is for you a credible source, why bother thinking? Turn your brain OFFICIALLY off and let whomever, may that be NASA or anybody else, programm it for you. Why read what Hoagland or a number of other researchers out there profess? <br />   &quot;The Monuments Of Mars&quot; is a book for people who are keen of doing something rare: think for themselves. In order to do that, you need to entertain whatever available notion out there even if it totally comes in conflict with the definition of the world in your mind. Especially if such a notion is well argumentated and has been hardly refuted with adequacy.<br />   For those not familiar with what's presented in this book, here's a very ( and i mean, very) short summary: Hoagland along with a team of scientists ranging anywhere from geologists to physicists to computer programmers who resoluted photos, to historians and other specialties, analysed a vast series of photographs taken by NASA of the Cydonia region in Mars, photos in which the infamous &quot;Face&quot; appears, along with other clearly geometrical features such as pyramids or the clear designs of a former city. All these features, and their undisputed geometry, one would have to be either blind not to see, or terminally brainwashed. <br />   The only question which remained, was to first verify through statistical probability, what the odds were of these features having been made &quot;naturally&quot;. The odds are so staggeringlylow that it would be a travesty to dismiss these as natural creations. The next, and more important questions have to do with who made them and why. <br />    Why resort to odds when we could have more and clearer photographs of these features so the matter could be put to rest? Well, that's just it (especially for the naysayers), because Nasa refuses to rephotograph the region with a high resolution camera saying there's nothing there to be seen..And that despite all the &quot;noise&quot; about these features. Mysterious if not downright conspiratorial? Yes, obviously and undoudtedly so.<br />   I don't intend to go more into what Hoagland says. You can pretty much imagine in broad lines, and besides it's your decicion and your inclination whether you'll invest the effort in reading his book anyway. To me, if your inclination is beforehand negative, you would've easily fit in in a past world who thought the world is flat because the  church or &quot;scientists&quot; say so. And i could list a high number of such embarrasing examples, there's no shortage of them nor will there ever be.<br />   As to the book itself, it is one which is incredibly researched. The degree of scholarship in it is superb, and more importantly, it is not the work of ONE person. Hoagland did not sit down and think all this up as some would like the case to be. There's a vast array of people who worked with him from the scientific community and who agree with him. There's also a number of other resarchers who did NOT research this subject but yet came to the same conclusions with him. Sitchin would be one. Robert Temple would be another. And the list does go on you know, as any search on alternative archaelogy in Amazon or elsewhere would show you.<br />   The fact that we know only 5000-7000 years of human history when this planet numbers over a million years of existence means that we are actually in the dark about our origins. At least as far as &quot;mainstream science&quot; is concernedand this is a fact they accept themselves while offering us all kinds of comical explanations and tons of &quot;missing links&quot; in the process. The truth might be in fact very simple, that is, simple if you actually realise that the Universe is very probably bursting with intelligent life, not only now, but for millions of years in the past, and that the chance that we, are in very intriguing ways connected with the &quot;out there&quot; is also nothing shocking. It only is if you allow the world in your mind to be something painfully small.<br />   Only reading this book will more than likely not be enough to provide you with all the data supporting such theories. Yes i mean data, and not speculations. Raw data. You will need to pick up some Sitchin, some Temple, some Colin Wilson, or others. Only then will you able to form a more spherical and stronger opinion.<br />   But if you haven't done so up to now, Hoagland's book is a great place to start.<BR>   Absolutely essential material for people not content with the hilarious version of the truth spoon-fed to us on a daily basis.	2004-05-13

For what A.Beevor is interested in covering he's doing a great job. I start off with this remark because i think quite some unfair criticism had been directed at his book for a variety of reasons.<br />   I think that some of that criticism is to a degree justified. Beevor is an author who's more adept in the logistics at war and the descriptions he can put together from eyewitness accounts or other source books. He's much less adept on the &quot;whys&quot; and especially on the &quot;hows&quot;. His function is more like that of a reporter who was there and who relays what he saw. Often he fails on the &quot;bird's eyeview&quot; perspective or at going in more depth and he has trouble going into the collective psychologies of the sides involved. This is more apparent in other history books he's written like the &quot;Battle of Crete&quot; where he totally failed to capture the psychology of the Cretan who fought there and even that of the German which was more researchable (?) in comparison. I think he exhibits the some of same flaws in &quot;Stalingrad&quot;.<br />    But having said all that, for what this purports to be I'd have to repeat that it's one of the must-reads on the subject. It's an account that uncovers all the data you'd need to understand the enormity of what went on, and the truly horrifying scale of that incredibly significant battle. True, his penchant for detail might tire those readers not very much interested as to what brigade did what or what sector was covered by what army.<br />    Nevertheless, this is a definite cantputdowner of a book even if you'll have to resort to more books if your intent is to get a fuller understanding.<br />    However, if you read Beevor's book you'll already have a very vivid picture of what went on in Stalingrad, a picture very much upsetting in the atrocities and horrors it lays out for us.<br />    On another note, for some reviewers who think Beevor's account is &quot;too favorable&quot; for the Russians or &quot;pro-soviet&quot; i think this is a total exaggeration. Beevor lists in detail the atrocities of the soviet army towards its very own soldiers:<BR>-executions for deserters or for those &quot;not exhibiting adequate courage&quot;, or sending whole platoons to certain death with less than inadequate equipment (something the Germans commited too but for different reasons partially) or the total disinterest for civilian casualties while the city was under siege.<br />   Overall, a great primer on this tremendous historical event. Perhaps a more complete book on this event is yet to be written but there are several books on the market each covering this battle from different perspectives.	2004-04-07

As with any type of gymnastics, mental or physical, one finds that certain disciplines might not be of his liking. The same applies to this book, which is loosely divided into topics (Fables and Fancies, Philosophical paradoxes, Is Zen paradoxical etc. etc.).<br />    These topics are written in essay form, some essays being a mere small paragraph and others covering several pages. While the author isnt covering one specific subject but several, he does have a main albeit underlying theme, that of the paradox in general. He searches for paradoxes in many areas and pinpoints not only the intellectual value in them but also the entertainment value as well. <br />    Still, i wound up having mixed feelings as many of his essays struck me more as sophisms (for sophisty's sake alone) with little to offer while others came across as profoundly deep and effective. This imbalance is prevailent throughout this book and is sort of offsetting occasionally. When the author hits his target the result is excellent such as in the chapter entitled &quot;Is Zen paradoxical&quot; or in specific forays within other chapters.<br />    I've discovered that he's written a book called &quot;Is the Tao silent&quot;, and seeing that his essays on the Zen were dead-on, I'm thinking that trying it out might be a very good idea.<br />    Still, the overwhelming feeling that stayed with me after reading this particular book was like having listened to a musician who's a virtuoso with his instrument but who often lacked in substance. <br />    Nevertheless, from a purely philosophical point of view it had more than its share of good moments and it would be unfair not to mention that Smullyan does have the charisma of stimulating minds even through mere sophisms. Possibly an author that will intrigue you to explore more of his works...	2004-03-26
US	47065451	R2HBJZ2CDKYODY	1571741119	5629120	The Books in My Life	Books	3	18	21	N	N	Bizzarely incomplete...	Since this is a book obviously aimed at Colin Wilson fans I'll get straight to the chase:<BR>In a work such as this one would expect several things. First and foremost, that it would be a seriously bulky book. Afterall, this is C.Wilson we're dealing with here, a man with a 20.000 book library in his house and one of the most prolific modern writers. In a book where he's discussing the most influential books in his life, you'd expect something like a 700-1000 page mammoth, ranging from his teenagehood up until now. Instead, we get a rather &quot;lazy&quot; 300 page offer where mostly literature is presented and to a lesser extend some philosophy.<br />    That's strange considering that for the better part of the last decade C.Wilson has been investigating such intriguing areas as the paranormal, the occult and the possibility of alien existence or activity. In these topics Wilson has done some of his very best work, and I'm sure i don't stand alone with this opinion. Yet, there's nothing to be seen in &quot;The Books in My Life&quot; about all that. I, for one, was expecting a big part of the book dedicated to these areas with an appropriate bibliography accompanying it. I was dissapointed that all this was ommited, but it's also obvious that this was a choice C.Wilson made, allthough I'm not at all convinced about the logic behind it. Unless of course there is a &quot;part 2&quot; of this book to follow, focusing only on the latter stage of his research and works. I'm very curious about it all.<br />    Strictly speaking about this book, I wasn't exactly thrilled even though C.Wilson is my favorite author and researcher. First of all he mentions several authors who -he himself admits- play no role anymore in his life and haven't done so in many years. I fail to see the point in mentioning them then especially when he does so at length. I would understand it had he devoted references to them, but whole chapters just to dismiss them?<br />    Then again, and this ifound even more odd, the type of literature that he discusses struck me as shallow. I had the belief (or call it illusion if you like) that in C.Wilson's influences I'd discover some majorly iconoclastic literature. To be fair, i did discover some but in painfully small dosages. The rest came across to me as books I wouldn't be interested in, as they seem to be works that deal with things most people are concerned with in their teenage years. And not very good books at that either as Wilson himself says too. <br />    I remained with the feeling that Wilson used the theme of &quot;the books I've read&quot; only to bring forward (not for the first time) his agenda of steering our conciousness or moods. Now, that is a damn interesting agenda and certainly one worth devoting many years into perfecting as an &quot;inner skill&quot;. Speaking of that, i think that some reviewers may (I'm not 100% sure myself) have misunderstood Wilson as a professional optimist exactly because of this agenda of his, which can be easy to miscomprehend.<br />    Wilson doesn't see the world as a very rosy one and this is very apparent for anyone that has read his previous books. What he suggests is that by achieving a large degree of control over our consciousness we thereby affect our outlook on the world especially when one keeps in mind that reality is subjective. Surely, and one reviewer who tackles this is certainly right, Wilson doesn't seem to take into consideration all the &quot;outside&quot; factors such as politics and economics that deeply affect our lives. I tend to think that Wilson doesn't have complete answers so he decides to go for what he's sure about, leaving out those areas that would complicate the question. That, and I'd readily agree with other reviewers here, makes his overall arguments weak or ambiguous.  The main body of his agenda though (consciousness steering) still maintains its intrigue. It has to be processed in a more detailed analysis though, and it needsto incorporate more factors that are definitely important before it can shape up into something more accurate and &quot;realistic&quot;.<br />     Generally speaking, simply because i enjoy reading C.Wilson i found the book pretty good at parts but mostly because of positive bias on my part. Other parts were (shockingly) boring and others had me searching for the significance. <BR>     As i said in the beginning: he &quot;needs&quot; to offer us a part II, where he talks about books that have driven him to the research he's undertook the last 10 years. Now, that would be way more interesting. With an agenda (which we all anyway have) or without it...	2004-03-25
US	47065451	R1YY5BUXL6VJGZ	0140138773	79050350	Other Worlds: Space, Superspace, and the Quantum Universe (Penguin science)	Books	2	4	13	N	N	It reads like your video manual...	The first thing that needs to be examined about a book such as this is to whom is it addressed to. If it's aimed towards people with a very basic knowledge in physics and it attempts to explain the quantum world to them, it has more than probably failed. A target group other than that would be a moot target assuming they'd already have a fundamental knowledge of quantum physics.<br />   This book reads like your proverbial video manual. You suspect that its author might (and that's a major &quot;might&quot;) know what he's talking about but you certainly won't. In the end your video recorder won't work and you'll be bored breathless.<br />   Even though Paul Davies wants to delve into (and explain) such exciting matters such as the possibility of parallel universes and other dimensions a great many things go wrong in the process:<br />-first of all he's totally unreadable, unleashing pages upon pages of dull writting at you. Where illustrations, graphs and diagrams should be present to help the reader understand what it is he's saying, they are no where to be seen.<br />-secondly, his whole thesis is flawed because it's riddled with dogma scattered all over the book. Things become even worse because many times the scientific dogma thrown at us contradicts the author himself. Other times it seems apparent that the author is spectacularly unaware of certain facts that would make some of the theories he presents weak. Example: on pages 142-145, Davies argues that the conditions on earth are amazingly ideal for life to flourish. Earlier by the way, he's argued that life is rare in the universe exactly because you need ideal conditions. Anyhow, he goes on explaining that we live on a &quot;relatively quiet place in the universe&quot; without cataclysms or massive upheavals that would threaten life on earth. Sadly though, it's well known that there must have been at least 4 such massive upheavals in the earth's history which came very near to destroying all life and the conditions for it necessary (due to comet or asteroid impacts or other reasons we haven't figured out yet) and yet life survived. This actually shows that life is way more durable than the author assumes. Then anybody who's read a only little bit about asteroids and comets knows that it's only a myth that we live in a quiet corner and that we might be subject to surreal destruction any given minute. Then he goes on claiming that life cannot exist beyond temperatures of boiling water. Maybe someone should've pointed out to the author that bacteria have been found to happily live in the earth's lava of all places!!!!!<br />    Such comical passages are not isolated in the book. In fact, most of the &quot;Other worlds&quot; is jam-packed with dogmatic assumptions like that. I could list several examples such as the above but then i'd need to write a small book myself.<br />   What i found even more annoying in this book, is that while the author actually wants to present us with an unconventional view of the world and reality as we should perceive it, what he manages instead is to provide yet another bible for the clueless.<br />   If you're going to entertain notions such as parallel universes, or if you're going to actually admit that on the subatomic level things do not make sense the way physics has been (???) making sense of our world so far, then you have to, no, no you are absolutely obliged to, leave any possibility open. In a parallel universe there's no guarantee that anything &quot;works&quot; the way it does here. I'm going too far, because in fact even in in THIS universe there's no guarantee that everywhere things work as they do here. But, when you reach passages where the author talks about calculating the total mass of black holes in the universe you lose all hope of unconventionality and you'reassured you're in the realm of a new religion dawning. We already have more than enough religions though, and certainly more dogmas than we can handle.<br />   The quest for a book that deals with quantum physics in a comprehensive, and more importantly, undogmatic way, unfortunately continues...	2004-03-16

At one point in this book, the main character has started a reading mission by going to the library, picking out books (mainly the \\"classics\\") and reading them frantically. Later on he comments on these \\"classics\\": \\".....they are all a massive pretentious pomp about not much\\". Now, that is a heavy, ultraheavy statement to make when it comes to \\"classics\\". While i have the same opinion i also think that if you're going to deliver a hardcore critique like that you better be able to back it up. Bukowski does so in an overwhleming way not only in this (autobiographical) novel but basically in all his books.<br />     The thing about Bukowski is that his writting is so direct, so mercilessly direct in fact, that you feel more like watching a film rather than reading a book.<br />      Take the story in \\"Ham on rye\\" for example: this story for all intends and purposes is not an extraordinary story. By no means. Stories about poverty or growing up in financially dire times (like the 30s in America) can be found aplenty. Stories about abusive or clueless parents (or both) also abound in literature. Stories about discovering sexuality during teenagehood just as well. But in the end, no matter what the story, extraordinary or not, what matters is who tells it and how.<br />    Someone can start telling you the most incredible story and still fail to grab you with it. Bukowski could be talking for 4 pages about some \\"chick\\" he saw working as a clerk somewhere and the fantasies he has about her and you'll be totally engulfed in reading it. Or, he could be describing something as mundane as a football game and the bravado involvd in it and you'll feel like being right there standing next to a linebacker and due in for a hard hit.<br />    All this is intimidating and charismatic enough but when Bukowski spices it all up with his cynical and ruthless humour the sum is almost always a masterpiece.<br />   I've read quite some of his novels and regardless of the theme what always gets me is the power of his narrative. This guy can be compared to an elite few in that sector and those few would have very little to do with \\"classics\\" but more with writers who came straight from the underground of their time and who have the gift of being able to take in every important detail of what they are observing.<br />    \\"Ham on rye\\" is basically Bukowski growing up in the 30s while a crisis is at its peak, with a father who has made it a mission to beat him up systematically so he can become \\"worthy\\", a mother who's as clueless as your nearest wall, and a case of horrible acne (the \\"worst on the planet\\" he says) which condemns him to outsiderdom . But acne or no acne, Bukowski was an outsider anyway. He never \\"fit-in\\" exactly because he was beyond most of the people around him. He saw things they never saw and grasped things they never even suspected they were there for the grasping.<br />   It's also about a young Bukoswki discovering the opposite sex, and the drive that basically makes this planet go round, and it's simoultaneously a young Bukoski forming his first sociological conclusions which -predictably- are quite detached from the mainstream.<br />    If you've never read this author start here. It might be widely under discussion what his best novel is, but thsi one is one that easily combines all his talents in a hilarious, often explosive and then again bitter package. Those who claim that once you read \\"Ham on Rye\\" you'll want to read all his novels are absolutely dead on.	2004-03-09

What you should be expecting are pages upon pages with platitudes, flashbacks in history with blitz biographies about people who introduced scientific counting, more platitudes, a dry style of writting, but worst of all (and i'd be willing to swallow the rest if it wasn't for that) no solution offered.<br />     David Boyle does make clear, albeit tiresomely, that numbers and counting have only contributed to making us further unhappy and are simply adding to more confusion, added manipulation from politicians  and corporations and the lengthening of our illusions as we try to solve problems by measuring and countermeasuring them. He does show that actually a lot of the things we measure are indeed not measurable and he does add that other things that should be -maybe- measured are not.<BR>    <BR>    But that's where the contradiction begins to unravel and there's no saving the ship afterwards. If the solution is measuring &quot;other&quot; things then we'd have some sort of schizzophrenia where we try to solve one problem by replacing it with another of actually similar nature. That doesn't really sound too convincing or promising.<br />     There's several bits of data and trivia includedin this book which at points make it worthwhile but in the end most of it is lost amid the pointlessness of the rest. <br />    Ultimately, what you have when you're done is more food for thought which is not actually inspired directly by the book itself but rather indirectly. There's an issue in there somewhere (about this you'll feel certain) but the irony is that &quot;Tyranny in numbers&quot; almost challenges you to write another book yourself and actually propose something. That can't be a good sign, now can it?	2004-03-08

It's more Dilbertine for the addicted like myself and allthough there are a couple of minuses to mention the level of hilarity stays high as always. And how could it not? The inspiration from the corporate world keeps coming through in tsunami waves.<br />      While one of the most cult characters in the Dilbert series (Wally) gains even more of the spotlight other equally legendary characters like Ratbert but above all Dogbert himself keep getting lesser and lesser appearances. That's a pity actually as especially these two have offered unforgettable moments in the past. Another thing connected with these two fading somewhat is that we get fewer moments of Dilbert at home and more in the office. Tha creates somewhat of an imbalance which was not present in the initial installments of the series.<br />    All in all though, this gets adequately compensated by Adam's invincible humor and the introduction of new characters who might have less of a lifespan in comparison to Ratbert and Dogbert but who provide for some freshness nevertheless.<br />    Other than that it's Wally galore to the max. Wally has been the secret ace of this comic all along. This is cynicism at its very best and its most hardcore. The lines coming out of Wally's mouth are surreal.<BR>     The Dilbert series continues to be a classic.	2004-03-05

They also dont believe in the separation of things allthough that would need be further explained and that's not my intent here.<BR>   The Kyballion is basically an introduction to the 7 basic hermetic principles (they are subdivided in many other levels) and a rather brief explanation for each of those seven.<br />   It doesn't matter whether you ultimately embrace this philosophy or not. Unless for some bizzare reason you happen to be negatively biased, you'll find that hermetics apply (or will apply) to your understanding regradless of which philosophy seems to have made sense to you up until this point. <BR>   Hermetic philosophy has this aura about it where things seem to be making automatic sense within you, as if these are truths or part of a larger truth that you innerly possess anyway but which need to be &quot;ignited&quot; sort of speak.<br />    You'll find that the 7 principles explained and analysed in it can be applied in mostly everything and whether your reading up to now has been of depth in science or the (so-called) &quot;paranormal&quot; certain aspects will begin to take a clearer form.<br />    What's also quite certain is that you'll feel intrigued to go deeper after reading this book. <BR>    Another thing that's striking about the Kyballion is that very often the reader feels he's reading a &quot;scientific&quot; book than rather a philosophical one. Hermetists did not look at their philosophy in the sense of simply trying to analyse human nature at its core and only slightly bothering with the surroundings but instead looked at the biggerscheme of things realising that this is the only sound way to attempt to define anything.<BR>   <BR>   At the very worst the Kyballion will prove to be precious mental gymnastics for your mind. At best, it will be the key to several doors you never thought existed.	2004-03-05

Ant that's just a small part of the cliches that will bombard you.<br />   But it's a horror novel you say and such words are inevitably unavoidable? Well that should be the case to a degree, to a control degree to be precise. But an author who takes a &quot;best of&quot; from all the horror novels he's ever read and throws it together in a massively uninspired assembly isn't going to be rising in the ranks of his contemporaries too soon.<br />    This novel is utterly unscary and spectacularly predictable. There's no twists you cant predict, hell, most of the lines coming out of the mouths of the thin characters are so predictable you feel like you've (sadly) read this before.<br />    On a more positive note, if you're a beginner with horror novels this might do for you.

To begin with, if you tend on the masochistic side this book will definately serve ya well. No, not because of the subject matter, absolutely not. The fact that the probabilities we're heading into extinction are increasing daily is undeniable unless you've turned your brain off and that I'd be willing to believe after having lived 37 years and watched my fellow humans go on about their affairs they way they do.<br />    No, that would not be why this book is actually a torture. After you're done with the first half of the book you might feel a little tired if not somewhat numb. You'll just be done with going over various disasters that are threatening us, most of which are self-caused: comets about to blast us to kingdome-come, nuclear wars intending to fry us ruthlessly into oblivion, diseases which either &quot;jumped&quot; out of labs or out of nature's arsenal, overpopulation and pollution and the combination of thse two, shortage of food, nanotechnology and the machines taking over (where's Arnie when ya need him) and so on and on.<br />    Now this is all a reality most of us are too irresponsible to face up to, indeed, as a species we are what i call &quot;perversely intelligent&quot;, that is, we have intellectual horsepower which is incredibly difficult to groom in a a truly meaningful way and we are thus subjects to dangers caused by that very intelligence.<br />   Writting a book about this, should be, again perversely, highly entertaining. It would by default be humorous because how can you actually discuss so much shortshightedness, idiocy, and the impending doom as the direct product without seeing the humour in it? The author of this book can. He takes us through these fist chapters with a language so dry and lifeless you'd think the end is already behind us and books are now written by left-over survivor computers which were not programmed for humour.<BR>   Ah, but wait. You thought this is heavy, and if you havent quit by then (being possibly not the lion-hearted type) you're in for a major treatment that will suck out all your life force and leave you connected to another machine checking for a pulse:<br />the latter part of the book (its second half practically) is basically a ridiculous attempt to tie all this together with philosophy. Now philosophy, for the uninitiated, isnt supposed to be a life-threatening experience. Not really. Professor Leslie though, puts in a courageous effort to convince us of the opposite, and I'd be lying if i said he doesnt coming damn close. <br />    Taking up highly insignificant theories few ever heard of, and elevating them to the holy grail of philosophy, the author transforms his book to a readscape as fertile as the Sahara. Hundreds of pages of pretentious pomp about not much really isnt what i associate with philosophy. Especially when it's coupled with aggresive arrogance : not too few times, the author basically praises himself after he argues on his own with his imaginary opponents in the philosophy field, beats them and then triumphantly announces his victory. That's downright pathetic and even if the philosophical quest in this book was enjoyable (far, very far from) this would still spoil it beyond recovery.<br />     Look elsewhere. You dont need the suffering really. The author does convince us that the end is near (which isnt hard actually) but then, since it is, why make it all the more agonisingly painful by going through unbearable books such as this? Save the precious little time you have left.	2004-02-28

Richard Laymon uses shock, gore and oceans of blood to make his novel work but even all that intimidation fails in the end to make one cohesive and intriguing story.<br />    It need not have been that way though. As the story begins a family is invaded in their house by a gang of sadistic murderers who have formed a secret killing cult and who take pleasure in torturing and eventually killing their victims. As the family members are one-by-one taken out in horrifying ways, a visiting girl and one other child survive and are hunted down in the middle of the night as they are now witnesses and pose a great threat to the cult should they stay alive.<br />   This part of the book, which by the way kicks off by 200/h (hardly any sugarcoated intro involved) is by far the most interesting. The chase is gripping and intriguing and goes on for considerable length. As the two kids eventually escape, the novel shifts into the efforts of the gang to find them again and &quot;silence&quot; them. The girl's father who's a cop (alert: cliche in progress) is now along with the other child under police protection and this poses serious problems for the gang.<br />     What happens next is for the most part predictable to..death(pun intended) and reminds not a few of b-movies with such themes: the killer who seems to be dead but isnt and reappears to &quot;take care of business&quot;, the half-spooky sequences etc etc..<br />    The author uses an interesting technique to keep the interest high, namely, the one member of the gang who's been assigned to get the kids keeps dictating in tapes his actions as he goes along. This is to &quot;help&quot; us see into his mind. That works for the most part but what definately doesnt work are the dialogues between the &quot;good guys&quot; in the book, the girl her father, the other kid and others that briefly appear. These parts and the dialogues involved are unmercifully boring and if you skip them you wont miss a single thing of even minorimportance.<br />    Worst of all, the poor parts of the novel occupy a bulky part of it, too bulky to let the rest of the story succeed.<br />    Laymon tried to put together a gory story which when it comes to gore and shock wants to resemble the levels in the Hannibal trilogy, but he fails ingloriously.<br />    Might intimidate a teenager (at best) but any further ambition for this book is rather far-fetched.	2004-02-17

The only way i could see someone not being thoroughly engulfed in this marvelous work of a book is if he's either brainwashed beyond repair and refuses to hear anything entertaining notions that go against the &quot;programm&quot; in his mind, or, worse still, if someone is basically cerebrally pulseless.<br />  Hancock spreads out a super convincing, mm, not so much theory, but argument. At no point in his book, again to his credit, does he dogmatically claim &quot;look, there WAS intelligent life on Mars at some point&quot; but he does claim that the evidence is overwhelming towards such a direction and that the rather bizzare attitude of Nasa about this might be actually confirming this or at the very least fuels suspicion to the max.<br />  The premise here is the stunning &quot;monuments&quot; in the area of Cydonia and the implications arising from this. It's not only the well known (???) face on Mars but also the hexagonal eerily symmetrical pyramids and other such phenomena that have tell-tale signs of artificiality about them.<br />  Even though i've read quite some, especially on the net, about the &quot;Face&quot; i found that there was actually an ocean of data i was totally unaware of. Hancock goes on a lenghty but very pleasant to read diatribe about those constructions but where it gets immensely interesting is when he tackles the more-than-strange behavior of Nasa about the whole issue. NASA to put it in a nutshell has been basically fronting the theory that not only the winds are particularly talented out on Mars but that they are also selectively talented as they seem to be creating things in Cydonia and only.<br />  That might be laughable enough one would think, but their overall attitude to public demand for further and detailed investigation on these anomalies so the matter could (?) be put to rest has been borderline conspiratorial. The world has either had to deal with outright refusals  or with grainy photos that Nasa releases in an apparent effort to conceal what really? Questiosn that scream for immediate answers. NASA general politics are also discussed in the process and, well, they dont seem exactly &quot;crystal-clean&quot; stuff to put it extremely mildly.<br />  But by then you'd only be half way through the book: the latter half is the one that -incredibly-manages to capture the imagination even more albeit in a macabre and cosmically scary way.<br />  If the death of Mars as all evidence overwhelmingly suggests came from a cosmic bombardment of comets or fragments thereof what are the implications to us here? Especially since the spectacular &quot;atatck&quot; of comet Levy-Shoemaker on Jupiter there has been more discussion about such a danger even if the budget we actually have on comet-orbit watching is downright ridiculous.<br />  Hancock reveals to the uninitiated, like myself, that comets are not a distant low-probability threat but an ever-present and increasingly threatening reality. Alone in our solar system there are 100s of 1000s of them flying about in anarchic orbits and in mindbending speeds (most between 45.000-60.000klm/hour). Many are so called &quot;earth-crossers&quot; as they regularly (in universal terms) cross our orbit.<br />  When one thinks that our current theory holds that the dinos became history indeed because of a comet or that there have been not just that one but several seriously damaging impacts in Earth's past, but also, that contrary to mainstream belief a comet does not have to be &quot;giant size&quot; (i.e planet-size) but amere few kilometers in diameter to make the &quot;blue planet&quot; another cosmic corpse with a past. But with no present.<br /><br />  Hancock does also question the possible connection between a past civilisation on Mars and ourselves and again, the evidence more than confirms his notion that such a connection is not some far-out sci-fi type thought but it is actually supported by our ancient heritage. What i like a lot about Hancock compared to other researchers of the genre is that he's actual very casual and undogmatic even when he suggests (but never insists) such dazzling theories.<br />  An absolutely tremendous book on all levels. If you do have a &quot;sucpicion department&quot; in your brain the &quot;Mars Mystery&quot; will confirm your worst fears. All this has nothing to do with &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; by the way. As a journalist once said at the beginning of the 20th century:<br />&quot;...it's not the conspiracy theories that interest me, it's the theories about conspiracies.&quot;size) but a mere few kilometers in diameter to make the &quot;blue planet&quot; another cosmic corpse with a past. But with no present.<BR>   <br />    Hancock does also question the possible connection between a past civilisation on Mars and ourselves and again, the evidence more than confirms his notion that such a connection is not some far-out sci-fi type thought but it is actually supported by our ancient heritage.

Any quick search either here at Amazon or in google about books dealing with Atlantis will show that there's a vast number of them out there. The reason i picked this one was that I'd previously read another book by this author (Synchronicity and you) which I found mindblowing.<br />I was rewarded beyond my expectations. &quot;The Destruction of Atlantis&quot; is nothing short of absolutely fascinating.<br />    Frank Joseph takes all the latest research results available to us, especially those that have been aided by modern technology and combines them masterfully with geological data and -of course- mythology accounts to provide overwhelming evidence not only of the existence of Atlantis but of thorough details of its civilisation and the characteristics of its inhabitants.<br />    But more impressively, the account on how Atlantis was destroyed is hair-raising. These days it's not more a scientific crime to utter the dreaded A-word. Well, not for the most openminded scientists out there. Atlantis is being again revisited and re-researched with a vengeance by a new generation of historians, geologists and astronomers, especially those that understand the concept of looking at mythology as a definitive account of history and not a collection of allegories.<br />    The theory presented here in entirely convincing manner is that Atlantis was located where today's present day Canary Islands are and that it was devastated by the cataclysmic force of a cosmic storm. That included the raindown of asteroids very probably originating from the Taurides. An asteroid of massive size that fell in the Atlantic was responsible for global catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Tsunamis that rose to 300-500 meters and oblitarated not only that island but most of the coastal civilisations of Greece and Egypt coupled with powerful chain-earthquakes and intense volcanic activity resulting in millions of dead and the freezing of those civilisations. This would then account for the up-to-now puzzling gaps we have about the Bronze age era.<br />    Atlantis itself sank really in one day and night -as Plato had described in &quot;Kriteas&quot;- taking down with it one of the most compelling civilisations of those times.<br />    Reading about such an event is at the very least humbling. Inevitably it makes you think about our current arrogance as a species and the parallels with the arrogance that the Atlanteans themselves had displayed are chilling. <br />     Frank Joseph happens to be incredibly charismatic not only as a researcher but as an author as well. Normally, books dealing with such issues are not always easy to read. Many are riddled with heavy erudite overscholarly styles and dry language, but Joseph's language and descriptive style is a sheer treat.<br />    He provides his own account of that macabrely monumental day when Atlantis went down already in the opening of the book complete with his version of the Atlanteans trying to flee only to be engulfed by behemoth walls of water or to boil alive from the volcanoes on the island spilling surreal amounts of lava into the sea.<br />    He then goes on to detail about the latest data we have concerning the theory he puts forward. His inevitable listing of global myths commemorating a world-deluge is absolutely necessary as it concretely shows that the &quot;allegory approach&quot; of such accounts is naive. The first parts of this book are already capturing but even as you reach the middle and the end of it it only gets better and more intimidating.<br />   The idea of a cosmic disaster of such a magnitude was, is and will remain one of the biggest threats humanity has to face. Recent evidence from the crashing of comet Levy-shoemaker have emphatically demonstrated the type of danger we are dealing with and how powerless we might be against it ultimately. <br />   But coming back to Atlantis, this issue remains one of tremendous importance as it is eventually bound to change the dogmas about ancient history in a rather uncomfortable way for those who approach history in the dry monodimensional way it has been dealt with up to now. The legacy of that civilisation is seemingly haunting in a very interesting way. It dissapeared but never really died. Its implications remain as significant as hey could ever be.<br />    A chilling, intimidating wonderfully researched and presented book and a must for anybody with interest in &quot;alternative archaelogy&quot; even if that term is beginning to lose the quotation marks by now. There's nothing &quot;alternative&quot; about the existence of Atlantis. Nor with other even more intimidating matters. Reality was never &quot;alternative&quot; but it's everfascinating...	2004-01-16

This book comes close to literary schizzophrenia if i ever encountered it in written form.<br />    Keeping in mind that the author aspires to explain &quot;complicated&quot; issues like voids, vacuums and the general concept of nothingness, this book could indeed have been another horror to read through like many such books are for those of us who dont spend our lives in labs.<BR>     I was more than surprised then when i discovered that for 200 odd pages (2/3 of the effort) D.Barrow does an incredible job explaining his subject in brilliant manner.<BR>   <BR>     Beginning by backtracking in history, to exhibit how the ancients dealt with the concept of nothing and therefore needing to introduce the conception and the introduction (or non-introduction) of the number zero Barrow kept me heavily intrigued and increasingly stimulated. I was in fact in pure awe for a while, especially as the book progressed to the origins of the universe, early experiments about the vacuum and the startling things we've discovered about it, and then on to the ever-fascinating subject of the expansion of the universe (or agin, the non-expansion thereof). That part of the book is very enriched with philosophy which makes it all the more captivating. Philosophy, it may be unknown to some, has played a pivotal part in the development of physics. Before you can ever begin experimenting with anything you first need to grasp it even as an abstract concept in your mind. <br />    That far, this was easily the first book that could explain in a very comprehensive manner why the universe might be expanding and what the causes of such an effect might be, as well as, the effect of vacuums in this process. The joy didnt stop there, at least not for a while yet. Introducing theinevitable Einstein theorisations the author kept using down-to-earth language and very effective examples to build his case.<br />    But then for reasons i believe to be obvious the whole things falls apart. As if another author takes over 2/3 of the way in, the &quot;Book of nothing&quot; becomes almost a list-down of mathematical types, and descriptions of ultra-complicated experiments and even more convoluted theories. Worse yet, the language becomes wooden and tiresome, the examples fade off to ambiguity and the reading becomes a very, very difficult task. <BR>   An incredible effect to watch unfolding before my very eyes. I couldn't believe how much i'd actually grasped through the early stages of this book and how &quot;nothing&quot; (there is my pun) i grasped later on. And saying i grasped nothing later on is meant literally. I found myself reading the last 150 pages of the &quot;Book of Nothing&quot; as if it were hieroglyphics and were it not for the brilliance of this book initially i would've given it up all together.<br />    What happened then. Well, in my opinion, what happened was one of the following or some combination of them:<BR>-Barrow might actually be a better philosopher than he's a physicist, hence he might be practicing the wrong profession.<BR>-as is the case with other scientists who've written such ambitious books, the suspicion lingers threatfully on that they themselves might not understand what they're talking about. Indeed, a major principle of communication states that if your message is not understood then it is 100% your fault. But even more importantly, if your message isnt understood then your message might not be...right.<br />Whichever the case, this is not the important thing. What is important is how this book is divided in half. Half of it absolutely incredible, fun to read, ultra-stimulating and then the other half a pure torture of a read with no reward in sight.<br />    For the part that does reward though i couldn't possibly over-reccommend this book. It's a must read especially if you feel there are concepts you dont seem to understand about the latest theories concerning the universe, its origins or its future, the vacuums and voids and other elements connected to this big (second pun, unintended this time) picture.<br />    If you find yourself giving up on the &quot;Book of nothing&quot; as you approach its conclusion, dont worry. Your overall effort wont be in nought.	2003-12-30

Comic art of the finest order and incredible historical value.    <BR>   In this case, it's hoaxes or seeing it another way the ability of humans to be fooled in the most unlikely and bizzare ways, a process that more than often has led in a dramatic change in the course of history.<br />    For those that are familiar with the \\"Big book..\\" series the comics offered here are nothing less than gems as some of the greatest comic makers colloborate to put this together. <BR>   But if you use these books as reference points (their bibliographies are treasures for such a use) you're bound to wind up with a very in-depth knowledge of history, one that's far-distanced from the mainstream-polished version you've been served up to now.<BR>   Some of the stories on display on this book might be somewhat known, most are not, but what's even more impressive is that some seem too outrageous to even be close to the truth. Sadly, for the record of human history all of them are 100% real.<BR>   <BR>   Highlights include:<BR>-the story of F.Kreisler who duper critics into thinking he was playing pieces of great composers but had instead composed them on his own. And this for decades! One of the great embarrasments for the world of critics and a lesson to be discovered.<BR>-the infamous Hitler diaries, a definitive case showing that money and greed dictates the \\"news\\".<BR>-The BBC riot panic and the very similar but far more sophisticated \\"War of the worlds\\" by O.Welles<BR>-The Boxer rebellion in China, instigated by 4 journalists and a fake story they put up in Denver!<BR>-Sawing Manhattan in half (!!!!)and how 1000s of workers were actually convinced that this \\"project\\" was to take place, showed up on the day it was supposed to start only to find none of the \\"organisers\\" there...<BR>-Brian Hughes the king of pranksters as well as another prankster who actually managed to sell New York..<BR>-the much unknown to many tuliphysteria in Holland.<br />These are of course just a few of the tens of stories included in this truly great book.

US	47065451	R2GH43YAED7SE8	158827571X	298909988	Anarchism and Other Essays	Books	5	71	73	N	N	Emma Goldman's essays collected	I've heard from many people who are interested in reading books about anarchism (allthough i think the term \\"anarchism\\" is incorrect) that most books about anarchy are \\"heavy\\" and difficult to get through much less understand because they aim their content to readers that have a good backround of political understanding (its terminologies, its \\"schools\\" of thought, its currents and so forth..).<br />If this happens to be your problem then this book will be ideal if you want to discover what this political philosophy stands for and what its issues are and, indeed, have been for a long time.<br />Emma Goldman, a woman with as fiery a personality as they come, has put together here a number of essays about anarchy that are easy to comprehend and definately thought inspiring.<BR>   Despite this book having been first published in 1917 it loses nothing of its importance in the current state affairs as all of the issues Goldman deals with not only remain unsolved but they have -in the meantime- become a social burden or a social disaster much worse than back in her time. Oh, and back in her time things already looked bad enough.<br />What you get here is, summarily, the following:<BR>-anarchy, what is it and what does it stand for? Beyond the mainstream media cliches anarchy stands for personal and societal freedom of the highest conceivable order. A freedom, anarchists insist, that is not a utopia. It's basically a hard lesson in crushing your illusions and opening unthought of doors of perception of what freedom really means. That would be then something other than being in a cage and having food thrown in. Even if the cage is invisible..<br />-Hard punching essays about the prison system and the everself-destructing notion of patriotism.. Funny how every line one reads in there could've been written yesterday. Not much has changed. After decades and decades of the imprisonment system has society become more law-abiding? That would be a thundering no. Why is that? As for patriotism, the incredible notion of dying for your country the same one that might be killing you slowly while draining you of all your resources and enslaving you in a wage system and a daily mindless-toil called \\"work\\" . here, Emma has to say a lot. There's always a reason to die if someone is going to make money out of it (that would be NOT you) and dress the whole \\"cause\\" up as patriotic..<br />-The hypocrisy of puritanism as well as the seemingly eternal joke of marriage and \\"love\\" are also given the treatment they deserve. In a society based on hypocrisy alltogether, you have to start on a personal level. You have to lose your personal chains before you attempt to free others. Your personal chains begin with the things you've been taught to hold most sacred (as is generally the case). The morals that are not yours. Whom do they really serve? The institutions that everyone notices they have fail and yet most continue to serve them. Why? How can this possibly be? <br />These are just some of the issues dealt with in Emma's essays.<BR>A classic book that will basically reprogram your brain if you honestly think about the issues in it. But reprogrammed into what? Well, it will only reprogram you into thinking for yourself. For once. If you do, you'll find that the illusion you've been living in does indeed serve someone. Your long hard road to becoming an individual will thus commence.	2003-12-21

Approaching its 40th anniversary, Heinlein's book remains controversial and thought provoking. This means that, all debate aside, it has stood (so far) the test of time.<BR>   While many reviewers point out that the message(s) thrust forward in the book are just a reflection of the flower generation of the 60s, these same reviewers forget that many of theose 60s issues remain debatable, unsolved and in due course with the times. I dont belong in that generation nor am I wishing to defend its causes but i do find that many of the ideas promoted in that decade are just as valuable today, and indeed, maybe even more so.<BR>  <BR>   The story, a sci-fi epic about a martian who is taken back to earth as (basically) a prisoner only to be forced to escape and thus be given the chance to bring forth his ideas from his alien culture (pun intended here). Ideas, which include extreme (even for today's standards) sexual freedom and subversiveness, dissent and questioning of established institutions and a plethora of philosophical rebellions such as the meaning of love and friendship, the substance of community life and the reason we have \\"societies\\".<BR>   Heinlein doesnt only use the martian as a mouthpiece for his cause. Even more impressive and powerful is the irksome character of dr.Jubal who becomes initially the martian's protector, provides his hideout and uses his everpresent connections and intelligence to give the alien a setting where he can function on his own and take over the story. Jubal's frequent monologues which are disguised as answers in dialogue to various conversators are not only masterful and intimidating but reveal a very fresh sense of humor and keep you halting to think. I thought often that Jubal is the center stage of this story and he's the source of all provocation for the reader but as well as for the other members of the plot.<br />   There are objections to Heinlein's views and some are indeed well founded. You will come upon puzzling misogynistic and also homophobic commentary. Having said that, i'd add that i find it hard to imagine from myself accepting such statements but Heinlein has an agenda that, hmm, demands seeing the sum of the thoughts, criticizing the mistakes, but nevertheless accepting the provocation of \\"Stranger in a strange land\\" for what it is: effective.<BR>   Other than that the sci-fi imagery of this book does seem dated in today's high-paced hi-tech world but there's few sci-fi novels from that or from even older eras that read convincingly on that level today.<BR>   Overall, it is not only a glimpse into the mindset of 4 decades ago but also a glimpse in matters that still remain unanswered today.<BR>   Highly reccommendable and highly controversial.	2003-12-19

Many memes form memeplexes and memeplexes in turn form behaviors. The more powerful a meme is the better its chances to be &quot;hosted&quot; (accepted) and thus spread regardless of its usefullness or not and regardless of its &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness&quot;: if it's strong enough it will be replicated and spread.<BR>   This, in a nutshell, is the theory about memes and memetics presented in this book.<BR>   <BR>   In my opinion it doesnt take too much convincing for this theory to appear pivotal in the process of understanding the works of the human brain. It is so strikingly obvious that this is exactly what's going on in the every day wars of the minds around &quot;our&quot; world that what is actually interesting is to what extend this process stretches.<BR>   And while S.Blackmore does a great job in laying out her theory and explaining memetics she does eventually fall into the great trap such scientific theories are prone to: overgeneralising  and dogmatising.<BR>   To an extend, memetics do provide an adequate explanation for human behavior, but on the other hand, they leave certain areas as dark as they were before memetics were conceived. For example, memetics do not provide an explanation as to why memes that actually work towards our self-destruction as a species get copied anyway. Stating that they are replicated because &quot;they are strong&quot; is too simplistic because<BR>a) masses of people might not replicate such memes yet they do prevail because of the structure of our societies<BR>b) what does it say about our &quot;intelligence&quot; (the very same intelligence that helps us understand memes) ifwe do indeed copy self-destructful memes?<BR>   It is especially about this second question that this book and in general the theory about memetics fails to be fulfilling the way memetists would wish for.<BR>   I would personally have no problem to entertain the idea that our &quot;intelligence&quot; is way overrated and that our brains are majorly flawed but such an idea is not offered to me as an option in this book, and not only that, but the exact opposite is basically at times claimed and at other times implied in the &quot;Meme machine&quot;.<br />   Memes do exist (massively so) and do influence what we are and what we do (undeniably so). But where is the line drawn and is there such a line?<BR>  Memetists state that such a line probably does not exist and that memes are directly and solely responsible for every human behavior that we see around us. That would be too holistic and too nihilistic at the same time. Why do i say that?<BR>  Well, for starters it is actually totally hilarious that we are actually a species that admits it can only use a sorry 5% of its brain and yet with this 5% it claims to understand the other 95% as well. Memetists (and scientists alltogether) seem to somehow overlook this &quot;tiny&quot;, &quot;little&quot; detail not only when they examine the human brain but also when they take on other, bigger (??) issues on, such the universe and so forth.<BR>   The theory that seems to be a great dogmatic aspect of our current science: &quot;there's only what meets the eye&quot; (and memetics stands on exactly that premise when you analyse it down to its core) is one that never convinced me and actually, the more i read and acquire what little knowledge i can as a human  the more inplausible it becomes. <br />   This is not the view of a theist (I'm very far from that) but the view of a realist, whatever realism my personal 5% usage of my brain allows me to.<br />   Understanding what memes are and how they work will help you understand our current predicaments more than anything. The fact that most of the time we imitate without discrimination, without applying judgement is obvious but is it our nature? What if we taught children how to NOT imitate in such a pathetic way or how to filter and process every single thought that goes or gets created in their brains? What would happen then and where would that put the whole memetics theory? <br />   To finish things off, i do recommend this book. I do in no way recommend to accept it in the overwhelmingly dogmatic fashion it presents itself.<BR>   Memetics are useful and we need them in our effort to understand. But if we try to turn them into another scientific religion we will achieve the exact opposite.	2003-12-18

First of all we all are opinionated about what's to come even in the not so close future. It's natural, it belongs in human sense to try and foresee where we are going because projecting helps us avoid mistakes, or, helps us &quot;correct&quot; our steering.<br />  Huxley, more than half a century ago sees a society heading to a world full of cloned non-individuals who are conditioned with scientific (and horrifying methods) from childhood to behave in specific ways and fulfil specific &quot;social missions&quot; or &quot;assignments&quot;. There's no free thought except for inside the frames you have been planned for and the illusion that your thoughts are indeed your own.<br />  People (or the clones that inhabit Huxley's Brave New World) are born and kept into chambers where messages are repeated to them 100s or 1000s of times until these messages become a mentality that the clone sees as his own. Arts have been reduced to more scientific propaganda where there is no message to be conveyed except for the &quot;feel good&quot; effect that keeps things &quot;quiet&quot;, there is no objections and no critique because as the clones are very well convinced &quot;what is there to criticize&quot;.<br />  For those with the occasional lapse in &quot;reasoning&quot; there is 'Soma' , a wonder drug which everyone takes and which soothes down your tendencies of questioning or depression. The uniformity is ruthless and anyone who (somehow) manages to step out of line is sent &quot;away&quot;, usually in some place with rebels similar to him where conditions are harsh and opportunities for survival are scarce.<br />  This is summarily Brave New World as seen by Huxley and if we try, or as we keep trying to see whether he did indeed have a point we can only compare with what we currently got. This is the only safe passage to a &quot;safe&quot; conclusion.<br />  In that respect Huxley proves to be frightengly right even if the current methods dont seem similar to the ones described in his book (but who's to say they wont become such?).<br />  While uniformity in today's society might not seem all-encompassing it's not in Huxley's book either. Today, people might not be conditioned from birth in chambers with countless repeated messages but they are conditioned through a uniform school system with uniformed dogmas. They then keep being conditioned with centrally controlled media and any objection or tendency for questioning is similarly thrashed by the weight of &quot;public opinion&quot; which is of course not the product of individual thought.<br />  And as for the wonder-drug 'Soma'?<br />While we might not have a wonder-drug (yet) we have a plethora of other drugs which we all (or almost all) take for exactly the same reasons may those be alcohol, cigarettes, softer drugs, or harder or even the omnipresent anti-depressants which are becoming as common in use as alcohol.<br />  What about the feel good arts, the 'feelies' as they are descibed in Huxley's book? Go into any record store and look at the charts. If you still have any objectional, individual thought in you, you wont see anything but message-less, critique-less, thoughtless art that only wishes to calm you down, to soothe you like a 'feelie' would. Sure, music that doesnt fit those lows exist but are you &quot;trained&quot; to find it or are you &quot;conditioned&quot; to understand it? The same applies for books or for movies.<br />  Being that this is a review for a book and not a sociological analysis (which would probably take not one but many other books to start with) I'll keep it simple:<br />  Huxley is indeed accurate in what he foresees based on his times. And while this development is not (or is it?) fully developed yet, while it will probably geta lot worse before it ever gets any better, the point remains the same. Had Huxley been living today and tried to write the same book i dont see how it could've been any different. If anything it would only be more scary or more discouraging concerning our course as a species what with cloning now being reality and not sci-fi anymore and with science being even more a servant to those that pull the strings for &quot;our own good&quot;.<br />  Some reviewers here say that the author is not charismatic or that literally looking at it he's a mediocre writer that has a powerful idea but doesnt know how to lay it out well. There might be a degree of truth in all of these claims but, in my humble opinion, with such books this is totally besides the point.<br />  Huxley wants to express a fear, an angst, that not only he has, but many of us, before him, and after him. This is strikingly obvious. In in that &quot;mission&quot; of his he succeeds beyond any doubt because the present serves as hardcore evidence for his claims.<br /><br />  Along with '1984' by Orwell this book is not simply a &quot;dystopian&quot; classic but a great sociological analysis disguised as a novel. Its value is more than meets the eye especially when one thinks that our eye is not trained to meet much.t a lot worse before it ever gets any better, the point remains the same.

Judging from most of the reviews here I'm obviously going against the flow, which is bizzare since one of the reasons i decided to read Heller's book was exactly the fact that most reviewers are raving about it. Oh well, there's a lesson to be learned here somewhere.<br />    &quot;Catch 22&quot; is considered a classic but in my mind &quot;classics&quot; are books of the caliber of &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;The Stand&quot;, books that hold up in time and deliver their message in a way that isnt anachronistic. &quot;Catch 22&quot; does not belong in such an &quot;elite&quot; category. <BR>   It's supposedly &quot;hilarious&quot; but that's a very emphatic statement to make about humour and, hmm, i hardly laughed with it. Sure, humour is (as are many concepts) just a matter of perspective but from my angle of the world this was hardly enough to make you grin. Another paradox is that many readers claim you &quot;have to be well read&quot; to like this or (even stranger) you &quot;have to read this if you want to be well read&quot;.<BR>  This is absolutely untrue. What is actually true is that the more you've read the less the chances become you'll be thrilled by &quot;Catch 22&quot; and if you are not &quot;well read&quot; (which is hard to define anyway) &quot;Catch 22&quot; wont add too much to your thinking arsenal except in my opinion the obvious.<BR>   <BR>    So what is the obvious here?<br />   Heller goes into an overlengthy diatribe to deliver an antiwar message decorated with philosophy bits and some provocative thoughts. While he tries to bring forth the insanity of war he does so by using incredibly underdeveloped characters, a totally ineffective plot (if one can call this a plot) and humour that tries to be subtle sarcasm but fails completely as:<BR>   -if it's subtle i`t's so subtle it's almost invisible, and<BR>   - if it's sarcasm it's so harmless that it causes little concern to its targets.<br />I wont go into the story or the characters as many other reviewers have covered that in 1000s of reviews here. What i will add is this: &quot;Catch 22&quot; is painfully boring to read, it becomes almost a task as you go through the first 50-100 pages and you find the same concepts over and over repeated and what is supposed to be a &quot;storyline&quot; thinnning continuously until it almost dissapears. If all &quot;classics&quot; were like this my take is that literature could easily become mental torture.<br />   What i find even sadder is that Heller fails while actually delivering an important message. This only drives home the fact that you might have the right thoughts but this doesnt mean you can express them in a literary way. Heller would be probably better off had he written a straight philosophical book which would have been way more in his element. As it is he takes a shot at literature and doesnt miss as he hits the target head on and the victim expires.<BR>   All a matter of perspective as i said, but i would advise you to take a good look at both the negative and the positive reviews about &quot;Catch 22&quot; before you decide whether to read it or not. You'll be surprised how completely contradicting they are. Hilarious and boring dont exactly go together. If, however, you do go on and read it dont be surprised if you find that you're forcing yourself through it.	2003-12-09

I bought (out of pure curiosity) his &quot;Far side Gallery 5&quot;. The rest was basically the same that happened to anyone who ever came into contact with the Far Side: i became a harcore addict.<br />I've read all the collections i could get my hands on and eversince Larson retired his pen I haven't been able to find a comic as subversive as this or as funny as this (with the possible exception of Dilbert but on a different dimension).<br />   This box containing all the far Sides plus a whooping 1100 unpublished strips must be the wet dream of every Larson fan.<BR>   Gary Larson has got the charisma that all great comic makers have: he has the ability to see the world from a completely different angle, may that be upside down, inside-out, from above or from way below. Whichever the case, those that are well broken into the Far Side sense of humor know well what I mean.<BR>  <BR>    For those that are not familiar with Larson (and man, if i ever said you're missing out and meant it big time then this is the time) do yourself a massive favor and pick this up. It's the only drug i know printed on paper.<br />    Other than that, and considering the rather juicy price this gorgeously packaged collection is rather intended for the die-hard fans, allthough i know no Far Side fan who's anything less than die-hard.<BR>   I also predict that even though most of us Larsonites probably own most if not all of the stuff on the market by Larson this box will achieve some bulky sales too.<br />   Possibly the funniest comic series in recent memory (and, uhm, my memory goes way back) and at the same time the work of a great artist (great drawing) and a master with plots as his captions are exemplary of making your comic idea work.<BR>   A super-must...	2003-11-17

A movement, that, through a massive network of action that ranged from strikes against brutally oppressing regimes that inevitably and repeatedly resulted in massive bloodbaths, direct action, informing people about their present future and past while actually opening up to them a whole new world of possibilities that would drive them out of their every day misery and into a new situation where through thriving freedom the society would transform.<BR>    Bookchin introduces the readers (as he had to) to some of anarchy leading theoriticians (and practicians) such as Bakoonin and their influence on the Spanish anarchists while he goes into exhaustive detail highlighting internal conflicts concerning differing anarchistic tendencies as well as the ones against socialists (who more than often proved to be disguised conservatives) and of course against the establishment itself and its organs of suppresion.<BR>   It's a back n' forth story he tells as well, as the struggle of the spanish anarchists to establish themselves at the front for social change (\\"not tomorrow, now!\\" said the pickets at the massive protests and demos) was often sunk in blood, often thrown back by mass executions, often took a step backwards because the need for biological survival took a priority or simply because disapointment would momentarily settle in before a new spark would \\"detonate\\" the movement again.<br />   The history of the spanish anarchists is remarkable in more ways than initially obvious. In a very intense sense it proves that the philosophy of anarchy doesnt demand from anyone to be well educated in order to comprehend it. \\"Absolute\\" freedom is not a complex concept and everything that derives from it is equally simple. It doesnt recquire reading bulky volumes of economic politics that lead nowhere nor trying to improve a system within which has already failed from the get-go (capitalism). It demands the \\"impossible\\" but simoultaneously the natural.<BR>   While Bookchin writes in a rather heavy style that wont easily grab you, he's an incredible historian who leaves no stone unturned in his effort-mission to explain thoroughly a historical event. That is my only objection to this book.<br />    Other than that, this is more than recquired reading for anyone interested in anarchism (here, its history )or in examining political philosophies in general.It would help if you started from Emma Goldman's \\"Essays on anarchy\\" before this if your knowledge of this philosophy is somewhat superficial.	2003-11-14

As a certified S.O.B (Seriously Obsessive Bibliophile), i have to say that this one qualifies with flying colors as a major \\"cantputdowner\\".<BR>Jail? Doin' time? There's a big selection of books out there about this dark issue. Many of them very good. \\"You got nothing coming\\" beats them all in my humble opinion, not because:<BR>-its story is original<BR>-you'll read anything in here you havent heard, read, or seen in movies about the prison system before<br />but for reasons unpredicted when picking up a book about incarceration, such as:<BR>-its beyond top-level humor and sarcasm<BR>-its mix of corporate training and jail code to survive<br />But more to the specifics. Reading a book written by a former (or current) convict is usually a bitter, heartbreaking experience. It's bound to be. Being in prison doesnt normally inspire the most optimistic feelings on behalf of the author if you know what I mean.<BR>   Jimmy Lerner (the author), up until the moment of landing in a hardcore Nevada prison, is a constantly recovering alcoholic, part time prescription drug addict, hard trying loving father, formerly married, hard working (professionally \\"succesful\\") corporate man who is about to even make it to the big time.<BR>   All this becomes a not so distant blur of the past as his precariously balanced life takes a turn for the worst, when he winds up strangling a drug dealer in -more than obvious- self defense.<BR>   Perhaps predictably, the system isnt too impressed with his crudentials and he lands a sentence of 2 to 12 years.<BR>   <BR>  As if that wasnt going to be enough of a shock, his very first cellmate is a heavy-framed nazi skinhead who also happens to be a major play-caller in the prison. All around him, the environs dont look much better as the \\"population\\" is made up of all kinds of gangs with an ominous set of issues. And he - the author- is the \\"fish\\" who along with the rest of the convicts \\"has nothin' comin'\\". Clueless, at first, to the realities, the bizzare code, the surreal \\"morals\\" and everyday horrors of life in prison, as well as the  the impending threat to one's bodily safety if not overall existence, the \\"fish\\" begins an upward struggle to survive using...psychology techniques he learned in the corporate seminars he'd attended (where he was paying attention as he admits).<br />    Does it work? Most of the time it shockingly does allthough he seems to be \\"lucky\\" in his misfortune as more than once he has uncomfortably close brushes with seriously unpleasant experiences (such as being stabbed in broad daylight in the \\"yard\\", or, coming close to being run over by a 250 pound con who feels he's been \\"disrespected\\"). Oh, and all that, without his nazi skinhead cellmate having discovered that J.Lerner is a ...Jew.<br />   Written in hilarious style, with incredible (considering the circumstances) humor and wit, \\"You got nothing coming\\" shouldnt be regarded as just another prison story novel, but rather, as one of the most powerful true-story novels to have come out in recent memory.<br />   Indeed, I couldnt point to another book that has the ability to keep you contineously suspended between terror and laughter. That would be because it would take incredible talent from the part of the author. Lerner not only possesses that talent but he does so in abundance.<BR>   At the same time, Lerner emerges as a powerful human being. Not in the muscle sense most of his inmates are but inside. He deals with a situation, which, considering the circumstances, would lead other men (or women) to their ultimate downfall, with intelligence, mental but mostly emotional.<br />   It's not exactly simple to feel like you're dealing with a crowd of psychos (or soon to be psychos), may they be inmates or guards, while you are their sole \\"therapist\\". Lerner might not sense it that way, but thats what he ultimately does: he functions as a psychologist treating simoultaneously 300 patients.<BR>    Miraculously (for his own sake) it seems to work.<BR>    I read \\"You got nothing coming\\"  in a period of little of 2 days (over 360 pages of it) simply because once i started it i found it to be so gripping and compelling i couldnt bring myself to put it down. Funny as hell and more hellish than hell, dark enough to put the lights out in your most illuminated optimisms, threatening in an omnipresent way and bitter the way only prison books can be, this book is nothing less than a msterpiece in its own right.<BR>     One of the most impacting books I've ever layed my eyes on.	2003-11-12
US	47065451	R1KZFX2VCCTW9W	0486421333	548340681	The Book of the Damned (Dover Occult)	Books	5	16	17	N	N	Scepticism for starters: the trippy mind of Charles Fort	Hailed as the man who kick-started modern day scepticism for the findings and conclusions of mainstream science, Charles Fort is actually a man who is paid more tribute now than ever before with the advent of alternative archaeology and science in general and with more and more people (researchers, scientists or not) actually doubting some of our more precious scientific dogmas.<br />This book is a celebration of humor as well as scepticism, the humor part being the one which most people have greatly misunderstood about C.Fort.<br />Fort takes literally 100s of examples of bizzare unexplained  phenomena such as things falling from the sky (ranging from frogs or fish to metal objects) to spontaneous combustion, to unidentified flying objects, to time travel among others and actually exposes science's comical &quot;answers&quot; to these phenomena.<br />  Frogs that have been rained by the sky or fish for that matter are not a phenomenon that has stopped. It still happens. The &quot;official explanation&quot; remains as hilarious as it was back in Fort's times, namely: a hurricane or a whirlwind picks them up and &quot;rains&quot; them somewhere else. However, why these winds are selective in what they pick up remains unaswered by science.<br />The usual and continuing up to this day explanation about UFOs which concerns mass illusion or the classic &quot;weather baloon&quot; explanation is picked up by Fort and given the ridiculing treatment it deserves.<br />  What makes Fort such a classic and cult figure is his ability to use subtle (mostly) but lethal sarcasm to debunk the dogmatic and more than often funny explanations that scientists offer when cornered with occurences that dont fit or even shutter their sacred theories.<br />  Fort's intention is none other than to highlight our trait of mixing cluelessness with arrogance and at the same time to trigger openmindedness or more importantly thinking for oneself and not religiously depending on science to shape the answers so that they fit the question.<br />  The problem that Fort brings out with the &quot;Book of the damned&quot; is one that persists today as well. With Darwinistic theories being heavily challenged, with the Bing Bang theory being literally taken apart by daring scientists, and with Quantum physics proving that the &quot;unthinkable&quot; might actually be very thinkable indeed it's the Fortean spirit celebrated all over again on a grand scale.<br />Fort's critics (and they aren't few) take his theories the way they take the theories of mainstream science as well: for granted. Fort offers in this book for example a theory of a &quot;super Sargasso sea&quot; where all these living organisms keep falling from. One would have to be tremendously lacking in humour  or imagination not to gather that Fort is yanking the collective chain here. What he does say in reality is: &quot;if you can offer such a ridiculous theory about this phenomenon (insert unexplained phenomenon here) then i might as well add my own which by no means is less or more serious but it's nevertheless just as unproven as yours&quot;.<br />  It's as simple as that really and Fort uses this technique repeateadly in his &quot;Book of the damned&quot; calling damned those who &quot;dare&quot; refuse official dogma.<br />  There has been much criticism as well concerning the overwhelming bulk of paradigms that Fort uses in this book and the critics are probably right in this case. There was no need for such volume as the point would easily get across with 1/3 of these examples.<br />  But that aside, this is in fact a book way, way ahead of its time.<br />  It's funny how a man can be thrown to the pyre exactly because he uses his humour to dismiss our fear of not being able to explain the world around us. It's even funnier that we keep insisting we can despite alarming failures.<br />  The &quot;Book of the damned&quot; is a grand example of a brave mind. The problem with brave minds is that they are usually shoved under the gigantic rug tagged &quot;truth&quot; for a very long time before anyone recognises their impact.hey are usually shoved under the gigantic rug tagged &quot;truth&quot; for a very long time before anyone recognises their impact.	2003-11-09

To begin with, I give this book 4 stars and not 5 because it would be arrogant of me to offer the highest mark when i happen to have only surface knowledge on the majority of the issues this books deals with. Having said that, i find it comical if not outright hilarious that certain people give one star because that would imply they can actually take every argument this book offers apart! Now, for those that have actually read the Sirius Mystery thesis, we're talking about not one argument here, but dozens which this researcher uses to put together a central argument. This would mean that the people who are burying this book are ultra-masters of archaeology, mythology, astronomy and history. Well, guess what: they are not. Guess again: no such masters exist (R.Temple included) and all that is going on is that we're basically trying to battle our cluelessness of our origin and history and as we do we find out that the mysteries we need to explain are by no means easy tasks.<BR>    The Piri Reis maps? Water erosion on the Sphinx? Come again? Noone, certainly not mainstream science has offered adequate explanations (to put it mildly) about these mysteries and the same goes about the human origin. No need to mention the ever eluding missing link, is there?<BR>   Why do i give this book 4 stars myself then? I'll hold that explanation, if i may, for the end of this review.<br />    For the \\"uniinitiated\\", Robert Temple trigers his research by starting from the FACT that a tribe called Dogon in Africa happens to have knowledge about the Sirius star system they are not supposed to have i.e that Sirius A is \\"hiding\\" in its orbit a Sirius B and possibly a Sirius C (recently confirmed much to the dismay of the fanatical opposition Temple was met with, very unsurprisingly), or that Sirius B is a \\"heavy star\\" i.e a very dense star.<br /> Now, when this knowledge by the Dogon was revealed to the western world (through the work of 2 French anthropologists) many of the things claimed by the ancient tradition of the Dogon were not known by western astronomers. In fact, only years later it became evident for western \\"science\\" (the same science that used to think the earth was flat, and the same \\"science\\" that only 300 years ago disputed that theere is blood circulation in the human body-!!!!- among many other such \\"scientific\\" facts) that the Dogon beliefs were solid.<br />    Before i go on, i would like to laugh out loud at the ultragullible folk who think the Dogon took this knowledge from western expeditioners as Carl Sagan ridiculously suggested. I mean, what's the scenario here people? Western expeditioners show up to the Dogon and the first thing they decide to brainwash them with is stories about the Sirius star system which they themselves did NOT have? I mean, are some of you that irrational? And how does it go on according to you then? That the Dogon lost no time in constructing a religion out of something so abstract i.e a star they could NOT see from stories some white people told them that they couldnt possibly prove???? Nice one, but i've heard better jokes, and frankly, this is hardly a laughing matter, it's actually bitter how some will cling to hardly proven theories about our origins no matter how sad their outtake is...<br />    But on to the book and excuse me for the above parenthetical argument but i simply couldnt resist it.<br />   What Temple is forced to do after he presents us with what the Dogon know, is to backtrack. He has to do this because there is indeed more than enough evidence that such bizzare references (as the Dogon's) are to be found in other ancient cultures as well, namely the Sumerians, Egyptians and the Greeks. His \\"hunch\\" proves to be very revealing as Temple searches through these ancient cultures because he does actually highlight not a few but a plethora of such references, symbolisms and -mostly- myths that contribute to his argument.<br />    Did i say myths? Whoa. Touchy little subject those myths. Those who consider themselves serious studiers of all theories concerning our tortured origin must've discovered by now that mythology is nothing else than a brilliantly devised method the ancients used to preserve knowledge. Whoa again, because knowledge does include history and in the absence of books the ancients basically coded history into mythology. Is Temple the only one who has uncovered this mega-fact? Not even close.<br />   The author then, needs to trouble us with a lengthy diatribe where he delves into ancient mythology and he focuses for that matter in the medditteranean basin. That's a seriously difficult part of the book to get through. You will be bombarded with dozens of ancient gods, dozens of ancient myth comparisons, massive amounts of etymology, and a fair share of speculations and conclusions. The reward if you stay with the book is tremendous. <br />   Temple doesnt pull his conclusions out of thin air no matter how \\"outworldly\\" these conclusions might be to some. His work is spectacularly researched and supported, and yes, he actually pulls the evidence for the support he needs from mainstream science. His massive bibliography is there to see.<br />    The issue remains whether , at the end, you are ready to entertain the notion that the origin of our civilisation is indeed extraterrestrial, or, to be more to the point here, whether Temple convinces with his arguments.<br />    Allow me to say, that it will take a lot more than Temple's book to be convinced about that, if that is actually the truth. Let's not forget that he's not the first researcher that makes such claims or draws such conclusions.<BR>   In my opinion, and knowing that our \\"mainstream\\" science doesnt exactly have a history of excellence when it comes to its field record, i would suggest that each theory forwarded by any researcher, no matter how \\"wild\\" it might be, is given the appropriate  attention.<BR> <BR>   Has Temple been disproven? Hardly. Actually, recent discoveries by our brilliant scientists have only confirmed parts of his theory. <br />   I'm not saying that I, for one, am 100% convinced by what Temple suggests. I'm not unconvinced either, indeed I think that he does a stunning job of laying out his theory and his arguments, and to quote an Arab philosopher \\"i believe in very little but i disbelieve in even less\\".<BR>   That is the reason i give this book 4 stars. Based solely on the convcincingness factor of the author's way of argumentation which i found pretty damn strong.<br />    This book, as other books of that \\"line\\" as well, can or should be used as pieces to a puzzle, a puzzle which we do not know what it looks like and where it will finally (if we ever solve it) take us. If the truth interests us, if it honestly does, then hysteric rants against any theories that threaten our sacred dogmas have no place in searching for any origin, ours, or the universe's...<BR>    \\"The Sirius mystery\\" is a difficult book, but a very compelling, a very impressive one at that. Until the theory contained in it is disproven hold the noise of the rants down. And read it...Read it actually through.	2003-11-04

Upon his return he writes his observations in a book intended to be read by his tribe members.<BR>    This book (translated by a german anthropologist) is a stunningly accurate study on western civilisation, as accurate as any of &quot;our&quot; scientists (sociologists, psychologists etc) could ever make. <BR>Furthermore, the observations the Samoan leader makes are characterised by a strickingly obvious &quot;innosence&quot; (and innocense here is very discussable as a term) and an even more stricking honesty.<br />    This Samoan who travels over the ocean to come and &quot;study&quot; us has no scientific interest in his mission. His motive is that he feels that his tribe is threatened  by the influence of the &quot;Papalagi&quot; which he deems destructive. Exactly because this Samoan wants to talk to his people from a position of someone who can justify why he feels threatened he come sto Europe intent to watch every little detail, every motion, everything that the Papalagi does. He attempts to explain all that he sees, doesnt stay on the surface, goes beneath it, and applies (naturally) the Samoan philosophy on life to criticise.<br />    And what critique this is indeed. Relentless, mercilles, ruthless.<BR>    The Samoan leader observes that the Papalagi and his &quot;civilisation&quot; is heavily deseased. He observes that the white man is obsessed with illusions, obsessed with things that keep eluding him either because they dont exist or because the Papalagi has made an art out of misintepreting mostly everything on this world.<br />    But what makes this &quot;warning book&quot; even more interesting is the mostly unintentional humor that keeps eminating through its pages.<BR>   Most of the things the Samoan sees are brand new to him. In his effort to make whatever sense there is about them he uses a descriptive language that will smoothen out the bitterness of his comments because at times it's hilarious.<BR>   Us, the &quot;papalagi&quot; dont get many chance to hear what an &quot;alien&quot; thinks about us and how he sees us.

A lot of people are spooked even upon hearing the term &quot;meditation&quot;. There's a &quot;good&quot; reason for that since meditation is connected (or associated) with &quot;complicated&quot; philosophies and practices and the average person that he/she is either not up to par for such a task (not mentally equipped?) or simply lacks the time.<br />   This book should've been named &quot;meditation for beginners&quot;. It doesnt delve into any depthness but does offer the ground to start.<BR>    Meditation is a practice that should begin from a simple level and evolve into something more complete and more rewarding.<BR>    It would probably be uneducated to expect someone who has never meditated to dive into the depths of the Kabbalah or any of the eastern philosophies and their meditations techniques right from the get-go. That would be impossible.<br />   For the person who seeks to explore what he can accomplish for himself with meditation this is not a bad book. What it offers is a basic technique for meditating which will have basic results for that matter. What is involved in this technique is simple visualisation and self-hypnosis and a step by step guide on how to achieve it.<BR>    <BR>    Start here with this book and take it further. You will find out that the subject itself will demand from you to eventually take it to another level.	2003-11-03

Ok, for those interested in the subject: if you expect to read all about aliens, conspiracies about strange beings governing from below, strange otherwordly craft being tested, or any such info, well, choose another book if this is what you seek.<br />If you happen to be a planespotter this book should be precisely right for your money. Furthermore, if you're looking for the purely conventional history of &quot;area 51&quot; then you've hit the bull's eye as well. <BR>But this calls for some specification here. It all comes down to what you're ready to assume, believe, expect. Area 51 may have an unconventional side to it and it may not. This is all extremely open to discussion and anyone who has delved deep into all this phenomenon will know very well that this subject could span to lenghts and depths unimaginable. If it comes down to purely concrete evidence then area 51 remains a blurry subject, more so that other sides of the bigger scheme for which way more evidence exists.<br />Now, summing it all up, i find the cover of this book ridiculously misleading. Why put an alien on the cover if this precisely what you are NOT talking about inside this book??? This alone, leads me to thoughts it shouldnt lead me, it puts me in suspicion about the motives of the author. If you're going to go on for 400 some pages explaining that all that area 51 is is a secret giant facility for testing secret (but earthling made!) aircraft than what's with the alien hint on the cover mr.Patton? <br />I found myself reading an extremely interesting book about the history of fighting aircraft, stealth aircraft, cold war intrigues, test pilots of dangerous aircraft etc. For this i rate this book highly. But i still think that it doesnt address the ever-underlying question about &quot;other&quot; functions of the so called area 51. &quot;Dreamland&quot; does touch this underlying question but in a vrey superficial and selfunderstood dismissing way as if it was never an issue to begin with. Problem is, it IS an issue, and there are enough reasons for that (wrong or right, they aren't adequately dealt with in the book, to put it mildly).	2003-10-27

It's not a book that you read once and immediately achive something. It couldn't be possibly meant that way. It's a book to keep coming back to for life, one you'll refer to and embrace for as long as you're alive, one you'll understand slowly, piece by piece, sometimes verse by verse as you gather experience bad or good.<br />    The incredible thing about it is that its &quot;wisdom&quot; is based on overwhelmingly simple premises, so simple and yet for most people (sadly so) so incredibly hard to grasp. That's a thought that will occur to you many times while reading through these poems: &quot;hey, this sounds so simple and feels so right, but it seems everyone i know including myself is doing the exact opposite&quot;..<br />    Human nature will also occur to you as a basic theme while discovering the foundations of Taoistic philosophy through Lao Tzu..Is our nature much like that of a computer where someone can programm us in whichever flase way and then we have to invest a whole lifetime's worth to deprogramm ourselves back to simplicity? <br />    The premise of &quot;take things as they come&quot; or more importnatly &quot;dont interfere&quot; is a repeated one in Tao Te Ching. Now, this thought is the hardest to grasp and it hides beneath it a huge, massive underlying philosophy on life in general which in turn contains the secret to the survival of this species. Heavy statement? Possibly so, but then again once you start thinking simple you go through a somewhat psychedelic cycle of &quot;simple-very complicated-back to simple.<br />The simple HAS to occur in anyone's mind before anything else that comes close to complicated can be taken up as a thought. The opposite process, the one we put our children through at schools is one that mathematically leads to mass confusion and mass failure: individualistic failure and societal failure.<BR>     We have come to the point where simplicity has to be retaught to us. What's worse than that is that we have to venture 1000s of years back and take up philosophy and poecy as old as the winds to achive this. That, at least to em, sounds pretty scary. But it might be our only way out of the predicament our modern &quot;civilised&quot; world has come to.	2003-09-03

Anyone who has lived in a city will recognise the stories narrated in this book even if he's never come to direct contact with the type of characters depicted in them.<BR>  It's an instinctive recognition though. I grew up part of my life in Queens N.Y and while reading through this book i felt that these were stories i heard as a kid being screamed through my window.<BR>  <BR>    Shelby is not using any imagination in the \\"Last exit...\\" but this isn't his talent to begin with. His talent is being an impeccable \\"watcher\\", he has watched the world around him and he's been able to describe it with brutal accuracy, much like a camera filming riots or the daily life of anyone. You cant argue much with a camera and Shelby functions very much like a human one, simply or \\"simply\\" reproducing the reality we all love to ignore on paper.<br />    It's certainly a world with very lil love or compassion to offer, the one Shelby describes, but for anyone who thinks this might be somewhat exaggerated i'd have to say this: look again and this time with your eyes open.<BR>    He chooses unmistakebly dark characters for his stories: prostitutes, dark dealers, cryptohomosexuals who lead the \\"normal\\" life on the surface and the such, but his knife cuts way deeper when he opts for the \\"guy next door\\" character, the one who lives in -again- \\"normal hell\\", the one who spends his life in an agony of pointless routine, who lives but doesnt live, who is there but he might've just as well (for his/her) sake not existed.<br />    ....<BR>   This is what the \\"Last exit...\\" is all about.<BR>   <BR>    The schemes, the vanities, the shortcomings of the many different characters involved in Shelby's stories are maybe nothing you havent at least heard before, but do trust me, they do make up for one massive horror story.<BR>   Now, speaking of a horror story, horror film [fans] on reality. This applies spot on with this book.<BR>   It's a dark world out there, and no matter what your personal situation might be (even if it coincidentally is a lil better than the next guy's) there's no need painting it with rosy colors. It's what it is, and Shelby comes through with a disarming honesty about it. His first intention might not be honesty itself but you'll find it hard to fault him for what he chooses to bring to the surface.<br />    The narrative style of this book is nothing short of genius, especially considering the time it was written. In a sense, picking your narrative style when writting a bok is very much like casting actors for a film. Cast the wrong ppl and the film goes down the drain, choose the wrong narrative technique and there goes your whole book being self-trashed.<br />   Overall, if you like dark literature, if hi-fidelity reproduction of reality on paper is your thing you will be more than well served here. A true classic beyond any question.	2003-09-03

What makes this book by Colin Wilson pleasantly unpredictable is that it contains far more &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; than the &quot;usual&quot; and expected `Bermuda triangle`, FOs`, `Bigfoot`and so on. Sure enough it contains entries about those phenomena, but it goes deeper than these and explores stories such as those of Fulcanelli or Junius (both brilliant and yet unknown stories), a more detailed account on the -possibly- false identity on the man who spent 40 years in prison claiming he was Rudolph Hess (more than likely he wasnt) , a good comprehensive and all-inclusive &quot;report&quot; on whether Homer actually existed and what he really did write etc.. I read books on such matters on a systematic basis and yet i found that a good portion of the ones <BR>contained here I`d never heard before.<BR>    <BR>I`ve used quotation marks widely on the above paragraph trying to stay in line with Wilson`s -always- careful treading when he deals with theories about unsolved mysteries.<BR>   <BR>If you`re a fan of Colin Wilson you`ll find this to be another excellent contribution of his to the &quot;paranormal&quot; field of research (or to be somewhat more precise: to the not so normal field of research).<BR>   If you`re not familiar with this incredible and ultra prolific researcher this book is a great one to start from as:<BR>-it recquires no previous specialised reading on your part (Wilson will keep you in the know with several references and explanations throughout your reading)<BR>-t`s a wildly fun book even for those that might`ve never picked up a reading on such matters <BR>-and, it`s Colin Wilson.

Interesting that a book such as this is categorised as &quot;fiction&quot; when in fact it comes awefully close to the actual account of things...<BR>For anyone having read the actual historical account of the JFK case written by Jim Garrison (the D.A that officially investigated the case) &quot;Libra&quot; might seem -even- watered down, or, &quot;mild&quot;.<BR>   De Lillo overwhelms as he revives (literally, as mostly anyone associated with this case is long dead...) the characters that set the stage for Kennedy's association and takes a brave approach simoultaneously as he doesnt opt for the easy way out.<br />   It's an interesting concept the one that De Lillo undertakes: take a historical event and retell the story by letting the real characters do the talking, the living, the plotting, show them in every day life, bring biographical scenes from their lives forth and ultimately , under the guise of fiction, unfold the story again.<br />There would be objections, of course. Anyone would would try the same thing that De Lillo does here would probably come up with a different variation. Some even with a radically different one. The author of this book comes close, very close.<BR>   As a work of literature it is sometimes repetitive but it mostly wins its bet as De Lillo proves over 350 pages that he's got the charisma of reconstructing characters , but moreover, of understanding human nature and politics. Afterall, one with no understanding of human nature has no understanding of politics, thus, this had to be a given.<BR>   Allthough i would personally reccomend Garrison's book, &quot;Libra&quot; is not a bad place to start if you feel somewhat &quot;confused&quot;...	2003-08-26

Sometimes, and while reading books that deal with the Ufo-aliens-alien abduction issue i feel that i perfectly understand the &quot;nonbelievers&quot;...If you're going to read a book which purpotedly accounts for the sighting and the witnessing of an alien space craft which adducted human beings from a very central part of a city, well, then, you'd expect the author that wrote the book to have gone to greater lengths than the ones he went through.<BR>And having said that, I should add that i would count myself in as a &quot;believer&quot; (however naive and superficial if not religious such a term is)..<BR>But: when you claim that a spacecraft which was very brightly lit came to a quite central part of a city, abducted someone by elevating her and pulling her through her apartment window, and then dove into a nearby river, i would expect (and others too) that you would find way more witnesses than those accounted for in the book.<BR>Hopkins, the author, offers the abductee herself, 2 ex-secret service (?) agents, and a central political figure as witnesses. Now from these, only the real name of the abductee is used as the two agents offer whatever &quot;evidence&quot; they do on condition of anonymity and the same goes for the politician who also saw the happening. For reasons best know to the author, he claims that he couldnt find more witnesses even though that seems highly unlikely for a very populated area such as that where the incident took place. <br />As far as other evidence is concerned, he offers the hypnotism sessions he conducted with the abductee as well as some drawings and samples of sand. It's not all that shoddy as I'm describing so far though.<BR>Even with so &quot;little&quot;evidence  what Hopkins offers (if entirely true) is nevertheless compelling. You do of course have to take him at his word, but if you do, then it seems that an ultraweird sighting and abduction took place in the end of the 80's..One where an alien spacecraft totally disregarded whether it was attracting massive attention (as if it was intending to?) and went forth with its mission.<BR>   This is by no means a new &quot;feature&quot; in alien abduction literature and/or lore. During other sightings as well, craft and their crew have been &quot;acting&quot; as if they couldn't have been less bothered about attracting attention.<BR>   The one new element Hopkins offers goes beyond the sighting itself and it adds a whole new dimension to what's possibly involved in alien abductions.<BR>   Through his hypnotism sessions and subsequent crosschecking with the other 2 witnesses the author discovers a common &quot;childhood&quot; among these formerly not familiar to each other people, a common childhood that seems to be monitored by &quot;beings&quot; that all 3 witnesses recall in detail and who seem to have followed up  the whole process with an abduction at a mauch later date when one of the witnesses (a woman) has already grown to an adult. Further investigation by Hopkins shows that the other 2 witnesses may at one point also have been abducted.<br />   The possibility that another species is actually setting up &quot;separate childhoods&quot; for us, where not only are we monitored (so our behavior over a long period of time can be observed)but we are also beeing set up with future &quot;mates&quot; so the structure of human relationships can be studied in detail is -to put it ultramildly- very interesting...<br />   Overall, this is a book addressed to those who are already in &quot;familair&quot; territory with the issue. I dont see how someone who has never read such a book wont be &quot;alienated&quot; (pun intended) with the offerings in it.	2003-08-20

Alrighty, to begin with, we have the following facts:<BR>something goes and crashes in Shag Harbor and is witnessed by several people along this process. It resembles an orange intensely lit ball and seems to be under intelligent control. Local fishing botas go to the area after the \\"crash\\" (if indeed it was a crash) and the military takes up special interest on the issue as it endulges on investigating the incident itself.<br />Now all this, is documented in the local press (albeit dismissed as \\"nothing much\\") as well as in certain official files and becomes local folklore among the people in the area.<BR>Then comes this book. Which adds what to this story. Sadly, absolutely nothing. <BR>   For those interested in the phenomenon of UFOs, and especially those that have read some from the massive bulk of books out there about the matter this book here will come across as one pathetic effort to milk a mosquito, i.e., score some cash.<BR>   There's no need to try and tell you in detail what the book professes really. The author maintains that the object was indeed an alien craft and that there were possibly not one but two such objects that crashed, but, he offers zilch evidence to back up his claims.<BR>   Sceptics will say \\"as if other books offer more evidence\\". That's a sad argument too, because other books offer indeed evidence! This book doesnt.<BR>   Books like this do more harm than good because they discredit honest UFO research and authorship as they make it look like a cheap way to earn a buck based on a public that feeds on empty stories. It's not like that any anybody who takes this matter seriously knows this all too well.<BR>   Even though it comes at a very affordable price avoid this book. Spend your money on books of the genre like \\"You cant tell the people\\" or \\"Aliens\\" by Colin Wilson to name just a couple that will really offer you evidence and food for thought.<BR>   'Nuff, and probably too much, said...	2003-07-17

The horror-novel genre has been pushed and stretched to all kinds of lengths and angles in recent years, but, this having been said, a great horror novel remains what it always was: one that psychologically intimidates the reader and not one that relies on the gory effects and new ways to depict death, one that involves brilliant writting,  one where the characters are engaging you into the plot the more you go along, oh, and one that has a tremendous plot, or more specifically, a tremendously disturbing plot to go with it.<BR>   The Wasp Factory has all of the above in strong dosages.<BR>While this book has been written almost 20 years ago, I don't see why it wouldn't spawn the kind of \\"noise\\" it did if it came out today. It's that good.<BR>   The story sets its epicenter around Frank, a teenager who lives with his father on a remote Scottish island and who seems to be living in a world of his own that resembles a dimly lit nightmare.<BR>  <BR>    Frank has been \\"taking out\\" young-aged members of the family since he was a kid himself, particularly the ones that annoy his sense of order of things. Frank seems to also have a shining future as a murderer because he endulges in the art of the perfect crime early and perfectionises it as he goes along, making the 3 murders on his account all look like very unfortunate accidents.<BR>    But Frank is not as \\"simple\\" as that. Murder might be his way of solving \\"problems\\" but he's also got a philosophy about it, or to be more precise, a whole self-constructed world to base his actions upon, a world where decisions are not really his per se but they are actually taken by his very own miniature Delphi oracle: the wasp factory.<BR>   What exactly is the wasp factory? Well since the author chooses to build up the atmosphere of the book and only reveal 3/4s of the way what it exactly is I wont spoil the surprise for those that havent read the book yet.<BR>  <BR>   Furthermore, and as if all this wasn't, uhm, peculiar enough, Frank's life seems to be one big web of complications: his brother Eric has been locked up in an asylum for the lunatics (even though the average reader will, justifiably think that this is where Frank belongs too) but he's now escaped and is \\"coming home\\" in a process that has \\"showdown\\" written all over it. Then there's Frank's father, a rather mysterious figure, who seems to notice nothing strange at all going on, ever, and who goes about everyday life chores as if he's the only normal person left in Frank's immediate environment.<br />   Frank's also got a thing about rabbits and frogs with whom he has some type of secret war going on complete with weapons, strategic plans, bases, territories and domains etc. It's a merciless war at that too as you'll find out by reading the Wasp Factory.<BR>  So where does this all lead to, what is it all culminating to? To a stunningly surprise ending not like the proverbial icing on the cake but something less innocent than that, a secret that has been the impetus in Frank's life which will more than likely blow a fuse in your mind as you reach the conclusion of the story.<BR>   Written in first person with a stunning immediacy and with the imagination factor notched very high up, a claustrophobic atmosphere no doubt helped by the secluded environs of the small island Frank lives on, and encompassing you almost trapping you in its atmosphere of surreal almost hallucinatory narratings the Wasp Factory is nothing less than a masterpiece in its genre.<BR> <BR>    Ranks, along with the American Psycho and the Underground Hero, amongst the best horror novels I've ever read.	2003-07-16

I don't think i've ever been in more of a dillema about a review I've writen here in Amazon nor about a book I've read for that matter.<BR>   While a lot of people have been raving about the \\"Stand\\" being King's best book it is obvious that this is directly connected with your entire view of life (as is with many books of course).<BR>   If your take on  evil is that evil is something in the form of a man who comes from below and is called the \\"dark man\\" or the \\"devil\\" or \\"Randall Flagg\\" and who can make mean faces and have a couple of extra powers for good effect then you're holding the right book.<BR>   If your take on \\"good\\" is simpletons who believe in \\"god\\" (in this case a specific god) and who dont know how to manage without him, what's more they always expect his whimsical help offerings when the going gets tough, then, again, you're holding the right book.<BR>   If you belong in none of the above categories be patient I'll get to you by the end of this review which wont be as long as the \\"Stand\\" (over 1400 pages) i promise...<br />    The story: a virus wipes out the majority of the population of the earth, and we are looking at the few scattered survivors in America who try to get themselves together and start anew. Simoultaneously certain survivors who are immediately categorised as the \\"bad\\" characters do the same. Both \\"tribes\\" pick a town as a base and both are guided/led by central figures such as Randall Flagg (the \\"Walking Dude\\") or Mother Abigail who is very obviously a mouthpiece for god and very probably for King himself too.<br />    All this starts building up to an inevitable showdown between the armies of good and evil and you get to watch the preparations as they happen. The result? Well, lemme put it this way: the result in a fight between a world champion boxer and drunkard from your local bar would be LESS predictable than the result of the \\"Stand's\\" showdown.<br />    King's effort in this book is like a great card player choosing to deliberately play with bad cards as a challenge and see how often he can pull off wins anyway. Stunnigly for such an experiment he does pull it off but you'd need to cut him a lot of slack because the other players on the table (the readers in this case) have to play with HIS rules in order for that to happen.<br />    Explanation needed then:<BR>while this is a book that at times comes to borderline brilliance when it comes to character description and plotting (esp. with the bad characters with whom King seems to have a knack in portraying them) it is the main plot where the novel loses inches, a lot of inches in fact.<BR>   Being that that the plot is heavily religious (god, devil, belief) it automatically alienates the non religious people. So what you say? Good answer if you are religious yourself but thats like reading a book about Santa Claus which would only work if you believed or allowed yourself to believe in Santa to begin with..<br />    So why does the book work then? Well, as I said above, mainly because KIng does a tremendous job in building up his \\"baddies\\". Trashcan man in particular, as well as Lloyd and Harold are all excellent and very convincing characters. The part of the story that involves them is exactly the part where the book grabs you and doesnt let go until, well, until, the \\"good\\" characters kick in. <BR>    Those \\"good\\" characters come across as an army of simpletons with their only \\"weapon\\" being their belief in god and their guidance by Mother Abigail who is the Megasimpleton and who eventually leads them to glory. It's exactly when these characters are involved that the book starts to plummet like a Boeing with all its engines shut off.<br />    Long before such things become clear, and particularly during the first 200-300 pages of the book there's a tremendous build up to all this as we go through the part of the story where a super flu virus wipes out mostly everybody. That is possibly the best part of the \\"Stand\\" and i can very wellimagine that this part taken intact and in the hands of a less biased author would be pure marvel.<br />   Nevertheless, and kudos to King for it, i read this book through and through despite its tremendous size because when King is good he's damn good even if he mixes it up with a lot of nonsense in multihundred page book.<br />    Stories which deal with good and evil in such a childish ultranaive way are not exactly my cuppa tea especially since I've also given up believing in Santa or the Tooth Fairy long, long ago. Same reason i got bored to tears with the Lord of the Rings.<BR>   But this is exactly the dillema i meant at the beginning of this review. Despite all this, would I still reccomend this book to someone and especially someone likeminded with me?<BR>   Yes.<BR>   If you \\"allow yourself\\" (and believe me you have to) to not be bothered by the main plot and have fun instead with the subplots (and that's a lot of fun to be precise) then you're in for a good ride. That's the concession you have to make.<BR>    Interestingly, and that echoes other reviewers that I read here as well, many times everyday humdrum life is much more scarier than parts of this book. Funny cuzz this is supposed to be the ultimate disaster and the ultimate showdown between the goodies and the baddies. I hope King is right and that the ultimate will really be like this, because if it is we actually have a lot of hope.<BR>    But i seriously, seriously doubt it...	2003-06-17

Classic case where I'm forced to give one star because Amazon doesnt offer the option of giving \\"minus stars\\".<BR>   You would think (and i certainly fell for it) that with the topic such as the one this book deals with you would have a tremendous reading ahead of you, or at least, a very good shot at one.<BR>   Not even close. Melley, the author, takes this juicy issue and devoids it of all its substance. He goes on a tiring, ultraboring diatribe made up of wooden language and a pseudoscientific approach and by the time you reach (if you manage) page 50 you're about to quit and go watch some paint dry. I quit about 100 pages after that, but only because i spent money on this and i wanted to at least go as far as i could possibly tolerate it.<br />     This author deals with conspiracies as if they dont, offhand, exist, as if it's a given that it's all the product of paranoiacs and dellusionals and based on this assumption which he doesnt bother anywhere to explain he goes on to a ride of incredible trite and utter nonsense employing psychology and sociology thinking that makes it all sound plausible and argumentative.<br />     This, of course, doesnt cut it.<BR>     If you want to examine the culture of conspiracy theories, and what's more, show that it is all indeed paranoia, you would have to take the high profile theories and take them apart for what they are, or what you want to show that they are.<BR>   Like the JFK conspiracy theory for example. Melley cant seem to be bothered with the tons of evidence available anywhere from Jim Garrison's book to other books as well and websites for good measure that show that the official theory is a joke. Nope. It's all paranoia, paranoia, paranoia, and if you dont believe mr. Melley it is very possible you're paranoid too.<br />     This is exactly how this book builds up, literally on thin air, with extremely weak arguments and with an approach that a CIA agent would be proud of if he'd written such a book.<br />     While it is a fact that there IS a strong paranoia factor involved in the conspiracy theory culture, it is also a FACT that many conspiracy theories are not \\"theories\\". Anybody with a serious interest in history will attest to that.<br />    And that is exactly my point. Since conspiracy theories and their analysis involve a good backround grasp of history spend your money on some other book. The author of this one seems to have a very poor understanding as well as knowledge of history and he'll waste your time like there's no tomorrow. If you anyway think in the lines of this book you dont need to read it anyway. Just watch the news every day, rest assured you're being told the truth and  go to sleep. Applying sciences to build up a nonsensical theory is an old trick in itself and a poor one at that.<BR>    Back to my paint-drying watching...	2003-06-16

In this collection of short essays published in a span of over 30 years in various magazines, Eco takes all kinds of themes in a mood for parody and satire.<BR>    Dealt with here are various modern day commodities (phones, gadgets etc.) as well as ...trains, buses, libraries, waiters, and in general themes that  bear no connection with them ..<BR>    Reading this book through is not much different than being engaged in conversation with a very witty person who's got an opinion on everybody and everything and has a very special way to deliver it on top of it.<BR>   Some of the subjets of these essays may seem a bit out of time (times have indeed changed since some of these were written) but the humor is the prevailant factor here, a caustic humor characteristic of Eco anyway.<BR>    If you've gotten to know this brilliant author and mind through his classics such as &quot;Foucault's pendulum&quot; and &quot;The name of the rose&quot; you might find yourself surprised with what's on offer on this book. It's a style you might've not expected, but this does in no way mean you'll be dissapointed. On the extreme contrary!<BR>    Great book, reads through like a breeze, and so packed with hilarious lines/conclusion/observations that you'll surely return to it many times.	2003-06-13

For those familiar with the explorations of alternative archaelogists the word &quot;nephilim&quot; should be no new acquaintance. The debate about their origin though seems to carry on and on.<BR>    Andrew Collins has delivered here an extraordinary book when one considers the painstaking research he's invested in it. I do feel however, that he's probably arrived to the wrong conclusions.<BR>    Collins professes that the Nephilim were the giant offspring of a  preancient gigantic humanlike being that mated with humans and his research focuses on the Watchers (the Nephilim's ancestors) and the territories they lived. Remarkably, if not shockingly, he arrives at the conclusion that the Watchers originated somewhere in ancient Kazahkstan but he fails to explain their strange (to put it very mildly) features: burning, sometimes red eyes, massive in size compared to humans and with very possibly &quot;special qualities, which again humans did not and do not, possess.<BR>    What makes this book great -whether you agree or not with its conclusions- is that the trek it takes you for is full of priceless revelations and a plethora of incredible facts ranging from Asia to eastern Europe to northern Africa, revelations and facts that will put certain questions in a new perspective while they leave others still open.<BR>    I, for one, dont agree with the final analysis of &quot;From the Ashes of Angels&quot; but was astounded with what i read in it.There were certain things i read for the very first time allthough i spend quite a lot of my reading on alternative archaelogy. That should speak for itself.<BR>    On the downside, the back and forths in time that Collins uses in his book work mostly to a disadvantage as the reader finds it difficult to keep up with the historical references, or for that matter, to keep up with what Collins is trying to argumentate. This has to do mostly with the bulk of information provided (and this is one serious bulk of data) than with thetechnique of writting  itself.<BR>    I found myself comparing notes in my head with Sitchin's findings on this matter and i thought that Sitchin makes a better  more convincing argument alltogether.<BR>    However, Collins is a must-read as his other works are just as interesting and he makes a tremendous contribution to the field of alternative history.	2003-06-04

Is there more to interpreting reality than just the perceptions of your five senses? Is there indeed a \\"cosmic trickster\\" who decides to send you signals with irregular patterns about your own life?<BR>   In this fascinating book it is a reevaluation of older principles (the ancient Greek belief about lower and higher destiny for one) connected with modern psychology (C.Jung primarily) that leads to a mesmerising study of the phenomenon of synchronicities: events that we today tend to describe as \\"incredible coincidences\\" or dejavues without actually realising that there could be a meaning, a \\"code\\", which can reveal to us either things about to happen or can function as warnings about the future, or even, \\"messages\\" about ourselves and what we can do to alter the \\"higher destiny\\" which is the part of fate we actually can manipulate.<br />     In the hi-tech, fast paced and materialistic modern world all this may sound like another book for \\"weirdos\\", but it can't be dismissed as others in its genre exactly because synchronicities are something mostly everyone notices at one point of life or another, and the more aware you are about them the more apparent they become.<BR>     Being a natural sceptic the first time i picked up this book  i abandoned it after only being 1/3 into it becuase i felt it wasn't compatible with my own personal system of beliefs and understanding. It was only after i started noticing some startling synchronicities myself that i read it (through this time) again , only to realise that there's way more to synchronicities than, well, meets not only the eye but any of our senses.<BR>     I tend to think that the \\"truth\\" (whatever that may be) is not only something one can \\"learn\\" but it's also something one can feel and i consider both processes equally important.<BR>    <BR>     The author divides synchronicities into 17 categories and studies them providing in the process numerous truly incredible examples about them. At certain parts of the book it's the examples themselves that steal the show and you may find yourself recognising situations that are in one way or the other familiar to you but you hadn't paid attention when they happened. Attention is of primary importance as you will find out if you go ahead and read it. Frank Joseph attempts to find what most of us would call a \\"rational explanation\\" about synchronicities. He's never dogmatic (to his credit) about his own thoughts and his book reads like a conversation with the reader making it one definite \\"cantputdowner\\".<BR>   In the end what he proposes is essentialy that the reader examines this his/herself and explain it in his/her terms. It doesnt actually matter how one decides to explain synchronicities he muses, what matters is that there is a different dimension of reality present for everyone waiting to be explored, discovered and deciphered.<BR>   Put this book in your bag of valuable tools.	2003-04-09

He emphasizes the fact that while the internet is basically the biggest storage of information we've invented so far, it doesnt possess artificial intelligence (yet?) and thus it is hopelessly still relying on humans to sort this information out, divide it into &quot;important&quot; and &quot;unimportnat&quot; information, and even then, it's furthermore relying on the person looking for the information who has to know what he/she's looking for and how to get it (evaluating the information for example)...<BR>    He points out the flaws as he tackles the weaknesses of the search engines which look for key words and not meaning and predicts that we're not exactly close to solving this critical problem.<br />   On probably the most interesting -and simoultaneously most controversial- chapter of the book, learning through online courses, Dreyfus argues that without personal involvement we might acquire the factual knowledge but not the skill since we are not physically &quot;there&quot; to interact with a teacher and to mimic what he/she does as far as the subject of learning is concerned, since, as he claims, this is one of the basics of learning.<BR>    He adds a rather strong argument on that, when he says that the fundamental way we &quot;understand&quot; reality is ba having a handle on it. He then goes on to conclude that the internet takes away exactly that: our connection to reality, and reasons that learning online compared to the traditional ways of learning is limited and inadequate, it inhibits proficiency.<br />    With a world rapidly moving on to a digital existence, to functioning through the internet, a digital concious as it may, Dreyfus warns of the dangers. Predictably, alienation and new dimensions of loneliness are central themes of those warnings. We can talk to 10s of people online from different parts of the world without having any relationship with them. The passion is not there he claims, and that is probably the one indisputable point of his book.<br />     Keeping in mind that the internet is still a relatively new medium, any conclusions we might hurry to make might be very flawed themselves. Dreyfus points this out himself when he reminds us of Plato (who seems to be a favorite of his) who 2.500 years ago warned the Athenians of the dangers of the written word. Yet, Dreyfus believes that the inetrnet is a more clear-czt case where we can see the dangers more clearly.<BR>    I disagree. We do not know how the internet will develop yet and to what direction. In Europe only a small fraction of the population actually uses it, other than to send or receive an email. This is far below the net's capabilities and it doesn't provide us with enough data about its influence on human societies yet. Most of Dreyfus's observations come undoubtedly from the american usage of the internet (which is pioneering in that sector) but as more and more cultures get involved with the medium we are bound to see the medium take on more changes and uses.<br />    When it comes to online learning i would have to agree with Dreyfus's opinions with one main objection: up until recently learning the traditional way, whether in universities or schools, was going unquestioned and uncriticized. But especially in the 90s voices started abounding , especially from educators, that even that form of learning contains disembodiment. The west alone is filled with people with degrees who carry data but do not carry meaning in their data either exactly what Dreyfus is &quot;accusing&quot; the internet and its online courses of doing. <BR>     Learning in a school might provide with the all important human contact but how much of it is meaningful contact and to who's interest is one big open question. <BR>    Schooling (universities included) distribute dogma and the process of learning in them is basically limited on absorbing the dogma proficiently. It would be a blatant lie to claim that this type of learning is &quot;better&quot; than the online courses. It would also be an interesting question and discussion what type of learning is then the most proficient one? Dreyfus doesn't touch that question, indeed he seems to believe with no restrictions that the learning he's involved in (in university) is &quot;ok&quot;..<BR>     I beg to differ.<BR>     All this, with objections and questions included, doesn't mean that &quot;On the internet&quot; is not reccomendable. It's in fact filled with interesting points and at worst it's food for thought. As i said above , alone the fact that it's a philosophical approach on the issue makes it intriguing enough.<BR>     <BR>    But we shouldn't be hasty. In 10-20 years time this book might seem terribly outdated and flawed. In fact, some might claim (and they might be right) that it already is...	2003-04-07

There are obvious reasons for this. Applying philosophy on warfare to name one. Applying knowledge of human nature to achieve your goals to name another.<br />  The fact that many people recommend this book on matters other than warfare is one more compliment to it.<br />  Sun Tzu uses a mix of &quot;know thy self&quot;-&quot;know your enemy&quot;-&quot;understand reality&quot; to put together his philosophical thesis on war. It's a very indicative reading of Chinese philosophy indeed, as it is based on meticulous observation. Most of the Asian philosophies are based on the principle of &quot;attention&quot; and this evident on Sun Tzu's book as well.<br />  The author goes into an array of detailed &quot;instructions&quot; which go beyond the surface and deal more with anticipation, with being ahead like one would in a chess game.<br />  Strategy, cunning, fooling the opponent, anticipating disadvantageous situations, seeking favorable conditions and trying to create them, are all major themes of the &quot;Art of war&quot;.<br />  It has been claimed that at certain points the book becomes a tough cookie to swallow mainly because of the difference in midset between Asians and westerners but it is a very rewarding book in the end. It does apply in everyday life especially when one considers the hardcore competitive societies that we have the misfortune of living in today. I doubt the author wanted his book to be thought of in that way but that's another story.<br />  Up there on the list of classic philosophy.	2003-03-13

Ah here's another book destined to disgust the orthodox thinkers of this world who insist everything is clear-cut out there. If you belong to that caste you need not bother with the book or this review. The rest do read on.<BR>   Basically, this book is the musical industry's equivalent of a \\"best of\\". While seasoned conspiracy theorists will tell you that there's definately more than 70 conspiracies that need listing this is not the aim of this book.<BR>    What it aims at is to serve you with a summary of the top conspiracy material circulating planet earth and poke you on to do the rest of your reading yourself (or should i say the rest of your thinking?).<BR>   What you get is a short summary for each of the 70 conspiracy theories listed here. They seem to be well researched too for anyone with a deeper reference to all these theories.<BR>   True, most of the stuff being \\"investigated\\" here belong to the really glorified conspiracy theories, and, it's very probable you've heard or read them somewhere before: aliens, area 51, mind control programs, JFK, machurian candidates, secret weapons to name but a few.<BR>   The writting is very entertaining especially since the authors don't omit to add their own touches of sarcastic scepticism to some of the most extreme theories they involve. <BR>   More addvanced students of conspiracy lore (if you want to call it that) will probably not be satisfied here as this book is nothing more than a very dense presemtation of the \\"facts\\".<BR>   But, if you are just starting to get into this kinda stuff this book is a cool start as it will smoothly and effectively introduce you to the trenchcoated world within your world.<BR>    And if some of the theories presented here seem a bit \\"too far out\\" for your tastes just remember that \\"nothing is really as it seems\\" whether you believe in conspiracy theories or not.<BR>   Reality is not monodimensional anyway, and neither is the level of reality that we humans can interfere with.<BR>Or are we humans to start with?

Certain reviewers have argued that \\"The Prince\\" lacks in modern relevance. While there is merit to this point one must also entertain these thoughts:<BR>-Machiavelli wrote this guidebook to serve the rulers of his time and not ours, but more importantly:<BR>-had he lived in our times his book would've been as accurate as it was for when he lived. This is obvious by the fact of how well he has grasped human nature.<br />    Indeed, \\"The Prince\\" is a handbook on how to rule a nation, a kingdom or a folk in easy steps. He asserts that a leader must understand basic human nature function in order to be a succesful leader. By \\"succesful\\" he doesn't (obviously) mean \\"good to the people\\" but that he doesnt lose his grip on power. \\"Unsuccesful\\" in machiavellian terms means merely to lose power due to ineefective leadership. And what would \\"innefective\\" then mean?<br />   Innefective, in that sense, would mean a leader who does not know how to implement fear but simoultaneously respect (a tight rope that one), a leader who isn't constantly watching his subordinates for suspicious behaviours and who doesnt take measures to keep them \\"satisfied\\" (jump from one rope onto another then), a leader who doesnt understand the pulse of the people he rules over thus putting himself in danger of being overthrown, a leader who doesn't grasp the basic techniques of manipulation of the people may those be through religion, education, or direct politics. <br />    Machiavelli's advice moves along those lines as he tries to aid the \\"Prince\\" in overcoming these difficulties (political counseling anyone?).<br />    This book has been termed \\"cynical\\" because it promotes ruthlessness, cunning, and manipulation. Well, anybody who doesnt understand that this is what politics are all about to begin with has a very shallow definition of cynicism. The \\"Prince\\" is fundamentally honest, and yes, while cynicism is basically honesty expressed in emphasis Macchiavelli is not a cynic, that's not his intention(s), he was just a very servile political advisor of his time and he was quite good at doing his job.<BR>  <BR>    Problem is, the world has always been full of Machiavellis especially when one looks at the ruling \\"elite\\". The interesting part? Most of them have not even read machiavelli by all probabilities. They wouldn't need to, since human nature becomes anyway corrupted by power, and when it does, it then automatically functions in \\"Machiavellian\\" frequencies.<BR>    That's precisely the logical fault that certain people make when they argue about the \\"relevance\\" of this book in modern times. The relevance is direct and self evident. It lies in the effect of power (and the means to keep it) and human nature as it becomes corrupted by it. If one reads the modern political handbooks available he will find that they all repeat fundamentally the same techniques. Yes they have adapted to current balances, but if you want to read the \\"Prince\\" and \\"enjoy\\" its straightforwardness then you have to use a little (just a little) imagination.	2003-03-11
US	47065451	R2TJOAF810IAT7	0881846503	39218973	Beyond the Occult	Books	5	6	6	N	N	What if it's not &quot;paranormal&quot; after all?	Colin Wilson investigates the world of the &quot;paranormal&quot; by adopting a scientific approach to the issue. For those that might off hand think this is not possible this book is highly recommended. The author begins by pointing out the overwhelming quantity of evidence on what is called paranormal and that includes telepathy, time travel, astral projection, spirits, poltergeist and in general anything that conventional science refuses stubbornly to deal with on the grounds that &quot;it can't happen&quot;.<br />    But, it does happen and it's been happening for 10s of centuries, indeed since the beginning of recorded history as we know it.<br />    The premise that our brain possesses hidden powers upon which some people &quot;stumble&quot; by accident while others practice on after they discoverthem  is dominant in the book. In that respect Wislon attributes normality to the paranormal, after all our brain is tremendously inexplored and the notion that anything we dont understand (or dont know about) is not happening is absurd and has caused embarrassment to mainstream scientists mainy times in the past.<br />    It should go without mentioning that such an undertaking as this book here should be approached by the reader with the utmost state of openmindedness. If there is anything to be discovered and understood about realities we dont seem to accept yet we must first consider them as a possibility to begin with. <br />    &quot;Beyond the occult&quot; is written (as are most C.Wilson books) with a very philosophical aspect to it without at any point being inaccessible or difficult. In fact, this book will engulf you no matter what your stance is on the subject alone on the charismatic way it is written, laid out in its contents and explored. Wilson succesfully binds &quot;conventinal reality&quot; with that of the paranormal without insulting the intelligence of those who tend to think on more &quot;down to earth&quot; terms. There is no issues being shoved down anyone's throat and the author's own scepticism and questioning is also involved as he has for years investigated this extremely interesting area.<BR>    <BR>If you want to start your reading on this area but feel spooked and don't know where to begin then this is definately your door into the other side. Approach without fear.	2003-03-01

The \\"sense\\" of things is of course there to begin with. By trying to \\"apply sense\\" to them, that is, to make our own sense of them we might be not seeing them for what they really are.<BR>    The Stranger is a person who is literally watching his own life unfold without taking any passionate or particular emotional interest in it. It is as if he is having a peculiar out of body experience without being in a trance.<BR>    Many of the people who've read this book find it absurd (as is evident by the reviews of it here in Amazon as well). That's because they do what i mentioned above, they try to apply their own sense to it, and that is the real absurdity.<BR>    Life is not one path and it's not monodimensional. The \\"logic\\" that one person applies might be sheer madness for the next and so on. Camous's hero is a person detached from his surroundings. He finds it hard to understand why some people think this or the other thing, he finds it equally hard to share emotions that qualify as \\"normal\\". He is comfortable in his own world of indifference and becomes uncomfortable when the worlds of others interfere with his. That's what he is or how he is.<BR>   <BR> When the Stranger becomes a murderer it really comes as no surprise really considering the process via which this happens. Anything could happen to him as he doesn't resist the flow of things, he avoids friction and paradoxically this avoidance of friction that he so intensely pursues leads him to direct confrontation with his environment because of his crime. And this crime is dealt with by the Stranger the same way he's dealt with everything else: he is a spectator of that too.<BR>    Camous uses the trial of the Stranger brilliantly. The trial is of course nothing more than a platform the author utilises to bring across a clearer image of the Stranger. And as the final curtain is about to fall the reader is subjected to a very controversial view of the world. Which is? It's just \\"let me be\\"...<BR>    <BR>    I think that the reason The Stranger maintains its charm and importance even today (which means that it still touches the pulse of the times) is exactly because our societies are increasingly becoming full of Strangers, full of Spectators, and those who deny it should be accused of hypocrisy. This is not accidental. And, exactly because it is NOT accidental this book remains as important as the day it was first published. Why are we like this? Why have we become what we've become? Is this really our potential? Indifference? Is this all?<BR>   <BR>     Existentialist rhetoric and questions some might say. True, but defining our existence is something most of us are not  good at. The questions might be old but they haven't been answered, not in the past 50 years, not in the past 20 centuries. The Stranger asks them too. He's not the only one.	2003-02-27

So what you might say..True, and that would be qualifying you as an outsider. However, the fact that people seem to not be intereseted in themselves, what they are, and what's their &quot;place&quot; in this world or this reality(ies) is interesting. Isnt't it?<br />  Wilson, in the &quot;Outsider&quot; lays out a study that asks many pivotal questions, questions that most people would label as existentialist. He defines the outsider as a person that &quot;sees too deep but can't help it&quot;, a person that instinctively feels he doesnt fit in, becomes troubled by that, and sets out on a personal journey of discovering himself and his position in everything else.<br />  To do this, Wilson studies the message many outsiders have &quot;transmitted&quot; throughout history, may they be philosophers, authors, dancers, painters, artists in general. He looks for parallels amongst them as he tries to interpret and define them, looks for common (but also for uncommon) points, but more importantly looks to detect what it is exactly that disatisfies them about the world they find themselves in.<br />  And he does an extraordinary job at achieving his mission (defining the Outsider is a mission for those familiar with Wilson's works) while inducing provoking thoughts to the reader whether he's an outsider or not.<br />  He also explores the methods of the outsiders he studies. In the end they all emerge as an official club and this is more startling than it might sound. It's the &quot;commonness&quot; among outsiders that's interesting in my opinion.<br />  But, possibly the biggest issue is why does society keep producing Outsiders? Does that mean that as long as Outsiders keep being produced something is &quot;wrong? It more than certainly does.<br />  Any outsiders who will pick up this book to read will not be troubled by the fact that they might be unfamiliar with many artists Wilson studies. In fact, they'll wind up being inspired to study them also. On the other hand, any non-outsiders picking up this book might find themselves frustrated after the first 20-30 pages. And how will you know if you're an outsider or not to begin with? No worries. If you are you more than likely know it already. If you're not sure here's a tremendous and very inspirational book to help you find out.

It is a paradox though that even though Wilson has written very many illuminating books since then he still remains an &quot;underground author&quot;..Why`Well, i suppose that may have to do with the fact that he's an outsider himself, who, ultimately, will be read by (primarily) outsiders?<br />  Discover that you are not alone.n fact, they'll wind up being inspired to study them also.

The author (J.Fest) plunges into a psycho-social analysis of the Nazi elite and attempts (succesufully) to shed some light on the people who moved the strings of Nazism in Germany.<br />  Admittedly, the author's heavy writting style will turn off a certain group of viewers. While his intentions on decoding the personas that played key roles of Nazism are honest and straightforward, the atmosphere of the book is rather characterised by abusing descriptions and verbal exagerations.<br />  Short biographies and psychological profiles are on offer here: Hitler, Goering, Hoess, Himmler, Hess, Ribbentrop, to name but a few.<br />  However, you'd be mistaken (in my view anyway) to assume that this book will help you understand what brought this fascistic movement to power. Before even deciding whether you should read this or not, start by reading \\"The rise and fall of the third Reich\\" or other books pertaining on fascism and the masses. What is absent here are the german people themselves. Fascism does not rise because of a few psychotic personalities , and, as was proven in Germany's example, it very often complicits the people themselves to grab the power mechanisms.<br />  But, if you are interested in blitz-biographies, and short \\"explanations\\" then the \\"Face of the third reich\\" will be a good choice. Then again, when it comes to the major players of Nazism there are far better individual biographies and character accounts out there (one of them by the author himself on Hitler).	2003-02-08
US	47065451	R32G70VHLWQAXD	0140171347	394420508	First Day On The Somme 1 July 1916 (Penguin History)	Books	4	13	13	N	N	A thorough account of one day's deaths	The battle of the Somme has gained such notoriety for what it has \\"managed\\" to stand for: thousands of corpses littered one on top the other in a huge battlefield while thousands of men are charging over them while machine gun fire is mowing them down systematically and shelling is tearing them furthermore to pieces.<BR>    Being possibly the last battle in modern history where \\"old tactics\\" were used against modern werfare, the battle of the Somme has been a very brutal antiwar message. A message not learned of course. <BR>    The British army suffered its doomiest 3 days in its history as it sent waves of 1000's of men to charge withoout any cover against trenches defended by machine guns. The results might seem to you (even if you dont know the story) predictable, but for the British generals of the time things were apparently not as clear.<BR>   While the author makes his approach primarily from the British point of view (for the respective German view try the classic \\"All quiet in the  the Western Front) he still manages to capture the overall atmosphere of that surreal bloodbath. He does so by providing countless first hand accounts by the people who -miraculously- survived. These accounts bring forth a picture of trully hard to imagine dimensions. One of unparallel death toll, carnage, pointlessness, human idiocy, vanity, and in short a picture only humans in this world are capable of \\"painting\\".<BR>    As over 60.000 British soldiers  literally became \\"food for the cannons\\" (a german euphemism) in less than a day, they turned an otherwise dull landscape in France into a place of remembrance and somber thought. And, contemplation for future generations one would think. This would of course presuppose that future generations are aware of such dark pages in history which i very much doubt.<BR>   The author walks a tight rope as he tries to first give you a historical overview of what had happened up to that point of the war, what the balances were (sociologically) and he moves on to the logistics and military analysis of the war without tiring the reader as he becomes more concerned with the human aspect of the people who were actually there. Those that lived and more importantly those that died.<BR>    He doesnt overpush his case, he hardly needs to, as you will also find out. Some of what he describes is so hard to stomach that there is obviously no need to overstate it in order to drive the point home. The more you read on the more you acquire the reality that death isnt notable only when it's brutal. In the end what makes war one of the most pointless human \\"expressions\\" is that the termination of life always comes down to the ancient conflict between the question \\"why\\" and the reasons for war themselves. The answers should be obvious. Emphasis on the \\"should\\"..<BR>    Overall,this book is one of the very best accounts on the battle of the Somme. Keeping in mind the time this book was written it has extra value as it contributed in setting new standards for writting history. It lets the people themselves narrate compared to the \\"old school\\" history books where an author would go on a monolithic account that would tire and illuminate only marginally.<BR>   Stunning...	2003-02-08

Books	5	1	8	N	N	Nightmares and echoing laughter	You gotta be thankful for Michael Moore's hardcore humor. Were it not for that then the contents of this book would emerge for what they really are: the american nightmare.<BR>    There is possibly no other \\"sane\\" method left on how to look on the current situation on the U.S other than dress it up in heavy-duty wit. The facts that Moore lays out in \\"Stupid white men..\\" are simply too scary. <BR>    Stolen and rigged elections? Check. A president who never got elected with an extreme anti-people right wing agenda? Check. The enviromental and financial breakdown of a huge country while its own people are disinformed and misled about it? Yep, in the book too. The ongoing, often in-yer-face racism in america? Ya betcha, in here too. The continuing neglect of urgent social problems (education, infrastructure, welfare) because of the disanalogical money-pumping into the arms and military industry? Uh-huh, check. The really serious problem of America lacking a second party? Yessir, Moore does a stunning job brining this onto the surface. The Democrats are not opposition he claims and hits us with indisputable arguments. A society that is actually a boiling pot ready to explode with unpredictable results? Inevitable conclusion.<BR>   You have to wonder why the establishment is not bothered by books like this one. Or why the Moores of America aren't considered a threat by the elite. Some will say \\"well, thats the triumph of free speech\\". Hmm, i beg to differ on that one. That's the triumph of a well-oiled brainwashing mashine. You would think (and hope) that books like this have a tremendous impact, that they have the potential to bring change, to make people think, or at the very least to start waking people up. Call me a pessimist but i doubt it will happen.<BR>    Point remains that it is hard to disagree with what mr. Moore professes here. After all it is not mere \\"opinions\\" he lays before us. It is facts, and as you might or might not know facts are facts. It's also optimistic (as other reviewers pointed out too) that Moore serves as en example on why faith on the american people isn't entirely lost. It's close to that but not entirely.<BR>    Lastly, it's not the first time that facts like these have been detailed and recorded in a book. Chomsky comes to mind. Others, many others, many Americans in fact too. The big difference between their and Moore's effort is accessibility. The average reader (now, thats a term that's always troubled me) wont have to sift through rhetoric and terms he doesnt understand. Moore's language reminds me often of that of Bill Hicks. To the point, cynical, well substanstiated and sarcastic as it gets.<BR>    Truly overwhelming.	2003-01-31
US	47065451	RWU9OULQ4PQXV	034544034X	920633675	Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief	Books	2	13	22	N	N	Why wont scientists who are actually theologists go away?	This has to be one of the most two-faced books I've ever read.<BR>   I picked it up after a recommendation from a friend albeit in a half-hearted spirit. I was then surprised to find that its first chapters were intriguing and had an interesting theory/proposition to make.<BR>   In summary, the neurologists who wrote the book propose that our brain is biologically inclined to \\"discover\\" god. This they conclude after conducting brainscanning experiments with meditating Buddhist monks and others (under meditation). The book, in its initial chapters, does a very good job introducing brain function to novices, and more importantly, introduces also the notion that since our brain needs to interpret everything it experiences (conciouncly or subconciounsly) it uses the creation of myth to explain what it otherwise couldn't interpret through reason and logic.<BR>     At that point you'd think \\"hey, this is moving along better than i expected actually\\". Nah. That was just the bait. Because, while this theory is actually not an unreasonable premise the wild and inane conclusions \\"drawn\\" from it ultimately turn the book into a joke.<BR>    You see,  the fact that people use myth to explain what is otherwise inconceivable to them may account for a lot. Religion included. Voices in head included. Santa Claus incuded. After all, we live in societies where people are not exactly brought up on logic and reasoning but rather on dogma. Dogma, by definition, leaves a lot to be explained. People who think dogmatically will resort to myth when their brain finds no other way to explain things. Subsequently they might \\"discover\\" god.<BR>    Yes, but hold on tell us the authors here. Because, they say, we noticed in our experiments that what mystics experience in their deepest transcedences is real since it can actually be scientifically observed, inotherwords, we confirmed that yes, they do \\"experience\\" something \\"special\\" and miraculously they universally agree (in one form or another) that this \\"special\\" experience is god. Hmmm. But how about the millions of atheists who also medidate and who have no reports of god to offer? This is a \\"little\\" fact that is very loudly omitted in the book.<BR>   Or, for the same matter, and using the very discoveries of these \\"scientists\\", why is it that what the mystics experience is not mere myth creation since they themselves- more often than not- say that they cant actually put in words what they experience? <BR>    This type of \\"reasoning\\" (I'm abusing the word on purpose) creates more questions than it could possibly ever answer.<BR>     It follows the line of theist apologists who try to incorporate pseudoscience to justify their beliefs (myths) and hope noone will notice. Well, nice try, you gotta give them that much..<BR>     The concluding 3-4 chapters of the book are a spectacular display of braindead tripe. That's fascinating for a book that actually concerns itself with a functioning brain. Riddled with countless \\"maybe\\"s and endless \\"we-are-not-sure-but-it-could-be\\" type of \\"scientific\\" arguments the last chapters are a lesson in alienating the reasoning reader. But that's actually unfair to say. The reasoning reader isnt within the targets of such books.<BR>     While finishing this totally sorry excuse of a book for science i was thinking how that felt. It felt like going to a party , having initially a good time, but ending up hugging the toilet bowl the rest of the night.<BR>    Look for serious information on the subject elsewhere folks.<BR>    In fact, you really want to discover why god wont go away? Start by looking around and noticing where we are brought up. In a society with a very strong , and indeed very old, element of religion, it's only natural that \\"mystics\\" as well as anyone might fall  for explaining things through \\"god\\" if all else fails him/her.. The problem is that \\"all else\\" isnt usually offered, because, duh, the dominant religious element wouldnt (obviously) want it that way.<BR>    For those seriously interested in serious and above all solid logic on the issue of god existing or not i recommend the superb \\"Atheism: the case against god\\".	2003-01-25

This, after all, is the greatest of the Socratean principles.<BR>     Dont expect from this review, or from any review, or from anybody, to \\"push\\" you to read books like the \\"Wars of Gods...\\".Consider it your...obligation to your mind to be allowed to be challenged by books like this. This is my suggestion/proposition.<BR>    Now to the book itself: what you get here is first of all a rather brief recapitulation of what Sitchin has already proposed in the first 2 books of the \\"chronicles\\". Then, he develops his incredible theory(?) further by stating the following:<BR>Internal rivalries amongst the aliens that had inhabited this planet 100s of millenia ago (these were the \\"gods\\") led to brutal and merciless wars for supremacy. Humans -who for the uninitiated, were the result of genetic cloning of these aliens- were eventually also entered into the picture to either fight the wars for their \\"gods\\" or in many instances to fight alongside them.<BR>     While Sitchin is narrating all this he inevitably comes upon ancient architectural mysteries like the pyramids and he offers a stunning theory for their purpose: the pyramids were space centers equipped with high technology and were vital for the control of space activity above this planet. They became main targets in certain wars between \\"gods and men\\" and much of what they contained was either destroyed or looted.<BR>    As any serious professional or amateur pyramid researcher knows, the mainstream explanations offered about how they were built and why are laughable. Sitchin's theory on them makes sense  if, of course, you come to accept his overall picture. But I'll get to that a bit further on.<BR>    Thisbook is concluded in a booming close-out as the author professes that the space facilities in the Sinai peninsula were destroyed in an ancient nuclear war and that there are deep geographical \\"scars\\" to attest to this, visible even today!<BR>    This is a very strict summary of what you will encounter in the \\"Wars of gods and men\\". There are other equally engaging issues that Sitchin tackles here but the aforementioned ones are of higher significance.<BR>    It goes without saying that you should actually read Sitchin in the chronological and logical order of his books. Start from the fascinating \\"Twelfth planet\\" first before you venture onto this book here.<BR>    Sitchin, as those who have read him, know, is no great writer. As an author he is actually tiring, not that he can help it much considering the task he lays to himself, but he obviously lacks the talent for narration. He compensates for that by being a tremendous researcher and a fearless mind. You can be great at researching but if your mind is too dogmatic it wont allow you to arrive at the right conclusions anyway. Sitchin is a totally daring mind though. I'm not sure that any researcher with his knowledge and talent would dare go against what is considered sacred dogma about our species: that we originate from apes (by the way: so how come some apes developed into humans and some didnt? and what keeps the rest of the apes all these millenia from also developing into humans???).<BR>     Anyhow, critics will say that it's extremely difficult to verify Sitchin's translations as one would first have to learn Avyssynian and Sumerian. Well, yes, one would, but you see, the problem is that the people who have offered you the theories you learned about the ancient world at school had not learned those languages. Yet you accept their theories without much questioning. How come? Wouldn't it be absolutely essential to be able to read the scripts in the original before you even attempt any theorising?<BR>    This is a tremendous idea that this author offers and is in my opinion recquired reading considering the massive bulk of unanswered questions concerning where we come from , what we are, and what our past is. The most serious reason i can provide you with for reading this is out of respect to your very own mind. Keep it open.	2003-01-18

Yes, the social critique cuts deep as it does in other books the author has written too. Yes he delivers some hard hits on religion, the media, and societal hypocrisy, and yes you would have to really think hard to come up with many modern authors who are as merciless when they put us all under their microscope as he is. Yes the prose is &quot;different&quot; than what you'd mostly find out there. Yes the dripping sarcasm is present (as it was in Fight Club), yes the subtle irony is there too, yes the unique and hardcore sense of humor isnt absent either.<BR>    So why does this not work then? Well, for starters because the story is messy. Or because there is no character that really engages you in it like there was in...Fight Club. How many times have i mentioned the author's previous novel already? You get the point.<BR>   I do have the annoying suspicion that people feel either obliged to see this book in an overpositive view exactly because of its predecessor and simoultaneously afraid to be honest about how much they really liked it (or disliked it) for the same reason.<BR>   Would i reccomend &quot;Survivor&quot;? No, but I'd rather tell anyone to start from where the real juice is (which  would, err, be Fight Club) and wait a while till the author redelivers the results of his massive and powerful potential.<BR>    I wont bother reviewing the story since many other reviewers have already done it but i'll repeat my warning: this book here is dodgy, folks. I forced myself through it and i was puzzled because i (obviously) was expecting something way, way, better.<BR>    All this doest mean i'm giving up on the author, of course not. I'm just a bit dissapointed by this particular effort.	2003-01-09

Drugs, experimenting with sexuality, learning about emotions, trying to interpret, trying to define the everyday reality he's into.<BR>   Utterly convincing, the story feels like it was written by a teenager at his teenage years (kudos to the author then ). <BR>    I personally caught myself reminiscing most of the time as i went through the sometimes simplistic questions that Charlie poses. That speaks volumes because caught reminiscing while reading a story like that is a good sign. It means the story is \\"accurate\\" , as accurate a novel like that can be since we all experience many different types of reality.<BR>    \\"The perks of being a wallflower\\" is also full of many humorous moments the kind of \\"funniness\\" that emerges when you are learning about life and commit yourself to mistakes or situations that might seem to you as super tragic or critical but they are just part of the process of growing up and later on you reinstate them for what they really are.<BR>    One of the few novels of that kind that explore homosexuality in a plain natural manner \\"The perks...\\" is a winner there too.<BR>   Recommended reading not only for those that want to compare notes of their past (or even present) but especially for those bringing upkids. It's one thing to have been there and another to remember how it really feels like going through it.<BR>    And when it comes to describing the \\"feeling\\" of it all, the helplessness and the agony or the angst of teenagehood \\"The perks...\\" is a wonderful contribution.	2003-01-02

Then again, the average reader will not read this book so i guess it's all good in the end.<BR>    However, for those that want to (re)discover situationism as a movemement there are better books out there.<BR>    This is a collection of essays from various figures explaining or criticising -or both- the birth and decline of situationism in the 60s. Many of the contributors assume that the reader already has some knowledge or familiarity with  the topic or is even well acquainted with it so they take it from there making certain parts of the book hard to comprehend.<BR>   But if your patience prevails you will be awarded:<BR>-You will be informed about the main ideas and concepts behind the \\"S.I's\\" (Situationists International). Mainly a movement which aimed to be a creative attack against the society of the spectacle and which succeeded for a certain period while finding its own demise mainly due to its eliticism.<BR>-A couple of specific essays, namely, those that deal with music and the arts stand out as extraordinary and very important critiques on music and the arts in general. The part in particular about punk and the Sex Pistols happens to be the sharpest and possibly most original (and dead-on the spot)criticism  i've read anywhere and i have read literally 1000s of articles and tens of books on music because of my profession.<BR>- Other gems (for the uninitiated) include \\"psychogeography\\" which involves remapping a city according to the effect a city's buildings, streets, or quarters have on someone.<BR>    All in all not always an easy reading (ok, i'm understating here) but a highly interesting one nevertheless.<BR>    But if you want to know situationism then do not start from here.

A serial killer, the witty &quot;cool&quot;-and-against-the-system detective who gets dragged out of retirement to catch the beast that terrorises the city, the murders that keep happening until Sherlock gets the right clues, and you yawning your way through this horror of a book.<BR>    Actually the only thing intimidating about this novel is exactly that: how horrible it is. The writting is at best uninspired and lacks any positive contribution to the genre, but worst of all the characters are such that if they existed in real life you would do your best humanly possible not to meet them unless you think that boredom is a virtue.<BR>    I read somewhere that this book even won an award in the UK! They must be kidding us! <BR>    I found myself totally not caring about the plot of the story already 50 pages in the book and the only reason i kept reading (until i finally gave up a full 150 pages before the end) was that i thought: a. there's an incredible twist coming up here that will save this joke of a story and b. i wanted to see how bad the book can actually get.<BR>   But i didnt even get the vicious satisfaction a masochist would seek by reading the worst possible book he could lay his hands on. Because, you see, if it was THAT bad i might've at least finished it. But it's not. It's flat, so flat, that it sets a standard.

US	47065451	R1EFUM3ANVWOJV	0451524934	337991686	1984 (Signet Classics)	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Is your mind corrected beyond repair?	Possibly the worst thing to say about this overwhelming book is that it is...science fiction. It is promoted as such in the schools where the kids \\"have\\" to read it because it is a \\"classic\\" (we all know what that means, and if you dont then consider how many books you remember from that time and consider what effect they would have on you had you read them 10 or 15 years later).<br />  Orwell constructs and describes a nightmarish totalitarian dictatorship where the system controls literally everything. And that includes your thoughts. If you deviate you will be \\"corrected\\".<br />  It's a society where the past has been wiped out because the system controls all forms of information. It is impossible to know what has happened before and one is forced to accept the constant lies from the government at face value while going through intense brainwashing of other forms as well.<br />  Winston (the main character) is a man who still has traces of the past in his brain, in other words he commits the ultimate crime (thoughtcrime) as he questions the official version of things. As he desperately looks for signs from others hoping that they feel the same way he enters an underground conspiracy that aims to overthrow Big Brother (the invisible but everpresent power that represents a faceless system). And just as a flame of hope lights up inside him  the nightmare transforms into an endless journey to hell.<br />  There is no point of giving away the plot because it happens to be one of great twists as Winston finds out in the most scary way imaginable the sheer controlling power that Big Brother enjoys over everyone.<br />  There are so many myths about 1984. One is that the book implies the horrors of communism (stalinism to be exact). While it is true that Orwell was inspired by the \\"feats\\" of Big Daddy (that would be Joseph Stalin) to write his book he was equally inspired by the unspeakable crimes of the Nazi dictatorship in Germany as well. Orwell does not imply any onespecific form of dictatorship but he simply tries to see forward, he tries to warn and predict the forms that the dictatorships of the future will have and he puts no political color on it. The dictatorship he describes could happen in a society near you, no matter where you live and no matter how safe you think your \\"democracy\\" might seem to you.<br />  Allthough (and especially) the last part of the book is the most intimidating and overbearing one, i found that what actually scared me the most was how accurate the author is in what he sees for the future. Remember he wrote this way over half a century ago. And what does he see?<br />  He foresees thought control. Check. In case you think you arent thought-controlled then the system is functioning perfectly thank you. He foresees the manipulation of history in order to make the system more powerful. Check again. It used to happen in a smaller degree now it happens in a scientific degree. Take for example the \\"People's history of the United States\\" by Howard Zinn, read it, and compare what you read with what you \\"learned\\" in school, and you will see my point. And that's just one of the 1000s of examples that could be brought up.<br />  He foresees a a dictatorship where people do not realise they live in a dictatorship (and the few who do are \\"put away\\"). Well, guess what, check again. Regardless of where you live chances are you do not realise how the system controls you, and not only that, but chances are again, you call this a democracy because that is what you are told (brainwashed) to call it.<br />  And on and on and on..All this is just paving the way for the Orwellian nightmare.<br />  Some have said that life itself proved that Orwell was just a hardcore pessimist as the \\"future\\" didnt prove to be that horrible. Wrong. The genius of George Orwell has actually seen the process through which what he describes WILL happen. It is in fact happening right now. There are many who see it and sense it but many times more who dont.<br />  There is no point to be silly and promote this stunning future-diagnosis of a book as a \\"classic\\" or to suggest to you that you \\"must\\" read it or all that.<br />  Things are very simple. If you care about yourself before all else then do read it. If there is still hope for you then this book will change you. If this book has no effect on you then you do not understand the problem to begin with. But that's a good thing. Because in that case you will never have to see some future \\"Room 101\\". What is \\"Room 101\\"? It's a place in Orwell's \\"future nightmare\\" that very few have been in but everybody knows that that's where you are corrected from bad thoughts.<br />  But go on. Treat yourself to some bad thoughts. Such rooms dont exist anyway.	2002-12-19

Suddenly he gets a sudden visit from his gone-for-years brother (Palmer). Palmer informs him that he's been a member of the notorious Illuminati and that they are ready to launch a plan that will throw the world in a global dictatorship while 100s of 1000s will die. Palmer then reveals to Chad that he's now an Illuminati foe and wants to foil the plan and for that he wants Chad to assasinate an Illuminati master so the evil plan can be spoiled.<BR>    Chad hears this out , buys it hands down, (oh, Palmer convinces him cuzz he predicts the assasination of the president), and then they go ahead to assasinate the masters of the infamous Illumicrew. Then the story goes on where poor Chad finds out his wife has been assasinated by the Illumis and that this was also part of the plan, and eventually, also finds out that his brother has tricked him into this as he wants to take over the leadership. <BR>   Now, why a supposed Illuminati would use poor ole Chad for his plan when he's got all this incredible power is anybody's guess. The story is as hilarious as that, sadly...Or why the supposedly ultra-powerful Illuminati masters would have such poor protection as they are shown to have in the book is also quite a joke.<BR>    Firstly, if this book intends to hook the conspiracy freaks then this will be exactly the crowd that will find \\"Paranoia\\" totally ridiculous. Riddled with cliches and totally naive dialogue the book is for the most part a torture to read. Only when the author goes on small sprees where he reveals his thoughts about the various conspiracies that may have gone on in history does the book become interesting. <BR>   But then, ifyou want to be informed about conspiracy lore and reality then why start with this sorry effort? Prefer some other of the dozens of books about the subject out there.<BR>    Making a cheap, hardly believable story where you do a \\"best-of-conspiracies\\" mix is hardly worth reading if you are a serious \\"truth seeker\\". It doesnt even have any entertainment value as there is zero fun in going through it.<BR>    A book best ignored.	2002-12-09

Fast food eating is a major characteristic of western \\"civilisation\\" , and yes, maybe in America it's way more embued into the \\"culture\\" but being a European i know that it's  thriving here as well.<BR>    I read the book, and found out that there is feces in the burgers we eat, in the burgers that i used to eat too. Was that the most shocking revelation then? Not even close.<BR>    What angered me the most, is that an industry like the fast food industry which has made a science of tricking the customer into thinking this is \\"real\\" flavor in their fries (no it's not, all their flavors are artificial) or their burgers and shakes, an industry that is known for their outrageous exploitation of their workers to the point that any bad-paid job is now worldwide known as a \\"Mcjob\\", an industry like the fast food industry that destroys the rain forests to make grazing fields for cows so that they can go on making feces-ladden burgers also gets subsidies from the government(s) so they can continue their godly mission of making -even- more profits.<BR>   You dont emerge much happier after having read Schlosser's book. You emerge angry, very angry.<BR>    The author gives you all the information you'll ever need on how corporations like the ones that run fast foods are responsible for the shockingly low standard for our lives. <BR>    I have stopped eating at fast foods for over two years now, not because i think that's the only aspect of my health that is endagered by corporations but because i am trying in every way possible not to give them any money. After all, this is the only language they truly understand since their bible is one with a dollar sign on the cover.<BR>    One of the really valuable contributions of the book is that it offers solutions. Before you can avoid a danger you have to identify that danger. \\"Fast food nation\\" does that meticulously.<BR>    And that danger is -down at the root of it- corporational greed and consumer disinformation and/or apathy. We are not powerless is the real message here. They exist because we help them exist by being their customers. They underpay our teenagers and in many cases many of us regardless of age because we let them do it. They destroy our forests because we let our governments allow them to do it. They let and cause hunderds of brutal accidents happen at their slaughterhouses because we allow them to do it (possibly one of the most gut-turning chapters of the book).And they put feces in our food because in the end they dont expect us to react even to that.<BR>    \\"Fast book nation\\" manages to shock most people that read it. It did much better for me. It reenforced my conviction to stop feeling like an ant before the industry's efforts to exploit me as a consumer and as a worker. <BR>    Beware of those golden archs indeed. And spread the word about the book. Information is what we need.	2002-12-01

What would remain of any nation's \\"heroes\\" if history were to be told from the side of the victims and not from the side of \\"forefather\\" politicians , militants or conquerors? Not much..Maybe a bloodstained flag and an impressive load of shame...<br />    In this tremendous (and at times downright shocking) book by Howard Zinn you will discover several shameful (to say the very least) aspects of american history that you certainly were not taught in school.<BR>   Zinn does a thorough job to documentarise the facts from the side of those that have not been allowed to form the official version of history of the U.S as we know it: blacks, Indians, the invaded and the bombed around the globe, as well as the American citizens themselves , especially those that died or were imprisoned and largely forgotten in their struggle to shape the future of America.<BR>   <BR>    I must admit that this book left me thinking how clueless i have been about certain facts even though i consider myself a studier of alternative sources of history. I did not know the gruesome extend of the Indian race by us whites. I did not know it numbered into several millions of people, and i did not know the full extend of their humiliation and degradation. Hollywood westerns have done a good job in distorting (for once more) the truth..<BR>    Nor did i know the full story of racism in America and the forms it took way back when slaves (official slaves, mind you) still existed. I was left lingering between the drama and tragedy of these two peoples, the blacks and the Indians, but i was also left with an adequate explanation about the racial tensions and the very fragile social web in America today.<BR>    <BR>     What impressed me the most was that i had almost no idea about the political struggles of the American working class that date back almost 200 years and of which there is hardly a parallel to find even in Europe. It's one thing to know mere \\"data\\" such as that the \\"1st of May\\" originates in the strikes of Chicago and another to find out that socialism , anarchism and other political ideologies thrived in the U.S or that very intense and brutal battles between the financial establishment and  the workers took place in America over an extended period of time. The history of the -literally- 1000s of strikes and the countless dead or imprisoned from the unions was revealing to put it mildly.<BR>   Women are a big part of american history forgtten/or covered up, of course. Their side of the story is largely revealed here and adequately exposed as well. The centuries long exploitation and social discrimination and their creative and brave efforts to overturn it.<BR>     When it came to America's global imperialism i fared better as that part of history is better documented (especially) in international sources, but still, the invasions of Indochina, or Cuba, the brutal conduction of war in Vietnam or the inhuman decision to bomb Cambodia just to \\"display power to China\\" as well as the construction of the big myth of the threat posed by the Soviet Union (that served as an excuse to maintain the \\"arms race\\") were uncovered in a new way to me.<br />     It's really a vain effort to try and list the issues Howard Zinn deals with in his endeavour. There are many and they are complex. Some readers complain about \\"scholar issues\\" or about the writting style of the author. I personally found no problem with either of these . The author is honest and you can almost feel his effort to keep his tone under control especially when you consider what he has to write about (read the book and you will understand what i mean)..<BR>    I, in fact, thought that what comes forward is that Zinn writes as what some people would describe as a \\"patriot\\" allthough i dont know if the author intends it that way...<BR>   All in all, this is easily one of the best books I've ever read simply because it provided me with 100s of answers to matters where my views or my questions were remaining unclarified for too long.<BR>    Monumental.	2002-11-27

Three editors go on a mental trek to rediscover and revise the history of the world based on the writtings of people who could be considered credible and others that could have zero credibility at all. As they do, they unravel a massive web of conspiracies orchestrated from the depths of history to the present day by innumerous secret societies and underground groups poised to control the world and take over. These \\"societies\\" often clashing amongst themselves and often figments of imagination of others (but how can we really know) take the three  protagonists around the world as they search for more and more data to put together their story. And the more data that piles in the more the truth becomes a blur.<BR>    As the story spins, they, and we too, do not know which of their \\"facts\\" are real and which aren't. For some the devices are not available to test their authenticity, and for others, the suspicion lingers that strategically placed false information has been laid in their path to throw them off track.<BR>   But the worst element for the three investigators is the very real possibility that some of the \\"facts\\" could be mere inventions of their own brains! Thus, they constantly need to investigate themselves too to keep their story in check. But how easy, or rather, how feasible is that?<BR>    \\"Foucault's pendulum\\" is a book that spans over 650 pages, and a story that many people have found exhausting or even pointless. But if you had to attempt yourself to write a story with the outcome and the \\"moral\\" of this one then it would be very probable that you'd need a build-up as long and as \\"exhausting\\" as Ubmerto Eco here does.<BR>    Allthough i could agree with some that this incredible novel is at times \\"exhausting\\", i totally understand the need for its structure and length.<BR>   Eco deals with more than just a story here. The way we perceive reality and how we are sometimes led to perceive it is a topic that bears no borders. Which, probably explains why100s of books have been written on the subject.<BR>   Is there a conspiracy by secret societies to control the world? Hmm, who are you to answer, and, if there is, why do you imagine that these \\"societies\\" would let you know? You are enlightened? Says who? And what if it's all in your brain? If it is indeed \\"all in your brain\\" how would you be able to know? <BR>   How much \\"knowledge\\" and how many \\"facts\\" rest in your cerebrum about which you cannot trace the track by which they got there? How much of the \\"history\\" you know and have been taught can you actually prove for yourself?<BR>   And even if you set out to prove it for yourself, could you?<BR>   How easy is it really to separate truth from lie? I say it's not that easy. And if it's not that easy, then, wouldnt those who hold power and know this too, try to use this little fact to their advantage?<BR>   Wouldn't they try to use that as a device to manipulate, brainwash, mislead and misguide, whole peoples for their dark goals? Common sense would dictate that yes, but then, if common sense is really \\"common\\" why is it so uncommon to begin with?<BR>   Hmm..<BR>    To cut a long story short, this is a tremendous book. Yes it demands your dedication, but for good reason. Yes, it might not be for everyone (and judging from other reviews i read) it obviously isn't but, so what? Good things are by definition not for everyone, especially in days like these where intraterrestrial intelligence is becoming more rare than the white eagle.<BR>   This incredible rollercoaster of a book takes you deep back with a time machine, thrusts you back...forward, plays with your mind, plays with its own mind, and climaxes in its last 100 pages to the question troubling us all:<BR>     what is real?<BR>   While you might attempt to think about it, excuse me while i go get paranoid.<BR>    Umberto Eco is without a doubt one of the sharpest thinkers of our time.

This book represents to me an interesting, yes, but nevertheless old trick: state an opinion that mostly everyone agrees on ( in this case \\"we are moving fast towards global economic and social doom\\") dress it up with platitudes and foggy \\"explanations\\" and finish off by actually advocating that the movers and shakers of the system aren't responsible for any of it themselves..<br />  So who's responsible for the economic and social doom or the \\"coming anarchy\\"?<br />  Well that's where it gets even more interesting. The author points out to us the guilty ones by actually telling us who is not guilty. That would be for example Henry Kissinger for whom Kaplan dedicates more than a whole chapter praising his efforts to maintain a balance in this mad, mad world we're living in..<br />  But then again, Kaplan admits that Kissinger was one of the pivotal decision makers for the brutal bombings in Cambodia with 1000s of innocent civilians dead. The reason according to the book? It was nothing more than an expression of power to China (!!!)..And the Vietnam war? Oh that was also \\"needed\\" because the region had to be \\"stabilised\\"..<br />  Just when it starts becoming obvious that the author is an apologist for some of the darker eras of the past century you come upon the more intriguing parts. Why cant the world be saved?<br />  That, according to the author, is because aside of the west vast parts of the rest of the world and in particular Africa and -secondarily??- Asia are \\"not ready for democracy\\"! Why? Because their populaces are illiterate and because they have a history of political violence and instability..See, it all is far too simple and if politics or, more importantly, history is not your forte it might even sound logical too.<br />  It is strikingly obvious though that stating a result alone doesn't justify an explanation if you dont state the process that led to that result. If, for instance, you say that criminality rates are sky rocketing and then you advocate harsh measures for criminals without bothering to explain the sociological basis for such a development (i.e high unemployment, the erosion of the social bonds etc) you are stating half truths.<br />  African societies have not, by some magical and mysterious reason, remained \\"uneducated\\" because they somehow tend towards disorder and chaos. Same goes for Asian societies as well. Kaplan mentions not a single word about the the ongoing and very old in fact brutal exploitation of african and asian societies by the west. Exactly how were these societies supposed to advance under the centuries-old colonial boot of Europe and later on by multinational companies? Minor detail according to the \\"Coming anarchy\\"..<br />  What Kaplan professes is that these societies are not only not ready for democracy but they actually need brutal regimes in order to keep anarchy in check!! Hmm, i hadn't, for one, thought of that, i must admit.<br />  And besides, the author goes on, dictatorships arent by definition \\"bad\\". They have their purpose when the right timing is involved...<br />  Kaplan ends up being an apologist for backing up dictatorships then (it's not that he denies it but he sees the \\"necessity\\" of it) and an apologist for those that were central figures behind such policies (Kissinger and Nixon for example and -wow- Metternich). Further on he blames the victims, the \\"third world\\" societies, for the coming anarchy and concludes that \\"we\\" in the west are doing relatively ok but that the world isnt only made up of \\"us\\" and thus \\"we\\" have no total control over what is going to happen.<br />  In reality noone of course has any \\"control\\" of what is going to happen, not in terms of fate, but it would be anyway over the top arrogant to consider us as a species \\"in control\\" of things to begin with.<br />  But when it comes to sociological developments, to matters like war and peace (war can be good claims the author because without war there cant be any peace, a cold war motto in this case) one has to acknowledge every single piece of the puzzle and Kaplan very obviously does not care to do that. Judging from his book i assume he's actually perfectly aware of the reasons african and/or asian societies are in the state they are. But he he doesn't bother to mention it. This speaks volumes about where he's coming from.<br />  I could go on and on as this book is filled from beggining to end with such \\"facts\\". It's as solid as water its author tries hard to justify his  position with incredible inaccuracies and omissions.<br />  Eschatology and world politics are interesting topics and they involve some of the most brutal truths that humanity has to face. In \\"Coming anarchy\\" the prevailent theme is half truths and distortions passed along as an \\"intellectual\\" approach.one has to acknowledge every single piece of the puzzle and Kaplan very obviously does not care to do that.

As important or pivotal the battle of Crete was, one thing that Anthony Beevor seems to have not grasped in his book is the very special part the Cretan character played in this battle.<BR>    The Cretans are a very particular &quot;tribe&quot;, think of how special we consider the Sicilians or the Corsicans so an analogy is set (even though it wouldn't be accurate still).<BR>   The author becomes almost exhausting in his effort to provide a detailed account of dates, names, locations etc etc..Most of the time i caught myself confused about the locations he was was describing and i'm Greek and have travelled to Crete many times!! In all this complex descriptive network of data he gives us, the essence is really lost and you have the feeling that the book was written with &quot;accountant logic&quot;. Shame because on that merit it's actually not bad, but the paradox is that you emerge not really being sure you've understood why this battle was so important.<BR>    Another thing that contributes to the uneveness of the book is in my opinion the fact that more weight is placed on the British army that there should have. Other historical accounts of the battle of Crete show that the local population was a deciding factor in the German failures there...<BR>   I was actually attracted to this book by another book of Beevor's: &quot;The battle of Stalingrad&quot; which happens to be a stunning book that lacks all the flaws that this one has.

I was told in high school (and not only there) that a construction made of 6 million tons of building material (!!) and with building blocks that weigh anywhere from 10 to 20 tons each and having been lifted as high as 250 feet up was done merely by using 1000s of slaves and primitive cranes..That's how the Egyptian pyramids were supposedly built. Answering to another reviewer here, you would have to be spectacularly gullible to buy such nonsense.<BR>    But I'd rather get to the point. What Colin Wilson is is a self-educated man, a person for whom the term &quot;bibliophile&quot; is a tremendous understatement. His strength as a writer, as many have pointed out, lays in the fact that he takes the works and theories of other people and composes them into his own, weighing the pros and cons in the search for facts, for truth. In this process he remains as open minded as such a task demands and in my opinion this is the biggest credit of respect you can pay to your readers before anything else. Why would we need another &quot;scientist&quot; ruminating the &quot;same ole-same ole&quot; regardless of how absurd or unlikely his theory is just so he fits in with the &quot;knowledge establishment&quot;? No thanks..<BR>    What this books maintains is then nothing that other researchers havent theorised (if not actually PROVEN) before. It provides facts and theories about a maritime civilisation that predated the Egyptians by 1000s of years and which had either the technological know how or simply possesed a totally different thought that enabled them to achieve things that seem incomprehensible to us..According to all these researchers (and Wilson) this civilisation was widely destroyed by a natural disaster but survivors of it transfered their knowledge, or more accurately, their knowledge system, to subsequent civilisations, in this case the Egyptians, but also to the Mayas to name another.<BR>   It's no easy thing to summarise what &quot;From Atlantis to...&quot; proposes as it composes parts and aspects from so many theories. The fairest thing to do is to read the book and allow yourself to be exposed to what it suggests and judge for your own, allthough, it must be said, if you remain/are openminded what will more likely happen is you'll feel inspired to read much-much more on the subject.<BR>    I think that exactly for that fact alone this is a great book from Wilson, it is one that pushes you to open a closet that conventional archaelogists stubbornly consider sealed. Far from... It's also a book that reads through very comfortably considering its task and it is definately very comprehensive on anything it deals with. But then again, for the initiated Wilson readers this is nothing new.<BR>   I am Greek. And Greece is a country filled with ancient &quot;miracles&quot; too which are being explained away by mainstream science with theories that make me laugh. Recently i was up at the Delphi temple. I'd last been there as a kid and hadnt thought much by what i saw. Wilson's books have made me look at things with new eyes. It's not what you believe it's how you come to believe in what you believe. That's why this book and its bibliography as a whole are important.	2002-06-01

A person that lives on the doctrine of &quot;believe without evidence&quot; is a person destined to be a slave and Bakunin's fiery rhetoric does a good job to drive this point home.<BR>     This book might seem polemic to some , especially  those not acquainted with the equation religion=slavery, but then again this is exactly the point.

Sitchin, if you didn't know it already, is one of the leading figures in alternative archaelogy and science in general.<BR>    These days, and especially the last 30-40 years, a &quot;new wave&quot; of scientists and non scientists alike has risen with the intention of re-examining what we as a species consider &quot;knowledge&quot;, knowledge about what we are, and where we come from.<BR>    Sitchin, being one of the few people in the world who can actually read Sumerian, has spent his life examining our origins, and his conclusions have little to do with apes descending trees and miraculously evolving into humans.<BR>    In the &quot;12th planet&quot;, his most famous of his alltogether 9 books, he suggests that we are actually the creation of an alien race which landed on earth more than 450 millenia ago, and who created us as slave labor for their purposes on this planet back then. From then on, and through a myriad interdevelopments and influences, we developed to what we are today.<BR>    Sure, this sounds controversial, and to most people content with swallowing mainstream teachings for &quot;facts&quot; this might seem as pure science fiction. You would have to read this book before you term it as such though. <BR>    It is an exhausting book too, as the author needs to use literally 100s of quotes on original translations he's made in order to make his argument and this isn't just any argument, you understand...<BR>    Exhausting as this book might then be at times, the reward is immense, to put it very mildly. Even if Sitchin happens to be wrong on half of his conclusions what he suggests is mind blowing and shatters to bits most of our current beliefs.<BR>   More importantly, Sitchin can serve you as a gateway to new paths of thinking. It is impossible -i would think- to read the &quot;12th planet&quot; and emerge the same person afterwards, providing of course that you read it with an open mind. All new knowledge recquires an open mind to begin with. This does not mean that you will necessarily agree with Sitchin if you do read it with an open mind, but the evidence he offers is important and solid enough to make you think in a way you've never thought before. <BR>   You ever wondered why we are the only species on this planet that definately does not fit in with its environment? Or why we have so many grey areas and disagreements about where we originate from and how? Or why the word &quot;anthropos&quot; (a greek word) means &quot;the creature that always looks up&quot;? Or even why the root word of the word &quot;earth&quot; comes from the ancient Sumerian (the word e.ri.du) and means &quot;a home far away&quot;? <BR>    The &quot;12th planet&quot; will provide you with some spectacular answers.	2002-05-23

I'd like you to think why i used the heading above. What is \\"important\\", how do you define \\"important\\"? From where we all stand, life is important. Then there is everything that drives life or anything that stops it and then all that characterises it. In the case of the human species, since we are supposedly an intelligent species (i know, that's open to definition too), we have to consider what defines our existence.<BR>   Being that for centuries the concept of \\"god\\" has not only been prevailant in human societies but it has been shaping the morals and the very existence of those societies, this book becomes automatically a very important one. It tackles with the concept of \\"god\\" in a battle which is critical to anyone, the atheist and the theist alike.<BR>    The theist, because in this book he will be faced with all these thoughts and rationale he is, either a) avoiding, or b)not dealt with, and<BR>the atheist, because there is many an atheist around who have not actually thought the whole \\"problem\\" through. Once you are through this book there can't be any issues left untouched regarding the \\"god\\" concept. What will remain is either your stubbornness or your sheer unwillingness to understand, or, better yet, a new wide opened door in your mind to walk through.<BR>   This book is an overwhelming triumph of logic over faith. I dont think i have come across any other book where faith takes such a magnitude of defeat.<BR>   The author (one of the sharpest minds i've had the pleasure to  encounter) deals with \\"god\\" in a thorough \\"no prisoners\\" manner. He reckons with the theories of all major theological schools, and most importantly, he deals with all those classic questions about god that \\"haunt\\" everyone of us since we walked this earth as children. \\"Is there a god\\"? <BR>   He answers this question with a loud \\"no\\" and goes on an amazing marathon of argumentation to drive his point home. The convincingness of his effort, is in my opinion, unparallel, the author literally (but indirectly) challenges you to \\"say it aint so\\" in every page, every chapter, every paragraph.<BR>   There is simply no way to go through this book without feeling challenged, heavily challenged, after you're through with it. You will simply feel the irresistible need to address what the author proposes. Whatever you read next in your life make sure it's this!!!	2002-03-28

How do you go from marijuana and acid to the story of the American Left in the 60s? You don't really have to \\"go\\". Illegal drugs (a painful and tragic mistake of american and worldwide politics) are totally interwoven with the 60s. Naturally, you might say...<BR>   True, but what you might not be aware of is the CIA's involvement with acid as they experimented with the drug for military reasons ( making victims out of 100s of unwitting Americans, especially prisoners) and how acid \\"escaped\\" the lab and spilled onto the streets.<BR>   This book is definately NOT only the history of acid or another book that exposes the CIA's dirty tricks in recent times but what it is essentially is a great history book.<BR>   Stunningly researched (the bibliography alone is a treasure) and convincingly opined \\"Acid Dreams\\" is an accurate account of an era that has been a mystery to some and a landmark for others.<BR>    I have not read a more comprehensive book about the 60s than this one, one that helped me fill many voids i had about what exactly happened during that time and more importantly why it happened. Mind you, there are no myths in it either. Just hardcore reality even if in this case reality borders a mind space trip.<BR>   All the key \\"characters\\" parade through it. Government agents, acid gurus, left wing militants and leftist leaders and scapegoats, the Black Panthers, the Right wing establishment, the  rest of the 3-letter agencies, the international \\"circuit\\", the whole lot. You go on a trip around the world, then one around your mind and then you'll be declared honorary citizen of the place called the \\"Score\\". <BR>    There couldn't possibly be enough i could say about this book to praise it, it's easily among the very best books I ever read with regard to the insights it offers on a topic that has been very much distorted by the corporate media and by the amateur historians used for that purpose. Wow.	2002-03-16

Thing is, the UFO story is one where one has to dedicate a lot of time before he could even come close to any informed view about it.<BR>   What is really flying out there, and more importantly, is there anything weird or \\"non-earthly\\" flying out there at all??<BR>   That's what this book tackles. Flying craft having the appearance of the now cult \\"flying disc\\" were on the drawing boards since the 30s actually. This is fact, proven by several documents that the Nazis left behind. Whether these craft actually ever flew or were tested reamins a question, but there is enough evidence to suggest that not only they did fly, but that such craft were actually tested all through the 50s the 60s and the 70s.<BR>   It's quite plausible that \\"flying disc shaped craft are today's most precious military secret.<BR>   From there on it gets foggy. Why are they still a secret? That question begs an answer, an answer that for the time being ahs not been adequately answered.<BR>  But for anyone interested in the topic, this is essential reading. It's a very well \\"constructed\\" book, it provides actual data (photos, diagrams, dates, names, documents)..And it attempts (to a very satisfactory degree) to sift through the myth and the truth. You cant call yourself a serious researcher in the UFO lore without having read this.	2002-02-18

From what angle should you come from? I mean, here is a book that talks about reptilian aliens living in underground bases in Antarctica and colloborating with Nazi criminals and the US govt to take over the world. And careful: this is NOT a sci-fi novel.Nope, the author professes to be reporting to us the \\"truth\\". And what i am describing above isnt even half as wild as this book is.<BR>   I guess that with the aid of some wonderful herbs this can be a great read (you could wind up having a bad trip of course)...<BR>   Then again if you are a seasoned paranoiac this is just the right stuff for you.	2002-02-18

It's hard to tell if this is a great book of literature or a great history book, but then it`s actually both.<BR>   It's hard to find a history book written in such vivid style and i have read a LOT of history books. Every page takes you literally \\"there\\". While Michael Herr was \\"there\\" of course as he was a war correspondent in \\"'Nam\\" and it shows. All the films youve seen about Vietnam dont amount to this. An accurate description of the american psyche in the one of the dirtiest wars ever conducted. And Herr doesnt mince his words, you get an \\"in your face\\" account of the facts, a gut-stirring story of brutality, dehumanisation, madness, agression and ...war.<BR>    Not to be missed.	2002-02-13

Since this author had worked closely with the Thatcher govt in finance (plus the fact that he is one of the leading economists in europe) added credit goes to his opinion. Gray wastes no time shattering the illusions of those who think globalisation is the way to go, and explains in depth how globalisation and liberal (see: uncontrolled) capitalism is leading to the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor and the total destruction of the social web around the globe. <BR>    This is probably the most important aspect of this book as the author doesnt stand only on the financial side of this issue but tackles the sociological side of it as well which is probably if not more important then just as important as the economic issue at hand.<BR>    He looks with an investigative eye inside societies such as the anglosaxon ones, the japenese and the latin americans, and of course, americans themselves, and opines with crystal clear arguments about where these societies are heading if they get on the globalisation band wagon.<BR>   This book is definately one of the most important books currently on the market, especially when one considers how capitalists are pushing for the globalisation agenda and how uninformed the public is on that issue. Media deception hasnt helped at that either and John Gray is great at clarifying \\"foggy issues\\" for the uninitiated. You care about the future of your society? Buy this book.	2002-02-13

Splendid characters (Bradley himself kix!) terrific dialogues, reads more like an illustrated hilarious sitcom than a comic. And it gets better: the drawing is superb (if that matters to you, but it matters to me) and the plot is never dissapointing. It's kinda like the simpsons with a different edge really. A classic!!!	2002-01-18

This is an excellent book if you're examining the issue of whether aliens in one form or another have really ever visited us..It leaves no stone unturned, looks at the issue from every angle and offers realistic and solid argumentation for the case it presents. And the case it presents is one of cautiousness. Everything from abductions to sightings to dimensional travel to SETI is looked at here. Great read, flows though. You wont regret it.	2002-01-16

Buying this book, i was expecting to a) read about SETI b) be introduced into thinking about the possibility of extraterrestrial life in new ways, as this book, written by Frank Drake one of the men responsible for the establishment of SETI would be a great source..<BR>   Instead: i wound up reading an autobiography disguised under the title &quot;Is there anybody out there&quot;, a title which also disguises the fact that Drake spends more time and pages writting about the problems he encountered setting up SETI than SETI itself. Not to mention that he uses all 300 pages of his book to praise himself in a way that makes you yawn once you become familiar with the mechanism it is written. Indeed for a book that tackles an otherwise super interesting and controversial issue the book is boring. It's totally devoid of any humor and any attempts at such are further contributions to boredom. What's even more interesting is that for an author who clearly believes there is intelligent life out there he uses but a mere 2-3 pages to dismiss any accounts of aliens having already visited earth, recently or not so recently..2-3 pages to dismiss that? Hmmm, makes you wonder...In the end, after having (thankfully) been through with it i wound up thinking more about the motives behind Drake having written it than the book itself. Buy something else on the subject. Blindly.	2002-01-15
