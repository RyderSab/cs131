For the most part I think their charm was sincere.  I certainly hope their consideration was not simply a means of getting something they wanted from me.          <br /> <br />This is really cynical stuff wrapped in \\"spun sugar\\" as  Ms. Rich would say.  I'm not interested in getting what I want if it forces me to live in the affected, inauthentic way Ms. Rich advocates here.	2005-04-17

A strange and then  intriguing fact brought to my attention some 40 years ago by an interesting girl in my 7th grade gym class.  What does it mean, you ask?  Absolutely nothing.<br />Dan Brown attempts to make something out of nothing here by stringing together coincidence, half-baked \\"theories\\" and outright fabrication.  I'm sure in his clever, mercenary hands the Lincoln/Kennedy co-winky-dink could have our constitution and democratic process hanging by a thread.<br />The writing is woefully mediocre, the characters are cartoonish, one dimensional and not very bright.

The irony here is that Brown uses deception to make some kind of case about what he believes are the lies of the church.  His agenda is obvious in the tedious preaching of the unbelievably one dimensional characters.<br />The least he could do is donate some of the profits to a Catholic charity, maybe the Mother Teresa foundation.	2004-02-12

The discovery is hailed as the find of the millenium.  Some proclaim that it will change history as we know it.<br />Sound silly? Of course, yet this is what Elaine Pagel and now Dan Brown have attempted their assertions, based on the so called \\"Gnostic gospels\\", concerning the origins of the Catholic Church, the \\"sacred\\" feminine and the divinity of Christ.<br />It has been said that history is written by the winners.  That might be true, but how true would history written by the non-winners be?  The Gnostics were a group of folks alienated from the mainstream.  Many scholars have described their writings as the tabloid press of the day. If you read the actual writings you will discover they are incredibly strange, nonfeminist and down right antisocial.        <br />As far as the clues in The Last Supper,  it was common for Leonardo to paint young men in an effeminate manner.  Ther is at least one other portrait of St.John, by Leonardo that looks equally as feminine.<br />Regardless of the historical problems with this conspiracy the writing is subpar at best, merely a means by which Brown can take advantage of current anti-Catholic sentiment.<br />I understand that Ron Howard is turning this into a movie.  As a screenplay it might work.	2003-12-20

In other words, it feels like a book written to appeal to women's book groups.      <br />Some 3-4 star reviewers here are simply blowing it off as  not-to-take-seriously  harmless fun.  ....okay, I guess so, but without the controversy this book is juvenile, serial mystery novel stuff and  I left Nancy Drew behind in grade school.  <br />I suggest that you google \\"Dismantling the Da Vinci Code\\" on completion.

Researched using similar tools as in Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, although better written without the artifice of a silly fictious adventure. Indeed, Krakauer has constructed his thesis by suspending a block in mid air then attempting to support it by adding more air.<br />If you look closely at the origins of any religion you will find serious questions.  So what? Just because mom was pregnant when she and dad tied the knot, does that make them less married?<br />Krakauer is an agnostic.  He doesn't think Mormonism is any less valid than Islam.  He thinks that all religion is bogus.  If he had lived next door to Methodists growing up, his thesis would have not changed much, only the cast of characters.	2003-11-13

To suggest that a belief in God or religion is responsible for the violence in this world is naive and dangerous. <br />His thesis is not limited to fundamental Mormonism, he includes all religious belief in his narrow view.   <br />One might be able to make a case for orthodox ideology being a danger to world peace,  but religion is certainly less to blame for violence committed in the name of dogmatic belief than say Nazism, Communism, or any other &quot;ism&quot; that binds a  group of people together in common belief.  <br />More people suffered and died at the hands of regimes based on Godless ideology in the last century than in all of the conflicts of previous centuries combined.<br />Mr. Krakauer needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.  The reasons for the violence in this world is something that we should all be concerned with, but Krakauer's thesis casts a very small net.  <br />The real causes for suffering in this world can be detected in the person of Ron Lafferty, but it isn't due to any real religious belief.  More likely it is due to the blow to his ego that was suffered when his finances fell apart and his wife left him than from any belief that God spoke to him through his computer. The loss of control over his life and the loss of face that he experienced are the reasons for his violence.  He merely used God and his self-proclaimed beliefs as an excuse to act out his violent behavior and convince his equally affected brother to go along.<br />Hopefully the talented Mr. Krakauer will return to his thesis next time with a wider scope.	2003-11-02

The Smart family is criticized in these reviews  because they chose not to focus on the dark side of this tragedy.  They chose not to provide the gritty details of Elizabeth's experience thus depriving the insatiable curiousity of the public and they are condemned for it.  Called mercinary for telling their story the way they experienced it.  <br />If you bought the book, I really don't understand how you can criticize the Smarts for publishing it.  If you are disappointed because of the lack of details I suggest that you  wait for the inevitable exposes that will surely follow in print.  Maybe your cash will be better spent there.<br />If you didn't read the book, what are you doing reviewing it here? Using this forum to air your grievances about inequality is unfair and petty.<br />The book is a nice tribute to the faith of this fine family.  I fail to see why their race and economic situation should be a consideration in the telling of their experience.  We all, regardless of our station, suffer when we are injured.  The Smart family's story in no way demeans the suffering of others.  It is simply their story. <br />The fact is that Ed Smart has been very instrumental in getting the missing child media system alert in place.  And it is very possible that Elizabeth's story has raised the conscience of America in regards to the safety of children.  That and the faith of this remarkable family should be the legacy of this tragedy.	2003-10-31

He provides the first steps well, but admittedly is incapable of providing a synthesis to his work due to his anti-religious worldview.<br />Until he has honed his skills to the level of scholarship and the ability to suspend his own prejudice to an acceptable level, he should avoid such controversial themes.	2003-10-05

Mr McCourt has nothing good to say about anything.  He attacks everything here, captitalism, God, religion, Ireland, England America, rich folk, poor folk, his family with absolutely no wisdom of any kind to contribute.  He seems to find nobility in drunkeness, public nudity promiscuitity and profanity.  What a waste.	2003-09-18

I'm not a Catholic, but I am a Christian and I find the vast majority of the conclusions Brown leaps to in this book laughable.  Take the Last Supper analysis for instance.  That is not Mary Magdalene seated next to Jesus.  It is St. John painted in the same beardless effeminate manner that Da Vinci painted him in his St. John the Baptist portrait.  The hand and knife belong to St. Peter who would later use a knife to cut off the guard's ear in the garden.  Peter is leaning hard on his left elbow to speak to John thus projecting is left hand out.<br />Brown might be right about one thing \\"Everybody loves a conspiracy theory.\\"  So if that is you, buy the book.	2003-09-06

He  writes a compelling tale.  As a reporter, historian and analyst he trips up with a thud.    <br />For example:<br />You can read in the book that Porter Rockwell is believed to  have made an attempt on the Governor Missouri Boggs life in 1842 but Krakauer says \\"...Rockwell had no difficulty eluding arrest. Neither he nor any other Saint was ever brought to justice for the deed.\\"  page 106<BR>    Later in  chapter 19 you can read  Krakauer's assertion that despite the belief of most credible historians - Mormons rather than Shivwitts Indians were responsible for the 1869 murder of 3 members (Dunn and 2 Howland brothers) of the Wesley Powell expedition party.  The most compelling evidence for this assertion Krakauer believes, is that \\"...nobody attempted to punish the Shivwits who'd allegedly killed Dunn and the Howlands--no real effort was even made to recover their valuable guns, scientific instruments or papers from the Indians.\\"      <BR>     After reading this last quote on page 244 I wondered -if lack of punishment is evidence for innocence, why doesn't Krakauer apply that same reasoning to  Porter Rockwell's alleged attempt on Bogg's life?<BR>     But wait -- it turns out that Krakauer got it very wrong on page 106. Rockwell was indeed arrested, but never indicted.  Due to lack of evidence, he was eventually released. <BR>     This in Missouri where  Bogg's  had issued an extermination order on all Mormons.  An order that wasn't officially removed until about 20 years ago.  It would seem that the state of Missouri and Governor Bogg's suddenly became very generous to Mormonfolk. But this is beside my point which is:<br />I would like to see Krakauer come back with an addendum at least, to answer the questions that have been raised concerning his scholarship.   Maybe even issue a revised more balanced edition.  As it stands, it seems to be akin to the Fox News channel's idea of \\"fair and balanced\\" journalism.	2003-08-09
US	52804799	RAF8VEPF22FY	014016930X	21744022	Angle of Repose (Contemporary American Fiction)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	astonishing	I just finished this book and it remains at my side as I write this review.  I found the book compelling from the beginning and recognized myself in Susan  at times for better or worse.   Oliver, the often misunderstood manly man that he was, never quite knew what he had taken on in marrying this woman so above him in every way or at least we never know as &quot;he left no novels, stories, drawings, or reminiscense to speak for him.&quot;  The assumptions of his grandson, who &quot;only knew him as an old man,&quot; are all we have to go on and they are all we need to love Oliver and wish that he might have found in Susan what he needed and yes -- she in him.  I don't judge her as harshly as some. I think because we know more about her, we feel entitled to.  We think she should have known better.  They both did, but they were compelled to do what they must and their lives finally intersected again in their years of repose and in the end as their grandson, Lyman, honored their memory with the wisdom he gained from their story.	2001-04-04
