One day in 1680 twelve Indian prisoners are brought into town, accused of plotting against the Spanish government. Turns out, one of the \\"plotters\\" is a beautiful young woman and gifted storyteller, Serafina.<br /><br />The Governor strikes an odd bargain with this Serafina. For every night that she entertains him with a story he will free one of the prisoners. Sounds like the Thousand And One Nights, but with some unusual twists. Not only are the lives of the prisoners at stake, and that of Serafina, but the future of the territory. Can the Spanish colonials and the native peoples cross their cultural divide and live in peace? Can the stories of the gifted Serafina bring them together? Or is it already too late?<br /><br />Well, you simply have to read this book. Author Rudolfo Anaya writes in a beautiful, heartfelt style, sprinkling his clear, simple English with Spanish words and phrases, to create a vivid impression of the old Southwest. Loosely based on actual historical events, the story is as meaningful as ever in a time when peoples and cultures are struggling to coexist. The stories are so well done that they become more than stories. They speak to the reader personally. This book is easily read but will move you deeply. I recommend it most highly.

Once he was a little boy growing up in a strange chaotic family of twelve kids, and a mother who was--different. Was she black? white? What? She wouldn't talk much about it.Later in life James is determined to find out who his mother is, so that he can understand who he himself is. Out of that search he has written this wonderful, deeply moving book.<br /><br />Ruth, his Mom, is really Rachel Shilsky, daughter of an orthodox Jewish family from Poland, who grew up leading a life of quiet desperation in one of the most dysfunctional families you will ever read about. Ruth leaves her family and religion behind to start a new life of constant challenge. After many years of running from her history, she is finally forced to confront it under her son's insistent questioning.<br /><br />Author James McBride writes in clear, lucid prose. The book flows easily and is delightful reading. It is a tribute to his mother, but it is also a tribute to the human spirit, the crossing of uncrossable barriers, and overcoming of impossible obstacles. It is a story of social change in America, the changing relationship of races and relgions, and the search for identity. It is all these things and well done. I recommned this one highly.

She creates such a powerful French atmosphere for her story that I had to look and make sure this wasn't a translation.

When the father, Charles, falls ill, the family takes up residence in a Mexican neighborhood in Los Angeles, and the family's nomadic idyll comes to an end.

The book is not tightly plotted, it simply flows and develops, very much like real life.

This book has been offered to many of our great religious figures over the years, but none has ever read more than a few pages. Of course, Rebecca reads the whole thing, and so will you, but you will find it most disturbing. The views expressed are not, most likely, those of God, but of author Julius Lester, and they represent a dark and troubling theology.<br /><br />This is a very offbeat novel--part novel, part dissertation on the great questions.

Later, she was exiled permanently from Chile after the military coup of 1973. She writes about her native country as one who, having stepped outside her culture, can no longer return to it as a native, but sees it from the outside. She is a perpetual foreigner now, an outsider in every culture, and so she sees things others miss.

She also reveals a great deal of her own inner self, creaing a powerful bond of intimacy with her readers.<br /><br />This is a book which transcends time and place. Written in a simple, conversational style, it draws the reader in, engages, delights, and amazes. And it causes the reader to think and reflect.

They have an enjoyable senior year, playing sports, going to movies, and even exchanging \\"e-mails\\" with students from Spain. As we say goodbye to Enrique and Maria their friendship is ripening into--well, maybe, something more. So, what will finally happen? You will just have to read the book to find out--in Spanish.<br /><br />Two subsequent sections of the book comprise a brief history of Mexico--in full blood and gore--from the Aztecs to Vicente Fox; and a shortened adaptation of a classic 16th century Spanish work, Lazarillo do Tormes.<br /><br />Easy Spanish Reader is based on the concept that you learn quickest by simply reading. The lessons are progressive so that you learn quickly, incorporating new words based on context. There are no tedious grammar lessons or vocabulary lists. No verb conjugations. Everything explains itself, except for a small number of marginal glosses for new vocabulary words. As other reviewers have noted, a certain rudimentary knowledge of Spanish is essential to use this book, but it can be minimal. The concept works, partly because English and Spanish share so many words and concepts. Exercizes after each lesson help to consolidate what has been learned.<br /><br />The only flaw I could find is that the glossary at the back is incomplete. There are a few words you will just have to guess at. I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and I feel it has greatly enhanced my knowledge of Spanish. I recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

As the young narrator struggles with his friend's terminal illness, the two men embark on a project to pass the time and keep up their spirits. They decide to write a novel about an imaginary family--the Roccamatios of Helsinki, whose lives parallel, year by year, the years of the twentieth century. We are not told much about this novel or its characters. The writing, the research, the assembling of facts about the twentieth century, are used to highlight the illness and death of the friend.<br /><br />Also included are a story about a Viet Nam veteran, a talented but unrecognized composer who struggles with the meaning of life while working as a night custodian in a bank. And a composition about the night a young man is hanged (for some unnamed crime), the story told in multiple variations, over and over. The book concludes with a strange tale of an old machine that makes mirrors out of memories. And about the importance of memory itself.<br /><br />Author Yann Martel does not shrink from the extreme and unusual. After all, he wrote the novel about a young man in a lifeboat with a tiger, and made it almost believable. The stories in this small collection are similarly over-the-edge. They are well written, clever, almost too clever. For me the author allows his cleverness and his mastery of the language to overshadow the characters. The stories are not meant to be literally believeable, but, in the end, they are not emotionally believable either.<br /><br />Still, these stories are well worth reading. If you liked the Life of Pi you will love the Roccamatios as well. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.	2005-01-29

Within days, everyone who has come in contact with the man also has the white blindness--the ophthalmologist who saw him as an emergency, the man who helped him to get home (and also stole his car), and so on. Soon it is evident that a strange plague of blindness is sweeping the city. The authorities react with panice, herding all the newly blind people into internment in an abandoned mental hospital.<br /><br />Things quickly deteriorate. Food is sporadic. Sanitation non-existent. The veneer of civilization crumbles in a series of horrific scenarios that reminded me of Lord Of The Flies. Anyone who tries to escape is shot on sight. A handful of thugs takes control of the food and uses it to extort from, and humiliate, the other blind people. No need to belabor the plot--there are many other reviews.<br /><br />The book is a deep and frightening look at what it means to be human. It is also an exploration of human courage, resilience and caring. This is my third Saramago novel, and definitely the best. The author's unusual writing style has been noted by other reviewers. Endless paragraphs, minimal punctuation, no quotation marks at all. None of the characters have names. It takes some getting used to, but in this book it worked well. A nobel prize author can break a few rules!<br /><br />I had to put the book down frequently because it was so emotionally demanding, so ruthless in its portrayal of the dark side of humanity. Despite this it is also a book of redemption. Blindness is a work of genius and I can't recommend it too highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.	2005-01-13

In this book he has just moved to a 40 acre farm in upstate New York, leaving his wife behind in the city. And, in the process, acquires a small herd of sheep and two donkeys. You see, he is now obsessed with Border Collies, and they are obsessed with herding sheep.<br /><br />Training the dogs to work as a team and herd sheep is not easy, in fact it is almost beyond Katz's abilities except on those rare occasions when he can keep quiet and trust the dogs' judgment. He comes to the insight that in order to train these dogs he will have to be a better human. And that is his project through the rest of the book, a devilishly hard winter, and all the misadventures that could possibly happen to a rookie farmer who hasn't a clue.<br /><br />Fortunately, his neighbors and townspeople take him under their collective wings and help him muddle through. If they regard him as a silly \\"flatlander\\" who has no business attempting this adventure, they are kind enough not to say so.<br /><br />Author Jon Katz has written a number of books. He is fluent and elegant writer, who offers a wealth of interesting observations about rural life, sheep, donkeys, dogs, \\"dog people\\" (who only relate to other people through their dogs), and human nature. The book is easy reading and entertaining, if a little superficial. The only real drawback, for me, was author Katz's excessive preoccupation with himself and his inner conflicts. I would have liked to learn more about the animals. Still, the book works, and I recommend it. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.	2005-01-07

The time is 1965, just as the Los Angeles riots are winding down. For a change, for one brief shining moment, the LA police need his help, to find the killer of a young black woman. For that brief period he carries a letter from the Deputy Commissioner, authorizing him to conduct this semi-official investigation. Reason--if the wrong suspect turns out to be the right suspect, it might re-ignite the riots.<br /><br />That is the plot, but the plot is really unimportant. What makes the novel wonderful is the profusion of down-home earthy characters, the men, the women, the relationships, and the fault-lines of racial distrust (suspicion, fear, hatred) that run just below the surface of LA society.<br /><br />This is my third Walter Mosley novel, and so far, the best of all. Mosley is a brilliant writer, who brings out his characters strengths and weaknesses. Some of them are terribly flawed, men walking at the edge of the abyss, crazed people, homicidal people, and people who love each other intensely--Somehow he makes them all believable. the writing flows easily, the dialect rings true, and I felt like I knew what made these people tick.<br /><br />Author Mosely has a unique African-American voice, and he explores a realm that most white Americans are not aware of. And will never experience directly. Yet he makes it understandable, even believable.<br /><br />Little Scarlet is an outstanding novel, and I recommend it highly.

A colleague suggests he rent a certain movie. A bit player in the movie turns out to look exactly as he does. The history teacher becomes obsessed with this man, ruminates about the nature of identity, and sets out to find this man who looks like him.<br /><br />Eventually the two men meet, but instead of feeling a kinship or a sense of being brothers they react to each other with suspicion, mistrust and resentment. Their identical appearance is taken to mean that only one of them can be the real person--the other is merely a copy. But which one? The question is explored in long-winded excess by Tertuliano, a man who is pathetically self-absorbed and thinks too much.Meanwhile he neglects and misuses everyone around him.<br /><br />Thus begins a love-hate (shall we say) relationship that ends in disaster. I will say no more about the plot--you will just have to read the book.<br /><br />Author Jose Saramago is not for everyone, and this book in particular is not for everyone. As a nobel laureate I suppose he is permitted to break all the rules of novel-writing, and he certainly does. He does not \\"show\\" what the characters are thinking and feeling, he \\"tells\\" us--in excruciating detail. He constantly intrudes into the action with authorial commentary, laughing at the characters, telling us what is going to happen to them, analyzing their actions, and philosophizing. Some of his thoughts are brilliantly put, but getting at them is hard work. I found this novel unbearably tedious and hard to read until I was half-way through it. In the last half, things began to pick up, and in the last hundred pages, it was hard to put it down.The surprise ending was stunning.<br /><br />Conclusions: If you're a fan of Saramago you will like it.

Asher is his older brother, hero and role model, a gifted artist in full-blown rebellion against their father and everything he stands for. Abram is the father--a man who fancies himself as an actor, an impresario, a great pillar of the Jewish community--but who actually is a fragile narcissistic personality. His self-esteem depends on getting his family to perform and bring him glory.<br /><br />Need it be said? This is a very dysfunctional family, and over the next five years things go from bad to much much worse.

Alva and Irva Dapps, eccentric twin sisters, never had an easy life. Their father died the day they were born, when his scandalous malfeasance at the post office was abruptly discovered. Their mother was oddly reclusive. The girls themselves, strangely symbiotic, struggled with their sense of identity, and even more so, with their sense of place. And their city, Entralla, somewhere in--perhaps--Europe, is somehow symbolic of all places, all home-towns, and all sense of belonging. Somehow the twins become involved in making plasticine models of the buildings of Entralla, all the buildings, creating a gigantic model of the entire city. And somehow this comes to have cosmic importance, later, as certain tragic events take place.<br />The book is written alternately as a guidebook for tourists coming to Entralla, and as the memoir of Alva Dapps, the more outgoing of the two sisters. It comes complete with a detailed map, recommendations of where to stay and where to dine, which trolley bus to take to which destination; and the sad inner struggles of two odd and lonely girls who never belong anywhere.<br />Author Edward Carey is imaginative and insightful,but he doesn't always make things easy for his readers.

He is assured that lots of \\"in\\" people are doing this now, becoming \\"newbodies,\\" with a whole new chance at life, youth, sex, and time.<br />Good deal? Maybe not. Maybe not so good if you can't take your status with you, if you can't take your friends with you, or your wife, or your relationships. Maybe not if somebody wants your new young body enough to kill you for it, and there's no way to get back to your own.<br />Yes, the concept is preposterous. It isn't science fiction, as there is no attempt to bring in any science. However it is a concept that has occurred to most of us at one time or another. What if we could live again, be young again, with all the wisdom we've acquired by aging? Would you do it? Would I? Might be fun for a while, but there would be a price to pay. Maybe more than I would be prepared to pay.<br />Author Hanif Kureishi does a wonderful job with the concept, writing in an elegant, literary style that is simply a delight to read. This is not a book you should over analyze, just enjoy it and let it stimulate your thinking. Yes, the premise is absurd, but the book works. I enjoyed it immensely and I recommend it highly.

After an all too brief period of notoriety as a child prodigy, Johannes ends up in the napoleonic wars, almost loses his life, and then meets Erasmus. Erasmus is a violin maker of the school of Stradivari, the last of his school. Johannes wants to write the greatest opera of all time. Erasmus wants to make the greatest violin ever made--the black violin. And both of them are strangely haunted by a mysterious womanly voice, the voice of Carla, perhaps the most beautiful voice of all time.<br />This is a short book, easily read in one or two sittings. It is powerfully written, in a simple, lucid style. It is a fable, a parable, not meant to be taken literally. Like any parable it can be taken on many levels. What does it mean to be a genius? What is the point of striving for perfection? What is the price of greatness? Will either man succeed? And if he does, what will it cost him?

But &quot;prot&quot; is remarkably well-adjusted, displays no obvious symptoms, and gets along famously with staff and fellow patients. Only one thing--he has a delusion (?) that he is a visitor from a planet named K-Pax--a utopian world with no crime, no violence, no need for laws or government.<br />Prot is the doctor's most fascinating case. But what exactly is the diagnosis? Is he really a space alien? Delusional? Split personality? And is he really going to depart for K-Pax on a date certain, as he insists? Can Dr. Brewer break through his defenses and find what makes him tick? And if he can, should he? You will just have to read the book to find the answers.<br />This is one of those novels looking back to the time when psychiatrists actually spent hours talking to their patients, when quirky patients with odd hang-ups spent months or years languishing in psychiatric hospitals, and when it really seemed to matter what the &quot;underlying cause&quot; of a patient's malady might be. Those days are long gone, but the concept lingers on as a cultural myth. So this novel is part of a grand tradition. In this mythic tradition, the patients are often not sick at all, indeed they may have greater wisdom than those who treat them. So it is with &quot;K-Pax&quot; where the enigmatic prot is remarkably helpful to his fellow patients and even staff, in a way the busy psychiatrist can't begin to emulate.<br />Author Brewer's writing is pedestrian but readable. He has obviously read a lot about psychiatric matters, though his knowledge is clearly second-hand. The story drags a bit, but it raises interesting questions and is worth reading. If you are a fan of those mythic psychiatrists and their mythic hospitals, well, this book might be for you. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber	2004-05-21

What is the secret of its success? Why is it closed on Sunday? Why is it not publicly held? (No, you can't buy stock in it). Where did they get those cows who can't spell? And who is the man behind the concept? In this deceptively short book, S. Truett Cathy talks about his life story and the story of this business.<br />It is a fascinating American story, a story of struggling up from hard times, building a business with impressive perseverance and personal commitment, and most important, a story of principles. For this is a company that eschews contemporary business fads and slogans, treats its people like valued assets, prizes and practices loyalty, and believes that Christianity should be lived, not just preached.<br />Interspersed with author Cathy's memoirs are brief vignettes from several Chik-fil-A operators (what they call franchisees), and from others who have blossomed under Cathy's encouraging ministrations. He does a lot more than sell chicken sandwiches. He has made a life work of encouraging others. He also sponsors a network of foster homes, and is (appropriately) proud of the many, hundreds, of children who call him their grandfather.<br />Although it is a short book, it is intense, and it is challenging, because it makes you ask yourself questions. It is not the light reading it appears to be. It forces you to look at your own values, loyalty, and commitment. It is well worth reading.

There are no etymologies, no learned dissertations, just simple, practical modern definitions.

Jada Pinkett is an old broken down pit bull who has had a late-life ephiphany and now tries to help other animals. Eric is a teen-aged boy who works at the pet store, a young man with the only conscience in the book. All these and many other characters, like refugees from Winesburg, Ohio, seem to blunder through life, drinking their way toward disaster.<br />As noted by another reviewer, the book is more like a collection of intertwining short stories than a novel. There is no attempt to bring all the stories or the characters together. The unifying element is the terrain, Memphis and northern Mississippi. The epicenter of the story is the bar at the Peabody hotel, where the characters find themselves for their first drinks of the evening.<br />Author Larry Brown is a skilled writer and is able to keep all these characters and their sad stories moving at a brisk pace. Unfortunately most of the characters are not only unlikeable but also not quite believable. They spend far too much time drinking, drugging and bemoaning their sad fates; their attempts to rise out of the muck are feeble at best. It is hard for the reader to empathize with them as they consistently do what they know is wrong and their lives progressively fall apart.

His family is wildly dysfunctional, his relationships are disastrous, his therapist gives up, his luck is forever running out. And, when it seems that things couldn't possibly get any worse, well, you guessed it.<br />Author Sue Townsend is a brilliant comedic writer, but in this work, the comedy is darkly satirical. The hero (or anti-hero) Mole was first introduced in her earlier work, The Secret Diaries, when he was not quite fourteen. Hilarious it was, then, to see him percieve the inconsistencies of the adult world without ever really understanding what was happening. Now that he is older, the humor is darker, with a biting edge. For this young man is now moving into his mid-twenties, without apparently growing or learning anything of value. So, is there hope for poor Mole? Will he ever grow up? Will he ever get a girlfriend? You will just have to read the book and see.<br />While other reviewers expressed disappointment in the book, I enjoyed it immensely. It is different from the Secret Diaries with a different type of humor. Take it on its own terms and you will laugh yourself silly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.	2004-02-01

He fell while mountain climbing, and is now severely brain-damaged. Living in a group home, probably one of the best of its kind, he spends his days dependent on what he calls \\"paid caregivers.\\" Now he is writing his journal, trying to put his jumbled thoughts on paper (on computer) with the help of Ellen, his volunteer writing coach.<br />It is a painful exploration, for Robert has probably reached his maximum improvement. In his thoughts he is sensitive and articulate but few people can understand what he is saying. His mobility is limited. He needs help for the most basic activities of daily living. Although the care he receives is excellent, it is also demeaning. He talks about the artificially bright  demeanor of those who work with him, but seldom have time to listen to him. Like other patients with closed head injuries he is often impulsive, easily loses his temper, and sometimes shows poor judgment. His feeble attempts to relate sexually are considered \\"inappropriate\\" by those around him.<br />Author Tim Laskowski, who has worked with brain damaged patients for many years, explores the inner world of Robert with great empathy and sensitivity. He does this with extraordinary skill, without ever falling into sentimentality. His use of language is flawless, managing to hit just the right pitch for this difficult subject matter. And, if he doesn't completely understand the inner world, the suffering and small triumphs, of Robert's life, he probably comes as close as anyone could.

Not much happens after that except the increasingly stormy relationship between these two very different men, their dialogue, and Blakey's desperate attempts to maintain his sanity.

And what stories they are! Fantastic fables of a mythic empire that has existed, risen, fallen and risen again for countless ages. Stories of emperors, the wise, the foolish, the mad, the bad and the good. And most of all, stories of human folly and madness, stories of how human beings go astray following their thoughts or emotions--anger, bitterness, resentment, lust, greed.<br />The stories can be taken on many levels--as simple tales, or as allegories about the human condition. And because they are always told in this detached way--by a nameless storyteller--they acquire a mythic resonance. It doesn't matter whether any of it &quot;really&quot; happened. The last story in the collection is just a little different, well, surprising. And I won't tell you how it ends.<br />Author Angelica Gorodischer is an Argentine writer, previously unavailable in English, and she is translated here by that engaging fabulist, Ursula K. Le Guin.

And yet, even as she is working this out, she is being drawn to Jesus, and her second conversion, ending up as an Anglican Christian.

A short book, 157 pages, it consists of two parts. The first is an extended allegory about a young man named Ordinary, who pursues his Big Dream through many obstacles and struggles, at the behest of the Dream Giver (God). In doing so he must leave his home in the land of Familiar, leave his Comfort Zone and deal with the Border Bullies, who include his family and closest friends. Author Wilkinson uses a lot of capital letters to make sure we don't miss his points.<br />In the second half he talks to the reader, explaining his concepts in more detail, for any who might not have &quot;gotten it&quot; the first time round. He gives examples from his own life and ministry, exhorting, cheerleading and cajoling us onward to the fulfillment of our Big Dreams.<br />The book is easy to read, uplifting and entertaining. I managed to finish it in little more than one afternoon. Author Wilkinson has a gift for communication and his writing conveys the sense of personal contact. Unfortunately, he has left out some important elements that would have given the book more balance. Not all Big Dreams are to be followed relentlessly. Some dreams are misguided or even delusional. The author meant to say, I think, that certain dreams--dreams from God, dreams of service and ministry--are to be pursued. Dreams of winning the sweepstakes or becoming a world dictator--maybe not. But, he didn't say it. I think he also meant to say that one should exercise discernment in following a Big Dream. Pray about it, get advice from others, ask questions. Is it really a Big Dream or is it just restlessness, a hankering for change. Maybe your purpose in life is right where you find yourself.  But author Wilkinson doesn't say that either.<br />The Dream Giver is an entertaining, uplifting book--but lacking in balance. Take it with a grain of salt. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.is N.

This is a mythic book, a surrealistic allegory about identity. A person is nothing more or less than the stories he tells about himself, so it seems to be saying, stories that may be based in reality or made up out of whole cloth. Maybe even stories that belong to someone else. Author Cauwelaert explores this concept in flowing, readable prose.<br />Although the story begins in delightful absurd whimsy, it gradually becomes more somber, more convoluted, more self-consciously significant.

If they married, it didn't work out. If they had children, they typically abandoned them. If they did have good marriages, they lost them.<br />Most of the characters are old or aging men, most of the action takes place in Chicago. Most are Jewish, in a Seinfeldian, cultural sense, and have little relationship to Judaism, the religion. They are often uncomfortable with or embarrassed by their Jewish origins. Still, they display that typical Jewish penchant for ruminating, philosophizing, wondering who they really are.<br />Author Joseph Epstein is an extremely talented writer. He does a great job with these stories, injecting bits of manic humor into these otherwise gloomy tales. Still, there is something troubling about the collection, something that leaves--well--a certain unpleasant aftertaste. The stories that start out with so much punch, that are so entertaining, almost always seem to end with a whimper, with nothing learned, nothing gained, nothing to hope for.

Somehow she keeps them both alive by talking, talking, talking, quoting poetry, and trying to get him into a bookstore. Then, suddenly he runs away.<br />The remainder of the book follows Ellis as she tries to deal with this experience, with her friends, with the police, with her room-mate, with a series of half-hearted affairs, and with a mediocre therapist. Along the way she reconnects with her family and follows her mother on a mission trip to the Phillipines. It's all a little loose, sometimes goofy, always unpredictable right up to the surprising ending.<br />I was hooked on this book from page one, but then, alas, in the aftermath to the incident, it began to drag. There were too many shallow characters, too many frivolous encounters, too little trauma. It was hard to connect with all these characters; hard to connect the events into a meaningful story. Still, author Vendela Vida has a good way with language, and the story is generally entertaining. If you're looking for a light-hearted read with an unusual angle, I can recommend this one.

She begins with her own life-story and family background, It is a deeply moving, often shocking account of abuse, gratuitous violence, alcoholism, and the struggle for a better life. This first chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book, in which she explores the roots of our violent culture.<br />Author Phillips does not offer any quick fixes, but she is unsparing in her critique of our materialistic society. We must change our priorities, she says, and give up the fruitless struggle for power and control. She has done a prodigious amount of research for the book, delving deeply into the fields of sociology, psychology, philosophy, child development and comparative religion in laying out her case. The question is asked in many different ways: what are your true priorities? Until we get our priorities straight and turn from the blind pursuit of more and better stuff...well, you get the picture.<br />This is a remarkable book, but it is not for everyone. It is definitely not light reading. If you are looking for a book that will cause some soul-searching, that might make you uncomfortable, this one is definitely worth your time. Reviewed by Louis N.

Jerry Mason, the protagonist and narrator, is a struggling (and probably mediocre) artist, with two great loves in his life. LeeAnne is his faithful, rock-steady, ever-cheerful wife. Hannah is the mercurial guitar-playing free spirit who flits about the edges of his life, bears him a child, and flames out in the fiery auto crash she had predicted for herself for years.<br />Unfortunately, Jerry never quite achieves the maturity to make a final commitment to either of these women. He continues to live in a half-real world of philosophizing, day-dreaming, painting and jam sessions.<br />Author Tim Farrington is a brilliant writer, who paints (yes, paints) his characters and scenes in exquisite, evocative language. He has a remarkable gift for characterization. His prose is literary and poetic, filled with vivid images. Only his character of LeeAnne was somehow hard to believe, swinging abruptly from all too passive acceptance of Jerry's behavior to sudden, explosive, tantrums.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely although not as much as The Monk Downstairs. I think author Farrington is a great writer who is still improving his craft. Still, Blues For Hannah is a poignant and moving book and I recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.	2003-09-06

Off the beaten path, it caters to a few well-heeled visitors, and the townspeople want to keep it that way. Then Colonel George Custard (no, not Mustard) arrives for a weekend visit, and reveals his plan to build a huge five-star hotel that will put Magdalena out of business. Then, alas, he is murdered. Well, guess who has to solve the crime? That is the story in a nutshell.<br />Between the murder and the solution we encounter the \\"characters\\" of this little town-from the bumbling police chief Melvin Stolzfus to the irascible piano teacher Miss Quiring to the Reverend Richard Nixon (no relation to the other one) to the Colonel and his offbeat entourage. Author Myers writes with manic humor, packing every sentence with puns, jokes, word-play, and lots of alliteration. She clearly enjoyed writing this book. Here and there she throws in recipes for various types of custard.<br />If you are looking for a serious mystery, this book is not for you.

And with the haunting memories of her first love, Michael, her awakening, and the terrible way it ended. Now she is living in Santa Fe, lost as it were in haunting memories, and unable to pick up with her life.<br />That is the plot in a nutshell. The story weaves back and forth in time. It is written in an elevated  \\"literary\\" style, long sentences laden with adjectives, intense descriptions of colors, odors, textures, fabrics and fastenings. It is as though the author were painting the scenes rather than writing them. Sometimes it becomes just a bit overdone, over-wrought.

He finds some work as a roofer, bunks with his old friend and mentor, Pete Culpepper, tries to patch things up with his old flame, Etta. The scene is a rural community in decline, a community of failing farms and horse-racing, dominated by Stanton Stables. And the heir to Stanton Stables is Sonny, a man of  greed and entitlement and a bullying temperament, who is Ray Dokes' nemesis.<br />There is no finely crafted plot here. The characters try to survive and get ahead, engage in harebrained schemes, drink far too much, do some really bad things, and plot against Sonny. So what will happen? Will Sonny get what he so richly deserves? Will Etta lose her farm to the Stanton Empire? Will Ray go back to prison? You will have to read the book to find out. The beauty of this novel is in the characters. Canadian author Brad Smith is a genius at characterization. He creates a whole community of flawed but real people-losers, down-and-outers, and survivors-and one great villain-out of simple materials-gestures, turns of speech, and-most of all-hats. Horses, too, every one of them a real personage. Every one of these characters becomes real, complex and likeable in spite of their shortcomings. Even Sonny gets a little sympathy, but not much.<br />The bleak atmosphere of a declining farm community is beautifully evoked. The sadness of broken relationships and lost opportunities is deeply moving. Yet life goes on, somehow, and no one can say what the future will bring. All Hat is a must read. I cannot recommend  it  too highly. Reveiwed by Louis N. Gruber.	2003-08-09

He has dreamed of this moment for years. Hayley is his best friend's sister and--well--a goddess. Things couldn't be any better.<br />But then, within ten minutes, his dream date turns to dust. He doesn't see Hayley again for the rest of the evening, and--without revealing too much of the plot--the evening ends in tragedy. The remainder of the book tells how Matt and his teen-aged friends deal with these events.<br />The story moves along quickly, taking the reader into the inner world of Matt and his young friends, their struggles, their hurts, and their loss of innocence. The dialogue is snappy and smart, written in teen-age Aussie slang. The characters grow on you. The events are believable. Toward the end, I think, the story tends to get bogged down in in a bit of sentimentality, but this is a minor flaw. The book is an enjoyable read and I recommend it. Reviewed by Louis N.

Lee Nez is a New Mexico state policeman, who happens to be a Navajo and steeped in Navajo lore. One night on patrol he has the terrible misfortune of being caught up in the ambush of a military convoy by a group of German spies (this is during World War II) trying to seize a shipment of weapons-grade plutonium. The leader of this operation is Hans Gruber (no relation to this reviewer) who--as it happens--is also a vampire. And the upshot of the whole episode is that Lee becomes at least a partial vampire--a walker of the night--doomed to a lonely life in which he will never die and must always be careful to avoid sunlight.<br />Fifty-some years later, now under the name Leonard Hawk, he is again a New Mexico state patrolman, and now the stage is set for a re-match with his nemesis, the evil German vampire, Gruber--who is now under the name Muller. And this time he is thrown in with an attractive female FBI agent, Diane Lopez, who will cause him to rethink his solitary existence. The adventure unfolds with lots of violence, supernatural creatures, bungling officials, obtuse Germans, and a hint of romance. So what happens? Will Lee survive? Will Lee and Diane get together? Will the Germans get the plutonium? Will the evil shapeshifters destroy the German vampires, or vice versa? You will just have to read it to find out.<br />This book requires a MAJOR suspension of disbelief. Even if you buy into Navajo vampires and shapeshifters who turn into animals, you still have a state patrolman who has to keep daubing himself with sunblock to get through the day and keeps containers of blood in his refrigerator for an emergency power snack. The book was fun and moved along quickly, but as others have mentioned, the dialogue was often stilted and hard to believe.

More likely he is running from floor to floor, helping his fellow workers as their union representative; more likely yet he is pursuing some lead as an amateur sleuth. He becomes really busy when a pretty young drug rep, Colleen Creedon, is found mysteriously dead in a supposedly unoccupied hospital room.<br />The plot gets rather complicated, as the attractive young woman seems to have been involved with several members of the hospital staff, particularly the famous (and egotistical) transplant surgeon, Dr. Kadish. Figuring out what--and who--caused her death leads to an ever-widening circle of intrigue. Meanwhile work goes on, with the daily struggle of poorly treated workers against a heartless administration and declining budgets. Lenny walks close to the edge, matching wits with the sadistic security man, West, who desperately wants to get him fired. The author clearly has a heart for working people, and, one senses, a certain distaste for physicians, especially pompous physicians.<br />Author Sheard creates wonderful, likeable characters, and the  caring community wherein they work and try to support one another. His writing draws you in, and you just keep turning pages. If, in the end, the plot doesn't really hang together, or the explanation of Colleen's death doesn't make much sense--well, who cares?

Plus, they are docile, respect authority, and don't care about money or sex. If such creatures existed, they would be ideal for--well--slavery. And that is exactly what happens in the novel Sims, where all sims are owned by giant corporation SimGen.<br />Of course, this raises all kinds of questions. Who is a human? What rights would sims have in this brave new world? Do they have souls? What if they started asking for things? Like, what if they wanted to start their own labor union, to petition for things like being able to stay together as a \\"family\\"? And what if a bright young lawyer, like Patrick Sullivan, impulsively decided to take their case?

Thought provoking issues, adventure, danger, thrills, a heroine with great legs, a lawyer with a conscience, villains and super-villains. Author F. Paul Wilson is perhaps better known for his Repairman Jack novels, about a man who definitely fixes things, inside or outside the law. He creates great characters, and keeps you turning pages. And he does so in Sims, as well.<br />On the downside, the book has a somewhat slap-dash quality as though it was put together in haste.

As the story begins she is returning to India for the first time in seven years, and she will have to tell her family about her American boyfriend.<br />As expected, it doesn't go well. Priya's family are deeply set in traditional (Hindu) values--daughters are supposed to be submissive, they are supposed to marry nice (Indian) boys, and produce nice male heirs. Marriages are supposed to be arranged by the family elders, and love doesn't have much to do with it. While Priya is working herself up to tell the family, and dreading the moment with all her being, family life goes on, with its tensions, rivalries, acceptance, rejection, and--most of all--cooking. Cultures are clashing like great tectonic plates below the earth, while on the surface the women are busy chopping and slicing. The book is full of interesting, spicy recipes, too--one of the most gastronomical novels I have ever read.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Author Malladi has a deft way with characterization.

Do it today.<br />Author Zubry, who recently published Miles of Experience, is an engineer, a soviet emigre, a world-traveler, a gifted story-teller, and probably a genius. In this book, he allows himself free rein to explore the dark side (of everything!) and to express his thoughts. He doesn't hold back or censor himself. Out it comes--brilliant, hilarious, sometimes silly, sometimes upsetting. Always a new and different perspective. Dark, satiric essays, comic sketches, poetry, aphorisms. Everything is here.<br />Arrogance is not my favorite Zubry work. Some of the pieces are too long and should have been ruthlessly abridged. I think a good editor could have done wonders with it. And I would probably have eliminated most of Zubry's poetry. He is a brilliant essayist, not (in my opinion) a poet. Still, it's a work worth reading. If curmudgeonly  satire is your cup of tea; if you like Andrei Codrescu or Andy Rooney, you are sure to like Arrogance of Truth. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.	2003-05-04

And, at the climactic moment of the act, he disappears. Really disappears into thin air. Poof! And his family is devastated.<br />So how do they cope? How do they change? Will things ever be made right? The author looks deeply into each of the characters--the father, the mother, the big sister, the clown who set it all in motion, the policeman who is supposed to guard the family--and explores their inner worlds.  How will they deal with grief? What childhood demons still pursue them? What are their dreams and hopes? And what fantasies of magic and power do they still hold dear?<br />A profoundly psychological study of loss, grief and coping, magic is the metaphor that holds it together. Magic as illusion. Magic as escape. And the ever-haunting question--is there real magic? Author Anne Ursu writes extremely well, in lucid and simple prose. She draws you in quickly and engages you so that you can't stop reading. The characters soon become real and you care what happens to them. Well, yes, it is a bit overdone at points, a bit too sentimental, but it works well. I recommend this one highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.	2003-04-06

Now she is about to throw it all over for a mad infatuation with Matthew, a younger man with piercing blue eyes. Living a double life with two men is not easy, but Dilys proves surprisingly adept as her life hurtles toward disaster.<br />That is the basic plot, complicated by layers of family conflict and the surprising revelations of her &quot;difficult&quot; elderly aunt Eliza, who turns up with her own tales of adulterous intrigue, and becomes Dilys' co-conspirator. So how does it turn out? Will Dilys leave Francis and all she holds dear to run off with Matthew? Will she come to her senses?

The motel is a dingy and depressing place, catering to transients and the down-and-out. Our narrator attends school and works at the motel and dreams of having his first sexual experience.<br />Not a novel of complex ideas but of sad and desperate yearnings. Things get worse when the young man's father has a stroke, and the little family is no longer able to maintain the business. What will happen to them now?<br />Despite its dreary theme, the book is endearingly funny, with snappy dialogue, and unexpected tragicomic scenes.

The story begins when he decides to get up early each morning, light a fire in the pitch-black darkness, and spend time in quiet reflection. And he does so through a whole box of matches--thirty-three matches--thirty-three frigid mornings, thirty-three delightful short chapters.<br />This is not a traditional novel with a plot. It is more like a journal, in which a man shares his inmost thoughts--small thoughts, anecdotes, observations about matches and fires and how to find things in the dark; and about his family, his troubled thoughts about his father, the children he dearly loves; his sense of time slipping away; his surprising discoveries about his pet duck... and so much more. It is the story of a man's life, not in chronologic order but as the network of meanings and experiences that life is made of.<br />So little seems to happen, so little seems to change from one day's musings to the next, that I would call this minimalist fiction.

Arthur and his twin brother Proctor live in the house where their adoptive sister Caroline raised them and then died, under strange circumstances, several years before. Trutor's assignment is to explore the mystery of Caroline, and to write her biography.<br />Sounds simple enough but, as Trutor discovers, Caroline was a complex and difficult woman, who has shrouded herself in layers of mystery, a room full of journals, complex victorian riddles, paintings, and a coded map that symbolizes her life.<br />Trutor quickly becomes immersed in this strange quest, and in Caroline's world, and as she does she also becomes part of the Whartons and their dysfunctional family. What happens? What does she learn about Caroline? What does she learn about herself? You will just have to read it and see!<br />Trutor is an exquisitely crafted book. The writing is lucid and poetic, the characters engaging and complex, the New England ambience is convincing, and the underlying message is powerful: Love has the power to redeem. This is not a totally easy book to read. It takes concentration, and you will probably take the time, as I did, to solve some of the riddles, which will cause you to put down the book and think.

On her thirtieth birthday Rich surprises her with their new home in the city-well, to be honest-in the slums. Their new home is what realtors would call a handyman special. In other words, barely fit to live in. Their new neighborhood is dingy and frightening, punctuated by the constant sounds of sirens and gunshots.<br />And so, reluctantly Cari follows her husband into this frightening new world, slowly adapts, meets her new neighbors, and forms relationships. And in the long, hard process of adapting she learns more about living than she would ever have suspected. Some wonderful and terrible things happen, and Cari grows up, really grows up. That is the story in a nutshell.<br />Living In The City is not an intricately plotted novel. There is little action. The book is a series of richly textured vignettes of Cari's life, emotions, and relationships. The author  paints these vignettes in beautiful, flowing prose, rich with sounds, tastes, colors and odors. I have rarely read a book that conveys such a remarkable sense of intimacy, of the inner experience of persons and relationships. If you like that kind of book you will love this one. It will have you laughing and crying.<br />Unfortunately this otherwise wonderful book suffers from a lack of editing. There are a number of grammatical slips, missing words, superfluous words.

The buttercup, that brilliant little yellow wildflower, is author Nancy Marie's metaphor for light, the reflected light of God that should be evident in a Christian's life. Talking about buttercups is her way of explaining the Christian walk, the spiritual journey that continues after salvation, \\"walking the talk.\\" This is the hard part of Christianity, the living it out day by day, with difficult people and stressful situations, and most of all, with oneself and all one's flaws.<br />Author Nancy Marie is a not only a spirit-filled Christian and devoted Christian writer, but also a serious student of Christianity. In this charming book she does not gloss over the difficulties of the Christian life, nor does she portray herself as one who has mastered it. The charm of the book is in her vulnerability, her willingness to share her own struggles and stumbles. And she does so freely and with humor.<br />Barely one hundred pages, this little book is packed with solid spiritual teaching, backed by extensive Biblical citations and Greek word studies. Thirteen concise chapters, with such catchy titles as \\"Getting To Know You\\" and \\"Be Careful What You Pray For\\" take the reader through the stages of spiritual formation, through the difficult steps of getting to know God, humility, mercy, compassion, forgiveness, and faith. The goal is always kept in sight: to let the light of God shine through you, to be a \\"buttercup for Jesus.\\" Easy to read about, difficult to apply.<br />The author's humility and her delightful sense of humor shine through every page. The writing is charming, lucid and colloquial. In fact, it is deceptively easy to read. This is a book that should be read more than once-first, for enjoyment; then, for serious study. Then perhaps, over the years, for devotions, for personal study, for group discussion.<br />Regrettably this wonderful book could have used a bit more editing. Occasional lapses of spelling, grammar and page layout detract from its delightful message. The author makes a practice of using \\"they\\" as a universal gender-neutral pronoun. Sometimes it works, but on occasion it leads to awkward turns of expression. Hopefully a future edition will see these rough edges polished away.<br />Still, this is a charming and inspired book.

Fortunately the best neurosurgeon in the country is available and agrees to take the case; unknown to Tyler's desperate father, Dr. Saramaggio is also involved in some--shall we say--questionable research.<br />The book starts with this premise, tells us a lot about the brain and about the frontiers of research, the possibility of rebuilding the brain with neural stem cells, but then veers off into metaphysics. Can the mind be somehow separated from the brain, extracted by a computer, exist somewhere outside of space and time? And would the world's greatest neurosurgeon do anything--anything--no matter how unethical, to pursue his unorthodox research and the glory that might go with it?<br />This should be a great book, and at moments it is.

He begins with love, work, belonging, moves on to the spiritual journey, the nature of self, the acceptance of aging, and the understanding of death. His concluding chapters, dealing with God, and bringing spirituality back home to its ground in religion, are like soaring towers, straining toward the light.

His writing is fluid and graceful, with a kindly sense of humor. He says little about himself, putting himself into the background, and so his presence is powerfully felt--a man of learning, integrity, wisdom and care for others.<br />This book, I'm afraid, is not for everyone.

That God took a tremendous risk in creation, and in giving us free will.

The protagonist really spends some time there. That is about the only connection this book has with reality as we know it. Somehow you don't mind, because, from page one, the author makes it clear that you are not traveling in ordinary reality. I like to think of the novel as a strange mixture of Kafka, the brilliant writer of  morbid frustrations; and Seinfeld, the show that was supposed to be about nothing.<br />Actually, it was about the trivia of daily life, seen in a new, totally mad, hilarious way. And so is Iceland. From Paul, the struggling typewriter repairman in a world of computers, to his  terminal disease which never kills him, to his failing organ that is never identified, to...well, it goes on and on. Rich with symbolism? Yes, but...often there is less than meets the eye. And that is exactly the point.<br />Iceland is a book about thinking too much, analyzing too much, reading too much into whimsical moments, the &quot;philosophy virus&quot; as Paul sometimes calls it. And so, it is a book that makes you think, and at the same time, laugh. This is a unique novel by a gifted, thoughtful, brilliantly insightful author. I think you will love it. Reviewed by Louis N.

Waay Over	Jim and Louella are a fifty-plus couple who experience an i-n-c-r-e-d-i-b-l-e sexual re-awakening, after Louella consults with her savvy female ancestors in a dream. The advice she gets is pretty much Masters and Johnson sex therapy, but does it work? Wow! Not only do they become the hottest couple in the neighborhood, they develop psychic powers! They can hear other people's thoughts, and so, they begin a healing ministry of love.<br />So far, so good. But as the story goes on it does begin to drag a bit. The dialect (\\"we just country folks\\") gets a little old, and the down-home, rambling chatter of Louella becomes almost  tiresome. Still, I enjoyed it and recommend it to you.<br />Not really a novel, more like a long short story, an extended parable about love and its power to change the human heart. Take it for what it is, a sentimental, mystical, romantic, spiritual  journey, and you will enjoy it. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber	2003-01-01

This short, compact novel was first published in 1976 in the U.K. and is now ((2002) reissued in the U.S. When it was first published the cold war was still going on, the Soviet Union seemed indestructible, and Yuri Andropov (remember him?)was head of the KGB. As the story opens the Soviets have grandiose ideas of pushing Britain into a virtual coup d'etat. All they need is a little more influence, a little more leverage on the British government, and they think they may have found it in Sir James Hoult, the British ambassador. The Soviet plan is essentially to seduce the (apparently) naive Hoult with a highly trained female operative, get him to compromise himself, and then use him to extract information and to plant pro-Soviet advice in the ear of the Prime Minister.<br />Of course nothing goes according to plan, the law of unintended consequences takes over, suspense grows as things spin out of control, taking you to a horrifying surprise ending.<br />Allbeury creates a believable story out of this essentially unbelievable situation, creates characters you can connect with, makes you care about them, draws you in until you can't put the book down. For the book is not really about geopolitics after all, but about flawed  individuals caught up in a mad system.<br />If you really think about the story, it is absurd; on the other hand, it is gripping and most entertaining. And although the book is only twenty-six years old it already has a quaint aura of fading history. I think you will love it, comrade. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber	2002-12-29

He will be working, in some nebulous sense, for the famous writer Rupert Grant. In actuality he will become an acolyte to a troubled, self-absorbed, aging man and his entourage. He will struggle to make sense of the complex, unconventional, and ever-shifting relationships in that strange household. And he will make some terrible, regrettable mistakes.<br />While the other reviewers have praised this book, I found it somewhat disappointing, a pretentious \\"literary\\" novel about pretentious literary people. The story is told by Alex in stream-of-consciousness fashion, with interminable commentary on the meaning of everything that is said and done. Underlying the literary pretension of the book is an ever-present layer of amateurish freudianalysis, of the kind that was once popular among educated people. Everything, of course, means something else. The language is lush and colorful, with vivid descriptions of the island and people, but alas, too many names dropped, too many literary allusions, too many unexplained Italian phrases.<br />In refreshing contrast are the letters of the late brother, Nicky, read and re-read by Alex, written in vulgar, down-to-earth, gritty language. These letters, and in a sense, Nicky himself, become an anchor to reality for the troubled Alex.<br />Will Alex find himself? Will he come to understand what is real and what is pretentious nonsense? Will he ever form a responsible adult relationship with anyone else? I won't spoil it for you. I will only say that a lot of pain and disappointment lie behind the frothy literary discussions. A good book but not for everyone and not always easy reading. I thought it could have been better done.	2002-12-24

If you have any sense at all you won't go up there, especially during the full moon, because--well--children have disappeared up there and never been seen again. Well, of course you don't have enough sense to stay out of there, even though you know better, if the girl you're sweet on is going up there with another boy, older and more aggressive and--you're going up there, wanted or not. And so begins a long, rambling adventure that takes you through many dangerous and frightening situations, and introduces you to many wise and helpful friends.<br />How does it end? I won't tell you, of course. But I can say that the story isn't really about space aliens. It's about courage and character and loyalty, and about the wisdom of old timers, and about how you become a grownup. The book has its flaws. It rambles a bit. It gets overly sentimental at times.

Into this dismal picture comes news that Frank's father (actually stepfather, actually his uncle, Ward), has been killed. Frank has fantasies of going back and claiming his share of the family farm; maybe even unraveling his tortured past, sorting out what really happened when his parents were mysteriously killed in a fire many years before.<br />Of course there are many complications between low life in New Jersey and new life in the upper peninsula of Michigan.

Confusion, irritability, conflicts about intimacy, a night of wild lovemaking with his housekeeper, terrible guilt, questions about his vocation, and finally his decision to renounce the priesthood.<br />It could have been a great story, but it left me disappointed.

A little girl and her baby brother are suddenly ripped from a life of ease and safety and thrust into a life-long adventure, fleeing for their lives in a world gone mad. Lawlessness and social disintegration run rampant, hard on the heels of pervasive drought which will soon make their world uninhabitable. The story takes place far in the future, in a continent called Ifrik (Africa), at a time when our present civilization is buried beneath a new ice age.<br />How will the brother and sister survive? How will they change? What is the meaning behind their incredible adventures? As they move slowly and painfully north, from one disastrous situation to another, North becomes a metaphor for everyone's search--the place where things will somehow be better. The place where life will have meaning. As always, Lessing is creating more than an adventure; it is also a commentary on the human condition, on the rise and fall of civilization, on the desperate human wish to ignore bad news and cling to a comfortable present, on the thoughtless destruction of the environment, on meaningless cruelty, on tribalism, on hope and hopelessness.<br />It takes a little effort to get started, to travel this hot, dry, dusty road with Mara and Dann, but the adventure soon takes hold of you and draws you onward. You also have to go North. This book is a masterpiece.	2002-11-16

The outlines of the plot have been given by other reviewers. The novel is actually a collection of short stories nested within other stories, stories of loss, betrayal, unforgiveable actions, atonement, and grasping for redemption. Many of the stories are unbelievable, shocking, even repulsive, yet somehow the author weaves them together so skillfully, so artfully, that you will want to keep on reading.<br />The unifying theme, played out through the mythic narrator, author David Zimmer, and the mythic cinematographer Hector Mann, is this: What do we leave behind? Do we leave anything behind? Or is it all illusion? The real author, Paul Auster, is a master of illusion, who can weave illusion and reality together seamlessly. Somehow it all becomes believable.<br />I enjoyed the book and found it hard to put down, although it did drag some near the end.

The story is told in a rather unusual style--bits of correspondence, excerpts from interviews, newspaper headlines. There are no scenes, no dialogue. Adding an extra dimension the author supplies the actual art works of Baker--which, if not works of genius, are certainly striking.<br />Oddly enough, it all works!

Is Miller really at the focal point of a malign conspiracy? Or is he slowly going psychotic? The author circles around his characters and situations, peeling away layer after layer, revealing unsuspected depths of misery.  Miller is more than a college professor going through a bad patch; he is a strangely oblivious man, a man who misunderstands social cues in a radical and frightening way, a man who seems oblivious to the wreckage he creates in those who try to relate to him. But is he more than this, maybe even a killer? Well, let the reader decide.<br />Author James Lasdun is a master of surrealistic prose, written in a disarmingly lucid and simple way.

Will they ever work things out? What will it cost them? For beneath the surface of this love story the author is asking a deeper question. What is the meaning of love itself? The love of God or the love of men and women. What is it really? What is its cost? The novel is never preachy, but a deep religious consciousness lies just below the surface. Real love is more than ecstatic emotion, it says; it is faithfulness, constancy, washing dishes, picking up the child from daycare, sitting quietly with the one you love without saying a word, no matter how much it may hurt.<br />You will laugh, you will cry, you will blow your nose a few times.

If he had lived today he would undoubtedly be a frequent guest on talk shows. Now after many years of obscurity, Casanova has had a revival of sorts, and a following of scholars known as \\"casanovists.\\"<br />Andrei Codrescu's book, based loosely on the facts of Casanova's life, details the  declining years of Casanova, against the backdrop of European history. It is a time of spectacular decadence, the last days of a crumbling feudal aristocracy, the shock waves of the French revolution, and the personal decline of the once notorious Casanova, a man who has had many romantic escapades but has never formed a lasting relationship with a woman. Now he is lonely, disillusioned, desperately trying to achieve immortality through his writings. And in a way, as the author shows, he does.<br />I love listening to Andrei Codrescu on National Public Radio, but Casanova in Bohemia was something of a letdown.

Their meetings and their partings are heavy with beauty and sadness.<br />This is a most beautiful book and I recommend it highly.	2002-09-03

This is a most amazing book, beginning with the premise that Alice White, a beautiful and talented young lady, turns into a wolf once a month like clockwork. Naturally this complicates her life and forces her into a lonely existence of superficial relationships. That is, until she meets Erik, her college course advisor, and against her better judgment, falls deeply in love with him. He is the first man she has ever loved, but what will he say when she tells him the lycanthropic truth? This is a love story that really gets complicated. And Erik's ex-wife Debra is trying to win him back. And her psychiatrist, who secretly lusts for her,  is making things even more difficult.<br />Well, this was a book I could not put down. It is well written, wise and insightful. Danvers makes the strange premise of the book somehow believable. You begin to wonder--well, what if? After all, don't we all have an animal nature, a dark side that we scarcely know? The only part of the book I found hard to believe was the unprofessional behavior of the psychiatrist.<br />So, run out to the woods and howl--no, no--buy this book and read it, nooooooow!	2002-08-25

Mike Daisey, self-styled \\"slacker\\" and \\"dilettante\\" finds himself forced to accept his first real job--guess where?--at our favorite company, amazon.com. And according to him it was a disaster. He loves the excitement of the company, he loves Jeff Bezos, he drives his family nuts with amazon[.com] slogans and mantras, but he is a lousy employee. He may have been the worst customer service rep in the company's short history. See, he doesn't like work and so, mostly, he doesn't do any. And as he tells us about his misadventures he makes fun of everything that happened. The company, the dot-com bubble, the fellow employees, and mostly--himself.<br />And that is what makes the book funny, and not just silly. Mike is a man who can laugh deeply at himself. And as he laughed at himself and built his shortcomings to unbelievable proportions, he had me laughing with him. I haven't laughed this hard in years. Mike is the Dave Barry of dot-com. And, in spite of his total ineptitude in customer service he is a man you want to like, a man with heart, a man who has a good woman who stays with him and keeps him grounded.<br />Now, in his post-corporate incarnation, Mike is doing performance art and his book is ranked no. 1967 (today) on amazon.com. Not bad for a slacker. Buy this book today and laugh your head off!	2002-08-24

Even for the characters. The entire book is a sex scene, during which the partners go off into their separate thoughts, about their loneliness, emptiness, off-again, on-again relationship, betrayals, sexual adventures, promiscuity, dishonesty, etc., etc. Ben,the male partner, is kind of waiting for this to be over because he has a date with his other girlfriend, and he is finding it hard to build up to the necessary excitement. Kay is kind of lost in the experience, thinking of it as a kind of \\"worship.\\" Both participants are thirty-something, unattached, glamorous but empty individuals, unable to make lasting commitments. There is no growth or change in this book, nothing is learned, nothing gained. Susan Minot is a very talented writer and carries this off well, but--why?	2002-08-20

Only, in this alternate reality, it is called St. Lucius and there is no United States of America. The Romans had a high tech civilization 2000 years ago but were banished to outer space. The Holy Catholic Church (not Roman) is a vast and ruthless bureacracy (well, yeah) which runs most of the world on behalf of the Benefactors, who claim to be &quot;the Heavenly Host&quot; but are actually shape-changing aliens from a different part of the galaxy. Studying Latin is a capital crime and ten cents is a large sum of money. And there's more, much more. The author's imagination is fertile indeed. Still, at heart, this is a rip-roaring cosmic adventure story in which one beleaguered man (and a few faithful cohorts) must save the world.<br />The characters are interesting and they grow during the course of the story. The action moves right along. The conflicts are gripping. And our guys still have that American can-do spirit and ingenuity.<br />Sometimes the plot doesn't totally hang together, the science is pretty thin (it's really fantasy with gadgets more than science fiction) and the Latin grammar is a little weak at times (Well, hey, the Romans are still speaking Latin!). All in all, a great read, hard to put down.	2002-08-18

In his pocket he carries a watch which is actually a time machine. That's the science-fiction aspect of the book. The rest is philosophy, a deep examination of choice and free will and what makes a person really free. Time-travel of course is loaded with paradox, as all sci-fi readers know. To visit the past (or the future) is to change it irrevocably. Kropotkin's time travel starts out as a lark, like Rip Van Winkle waking up in a new time, meeting some cool characters, finding a girlfriend, learning a new culture. But soon more people from the past are turning up. The lark begins branching off into a number of alternative futures, not all pleasant. Things start to get messy. The last third of the book turns very dark, as our  hero learns that escape is not freedom and  that choices may be painful but necessary. To time-travel out of slavery in Virginia may be easy. To escape from oneself, maybe not. There is so much packed into this book that I cannot truly say I  understood it all. It was profound, yet at the same gracefully written, lucid, easy to follow, and often hilarious. I recommend it.	2002-08-16

It is a time when the aboriginal culture is rapidly being decimated by well-meaning but oppressive whites. The little girl is shipped off to a cruel Catholic boarding school. The little boy is shuffled here and there but  eventually ends up in America, with an adoptive family who treat him with unbelievable insensitivity. Ultimately he finds himself imprisoned on death row.<br />The struggles of the two children are portrayed with clear, lucid prose in the first half of the book, a tale of great sadness and pain. In the second half, Beatrice, the girl, runs off in search of her ancestral roots, and finds  The Real People, a handful of aboriginies who still live in the bush and are trying to maintain the old ways. Unfortunately this part of the book is not believable. The characters are one-dimensional, too, too good; and their coversation consists of long speeches full of new age jargon. The language they use is totally out of character with  the simple people they are supposed to be. The author describes a utopian society of people with great wisdom and psychic powers, set against the cruel, intolerant and bigoted white society.<br />At the conclusion of the book, brother and sister are reunited, at least make contact, and she leaves him with a document that tries to summarize all the wisdom she has learned from the Real People.<br />In fact, some of it is good. The author has some wisdom to share and it is indeed uplifting. But it is not written in a believable and coherent way. Does any of this really come from Australian aboriginal culture? Or is this Celestine Prophecy Down Under? Hard to say. The presentation is just too one-sided, too slanted, to be really convincing.	2002-08-11

The laboratory had been working in nuclear weapons research but with the end of the cold war it must find new missions to justify itself and keep the funding coming. The physicists who work there find themselves getting away from science and into politics and becoming more and more disillusioned. Every day they have to fight their way through protestors to get to work. And the protestors also find themselves disillusioned, getting nowhere. That is the plot in a nutshell. But the author executes it with intensity, energy, and a painful probing of the human spirit.<br />Scholtz has a remarkable style--a kind of acoustic reality, I would call it--in which conversations are reported exactly as they sound, without quotation marks, words broken off, sentences broken off, hard to tell who is talking. The effect is like wandering into a large crowd of people and being inundated with fragments of speech. It is like actually being in the story as opposed to being told the story.<br />I must say this was not an easy book to read, and I would not like to read a book of this intensity very often. Nor is there a happy ending to lighten things up. The characters are complex but dark, idealists who have lost hope in their ideals, searching frantically for something (or someone)to believe in, but never finding. A dark, painful, difficult book, but well worth reading!	2002-08-06

Small groups of dedicated Jewish traditionalists are even now working toward the possible rebuilding of the ancient temple in Jerusalem and the restoration of traditional sacrifical worship. They are busily reconstructing temple artifacts, musical instruments and priestly vestments, and they are training young men to become future priests. Of course this would become an explosive issue in Jewish-Muslim relations, politically almost unthinkable. In Traylor's novel, this core of reality is extrapolated into an amazing fantasy. Zachary Cohen has been identified as the one living person  qualified to be the new High Priest. Certain ancient relics must be found, however, before he can actually be installed to the High Priesthood--such as the ephod or breastplate, the ashes of the red heifer, and the mysterious urim and thummim--the oracle of biblical times. Somehow all these relics have survived, hidden mysteriously in various far-flung points and the adventurers of the novel set out on a fast-paced search for them.<br />This could have made a great tale, but there are some serious drawbacks. Most of the characters are one-sided and not that believable. The adventurers never encounter any real danger. Everything turns out as they would have desired and much too easily. And Mr. Cohen, the designated High Priest, turns out to be a believer in Jesus, a Messianic Jew. Which, oddly enough, turns out to be a fairly minor problem. The author has injected into the story her own religious belief/aspiration/wish that the Jewish nation is about to accept Christ as its savior, not to mention the fact that the royal house of Jordan is going to assist and that friendship is about to break out all over. Just too many unbelievable things happening too fast, and credulity is stretched to the limit and beyond.<br />The book is poorly edited, with awkward dialogue, and with phrases such as \\"fair-complected,\\" \\"elderly gents,\\" \\"yuppie-looking\\" and \\"sneerd.\\" The author spins an interesting yarn and it's not hard to read, but it could have been so much better done.and it's not hard to read, but it could have been so much better done.	2002-07-31

Well, No.	This book is not quite as bad as some of the other reviewers have indicated. It's readable and moves right along. A great book if you have time to kill. Unfortunately, it's also silly and shallow. Augustus McKnight is just about to quit his \\"day job\\" and became a \\"Day Trader\\" when his wife announces she is leaving him. The next day she is found murdered. Augustus' life is rapidly spiralling down hill. Assorted \\"friends\\" and \\"co-workers\\" seem united in trying to do him in. Nobody is who they seem to be. Augustus becomes an amateur sleuth, trying to solve the case of his wife's murder in which he is rapidly becoming the chief suspect. The plot is complicated and contrived, the characters are not believable, nor do you care what happens to them. And the main character, the protagonist (who is also the narrator, who also gives tedious lectures about the mechanics of selling short, for example) is--how shall I say it?--a jerk. This is not a financial thriller at all, really, although Augustus is supposedly \\"day trading.\\" It is just a second-rate whodunit. But as I say, it reads quickly, and is kind of fun.	2002-07-22

I don't usually read legal thrillers, but in this case the title got me hooked. And it turns out this goes way beyond an up-and- coming lawyer on his way to making partner. Will Riordan is no longer introduced to us than he is enmeshed in two strange cases. An intense black woman (rape victim), a little unbalanced, sends him a barrage of stream-of-consciousness e-mails about the meaning of victimhood; the murder suspect he is defending is malevolent and undoubtedly guilty. Will's marriage is falling apart as we watch, and he is questioning the meaning and purpose of life. The dialogue is crisp and snappy, sometimes unbearably funny, while the characters struggle with emptiness and play legal games, office games, power games. And at the same time there is a strange goodness in the story. There is the hope of redemption. There is meaning to life after all. The story moves quickly; the writing is exquisite, poetical, sometimes vulgar and always believable. And, for me at least, this was not a book I \\"could not put down.\\" You see, I had to put it down sometimes, to rest, to regroup. It was too intense to read straight through. It is a wonderful book and I recommend it highly!	2002-07-20

It begins as an allegorical tale about nameless people who come to worship &quot;the kingdom&quot; with its rules and power structure, more than &quot;the King,&quot; which we soon learn, is Jesus. Then the story seems to become barely fictionalized autobiography. &quot;Francis&quot; is a former priest who is now world-famous for his writings and teachings about Jesus, yet many in the church despise him, particularly those in the church power structure. The message is basically the same as that in the Joshua books--Jesus came to set us free from mindless rules and regulations, so that we would learn to love one another. But in this book the messenger is not Jesus, but (apparently) Girzone, fighting against a heartless church establishment. The writing is not polished, sometimes repetitive, and it wanders unpredictably between history and allegory. A good editor could have made the book more consistent and more coherent. I enjoyed the book, and it's easy enough reading, but not of the same quality as the Joshua books.	2002-07-09

People have been burned at the stake for saying a lot less than the good bishop. His is a radical but tightly reasoned scholarship which sweeps you along with him, like it or not. He begins with what should be obvious--the gospels are Jewish books, written by Jewish believers for other Jewish believers, at a time when the church was still a largely Jewish community. He presents the fascinating thesis that the Gospels were never written as--never meant to be--eyewitness accounts, but midrashic stories meant for use in the developing Christian liturgy. By this word--midrashic--he refers to a kind of Jewish teaching story, in which legendary accounts are used to convey deep spiritual truths. A story about Abraham and his father, for example. Or, what did Abraham tell Sarah after he returned from the \\"sacrifice\\" of Isaac. No one expects these stories to be factual accounts, that is not their purpose. Spong has done his homework and he draws the reader through a meticulous accounting of how the Gospel stories were constructed out of biblical (i.e. Old Testament) materials, to form a cycle of readings for the Jewish liturgical year. Along the way he shows how the developing rift between the young Jewish church and orthodox Judaism affected successive New Testament writers and laid the groundwork for centuries of bitter prejudice against the Jews.<br />  Spong takes the same sharp knife to all the Gospel materials--the birth stories, Joseph, Judas, the passion, the crucifixion, and the resurrection. When he is finished there is not much left of the literal Gospel record. Not much that can be thought of as eyewitness accounts or factual history.<br />  Yet he remains deeply spiritual, deeply convinced that someone named Jesus lived and taught and transformed people, set people free, lives among us still. Only he can't be captured in literal-minded thinking.<br />  This is a disturbing book, and for some people it will be extremely threatening, but it is well worth reading.is a disturbing book, and for some people it will be extremely threatening, but it is well worth reading.	2002-07-07

She is, to say the least, emotionally disturbed. Unpredictable mood swings, impulsive, using drugs, takes unbelievable risks. Drags Michael into an ever thickening plot, a murder, shenanigans involving the highest levels of the White House--what more could you ask? Unfortunately the ever thickening plot is hard to follow, the characters are not believeable, the dialogue is nothing but snappy comebacks, shouting, nobody listening. There is a lot of running and hiding. The book starts off with a bang, but by the middle of the 479 pages I had to force myself to keep reading. Toward the end the pace picks up again, racing toward a slam-bang finish which feels artificial and contrived. Michael has miraculously escaped with his life and won't be going to prison, but, has he learned anything? Doubtful. This White House adventure was a big disappointment.	2002-07-04

Craig Nova explores this (not entirely original) theme with grace and power in Wetware.

It was wonderful. He begins with the concept of the anawim, the poor and humble ones who are actually God's chosen remnant. Tracing this concept through the Old Testament, and especially the Psalms, he illustrates it in the life and teachings of Jesus. The anawim, God's chosen, are always opposed by the proud and the self-righteous. He explains the beatitudes in this light in beautiful and lucid writing, as he explores each beatitude and shows the commonality between them. Now, this is not a completely easy book, hence the four stars, because his style is circular and repetitious, more like prayer or  meditation than scholarly exposition. So I often found it necessary to re-read his words several times in order to grasp his line of thought clearly. It was definitely worth the effort.

The book begins as the diary of a young boy in Victorian England, we are not told his exact age, and his irreverent observations of life. And as it happens, this boy can see and converse with folks who have died, and can see auras. This part of the book is believable and funny. The Victorian era British slang is a hoot, and the social pretensions and inhibited language of the grownups is absolutely fascinating. But then, some other aspects of the book take the edge off. First the anonymous &quot;diarist,&quot; now grown up, comes in with annotations and corrections, no longer humorous. Spirit visitors give long dissertations about spiritualism (the belief that the dead can communicate with the living) in turgid, unintelligible prose. The funny little boy becomes a directionless man who spends his time traveling alone, for no apparent reason. And the man who brought it all together, Cyril Scott, adds his own layer of editorializing and promoting spiritualism. Concepts from theosophy are added in and terms like &quot;lords of karma&quot; are freely thrown around. The book is great and I enjoyed it, but it does have this other side that is not quite so appealing.	2002-02-06

It might have been easy in the monastery kitchen, but then, Brother Lawrence didn't carry a pager or cell-phone, didn't have to deal with difficult people in a vast bureaucracy. It all began to seem rather hopeless until I came across one of his maxims, near the end of the book. Even during meditation or prayer, he says, &quot;whilst our voice is rising in prayer, we ought to cease for one brief moment, as often as we can, to worship God in the depth of our being...&quot; Then it all began to make sense.

He begins with a spunky ten-year old &quot;Sarai&quot; and her bratty sister &quot;Qira&quot; who will later turn out, interestingly, to be Mrs. Lot. Card takes a number of liberties with the biblical story, but he has done prodigious research, and is able to make those almost prehistoric times, customs and peoples believable. I enjoyed the book and recommend it, but it has some limitations. The characters are one-dimensional and they never seem to grow or change. I was disappointed in the portrayal of Abraham's relationship to God--it was unique and unheard of for his time, not just another religious guy. Still and all, the book was most enjoyable and easy to read!	2002-01-27

The author starts with some simple premises of the Star Trek genre and proceeds to weave a story that is entertaining, fast moving, running over with wit and humor. Her characters are interesting, too. She knows people. The only problem with Anomaly Adventures is that it  reads too fast. I tried to pace myself so it would last longer, but I  couldn't.	2000-04-30
