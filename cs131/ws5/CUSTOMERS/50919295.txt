Famously, bare electric light bulbs were within inches of one stack of books which was piled almost to the ceiling.  I had occasion to see \\"behind the stacks\\" of the Science and Technology department one day, in the area where patent information was stored, and I was shocked:  material was stacked on top of every bookcase in sight, and the place was packed with heaps of books and documents, many of which were destroyed in the 1986 fire. <br /> <br />The Los Angeles City Council was well aware that the central library was a fire trap, but they refused to do anything to upgrade the library facility.  Then-Mayor Tom Bradley preferred using City tax money to finance his jet-setting lifestyle of junket after junket to the Far East rather than spend money to bring the Central Library up to even the bare minimums of the Fire Code.  The consensus among critics was that the City Council and the Mayor were waiting for the Central Library to burn down so that their campaign contributors could cash in on the building contracts which would be awarded after the inevitable fire.   <br /> <br />As it turned out, thefire was a huge windfall for the real estate developers and building contractors who bankrolled our last Mayor, for the City financed the new structure by selling off the air space above it to real estate developers who then applied the \\"space\\" they had purchased to erect skyscrapers around the new library to heights which would have been prohibited had the new library not been built.  The result was a glut of office space, much of which went empty for a decade or more, and a skyline which no longer included either City Hall or the Central Library, formerly the tallest buildings in their neighborhoods by municipal ordinance.  In 2004 it was revealed that the new skyline also made the neighborhood of the new Central Library the #1 target of al-Qaeda in Southern California, ahead of even Disneyland -- a fact which the City and the falsely so-called \\"Department of Homeland Security\\" kept secret from the residents and businesses of Los Angeles for three years. <br />  <br />Basbanes was not writing a political diatribe, but I think he did  the readers of this book a grave dis-service by allowing them to think that a lone arsonist was solely responsible for the disaster which was the 1986 fire.  Tom Bradley and the City Council deserve the blame for creating the conditions which turned a small fire into a hectacomb of books which destroyed a gem of Art Deco architecture.  Basbanes quotes Lawrence Clark Powell, former librarian of UCLA, to the effect that the building itself was insignificant.  On the contrary, the interior was covered with murals and much statuary and other art graced the building -- much of it totally lost now. <br /> <br />If such compelling information is omitted from the discussion of a library with which I am very familiar, I wonder how much crucial information has been left out of sections about libraries with which I am unfamiliar. <br />  <br />Basbanes cannot be faulted for omitting mention of the scandal which has destroyed the reputation of the Biblioteca Alexandrina, to which he devotes the epilogue of \\"Patience & Fortitude\\" -- the events took place two years after the first edition of this book was published.  One hopes that future editions will devote considerable space to the scandal. <br />  <br />How unexpected the shocking story turned out is demonstrated by the fact that it happened less than a month after Umberto Eco, whom Basbanes interviewed, gave a speech at the BA.  The timing was ironic, for the scandal hinged upon a book which Eco had discussed at length in \\"Foucault's Pendulum,\\" which prompted him to lead the international crusade against the institution which had played host to him so recently.  <br />  <br />In December 2003, less than a month after Eco's speech there, the Biblioteca Alexandrina launched a prominent exhibit of \\"Monotheism,\\" and the book which they choose to place alongside the Hebrew Talmud was not the Septuagint -- the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures, which had been written in Alexandria -- but \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\\" <br />  <br />For those unfamiliar with it, \\"The Protocols\\" is, as Eco had pointed out years earlier in \\"Foucault's Pendulum,\\" an anti-Jewish Tsarist secret police forgery purportedly containing the details of a plot by \\"the Learned Elders of Zion\\" to conquer the world.  The book fueled Russian pogroms and Nazi genocide of the Jews, and today it is used by neo-Nazi and radical Moslems alike to stoke hatred of the Jews.  As an anti-Jewish book it is sold by neo-Nazi groups in the 21st century and is a best seller in Moslem countries, helped in no small part by the authority of the Biblioteca Alexandrina. <br />  <br />What makes the display of the \\"The Protocols\\" such an outrage is that there is no longer any question that the book is a total fabrication.  Not only was it a Russian forgery, but it was an almost word-for-word copy of a 19th century German plagiarism of a French novel satirizing Napoleon III and the Second Empire.Its roots may be traced to a novel by French Author Eugene Sue, who outlined a *Jesuit* plot to take over the world.  The evidence of this is incontovertible -- today's text of \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" is a \\"Jewified\\" version of 19th century French novels which originally made no mention of Jews, Zionists or otherwise.  <br />  <br />Nevertheless, the Biblioteca Alexandrina chose to display \\"The Protocols\\" next to the Talmud, and no amount of back-pedaling by director Yousef Ziedan changes the fact that more than $100 million of international funding was ultimately used to propagate a hateful anti-Jewish forgery as a legitimate \\"religious\\" text of Judaism ([...] <br /> <br />Basbanes ends the first edition of \\"Patience & Fortitude\\" on the hopeful note that, \\"the Biblioteca Alexandrina ... has the promise of genius.\\"  Sadly, it proved its moral bankruptcy less than two years after this book was published.  Basbanes owes it to the world to write a revision of \\"Patience & Fortitude\\" describing how the high hopes which so many of us had for the \\"the new 'Library of Alexandria'\\" were utterly dashed. <br /> <br />I give this book only four stars because I am know that Basbanes omitted information which I think he should have revealed, and I suspect that he did it more than once.  If future editions fail to discuss the scandal at the Biblioteca Alexandrina my opinion of the book will plummet.	2005-07-15
US	50919295	R3TQ02HG7RWXON	078691985X	714088054	Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal (Forgotten Realms)	Books	2	28	34	N	N	Terrific theme -- amateurish writing -- BAD editing	This novel is the third in a trilogy based (loosely some say!) on the Balder's Gate computer games.  The plot is: the god Bhaal, of the Forgotten Realms D&D game setting, the deity of murder, spawned hundreds of children of various species (polymorphing himself as necessary) before he was killed; a decade on, they are now adults and adolescents and his former high priestess, the Chosen of Bhaal, has gathered together five of the most powerful \\"Bhaalspawn\\" (\\"the Five\\") in a plot to slaughter all of the others, releasing what fragments of \\"the essence of Bhaal\\" were contained within them.  The Chosen's goal is the rebirth of Bhaal from the re-asssembled bits o' Bhaal.  The goal of the Five is to suck up Bhaal essence from their half-sibs and become super-villains. <br />  <br />The novel opens with Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian, around whom the trilogy revolves, travelling through a forest with his half-sister (from whom he sucked out the Bhaal juice in one of the earlier books) and his lover WHO IS A BEAUTIFUL HALF-ELF.  We know that she is a HALF-ELF and BEAUTIFUL because author Karpyshyn *tells us* that she is -- often.  Abdel Adrian is BIG AND STRONG AND MUSCULAR; we know this because author Karpyshyn tells us that he is every second page or so.  He is also INVULNERABLE TO MELEE ATTACKS; we know this because Karpyshyn tells us ... constantly, apparently believing that anyone who would read this book must be doing so only because it is named after a video game and must therefore suffer from such severe Attention Defecit Disorder that if something is not repeated at least twice in every three pages the reader will forget it.  Did I mention that Abdel Is BIG AND STRONG AND MUSCULAR?  Because he is.  And his girlfriend is a BEAUTIFUL HALF-ELF.  Who loves him despite his being a Bhaalspawn and prone to suddenly turning into a four-armed bug which is twelve feet tall and prone to quoting Kafka.  The bug, called The Ravager, is BIG AND STRONG AND MUSCULAR and delights in slaughter, which is awkward for Abdel's half-sister and his girlfriend (who is a BEUTIFUL HALF-ELF, by the way). <br />  <br />BIG, STRONG, MUSCULAR Abdel, his half-sister and Abdel's BEAUTIFUL HALF-ELF girlfriend are attacked by one of the Five, who is killed within four pages, so don't worry about her name.  She uses rune-inscribed arrows to shoot Abdel's BIG, MUSCULAR, STRONG body, causing wounds which don't heal.  This surprises him, because his body HEALS ITS OWN DAMAGE (we know this because Karpyshyn tells us at least four times in every single chapter).  Surprised that the arrows prevent his BIG, STRONG, MUSCULAR BODY from HEALING ITS OWN DAMAGE, Abdel goes to some nether plane and there meets his dead half-brother -- another Bhaalspawn, whom he had killed in Book 1 or 2 -- and lets him have some Bhaal juice, which makes him come back to life. This half-brother, Sarevok, is an essential character because Abdel is as stupid as a brick and couldn't figure out that when you are in a nether plane in which *nothing* exists except for five doors hanging in mid-nothingness, the way to get home is to click your heels and say ... I mean, the way to get home is to OPEN A FRIGGIN' DOOR WHICH HAS YOUR HOME ON THE OTHER SIDE AND STEP THROUGH.  Sarevok, who wears BLADED ARMOR -- which has BLADES on it, don't forget, because those BLADES will be important later on! -- tells his BIG, STRONG, MUSCULAR half-brother to open the door which has the big neon sign reading \\"THIS WAY TO THE FOREST WHERE YOUR HALF-SISTER AND BEUATIFUL HALF-ELF GIRLFRIEND ARE LOOKING FOR YOU,\\" and there is the forest where his half-sister and BEAUTIFUL HALF-ELF girlfriend are wondering where his BIG, STRONG, MUSCULAR BODY (which HEALS ITS OWN DAMAGE, remember) has got to!  What a surprise!  (Bet you didn't see *that one* coming from five pages earlier!)  The four of them then go to Saradush, where lots of Bhaalspawn are gathered.   <br />  <br />Saradush is under siege, but they manage to walk through a sewer outflow and enter the city.  The sewer is large enough for Sarevok, who wears BLADED ARMOR and Abdel, who is BIG AND STRONG AND MUSCULAR (and seven feet tall, by the way) to walk through with no problem.  Twenty thousand besieging soldiers failed to notice this open grate in the wall at any time in the past six months, presumably because Karpyshyn didn't write up a neon sign for it, saying, \\"THIS WAY TO THE SECRET ENTRANCE!!!  BHAALSPAWN!  BHAALSPAWN! BHAALSPAWN!\\" <br />  <br />Sarevok, in his BLADED ARMOR and Abdel, with his BIG, STRONG, MUSCULAR BODY, and their half-sister, and Abdel's girlfriend, the BEAUTIFUL HALF-ELF, are immediately caputured by the defenders, who seem to have forgotten that there was an eight-foot wide hole in the city wall, and blah, blah, blah, they meet Melisaan, who was the one who gathered hundreds of Bhaalspawn here \\"for their own safety.\\"  (If you haven't already figured out who the Chosen of Bhaal is by this point in the novel, don't worry, you're no more stupid than the characters.) <br />  <br />Abdel is sent out to fight the besieging general, who is EVEN MORE BIGGER AND STRONGERER AND MORE MUSCULARARERER THAN ABDEL and whose WOUNDS ALSO HEAL THEMSELVES.  The latter surprises Abdel, who, being slightly more a dullard than George of the Jungle, was not quick to realize that a guy who is nine feet tall and EVEN MORE BIGGER AND STRONGERER AND MORE MUSCULARARERER THAN HE, and who goes half-naked into battle against a seven foot tall BIG AND STRONG AND MUSCULAR BHAALSPAWN who can turn into A FOUR ARMED, 12-FOOT TALL BUG could *also* HEAL HIS OWN WOUNDS -- doh!   (Don't forget that Abdel's girlfriend is a BEAUTIFUL HALF-ELF -- not that it matters much at this point.) <br />  <br />  <br />Abdel wins.  Did I mention that the enemy general, who was EVEN MORE BIGGER AND STRONGERER AND MORE MUSCULARARERER THAN ABDEL, had a rune-inscribed axe, too?  This surprises Abdel.  It surprises him so much that he leaves it lying on the ground and walks away from it despite the fact that many bad things still exist in the world and want to kill him and his half-sister and kill (re-kill?) his half-brother (who wears BLADED ARMOR, don't forget), and these rune-weapons are the only things which can wound BIG AND STRONG AND MUSCULAR BHAALSPAWN who HEAL THEIR OWN WOUNDS. <br />  <br />Then ... oh, God.  Why bother telling more?  There are dragons, who seem to exist only to be killed for experience points, being invulnerable before twenty thousand soldiers but dropping life gnats when fighting twelve-on-one against some schmuck in BLADED ARMOR who has no weapon but his BLADED ARMOR, and there are still more of the Five (three more, in fact!), and a mysterious monastery with a bad abbot and blah, blah, blah. <br />  <br />This book reads like a first draft penned by a bright twelve-year-old -- someone who can put together a good story but who does not yet know how to write it well.  When a writer with a good story and an execrable writing style submits material to a publisher, it is the responsibility of an editor to either fix the problems or else send the manuscript back to the author and tell him to rewrite it and keep rewriting until people like me won't be tempted to write reviews like this.  Obviously no one at Wizards of the Coast bothered to do this.  No *competent* editor would have allowed such sloppy, amateurish writing as this to hit the stands.  Those who have played the game have complained here about the book failing to mention huge amounts of the material which is covered by the game.  Had the book an editor who was even passably competent, at least one-eighth of it (which consisted of telling us that Abdel was BIG AND STRONG, etc., that his girlfriend was a BEAUTIFUL HALF-ELF, that his brother wore BLADED ARMORER, etc.) could have been cut and replaced with new information.  That this was not done is entirely the fault of The slap-dash editorial policy of Wizards of the Coast, whose parent company, Hasbro, apparently thinks that, \\"If you publish it, they will buy it.\\"  Not this dreck! <br />  <br />What is most galling about this lousy writing and editing is that there *is* an exciting, ripping yarn to be told about this chapter of Faerun's recent history.  Except for Gregor Samsa -- er, Abdel Adrian --turning into a twelve foot bug just before the end, the last couple of chapters in this novel are very good (albeit somewhat flawed), and *I* honestly did not know who would win in the end.  One character makes a surprising revelation which elicits a major shift in sympathy from one character to another and leaves Bhaal's plan to be reborn through his children in doubt -- up until the last couple of pages the outcome is uncertain, and not in a phoney, mock-suspense way, either -- there really is no certainty of who will win in the last two chapters. <br />  <br />This uncertainty is dashed by the most obnoxious character in the entire book, an angel (for want of a term recognizable to non-gamers) who works for Ao, the Overpower, who gives marching orders to the gods.  I know that this is what Ao does because I have read many other Forgotten Realms books.  Karpyshan seems not to have known or cared who Ao is; he sticks this angel in the book *only* to pull off an _angelus_ _ex_ _machina_, thwarting the high level of suspense created just before the end and forcing it into the result that 99.99% of readers will have expected just from reading the blurb on the back cover.   <br /> <br />The angel (who wears a robe of black with a psychedelic star pattern, which I interpreted as indicating that this creature *was* Ao until events proved otherwise), constantly prattles about what is permitted and not permitted, and then proceeds to do what is not permitted.  Ao, mind you, threw every god but one out of heaven because a few of them cheesed him off.  We are to believe that he is going to let a mere angel disobey orders and alter the theological history of Faerun forever?  I don't think so!  A competent editor would have cut that thing from the book and told Karpyshyn to figure out some other way for Abdel to move around and know what he knows.  This book did not have a competent editor. <br /> <br />(About the protagonist's name:  I don't know who is to be blamed for the name \\"Abdel Adrian,\\" but as anyone who is even slightly familiar with Arabic, or who has ever read a baby name book -- or the AD&D book \\"Arabian Adventures\\"! -- knows, \\"abd-el\\" means \\"servant of\\" and is meaningless on its own; it must be followed by another word/name to show of whom the person so designated is the servant.  In this series the central character's name literally translates as \\"servant of Adrian\\" --  as roughly *one billion people* could have told anyone at Wizards who cared enough to ask.  Every time I came across his stupid \\"name\\" I kept wondering:  \\"Who's Adrian?\\"  Every page of this book burns with the result of such sloppy editing.) <br /> <br />I give this book two stars because the sections about the essence of Bhaal being manipulated by the Chosen of Bhaal are interesting (to me), and the ending -- except for the damned angel -- was well-done.  I have not read the first two books in the trilogy.  If other readers are to be believed, they are far worse than this book!	2005-07-12

Thousands of terms used by the British and American underworld are carefully explained and, in some cases, early literary references are also noted. <br />  <br />A few examples of this strange dialect include:  \\"eternity box,\\" a coffin; \\"Mahometan gruel,\\" for coffee (because it was introduced from Muslim Turkey); \\"one of us\\" or \\"one of my cousins\\" was used for a harlot; \\"quill driver,\\" a scribe or hackney writer; \\"Friday face,\\" a dismal countenace (because Fridays were fast days in The Roman Church); \\"goloshes\\" comes from \\"Goliath's shoes,\\" so-called because these outer shoes are very large; \\"Bo-Peep,\\" one who sometimes hides and sometimes shows himself in public.

US	50919295	R2DP7ERO04W0BE	0312874561	671493062	Tales of the Dying Earth	Books	5	8	8	N	N	This is a terrific collection	Others here have described this collection in detail, so I shall limit myself to a few observations:   <br /> <br /> <br />1.  This is the origin of \\"Vancian magic,\\" the basis of all Dungeons & Dragons magic in which the caster of a spell forgets it immediately after casting it.  Vance actually explains why this is so, and he does it far better than any D & D writer ever has. <br /> <br />2.  This is the origin of many D & D spells and magic items, including Ioun Stones.  It is interesting to see how their creator used them, compared to how they came to be used in D & D. <br /> <br />3.  This is a wonderfully written collection! It's more than \\"just sci-fi,\\" it is *literature*. Although there are some weak spots and slow parts, it is easy to be swept along for fifty or a hundred pages at a time by Vance's wonderful characterizations of heroes, anti-heroes, and villains alike, and his Swiftian descriptions of exotic societies.  One thing which may not be apparent at first to the casual reader is that by \\"Dying Earth,\\" Vance means an Earth hundreds of millions of years in the future, when the Sun itself is believed to be on the verge of death; whether this is before or after the sun has gone red and burned up the Earth is impossible to determine -- the sun has either done so in the past and the people and animals of the \\"Dying Earth\\" have arisen since then and the sun will soon dwindle to a cold little star unable to sustain advanced forms of life on Earth, or else it is getting ready to erupt unexpectdly and wipe out the inner planets, including Earth.   There is also NEVER any indication that the characters of the central narratives are human beings as we are, only that they have certain body parts with which we may identify:  arms, legs, heads, etc.  When the heroes face bizarre-looking creatures, they do NOT write them off as \\"monsters\\" just because of their looks, as often happens in D & D.  Rather, strange-looking humanoids are regarded as just another form of person, albeit physically different from the main characters.  Thee are a few exceptions, though -- creatures so inimical to \\"people\\" that they are always considered monsters, including the \\"grue,\\" a strange beast which will stir familiar memories in those who played \\"Adventure\\" years ago, before it became \\"Zork.\\" <br /> <br />I have read this book and want to read it again.  I have commended it to friends to purchase and read.  Despite its occasional slow parts, I give it 5 stars -- you really should give this a try if you like fantasy or science fiction.  It is something which will bless your literary palate with sensations strangely familiar, but nevertheless exotic, like a spice which you can recognize but cannot name.  Bon apetit!	2005-04-14
US	50919295	R2PTNALIGEEVHO	074347676X	150840016	The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen	Books	1	6	11	N	N	A complete waste of time	There is a theory that *any* time spent reading is time well spent.  If this is the reading matter, I disagree -- separating one's belly-button lint into individual strands would be time better spent.  The quality of writing would be barely acceptable from a middle school student.  The \\"plot,\\" such as it is, would be barely acceptable from a grade schooler.  The two big moments of the book are the destruction of Venice by a method so incredibly illogical and moronic that it would be an unacceptable plot device coming from anyone older than seven, and a raid by The League on a castle in (pick one: Mongolia, Manchuria, Russia, Siberia -- the author clearly has no idea, so your guess is as good as any). <br /> <br />The big final battle is BORING.  Every significant match-up is telegraphed so far in advance that it contains NO surprises -- except for the illogical dei ex machinae.  One such example of space-filling is the introduction (out of nowhere) of armored fighting suits -- which can fire exploding shells which won't penetrate a door and which can be be cut down by an assailant with a knife. <br /> <br />The whole reason for calling The League into existence, when revealed, is so STOOPID as to almost defy belief.  We learn, ultimately, that the destruction of Venice is little more than a ploy to take some photographs and goose a few people!  As if it would have been so hard for the traitor in The League to have just walked up to any of the other members and done in a moment what it takes more than a hundred pages of text for him to accomplish! <br /> <br />Copies of this are available for one cent.  Don't waste your money!  I felt that I had been cheated of all the time I wasted on this book.  If you can get a copy of the COMIC book, by all means read it -- it's a ripping good yarn; this novelization is just cheap hackwork.	2005-04-06

It contains short histories of pivotal events in Chinese history to illustrate particular doctrines of Chinese political or military philosophy, such as warring on those states nearby but allying with states far away. <br /> <br />Not having seen this edition I do not know if it contains the original Wade-Giles transliterations of Chinese words and names or has been converted to the God-awful \\"pinyin\\" system in which letters are pronounced without any consideration of how they are spoken in any Western language.  If this edition has pinyin, my advice is to to skip it and buy an old copy with Wade-Giles trabnsliteration, which is *intended* for English-speakers and in which most non-Communist histories of China have been published.   <br /> <br />Chinese history can be very hard for the non-specialist to follow because of the unfamiliar words and names and the frequent re-use of a name throughout its five millennia of history.  \\"The Chinese Machiavelli\\" contains all that the average reader needs to know to understand whatever Chinese theory the authors are trying to illustrate.  The Chinese theory is explained clearly and it is illustrated by historical vignettes written in easy-to-understand English with relatively little use of unnecessary Chinese terms.  The latter point is particularly helpful since Chinese words often have several meanings depending on their context.  The Bloodworths are careful to explain all of the nuances of the words relevant to the concept which they are  describing, and mercifully forego unnecessary jargon. <br /> <br />\\"The Chinese Machiavelli\\" is an outstanding entry-level introduction to Chinese history and politics and is very helpful to those trying to understand seemingly illogical decisions made by Chinese bureaucrats and politicians, both now and in the past.	2005-03-04
US	50919295	RUXLU96M9W9BU	0898158397	664495385	Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World: An Identification Guide	Books	5	197	202	N	N	Outstanding guide by one of the world's leading mycologists	This lavishly photo-illustrated and smoothly-written book details all of the psilocybin-containing mushrooms generally known up to the date of publication, including those outside of the species Psilocybe and some extremely rare ones known only from a single location or from a single event (sometimes mysterious magic mushrooms crop up after storms but are never seen again unless spores are taken from them and grown under controlled conditions).      Stamets explains the often-conflicting taxonomy of Psilocybe mushrooms (one species, for example, received two different names because two writing teams who had travelled together wrote it up separately -- one published first and *their* name has \\"priority,\\" even though some people use the name given by the other team; despite the name difference the mushroom described is the same species).    Stamets is no prude.  He writes quite bluntly about psilocybin-containing mushrooms (including his own tripping on them), and he is EXTREMELY (and justly) critical of other mycologists who not only refuse to describe such mushrooms, but, in one case Stamets cites, have said that it is better for people to die from eating poisonous mushrooms than for people to be able to safely identify psilocybin-containing mushrooms!  Stamets gives descriptions and photos of poisonous look-alike mushrooms and gives a step-by-step identification procedure for the psilocybin 'shrooms.  In most cases identification is straightforward and can be done within a few minutes; in other cases look-alikes can be lethal and suspect mushrooms have to be carefully gone over to avoid poisoning.      One extemely curious phenomenon which Stamets describes are cases in which people have \\"tripped\\" on mushrooms which are generally considered non-poisonous and which were from species which are not supposed to contain *any* psychoactive chemicals; Stamets speculates that if these cases are genuine, they may represent instances in which the biochemistry of one individual reacted in a completely unpredictable and near-unique way to a \\"normal\\" mushroom.  (I have heard of some people whose bodies can *naturally* manufacture ethanol from the ordinary sugars in food in sufficient quantites to become drunk without ever having consumed liquid alcohol; these freak instances of people tripping on non-pyshoactive mushrooms may represent something similar -- rare individuals whose bodies can convert innocuous chemicals into psychoactive ones; since the reported cases have been people who didn't intend to eat a magic mushroom in the first place, and who have probably sworn off mushroom eating forever as a result of their experience, the likelihood of a repeat occurence with a given individual is probably close to zero.  Still, the fact that such an unexpected event has occurred at all underscores a couple of points which Stamets makes again and again:  don't eat any wild mushroom which you have not positively identified, and don't gorge yourself on a species which you *have* identified until you have taken a small sample to see how your own body reacts to them.)    One interesting feature of the book is an estimate of the relative potency of psilocybin-containing mushrooms and an explanation of why some cultivated mushrooms differ widely in potency even though they belong to the same species.  Some members of the species Psilocybe actually don't contain any psilocybin at all, but apparently all members of the species either taste bad or are too chewy to be used for food, even the non-psychoactive ones.      The only weakness of the book is that it does not contain a section describing the numerous cultivated varieties of P. cubensis, which vary greatly in appearance and growing requirements (and, according to the vendors, at least) in potency.  Many of these varieties have doubtless \\"gone wild\\" (Stamets says that the grounds of universities and the outside of courthouses are two of the best places to hunt \\"wild\\" psilocybin mushrooms!), but there is only one listing for the species with photos of what are presumably wild varities not derived from artificial selection by growers.    Stamets is a true fan of mushrooms and his commercial website (he doesn't sell psilocybin mushrooms, by the way) gives examples of how mushrooms can be used in bioremediation of polluted lands and used to improve the yields of crops.  Stamets points out that one of the best places to look for wild muchrooms is on land which has just been hit by a storm or where humans have just ravaged it to put up or tear down a building.  Although Stamets has not gone as far off the deep end as did Terrence McKenna and his brother (writing under their own names or as \\"Ott and Osric\\"), it is apparent that he, like many other partakers of magic mushrooms, believes them to be a vital part of Gaia and their spread by humans to be part of planetary evolution.  As a simple example, those hunting for \\"magic\\" mushrooms will (whether deliberately or not) carry magic mushroom spores back from where they are found, but they will also carry the spores of other species which grow nearby and are, in their turn, vital ecological components even if they aren't psychoactive:  just growing *near* a psychoactive mushroom gives other mushrooms an evolutionary advantage as their spores are dispersed by primates anxious to go tripping but whose hair or fur or clothes brush against other species of mushroom and carry their spores to another location.  It becomes easy to see why some people believe that psychoactive mushrooms (especially the Psilocybe species) have co-evolved with humans as a means to enhance the biosphere of Gaia.    I give this book five well-deserved stars.  I know of know other book which contains so much information about magic mushroom history and mycology and provides such clear-cut and easy to follow steps for identifying the psilocybin-containg species. If nothing else it is beautiful to look at. *****	2005-03-04

None of the three performers sounds even vaguely Hispanic, and some of their acting is quite strained.  I heard a copy which had undoubtedly been much-played and which had been subject to who-knows-what storage conditions, but the audio quality was atrociously bad:  all of the sound had a \\"shadow\\" running several seconds ahead of the main presentation of audio.  Schubert's titular quartet (which appears on the tape one generation down, out of necessity, since it \\"appears\\" as an audio tape played during the recording of the play) did not sound as if it had been performed by top drawer musicians; this may have been a fault of the poor sound quality, but it didn't move me as it should have.  The motion picture is much, much MUCH better than this recording of the play.	2005-02-20

Each was asked to submit a story which \\"defines them as a writer.\\"  The result is a mixed bag of stories ranging from mundane naturalism to philosophically probing science fiction. <br />  <br />It's impossible to sum up this work in a very brief review, so let it suffice to say that if you like the work of the individual authors, you'll probably enjoy their submissions to the anthology. <br /> <br />Personally I found the lack of rigid criteria for the stories to be distracting.  While it is apparent that each individual writer is good, the change of tone and subject matter from story to story made it impossible for me to enjoy this as \\"a good read.\\"  This is the sort of anthology which one pulls out every once in a while to read one or two stories at most, then shelves until another day. <br /> <br />One serious flaw of the anthology is that it lacks any real introduction of the writers for the benefit of the reader.  Surely there should be SOMETHING to preface a story which a writer considers to be definitive of his or her self, but there is nothing but a half-sentence or so about each story in the foreward.  Surely the publishers could do better than that for their readers (AND the writers!).  Andy Duncan's story is a strange fantasy entitled, \\"The Haw River Trolley,\\" a very short piece with some fine writing (e.g., \\"Old Whitesell knew there was no way in creation any part of that trolley could go five miles a minute even if you blew it up and clocked the fragments, but like most people who know the impossible to be true, or the truth to be impossible, he kept his mouth shut\\"), but after that paragraph the story becomes progressively more strange until at the very end I was wondering whether I had stumbled across a story which was part of a larger collection with characters whose lives I was already supposed to know of, or whether some mistake had deleted a half dozen paragraphs, or if the author was known for bizarre fantasy stories.  Even though Duncan rated A WHOLE SENTENCE TO HIMSELF in the Foreward, I still don't know anything about his other work, and the result is overall dissatisfaction with this story.  The final story in the collection, \\"Fire Dog,\\" is definitely a strange fantasy, but I KNOW that author Joe R. Lansdale writes some bizarre material, so I was not surprised by anything in his story of a man takes a job as a firehouse dog (a dalmation named \\"Spot\\"); indeed, the lack of surprise was itself surprising -- I've read better works by Lansdale, which brings me back to my complaint:  why did he select THIS story as his submission?  While there is some excellent material in this anthology, such as Howard Waldrop's \\"Why Then Ile Fit You,\\" about a senile, dying actor, I began to get the feeling that I was reading not what many of these writers considered to be their best OR most definitive work, but rather what they couldn't sell anywhere else. <br />  <br />I could not finish \\"The Silver Gryphon.\\"  The disjointed nature of the anthology's selection made reading it too great a sacrifice of time for me at the present.  I have given the book three stars, though, because there IS some good material here, and Golden Gryphon fans will surely find something to enjoy in the selection.  It just wasn't my cuppa.	2004-08-28

I can't tell what the scale of the &quot;D & D Miniatures&quot; is SUPPOSED to be (probably 30mm), but the figures are strangely proportioned to one another within their own product line -- the bare-chested Giants of Legend Scarlet Brotherhood Monk is dispropotionately large compared to both the City Guardsman and the Protectar, and the robed Archfiends Sage is as broad in the shoulders as the Giants of Legend City Guard in armor.<br /><br /> My second and third concerns are with the weapons. Why are the weapons so bizarrely fashioned? The standard Wizards of the Coast fantasy sword has a blade which abruptly narrows in size to only slightly wider than the tang, although in this set only the Human Dragonslayer and Moon Elf Fighter appear to suffer from this certain-to-snap-at-first-contact blade. This design makes no sense. It copies a fashion set in some fantasy art, but is jarringly out of place in figures which seemed designed for melee combat. The weapons are also being used stupidly by the figures, with the point-of-spear-in-the-ground City Guard being the silliest example. This leads to another concern: why did Wizards of the Coast feel it necessary to arm EVERY human or humanoid figure? The Archfiends Expansion Pack figure of the Healer, for example, is carrying a spear (point UP, unlike the idiotic Guardsman figure). If this Healer is a spellcaster, wouldn't it have been more appropriate to equip her with a spell book or put her into a spellcasting pose? If she can't cast spells, why is she in a melee set armed with a spear, anyway? She's not brandishing it point outward, but it still seems extremely inappropriate. It's as disconcerting as seeing a medic with a Red Cross brassard armed with an assault rifle; medical personnel are supposed to be unarmed, by god!<br /><br /> Arming the &quot;Healer&quot; is a very, VERY poor example for Hasbro to set for children. Does Medic G. I. Joe pack a .45 in his first aid kit to shoot &quot;enemy&quot; wounded? I am not one of those silly geese who think D & D leads to devil worship, but I AM of the opinion that children should be raised from childhood to regard certain people -- medical personnel, for example -- as ALWAYS being non-combatants, no matter which side they are on. I get the feeling that if there was a goblin stretcher crew figure set, that the ideal Wizards of the Coast &quot;lawful good&quot; character would hack them to pieces because they are on the &quot;evil&quot; side. That is just plain wrong! There are some lines which simply should not be crossed, even in fantasy role-playing, and the well-armed &quot;Healer&quot; crosses one of those lines. It isn't hard to imagine kids who play with this particular figure growing up to cross that same line in a real life war; therein lie the seeds of the My Lais and Abu Graibs of the future, I'm afraid. Wizards of the Coast should discontinue this figure. It is grossly irresponsible of them to depict medical personnel as combatants.<br /><br /> I must disagree strongly with the other reviewer about the Warrior Skeletons. The ones I have are painted nicely, true, but either the injection molding was done poorly or else they were attached to the base poorly -- they are both bent forward so far that they look more like skeletal bloodhounds than anything else. They LOOK as though they were made in Red China by some wretchedly poor schmuck earning less than 50 cents an hour (which they probably were). It will take some unattractive wiring or else a break-and-repair job to make them stand erect.<br /><br /> All in all, though, the figures do what they are supposed to do, which is represent heroes and monsters from the Wizards Dungeons & Dragons product line. Their usefulness as figures for war games outside of the rules published (VERY expensively!) by Wizards of the Coast is greatly diminished by their &quot;buy one hundred packages to collect 'em all!&quot; packaging, which has led to my initial force having one sage to each archer, with no one pointing a spear at the ENEMY. Their usefulness outside of D & D Miniatures rules play is also hampered by the paucity of figures clearly designed to represent the sort of massed levies to be found in a real battle, even a &quot;real fantasy&quot; battle. There should be several figures each for plain old goblins, plain old orcs, plain old human warriors, etc., but there isn't, and the bizarre scale of the figures makes it very difficult to supplement their numbers with the military or fantasy figures of other manufacturers (which are almost all in lead or very expensive pewter, anyway, not the cheap plastic of these figures).<br /><br /> The D & D miniatures DO fill a need for cheap miniature fantasy figures, but that need includes the need for hordes of cheap goblins, orcs, etc., which Wizards seems to have no intention of meeting. They are narrowly focused on supplying figures for the rules which they have concocted and are not supplying enough to use the figures for battles using &quot;De Bellis Antiquas,&quot; &quot;Hordes of the Things,&quot; or even &quot;Chainmail&quot; rules for miniatures gaming, which is ironic, since D & D was originally just a set of rules for adding fantasy characters to wargames which used the 1970-something &quot;Chainmail&quot; rules.<br /><br /> If Wizards of the Coast were to offer their &quot;common&quot; figures in three-packs or six-packs (the numbers needed for units in their own miniatures gaming rules), my rating for the expansion packs would be higher, but they haven't done so yet, and they seem to have no intention of ever doing so, which forces players who DO want to use units of multiple figures to either buy large numbers of expansion packs (expanding the already bloated profits which Wizards of the Coast brings in for its corporate owner, Hasbro) or else buy them separately on eBay, which, once shipping costs are added, makes each figure cost a couple of bucks apiece -- a huge mark-up for a pennysworth of plastic made by a Chinese wage slave living just above the subsistence level!ss than 50 cents an hour (which they probably were).

US	50919295	R1AY0LUSHTA5HI	0786927593	724647879	Faiths and Pantheons (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying, Forgotten Realms Setting)	Books	2	6	14	N	N	Bend over and take it!	This book would be a waste of money for most people. Almost all of the important information about human deities has been extensively presented in the Second Edition softcover perfect-bound books, &quot;Powers & Pantheons&quot; and &quot;Faiths & Avatars,&quot; with information on non-human deities available in the Second Edition &quot;Deities & Demigods&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Legends and Lore&quot;). Adapting the abilities of the deities to Dungeons & Dragons 3.$ edition stats is fine for those people who run games in which the player characters interact with divine avatars on a regular basis, but for those who leave the gods in their heavens (or home planes), that information is of only incidental importance. <br />  <br /> The Second Edition books may all be purchased on Amazon or eBay for a COMBINED price less than the $33 pricetag of this edition. <br />  <br /> Something which every potential purchaser should be warned of is that the book CLAIMS that it and another previously published book list ALL of the deities of Abeir-Toril (the world of the D & D Forgotten Realms campaign setting). That's a bold-faced lie. The publishers, Wizards of the Coast, have just come out with a new book listing a bunch of new non-human deities, and they are in the process of re-engineering the Forgotten Realms to drastically alter Lolth, the famous spider-queen demon/goddess. This $33 book is ALREADY obsolete in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. <br />  <br /> There are a few new magical spells and gew-gaws in here and some new prestige classes (which are easy to write and take up lots of space as filler material), but there's not enough of that to justify the exhorbitant price. There are some divine feats and abilities listed, too, but much of the &quot;original&quot; material there is already available in the D & D Third Edition book, &quot;Deities and Demigods.&quot; <br />  <br /> Unless someone is running a Forgotten Realms D &D campaign in which the gods or their avatarsare very active participants, a book-buyer's money would be much better spent buying the three second edition books I mentioned and just doing a few mental calculations to adjust the deities for Third Edition. Those three together cost less than this book alone, and provide twice as much information, nearly all of it still relevant to the Forgotten Realms. <br />  <br /> The book has almost no use to non-Forgotten Realms D & D campaigns except as a sourcebook from which to derive divine characters for other campaigns. <br />  <br /> The art of the book is nice. The overall &quot;look&quot; is nice.&quot; The lay-out is comprehensible. Nevertheless, the total of all its virtues is worth far less than its listed price. As a fifteen dollar softcover this would be a good deal. As a $33 hardback it is for die-hards only.	2004-08-05

When I was young I had read all of Howard's Conan stories and the DeCamp and Carter pastiches, so I was incredibly excited when Marvel brought out the Conan the Barbarian comic books. This volume is a compilation of the first eight issues (sans the covers, unfortunately - a big minus!). <br />  <br /> In Mark Schultz's foreward to &quot;The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian,&quot; which compiles all of Howard's Conan stories in the order in which he wrote them, he observes that there is no mistaking a Howard story. Reading through that book I was shocked at how elegant and cleanly and clearly written were the Howard stories compared to later pastiches and original stories by other writers. Conan was Howard's and Howard's alone to write, it seems. That holds true in this volume, too. Although all of the stories are written by Roy Thomas, the absolute best (and memory tells me that they were the best when these were still new comics) are those originally written by Howard himself or derived from his material: &quot;Twilight of the Grim Grey God,&quot; &quot;Tower of the Elephant&quot; (a very, very memorable piece, even thirty+ years later), &quot;The Lurker Within&quot; (from Howard's story, &quot;The God in the Bowl,&quot; it is strong in the parts where it follows Howard's story, weak in the new additions), and one of the most memorable Conan comics of all, &quot;Keepers of the Crypt,&quot; based on an original Howard synopsis. The latter especially suffers from the lack of its magnificent cover. <br />  <br /> Fortunately, the Afterward by Thomas helps to explain the history of the Marvel comic and the hows and whys of the ups and downs of the comic's popularity, and how it was tied to the (not published here!) covers. <br />  <br /> Even without the covers (how we must hammer on that in the hope that future editions will have them) this is an excellent book and a worthy addition to the library of any comic collector or fan of Conan. <br />  <br /> I give this 4 stars, the fifth missing because of the absence of ... you know what. <br />	2004-07-31
US	50919295	RT7KPI0GZTMY2	1903980917	556624180	Encyclopaedia Arcane: Crossbreeding - Flesh And Blood	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Well-constructed guide to monster-making	&quot;Crossbreeding: Flesh and Blood&quot; is part of the &quot;Encycloaedia Arcane&quot; line of accessory books for d20 fantasy role playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It is a handbook for players and GMs who want a standardized set of easy-to-consult rules for crossbreeding animals and/or monsters to make new creatures.<br />This is one of the &quot;crunchiest&quot; Encycloaediae Arcane I have seen. The inside front and back covers are filled with the crossbreeding tables from the book, and make using &quot;Crossbreeding&quot; remarkably easy: a one-time read-through and access to the tables is all that should be necessary to get gamers into the monster-making business ... or art ... or defiant tampering with the Laws of Nature, depending upon your point of view.<br />The book is set up like the other Encycloaediae Arcane, with an introduction to the subject and the book, and closing words from the designer (author Jonathan Richards). The beginning of the book's &quot;meat&quot; discusses the general hows and whys of crossbreeding, and is lacking, in this reviewer's opinion, in a sufficient exploration of the MOTIVES for crossbreeding. One way this might have been rectified is by including more grey-lighted narratives of &quot;actual&quot; crossbreeders (such as Waldimer, who has a full page across from the Introduction, but of whom we hear no more, or Sasha, on page 33, whose &quot;successful&quot; experiment on herself doesn't quite satisfy her). Other gamers do not like such narratives, I know, and dismiss them as &quot;fluff,&quot; but the subject of magical crossbreeding has been dealt with rarely in gaming, so it would have been very nice to have more insight into the mindset of crossbreeding wizards rather than just dismissing crossbreeding as a stage in a typical wizardly career (which it most certainly isn't). I think Jonathan Richards shows himself as a good enough narrative writer that a bit more of the &quot;grey matter&quot; would have been helpful.<br />Richards does introduce one very powerful rule mechanic which deserves adoption in most games: the reason why hybrid monsters can't be &quot;simply&quot; created with a polymorph spell is that there MUST exist a template creature for a creature being transformed by a polymorph spell. Fuzzy bunnies exist, therefore a creature may be polymorphed into a fuzzy bunny. Owlbears exist, so creatures may be polymorphed into owlbears. Richards suggests, however, that before the first owlbear was created by crossbreeding, it would have been impossible to polymorph anything into an owlbear. Very Platonic. Very useful. And a good reason for mages to want to crossbreed creatures: to make things into which to polymorph other creatures.<br />Richards provides an elegantly simple chart for what the monster type of a crossbreed would be, and I found nothing to argue about in it. An &quot;aberration&quot; crossed with a &quot;vermin&quot; yields an &quot;aberration;&quot; a &quot;humanoid&quot; crossed with an &quot;outsider&quot; yields another &quot;outsider&quot; (damn those evil cultists!). Note that in order to properly understand this chart one must be familiar with monster &quot;types&quot; as outlined in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Core Rulebook III, the &quot;Monster Manual.&quot;<br />&quot;Crossbreeding&quot; next gives a selection of suggested magical crossbreeding rituals (followed by attendant new magical items for said rituals). Parents should note that Richards does not give details for any of these rituals which might lead an impressionable youngster to actually undertake a magical hybridization of Fluffy and Kitty. Richards states in his Designer's Notes that this was to allow gamers to create spells appropriate to their own campaigns, but it also makes the book acceptable to younger gamers than it would have been had he introduced more specifics.<br />Tables of possible results from various crossbreeding experiments are given (and reproduced inside the covers). These deal with most eventualities of crossbreeding experiments, detailing the possible results of crossing what with what to obtain this or that result. Note that a familiarity with the core rules of the d20 system are required to apply these in a game, although someone playing D &amp;D under second edition rules (or playing an entirely different game) could probably &quot;homebrew&quot; adaptations of the charts for the local gaming campaign.<br />&quot;Crossbreeding&quot; also has a large selection of &quot;known&quot; hybrids (which means creatures into which others may be &quot;officially&quot; polymorphed if these rules are adopted for a game). Among the noteworthy critters are the &quot;Gulor,&quot; a cross between an orc and a wolverine, the &quot;Ooze Hound,&quot; a hybrid of riding dog and grey ooze, the &quot;Slithertoad,&quot; part snake and part toad, the &quot;Skyshark,&quot; a flying cross of dire bat and shark, and the &quot;Haemovorid,&quot; a hybrid of pixie and stirge (&quot;I'm not making this up, you know!&quot;). Although some gamers simply can't get enough of new monsters, this is one section which I personally found over-long, and I would have gladly sacrificed the page-and-one-half given to the Mud Elemental (are there not enough on the Para-Elemental Plane of Mud or Ooze or whtever it's called?!) for more narrative material. (&quot;Fluff!&quot; comes the cry from the peanut gallery, but I stand by my opinion.)<br />Another reviewer elsewhere than Amazon has zapped &quot;Crossbreeding&quot; already for a serious editorial gaffe which I must echo: on page 30 an incorrect illustration is used for the &quot;Spidertoad,&quot; the new hybrid familiar which is used as an example for a crossbreeding experiment -- our first held-by-the-hand walkthrough of the process.

Woe betide the foolish GM who uses the illustration as an example of what a &quot;spidertoad&quot; looks like!<br />I really enjoyed &quot;Crossbreeding.&quot; Its rules mechanics were clearcut and easily applicable, its layout was almost uniformly good, and the charts on the inside covers were very useful. I give &quot;Crossbreeding&quot; four stars and recommend it for Gamemasters and (with GM approval) for PCs, too.  I give it 4 stars.	2004-07-17

There are no necromantic spells or feats presented for wizards, just brilliantly conceived undead.   Among the monstrosities presented are the &quot;Atrocity Wight ... a depraved jigsaw puzzle pieced together out of dozens of hunanoid corpses,&quot; the &quot;Bloodpool ... created when innocents are killed en masse and their blood is allowed collect and merge. ... A bloodpool in its natural form resembles a roiling pool of bright crimson liquid, and can be mistaken for a new type of ooze or slime.&quot;  There are &quot;Dream Phantoms,&quot; the souls of those who died in their sleep and now haunt the living, and &quot;Eternal Confessors,&quot; undead clerics carrying on the work of their god even after death -- try turning one of those!  &quot;Forever Jacks&quot; are thieves who cheated death and now are nearly impossible to destroy (CR 12!).<br />The term of venery for a group of crows is &quot;a murder&quot; -- a murder of crows.  &quot;Necromantic Lore&quot; gives us the &quot;Horrid Murder,&quot; a flock of crows possessed by a malignant undead intelligence.  Think of Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Birds&quot; coming at a party.  Think of a party afraid of every bird call for fear that it is a &quot;Horrid Murder&quot; of crows coming to get them!<br />Does the party's wizard think he can handle planar creatures?  Let him face a &quot;Necromental&quot; -- an undead elemental -- and watch him run!  Malevolent whirlpools, giant apparitions in the sky and troops of wind-swept zombies are enough to make all but the toughest parties tremble.<br />Want something smaller to horrify your players?  Try unleashing the &quot;Pale Masker,&quot; an undead face-hugger that forms a symbiotic bond with its victim, or the &quot;Shadow Parasite,&quot; which merges with its victims shadow.  <br />Not ALL of the beasties in &quot;Necromantic Lore&quot; are malevolent.  The &quot;Guiding Spirit&quot; protects its loved ones from beyond the grave.  What might happen if a cleric determined to rid the world of undead decides that a party member's ghostly grandpa has got to be destroyed?  What should a party do?  Help destroy an undead thing or fight a cleric to protect their ghostly friend?<br />&quot;Necromantic Lore&quot; is filled with terrific undead monsters to unleash on a party or placed to plague a location with which the party is familiar.  This is a GREAT addition to any DM's library. Five stars!	2004-07-03
US	50919295	RDG32KQ5OSCG3	1887953582	388994827	Mercenaries (d20 Fantasy Roleplaying)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Outstanding guide for players &amp; GMs	This is a superb book which DMs or players can use to understand what mercenaries are, where they come from, how they operate, and why some of them do what they do -- fight for money.<br />The &quot;fighter&quot; class in most role-playing games is a character with no clearly defined role in society.  A bard entertains, clerics and druids care for the spiritual and /or physical needs of those they care for, rangers are hunters and scouts, thieves are ... well ... thieves, and magic-users are either scholarly recluses or people who interact with the community for good or ill with their magical powers.  Fighters just ... fight.  When there is no battle brewing or adventure to go on, what do fighters DO?  They either become trouble-making brawlers or else they get jobs.  If they work at farming or some trade, they pick up experience as commoners or as experts (in 3rd edition D &amp; D, anyway).  If they become soldiers working for a noble or for a city or country, they are warriors who are burdened with the regular duties of a soldier:  cleaning equipment, standing for inspection, pulling long night watches or boring garrison duty.<br />If a fighter wants to keep fighting even when not adventuring, then the mercenary career may beckon, and AEG's &quot;Mercenaries&quot; tells the whole story, from why someone would want to become a mercenary, to how to get a job (or how to hire mercenaries if you're on the other side of the coin), to what may await a mercenary in retirement.<br />&quot;Mercenaries&quot; is, as far as I know, the ONLY book in the whole history of fantasy role playing gaming to be devoted entirely to mercenaries and their careers, so it is, of necessity, the best book there is on the subject, but the AEG writing team (Noah Dudley, Andrew Getting, Travis Heerman, etc.) didn't settle for second-rate writing -- they wrote as if they intend this book to REMAIN the best even when other books on this subject are published.<br />I wasn't terribly impressed by the very first chapter on new races -- I think we have enough PC races already -- but it is well-written and well-illustrated. I personally thought this chapter was unnecessary; other GMs may love it and use some of the races.  (The first race --the Aradan, rat-like vermin who can leap into battle with twin daggers! -- may especially appeal to some GMs; the drawing for it is certainly clever!)<br />Every other chapter in &quot;Mercenaries&quot; has something which almost any player or GM could put to good use.  The book also helps to raise some serious questions which might arise when mercenaries are employed.  What, for example, will a lawful good mercenary do if his company has been hired to fight for an evil cause?  He has a contract; to break it would be unlawful and against his alignment; to stick to the contract may mean doing evil deeds for an evil cause, again going against his alignment. What does a lawful good ruler do when he needs an experienced army fast and the only troops available are a lawful evil mercenary company, who will follow their contract, but do who-knows-what in battle, and donate their pay to who-knows-what evil gods, but who WILL win whatever battle the lawful good ruler needs won? &quot;Mercenaries&quot; sums up the dilemma by returning often to the basic principle that a mercenary is someone who fights for money.  If you take a job and are paid, you do the job, no matter what; if you need mercenaries, you hire the best fighters you can afford, regardless of their morals.  AEG books excel at getting players and GMs into role-playing situations, and &quot;Mercenaries&quot; presents many examples of situations where role-play would be a lot better than just rolling dice.<br />The chapter on mercenary companies should provide inspiration for GMs who want to create a group of paid fighters into which to funnel those fighter PCs between dungeon crawls, and also inspiration for PCs who would like to form their own &quot;official&quot; mercenarycompanies (a requirement in order to bear arms in many lawful societies).<br />The chapters on &quot;classes&quot; and &quot;prestige classes&quot; are NOT a waste of space as so many added classes and &quot;prestige classes&quot; are in other gaming supplements.  These classes are ACTUALLY USEFUL!  I would suggest that a GM and a player mix and match information in order to find the perfect career plan for a PC, and &quot;Mercenaries&quot; provides all of the information needed for a PC to grow from raw recruit to trusted bodyguard, pillar of the community, royal (or racial) champion -- or dreaded assassin or warlord.<br />One of the ironies of military history is that during the heyday of the &quot;great companies&quot; of mercenaries in late Medieval and early Renaissance Italy, many of the great companies rarely FOUGHT at all!  They would often be hired, go to a battlefield, check out the deployment of the enemy company, skirmish very briefly, and then decide on the basis of tactical probablities and the reputations of the two captains and their companies who the likely winner of the battle would be, shake hands and have a good meal, freely spending their pay, and then announce to their employers who &quot;won&quot; the &quot;battle&quot; which they didn't fight!  AEG's &quot;Mercenaries&quot; can help you to create mercenary companies with such extraordinary reputations that they can win battles simply by showing up.  The path to that level may be long and hard, though, and &quot;Mercenaries&quot; can help you to create &quot;guerillas,&quot; &quot;legionnaires,&quot; &quot;scouts&quot; and such who will fight their way to legendary status.<br />I strongly recommend &quot;Mercenaries&quot; to all players and GMs.  Gamemasters ESPECIALLY should have a copy so that they can give some form and substance to the NPCs the characters face, making them into something other than just evil cannon fodder.  What does a PC Paladin do when he captures a lawful good mercenary who is fighting for an evil cause?  Slay him or hold him captive -- which might not be easy in the midst of a battle?  What does a hungry PC do when there is no money left and the only options are stealing or joining a mercenary company which may fight for an evil cause?  Decisions!  Decisions!  &quot;Mercenaries&quot; can help you to decide.  Buy it!<br />I also very strongly recommend AEG's &quot;War,&quot; ISBN 1887953450, as a companion to this volume.  Together they can take a military-style campaign to whole new levels.	2004-07-03
US	50919295	R3BYQNUYMV973K	0380798360	535649961	Declare	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Astonishingly good!	I started reading &quot;Declare&quot; with a great deal of scepticism.  I had previously read &quot;Stranger Tides&quot; and &quot;Anubis Gate,&quot; and was very leery of what looked like it was going to be a standard spy story.  OY!  What a surprise! I plowed through the entire book in only three days! <br />Powers doesn't get around to putting a firm identification of the What behind the mysterious goings-on of Operation Declare until page 160, but by then he has laid a firm groundwork of interesting characters and events of which the reader wants to learn more.  Once we learn something in &quot;Declare,&quot; however, Powers builds on it, and builds beautifully.<br />Although &quot;Declare&quot; deals with Andrew Hale and Elena for hundreds of pages, it's actually inspired by (seemingly minor character) Kim Philby, and, in his afterward, Powers states that his intent was to write a novel about Philby which explored his life and work without changing any of the well-known facts of Philby's life.  Its the interpretation which Powers puts on the events of Philby's life which make &quot;Declare&quot; mind-bogglingly good.  Who, after all, REALLY knows what goes on in the deepest, darkest recesses of the world of espionage?  Maybe some of the weirdness of the Looking Glass World really is due to a supernatural element, and if that supernatural element happened to be extremely ancient....<br />The title &quot;Declare,&quot; which hardly compels at first, DOES make sense.  Don't miss the reference to Job near the beginning of the book (&quot;Declare, if thous hast understanding....&quot;), and note the reactions of various characters to the word's use, and you won't be surprised yourself when the word turns up with greater frequency in various dialogues. One of the habits of Powers as a writer is his dropping of clues willy-nilly in plain sight, clues which only become significant when they've been seen again and again from different angles. In some books this has beenan annoyance; in &quot;Declare&quot; it is a virtue and an art.  (Consider the recurring phrase, &quot;O Fish ...&quot; -- at first it is gibberish in a dream, then begins to make sense, and then takes on a meaning so terrible that merely hearing the words can kill.)<br />From the Cotswolds to Cairo to the Rub al-Khali; from Paris to Berlin to al-Kuwait; from Beiruit to Mount Ararat to Moscow, &quot;Declare&quot; weaves around the world of The Great Game in Europe and the Middle East, and jumps backwards and forwards in time with breath-taking rapidity, but Powers has learned his craft well, and &quot;Declare&quot; never disappoints.  The number of &quot;slow&quot; pages numbers less than a dozen among 600+ pages.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in thrillers, spy novels, histories, or the supernatural.  It straddles all of those genres with ease.  Although it makes no reference to the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos,&quot; it would fit snugly into any &quot;Cthulhu Now&quot; framework, and Powers is a far better writer than most of the Mythos writers, including H. P. Lovecraft himself.	2004-05-15
US	50919295	R3KXV60HLTB7X0	0738702552	344702475	Gothic Grimoire	Books	1	59	91	N	N	Another waste of time and money	Like every other book Konstantinos peddles through Llewellyn, Gothic Grimoire can be reduced to one sentence:  &quot;Use wishful thinking and call it 'magic.'&quot;  Not as outright dangerous as his awful book on summoning spirits, this one is just the usual mish-mash of unrelated pseudo-&quot;occult&quot; drivel, but with the &quot;nocturnal&quot; brand logo slapped on it.  (How &quot;occult,&quot; i.e. &quot;hidden,&quot; is any of this stuff if every book Llewellyn publishes is a rehash of the same material?)  <br />Here's the Konstantinos recipe: take a dash of every &quot;Wiccan&quot; (i.e. Roman Catholic/Norse/Celtic) Solstice, Equinox, and cross-quarter festival, throw in some unrelated mumbo-jumbo about the Sumerians and Akkadians, sprinkle with some Hinduism, dump it all over some poorly grasped Greek philosophy and post-humanist Hebrew kabbalism and irrelevant jabber about the tarot, then puree it with pop psychology, add an extra fifty pages of filler and wide margins, call it &quot;Nocturnal&quot; something-or-other, and sell it for fifteen bucks or more per copy.  Repeat every year or two.  Laugh all the way to the bank.<br />Only once crediting a source, Konstantinos throws this same mess together every couple of years, but hangs it on a slightly different framework each time.  Anything written by this charlatan is about as intellectually challenging as a piece of soggy zwieback.  (Why FOUR &quot;elements&quot; instead of the Chinese FIVE elements?  Because that wouldn't jibe with all of the nearly identical drivel published by other Llewellyn writers?  Who knows?) <br />If you absolutely feel compelled to own a book by this huckster, look for a used copy for a dime (or better yet, get a free throw-away).	2004-05-11
US	50919295	R3830RW2DUDB29	0441626831	371597098	On Stranger Tides	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Voodoo pirates	Other reviewers have dealt with the plot in great detail, so I'll limit myself to saying that the cross-over of genres between voodoo and piracy is brilliantly executed.  This is, in my opinion, the best book by Tim Powers, with the possible exception of &quot;Declare.&quot;  That &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; may be sold for almost thirty dollars in &quot;acceptable&quot; condition shows the tremendous demand for it by cognoscenti.  <br />Blackbeard the pirate with slow matches smouldering in his beard -- a terror to behold.  He's even more terrible when you learn WHY he keeps those matches smouldering, and why he's made common cause with an insane one-armed widower who carries his dead wife's head in a box, ably assisted by a lecherous &quot;student&quot; whose has two main aspirations:  to win the love of the widower's bewitched daughter, and to ... well ... to become God.  Opposing them is reluctant puppeteer-turned-pirate Jack Shandy, who wants nothing more than to claim his stolen inheritance ... and to win the girl, of course.<br />This one proves the rule that &quot;price denotes quality&quot; -- of the text, if not the physical medium.  A beat-up paperback priced more than a new hardback?  That means &quot;classic.&quot;  I strongly reccomend it to all, me 'earties.  Aargh!	2004-04-29
US	50919295	R99AK5OHMX9Y8	187398278X	735454401	Simplicissimus (European Classics)	Books	4	58	60	N	N	Delightful English translation, but NOT the complete novel	Mitchell's translation of Grimmelshausen's picaresque novel about a boy from SW Germany in the 1620s who has his life disrupted by the Thirty Years War, into which he is swept up for decades is delightfully funny.  Unfortunately, Mitchell's version follows the commonly available (and artificially antiquated) Goodrick translation and omits the sixth book!  Grimmelshausen wrote a whole cycle of ten novels revolving around Simplicissimus and other Thirty Years War characters, most of which are not readily available in a contemporary English translation.  This, the core novel, is the most famous of the lot, but I can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of the sixth book, which was referenced by Borges (in &quot;The Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;) and by others.  I feel as though readers of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; must if they discover that they have read only the first part of his multi-part novel.  The work of Cervantes, however, is much more readily available in English than is Grimmelshausen, so the absence is easily rectified; with the Simplicissimus books, however, one takes what one can get.  Mitchell's translation of Books 1 - 5 is, fortunately, quite good, and there aren't any references in the first five books to events in the sixth book which would be weirdly jarring if the final book is missing, so there's no reason to feel cheated unless you KNOW that something has been left out.  Mitchell's version is in good colloquial English and is a fast and satisfying read.  I went through the whole book in a few days, finding it very difficult to put down.  Mitchell writes so smoothly that the reader is swept breathlessly along just as Simplicissimus himself was.<br />This is THE classic novel of the Thirty Years War, which caused the death of one-third the population of Germany and involved almost every country from Sweden to Italy and from Spain to Russia, and -- strangely enough -- it's a comedy.  Perhaps the war was so terrible that afterwards the only way for the survivors to stay sane was to laugh about the bitter joke which history played upon them.  &quot;Simplicissimus&quot; is regarded by many as a definitive account of the mood and temperment of many of the survivors.  Read it and laugh ... or weep.  It's the story of Everyman and Everywoman caught up in an insane war in which the only option is make everything a joke, because the reality of the situation is too terrible to consider.	2004-04-22

Fantasy Flight Games scores big with this one.  Subtitled &quot;A Compendium of Mystic Lore,&quot; it is a treasure trove of magical options for D20 System gaming, which are mercifully NOT interlinked, allowing GMs to pick and choose what they like and what helps their campaigns.<br />The new spells range from the terribly useful (for example, a gradually enhanced spell series for restoring writings ranging from single documents to whole tomes) to the simply terrible (for example, &quot;Burrowing Bony Digits,&quot; a Necromantic spell which sends forth up to five skeletal fingers to burrow their way into the bodies of targets who fail their Reflex saves, doing 1D6 impaling damage plus 1D6 additional burrowing damage for each three levels of the caster -- yecch!).<br />&quot;The Craft of Magic&quot; (one of my favorite parts) has sections on library construction, bookhunting (always necessary for that on-going Arcane research!), ideas for conducting magical research, constructing laboratories, new ideas for spell foci and components, and an extensive section on Bardic and Sorcerous magic, with new feats, PLUS a section on Ceremonial and Ritual Magic, both arcane and divine.<br />&quot;New Types of Magic&quot; introduced are &quot;Ward Magic&quot; (location-based enchantments used with &quot;ward tokens&quot; -- an idea once dealt with in &quot;Volo's Guide to the North&quot;), &quot;Chaos Magic,&quot; &quot;Cooperative Magic,&quot; and a long section on &quot;Religion,&quot; dealing with new types of divine spell casters and &quot;Small Gods,&quot; the &quot;minor&quot; deities which are so significant in the &quot;real world&quot; but which get such short shrift in gaming worlds.  Also introduced is &quot;Place Magic,&quot; the magic of arcane locations and nexuses of magical power, including religious shrines.<br />&quot;The Mundane Made Magical&quot; deals with Alchemy, Constructs, Magical Materials, and Familiars (with wonderful ideas on empowering them, making them finally WORTH the risk of having around).  My favorite familiar must now be &quot;the Grimoire,&quot; a tiny construct; suitably tinkered with, it is easily imagined as an autonomous, intelligent presence in the spellcaster's library, reading and interrogating other books to aid its master in research; I can readily imagine a canny sage having an entire library of mutually-referant books serving as so many processors in a library-sized magical &quot;computer,&quot; with a Grimoire familiar as the interface!<br />&quot;Magic Items&quot; include Glyph Eggs (the weakest contribution of the book, in my opinion -- just another vehicle for storing magic spells) and Personal Growth Items (Open Gaming Content!), which are items which advance along with their owners, gaining powers and experience (and presumably becoming the original source of many magic items which may now be created with feats:  before they were made as &quot;created items,&quot; many had to &quot;grow up&quot; to be magical).  There is also an Open Gaming Content section on Relics and the obligatory New magical Items section which every single D20 System book seems to have (although this one adds nine new Ioun Stone types).<br />&quot;Spells &amp; Spellcraft&quot; is not an essential book, by any means, so I have only given it four stars, but, for those who like to play around with magic in their games, it is very, very, very fun and inspirational.  I used someone else's copy for a while, but I simply had to buy one for myself so that I could access it whenever I wanted some quick inspiration on matters arcane.  I give it a strong personal recommendation.	2004-02-04

In mathematical terms, it is &quot;elegant.&quot;  It is a latter-day Occam's Razor cutting through generations of theories based upon individual cultures or isolated events to show that they could all have at their heart a single event which triggered, as the title says, global &quot;Catastrophe.&quot;  (Definitely with a capital &quot;C&quot;!)<br />Keys uses Chinese records to show that a loud bang was heard over hundreds of square miles around 535, and that this was followed by a fall of yellow ash.  Other records, from Japan and parts of modern Indonesia, support this occurence.  Keys, after weighing and rejecting alternative theories, suggests that only a massive volcanic eruption could be the culprit for the event recorded by the Chinese, and shows, decade by decade, using historical records, dendrochronological (tree ring) records, ice samples, and other measurements, that what happened was no ordinary eruption, but possibly the largest volcanic eruption in history, which darkened skies around the world, creating a &quot;volcanic winter&quot; which brought famine and plague in its wake.  Amazingly, he does it in plain, easy-to-read language, a hallmark of historiographic greatness.<br />Keys documents major climatic disruptions and uses established scientific models to project the impact of these changes on people as diverse as the Central Asian Avar and Turkish horse nomads, East African herdsmen, South American fishermen, and Anglo-Saxon and Britannic farmers in the modern British Isles.  His conclusion is stunning:  the eruption triggered waves of nomadic migrations which helped to bring about the decline of the recently revived Byzantine empire (which was well on its way to reconquering much of the old Roman Empire), destroyed flourishing urban cultures in the Americas, ruined the powerful Southern Arabian kingdoms which had existed for centuries (thus creating the power vacuum later filled by Mohammad's follwers), and also wrought devastation remembered in Arthurian romances.<br />One of the crucial contributions which Keys has made is an explanation of the otherwise unexplainable irruption of the bubonic plague out of Africa and into the Byzantine and Indian worlds.  The plague -- which spread as far as Britain and permanently ended any chance that an independent Celtic Church would be established, separate from Rome -- killed millions of then and former Romaions (inhabitants of the original Roman Empire) and blasted any hopes of re-establishing the Empire, relegating it instead into an ever-dwindling Greek-centered Eastern Empire, subject to nomadic incursions from Arabia and central Asia.<br />In the Americas, Teotihuacan and Tikal alike suffered from near-simultaneous climatic disruption which ended their civilizations -- contemporaneously with the decline of the great cities of the Classical Eurasian world.  Only the Keys Catastrophe theory explains BOTH phenomena -- the end of urban cultures in the Americas AND in Africa-Eurasia.<br />In east Asia, Keys blames the super-eruption for the famines whch led to the revolt of Hou Jing, which ended southern Chinese independence and led ultimately to the establishment of the Sui Dynasty and the near-continuous unification ofChina as a single cultural entity since then.  In 535, the very year which Keys gives for the eruption, the Korean state of Silla, probably faced with climatic turmoil and famine as bad as China's, abandoned its pagan past and adopted Buddhism, laying the groundwork for the unification of THAT country, too.  Again, no other theory provides a unified explanation for the near-simultaneous events.<br />The Keys theory is not without its weaknesses.  I have particular doubts about the Indonesian chronicles which he utilizes, but which, if authentic, indicate that the Sunda Strait is a relatively modern phenomenon, and, until 535-536, Java and Sumatra formed a super-island, dominated by an unfortuante civlization (called Holotan by the Chinese).  If the records Keys uses are correct, Holotan was destroyed (along with much of the island) by the super-eruption, putting it alongside Thera as a major cultural center destroyed by a single volcano.  Undeniably, however, major changes took place in Southeast Asia after 535, including the establishment of Proto-Cambodia and Proto-Thailand only one generation later, along with other, more diffuse civilizations, presumably filling the gap left by the vanished Holotan.<br />The Keys theory will likely be subject to much criticism in the years ahead, and further refinements, but it is already so well-established as a convenient explanation for the catastrophic events of the Sixth Century C.E. that anyone who wants to understand histories of the period being written nowadays simply MUST be familiar with &quot;Catastrophe.&quot;<br />I give &quot;Catastrophe&quot; Five Stars, the highest rating, for its historiographic significance, ease of reading, and current impact on historical thinking.	2004-02-04

The magickal masterpiece!	\\"Real Magic\\" by P.E.I. Bonewits (the only person to have been granted a degree in \\"Magic and Thaumaturgy\\" by the University of California) is the sine qua non of magickal handbooks for beginners, whether neophyte practicing mage or the scholarly outsider.  Bonewits is a philologist by training, explaining just what certain magical terms MEAN.  A \\"sorcerer,\\" for example, is some who divines the future or casts spells by casting \\"lots,\\" whether they be tarot cards, I Ching stalks, runes, or the Ummim and Thummim of the Levite priests -- that is the practice of \\"sortilege,\\" no matter what is being cast or who is doing the casting, woad-rubbed Druid or silk pantalooned spokesman of Jehovah shooting craps with sacred dice.<br />Oh, and about \\"the Druid thing\\" --  Bonewits is one.  He's a co-founder, in fact, of the New and Reformed Druids, which began as a collegiate rebellion against mandatory chapel attendance at one school.  Chapel attendance was mandatory, but no rule dared specify HOW students should worship, nor WHAT (nor WHOM) they should worship, so modern Druidism was born (along with many inebriated rituals with uisghebegh,  literally, \\"the water of life\\"), and it grew into a substantial and academically respected religious tradition of the modern world.  The scholarly work of Bonewits went far towards this development.<br />But nothing written by Bonewits for the laity is to be feared as too academically dry for a good read.  Au contraire!  Bonewits writes with good humor and self-effacement. He remarks, for instance, how the first edition's, \\"So you've decided that your mother-in-law has got to go\\" became the second edition's, \\"So you've decided that the local dictator has got to go....\\"  Thus begins one of the few actual spells Bonewits presents, his spell for anger and destruction.  (There's also a generic love/lust spell, too.)<br />One of the great strengths of Bonewits is that he does not present the high-falutin' chants and incantations and specifications that make the typical \\"Book of Shadows\\" seem more like a somewhat shady cookbook or electronic assembly handbook than a guide to the realm of the mysterious and arcane.  Stardust Wondermorning Skysong Raven (Wiccan High Priestess, 89th level, 2 month's experience in \\"The Craft\\") is going to be s.o.l. trying to find a collection of feel-good sing-along songs for the next Sabbat in \\"Real Magic,\\" because Bonewits sharply points out that any such collection is useless for anyone except the author or compositor (or someone closely bound to them);  magick is a PERSONAL matter, and Bonewits tries to teach his readers how to express their desires and CREATE THEIR OWN SPELLS.<br />Much of modern magickal literature and theory owes its origins to \\"Real Magic,\\" including the now-popular \\"colors of magic\\" theories of fantasy literature and pop wizardry.  (Forget \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" -- REAL magic is all about the colors, from infra-red to ultra-violet.  Yellow magick is magick dealing with intelligence, the intellect, divination, or any mantic art -- unless, presumably, blue suits your spells better for those purposes.  Bonewits's suggestion that indigo magick might be suited for spells involving the Angel NASA might have come in handy during most of the past decade!)  \\"Chaos magick\\" would probably not exist at all without Bonewits.  Behind its high-tech trappings and advanced physics theories lurks Bonewits and his decades-old idea that a \\"magic laser\\" would be a lot more effective for dealing with the old mother-in-law (er ... local dictator!) than a pin or a needle in a \\"voodoo doll.\\" And young Harry Potter should probably recognize P.E.I. Bonewits as his godfather ahead of that shaggy fellow in the fireplace -- it's all in the improvisation as \\"Real Magic\\" readers know.<br />An especially useful section for the Stardust Wondermorning Skysong Raven types of the world is Bonewits's guide to cults.  Beyond simply saying that they are bad, however, he presents a rating scaleof cult activities and beliefs which allows the reader to rate ANY organization for cult-like behavior.  Had this book been more widely available after its initial publication, Pat Robertson would today probably still be shilling immortality potions to geriatrics instead of presiding over the half billion dollar 700 Cult, whose adherents literally believe that Pat LITERALLY talks to God and gets (or, for all we know, GIVES) financial and election advice (fat lot of good that bit did HIM!).  Using the cult danger scale reveals that the Church of Satan or the average Wiccan coven is a lot less dangerous to a member's mental and physical well-being than several \\"respectable\\" churches which have churned out far more killers, rapists, mad bombers, and politicians per thousand members than the whole \\"New Age Conspiracy\\" put together.<br />\\"Real Magic\\" is the fruit of the higher education of P.E.I. Bonewits, and this book distils what would otherwise be AT LEAST a decade's pre-Internet study of magick into a single volume which can be read in a day.  And then re-read with enjoyment and (hopefully) further enlightenment many, many times thereafter.<br />Five stars -- an absolute MUST for any library of the occult or of magick.	2004-01-29

DMs.	Peter Spufford's highly detailed history of Medieval European money is an invaluable reference book for numismatists who want to know deep details of the coins they study, and for historians interested in the impact of trade, plunder, metal mining, and industry on the Medieval economy.  <br />Strangely, what I found it most useful for was as an aid to running fantasy role-playing games (e.g., Dungeons &amp; Dragons).  Spufford explains the impact of inflation in Medieval economies caused by the rapid influx of ready money (from the silver mines of Bohemia, for example), which would closely parallel the impact of a treasure hoard brought to a civilized community by fantasy adventurers.  <br />Likewise, Spufford deals with the shortage of precious metals and their impact on coinage:  debasement, depreciation, and depression, as &quot;white&quot; (silver) money gradually becomes &quot;black&quot; (base metal) coinage.  DMs could readily reduce the impact of inflation in their campaigns by having adventurers discover a hoard of debased coinage with only a limited amount of &quot;good&quot; gold and silver coins.  Rather than assuming that &quot;treasure types&quot; in monster hoards and lairs are good coinage all of the time, even a cursory study of &quot;Money and Its Uses&quot; should give the DM ideas for tossing in debased coinage. <br />Debased coins in hoards could, in turn, become adventure hooks if the player characters actually bother to study what they have found:  why, for example are the coins of King Poobah IV mostly lead mixed with a small amount of silver when his father, King Poobah III, issued sound coins of good silver?  Did something happen to cut off the silver supply?  Is there perhaps an orc-infested silver mine somewhere nearby?  As Spufford indicates -- primarily in relation to gold -- enemy action could off one state from its supply of precious metals in some other part of the world, enriching the enemy at the expense of the suddenly deprived state.  In a fantasy campaign, the enemy might well be orcs, a dragon, or a lich instead of Turks or Mongols.  On the other hand, a third state might well profit by trading with the first state's enemy.  (In The Forgotten Realms Campaign setting, imagine Calimshan suddenly boycotting Waterdeep to trade exclusively with Amn, and you have a parallel with the commercial rivalry of, for example, Venice and Genoa trying to snare trade with the Muslim East.)	2003-11-02

The titles are often a good guide to the character of the emperors, with stay-at-Rome sybarites with titles such as &quot;Gothicus&quot; and &quot;Germanicus&quot; revealed as vainglorious, while warrior emperors with the same titles are revealed as true veterans prepared to fight for the imperial purple.  One helpful feature is an explanation of the significance of the titles.  The actual word designating an emperor, for instance, was NOT &quot;Imperator,&quot; which was a military honor which could be won by any very succesful general, but &quot;Augustus,&quot; with &quot;Caesar&quot; gradually acquiring the meaning of &quot;heir apparent,&quot; with many a war fought over who should have which title.  (As an interesting historical aside, you may want to note that while &quot;Augustus&quot; eventually became a personal name, &quot;Caesar&quot; became an imperial title in later kingdoms:  both &quot;Tsar&quot; and &quot;Kaisar&quot; are actually derived from the name of the last dictator of the Republic, Gaius Julius Caesar, adoptive father of Octavian, who became the first &quot;Augustus&quot; and is usually designated by that title as if it were his proper name.)<br />The third good feature of the Chronicle is the same as in other books of the series:  a plethora of gorgeous photography of things from major architectural wonders to small handcrafts.<br />The one great inconvenience of the book is the editorial choice of where to place those photos:  they too often appear smack in the middle of an imperial biography, or separate the biographies of emperors whose lives should be studied together because of the interlocked details presented by Scarre.  This placement was an irritant to me when I tried to just read through the book for pleasure -- the pictures presented jarring interuptions mid-story.<br />Still and all, one can hardly do better than this for a broad survey of Imperial Rome.	2003-11-02

Hale was one of THE experts on the European Renaissance (literally writing the book on it -- for Time-Life).  That is what makes this book so confoundedly frustrating -- any indivual snippet from it is fascinating, because Hale was an excellent popular writer as well as a learned historian, but the field is so chronologically and geographically vast, covering all of Europe for several centuries, that Hale, in order to emphasize a particular point, throws together information from different countries and different times in the same narrative, sometimes even in the same paragraph.<br />As a &quot;good read&quot; the book is fine, until one starts getting caught up on the niggling suspicions that maybe Hale isn't exactly levelling with the reader 100% of the time.  Why is it necessary to bring up a fact from another country in another century so closely upon the heels of a particular statement?  Were there no contemporary examples which could have been cited?<br />Hale does a fine job of showing that the Renaissance was a universal European phenomenon, progressing at different rates in different countries, but what is less apparent is that when a bit of data from Northern Europe is brought in to bolster some bit of data from Italy, for example, which occured a century or more earlier, Italy was already in a different &quot;world&quot; than northern Europe at the time.  Even explaining the problem of Hale's melange is difficult: while Italy was experiencing its High Renaissance, northern Europe was still muddling through the Middle Ages; when northern Europe was experiencing Renaissance events which highlight and amplify the events which took place in Italy a century or more earlier, Italy was  well into the modern age and its Renaissance glories were cannon-blasted memories.<br />I repeat:  this book IS a good read.  What it is not, and should not by any means be considered, is a textbook or thorough history of the Reniassance.  Any student who tries to write a paper on the Renaissance from this book is going to be in for a big surprise at grade time if the teacher is even remotely savvy to history.<br />If one wants to follow a thread diligently, of course, one may go from citation to citation in the index, but that tends to defeat Hale's purpose of writing an entertaining book -- better by far to read some of Hale's &quot;serious&quot; monographs or refer to the footnotes and check the bibliography.<br />As a simple, relaxing reading experience, however, &quot;Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance&quot; is good brain candy for the intelligentsia, and for snagging a date with someone a cut above the intellectual average, it is much better beach reading than a Harold Robbins novel!write a paper on the Renaissance from this book is going to be in for a big surprise at grade time if the teacher is even remotely savvy to history.  <br />If one wants to follow a thread diligently, of course, one may go from citation to citation in the index, but that tends to defeat Hale's purpose of writing an entertaining book -- better by far to read some of Hale's &quot;serious&quot; monographs or refer to the footnotes and check the bibliography.  <br />As a simple, relaxing reading experience, however, &quot;Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance&quot; is good brain candy for the intelligentsia, and for snagging a date with someone a cut above the intellectual average, it is much better beach reading than a Harold Robbins novel!	2003-10-05

Although he was considered one of Britain's leading tank experts during and after the Great War, the British military rejected his thought on the importance of mobility, but the German General Staff followed his work closely.  The result was the Blitzkrieg, which destroyed the armies of Poland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Britain in less than a year.  <br />Here, however, in a collection of biographical essays written for popular journal readers, Liddell Hart shows himself as not being above gushing hack writing more typical of a teenager's fan magazine than a military history.  As another reviewer has pointed out, \\"Great Captains Unveiled\\" jumps about in its biographies.  It offers facts which might be interesting in the context of a major biographical work, but which are all but pointless in the brief biographies presented --  acceptable perhaps for a general readership, but unacceptable for those expecting information which explains WHY these particular individuals were chosen to be considered \\"Great Captains.\\"<br />The worst biography is probably that of Wolfe, victor at Quebec.  What difference does it make if he was delayed on this date or that date because he or someone else was sick?  The Battle of Quebec and his tactics were completely unaffected by his health (unlike, for example, General Rommel's psychosomatic illnesses, which seriously affected the course of the North African campaign and led to his disillusionment with Hitler and his own forced suicide, a series of events which unfolded after the publishing of this book, which Rommel might well have read, although he himself throve too late to be included).  The gushing tone is most obvious in the actual description of the \\"Battle\\" of Quebec, which seems to have boiled down to a sneak attack, one effective volley at close range which caused the French to panic, and a foolish French salley which cost both Wolfe and defender Montcalme their lives.  A perceptive reader might well get the impression that death was Wolfe's greatest ally:  had he lived he might well have shown himself to be as mediocre as most of his contemporaries -- one lucky volley does not a \\"Great Captain\\" make.<br />The acccount of the Mongol conquest of the Khwarezm Shah's empire, however, is very good indeed.  Although the casus belli is often repeated in histories of the Mongol conquests, few histories relate the unfolding of the events which led to the Mongol victory, nor so succinctly explain EXACTLY why this victory was more significant than any other Mongol victory in Central Asia.  The other Mongol victories get short shrift, but this book's account of the Central Asian campaign is outstanding.<br />The life of Wallenstein is covered in far greater detail in Friedrich Shiller's history of the Thirty Years War (available free online through Project Gutenberg and other web sites) than it is in \\"Great Captains Unveiled,\\" while the life of De Saxe is over-rated and inflated to highlight the importance of his \\"Reveries.\\"  I can't even remember who else was covered in this book, so trivialized are the biographies.<br />This is one book by Liddell Hart which bears missing.  The interested reader should merely note the names of those whose biographies he includes and look up their lives elsewhere, although, as stated, the account of the defeat of the Khwarezm Shah is outstanding.	2003-10-05

Is a dragon &quot;evil&quot; for defending a lair it has occupied for a thousand years before humanoid encroachment? -- Moral quandries to help a player (or DM) determine a character or creature's REAL alignment in light of their deeds, not their words.  <br />For those who are determined to pursue the course of evil for whatever reason (e.g., improper potty training followed by a decade of bullying from schoolmates who simply MUST have vengeance exacted against them!), &quot;Evil&quot; provides rules for making the ultimate commitment -- from swearing oneself to deities of Evil to forging pacts with demonic and diabolical powers willing to grant wealth, extended life, and power in exchange for ... the soul of the PC.  Gothic, philosophical, and pragmatic in its game applications, &quot;Evil&quot; is one of the best books from AEG (Alderac Entertainment Group), and a must read for anyone who wants to play an evil character, or for anyone who wants to truly understand the psychology of the evil character.  <br />(I will echo rarbelaez's review and say that the only reason *I* gave it four stars instead of five was because of typographical errors -- with beter proofreading it wouldbe five stars+.)<br />I rate this book highly and think that every gaming group should have access to at least one copy.

Long attributed to the Byzantine Emperor Maurice, the \\"Strategikon\\" became the practical handbook for Byzantine army organization, covering everything from basic training to tactical planning against the armies of different nations and to basic strategy and diplomacy. <br />A young Byzantine man of good birth was expected to learn from childhood how to use the bow, ride a horse, then do both, while also training to fight on foot with sword, and then train to do it all in armor, and be capable of making long rides or long marches in full kit before being deemed fully qualified for service in the army.  <br />Although heavily dependent upon mercenary forces, the Byzantines did not forget the lessons of the latter Western Roman Empire -- along with the mercenaries, the Byzantines established a hard core of well-trained native soldiers who acted as a unifying force around which the mercenaries gathered.  <br />The \\"Strategikon\\" gives detailed marching orders for a variety of column types, orders of battle, the fighting styles of different enemies of the Byzantines, etc.  It is this detail which helps the textual critics to analyze whether or not the Emperor Maurice himself wrote the book, or if it was written at his request, or under his dictation.  Whoever the author, it is undoubted that he was a skilled tactician and an experienced veteran officer of high rank.  In any case, \\"Strategikon\\" was for generations one of THE handbooks of military theory for the Byzantines, one which enabled them to maintain their independence (even in exile) for centuries after the book was written, and one which still has value for \\"Maurice's\\" comments on the need to train recruits thoroughly in ALL of the types of fighting which they might need to do.	2003-09-11
US	50919295	R1YJWU93RUFZQH	0786926554	204316990	Stronghold Builder's Guidebook (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)	Books	2	28	46	N	N	Heavily padded, like most 3rd Edition D&D books from WOTC	This book has the basics of \\"stronghold\\" construction, of course, and some of the rules are quite helpful, especially the advice on how and where to build a stronghold, and how and when to defend -- or attack! -- one.  However, instead of providing solid historical examples of REAL strongholds and ACTUAL sieges, the authors pad the book in the typical 3rd edition style favored by WOTC (\\"Wizards of the Coast\\" -- D&D's current publisher).  <br />For example, instead of saying that a spell is Reversible, as in 2nd edition, 3rd edition allows writers to simply rewrite the same basic paragraph over and over again.  Millions of 2nd edition players were expected to be able to figure out that a reversible ward, or protection, or barrier against (e.g., Evil, Chaos, etc.) would work against the opposite alignment if the spell was simply reversed. In 3rd edition, these are ALL separate spells, not just variations on a theme, so if a spellcaster can place a Protection From Evil spell on a wall, for instance, the 3rd edition writers have the opportunity to insert three nearly identical paragraphs into the same section for the spells Protection Against Good, Protection Against Law, Protection Against Chaos, etc.  <br />This cheating of readers (and especially buyers!) is carried on in the Stronghold Builder's Guidebook and amplified.  The writers, for example, describe a \\"Bedroom, Basic,\\" but don't add one or two sentences that \\"Fancy\\" and \\"Luxurious\\" variants take up this much extra space, cost this much extra gold, and need these staff members.  Instead, we are treated to a separate section on \\"Bedroom, Fancy,\\" and \\"Bedroom, Luxurious.\\"  ONCE might have been tolerable as an example, but this happens over and over again: we do not REALLY need, but the writers dump on us, repeated descriptions of \\"Basic,\\" \\"Fancy,\\" and \\"Luxurious\\" spaces in the stronghold for everything from bathrooms (despite the fact that, as the writers describe, the Medieval toilet was a \\"garderobe,\\" a room with a hole which allowed the human waste to fall outside the castle wall) to throne rooms.  ONE description of the difference between the three categories of space would have sufficed, but the reader must endure numerous repetitions of this type of room and that type of room as it ranges from a dirt floor with no staff member to one with marble floors and one or more servants.  <br />All of the space wasted by repetitions could have been used for additional information about (for example) ALL of the staff needed for the stronghold and detailed descriptions of what their jobs are, or the many different types of siege equipment which might be brought in and the best ways to defend against them (there is a website for amateur siege engine makers which DOES provide that information, though -- just in case someone attacks your own, mundane home with a catapult or trebuchet!).  <br />One area where there was a huge gap was the failure to establish the \\"Siege Engineer\\" as a prestige class (a gap filled by an article in \\"Dragon\\" magazine, which allowed the company to rake in even more money by filling a gap which they themselves had created).  <br />Another huge gap which this reviewer noticed was the description of the counter-siege: an encirclement of a besieging army by allies of those besieged in a stronghold; many times in history a besieging army has been driven off or destroyed by a counter-siege, but we're talking about PC's and NPC's here, and they deserve to be told (or reminded) that one of Julius Caesar's greatest victories was in a siege directed against the Gallic King Vercingetorix and the counter-siege laid around Caesar's army by the tribes allied to Vercingetorix; although caught between the hammer and the anvil, Caesar and his men defeated the allied force AND took Vercingetorix and his fortress -- just the sort of inspirational story a player needs to know of, even if it is rephrased in Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms terms.   <br />Still another huge failing is the lack of information about the realities of BEING a castellan -- how are the farmers treated?  Are they free peasants or serfs, or slaves?  Are the field workers marched off with the castellan's army when s/he goes off to wage war?  What is the appropriate tax level which a Lawful Good castellan may impose?  What about swearing fealty to the local Lord or Monarch?  Players interested in those details should skip this book and buy the game \\"Stronghold,\\" available for both the Mac and (broken) Windows.  At $4 or $5 --used -- this book isn't a bad buy (bearing in mind that the \\"Siege Engineer\\" and who knows what else were published separately in \\"Dragon\\").   Anyone who can afford to pay full price, however, should look instead at books on war and fighting published by AEG, Mongoose, and other D20 System publishers -- the information in their books is fully compatible with D&D, and THEY don't pad their books with endless repetitions (bad grammar and typos, maybe, but not endless repetitions!).	2003-09-11

Largely ignored by the British, his theories were put into practice by the German High Command, which was influenced by Liddell Hart in their plans for Blitzkrieg in WWII.  It wasn't until the North African Campaign, when O'Connor rolled backed Graziani's &quot;grey tide&quot; of Italians by rapid movement, capturing thousands of previously victorious Axis troops, that the British took Liddell Hart seriously enough to put his theories to use on the offensive.  When the Americans arrived, the Allies were ready to face Rommel, who had also steeped himself in Liddell Hart's theories.  The drama of the campaign in central North Africa is, in part, the drama of two sides using different versions of the author's theories.  In &quot;Strategy,&quot; we have the thoughts of the mature man, one who has seen that the atomic bomb can stop a rapid deployment in its tracks, and who realizes that the West's military superiority over the rest of the world will end with the proliferation of nuclear weapons.<br />Nuclear weapons are now available to frequent military rivals India and Pakistan (whose &quot;Islamic Bomb&quot; secrets were recently transmitted to other Muslim nations by one of the bomb's designers), and to North Korea -- which had fought the West to a bloody standstill in Liddell Hart's lifetime.  The old theories of rapid deployment which were the hallmark of Liddell Hart's earlier thought are STILL believed in by many military leaders, ready, as so often, to fight the LAST war over again.  Liddell Hart's too brief comments about war in the age of nuclear weapons are all the more important to us today, lest we find ourselves caught up in an unwinnable war because of poor strategy.  Liddell Hart's conclusions on &quot;industrial bombing&quot; were that it was NOT a useful means of warfare.  We may suggest, based upon very recent military experience, that today's aerial campaign of &quot;awe and terror&quot; rapidly lead's to tommorrow's &quot;guerrila war&quot; on the ground, down and dirty, and very, very bloody.<br />Liddell Hart's chapter on &quot;Guerilla War&quot; helps to illustrate the bloody catastrophes of the Viet Nam era and the current insurgency in Iraq.<br />&quot;Strategy&quot; is a bit out-of-date, but a wise reader can discern where Liddell Hart's theories WOULD have led had he lived a few years longer.  I rate &quot;Stragey&quot; 5 stars, up from my earlier rating of 4 stars, which I gave it before the Iraq &quot;insurgency&quot; showed that Basil Liddell Hart knew his stuff:  the war is unfolding as &quot;Strategy&quot; suggests that it would.  This book is A MUST READ for anyone interested in strategy, whether for playing war games or waging a real war.	2003-09-06

These old tomes can be like the adoption records so beloved of genealogists:  A stater from Afghanistan with a certain Mitchiner number and having such a condition and such a weight may have sold at a certain auction for so much money; another handwriting records that a coin of the same description sold for so much more money at THAT auction, and so on to the present day.

Page after page after hundreds of pages of beautifully photographed, crisply described coins make this a true pearl of great price for the serious student of ancient and classical coinages.

It is beautifuly illustrated, as well as informative, and makes the reader truly want to own the coins which Sayles discusses.  One thing which makes this better for new collectors than some other books, is that Sayles isn't touting ancient coins as an investment.  They are NOT a sound investment for the average collector, who can expect a 30% or higher LOSS when reselling the coins which most average collectors can afford to buy -- beautiful as they are, the typical coins which the average collector can afford are NOT going to shoot through the roof in value, even if they are extremely rare or unique.  The market strength and bullish demand isn't present to allow the average collector to profit from most of his or her coins.  What makes the Sayles book appealing is its inspiration for readers to COLLECT these coins and treasure them, as they have been treasured for thousands of years, and YES, it is thrilling indeed to buy a coin of which only two or three other specimens are known in the world, and -- YES! -- it is possible to own coins which are absolutely unique.  Thanks to generations of dedicated collectors, it is even possible to buy -- for small sums -- coins which have established provenances dating back a century or more.  My own collection includes coins once owned by President John Quincy Adams and by J. P. Morgan, but they each cost less than some best-selling potboiler novels which will be forgotten by next season.  Read Sayles and begin to dream!!!	2003-08-13

I would strongly advise that anyone interested in this book obtain the later edition.<br />That said, I have to also say that Harbottle's &quot;Dictionary of Battles&quot; is one of the handiest reference books ever written for anyone who needs to know a little bit about a whole lot of military history, such as the story of the Battle of Puebla which spawned the Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the United States and Mexico, or the role of the French fleet at the Battle of Yorktown.<br />Get the most recent, updated, revised edition which you can find.  Not only have new battles been added, but corrections and additions have been made to the text in reference to earlier battles.  My 3 star rating is for the 1975 edition; look for a newer one and you'll probably find it to be a 4 star addition to your reference library.	2003-05-29
US	50919295	R5C2VUAUI65EA	0786865520	748996162	Something Dangerous: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Excellent on all levels --  whatever its genre is!	Having spent the previous several weeks reading horror, thriller, and fantasy short stories, including the 1st edition version of \\"Frankenstein\\" and some other Gothics, I did not approach \\"Something Dangerous\\" with any great expectations.  I had chucked aside Henry James three times in the past couple of days, could not get into a Joyce Carol Oates book, and was generally bored with the whole genre.  Patrick Redmond shook me out of that ennui right quick!  <br />  I had obtained \\"Something Dangerous\\" because I liked the (hardback) cover art, but could not (willingly) put it down because of the gripping text. Laden with groceries, I would read a few pages at a time between busses and I ignored the inconvenience of lugging around the extra weight of a hardback because this was a book which, having hooked me, wasn't going to let me go.  Safely ensconced at home, I read the book to the end . . . at 3:30 in the morning.  <br />  Framed by a journalistic interview, a la \\"Interview With a Vampire,\\"  the main story seems to be a crime mystery set in a 1950s English public school, but the Rician framework proves to have been a good choice by Redmond, because this ain't your average mystery  --  it's not a thriller, exactly, either, and it certainly isn't a typical horror story although it has a lot of Gothic elements.  As the story unfolded, I got the feeling that the Abbey school was very likely the very one from which William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" boys had come . . . assuming that they had George and Martha (from \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\") as their role models!  Harry Potter wouldn't stand a chance at this school.  <br />  The supernatural element in the story is repressed, even more so than the homosexual element, but by the final paragraphs of the book I fairly well understood the revulsion of the fictional adults in the framing story to the boys in the main narrative  --  it was as if Redmond had told us an \\"X-File\\" from the point of view of one of the subjects of the investigation AFTER \\"the official version\\" of the narrated events had been released.  The \\"official version\\" paints the boys as \\"monsters\\" (metaphorically speaking), while the narrative and the conclusion strongly suggest that they were merely the instruments of something TRULY monstrous, something genuinely evil.    <br />  I have read the old stories of Harlan Ellison (in which \\"here there be monsters\\" refers to the twisted psychological make-up of American juvenile delinquents from the period just after that in which \\"Something Dangerous\\" is set), and found it disturbingly refreshing to read a book which hints that evil juveniles may be evil for reasons other than broken homes and unhappy childhoods.  <br />I recommended this book to two people within a day of finishing it.  I commend it to the attention of other readers, with the sole complaint that ... people are \\"hanged\\" not \\"hung\\"(unless they resemble certain motion picture stars who shall remain nameless here!).  Read \\"Something Dangerous\\" when you want a \\"can't put it down\\" thriller.	2000-12-04
US	50919295	R2HJLKX2GYYTBN	1560768770	208504971	Masque of the Red Death and Other Tales (AD&D 2nd Ed Roleplaying, Ravenloft, Expansion, 1103)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Gothic Earth adds spice to "steampunk" adventures	The Gothic Earth setting is by far the most realistic adventure setting from TSR in decades, but, as noted in another review, successful play requires a good knowledge of the late 19th century, its customs,  technology, etiquette, etc.  This is NOT beyond the scope of anything  required by any  \\"steampunk\\" RPG, such as \\"Space 1889\\"  or \\"Castle Falkenstein\\" or the \\"Cthulhu by Gaslight\\"  1890s campaign.  Any background research into \\"our\\" world which  has been done for any of those games is just as valid for Gothic Earth, and  this campaign setting should actually require less mental gymnastics than  \\"Falkenstein\\" or \\"1889.\\"       <br />The boxed set is VERY  nice, and the maps and illustrations are unexpectedly beautiful (in a  horrifically Gothic way, of course!), far above typical TSR standards, but  the presentation and background of \\"the Red Death\\" entity (Gothic  Earth's answer to the Voices of the Mists of Ravenloft) is rather feeble;  most skilled GM's could come up with something better as a house rule.  The  mini-module, \\"The Red Death,\\" which is included in the boxed set  is, however, a very different matter; based upon Poe's \\"Masque of the  Red Death,\\" I adapted it to a \\"Falkenstein\\" game (it would  have worked just as well in any other 19th century game) and shocked the  heck out of my players; it is so obviously based upon the Poe story,  however, that player knowledge can easily become a problem.      <br />By and  large, it's worth the price, and far less grim than Ravenloft itself.	2000-05-17
US	50919295	RRBWUYW9UHXS	0671698869	287097090	In the Country of the Blind	Books	3	13	14	N	N	Fascinating, thought-provoking . . . but where's the sequel?	Michael Flynn's &quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot; is set primarily in the present (ca. 1990, so some of its computer 'net lingo is remarkably dated after only ten years), with intriguing and illuminating flashbacks to  the 1800's.  The flashbacks are about a small group of idealists deciding  to utilize the theories of Charles Babbage, build Babbage Analytical  Engines and use mathematical models to chart the likely course of future  events, and  -- ultimately  --  to modify the undesirable outcome they  foresaw:  a United Germany armed with unimaginably powerful bombs in 1939.   To forestall this eventuality, the &quot;Charles Babbage Society&quot;  began taking an active part in history by engineering key historic events,  such as the permanent &quot;deletion&quot; of Abraham Lincoln from their  equations. . . .   Flash forward to the 20th Century when the novel's  heroine innocently stumbles upon century-old records of the group  --  and  evidence that they are still active  --  very, very, VERY active she learns  as she suddenly finds herself hunted by assassins and everyone she knows  begins disappearing or dying as the heirs of the Society strive to preserve  the Secret that for more than a century they have engineered wars and  assasinations and negative social trends for what seems to be their own  advantage.   This is a very intellectually stimulating book (as well as a  fair thriller) and a good steampunk adventure, but the ending is acutely  disappointing.  Without spoiling the ending, suffice it to say that it is  abrupt and MANY sub-plots (literally!) are left unresolved.  &quot;In the  Country of the Blind&quot; cries out for republication (the Ayn Rand-like  philosophical discussions about history, politics, and the control of  society are FAR more relevant today than they were even ten years ago) and  the book really needs a sequel to tie up its loose ends and bring the  discussions of the major characters to bear upon themes which proved to besadly prophetic.	2000-02-11

By the third time it was much clearer and the utter demoniac cruelty of The Voices which had tormented Azalin for centuries became horribly poignant as they obliged him to sow the seeds of his own, his  brother's, and his son's destruction.  <br />DeWeese's comparison of Azalin's  opinion of himself with other liches is telling -- evil though he is,  Azalin still has that awful Lawful streak in him which causes him to rank  himself above other liches who are greater wizards (or scientists) than he,  merely because they seek knowledge and not power.  One might say that all  Azalin really needs is to get in touch with his inner child, but that is  one experiment one hopes that he doesn't try undertaking again!<br />Paired  with the first book of Azalin's story, King of the Dead, Lord of the  Necropolis makes for a moving tale of sympathy for a monster.  Together  they are not exactly &quot;Notre Dame de Paris,&quot; but who today has the  time to read fifty pages of a book before coming to its anti-hero (besides  which, the hunchback bell-ringer of Ravenloft is featured in &quot;Tower of  Doom&quot;!).  DeWeese's tales of Azalin's pathetic existence are quite  acceptable to me.	1999-11-08

Rather, he is an exceedingly complex character whose  hubris is matched only by his damnably Lawful sense of absolute duty (a  personality flaw in almost all of the worst rulers of Ravenloft  domains).<br />By the time the book is over (although it continues -- even  more poignantly -- in &quot;Lord of the Necropolis&quot;), one is almost  tempted to weep for poor Azalin, who we learn, isn't even  &quot;Azalin&quot; by name -- he is a man (?) who has lost even his own  identity in his efforts to be as rigid as steel, a fault which the Powers  of Ravenloft use against him, imposing on him rules even more tortuous than  those which he imposes on others.  The suffering of (most of) Azalin's  victim's eventually ends; his never does.<br />The Ravenloft campaign setting features &quot;domains&quot; ruled by evil lords.  DeWeese shows us one of them in greater detail than any other, even Strahd the vampire lord.  Azalin's struggles are against Strahd, whom Azalin believes can free him from the doom which he has brought upon himself and his family and his realm, and against the mysterious Powers which actually rule Ravenloft, torturing the lords of the domains in their own private mental hells are poignantly drawn, and Azalin's frustration and his tortured madness resonate through this novel.  &quot;King of the Dead&quot; is a valuable addition to anyone's library of Ravenloft books, but it also makes a good read for anyone interested in a book which examines the tortured soul of a man who is doomed to do what he thinks is&quot;good,&quot; only to have horrible consequences arise from his every deed.  Azalin never wanted to be evil, but he is the victim of a terrible fate, and &quot;King of the Dead&quot; shows us his unfolding doom....	1999-11-08

Author Steve Kurtz went out of his way to find fictional examples of the various types of Necromantic Kits, and since most of them are from such stellar writers as Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, H.P. Lovecraft, and Clark  Ashton Smith, this book -- or at least the kit descriptions -- is an  excellent introduction to the literary genre of the Necromancer.  The one  glaring ommision was the failure to mention Robert Louis Stevenson's  &quot;The Body Snatcher,&quot; about the 19th Century &quot;Resurrection  Men&quot; who stole (and sometimes CREATED) corpses for medical students;  also missing were such creepy types as Burke &amp; Hare, and Dr. Knox.   (&quot;Down the close and up the stair/But and been with Burke and  Hare/Burke's the butcher, Hare's the thief/Knox the man that buys the  beef!&quot;)  And let's not forget Sweeney Todd and those delicious meat  pies Mrs. Lovett made!	1999-05-27
