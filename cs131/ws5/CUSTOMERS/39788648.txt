Still, I am learning from it for my current job. Would recommend it to any person in a managerial position who was raised to believe you should not do upon others what you do not wish to have done to you. That sort of upbringing does not go well with corporate environment. If that is your case (too), you NEED this book, and a number of others, to learn what your parents failed to teach you.	2005-09-30

Books	3	5	6	N	N	slightly disappointing	While i like HN work and always pick out his style even if i dont know a particular photograph, this book was downright disappointing. Its like someone assembled pictures which weren't good enough to be included in any of the other (previous) books just to sell it to suckers who will buy anything by HN.

However, exactly BECAUSE I dont know the scripture, there is no way for me to say whether this man is legit with his knowledge of the subject, or he is ranting.<br /><br />What stroke me at the end of reading this book is the fact that the Bible has been translated and retranslated so many times that it could be completely inaccurate! How to I come to that conclusion? 59th question, as an example. Did Paul's thorn in the body come from Satan? OK, now I am reading the book in Croatian. It says \\"trn u tijelu\\" meaning \\"thorn in the body\\". I have no idea what english book says. However, the latin translation says \\"stimulus carnis\\", which would, according to my limited knowledge of latin mean \\"stimulus to the flesh\\", or something that bothers the flesh. Got translated as \\"thorn\\", probably in wanting to make it \\"simple\\" for the simple folk of centuries before ours. But God only knows what was really bothering Paul! As a Christian, I am not strangthened in faith knowing that the Bible might be all wrong cause we messed it all up in translation..	2005-09-05

So I got this book. Daily meditations are indeed in line with all learned in the book, they are sort of daily reminders of all the little things we did wrong and all the things we need to change about US, but actually meditating on these, reading one per day seemed so corny. So I flipped thru it randomly and read several at one time until I would get tired, and then come back to it some other time. It might have worked better if I used it as prescribed, but I was too screwed up at the time. Unfortunately. For closing, here is one of my favorites: \\"We are certain that if we show someone how much we love him, no matter how he treats us, he will change. What we are really showing him is that it is safe for him to remain the same\\". Boy, was I champion of this particular mistake!	2005-07-05

Living an existence in which we are painfully aware that something is missing, we seek and use romantic love as a way to feel like we \\"belong\\".

Taught me most about wide range of subjects directly and indirectly used by various wicca/pagan/witchcraft groups, like moon phases, chakras, colors and various others magickal correcpondences. I like Silver's writing style too. She makes magick close and acceptable and not as macabre as some might want us to believe. Excellent book, thumbs up from me.	2005-02-19

Throat friction, the most basic techinique all else is based on, for instance. In order to know how it is done properly, and if i am doing it right, i would need to HEAR it. I found that most frustrating, so i finished reading the book without really doing the exercises. Therefore i cannot tell you if it works or not. Full of very interesting views and theories thou.	2005-02-19

What he told me of it is that, just as The Art of War, this is the book from which you take out whatever you want. What you find in it depends as much on the book as it does on you. It speaks of love, life and people in the most touching way ever. I have it in my handbag at all times. When I first read it, I cried. There is literally something mystical about it. I like to think I took a lot out of it. One of those books you should read again and again and again..	2005-02-03
