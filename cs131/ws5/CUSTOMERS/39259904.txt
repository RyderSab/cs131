They are really for the intermediate level paperfolder who has mastered the techniques of inside and outside reverse folds along with some squashing and collapsing techniques and who can fold reasonably accurately.<br /><br />There are no photographs of finished models, but the computerised diagrams are clear and the models are attractive when made up.  This would make a nice gift and anyone who enjoys Montroll's work will like the book.	2005-10-11

This is another collection of delightful boxes which includes my favourite octagonal design.  She shows you in this book how to work the same design so that it has five, six, seven or eight sides as you wish and how to make suitable bases which will always fit your box.  There is a nice variety of designs including simple little \\"docking boxes\\".<br /><br />Miss Fuse's boxes often look quite delicate but aren't at all - considering they are made from several sheets of paper slotted together they are remarkably strong and I have had a number on my desk at work acting as receptacles for various items for some years without mishap.<br /><br />Care is required in the folding and the boxes are not for the complete beginner.  Anyone starting to make them should at least have mastered the basic models in any beginner's book and then the boxes will be relatively easy though that final sheet is always fiddly to maneouvre into place.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys origami as I have come back to it again and again over several years and still enjoy folding from it.	2005-10-09

It contains an attractive collection of geometric style models such as unusual little boxes, vases and abstract decorations for placing around your home.  There is also a collection of items such as chopstick holders and various kinds of stationery and envelopes.  There is even a delightful collection of stars and snowflakes which would be wonderful for the festive season in making decorations and cards.<br /><br />As always in Tomoko Fuse's books, there is a sumptuous gallery of photographs of made-up models showing off the items for which instructions are provided in the book.  Each set of diagrams is done in the clear Randlett/Yoshizawa style and is accompanied by either a drawing or a black and white photograph of the object you are making.<br /><br />Care and accuracy is required in folding any of the models but all should be within the reach of the intermediate paperfolder.  I recommend this one unreservedly.	2005-10-09

As always Miss Fuse's boxes are beautifully finished both inside and out and choosing the correct paper can add a great deal to the quality of the finished product.<br /><br />These little boxes consist of a number of sheets of paper slotted together to form each part and some are really not that easy to do.  The flower box and some of the other decorative tops are quite tricky to figure out and absolute accuracy is required in the folding.  Having said this I have made most of the boxes in the book and the instructions are in Miss Fuse's clear and easy to follow style.  All of the boxes are made up and photographed clearly in the book, both in a separate sumptuous gallery section and in black and white photographs alongside the instructions.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for a complete beginner but someone who has done some folding and has mastered the basic models should be able to manage and enjoy making most of the items in it.	2005-10-09

Most will take a minimum of 2-3 hours each to fold and will require large squares of fine weight foil, preferably Japan type, for initial practice pieces.  The computerised diagrams are clear and concise and accurately drawn, though the models are advanced and will require some folding experience even to begin to attempt the techniques involved.<br /><br />I enjoyed the grasshopper in particular and have made it several times.  Writing this review has made me want to go and fold it again!<br /><br />This book is a must for any paperfolder and is one you will come back to again and again.	2005-09-29

These range from sea urchins and starfish through to the Blackdevil Angler Fish and the almost impossible to fold Chambered Nautilus Shell.  I have in my time folded most of the models and my favourites include the Angler Fish, Goldfish and the Murex shell which is wonderful in a textured foil.<br /><br />Most of the models will require some folding experience, even the easier ones and the most difficult ones like the Atlantic Purple Sea Urchin and Blackdevil Angler Fish are really for experts only, but most folders of intermediate level and upwards will find something to enjoy.  It is definitely a book which will help you to develop your folding skills but be sure to have plenty of paper on hand!<br /><br />Each section includes an interesting introduction to the natural history of the life forms it is covering and the book is well laid out with clear computerised diagrams.  It's an origami book I've come back to again and again over the years and which remains one of my treasures.  I recommend it.	2005-09-29

I am not particularly happy at the cover illustration of the book which is very misleading.  The collar design illustrated appeared in several reprints of a public domain tatting pattern in the 40s through to the 1980s and while the lace actually does look as if it's tatted it isn't, the piece is entirely made in beads.<br /><br />In my view the author would have been better not to make her lace a means of copying tatting patterns for those who can do beadwork but don't do tatting.  She would have been better to find ways of giving it its own look and style and staying away from the tatting altogether.  She seems to have had access to very few tatting books and while the ones she had are excellent ones (they are listed in the bibliography) a little more research would have been a good idea.<br /><br />That said the book is clear and concise in its layout though there are very few patterns and the actual sizes of the beads don't appear to be given.  This annoys me because you can see quite clearly in some of the photos that the beads are different sizes and this is going to make some of the pieces difficult to make up accurately.  The diagrams are however very clear and appear to be accurate though I haven't tried making any of the pieces.<br /><br />I would recommend this to a beadworker who has made some pieces and has some idea of what he or she is doing, and who would enjoy something which in beading terms does look a little different.  Don't buy it if you want to learn beaded tatting because it does not teach that skill.	2005-09-29

The boxes are a delight to make though they do require care and accuracy in the folding and must be made from accurately cut sheets of paper.  All of the pieces displayed in the book produce attractive results though some do take more time than others.<br /><br />I find that Tomoko Fuse boxes once made are excellent for display as well as being great for practical purposes.  I currently have several of these boxes on my desk at work acting as receptacles for doctors' dictation tapes and paper clips (what's more they have been there for several years and are still in good shape), and they make great gifts as well.<br /><br />This is a lovely book which will suit the folder who has mastered the basics of origami and is ready to move into intermediate level work.  I still come back to it occasionally even several years after having purchased my copy and always enjoy folding the pieces in it.	2005-09-28

Most of the pieces will not be possible from ordinary paper but will require either foil or very thin bank weight paper to work well.  Wet folding would also be suitable for some of the models though the diagrams for the elephant sail into a patch of fog when making its behind!<br /><br />Be prepared to spend some hours making each piece and you may well find yourself starting over again several times until a series of folding procedures becomes clear.<br /><br />That said the book contains some excellent models - I have always liked the Cuckoo Clock and the Viking Ship, and can confirm that the action pieces really do work.<br /><br />The diagrams are hand drawn rather than computerised which may explain the level of verbal instruction; however some of the sets of folds are very complex and the verbal instructions provide that much needed extra to understand what is going on.<br /><br />This is a book for the seasoned folder and most paper folders who have reached the high intermediate to advanced skill level will enjoy it.	2005-09-27

Robert Lang is known for producing complex origami models and here he teaches the mathematical thought process behind the creation of these pieces.  The book contains a number of chapters covering different methods of producing particular types of origami works and then each chapter ends with a series of advanced origami models for you to make with complete diagrammatical instructions.<br /><br />The book is a wonderful instruction manual on how to create original origami designs but it also includes many sets of instructions for origami models which have never before been published.  The exquisite Koi carp on the front cover (which I have seen in real life) is included as is the frog, and the infamous Black Forest Cuckoo Clock instructions are included at the end of the book.  Don't try to make these pieces with ordinary paper - you will want to use very fine bank weight paper, tissue foil or wet folding with Canson or Elephant Hide paper to get good results.<br /><br />This volume is an essential addition to any paperfolder's bookshelf and will provide many hours of interesting reading and wonderful models to fold.	2005-09-27

Models are grouped into chapters covering the different origami models with a range of easy pieces which will give the beginner plenty of practice with basic folds and techniques.  The finished results are attractive and in some cases downright exciting - the Steve Biddle Father Christmas is one of my favourite models.  I also like the Kawahata pteranodon.<br /><br />The book progresses towards more advanced work which is nevertheless produced in the characteristic clear style of the books by Steve and Megumi Biddle.  They use standard diagrammatic language so that once you have learned from this book you will be able to pick up most other origami books and work from them.<br /><br />In addition, once you have made all the models in the book you will be an intermediate level folder and ready for more advanced challenges!<br /><br />I recommend this book which will make a great gift, but be sure to provide some paper with it as it does not include a pack of origami paper the way some beginners books do.	2005-09-14

This particular example is in softback but the book has been produced on quality paper with heavy card for the covers.<br /><br />The book kicks off with a sumptuous gallery containing illustrations of some more modern pieces from the 1990s.  Mr Beech then provides some of the best instructions I have seen for creating your own duo papers, and provides some instructions also on how to work some of the sequences of folds which appear in the models.<br /><br />Although the book starts with a series of relatively simple models it very quickly progresses to models which would be classed in a convention as high intermediate, including pieces such as Enomoto's Elephant and Adolpho Cerceda's wonderful Peacock.  I would therefore regard it as suitable for someone who has done origami before and would like to progress into slightly more advanced work.<br /><br />Rick Beech is an excellent teacher and his selection of models will keep most people happy for some time.	2005-09-10

Some can be worked in ordinary origami paper but many require very large sheets and I remember one year cutting a 20 inch equilateral triangle of foil for the Christmas Tree Fairy which in fact produced quite a small figure about six inches high!<br /><br />This is therefore not a book for the beginner but it is certainly one which should be on any origami enthusiast's bookshelf.  Models range from Mr Brill's Ship in a Bottle and the Lidded Box, to the Cigarettes in a Box and other geometric forms.  There is also a whole variety of folds which are used in scenes in the photographs.  These include St George and the Dragon and a wonderful Santa in a sleigh complete with reindeer!	2005-09-08

Some of the patterns included split the diamonds down the middle which further increases the complexity of the pieces - and the workmanship in the sample quilts is superb.<br /><br />There is a large gallery of different quilts, many of which use very brightly coloured fabrics.  I don't greatly care for the way very busy fabric prints are used in some of the pieces both in the gallery and in the pattern section.  I feel that the busy floral prints obscure the intricate designs which are beautifully pieced and finished.  Don't expect a lot of large bed quilt patterns either - although the quilts could be laid on top of a bed the average size of the completed patterns is 50 inches square.<br /><br />Fabric selection and design is also discussed and there is a selection of different templates to help you begin creating your own original Lone Star quilt layout.<br /><br />This is not a book for the beginner.  The quilt patterns are pieces for the advanced worker who knows what she is doing.  However it provides plenty of inspiration for the experienced quilter.	2005-08-26

The instructions would be barely enough to get a beginner going as they are written in text with no how to illustrations, but they are of the most basic and quite old fashioned, requiring you to use templates to cut out each piece individually with scissors.  Only the briefest detail is given on how to machine piece and how to hand piece using a running stitch and the final instructions for binding the quilts with four separate pieces of fabric, one for each side, added on consecutively, were never good practice at any time in the history of quiltmaking.  The variety of patterns is quite good but unfortunately there are some eight pointed star blocks including Lemoyne Star which have been drawn incorrectly as four patch blocks.<br /><br />There are no pictures of finished quilts, even hand drawn.  This book was written in the days before everybody had computers and although the illustrations of the blocks are good and clear what you get is instructions for 27 quilts all exactly the same size, with the same size border and the same block layout and no consideration given for the different kinds of patterns included in the book.<br /><br />Compared with the quality of today's quilt books I think Dover should consider withdrawing this one as it doesn't hold a candle to most of the quilt pattern books available today or indeed others they published around the same time as this one.<br /><br />I would recommend that any beginner considering a new book avoid this one and consider perhaps Lynne Edwards's Sampler Quilt series and perhaps one of the Jinny Beyer books, which will give plenty of information and lots of patterns, and which are well illustrated and beautifully produced with clear illustrations of work in progress, patterns and finished quilt galleries.alleries.	2005-08-24

Patterns include the wonderful doily shown on the front cover which is almost entirely worked in the mignonette or ring only style, some exquisite baby bonnets, and a range of edgings and motifs, medallions, coasters, and doilies which is too numerous to list in detail here.<br /><br />The tatting is in the traditional style and few if any of the patterns make use of Ann Orr's invention the split ring (she calls it a reverse ring).  However the split ring and other modern techniques could definitely be incorporated into the patterns shown here which would be easy to adapt accordingly.<br /><br />Patterns as others have said are in written longhand and some of the instructions are quite old fashioned; for example in one of the christening bonnets the instruction is given for a ring of 9 long picots instead of the modern style of writing which would be 1 DS, 9 P separated by 1 DS, 1 DS, close ring.  In many patterns in this book the word Turn is used instead of the more modern instruction to Reverse Work.  There are no diagrams and although basic tatting instructions are included I would regard this as a book which the confident beginner would enjoy rather than for someone who has never tatted before.<br /><br />However it's very good value for money and will provide lasting enjoyment on your tatting bookshelf.

This particular volume concentrates mainly on luncheon sets, some of which have very large centrepieces.  Unfortunately the photograph of one luncheon set is not good and others are rather on the small side so that it is difficult to see what goes where. <br /> <br />Accompanying the luncheon sets is a range of edgings, one of which includes what is possibly the first in print appearance of the split ring.  For some reason the 1940 edition of the book, of which this is the reprint, did not include the knotted picots technique and so the pattern which included this rather unusual precursor to the self closing mock ring does not appear in the reprint which is rather a shame. <br /> <br />There is also a good collection of motifs and medallions some of which would make attractive small coasters or Christmas tree decorations. <br /> <br />The instructions are written in the longhand style of their time which can be a little difficult to decipher, however careful study before you begin will help you to understand how each piece works.  It will certainly be possible to adapt the patterns to use modern techniques such as split rings and chains and no doubt the author would be delighted to see her reverse ring technique being incorporated into her designs in this way.  A couple of the edgings do use the split ring and it's fun to see the way Ms Orr wrote out the pattern to use this technique which at that time was completely new and original and which she invented. <br /> <br />This book is a worthwhile addition to any tatter's bookshelf and will provide plenty of attractive patterns to work.	2005-08-06

Much of the time Helen wrote in a way that you would not realise she could neither see nor hear anything around her.<br /><br />The fact that Miss Keller was not deaf from birth but became deafblind as a very small child following an illness makes her achievements particularly incredible.  She had to re-learn her communication skills and this is due in no small part to her teacher and mentor, Annie Sullivan.  Miss Keller came from a wealthy family who were prepared to go to endless lengths to help their daughter to live a fulfilling life, and it is thanks to them and to Miss Sullivan that we have Miss Keller's writings and pioneering work for deaf and deafblind people.<br /><br />This is an incredible book to read and it also provides some interesting cameos of some of the people Miss Keller met (such as Mark Twain) because her letters are included at the end.	2005-08-05

It would make an ideal small gift for a child or for someone who collects bears and soft toys as it's beautifully produced and well photographed.<br /><br />The bears photographed are a mixture of modern and older toys, and have been set up in a variety of scenes such as hanging up the washing or decorating a vase of flowers.<br /><br />The quotes include the usual one from Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" and other sources and the book will make an enjoyable addition to the bear lover's bookshelf.	2005-08-05

The Introduction is an essential read as it contains many helpful hints and tips, and the introductions to each section and accompanying text describing each of the patterns also contain a lot of valuable information.<br /><br />I do have concerns about the two Dura Europos patterns - these are probably not originally  knitted but made using a technique known as sprang.  However it's an interesting interpretation and Ms Walker's knitting pattern versions are worth attempting as the end result is attractive and coherent.<br /><br />Unfortunately some of the colour photographs are not very pleasing to look at but they were taken in the 1970s so the colour combinations and yarns chosen reflect that.  However the black and white photographs of the stitches are extremely clear and provide good detail, showing every stitch of the patterns.<br /><br />I regard this wonderful collection of patterns as an essential, whether it's for designing and making your own garments or as a reference tool in deciphering a mistake or a printed pattern which is not clear.  Browsing through it to look at the different stitches and choose different ways of working some of them is as interesting as actually knitting the designs.	2005-08-05

The author begins with basic instructions on how to tat and then provides a series of edging patterns on which to practise.  However the book is not for the beginner and the instructions very quickly move to more advanced work with a series of patterns at intermediate to advanced level which include an angel and a large butterfly.  The author uses the needle as if it is a shuttle in order that she can place strands of beads and take the thread through spaces that are too small for a shuttle.<br /><br />The book contains patterns for a series of flowers including roses, fuchsias and pansies, the petals of which are formed by a variety of long picot techniques.  There are also some very imaginative fantasy fish and butterfly patterns and because the individual tatter's tension is acutely important in determining the final shape of the piece no two items will be the same even if worked to the same pattern.  The pieces are often worked in many different colours and high quality colour photographs are provided.  However these are placed far apart from the actual text of the pattern so it can be quite difficult to work out which pattern goes with which textual entry.<br /><br />The author does not provide details of the type of thread she uses in these flowers and other items but it is evident looking at the photos that the thread used is quite fine, probably Special Dentelles 80 or similar, since this thread was until recently available in many variegated and solid colours and is very suitable for tatting despite being very fine.  A single strand of embroidery floss, or the Altin Basak 70 thread would make a good substitute.<br /><br />The patterns in this book will require careful study before starting work but the end results will repay your efforts.  This is a book which will provide many years of enjoyment whether browsing through it or attempting to make one of the pieces in it.	2005-07-30

There are dozens of patterns all photographed in black and white.  Most of the photographs are clear and it will be possible to reproduce the illustrated items quite easily provided you make a careful study of the instructions.  The pictures are not always well arranged in relation to the text so you might want to photocopy the picture and text and paste them together if you are working a pattern in the book where the illustration and text have been separated.<br /><br />Dover have not made any attempt to edit or correct the patterns which are reproduced in their original longhand format with no diagrams whatsoever.  The usual basic instructions on how to tat are included but if you're a beginner wanting to learn how you would do better to buy this book for a good selection of patterns, and add a good techniques book such as The Complete Book of Tatting by Rebecca Jones.<br /><br />The designs are pretty and some are very imaginative including some wonderful bags, elaborate beaded necklaces and flowers and large centrepieces and cloths.  Most tatters will enjoy this book and it will remain an important part of any library of tatting books.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this too highly as a reprint of one of the most important volumes of tatting patterns produced during the 20th century.	2005-07-29

It has an amazing collection of different techniques many of which have been further developed in other books.  There are some superb black and white photographs illustrating the patterns but it can be difficult to work out which illustration in the photographs is referring to which pattern.  However the black and white typed illustrations (remember this book was written in the days before most people had computers) work well and the accompanying text gives clear instructions for each pattern in the book.<br /><br />This is one that will remain a treasure on my beadwork bookshelf for many years to come.	2005-07-29

It does not teach the 19th century method of tatting with needles which basically uses the needle as if it is a shuttle, but the method of forming double stitches on the tatting needle and pulling the needle through the stitches.  Special needles are required for this lace which can be obtained from the author's online tatting lace shop, which is heavily promoted in the book.<br /><br />The instructions provided are very clear and profusely illustrated with many photographs of the lace being worked.  There are few patterns and those which are included have been carefully chosen to teach the beginner essential techniques which are covered in the book.  These include how to make the double stitch, form a true ring, how to form what is now called the self closing mock ring, how to make joins using the tatting needle (the methods taught are different from those used in shuttle tatting), how to make chains, how to finish ends, how to join in new threads and how to do two colour work.  I am a little concerned at the introduction of new, trademarked terminology to describe some of these techniques as this confuses many beginners who join the online tatting mailing lists and groups.<br /><br />The book could have included more patterns and most people will master the techniques covered very quickly.  This book therefore may not prove to be a lasting reference work but it's a good introduction to the art of tatting lace using a tatting needle and can be recommended for this purpose.	2005-07-29

It contains a large selection of patterns ranging from motifs which can be built into large cloths, to doilies, bookmarks, and a collection of fragment designs intended for use as small decorations.  There is also a superb collection of edgings and insertions.  Some of the patterns use very unusual techniques such as freehand tatting and filet tatting.  There is some tatting with beads but for the most part Mary Konior concentrated on a range of techniques which included pearl tatting and traditional ring, chain and mignonette work.  The designs are crisp and clean and work up well.<br /><br />At the time the book was written diagrammatical pattern writing was coming into its own, but many people still did not have computers so the patterns are hand drawn.  That said they are amazingly clear and well laid out so that text is not really required at all.<br /><br />The book is not aimed at the beginner but at the lacemaker who has learned to tat and wants an interesting selection of patterns to make.  This will be a real treasure on your bookshelf.	2005-07-29

The workmanship is quite exquisite and these little quilts really are miniature replicas of full sized quilts.<br /><br />The book contains patterns for 17 miniature quilts.  The techniques used range from Hawaiian applique and traditional applique methods to Grandmother's Flower Garden using the English paper piecing method and even a delightful little Yo-yo quilt.<br /><br />This book is not aimed at the beginner but at the quilter who understands how patchwork and applique quilts are made and planned and how to choose fabrics.  Some suggestions are made at the beginning for finishing techniques and there are some general basic instructions but most of the quilts are complex enough that you will need to know what you are doing before you start.<br /><br />That said it's a delightful book, beautifully photographed, which will grace any patchworker's shelves even if used purely as eye candy.  And you never know when you will need to make that special quilt for a special doll!	2005-07-28

The book includes both hand and machine pieced techniques and the gallery photos show pictures of quilts made from beginners in Lynne Edwards's classes.  This is a feature I like because not only does it show what the quilts look like when made by relatively experienced workers, it shows that the quilt can be made by someone who is new to quiltmaking and also gives you some idea of how the blocks look in different colourways.<br /><br />This is a book that is enjoyable to look at as well as to work from and can be recommended to anyone looking for a clear, comprehensive manual of quiltmaking techniques.	2005-07-01

The original was in Swedish but the translation to English is excellent and there are no difficulties in understanding the requirements of each pattern.<br /><br />It contains a good introduction to the history of tatting which culminates in pictures of some of the most exquisite tatted lace handkerchiefs I have ever seen.<br /><br />I do not consider this to be a book for the complete beginner.  Many of the patterns are more complex than someone who has never tatted before would be able to manage.  The instructions provided on how to tat are extremely brief and you're really better off with a good techniques book such as Rebecca Jones's Complete Book of Tatting if you've never tatted before.<br /><br />I would still say buy this and keep it for later on though because it's a super book.  Over the years I have made most of the patterns in it, apart from the Ace of Hearts doily the instructions are accurate and the patterns look as illustrated in the photographs when made up.<br /><br />The collection of patterns is quite delightful.  We start off with a collection of edgings including some two shuttle work which at the time this book was published was not usually found in any tatting publication. Next the collection of motifs includes some lovely stars and flowers with which to create a mobile.  However the patterns could be used for almost any purpose and you don't have to use them for mobiles.  There is a collection of simpler designs which include my all time favourite pattern, the large cross pattern, which I have made on many occasions as gifts.  Finally there is a wonderful collection of intermediate to advanced doily designs and three tatted bridal crowns finish the book off.<br /><br />The patterns are written in notational format with absolutely no diagrams at all but the photographs are clear enough that  you won't need diagrams.  Most patterns are accurate apart from the Ace of Hearts Doily and even it can be made following careful study of the photograph.
