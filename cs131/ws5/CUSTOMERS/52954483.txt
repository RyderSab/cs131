As always, T.M. Wright is at the top of his game.  This book puts you in a trance with it's smooth prose and mysterious imagery.  T.M. Wright makes the reader work.  And the more you work, the more you uncover.  I loved everything about it.  In a market where horror writers try to top each other with violence and gore, T.M. uses his incredible skills as a wordsmith and storyteller to stand out.  In time, at least within the intelligent horror community, T.M. Wright will always be known as one of horror's pioneers and the most original and effective ghost story writer in history.  Without question, The Eye's of the Carp deserves the Bram Stoker award.	2005-10-13

While Bentley Little's Novella is easily the most original, fun, and scary of the bunch, Christopher Golden gets the runner up.  Tom Piccirilli, as usual, has the best writing, but his story and style doesn't seem to fit with the others in this collection.  Simon Clark or Scott Nicholson would have been a better choice to fit in.  Finally, Douglas Clegg's \\"The Words\\", was my least favorite, rehashing old themes from Lovecraft.  Clegg is a solid writer, but whenever he goes into his abstract prose, it just becomes clumsy and confusing.  Still, this book is definitely worth reading, if for no other reason than to see the different styles and techniques of today's best horror writers.	2005-10-10

No, it's not the same thing, but it was obviously inspired by King's book.  This is the first book I've read by Brian Freeman and although I enjoy his storytelling, his writing feels a bit pedestrian and the flow was uneven at times.  He would spend time on details and then, without warning, brush swiftly over more important actions.  I understand he is a young writer and I'm sure he will improve with experience.  That being said, since he's not a veteran writer with a large body of work, I find it strange that he has written under the pseudonym of James Kidman as well as his real name, Brian Freeman.  I'm not sure there's enough in this book to recommend it, but Freeman is certainly someone to keep your eye on.	2005-09-30
US	52954483	R2UGNI21YCP5SJ	0843952180	453244711	Darkfall	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Falls Flat	I read this book after hearing that a movie studio bought the film rights to produce it, saying it was a mix between The Thing and Die Hard.  Well, in theory, that's sounds like fun, but Stephen Laws did not pull it off.  The mythology Laws tries to create is initially interesting, but eventually just becomes too silly.<br /><br />What started out very promising, fell flat halfway through the novel.  I quickly became bored with the 150+ page chase scene up and down the stairwell and elevator.  Horror is about atmosphere and suspense.  This was more science fiction with a comic book villain awkwardly thrown in for danger.  Disappointing.	2005-09-29

I read all his work, so I think I'm a good and fair judge.  As always, his writing is technically very well done and it flows nicely, but the story this time was lacking in many departments.  Much of the dialogue felt melodramatic and at times -- gulp! -- it seemed like a tv-movie-of-the-week.  The dialogue for Janice's character seemed way over the top, as did the Senatorial candidate Jim Foley.<br /><br />I've read way too many stories about the cliched plot where a childhood secret comes back to haunt the protagonist.  I didn't feel the killer in this was very credible, intelligent, or scary at all.  He was just a crazy painter with a strange obsession that's never explained.  In conclusion, I just didn't feel that Kevin was very inspired in writing this book.  It felt like a paycheck.  I want the dark, edgy author that gave us \\"Make Them Cry\\" back.  That book dripped with evil and was a much better read.<br /><br />SPOILER:  When Siegel steps in a puddle of paint thinner, I highly doubt that his entire body would be engulfed in wild flames because his sock was wet.	2005-09-21

This is, without question, one of the best debut horror novels I've ever read.  This original tale grips you and never lets go, having one of my favorite all-time endings.  The world Elizabeth Massie creates is frighteningly real, populated with characters so believable that it sometimes feels like nonfiction.  I can't wait to dig into more of her books.

Don't you read the back of the book?  You know you're getting into some gruesome stuff, so why complain after you read it?  Anyway, this novel is very hardcore, and I'm so glad I've discovered J.F. Gonzalez.  He blends realistic human drama the way Richard Laymon writes and combines that with the raw sensibilities of Edward Lee.  The first half of the book is very inspired and is slightly better than the second half, but J.F.  comes on strong at the end for a very satisfying finish.  I can't wait to read more of his work.	2005-08-25

The premise is fantastic, but the execution is weak.  Lebbon's new style of writing tries to mimic Tom Piccirilli and T. M. Wright, but doesn't come anywhere close.  What took Lebbon over 300 pages to write should have been a 100 page novella.  Yes, there are a few great and original moments, but I think this book should have been in the fantasy section, not horror.  It was as scary as an episode of Seinfeld.	2005-08-13

It has all the usual things one would want in this type of genre - incredibly fast paced action, gore galore, lots of death, and some twists to the zombie mythology.  Herein lies my one problem with the book.  I would be more satisfied to have more mystery about the zombies/demons instead of being told ever single detail about the \\"rules\\" of why the undead are taking over.  The talking zombies with attitude also became slightly annoying.  Unlike The Rising, Keene wraps things up very nicely at the end, so I don't think we'll be seeing another sequel.  Oh, well, it was fun while it lasted.	2005-07-30

The great Richard Laymon won the Bram Stoker Award for best novel of the year for this book.  Although it's not his best (IN THE DARK and ISLAND are better), this is classic Laymon in suspense, perversion, and violence.  It has a very slow build and takes almost 300 pages to final get at the real action, but the ride is well worth it.  The last 90 pages is like a blast of adrenaline and makes up for a weak first three-quarters.  He builds the characters and suspense very slowly - sometimes too slowly -- but I still recommend the book.  The bottom line is this... Richard Laymon is a great storyteller and gives the horror fan an original taste of fear every time.	2005-07-15

I've always enjoyed his work, but this tops everything by miles.  The horror in this novel is not from any monster or creature, but from a lack of humanity and utter cruelty that lies dormant in some very disturbed people.  The terror is knowing what people are capable of doing, even from someone as close as a neighbor or family member.  This book is extremely shocking, but not for shock value.  It deals in the realistic abuse of children and doesn't sugar-coat anything.  What made this book even more poignant was the afterword by the author.  He states the idea for the story was based on a real life incident, and unfortunately, I'm sure it wasn't the only one.  As hard as you might try, you will never forget this novel.  My only regret is not having read it sooner.	2005-06-06

Mix a little of \\"Legion: Exorcist 3\\", \\"Angel Heart\\", and \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and you have \\"The Demonologist\\".  A very interesting first 100 pages creates an atmosphere of solid paranoia and suspense.  Pieces of the puzzle begin to fall nicely into place until the priest explains for over 20 pages everything that is going on, leaving most of the mystery solved by the middle of the book.  At that point, information is given to our protagonist (and the audience) a little too easily.  The ending, as well, seemed rushed and tacked on too nonchalantly.  However, the idea of God fighting along side of Satan to fight an even greater evil was fascinating and should stir up a little controversy.  Overall, this book was well written and had a few chilling moments, but I would still recommend \\"Deep In The Darkness\\" to highlight the author's impressive talents.<br /><br />SPOILER:  When the characters reach the motel, it is four o'clock in the morning.  The desk clerk apparently recognized them from the news reports earilier that night and informed the police.  However, the characters slept until nine thirty before they were apprehended at the motel by the authorities -- meaning that the police took 5 and 1/2 hours to get there!	2005-05-29

Like a fine wine, this series is definitely getting better.  Narcissus in Chains is by far my favorite book by Hamilton.  A lot of people don't seem to understand the importance of building characters.  This book didn't have the cheesy solve-the-mystery-and-hunt-down-the-bad-guy syndrome that quite a few Anita Blake stories have had.  This book delves into psyche of Anita and reveals to us what makes her tick, finally accepting who she is, and ultimately, the sacrifices she has to make.  The author has finally hit her stride and earned the R rated label that this series has been quoted to be.  This is an adult book and if people don't like it, they can switch to reading Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  I hope the unwarranted negative response to this book doesn't force Laurell Hamilton to dilute her future novels.  Critics must understand that if a character doesn't change throughout a series, they will never evolve and grow - for good or bad - but that is something that Anita Blake is starting to do and I couldn't be happier.	2005-05-17

This is a very well written book.  When his storytelling catches up with his writing skills, this author will be quite dangerous.

He started off very promising, but fell a notch with Fireworks and now fell even further with Possessions.  Like Fireworks, his books start off promising but two thirds of the way in take a nose dive.  Almost the last hundred pages of Possessions is nothing but a continuous fight scene involving monster after monster, with excessive descriptions on the creepy creatures.  Yes, Mr. Moore, I understand they are very yucky things.  I don't need a hundred pages describing them!  I get it.  With that said, Moore is quite talented at character development, but unfortunately those characters are left in a world that I've seen many times before.  This was too close to the Body Snatcher films for me.  The pace and tone of this book changed drastically in the last hundred pages and really pulled me out of the story.  I enjoyed Under The Overtree, so I'll give James A. Moore another chance.  But three strikes and you're out.	2005-04-16

I find that Clegg's strengths lie in his research and hospital atmosphere.  As soon as he writes about police procedure, I feel like it's one cliche after another.  My only other complaint is his random descriptions of scenery with detailed background on hills, mountains, and weather patterns.  Stick with the story, Doug.  That being said, I was very excited to put the pieces of the puzzle together as the story progressed.  It had some nice grim detail as well.  With this improvement over his last book, I'm definitely making another trip back to Darden State.  If you're looking for stunning serial killer books, check out Kevin O'Brien's work... especially \\"Make Them Cry\\" and \\"Left For Dead\\".	2005-04-08

It is apparent a lot of research went into the mythology of this book.  Whether people enjoy it or not, there is no denying Edward Lee's place in modern horror fiction.  He writes what every other writer is scared to put on paper.  They stop at an R rating, while he moves past -- way past NC-17.  But that's where the praise ends for me.  I found the ending rushed and many of the characters were only introduced in order to kill them off.  I enjoyed this book, but would recommend City Infernal much more.	2005-03-26

The story is a bit ridiculous and way over-the-top.  Yes, it has all the classic Laymon elements... unrelenting suspense, heaps of gore, extreme violence, graphic nudity, etc.  But this time his work felt forced.  At times it needed some editing and the ending was predictable and slightly anti-climactic.  It was still a fun read, but not a Laymon classic.  For new readers, start with \\"In the Dark\\" or \\"Island\\" to get a better feel for his mastery.	2005-03-06

Then, 200 pages of characters running and hiding in town after town became tedious.  The prose quickly became pedestrian and many times confusing, especially in the Keep's lower level battle with the enemy.  I never got a real sense of atmosphere or terror, as the book's cover touts.  Where was the passion in the writing?  It felt like the author was just going through the motions to meet his annual book quota.  I saw an ad for this novel in a writer's magazine and liked the premise and cover art and decided to give this author a try.  Oh, well.  You can't win them all.

The scenes in the beginning in the hospital are quite chilling and original.  However, the ending was very predictable and felt quite rushed.  With obvious inspiration from The Silence of the Lambs, there really isn't anything new here.  It's a fun, quick read, but if you want a truly chilling and intelligent read, check out thriller writer Kevin O'Brien.

From the very first chapter, the story starts off dreamlike, with an unsettling feeling in both the character and reader's mind.  Clark carefully and slowly builds the mystery between the characters, raising the stakes as the terror begins to mount.  This Clark's most mature book to date - and possibly his best, focusing on what we don't know instead of shoving mindless, predictable graphic violence at the reader (although I do love a good gory scene, now and again).  This has a solid beginning, middle, and end - with all the stuffings that a good horror novel should contain - believable characters in an original story that threatens their lives.  In addition, Clark's mythology of the lurking dangers are fascinating and hint to flavors in his other novel, Darker (another fine read).  Stranger and Darkness Demands are also recommended by Clark.	2004-12-15

Yes, the first half has all the makings of another Little classic, but it falls apart at the end when all the mysteries are explained in the last 30 pages.  If Bentley had peppered the novel with clues to what was happening from the beginning, I would have been more forgiving, but everything was so conveniently tied up that I could tell he was fighting to come up with a good ending.  He did the best he could, and I'm sure we'll see more great things from this underrated horror author in the future.

It takes 340 pages before any action happens.  The rest of the book is 2% action and 98% soap opera.  It's very predictable and feels like the series is running out of fuel.  At 585 pages, this novel should have a lot more story.  Hamilton stretches out each scene in painstaking detail.  Unfortunately, this is not one of her better books.  Yes, we learn more about the interesting Edward character, but Anita is so boring (even her choice of clothes is horrendous), you just don't care anymore.

This book is a little slow in the middle, but the beginning is like riding a rocket.  I was reading at lightning speed and had the biggest grin on my face.  Laymon's books are just so much fun!  Extremely gory, sexually graphic, and refreshingly unpredictable, BODY RIDES is among the best of his books (IN THE DARK, ISLAND, NO SANCTUARY are just a few).  If I was ever stranded on an island and allowed to read only one author, Richard Laymon would be the one.	2004-10-05

It has a fascinating premise -- the only surviving victim of a serial killer has amnesia.  This poses an amazing scenerio.  Her life is in grave danger because she is the only person that can identify the killer, but she only remembers things in bits and pieces, and doesn't know who to trust.  In theory, this should be a 5-star book, but I seemed to figure out the ending less than halfway through.  Many of the clues and paranoid character traits tipped me off.  I also found a dozen or more spelling and grammatical error that annoyed me.  Nevertheless, it was a wild, suspenseful ride and I definitely recommend this book.

This book is labeled a horror novel by the publisher, and although the first half is very promising, it turns into nothing more than a military controlled warzone.  Where's the horror?  Where's the aliens?  Where's the protagonist?  The book shifts from one character to another without reason and fizzles out at the end.  The first half was 4 stars, the second half was 2... so Fireworks deserves a 3.  My other gripe is all the spelling errors in the last third of the book.  Did the copy editor just give up two-thirds of the way through?  It was very annoying and pulls you right out of the story.  That being said, James A.

I'll hesitantly pick up Scott's new book, The Manor, where hopefully he will impress me as he did with his first book, The Red Church.	2004-08-03

Wright book out on the stands... and this one is no exception.  There are a few spelling errors that sometimes pop up throughout the book, but that can't be blamed on the author... fire the copy editor!!!!  This novel resonated with me long after I was finished.  The mythology was facinating, the characters real, and the pacing of the scenes and dialogue moved wonderfully.  I was slightly unsatisfied with the ending, but I still rank T.M. Wright among the top 10 horror authors of the last 2 decades.	2004-06-08

This is my first experience with James Moore and after reading, &quot;Under the Overtree&quot;, it won't be my last.  Although the book is a little long, Moore somehow keeps things quite engaging with his detail of characters and his skill of quickly moving scenes.  I found a lot of spelling errors throughout this book -- which unfortunately seems fairly common in Leisure's titles these days.  Moore's writing is mostly smooth, but I found a few times where his sentence structure confused me and I had to re-read sections numerous times to figure out what was going on.  Another issue I had with the book was the scare factor... there really wasn't any.  James A. Moore is a solid writer, but his scenes of horror are still a little conservative.  With all that aside, I had a lot of fun with this book and look forward to reading his newer novel &quot;Fireworks&quot; and &quot;Possessions&quot;.	2004-05-30

Needless to say, it's not your typical horror novel.  This is my first time reading Gary Braunbeck's work, and it won't be the last.  Every page of this novel is so utterly original that other authors should be embarrassed.  Mr. Braunbeck has definitely raised the bar in the field of dark fiction... notice I didn't say horror fiction.  The scare factor wasn't quite there, but I still loved the ride he took me on.  Mr. Braunbeck obviously put a lot of effort into this book and it was well worth it.  I am a fan for life.  Thank you Don D'Auria (Leisure's horror editor) for bringing Gary A. Braunbeck on board.  I see a Bram Stoker Award in the near future for this man.	2004-05-05

A little predictable at times, however, I couldn't seem to put it down.  It's more of a drama with some aspects of a thriller that is well written and contains some powerful images.  It's such a simple story that I think might make a better movie than a book -- one of the rare times.  I look forward to seeing more of Ketchum's work from the Leisure horror line... let's just hope that &quot;horror&quot; is what it is.  The other novella in the novel is called The Passenger and it's not nearly as good (2 and 1/2 stars).  The Passenger goes off on many strange tangents that never seem believable and contains too many coincidences.  That said, it's still worth buying for the story of Red.	2004-04-22

Edward Lee holds back a little on his regular helping of extreme gore, but peppers the story with enough digusting elements to satisfy his fan base and attract new fans.  The clues of the main storyline come together very nicely at the end.  It's a fascinating plot that has a big payoff and if you enjoyed City Infernal, you'll eat this book up quick.  I heard a rumor that Lee has outlined a third book in the series.  If that's true, and you would like to read it, simply write an email to Don D'Auria (the editor of Leisure's horror line) at Dorchester Publishing and let him know to greenlight the book.	2004-04-09

It's not scary or very horrific at all (with the exception of two or three scenes).  The book is solidly written, but the story moves along like a TV movie-of-the-week, from one clue to another -- none of which is very believable.  The coincidences and connections seem to easy and unrealistic, as if Mr. Connolly is struggling to connect the pieces of the story together.  The story does moves rather quickly, but seems to be bogged down by various sub-plots that take our chararacter off in different directions.  It's funny that one of Charlie Parker's first leads was the witness Marcy Becker, but conveniently Charlie doesn't get around to looking for her until the end.  The book would have been 100 pages long if he had.  I also had a problem with the amount of cliches during many of the action /danger scenes.  With the exception of the very enjoyable opening involving Alison Beck, I've seen everything in this book before.  A much better thriller writer is author Kevin O'Brien.  With books like &quot;Make Them Cry&quot; and &quot;Watch Them Die&quot;, he leaves John Connolly in the dust.	2004-03-27

Too many flashbacks interrupted the pace and tension of the story.  Many of the characters engage in actions that go against their characteristics and seem quite unbelievable.  This is not a book to start if you want a good introduction to Laymon.  It's mildly enjoyable, but give his other work a try because he's still one of the top 10 horror writers of the last two decades.	2004-03-14

Everyone can write a stinker once in their career.  So I picked up \\"Deep In the Darkness\\" and I couldn't stop reading it.  Believe me, no one was more surprised than me at how great this book is.  It has everything great horror should have... characters you care about placed in insurmountable danger, creepy atmosphere that continues to build and raise the stakes, and a solid story that keeps you hooked.  This story reminded me of a lot of Rick Hautala's books from the eighties (especially \\"Little Brothers\\"), but I enjoyed the twists and turns and very tight plotting. Everything is done for a reason in Laimo's new book and the pieces of his puzzle connect very naturally from beginnning to end.  This has Bram Stoker potential written all over it and I wish Mr. Laimo luck with his success.  I feel strange giving this book 5 stars, but I really couldn't find anything wrong with it.  I finished it in 3 days and had a blast.  Keep up the great work and I hope to see you at Horrorfind this year!	2004-03-03

Not only am I in the film industry, but I'm a huge fan of horror.  So I thought this book would be perfect for me.  Unfortunately, with little to no character development or atmosphere, this book is dead on arrival.  I have to say, Scream Queen is the most predictable horror novel I've ever read.  Every single scene I've seen done before.  The author also makes quite a few mistakes when describing positions on a film crew.  It's no wonder Mr. Van Belkom got his technical information about filmmaking from Ron Oliver -- the director of Prom Night III !  I also found it funny to learn that this author has written books on how to write horror and erotica when this book contains neither!  Scream Queen is a total flop and a complete waste of time.

But seriously, the tension constantly builds throughout this book.  Near the end, I was actually nervous and a little queasy inside.  It has great characterization and a terrific ending.  I've read very few books where the author really delves into the mind of what some men are thinking about how life and women treat them.  The writing in this book is quite simple, but the message and issues could not be more deep.  It has subject matter that has no easy answers or solutions.  Very graphic and very entertaining.  I read this in 2 days.  I hope Leisure Books puts out more of Mr. Gerlach's work, because I'll buy them in a second.	2004-02-18

The Rising is an exhilarating ride from beginning to end.  Gory fun, detailed zombies, and danger on almost every page, this was a real treat to read.  However, besides a few spelling errors, I did have a few problems.  I would have liked a little more character development and a little more atmosphere.  A few cliched scenes aside (the gang's dialogue at the zoo and the blanket attitude of all the military), this was a fast read and I was entertained for most of it.  The ending was a little bit of a letdown, but hopefully there will be a sequel sometime in the future.  If zombies are your thing, this book is jam-packed with the undead.  Enjoy.	2004-02-13

That his world spirals into madness and confusion, and we, as readers, are expected to take the ride with him.  Okay, that's fine.  I understand.  But confusion does not satisfy my need for a solid, scary story.  I'm someone who needs a payoff.  Yes, the book is well written and starts off very powerful, but I had to work hard to get through the last 100 pages.  I usually love this writer, and although I was still entertained by &quot;Laughing Man&quot;, I would recommend some of T.M.'s other work for new readers.  &quot;The Last Vampire&quot; and &quot;Sleepeasy&quot; are both much better.	2004-02-07

It's probably 1 and a half, but I can't give it that.  Okay, where do I begin?  The back of the book makes it seem like an epic battle between birds and bees and the entire existence of mankind.  Well, in this 340 page book, the first scene of violence only starts on page 175 and the real danger starts on page 250.  So what happened for most of the book?  A bunch of tedious character studies and random sexual encounters that make this book seem like a romance novel with a few dangerous moments thrown in for good measure.  No atmosphere.  No scares.  Spelling and grammar errors aside, the writing was simple and flowed rather nicely, but Ms. Giron simply forgot to add in a plot.  Characters doing nothing for 75% of the book isn't a story!  Leisure Books usually has the cream of the crop in the horror literary world (Simon Clark, Tom Piccirilli, Richard Laymon, T.M. Wright, Jack Ketchum, etc.), so how in the world did Don D'Auria choose Ms. Giron to become a member?  If you want a good laugh, pick up the book at the store and read pages 239 and 240.

This has got to be -- without question -- one of the sickest, most repulsive books ever written.  That's both a good and a bad thing.  The good thing is that it's a novella, so it's a fairly quick read.  It's a solid story with some surprising depth behind it.  The bad part is that a lot of the story seems to be a showcase of how gross the authors can get.  It almost feels like a competition between the two authors to see who can come up with a more disgusting scene.  At times, things are so ridiculous, I just had to laugh at this nonstop freakshow.  This book is not for everyone, but if you can stomach some truly hardcore horror, give this a try.  It's certainly an eye-opener.	2004-01-15

I agree with the first reviewer that this is better than &quot;Blood Crazy&quot;.  It had more believable characters, more realistic situations, and a convincing ending that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Not everything is spelled out for the reader -- which is where your imagination takes over.  My only two problems were (don't worry -- no spoilers) the two things I didn't buy... (1) the towns punishment and (2)Mel's discovery.  Everything else was quite nice.  However, this wasn't a scary book, but if you enjoy apocalyptic epics, this is a fun ride.

Wright to prove you wrong.  This a wonderfully dark story with fascinating characters you care about.  T.M.'s emphasis is on atmosphere and less on graphic violence and gore (although he has that, too).  This author writes for an intelligent audience by not spelling out everything for the reader.  You have to read between the lines in many scenes.  I became swept up in this novel and finished it in 2 days.  If you are tired of the same old vampire story, give this breath of fresh air a try.  You won't be disappointed.	2004-01-03

I found this to be the weakest of his books.  Too much wandering and too many coincidences to be believable for my taste.  Nonetheless, it is well written.  For new Clark fans, I would recommend trying &quot;Darkness Demands&quot; first - a darker and more mature novel.	2004-01-03

This is an original, refreshing, and creepy novel by one of horror's veterans.  There is no question T. M. is a great writer, but beyond that - and more importantly - he's a great storyteller.  I breathed a sigh of relief after reading this book because I felt lucky that I stumbled upon his work.  Many good authors get swept under the radar for whatever reason... bad marketing by publishers, readers not willing to take a chance on a new author, bad cover art, etc.  But the good news is that I've found him, and that's all that really matters.

The prologue kicks off very nicely, but it goes way down hill from there.  With every book, it seems Hamilton gives Anita more and more power for only one reason -- to continue this contrived story and prolong the series.

Well, the beginning is quite gripping and I loved the concept of a family picking up a strange hitchhiker in the middle of a snow storm.  It seems that the author started writing with this idea and didn't know where to go with it.  Spelling errors aside, Lebbon repeats many of the character's thoughts over and over.  Yes, we get the point, you don't need to tell us again!  Anyway, having no growth with the characters and a disappointing ending, I cannot recommend this book.  Tim Lebbon also seems like he's holding back with scenes, taking the easy way out with his conservative scares and sexual themes.  Richard Laymon, Bentley Little, and Tom Piccirilli do it much better.	2003-09-11

I realize the author was hospitalized around the time he wrote this, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I was disappointed nonetheless.

I'm always looking out for new authors to breath fresh air into the genre.  Tom Piccirilli, Richard Laymon, Bentley Little, and Simon Clark are just a few of the modern horror authors that almost never let you down.  So I gave Michael Laimo a chance, especially after his Bram Stoker nomination, and read Atmosphere.<br />First of all, I have to mention all the errors I found in the book (without giving anything away, of course).  On page 25, the bald man is described as wearing boots.  However,in his next scene, he is wearing sneakers on page 51.  Also, in chapter 7, Jaimie is waiting 30 minutes for a F train in Manhattan at 5:12 pm for over a half hour during rush hour.  WHAT?!  I've lived in New York for over ten years and never waited even half that long during rush hour.  But whatever.  On page 256 -- and this really irked me -- Laimo writes about a wrestler from the WWF that was supposed to win in the eighth round.  Eighth round???  This isn't boxing.  There are no rounds in professional wrestling!  Not only that, he writes about wrestling moves that don't even exist, calling one spot a &quot;triple twist flip&quot;.  A writer should always do his homework.  After all, as the saying goes, write what you know.<br />In conclusion, I found many scenes repetitive and characters discovering information way too easily.  One coincidence after another occured, giving Laimo an easy way out of everything.  Please... bribing a coroner, committing suicide from a second story window, and stuffing an 18 inch sphere into ones jacket pocket are just some of the ridiculousness we are meant to accept.  And as for the other reviewers comments regarding the huge amounts of gore?  I'm not sure what book people were reading... this had 4 or 5 scenes of gore, and only a paragraph or two at most.  If you thought this was strong stuff, try reading Edward Lee's &quot;The Chosen&quot; or &quot;City Infernal&quot; or Richard Laymon's &quot;In the Dark&quot;.  And besides all that, in short, Atmosphere was very predictable and simply... not very atmospheric.l&quot; or Richard Laymon's &quot;In the Dark&quot;.

It took a while to get into the story, but it was interesting enough for me to finish it.  The big problems were the lack of character development and the overwritten style of his descriptions.  He takes a full page to describe what should be only be a paragraph.  By doing this, I constantly got pulled out of the story.  What brought me back?  The villian.  I love a powerful antagonist that seems on track to conquer our hero, and this novel made up a few points in that area.

There are painters that you can instantly notice even if you were to only see a portion of the picture.  The same with brilliant filmmakers.  You see thirty seconds of a Martin Scorsese film and you know it's his.  Well, the same goes for Tom Piccirilli.  I had permanent smile on my face for the entire book, completely engrossed and fascinated with his authentic world of the occult.  A was confused a few time with what was going on, but even still, it is near perfect.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you want something different.	2003-06-27

This book is better than Blood Crazy, but not as well thought out as Darker.  That being said, it was an enjoyable read with some good atmosphere and a pace that keeps up its rhythm until the powerful end.  Simon could work on developing his characters a little more, but I was completely satisfied with the experience.  This author promises to be one to look out for in the world of horor.

Moondeath, Moonbog, Night Stone, Winter Wake, Dead Voices, etc.  Even when he wrote under the name A.J. Matthews.  On the whole, I have enjoyed all his work (except Mountain King).  However, being a good novelist doesn't always mean you are effective at writing short stories.  In this case, I think Rick is a better novelist. I knew the ending to most of the short stories way before their conclusion.  Yes, they are well written, but I've read similar stories like them before.  The only real gem in the collection is &quot;...from a Stone&quot;.  Other good ones are, &quot;The Back of My Hands&quot;, &quot;Colt .24&quot;, and &quot;Rubies and Pearls&quot;.

Is Laurell running out of ideas?  Nothing really happens in the first 125 pages.  I can only read so much pretentious bragging and threats made by the vampire council before I'm just not scared by them anymore... an neither, apparently, is Anita.  Some sloppy editing and writing make this the worst in the series.  For instance, Chapter 16 uses the word \\"cool\\" FIVE times in the first paragraph.  Maybe Laurell should concentrate more on quality and focus less on cranking out her yearly deadline.	2003-05-22

However, once the action gets started, the villians are just your basic cardboard cutouts.  Yeah, you still get the creatures and thrill of entering the enemy lair, but the story definitely did not hold up the entire way.  The last third was your basic chase-the-bad-guy-and-save-the-girl routine.  I also had a problem with the protagonist always getting caught, seemingly at random, by the bad guys.  But don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this quick read, and if you're into Lovecraft, you will want to give yourself a treat and buy this book.

Finally	Yes, I've been reading this series in order, starting with Guilty Pleasures, and I have to agree with most of the reviewers that say that this is the best book (so far) in the series.  Anita is finally making decisions and focusing in on her personal life.  There are still some confusing rules about magic and being in a triumvirate.  This plot device allows Hamilton to conveniently craft her story, but it seems like an easy way out to solve the problems and obstacles in Anita's life.  Hamilton is focusing too much on Anita and her problems and not enough on the world she lives in.  On a positive note, Hamilton's overly descriptive clothing is toned down (thank God!), and the pace is extremely fast moving... not to mention the steamy scenes that the fans have finally been waiting for.  I look forward to book # 7, Burnt Offerings.	2003-03-16

Finally, Laurell Hamilton brings together all the elements she has tried to write about in the last four books;  An original story with horror, mystery, passion, sharp dialogue, great settings, clear action, and believable characters that are consistent with their decisions.  Some other improvements include fewer spelling errors... although I found a mistake regarding one of Hamilton's descriptions where she wrote, &quot;stop action&quot; instead of &quot;stop motion&quot;.  Where's the editor?  No big deal, but this shouldn't happen with a New York Times Bestseller.  BLOODY BONES, while not perfect, has raised the bar a little higher for Anita Blake.

Anita's character was inconsistent with her attitude between Richard and Jean-Claude.  Anita would NEVER allow Jean-Claude to interfere with her personal life and give in to his ridiculous proposal to date her against her will when she's so in love with Richard.  As for the thrown-together mystery involving the murders of lycanthropes, I couldn't believe the author expected her readers to believe that within the same week, three seperate killers without knowing each other were killing them off.  Sorry, this is just not credible.  Not to mention the obvious tip-off when the &quot;bad guys&quot; show up.  I'm starting to really be annoyed by Anita's attitude.  She can't stop complaining about her life, no matter how good she has it.  She is becoming unlikable as a character... and that's not a good sign.	2003-01-12

With the exception of the spelling and grammatical errors and the way-too-quick ending, this was a very enjoyable read.  A million-year-old vampire???  Please!  But the rest of the book was good enough for me to overlook those problems.  Finally, Anita is developing real relationships with other characters, both with friends and possible lovers.  The action is fast and the body count is high.  Hamilton's world is shaping up nicely and I'm looking forward to book # 4, THE LUNATIC CAFE, which I hear is one of the best.	2003-01-08

This second book is at least as good as the first, but I found it immediately falling into a holding pattern.  I wanted to learn more about this world where humans and vampires co-exist.  But instead, Hamilton briefly skims by the legal and social issues which make the concept so interesting.  I wanted to see some sort of advancement between the characters of Anita and Jean Claude, but it feels the same as it did in the first novel.  I enjoyed the action scenes and much of the horror, but I felt the crime scene with Anita throwing body parts across the room was uncharacteristic and silly.  My only other problem (and part of the blame falls on the editor for this) is that many times Hamilton assumes certain actions for the characters without writing them.  For instance, she describes characters entering a room, and, moments later, they are standing up from a chair to leave.  When did they sit down?  She skips certain actions that take me out of the story.  Not a big deal, but it's very distracting.  Anyway, like GUILTY PLEASURES, THE LAUGHING CORPSE is good enough for me to return for the third book.	2003-01-02

I was not disappointed.  The fast paced chapters and the originl ideas kept me turning pages.  It was a quick three day read.  However, the cover of the book claimed, \\"A heady mix of romance and horror\\".  I saw the horror, but where's the romance?  The only hint of romance happened on page 148... and the book is only 266 pages long!  I expected some really steamy scenes, but I got none of that.  My only other complaint is the random rules Laurell Hamilton seems to make up regarding the raising of zombies and ghouls to fit her storyline.  But don't get me wrong, the danger and villains are plentiful.  Instead of the standard ways in which to kill a vampire, characters use syringes to inject silver nitrate into the undead's bloodstream.  This is something I really like. Putting a spin on the classic vampire mythology by incorporating today's technology.  I'm looking forward to the second book in the series, \\"The Laughing Corpse\\".	2002-12-22

Believe me, I've slapped myself after the first few chapters as punishment for not reading him sooner. This book reads like lightning... which is great, but it's also it's weakness. Things happen too quickly near the end and some of the dialogue is a little stiff. But have no fear, the positive far outweighs the negative.

This is my first time reading this author and although I was slightly disappointed, I will give his work another chance.  I have no idea why this book takes place in the 60's.  Except for the rare mention of the Vietnam war and the Sharon Tate murders, it could have easily taken place in modern times.  I never got the sense of nostalgia or flavor for that era.  Also, I felt some of the chapters were uneven, some quickly racing through the plot while others dragged on endlessly without any payoff (ie... the New York City dinner with Katherine).  The novel is peppered with some akward sentence structure and very few, if any, likable characters.  However, it has it's moments of tension and suspense.

I was very excited to read the new King book, especially since this was supposed to be his big comeback to horror.  However, with the exception of ONE scene in the book, NOTHING at all was terrifying.  Not scary, not even a little creepy.  King had 879 pages to work with and did nothing with them.  Sure, the writing itself is good -- no one denies that.  But he needed to get to the point a lot sooner.  Master horror authors such as Bentley Little and Richard Laymon could have wrote this book much more effectively in less than half the space!  He rambles on and on and on.  Maybe the reason this book is so mediocre is that King's real-life car accident did permanent damage to his brain.	2002-03-12

So I was very excited to get my hands on &quot;The Next To Die&quot;.  However, even though I enjoyed reading it, I found it too preachy and one sided, with the villains very shallow and predictable.  Yes, the relationships were believable and most of the characters were well developed, but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers who commented about the research that went into this book.  I found a few things that were not correct.  For instance, on page 387, a director of a movie calls &quot;Roll cameras&quot; when the clapboard has already been closed.  As a filmmaker, it is common knowledge that the slate is closed only AFTER the cameras roll, in order to sync the sound to the picture.  This might sound picky, but I found a lot of mistakes throughout the book like this.  Maybe this is why the book was released only on paperback instead of hardcover, like &quot;Only Son&quot;. Whatever the case, you can be sure I'll still be looking for O'Brien's new novel later next year.  You can't make a perfect novel every time.	2001-07-31

If you don't agree with the author's political stance (an eye for an eye, let me live in complete freedom - the less government, the better), you might get annoyed with it.  I rather enjoyed imagining a world where you truly get what you deserve.  The book is chock-full of spys, action, twists, sex, humor, and moves very quickly.  The simplicity of the writing didn't bother me, allowing me to finish it in 3 days.  It also helps move it along.<br /> As for the reviewer from Chicago, I'm surprised (and confused) that even though you didn't like the book, you read &quot;seven other books&quot; in the series.  I would think that (giving it a rating of 1) would have you staying far away from them... but 7 others !?  I guess you are hooked - whether you like it or not - like the thousands of other &quot;Ashes&quot; fans around the world!  As for your comments on people not joining the militia if they had problems with the government... it's already (and has been for a while) happening in the south, with certain groups having hundreds of members.  Knowing about some of the battles in history,  it is not unrealistic for a few thousand people to die on one side and only lose a few hundred on the other... great leaders win great battles.<br /><br />If you are tired of government and big business controlling 90% of everything in society, and would like to see what could happen without them, give this series a try.  It's only in theory, of course, but it's a damn good one.	1997-12-15

It's very fast-paced - maybe too much so - and ends with you wanting more.  I would have liked a little more characterization with regards to the lead charater, Terry Kovak, who seems to spend too much time with his ladies and not enough doing what he was trained to do... kill.  However, I have a feeling that with the sucess of this re-release, he will save more of the killing for a sequel down the road	1997-09-17
