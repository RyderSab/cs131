And he makes a very good argument for how putting liberalism first has tended to work better than putting democracy first. <br /> <br />And while he finds India an exception to this, I think India to a certain degree followed this model as England did bring them a liberal system before they became a democracy. <br /> <br />With all that said however, he makes no allowances for the fact that the world has changed. Nationalism has become more and more critical in the post WWII era. And at the same time democracy has taken on an almost mythical mantra as the prime goal to shoot for. <br /> <br />In the world we have now, democracy, in some form, must come with liberalism or even preceed it. In places like the Ukraine and Lebanon democracy has a very good chance of leading to liberalism. <br /> <br />And in Iraq, elections were the only way to give the government a cloak of legitimacy. Without the elections we would not have a prayer. <br /> <br />So as a history lesson, good book. <br /> <br />As a look forward to what will work in the future, of some interest. <br />	2005-05-04

On the plus side, it is a very clear concise guide to unit testing - a great introduction.<br /><br />On the negative side, I figured that any decent programmer already knows what's covered here. Even those who don't write unit tests (bad programmer, bad) knows what they are and how to do it.<br /><br />Then I was stuck on how to unit test in a particular case and the author email me - look on page 37. And there it was.<br /><br />So, if you are learning to program - GET THIS BOOK. No one will hire you unless you know this. If you're an experienced programmer, it can still teach you a thing or two.<br /><br />- dave thielen<br /><br />ps - the author is a friend of mine and that did cause me to round up my 4.5 rating.	2005-04-30

The problem I have with this book is not the author's point of view as different points of view can lead to new ways of looking at the same information.<br /><br />But the author is so fixed on reaching his conclusions that he doesn't just bend the facts to reach his conclusions but makes wild jumps. It reminds me of the professor where on the blackboard at one point in his equation has \\"and a miracle occurs.\\"<br /><br />Case in point, he discusses arguments about how Roosevelt may have tried to force Japan to attack the U.S. to drag us in to WWII. He views everything from that viewpoint. And then, instead of saying that there is a strong argument that Roosevelt tried to get Japan to attack us, his conclusion is that Roosevelt unequivocably forced Japan to attack us.<br /><br />And then he made the same claim that Roosevelt forced Germany to also declare war on the U.S. And in the case of this conclusion, basically didn't even bring up any strong arguments.<br /><br />Viewpoints I disagree with that are intelligently reasoned I love to read as they make me think. But random conclusions reached solely on the author's biases are a waste of paper.	2005-03-15

But this is not to put the book down, I found it more interesting and valuable because of what it covered.    To give you an idea, he goes in to the difference between the world view of \\"Old Europe\\" and the U.S. This different world view is not the sole cause of issues between the two groups - but it did add to my understanding of the cultural difference that exists.    It is definitely not a blow by blow of the actual battles. But I think it's a more interesting and useful book than a blow by blow account would be.	2005-03-15

The author is a German who does not think Rommel was all that great. And so you have the whole series of events in Africa viewed from a critical German perspective.<br /><br />And as he says, Rommel was very lucky in who he had as opponents. The British were horribly led in the begining (with some notable exceptions) leading to numerous German victories.<br /><br />This is not a \\"must read.\\" But it is worth the time and the unique viewpoint of the author makes it quite informative.	2005-01-23

And it doesn't hurt that the author is an excellent writer. <br /> <br />The author was in charge of maintance & repair for the division's tanks. So he was as close to the battle as you could be without actually fighting in one of the tanks. I think that one step removed gave him an even better view of events than if he was in a tank. <br /> <br />And his observations of the Army, West Point, the command structure, and others involved in the battle is brutally honest. He doesn't pull any punches. <br /> <br />A book you cannot put down that takes you there and gives you an honest picture of an American armored division.	2005-01-23

Ten minutes later I ordered my own copy. This book is great. <br /> <br />What it is is for about 70 small programming problems, it shows you how to write it. Both the code and the explanation. So in many cases you can just copy the code.

Revolutionary battles are covered in 1 paragraph. But then it goes on in fascanating detail as to the political ramifications of the battle. <br /> <br />And it's not just the war. The book starts about 10 years before the declaration and goes up to Jefferson't inaguration. So you get the political sweep from when the colonists first started thinking of independence up to the point where the republic had a good chance of continuing to exist. <br /> <br />What is amazing how at so many points, the U.S. almost did not come in to being. And how at later points it slmost fell apart. And this book lays it all out in detail. <br /> <br />If you are interested in the real story of the creation of the United States, this is the book to read.	2005-01-23

But as I read I found myself starting to ask myself - what is it teaching me? And as I continued through the answer was - very little.    The South chose to not build railroads or factories - WHY? The battle to fund the transcontinental railroad was a major political fight for decades - no discussion of that fight. I could go on about point after point.    I'd say reading this is like watching the TV show Friends. It's an enjoyable experience but afterwards you haven't learned anything.	2005-01-23

The stated reason for the book is to discuss the personal relationship between FDR and Churchill - which is one of the most important friendships in history. But it actually doesn't dive in to the personal relationship that much.    And for discussing a friendship, large chunks of time are jumped over with not much of a mention - yet during these periods there was ongoing communication between FDR and Churchill.    I think I have learned more about the relationship between these two from reading other books about the war itself - and how command decisions were arrived at at the top.    Bottom line - you will learn little from this book.	2005-01-23

And it also gives a front row picture of the confusion as England tried to stop the Japanese early on. <br /> <br />The book is well written (not superb). It's the actual story that moves this up to 4 stars from 3. It's was written during the war and the style shows.

It is an incredible story. It is a battle that if not for the incredible heroism and luck of the U.S. Navy, the pacific war could have been set back significantly (who knows what effect a tactical victory at that point would have had on the Japanese decision to continue fighting or surrender). And it is very well told. <br /> <br />To me the most incredible part is how each U.S. commander on the spot made the right decision and in many cases, assuming that they and their ship would die, attacked the Japanese fleet. This is a story of the incredible professionalism and bravery of the U.S. Navy in WWII. And in the case of the ships involved, a Naval staff that was almost entirely civilians before Dec 7. <br /> <br />It also shows Halsey at his worst - and deservedly so.	2005-01-23

But it's 4 or 5 so I picked 4. <br /> <br />The battle of the bulge is really a story of countless places where American troops cut off, and having no idea what is going on, in many many cases stood and fought. It is a testament to the advantages of the American Army where troops do readily step up and take the initiative. <br /> <br />In this case it is a single platoon - and an understaffed recon platoon at that that held up one of the main northern attacks of the Germans. The book does an excellent job of explaining the platoon level action from both sides. <br /> <br />And it then tells the story of the troops captured and their time in the German POW camps. This part of the book is good, but not as inspired as the first part. <br /> <br />ps - my favorite book from the Battle of the Bulge is \\"Those Damned Engineers\\"	2005-01-23

It is a basic intro to rtf (and in all fairness it does say that in the begining of the book).<br />But even as in intro, it covers very little. For example, nothing about lists (ie bulleted or numbered paragraphs). So it's very very basic.<br />Second, it's wrong in places.

You can and it's well documented in the Microsoft spec.<br />In short, if you know nothing about rtf, this is an ok start. But that's about it.<br />- dave<br />The author has asked me to add the following - which I do agree with: \\"The biggest mistake I saw is that it missed a simple way to embed jpg's and png's in documents, and instead suggested complicated workarounds.\\"	2003-08-06

But this book is very dangerous.    If you took the CISSP exam and could refer to this book in the exam - but it was your only source - you would flunk the exam. It flat-out does not cover areas of knowledge that the exam asks questions on. (And also covers a number of areas that the exam never touches on.)    The danger is if the book was your main basis for the exam, you will walk in to the exam totally unprepared. (I can't give specifics because you sign a confientiality agreement when taking the exam.)    My suggestion for taking the CISSP exam; 1) Exam prep alone won't do it - you need to be an experienced security professional to take this test (that's what saved my a**). 2) Get a prep book that was written recently (I am assuming the problem with this book is that the areas being tested has changed).

And it has a ton of information in it, both big picture as well as a lot of detail.    The one thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it does not do a good job of placing what is described in the bigger picture of Japan at that time or of the allies. It's as though McArthur and the allied occupation is there, and at times has a (sometimes very strong) influence. But the rest of the time - nothing about them. And yet, they were the most significant single force for change in the culture.    The same for the overall political climate in Japan. The emperor appears occasionally as do the top politicians. And the mood of the citizens is covered at times. But a lot of the time what is happening is listed as though it occurs in a vaccuum.

I've read a lot about Churchill and yet I was lost at times trying to figure out where/what/when on some of the events.    There is a lot better out there (William Manchester's 2 volumes for example).	2002-04-01

First, I couldn't put it down. At over 500 pages that meant a couple of very late nights. But it is so well written that it holds on to you.<BR>And what it is about - the entire history of the oil industry. And it's all there, laid out clearly and in order and showing how it all ties together.<BR>This is basically a perfect example of how all history books should be written. And proof that you can write an exhaustive history and make it thouroughly enjoyable to read.	2002-04-01
US	50855911	R2DCQM1Q0F7HP2	0300078129	35904091	1: The Road to Stalingrad: Stalin`s War with Germany, Volume One	Books	3	15	19	N	N	Could have been so good	What is written is an excellent book. Full of information and detail. But there are no maps - not one. So the only way to follow the book is to have a map of Russia and at times you are going over the map once per paragraph.<BR>If it had included maps showing the location of the troop movements discussed, it would be a great book. Without any maps it's painful to useless.	2002-03-11

It takes you through the history of reconstruction, the political fighting, how it played out locally, and how it played out in the elections.    And at the end you realize, this country was on the cusp of moving forward on race. We had it. It wasn't perfect but progress was being made.    And it was all defeated because the republicans hoped to win elections in the south by supporting the old power structure. And so the blacks were sacrificed for votes - and the republicans didn't get the votes anyways.    Absolutely engrossing.	2002-03-10

Most of the fighting in the Pacific was the Navy and the Marines. And the Marines were the ones that stormed ashore against withering fire and then won, inch by inch and island by island.<BR>And it does an excellent job of putting you right there. In the innumerable firefights on Guadacanal and the vicious jungle of New Brittan and the combat hell of islands like Tarawa.<BR>And when you are done you realize what incredible soldiers these men were.	2002-03-10

He wants each culture to stay unpolluted by other cultures. Personally, I feel that if the world wants to eat Big Macs while watching Baywatch, it's a good thing that they can instead of being restricted to food and TV they like less.    2) He lists Chad as the most fair user of energy in the world - because they use the least per person. I view Chad as a place of short and miserable lives who's abject poverty makes energy use beyond the reach of all but a few. While prolifigite energy use is not good, I think the energy use necessary for a first world lifestyle for a countries citizens is a good thing. It means longer, happier, healthier lives.    3) He views consumerism as a terrible thing - selling people things they don't have to have. While it's true we all buy things that are necessary to a basic life - again I think it's a good thing that people can buy things who's basic purpose is enjoyment. I see no advantage to giving up TV, movies, computer games, etc.    To sum it up, I would bet this guy does not have a TV in his house (which is fine). But he also probably thinks others should not too - while most of the world would be thrilled to be able to afford and have a TV in their house.    And it's funny to read his predictions of the U.S. Economy going downhill (he wrote in 1995) when the last 7 years have shown him to be dead wrong on that.	2002-03-10

Not only that, but after each chapter I just stopped and thought for a minute or two. Just incredible.<BR>Get it and read it.	2002-03-10

And yet this command was the most innovative of any command of any power in WWII. They invented a totally new type of warfare and quickly learned to execute it exceptionally well.    And they also made do with so little, winning Midway and holding Guadacanal by the skin of their teeth. The ability to know exactly where to fight and how is an incredible story.    Does this book get that? Yes, some of it. But for a book that revolves around this, it gets suprisingly little. The U.S. submarine fleet sunk half the Japanese ships and basically isolated Japan from it's raw material sources. Yet it's not mentioned in this book.    Add to that no real mention of how the Navy learned to develop amphibious warfare and to combine that with strong carrier support. And what you are left with is another book that just goes through the main battles of the pacific war, with a bit more emphasis on the admirals in charge.	2002-03-10
