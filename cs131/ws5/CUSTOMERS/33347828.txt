This is the first book I have read by Gemmell and can honestly say I will be reading more. Gemmell has a straight forward style that is not over the top, but he has a knack for weaving a great believable story. I never post spoilers in my reviews, but there are two things in this book that I didn't see coming. One positive and one negative, I'll let you decide which is which.<br /><br />The characters are what truly drive this book. While the story is good, the characters are that much better. From Rek and Druss to Bowman and Hogun, they are all believable and all have their flaws that add to the story. Another thing that I found particularly enjoyable was the dialog of the characters. Gemmell has a way of making sure the reader hears different voices in their head as the characters talk. I have been told that character dialect is one of the most difficult things for a writer to do and Gemmell pulls it off with no problems at all. I have read books that are character driven that I have not liked at all, yet with these characters you don't want the book to end.<br /><br />On top of great characters is a pretty straightforward plot, but done in such a way that the reader doesn't know what to expect. I mentioned before the hero of old returns from retirement to fight in this epic battle. I am not one that enjoys reading about these large scale battles, I think they are over done and can be found in to many books, yet the way Gemmell does it he gives the impression of the large scale battle - without all the fluff. There is a little bit of political intrigue but the meat of the story is the battle, holding the keep from the invading army. I wasn't sure if the book could sustain this battle for as long as it did, but when I finished I could easily see how more could have been written about it and still been fine.<br /><br />I have a few `complaints' about this book, one I won't mention because it's a spoiler. But the other is simply that the ending felt rushed to me. The entire book is building up to the end of this massive large scale battle, only once you get there - it seems rushed and a little disjointed. It's not to say it's a bad ending, just that I think it could have been done better and still gotten where the author wanted to go. I think part of this may be due to this being the first book Gemmell had published at the time (1984), but it bugged me a little bit.<br /><br />With all that said, I think if you are a fantasy fan, even a casual fantasy fan at best, you will enjoy this story. I would highly recommend it.' about this book, one I won't mention because it's a spoiler. But the other is simply that the ending felt rushed to me.

However, there are some new characters to be introduced as it is 20 years after that event Prince Arutha now has twin boys and this story follows them. This story is a departure from Feist's earlier books in this series as there is very little magic in it. In Prince of the Blood the main driving force of the book is politics and intrigue, it almost has the feel of a who-done-it type plot. Normally I don't like the who-done-it books but Feist was able to pull this off with a well developed setting, great characters, and a plot that seemed to always keep you guessing.<br /><br />The characters development in this is again very good, as can be expected with Feist. Since I have started reading Feist's books I have been rather impressed by how well thought-out his characters are. There seems to be very little that is done just for the sake of doing. Each character remains consistent throughout the story, and more impressively, throughout the series. This book centers on the development of two characters, those being the sons of the prince. Each faces different challenges and pitfalls along the way. Each is faced with a different set of circumstances that force them to make decisions. These decisions go a long way in there development. With all of the Feist books I have read thus far, he has a knack for letting his characters show flaws. They are not these all powerful people that some authors have as their characters. The characters in this book get hurt, have doubts, and one goes through a lot by the end of the book.<br /><br />At the start of this book I thought the plot was going to be rather straight forward and almost boring. Yet, the more I read the more complex the plot became. By the last 100 pages of this book the plot is so involved you are not even sure who to believe or at time exactly what even happened (or is going to happen). By the end of the book however, everything is brought to a nice close and it all makes sense. I think a great benefit for this plot is the setting which is richly described and used to its fullest to get the greatest effect.<br /><br />Feist is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors for his ability to weave a good story with good characters. It seems all too often most authors have one or the other and expect it to carry the book - while that can certainly be done - it's much more interesting when both elements are present. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre and have yet to read this book (or any other Feist books) you really should take the time and do so. Remember, to start at the beginning with Magician: Apprentice and follow it through. I think if one were to read this book first you may be a little confused, but not overly much so. All-in-all I highly recommend this. I think it's a must for any fan of the genreng is brought to a nice close and it all makes sense.

I am having a rather difficult time reviewing this book for a couple reasons.<br /><br />First, after finishing this book I tried to reflect on what actually happened in the story - and quite honestly, not much really happened. Pawn of Prophecy is a starter novel in this series and as such it needed to set the stage and establish the characters for the other books in this series. Number two, I came to this book after reading extensively in the fantasy genre and noticed right away that this book was filled with clich&eacute;s involving the fantasy genre. If done correctly and differently this shouldn't be a problem, but quite honestly there is not much new in this book than what can be found in other books. Lastly, the plot is so straight forward that you can pretty much predict what is going to happen.<br /><br />The characters in this book are likeable enough. Well Eddings tries to have a lot of subtle intrigue in this book, it is more akin to getting hit in the head by a brick than tickled by a feather. It's not subtle at all and the things he tries to `fool' the reader with are very obvious as to almost produce groans when they are first presented. With that said the characters do have some clout to being interesting Mister Wolf is by far the most memorable... but he's not the main character. Silk is also a very good character... but he's not the main character. Barak is also an interesting character.. but again he is not the main character, see a theme here. The main character a 14 year old boy is not all that interesting. Maybe this will improve in the following novel; I hope so as I will continue reading just to see what happens in the story.<br /><br /> As I mentioned before the plot in this book is so straight forward it isn't even funny. It screams Tolkien, but doesn't have the degree of depth that Tolkien has. Eddings does add some elements of his own, but the crux of the story has been told before. It's a simple battle between good and evil and a missing artifact that is all powerful. Heard it before? Yeah, so have I. It also needs to be said that at times the dialog in this book is horrid and repetitive. The main character says \\"That is rather involved\\" no less than 5 times within about 30 pages. Change it up a little, get a thesaurus... anything, but give me something different once and awhile.<br /><br />Now, with all that said, if you're still reading, this IS a decent book if you are looking for a light read with not a lot of reader involvement. I liken this book to spoon feeding a child. You say here it is and give it to them. Where as other authors, Salvatore, Erikson, Kemp, Golden etc, make you work a little to get he story. I think this would be an excellent book for someone under 15 or so. That's not to say adults shouldn't read it, but just don't expect an epic world shattering book with this one.<br /><br />I think if I was to recommend this book it would be to the above mentioned audience and just making sure people know what to expect if they read this one. Are there better books on the shelf right now, probably, but I think if you are looking for something to read in a day or two for a nice light tale, this isn't a bad choice.own, but the crux of the story has been told before.

If you have not read the first two books I would highly suggest not reading this book. While it may be considered a novel able to stand on it's own, I think the reader would miss much if they didn't read the first two. On top of that the first two are very good books.<br /><br />This book continues to follow the three main characters Mageire, Leesil, and Chap as they try to discover Mageire's family history, and answer a lot of question hinted at in the first two books.<br /><br />The character development in the first two books was phenomenal and any author would be hard pressed to continue on at that high of level. Here, while the characters continue to develop, Magiere more than any other, the overall development seemed lacking to me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, just not as good as the previous two books. On top of that, there is a love theme starting to play out in this book between Mageire and Leesil that at times seemed out of place and a little forced. I understand it's part of the story, but I just don't think it fits with these characters. I mean, these two are killing vampires and other undead and running around the country looking for Mageire's past... yet they find time to fall in love? Doesn't fit in my opinion. Now, with that said, that part of the story doesn't really detract too much from the overall feel of the book.<br /><br />The plot in this book is rather straight forward in that Mageire want to discover who she is and where she came from, sound familiar? The good thing is, the authors took an overdone plot and made it their own. While it sounds like you have read it before the way they go about it makes it feel fresh and new. The are the requisite plot twists and 'ah ha' moments in this book, but again they are done in a fresh and new way.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was a good book, but not on the level of the first two. I will still continue to read this series as I think the characters and setting are very interesting, but I also hope the authors can make a slight adjustment and switch gears a little. I think this book may be a victim of the past success of the first two books. Maybe I expected too much out of it...<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading about vampires. I think it's a decent read and people should not be diappointed by it.to read this series as I think the characters and setting are very interesting, but I also hope the authors can make a slight adjustment and switch gears a little.

In Dhampir we are introduced tot he three main characters and the story is set into motion. In Theif of Lives the same characters are back again doing what they do best, hunting Vampires.<br /><br />Being that this book is a sequel the authors don't have to devote as much time to character creation as one would in a first book. This is very evident from the start of the book as the authors waste no time jumping right into the plot. If you like action packed books, this is a good one for you.<br /><br />The character development in this book is fantastic! It's nothing short of greatness. Some books have character development as a secondary idea, this book places the development of the characters right up at the top. The story flows very well from the first book into this one. The characters were well established in Dhampir, but in this one they are brought out so much more. I don't want to give anything away, but if like me, you are a fan of Chap, you HAVE to read this book. As a reader I could easily tell that a great deal of time and thought was put into the characters.<br /><br />The plot is just as good as in Dhampir. There is actually two plots in this book, but the second plot doesn't appear until the last chapter - so I'll leave that for you to discover. The first plot it Leesil and Magerie are called tot he capital to investigate suspisious deaths that seem to be caused by a vampire. Once there, they discover that there are indeed vampires in the city and take the steps to kill them. This whole process is wellt hought out and seems logical in all the steps they follow. Unlike some books, the hero doesn't know right where the bad guy is and has to actually 'work' to locate the bad guy. Something I said for the first book applies here again, I really appreciate when the main characters are not flawless and do in fact get hurt, have doubts, and generally go through life. This book provides all those things and more.<br /><br />The first book I read on a recommendation. This book I read because it was worth it. If you have not read Dhampir and are a fan of vampire books, than you really should do yourself a favor and read it. If you have read Dhampir, than you already know what to expect - all your expectations will be met with this book. I highly recommend this book. I can't say enough good things about it.<br /> <br />The first book I read on a recommendation. This book I read because it was worth it.

Before reading this review please be aware that there may be one spoiler that I feel the need to touch on.<br /><br />I must start off by saying I really enjoy Mr. Feist's writting style. It, to me anyway, is easy to read and has a flow to it that makes you want to keep reading. I have mostly read Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms book until recently and am very glad I have expanded my authors as this is a gem that I think all fantasy fans will enjoy.<br /><br />The character development in Mr. Feist's books is very good to sayt he least. As I said in my other reviews of the first three books (Magician: Apprentice, Magician: Master, and Silverthorn) these characters have flaws which make them seem more real. I can cite countless examples of characters from other books who are allpowerful and seldom get hurt much less have doubts and fears. Mr. Feist has the ability to take a scene, and witht he characters get the reader to feel the tension and suspense that so many authors try for but rarely reach. There are several characters through-out these four books that we are able to watch grow, only in this final book do we get a true appreciation for how much they have grown and what they will surely become.<br /><br />The plot in this book is basically a carry over from Silverthorn in that the army amassing in the north is now about to move and they must be stopped, where are they goin and why is the crux of the book - yet this isn't revealed until the last 100 pages of the book which makes it a frantic race to save everyone. I mean frantic in a good way, not a bad way. The book is masterfully done. There are a couple good plots twists along the line, one is fairly obvious, but it detracts nothing from the book when the other characters realize it.<br /><br />Now, on to my spoiler that I feel I need to talk about. If you don't want to read the spoiler skip to the next paragraph. I was very disappointed in one aspect of this book and that was the journey that Pug and Tomas undertook to find Marcos. I realize it had to be interesting, but I think it was over done. Going back to the creation of the universe and coming back, traveling between several world on the back of a dragon... I don't know, maybe it's just me but it lacked the 'right' feel for what needed to happen. I wish it would have been done another way.<br /><br />Now, I always try to end my reviews with either recommending the book or not. In this case it's a resounding yes! If you are a fan of the fantasy genre I am almost positive that you will enjoy this book. However, make sure you read the first three books before reading this one or a lot of the things that happen won't make as much sense.

With this installment Feist picks up where he left off. The best thing about books like this is the author doesn't need to invest as much time and energy setting up the players, as we already know who they are and what they stand for.<br /><br />On to the book.<br /><br />Characters first. I love how Feist writes his characters. To me not one of his characters are all powerful,w ith the exception of Pug. They all have doubts and flaws that effectively make them 'normal'. Jimmy the Hand easily steals almost every scene he is in (at least for me anyway) I really enjoy reading about that character. The other characters in this book all serve a purpose and are well written. Feist has a knack for writing his characters in seemingly simplistic terms, but yet complex outcomes.<br /><br />The plot lie(s) in this book are fairly straight forward. Aurtha is on a quest to save his beloved all the time dogged by a power that he doesn't know. This journey makes for some interesting scenes as well as some harrowing times. I really like how Feist doesn't have his characters just run into a place and start swinging a sword to kill everything, some times stealth serves a better purpose and Feist does this perfectly. The other major plot line is that this rising power in the north and a prophecy the centers around the young prince. The prophecy is hinted at and we are given bits and pieces, but I think it will all come to fruition in the last book. While the plot is straightforward, there is still enough varation to make you want to read and find out what's going on.<br /><br />I try to end the most of my reviews with either recommending the book or not. This book I would recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy. While these books aren't difficult reading they are still a blast to read. I would be willing to bet most people will enjoy this series. Give it a shot, it's worth it.orth it.	2005-09-24

The Preiest books, 4 in all, are a series of stand alone novels about various deities int he Forgotten Realms. With the title of this book Queen of the Depths I knew right away it would be about Umberlee and would focus a lot on the underwater life of the realms.<br /><br />I will talk about the story, plot, first.<br /><br />After reading the prologue I was worried about this book. Right away we are reading about mad dragons underwater attacking a underwater city. I inwardly groaned, as this is the stuff Mr. Byers covers in the Rogue Dragoe series. These are supposed to be stand alone novels - maybe a small time in to another Realms event would have been better - but not the Realms Shaking Event currently taking place. So, I quietly hoped this was an abonimation and the Dragones would be gone, and maybe the plot would focus on the destruction caused and such. No such luck, it centers around the Cult of the Dragon having a secret base and finding it. As with all my reviews I won't give spoilers here, but I just felt people need to know this is almost a continuation of the Rogue Dragon series, just with different characters.<br /><br />The characters were ok at best. Initially, they seemed to be rather deep characters, yet the further I read into the book they never really seemed to develop... they just were. From the time I started the book until I ended it I felt, character wise, that I read a short story because the characters didn't grow or anything. They were simple 2-D cut-outs of characters you could find in a source book. I didn't like them at all. My last complaint about the characters is ***be warned some may consider this a small spoiler***<br /><br />One of the two main characters, Tu'ala'keth is the preistess of Umberlee and all through the book she is cold, unforgiving and accepting of death. The author tries to make her out as a hardass that just does Umberlee's work. Sure, fine, works for me. Yet the last scene of the book what does the author have her do? She HUGS the human that she has basically dragged through all this. She HUGS him... why? Why was this scene there, based on her character this should never have happened. There was a scene ealier in the book where she says she doesn't like to be touched by humans... so she ends up hugging one. Makes no sense to me.<br /><br />All the above is not to say this book doesn't have some value. It's not a bad book, it just has so many flaws that to someone who reads a lot of Fotrgotten Realms books I expected something totlally different than what I got.<br /><br />I try to end my reviews by either recommending the book or not recommending it. For this one I would not actively recommend it to most people, as I think there are better books to read out there. Yet, I will say this, if you are a fan of the Year of the Rogue Dragon series - you should probably read this book. If you are a fan of dragon books you should like this just fine.

First off, if you haven't yet read On Fire's Wing by Christie Golden you need to read that book first to understand what is going on in this book. On Fire's Wing is a great book too so don't worry.<br /><br />Now on to In Stone's Clasp. I need to start by saying that, if you think this is a 'chick' book or a romance novel you are wrong. This is a FANTASTIC fantasy novel. What I said in my review of On Fire's Wing still applies to this book. The world building and character developmet are second to none. It is quite obvious that Ms. Golden has put considerable effort into the world development on this series. It's refreshing to see what she can do.<br /><br />The character development is also top notch. Kevla appears in the first book, On Fire's Wing, and is on of the main characters in this book as well. Her development as a character is still progressing, in fact she makes some monumental choices to further that in this book. Another main character is introduced to us in that of Jareth. Jareth is the Stone Dancer, and needs to make some huge choices and develop as a person. In the two books in this series I have rarely come across characters this 'real'. They make choices that real people would make, they face real fears and uncertainties. They are not the all powerful, hack and slash everything everything in their path type of characters.<br /><br />Now on to the story. The story itself has two parts. The most imediate is that of Jareth's struggle to realize he is the Stone Dancer and all that entails. The second part of the story is a carry over from the first book in tha of the Emperor wanting to stop the Dancers. I don't want to give away any spoilers here, but sufice to say that Jareth's journey is well worth the read and the more I read about the Emperor the more I hate him. I would be willing to bet in the two books in this series we have probably read about 30-40 pages about the Emperor and already I hate that man. Pretty strong emotion for so few pages, I hope that gets across just how good these characters are.<br /><br />Saddly, I have a feeling this book will be overlooked by most, either because they think it's a 'chick' book or simply because they don't know about it. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre and have not read these two books you need to do yourself a favor and read them. They are fantastic reads and I am eagerly awaiting book three, which will probably be out in September 2006. I can't recommend this book enough.an.

That is why I am a fan of these stand alone series Wizards of the Coast is currently doing.<br /><br />This book is a fun, enjoyable, and enticing read. If you are looking for in-depth intrigue and plot twists this is not the book for you. The plot in this book is relatively straight forward and the character development is minimal at best.<br /><br />However, with that said, this book does a very good job of telling the story it is meant to tell. Being this book is part of the Fighters series one would expect there to be a lot of fights - and that is actually what this book delivers. Countless battles forcing the characters to adapt their fighting styles to over come their current opponent.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any spoliers, but if you like undead - specifically vampires you may enjoy this one even more. If you are looking for large spell battles - this may not be the right books for you. If, however, you are looking for non-stop action this is the book for you. This is the first book by Mr. Lebow that I have ever read, but I found it hard to put down due to the constant action.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend this book to any Forgotten Realms fans. If this is what the Fighters series has to offer I will gladly read the next three books.	2005-09-18

While reading Dragonbone Chair the first 200 pages dragged on and on... and on. I almost came close to putting this book down, but read other reviews that said the first 200 pages were rather dull. So, I stuck it out through the multitude of boring scenes.<br /><br />Once you get to page 200 it almost seems like another author takes over. The plot takes off and there is no looking back. You quickly find yourself captivated by the story and characters. Willams does a very good job at getting you to have feelings for the characters, either caring about Simon or hating the king's advisor. I have read books where the plot drives the story and I have read books where the characters drive the story. I think this book is a good mix of letting both, characters and plot, take the story where it needs to go.<br /><br />I read a couple of reviews for this book that stated it is laddened with cliches about fantasy books. First off, I disagree. The only big cliche I found was that of the main character Simon being an orphan. Other than that I don't see what people mean mean. It's a well writtena dn thought out story. Another complaint I read was about the editing of the book. I didn't notice this either. Maybe I was too captivated by the story, or maybe the editing mistakes weren't as glaring as others have made them out to be.<br /><br />As I said before the plot is like walking through tar the first 200 pages, once you get past those pages you are suddenly rewarded for sticking it out with a rich world, and great history. The fight scenes that Williams writes have a sense of urgency about them. It's a different feel thn that of the all powerful hero hacking and slashing through a fight.<br /><br />The one complaint I have about this book is I wish more would have been explained about Simon's dreams and there meaning. I understand this is a trilogy, but there should be some closure to a book. A minor complaint at best.<br /><br />If you have the will to plod through the first 200 pages I highly suggest you read this book. I will certainly carryon with this series.e some closure to a book. A minor complaint at best. <br /> <br />If you have the will to plod through the first 200 pages I highly suggest you read this book. I will certainly carryon with this series.	2005-09-16

I was meremly looking for a vampire novel in a sword adn sorcery setting. What I got was a gem of a book. I will be recommending this book to many people.<br /><br />While the plot is a little rehashed, clint Eastwood The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, comes to mind. The authors do enough of their own tiwst so that it feels like something new.<br /><br />The character development in this book is by far some of the best development that I have ever seen. It's a remarkable transition that all the characters go through in their own little scope, than when you combine each of the characters into the plot it just adds so much depth to them.<br /><br />It needs to be said that these authors are down right mean to their 'heros' they put them so so much you just want to give them a night off.<br /><br />My only 'complaint', for lack of a better word, with this book is at times there seems to be a lack scene description. I don't know if there was at first and it was edited out for word count or what have you, but at times I felt my mind trying to make things up because there was description of the scene/<br /><br />This is a pretty mild complaint for a book like this. So, don't hesitate giving this one a shot if you want a different take on vampire novels.	2005-09-09

Salvatore message board. Someone there reommended that I read Magician: Apprentice. I took him up on the idea and was entranced by what I read. So, I felt safe reading the second book in this Rift-War saga.<br /><br />I am extremely happy to have rad the second book Magician: Master, from the first chapter I was again caught up in the storya nd right away I found myself invested in the lives and well being of the characters. One thing I really like about Feist is that he has a knack for making a section on a sub-plot still seem like it directly affects the main plot. Some authors seem compelled to have sub-plots but when they write them it seems forced and doesn't mesh with the story. Feist's sub-plots go hand in hand with the main plot and seem like they belong.<br /><br />I really enjoy Feist's writing style. It, to me anyway, is a nice laid back style that lends itself well to reading. It seems Feist put a great deal of effort into letting this story flow from the pages. The book is some 490 pages yet once you start reading it you find yourself at the end before you know it.<br /><br />Before I read Feist I mainly read Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance books. Little did I know this gem was sitting out there. I fully intend to keep reading book set in this world by Feist. I now rank Feist up there with some of my personal favorites and I am confident if you give him a chane you will enjoy this book as well. I highly recommend these two books.	2005-09-05

Once this tale is complete, I am under the belief it will be one of the best for a long long time.<br /><br />Now, before I start on this review, know that I loved Gardens of the Moon.<br /><br />In Deadhouse Gates at times I felt like I was being pulled in too many directions at a time. I fully understand that there are multiple plot lines with-in this book, but I'm not sure if having all 6 plot lines in one chapter is the right delivery was the right way to do it.<br /><br />With that said, the vastness of the various plot lines is fantastic. I love the fact that Erikson has no qualms about killing a character if it will better tell the story. Unlike most Forgotten Realms/Dragonlance books, characters shouldn't always 'make it'. There needs to be some reality mixed in and that is certainly present here.<br /><br />I enjoy the richness of the world building that Erikson pus forth. It is fairly easy world to 'see' in your mind as Erikson mixes in a good amount of detail. He toes the fine line of not telling the reader too much detail to let the reader see things how they want to.<br /><br />His character development continues to be very good as well. Although, just when I though I was understanding a character, he went and killed him. Each and every character is a complex individual person with their own ideals of what should happen within their part of the world. Erikson does a great job of mixing these ideals between characters and between plot lines.<br /><br />While I personally don't think Deadhouse Gates is as good as Gardens of the Moon I don't think it's a terrible book either. If fact I enjoyed it quite a bit, except for the pulling in too many directions.	2005-09-04

This is the fourth Eberron book I have read and in all honesty I am really trying to give the world a chance to captivate me. Yet every novel I have read to this point seems pretty bland to me, and doesn't really offer up anything brand new that one would expect for a new world, with new creatures and magic.<br /><br />When trying to decide what to rate this book I was torn between 2 and 3 stars. If I rated it bases solely on the characters it would have been a 2 for sure. The characters did nothing for me in terms of wanting me to keep reading. They are 2-D cut[out characters of what you can expect to find in countless other novels. Their dialog is sub-par for a Bassingthwaite book. In the Forgotten Realms book titled Yellow Silk, Bassingthwaite usued dialog very effectively. Yet, in this book it seemed strained and forced at times. Also, there is a 'new' language that he uses and it detracts from the book. They are kind enough to include a 'dictionary' of sorts in the back, but it's too much of a hassle to keep looking back there to understand what they are saying. It's a decent concept of adding a new language, but it's been done better and more effectively in other novels.<br /><br />However, if I rated it based on the story line and plot I would have rated it higher. The actual story is a good one. There is a great deal of promise behind it. But, what truly drives a story is the characters and how they interact with the environment and quite honestly the characters killed this story.<br /><br />The ending, as can be expected in the first book of a trilogy, left many things unsolved while closing off a few sub-plots.<br /><br />I will probably continue to read this trilogy if nothing else to see how the story progresses and what will happen to a certain character. This is one of the few books that I have ever read that I could care less about all the characters in the book.<br /><br />As far as recommendations go, I would really like to recommend this book as I think the world of eberron is very interesting and detailed, yet it may not lend itself very well to novels. If you are a fan of the first few Eberron books that have been released go ahead and get this one as you know what to expect, if you have not read any Eberron books I suggest you start with the Crimson Talisman by Adrian Cole or the City of Towers by Keith Baker before you jump into this one.book as I think the world of eberron is very interesting and detailed, yet it may not lend itself very well to novels.

The Guardians of the Lost is the second book in the Sovereign Stone Trilogy by Margret Weis and Tracy Hickman. In the second installment the plot is moved considerably forward at the same face pace as was found int he first book. the characters are also more defined in this book and their roles are more clear than in the first book.<br /><br />This world is unlike their Dragonlance books in that they have complete control over what happens and it's noticably a little darker than their other works.<br /><br />The story during the Sovereign Stone Trilogy moves along at a break neck pace. There are multiple twists along the way. I thinkt he thing I like best about this trilogy is that the 'villian' starts off as a good guy for the most part, but with misguided ideals. He doesn't really know he's being evil he thinks he's doing what's best.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles of Death Gate cycle you should give these books a chance. The world if fresh and different from most that is out there today.<br /><br />If you're ready for a new journey, jump aboard and get ready for a fun enjoyable ride.	2005-08-19

This book is a different than most Dragonlance novels as right away fromt he opening scenes it has a really dark feel, which is a nice change of pace.<br /><br />There have been some negative comments about this book, but frankly this is one of the best Dragonlance novels released int he last 3-5 years and a great overall trilogy.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Dragonlance setting and have been disapponted lately with what has been released give this one a shot I think you will be pleasantly surprised.	2005-08-19

Let me first say that this trilogy has a lot of promise. I have always enjoyed reading about the knights of Solomnia... yet, this book just didn't do much for me.<br /><br />It's not a terrible book by any means,but at the same time when you see the name Douglas Niles as the author you some how expect more. Maybe Niles is a victim of his own sucess and this is simply a small bump in an otherwise great writing career.<br /><br />I think some of the problems in this book revolve around editor errors. After all the final say of when a book is printed rests witht he editor. They are the final check and balance for continuity. There are some aspects of this book, where you will read a paragraph and suddenly jump to somewhere else with no warning leavingtohe reader to wonder what just happened.<br /><br />When you get by the editorial mistake the actual story is a very good read. Great action sequences and characters, but the editing will bring down it's overall score.<br /><br />Again, I think with a different edior for the second book, this trilogy has a lot of promise.	2005-08-19

With any first book of a trilogy a good deal of time is spent setting up the story and characters. Mary Herbert does it in a way that doesn't feel like an 'information dump', it feels more like a part of the story, which is a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Th story itself deal with Linsha being a knight and some of the trials a female knoght faces. Yet, that isn't all. Throughout this book there is a good mix of action and story building.<br /><br />The past 3-5 years have been a down time in the Dragonlance world as there hasn't been many 'good' bboks. Yet, Herbert stands tall with a captivating story and a hero that we can believe in.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the Dragonlance world I suggest you pick up this book. Herbert is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. Hopefully you will feel the same.	2005-08-19

Salvatore's War of the Spider Queen, Book 2)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	What a way to keep a story going	For those of you who don't know, the War of the Spider Queen is a series a six book all by different authors covering telling one long epic story. Insurrection, by Thomas Reid is book two in the series book one being Dissolution, by Richard Byers. If you haven't read Dissolution - you really need to before reading this one.<br /><br />On to this book. Reid does a very good job at continuing the story started in the first book. Admittedly, there are a couple 'voice' issues that don't match up with the first, but that's to be expected. Those issues are quickly forgotten once you are into the story.<br /><br />Even though Reid does a good job here at moving the plot forward I think his real strength to the series is how well he continued to flesh out the characters. He truly made them each seem like their own individual instead of a group always doing the same thing. The infighting typical with Drow is in full effect here, and at times leads to rather humorous moments (no spoilers here don't worry). The depth he gives the characters makes it easier in the following books for the other authors to pick up the plot and not worry so much about the character development.<br /><br />If you are a fan of R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf trilogy, or just a fan of the Forgotten Realms you should do yourself a favor and pick up this wonderful series.	2005-08-19

Raistlin is one of the most egmatic characters to grace the fantasy genre. For the first time we are told the entire tale of Raistlin's childhood. All through the Chronicles and Legends series we are given splices and hints of the past, yet to truly read about his past was a fantastic experience.<br /><br />The story in this book moves along at the typicla Weis pace. If you have read the Dragonlance Chronicles or Deatj Gate Cycle you know what to expect from her. Some action, but a some introspection as well. I really enjoyed knowing what Raist was thinking at times, it added more depth tot he character that I have come to love.<br /><br />I read a couple of reviews below this one that were bashing this book, and quite honestly I don't know where they are coming from. They obviously have little understanding of the character and what he later becomes.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the DL Chronicles you really need to read this book.	2005-08-19

Salvatore's War of the Spider Queen, Book 3)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Great story.. not enough time	Let me first say I am a fan of Baker's Last Mythal trilogy. It is one of the best trilogies I have read in a long time and I highly suggest it to anyone looking for something to read.<br /><br />Now, if I was rating this book purely on the story it would receive a much higher rating. However,it seems an editor (or two) fell asleep while working on this book with Mr. Baker. There are a couple instances where characters do things that counteract what they did before, or things they shouldn't have had to do in the first place. But, we're all human and everyone makes mistakes I can look past that.<br /><br />My second complaint is this book seems like it should have been around 400 pages. Yet, it is stuck within the typical Wizards of the Coast word count and reined in at 315-350 pages. There is just too much story to tell here in that frame. Yet, Baker does the best he can and continues the plot moving forward. He has a knack for writing believable battle sequences. He also makes the characters more believable in this novel, continuing the work of the first two authors in this series.<br /><br />I have alreay finished all six books inthis series before I wrote this review giving me an overall look att he series and not a microscopic look at one particular book. When looking at it from a series perspective this book does a good job of continuing the story.<br /><br />Definatley a must read for any fans of the Forgotten Realms.	2005-08-19

After all, four books for the price of one you really can't go wrong.<br /><br />As with the Sword of Shanara trilogy I was not disappointed t ll with these books. They tell an epic tale, with believable characters and a unique setting that makes you just want to keep reading. I have heard from others that the Heritage series is the pinicale of writing for Brooks so I have yet to purchase anything beyond this series.

I had never heard of Feist until about a month ago on a message board where I was looking for something new to read, aside from my usual Dragonlance and Forgotten Realm books. I was given two recommendations: 1) Gardens of the moon by Steven Erikson and 2) Magician: Apprentice by Raymond Feist.<br /><br />I have finished Gardens and loved it, now I am almost done with Apprentice as well.<br /><br />In Magician: Apprentice we are introduced not only to the main players in the book, but a rich and detailed world. It is obvious from the start that Feist put a lot of tim and effort into making a believable world. Also, I am simply amazed at how well he can describe the characters in his book. Anywhere from the main character Pug (what a name!) to passing characters who are so minor you may forget about them, but each is richly described so as to give the reader the impression that they ALL matter to the story.<br /><br />When you read the title of this book, Magician: Apprentice, you expect to see spell duels and the growing power of a young mage. Nope. The spells that are tossed around in this book are so few and far between that when a spell is cast you know it is something special. this is unlike Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms in that they aren't casting fireballs and the like right away. I am assuming that downt he road spells will become more important, but they are certainly not the focus of this book.<br /><br />I simply can't believe this is the first time I have heard about this book, I wish I had earlier, but now I can enjoy these book for the first time. I plan of reading this entire series.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!	2005-08-19

The way Herbert concludes this trilogy is just fantastic. I was enthralled the entire time I was reading this. The first book in this series was a good read, the second book was decent, but this book blows the doors off of either of the first two. It's a fantastic book and one I would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Mary Herbert has staked her clain to the Dragonlance world with this trilogy. She certainly stands above a lot of the recent sub-par books that have been released. Rest asured this book is int he upper teir of recent Dragonlance novels.	2005-08-19

This book is the sequel to Knight of the Black Rose. Once again Lowder does a masterful job of telling the story of Lord Soth and what makes him tick. Past book about Lord Soth focus on him being a supreme villian and the history of his 'transformation' into a Death Knight. Yet, in this book, Lowder does a very good job of getting inside Soth's head and letting the reaer know what he is thinking.<br /><br />Unlike the first Ravenloft book about Soth this one has a little more intrique in it. There is a mystery in this book that Soth is continually faced with, just who is the White Rose? Fans of the Dragonlance Chronicles will understand this subplot the more they read about it.<br /><br />Lowder again proves that he can create interesting characters and stories behind those characters with seemingly very little effort. The Bloody Cobbler being one of the most interesting Ravenloft characters I have ever read about. I wish he would have gotten his own book, but alas we don't always get what we want.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Dragonlance books I highly suggest you pick up this book and give it a shot, I don't think you will be disappointed.	2005-08-19

The first book in this trilogy was dark by Dragonlance standards and this novel is no different. I am enjoying the 'darkerside' of Krynn if you will. It seems the books that have been released as of late in the Dragonlance world have been sub-par to say the least. With his first novel in this trilogy Night of Blood, Knaak broke that mold and delivered a very solid book. This second book keeps that theme going and is well written and well thought out story.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Knaak's since I read Kaz the Minotaur and he doesn't disappoint here. It is evident that Knaak has planned out this story in great detail and taken the time to think everything through as far as what he would like to happen.<br /><br />As far as the story there is a good deal of action mixed in with the politics of the Minotaur empire. For a Dragonlance novel I was a little surprised of the politics as that's not usual for DL novels.<br /><br />Overall this is a very solid second book and one that will surely carry right into the final book in the trilogy.	2005-08-19
US	33347828	R1MVLJCD0WTCPX	1560763302	515188498	The Ring of Winter	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Fun, enjoyable ride	Ring of Winter is book number 5 in the Hapers series. The Harpers series is a group of stand alone novels all dealing with the Harpers organization in the Forgotten Realms. You don't necessarily need to read the first book to jump right into the series. The Harpers series is also a good way to get aclamated to the Forgotten Realms, think of it as a test drive for the world if you will.<br /><br />In Ring of Winter, James Lowder tells the story of a young treasure hunter who's journey takes him half way around the world. The hero faces numerous challenges along the way as he tries to find the myth of the ring. It almost has an Indiana Jones type feel to it, except on a grand fantasy stafe.<br /><br />I must say, that this book involves two of my favorite all time characters, the talking wombats... what's not to like about talking wombats? :-)<br /><br />In all honesty, James Lowder proves with this book that he is one of the best Forgotten Realms writters in a long time. The tale he weaves is just a fantastic read. He has a good mix of action, suspense and humor... all combining to make an enjoyable book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the fantasy genre.	2005-08-19

Wies and Hickman have a knack for bringing home the story at the end of trilogies. I've read some authors where the third book is the worst in the series. Not the case here. This book finishes up the story in grand fashion and I can honestly say that I wouldn't have ended the story any other way.<br /><br />This world is unlike their Dragonlance books in that they have complete control over what happens and it's noticably a little darker than their other works.<br /><br />The story during the Sovereign Stone Trilogy moves along at a break neck pace. There are multiple twists along the way. I thinkt he thing I like best about this trilogy is that the 'villian' starts off as a good guy for the most part, but with misguided ideals. He doesn't really know he's being evil he thinks he's doing what's best.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles of Death Gate cycle you should give these books a chance. The world if fresh and different from most that is out there today.<br /><br />If you're ready for a new journey, jump aboard and get ready for a fun enjoyable ride.	2005-08-19

Salvatore explores another new world in this book the first book in the Crimson Shadow trilogy. The world is no where near as developed as his world of Corona (Demon Wars), yet at the same time the story isn't as deep and moving either so it makes sense.<br /><br />Fans of Salvatore looking for another 'Drizzt' novel here will probably be disappointed. This book, and trilogy, are meant as a light fantasy read and that is exactally what you get. The story is well told and the characters are well fleshed out. I may even go so far as to say this trilogy has one of the best Salvatore characters ever made in that of Oliver, but I'll let you be the judge of that.<br /><br />This book is fast paced and has enough action to keep everyone interested. There aren't as many plot twists as with Salvatore's other work, but I think that was intentional here as well.<br /><br />If you are new to the fantasy genre, or are looking for something different to read from your favorite author. Give this one a chance. Be careful not to expect too much from it though. Take it at face value and you will really enjoy the ride.	2005-08-19

Kemp is introduced to the Forgotten Realms as a voice that will be here for a long time. Kemp exploded onto te Forgotten Realms scene with a dark and gripping story of a butler with a terrible secret that he is keeping from the family he serves.<br /><br />This is unlike most Forgotten Realms novels in that it is much darker thant he usual nevels that are being released.<br /><br />Kemp has a knack for creating three dimensional characters and fleshing them out and every opportunity he can. The story line is simply fantastic. I can't say enough about that.<br /><br />I would be remise if I didn't say that if you enjoy this book and the story of Cale you would be well served to look for Kemp's Everis Cale trilogy, the third book is coming out in November of 2005 and should prove to be a great conclusion to the trilogy.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Realms or someone who is considering the realms this is a must read.	2005-08-19

Knight of the Black Rose follows one of Dragonlace's best known villians as he finds himself int he Ravenloft world trying to get out. Those of you familiar with the Dragonlance Chronicles will undoubtedly know the name of Lord Soth the Death Knight. The scene stealer of the Chronicles books.<br /><br />In this book, Soth has been given a new voice by James Lowder. Lowder proves that he has a knack for darkf antasy with his first Ravenloft novel. Lowder proves he is the perfect writer to write this dark fantasy novel.<br /><br />There is nothing cliche about this book, in fact it breaks the rules of good vs evil. After all, there is no 'good' guys in the Ravenloft world. There is the bad guys, the the worse guys. It's a very interesting take on the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Lowder has proved over the past couple years that he is a voice to be listened too. I believe right now he is one of the best kept secrets to the writing world. Once his name gets out his popularity will surely explode. Treat yourself to agripping tale and read this book.	2005-08-19

I am very pleased a friend recommended this book to me. Three books for the price of one, what could be bad about that right?<br /><br />Before I get into the 'real' review of the book I have to say this. I have heard, and read a couple of reviews about this being a direct rip off of the Lord of the Ring trilogy. Frankly, I don't see it at all. In fact I will go so far as to say i hated the LotR books, they were dry, boring and overall a waste of my time. Yet, this trilogy was gripping, well paced,had believable characters,a nd just an ovrall great story.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this trilogy of books. The characters weren't the usual faire of all powerful, nothing can go wrong type character. They had their doubts about what was going on and they all had their flaws - which to me made them more 'real'. There were times during these books that I actually cared for the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen. It's truly a gripping tale and a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />A must for any fantasy fan.	2005-08-19

As with the past three books in the series, each book is written by a different author so there is a slight variation in how the characters talk, act, react etc. but, that is quickly forgotten here.<br /><br />Smedman moves the plot along at a brisk pace and leaves the reader little time to sit back and think about what's going on (in a good way). There are some authors that have a major scene happen only to let the reader digest it over the next 100 pages because nothing else significant happens. Not the case here, as the author is constantly bombarding us with things that we need to know not only for this book but the last two books as well. She does a masterful job at combining all the material that has been written before this book.<br /><br />Thw War of the Spider Queen is proving to be some of the best work done in the Forgotten Realms in a long time. I am a big fan of the series.	2005-08-19

Answer - Chaos	This is one of the finest books depicting Drow when they are not fighting. The various levels of intrique and hate and well written. There also some fantastic battles don't get me wrong, but if you ever wanted to know what Drow where thinking this book is for you. Athans does a gret job of getting in their head and letting us not only know what they are thinking but also WHY they are thinking that.<br /><br />There are a couple plot twists in this novel as well as all the novels that passed before this one. There is one twist in this book that most everyone will see coming, yet there is another that not many will see coming and will leave you with a sense of loss.<br /><br />This is a great book to continue the storys of the main characters, but not do too much too soon.<br /><br />My one complaint with this series is that I had initially thought one of the reasons they were doing this was to get new authors introduced to Forgotten Realms fans. Yet the last two books in this series are being done by Athans and Kemp, both who have been around for years. Did they not trust anyone else to finish the story/ Couldn't they find anyone else? I would have liked to have seen the new author trend continue here.	2005-08-19

Kemp proves he was the right choice to pen the final installment in the War of the Spider Queen series. He takes the plot right where it needed to go, and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the lives of the drow are truly chaotic and unpredictable.<br /><br />I read a few of the review bashing Kemp's work on this novel and disagree that it 'ruined' the series, or was anti-climatic in the least. In order to appreciate this book int he fullest you need to consider what the Drow are and how chaotic their lives are. Kemp showed us the chaos in a rather convincing fashion. Also, some of the things people are complaining about Kemp had little choice over as they were agreed upon before the first book was written.<br /><br />The plot is tied up rather nicely and leaves a host of challenges ahead for Lloth and her minions. Cheif of which is that the males of the Drow race are begining to realize that they too hold strength in their society and don't necessarily need to have un-question servatude to the females. THAT is the Realm Shaking Event here. The Drow race will be changed forever with this series of books.<br /><br />People are also complaining about characters dieng. Why shouldn't characters die? It progressed the story and each death was well thought out and executed with perfection. If every main character in every book never died the Realms would be full of a lot of characters. Fact is, some characters need to die to progress the plot and that's what happened here.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a fantastic conclusion to a grand story.	2005-08-19

This story is well written and well plotted out to get the maximum effect of the tale.<br /><br />As with the other books of this series you don't need to have a vast knowledge of the Dragonlance world to understand this trilogy.

Along come Taladas, a new continent not yet explored - or even knew about in the world of Krynn.<br /><br />It took me a little while to get used to some of the nuances of the continent such as the different names for the gods and the 'altered' races. Once you come to grips with the changes the novel moves on at a brisk pace. I was surprised the book was over 400 pages, typical Dragonlance books average 300-350. Good to see they are allowing a little more in terms of word count.<br /><br />I hesitate to give this book a perfect 5, as that would mean it was perfect and there was nothing to improve on. I think Pierson, is one of the up and coming Dragonlance authors. Yet, I think some of his dialog in this book seemed forced - at times it felt like the same character was talking when in fact it was a completely different character.<br /><br />I think this series has great promise and one that I will follow for sure.	2005-08-18

I bought it thinking it was the latest in a line of Dragonlance books that had been, as of late, sub-par. Yet, what I read was truly a diamond in the rough. I am guessing this book (and trilogy) will be overlooked by many readers.<br /><br />This first book, covers a rather extended period of time. We start with a 10 year old boy and end with a man attached to a Horde. To some, this may be too long of time frame, but in the current story line it's an appropriate time lapse.<br /><br />I can't say enough things about this book. It's a truly a captivating read. The story is a great mix of action and character development. I also like the fact that this trilogy covers a little know part of the creation of Krynn, that being the Horde wars.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book and are a fan of the Dragonlance setting, you really should treat yourself to thsi fine book.	2005-08-18

The Sembia series is a series of books that intriqued me fromt he start. An interesting concept having a bunch of authors write books about the same cast of characters for the most part. Yet, this book stuck out in the series to me.<br /><br />It's a fantastic take on werewolves int he Forgotten realms setting. When you really think about it there haven't been a lot of book in the Forgotten Realms dedicated to Werewolves or Vampires. Yet, this one tackles werewolves in grand fashion. The plot is seemingly easy to understand until you get deeper into the book and it starts to get more complex.<br /><br />The character development through out the book is very subtle, but effectively done. I also like how the main character, Talbot, is not the typical hero in that he has doubts and he's not perfect, he has flaws. He's not all powerful, he can be hurt. Truly a great character to read about.<br /><br />Fans of the Forgotten Realms will enjoy this book.

I picked up this book based solely on Christie's recommendation at a message board she participates in. To be quite honest, I was a little aprehensive about reading this. Yet, right away those fears were put away as I quickly became captivated by this book. The world building alone is worth the read. Christie obviously put a lot of work and effort into not only the physical world, but also the lore and magic system of the world as well.<br /><br />Character building and development is also well thought out and the character development through out the book progresses at a easy pace that doesn't leave the reader feeling rushed.<br /><br />Now, onto the plot. The plot, as with everything else about this book, is well thought out and you can tell Christie put a great deal of thought and effort into what needed to happen and when. Also, it seems apparent that Christie doesn't have things 'happen' for no reason. Everything that happens in this book is there for a reason.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. Unfortunatley, this book will probably be ovrlooked by a lot of people, and quite frankly that is there loss.

Reid has cemented himself in the Forgotten Realms, as one of hte best new authors in the Realms.<br /><br />In The Emerald Scepter, Reid completes The Scions of Arrabar trilogy. Reid has the knack of making characters that are believable and 'real'. They are not the all powerful type heros, they actually have flaws and doubts and that, to me anyway, makes them more interesting.<br /><br />From the opening scene int he book, Reid picks up right where he left off in the second book, The Ruby Guardian. The action in this book is almost non-stop. The plot line moves along at blazing speed - just daring the reader to put the book down.<br /><br />Reid does a very good job of describing the setting of his books. This becomes very evident later on in this book when one of the heros, Vambran, undertakes a quest (no spoilers here don't worry). The way Reid describes his scenes puts the reader right there, which seems to be a dwindling art as of late in a lot of books I have read.<br /><br />I could go on and on reviewing this book and still not do it justice. It's a fantastic book and a great end to the trilogy. It is one of my recent favorites. I look forward to Reid's future projects.	2005-08-17

Don't get me wrong, that's not to say that there aren't a couple good points to this book, but in this novel they are few and far between.

I also liked how he developed the characters beyond those that have been established in the previous Realms novels.<br /><br />There was nothing about this book that made it seemed forced in any way (unlike some of his other books).<br /><br />Overall, this was an enjoyable read and one that I think many fans of the Realms will enjoy.	2005-08-16

For someone of Tracy Hickman's clout I expect bigger and better things. Maybe Hickman is a victim of his own sucess.<br /><br />The concept is of high design, but the follow through and the actual story are anything but. Some have said the first half of the book was difficult to read. I didn't think so. I think it was merely the author trying to set up the new world and make sure allt he descriptions were there. They did a good job of buildingt he world, for that there can really be no arguement. Yet, when it came time to implant the characters... well... there was nothing in them that drew me in and made me WANT to read about them. I finished the book out of respect for the author, and I'll probably finish the series (with greatly decreased expectations).<br /><br />I hate to say this, but there is really nothing special here. If you're looking for a new world to read about there are better ones out there.

When I finished it I had to sit back and just say \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />Witht he second installment of the Dragonvarld Trilogy, Weis adds to her legacy as one of the best fantasy writers in the genre. She advances her story at such a fast pace you feel almost like you are part of it, truly a great feel when reading a book.<br /><br />The setting of this book is by Weis' own design and as such there are no limitations to it, which she does - she pushes the envelope of both her characters as well as the setting and this creates a fantastic read that I'm sure most fans will enjoy.<br /><br />It's important to note that you really need to read the first book in this trilogy before attempting this one - otherwise you will miss some things thatw ill prove important later.<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting the third book in this trilogy. It's sure to rank up there as one of my favorites.	2005-08-16

Now, int he first War of Souls book - I wasn't a fan of Mina. Yet, by the third book I was intriqued at what would happen next, so I decided to pick up this book.<br /><br />I am quite pleased that I grabbed this book. The story of Mina takes some unexpected turns, I won't go into them as they would be spoilers. Sufice to say that Wies does a masterful job of weaving this tale into one that Dragonlance readers will enjoy.	2005-08-16

This is the second novel ever released for the world, so it comes with some unusually high expectations.<br /><br />So far, I have found nothing really to grab my attention in the Ebberon world. This novel is rather bland. Yes there is a plot here, but it seems so forced and contrived that it doesn't seem like a story.<br /><br />When I read a fantasy novel, I don't like to have things handed to me. I don't like a book that's rushed - and to a point that's what this book turns out to be is a very rushed novel at times. The entire concept of the girl getting kiddnapped was a great start, but the more times the main character 'loses' her the more it feels like the author couldn't think of anything new to add to the story.<br /><br />While this wasn't the worst book I have ever read - it wasn't the best either. I would like to recommend this for a brief time waster, but I'm not sure I could even recommend this book for that...	2005-08-15

I wasn't sure if clerics could carry books the way mages and fighters have traditionally done. Yet, on the heals of the Rogues series I decided to give this a shot.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun fast paced book. Granted, as others have said, the writing and editing wasn't the best - but I don't think editing mistakes is a reason to downgrade a book.<br /><br />The main character has a very interesting story one the easily captivates the reader, the story is gradually told throughout the first half or so of the book. The supporting characters are just as interesting.<br /><br />The author does a very good job of scene description and character development throughout the story. It's fairly easy to feel invested in this story.<br /><br />Overall, I'd receommend this book to most people. If you enjoy Forgotten Realms books I think you will most likely like this one.	2005-08-15

This is a very captivating book. The plot is fast paced and moves along at a decent speed while at the same time having very good character development.<br /><br />If you are looking for a hacka nd slash style of book, this is not it. In fact I will even go so far as saying this book breaks away from the normal style of the Forgotten Realms book, but not in a bad way.<br /><br />I was a little sceptical of this series, but those thoughts were quickly stymied in about 20 pages as I became captivated by this book.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Forgotten Realms, or are looking for a book to jump start you in the Realms give this one some serious consideration.	2005-08-15

For those of you who don't know a RSE is an event told in a book or series of books that will change the Forgotten Realms for ever. Wizards of the Coast doesn't usually tell the reader's when a RSE is occuring it keeps things 'interesting'.<br /><br />This trilogy of books has a very interesting premise in that the most powerful mortal creatures in the Realms, Dragons, can't control this rage that happens and they don't know when it's coming.<br /><br />This is definitally and action packed book, and most likely trilogy. Byers does a very good job of helping the reader get inside the various dragon's heads and know what it 'feels' like to experience the rage. He moves between scenes effectively and with little thought of \\"What just happened.\\"<br /><br />However, I have one complaint with this trilogy thus far. I would have liked more information on the various types of Dragons that seem to be appearing aside from the traditional dragons. It seems like every 20-30 pages a new type of dragon emerges that I have never heard of. I am not a gamer I only read the novels set in the realms and have no idea what some of these dragons are.<br /><br />Other than that this is a very well written book and sure to be an interesting trilogy.	2005-08-15

Richard Byers holds up his end of the bargin writing a fast paced enjoyable book.<br /><br />There is nothing too complex about this book. Yet, there are a series of minor twists set within that make you start to think that the story may be more than what you first thought.<br /><br />The characters are well described as is the setting where the story takes place.<br /><br />I think the most enjoyable thing about this Rogue series thus far is that the main characters are flawed and as such the reader can relate more to them than the all powerful character that seems to be in most book lately.<br /><br />A very good read.	2005-08-15

While this isn't the best book in the Priests' series I don't think it is a terrible book. In fact as I was reading it I almost flet like the author was learning a few things as we went.<br /><br />The plot had definite reason to it. At no time did I feel like I didn't know what was going on. The character development could have been better at a couple points, but nothing that detracted significantly from the book. I really enjoyed the setting in the story where the author takes us 'off the beaten path' so to speak and does soemthing with some races that hasn't been done before.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this book to people who have read others in the priest series. I think it's worthwhile to learn about a newer god int he Realms.  Not a bad read.	2005-08-15

I must say when I first opened the first book of this trilogy I was a little aprehensive. 20 pages into I was amazed and that amazement carried over tot he second book as well. Baker does a fantastic job yet again with this book.<br /><br />The thing I really enjoy about this book is the elves seem like elves. They are more concerned with themselves than what is happening to the humans. This book does a great job of touching on the political aspect of the elven societies.<br /><br />There are countless other things I enjoyed in this book, but if I listed them here I'm afraid I'd post spoilers and I don't want to do that. This is a very good read and I'm looking forward to the final book of this trilogy.	2005-08-15

As such parts of the story need to be moved along and things set up for what will surely be a great final installment.<br /><br />Byers follows through on all accounts and does a fantastic job of keeping the story going without recycling things used in the first book. As you read this one you can sense things coming to a head in the next book. You can almost anticipate what is going to happen in book three, the the second you do there is a twist that makes you rethink all that you thought before.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a very good middle book and makes me eagerly anticipate the third in this very good trilogy.	2005-08-15

I don't want to post spoilers here, but there are some interesting twists involving the main characters that play a big part of the plot down the road.<br /><br />The author does a very good job of moving this story along with the right mix of action, details and setting descriptions. Also, some of the things the author adds are rather unconventional and therefore makes the book very interesting. He tends to go against the grain in a couple of areas, and for that I applaud the author.<br /><br />This is not the type of book that you see rehashed and rehashed over and over again, this is something new and interesting. Give it a shot if you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms.	2005-08-15

A number of things that could be positive in books to come. Things such as; warforged, dragon marks, air ships, etc. I won't go into detail here, but they are rather intesting. I think there may be some good things to come for Ebberon.<br /><br />Now, on to the novel. The City of Towers is basically an introduction tot h world for readers, and as such it needs to give the reader a great deal of background information. This detracts (at times) from the flow of the novel as the author is forced to explain things to us instead of assuming we already have been exposed to it.<br /><br />The overall plot and story is so-so. Now I say that with some hesitation as it's the first book of a trilogy so the story may progress more in the next book. There are some interesting characters that could make the next two books in the trilogy enjoyable to read, but at times they seem like card-board cut out and just go through the motions. I wasn't impressed with Baker's descriptions of action scenes at all.<br /><br />While this book won't rank as one of my favorites it's a good introduction to the world of Ebberon and this trilogy should be watched for future novels and see if Baker can get any better.	2005-08-15

Bolme does a fine job with his first novel.<br /><br />This novel is set in a place that hasn't been written about before, which allows the author to flesh it out as he wants to and not rely on what others have done.<br /><br />I was impressed with how 'real' his characters seemed. They weren't over the top like some characters can be. It was refreshing to read characters that had flaws and weren't all powerful.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a very good start to these stand alone novels.	2005-08-15

It seems ( of the 6 people that have reviewed this book) that most don't like it. I'm not really sure why. To me this is the best written Ebberon novel to date (ok, so there's only three right now) but still...<br /><br />I have been trying to give the world of Ebberon a chance. The first two book in this world did very little for me. So, with some trepidation I picked this one up, and was pleasantly surprised by the rishness of the characters, the story, and the plot line along with it's various twists.<br /><br />I read one review that disliked the names in the book. To me Vaddi while an uncommon name (aren't most fantasy names uncommon?), seemed 'right' for the character. I have no qualms about the names.<br /><br />Onto the book. Right away the reader is emersed in the story. It almost felt like when you turn on a movie and miss the first ten minutes.. so much is happening that you're not sure where the story is going. Yet, I think Cole did this on purpose and with great effect. There are some things that the author intentionally keeps from the reader until later in the book. This makes the reader more invested in the story.<br /><br />This is the first novel I have read by Cole and would gladdly read another.	2005-08-09

I haven't stopped reading since.<br /><br />This novel jump starts the world of Krynn and the Dragonlance franchise. I was never a 'gamer' so I didn't have any preconceived notions on what to expect. Yet, what I found was a rich world, with facinating characters.<br /><br />The entire story takes place over three book, this being the first book it has a few things to 'set in motion', some of which you don't fully appreciate until the last pages of the third book.<br /><br />During this trilogy you will laugh, you will cry and you may be so mad you will slam the book down only to come back later. These books are a roller coaster ride that which is rarely seen in the fantasy genre. Weis and Hickman do a seemless job of combining their writing talents to to captivate the reader into reading well past 3 AM when they need to be at work by 7 AM!<br /><br />If you are comtemplating reading this trilogy, give the first book a shot.

Garden's of the Moon is the first book of his i have read and I am amazed at his ability to tell a story. Finding a new author you enjoy is a great gift indeed. I liken it to cleaning your couch and finding a $20 under a cushion.

I attribute this to a couple things - 1) She is setting up pretty much a new race and needs to fully explain the nuiances of the race. 2) Not many books have been written about the 'powers' used in this book - so again more explanation is needed. 3) Just a new part of the Realms, so again more explanation.<br /><br />Once you get through all the description and explanation there is actually a good plot/story in this book. The characters seemed a little forced at times, but overall they are well written.<br /><br />Well this certainly isn't the best book I have read written in the Realms, it's not the worst either.

I just finished this book and am happy I read it. However, I have a small feeling of being given only 3/4 of a hamburger when I ordered a full burger. What I mean is this... the book was supposed to (not sure if Salvatore said it or not) tie up some loose ends and bring closure to a few storylines. In my line of thinking only one of the storylines was really moved forward in any substantial way. I won't post spoilers here, but there a few things that may have been written a little differently. But, I don't know the larger scope of storylines that Salvatore has planned so maybe this is for the best.<br /><br />With that being said, the books itself is a great read. Full of action and drama. There are a few twists int he book as well as a couple points where one holds out hope for a single hero... there are a couple memorable deaths in the book. Salvatore is one of the few authors who gets inside the head of the 'bad guy'. If you read the first two books int he trilogy you are sure to want to read this one as well.	2004-10-24
