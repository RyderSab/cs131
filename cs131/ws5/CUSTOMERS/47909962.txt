Books	5	21	21	N	N	Magnificent Expansion	This is a magnificent expansion of Kitses' 1970 book, which looked at the Westerns of Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher and Sam Peckinpah.  It is fine reading for anyone interested in the Western. <br /> <br />Kitses has added a marvelous chapter on John Ford, which examines all Ford's westerns from Stagecoach (1939) to Cheyenne Autumn (1964).  Kitses' comments are sensible and to the point.  His discussion of The Searchers is very well done, and he raises excellent points about The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.  Also, he has written good analysis of Sergeant Rutledge and Two Rode Together, two late Westerns that few critics pay attention to. <br /> <br />Kitses has left the text of his original work alone, except for adding some to the Peckinpah chapter.  While his comments on Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid are perceptive, the Peckinpah chapter is probably the weakest in the book.  I am not sure if Kitses dislikes Peckinpah or if he disliked critics who like Peckinpah. <br /> <br />Kitses then adds two chapters, one of Sergio Leone and one on Clint Eastwood.  The Leone chapter is okay but is far colder than the rest of the book.  However, the chapter on Eastwood is terrific, one that strikes a fine balance between praise for his achievements and an awareness of the flaws in those achievements.  This is perhaps some of the best serious analysis of Eastwood as a director that I have read. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended for all readers interested in Westerns.	2005-09-02

It consists of interviews with John Huston from 1952-85.  Not only does the reader find out about Huston's ideas on filmmaking and get some inside info on the making of classic films, but he will find out about the breadth of Huston's interests, which extended beyond filmmaking to art and philosophy.  Here, truly, was an intelligent man. <br /> <br />The most interesting thing to me about Huston was that he started in the classic studio age and survived its downfall to make films that were fresh, interesting and important even in the Eighties.  These interviews show Huston's mental flexibility.  He admires \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller,\\" \\"Rocky,\\" and \\"Taxi Driver.\\"  Huston is also quite frank about his own films.  I will never be tempted to see \\"Roots of Heaven\\" or \\"Barbarian and the Geisha.\\"  I have to see \\"Moby Dick,\\" which he considered one of his films that never got its due. <br /> <br />I was sorry when this book ended.	2005-07-30

He provides plot summary and critique as to why the film is worth watching.  He uses the idea of the \\"Final Girl,\\" the last person left who confronts and overcomes the killer, to combat the charge of misogyny frequently leveled against slasher films. <br /> <br />Whitehead also admits that a lot of slasher films are junk.  Some of the films he covers, like Nightmare on Elm Street, aren't really slashers (at least in my view).  But he writes in an acessible and enjoyable style that makes this a very helpful short guide to horror films of the 80s and 90s.	2005-07-22

Rigby writes well and is very informative about the development of the British horror film from silents to the Nineties. <br /> <br />Of course, the heart of his book is the era from 1956-74, roughly from \\"The Creeping Unknown\\" to \\"The Wicker Man.\\"  Even if you have read about Hammer films before, Rigby has something new to say.  He has seen EVERYTHING from this era, and his book steered me to fascinating movies like \\"Demons of the Mind\\" and \\"And Now the Screaming Starts\\" that I would never have heard of otherwise. <br /> <br />I don't agree with all of his opinions.  (Rigby is incredibly down on the movies of Amicus Studios.)  But Rigby really appreciates Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Terrence Fisher and Freddie Francis, making this a fun, informative read. Horror fans could only do themselves a favor by buying it.  A most enjoyable book and one that the reader will go back to many times.	2005-07-14

It is not a conventional biography.  Peter Conrad covers Welles' career by looking at the various archetypes that Welles played/embodied/wrote about during his career:  boy genius, Faust, Falstaff, etc. <br /> <br />It takes a while to get used to the book.  Making a judgment after five minutes is a mistake.  Once you get into Conrad's groove, leaping from Welles' radio work to stage, to movies in the space of a chapter makes sense.  He shows how echoes of \\"Citizen Kane\\" recur in later Welles' projects, and how unrealized things like \\"Heart of Darkness\\" influenced the projects Welles was able to pull off. <br /> <br />The best thing about the book was that it covered all of Welles' career, instead of saying:  \\"And after RKO took 'Magnificent Ambersons' away, Welles became a big fat loser.\\"  Conrad shows there was a consistency and throughlines in Welles' disrupted career.	2005-07-10

It is rare to find a book on the Soviet experience in WWII that isn't as thick as a phone book, but the reader of \\"Stalin's Folly\\" will not feel shortchanged. <br /> <br />Pleshakov takes the reader through the months leading up to June 22nd, showing us the indecision at the top of the Soviet system.  This is probably the most controversial part of the book,as he claims Stalin was thinking about an attack on Germany.   <br /> <br />Then the Germans invade and it becomes impossible to put the book down.  Usually, histories speed through these first ten days, but Pleshakov shows us the persons caught up in this hurricane, particularly the hapless commanders of the Soviet Western and Southwestern fronts, who watched their armies disintegrate.  Some were arrested and shot, others short themselves.  A few, like Zhukov, managed to thrive.  Pleshakov puts a face to the confusion and chaos of this week. <br /> <br />Perhaps the best thing about \\"Stalin's Folly\\" is that it is written to be accessible to the general reader and undergrads.  Most books about the Eastern Front, while very good, tend to intimidate the average American reader.  \\"Stalin's Folly\\" serves as a fine introduction to the Soviet experience in WWII to the American reader who may not even know what role the USSR played in that war.	2005-06-25

(One reason for the neglect of this battle, as the book shows, is that none of the Soviet or German generals was especially famous or that talented.) <br /> <br />My response to the book is mixed.  It is betrayed by its maps, which I found too cluttered to be useful.  Thus when I read that the Soviets had advanced from Hungarian town X to town Z, I really had trouble placing this in any context, as the maps weren't that helpful. <br /> <br />However, the strength of the book is in showing the Hungarian perspective on the war.  The Hungarian army was not thrilled about being allied to the Germans, but they feared Communist rule.  Tragically, their resistance against the Soviets permitted the Arrow Cross fascists to massacre the Jewish population of Budapest.  The eyewitness accounts included in this book on the combat, the massacres, and the struggle to live a normal life during modern urban combat, is invaluable. <br /> <br />The Soviet perspective is slighted, which weakens things.  Until the last chapter, I had the impression that the battle pretty much went as the Soviets wished.  They kept squeezing the Germans and Hungarians into a smaller and smaller quadrant.  Then in the last chapter, the author revealed that the Soviets had intended to capture Budapest FOUR times before they actually took the city.  Yet this wasn't apparent from what he presented earlier. <br /> <br />So \\"The Siege of Budapest\\" is a flawed book, but it is essential for anyone seriously interested in the Eastern Front.	2005-06-21

He makes a very convincing case that this era (1950-70) was the most vibrant and creative in the history of the magazines. <br /> <br />What I appreciated most about this book was that Ashley brought new facts and interpretations to light.  I never knew that the controversy over horror comics hurt the science fiction magazines, nor was I aware of a similar flap over UFO stories in the late 50s.  Also, Galaxy Magazine and Worlds of If, which went out of business in the '70s, were only names to me, but Ashley shows how important they were in earlier decades. <br /> <br />Ashley is not the world's most elegant writer, but he knows his material and brings an enthusiasm that sweeps the reader along.  Anyone interested in the history of science fiction would learn much by reading this book.	2005-05-31

It examined Welles' career not in light of Citizen Kane but through his Shakespeare projects.  This cast Welles in a very different light for me. <br /> <br />Welles tried to make Shakespeare accessible.  To him, Shakespeare should not be something in a glass case at a museum.  Thus he kept shaking up the Shakespeare plays he adapted.  And critics hated him for it.  His film of \\"Macbeth\\" in particular got raked over the coals. <br /> <br />The book shows how Shakespeare was regarded in American culture in the 20th Century and how Welles tried to shape that attitude.  It is a slim book, but it gives the reader very much to think about in an accessible, jargon-free way.	2005-05-31

It has been dismissed as \\"Asian\\" and thus \\"unfathomable by the Western mind\\" or has gotten wrapped up in Cold War attitudes (namely that Part I is pro-Stalinist and \\"bad\\" and Part II is anti-Stalinist and \\"good.\\") <br /> <br />Neuberger's book sweeps away all those preconceptions and looks at how the film was made (in Alma Ata during WWII), what was made, and what was prevented from being made.  As a result, Eisenstein's intentions (and dangerous predicament) in handling such a project come into focus.  He tried to mix sympathy for Ivan, and Ivan's historic mission, with a sense of the tragedy that Ivan's bloodletting meant for Russia and Ivan himself.  Unsurprisingly, this proved too risky a trick to pull off in Stalin's USSR, and the film was taken away from Eisenstein and was shelved. <br /> <br />The book brought back vivid memories of Eisenstein's film, even though I haven't seen it in years.  It made me want to see it again.  This book is essential reading for those interested in Eisenstein, Soviet cinema and how historical figures are used by later generations.  Strongly recommended.	2005-05-26

The author discusses how the film came to be made and the political context that surrounded the film, but the heart of the book is his discussion of the film itself. <br /> <br />Charity's writing here is marvelous, pointing out where the scenes were shot, what was real and what was faked, how the film points back to Westerns and \\"Only Angels Have Wings,\\" and how it differs from Wolfe's book.  While reading \\"The Right Stuff,\\" time will fly by. <br /> <br />This is one of the best of the excellent BFI series.  A real keeper and a joy to read.	2005-05-23

That is new and different.<br /><br />However, much of what he does in this book has been done elsewhere and better (books by Spicer, Naremore, Palmer, and Christopher for example.)  I found the book's organization to be poor.  For example he opens with a discussion of German Expressionism in the pre-1933 era, but then leaps to a discussion of Fritz Lang's films and then Robert Siodmak's films.  Then he has the discussion of French proto-noir.  When he gets to the classic noir era of 1941-58, he has some topics but mostly he does director surveys, and I couldn't see why he dealt with the directors in that order.<br /><br />So if you don't have many books on noir, you may find something of interest here.  If you have read the books I've mentioned earlier, or have the Silver and Ursini encyclopedia, you don't need to get this book.	2005-05-12

They are ignored by books on Film Noir and on Horror Movies. <br /> <br />So \\"Gaslight Melodrama\\" steps in to fill this gap.  Ironically, the book doesn't really analyze the movies but rather how the movies relate to ideas about the Victorian era.  By presenting the Victorian era as dark and scary, they reflected a rebellion against Victorian values, but also played on an audience nostalgia for a more stable past. <br /> <br />When Barefoot talks about specific films, like \\"Gaslight,\\" the 1941 \\"Jekyll/Hyde\\" and \\"House by the River,\\" he is very knowledgeable and interesting.  However, I would have liked more about the movies and how they related to each other and to the horror and noir genres. <br /> <br />This was an interesting book, but it leaves room for more on this subject.	2005-01-24

The author had a whale of a challenge on his hands, since, as he points out, Metropolis has been cut and recut many times since it premiered in Jan. 1927.  In the book, he explains the difference between the different versions and also traces how critical response to the film has changed over the years.  Finally, he also points out the many movies and videos that have \\"borrowed\\" from Metropolis since the 1980s. <br /> <br />The result, to me, was to show Metropolis as not a stuffed classic but a film that is always changing, always spinning off new interpretations, and generating imitators.	2005-01-21

Prince looks at the PCA papers for movies from the early talkies to the start of the \\"ratings system\\" in the Sixties.  He looks at how the films depicted violence, and how they got into trouble with the Code Authority.  (Prince doesn't use the word censor, and he shows he has a valid point for this.) <br /> <br />The result is simply eye-opening.  It will make you want to see Frankenstein, The Public Enemy, Scarface (1931) and G-Men again.  Prince shows how the PCA was especially troubled by violence in horror and gangster films and by edge weapons more than guns.  He also shows how \\"film noir\\" was a sustained assault on the conventions of screen violence handed down in the Thirties.  (Oddly, Prince hardly uses the term \\"film noir\\" although the films he mentions:  The Glass Key, Brute Force, Kiss Me Deadly, are all from the noir canon.) <br /> <br />Not only does Prince tell the history of American screen violence, but he analyzes the techniques by which filmmakers depicted violence.  He never becomes dry or academic as he discusses these films. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended for anyone with an interest in the horror film, gangster movies or film noir.	2004-12-18

Usually, books on Peckinpah focus on his relationship with the Western genre and put The Wild Bunch as his chief accomplishment. <br /> <br />Savage Cinema, however, looks at Peckinpah's relationship with violence and focuses instead on Straw Dogs, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.  Ride the High Country and Major Dundee are barely mentioned, and Stephen Prince viewed The Wild Bunch as something that Peckinpah had grown past in these three later films. <br /> <br />The result was a book that viewed Peckinpah through a fresh set of eyes, instead of one that plowed over the same ground.  I found the book very fascinating and convincing.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that Prince's chapter on the use of montage became hard for me to follow.  But apart from that, this is a very interesting book that shows how Peckinpah was a major filmmaker and different from the \\"ultraviolence\\" of today's cinema.	2004-12-11

He looks at three issues/eras in the western:  silent pro-Indian movies made before WWI, John Wayne B movies of the Thirties, and westerns such as &quot;My Darling Clementine,&quot; which were made in the shadow of film noir.<br />There was nothing about William S. Hart or the &quot;epic westerns&quot; of the Twenties.  Simmons assumes the reader will be fairly knowledgeable about the development of the genre.<br />However, after I got over my initial disappointment, I have to say that I found the book very interesting, even if I didn't agree with Simmons all the time.  He writes in a clear style and has an obvious sympathy for his subject matter.  (But he is by no means blind to problems people might find in westerns.)<br />Of the three sections, I most enjoyed the one on the silents and &quot;My Darling Clementine.&quot;  The latter section, by the way, talks a great deal about post-1950 westerns that refer back to &quot;Clementine.&quot;<br />I strongly recommend this book to those interested in westerns, silent film in general, or John Ford.	2004-07-07

Wood's pleasure in \\"Rio Bravo\\" is apparent on every page.  He points out the similarities between \\"Rio Bravo\\" and \\"Only Angels Have Wings\\" and \\"To Have and Have Not.\\"  He brilliantly demolishes the \\"High Noon\\" left wing- \\"Rio Bravo\\" right wing dichotomy that so many repeat without thinking.  His analysis of key scenes is right on the money.<br />Yet there are flaws.  There is a passage that compares Howard Hawks to Jean Paul Sartre that just didn't work for me.  Likewise, Wood's discovery of a gay context between Dude and Colorado failed to convince.  However, my biggest gripe is that Wood goes on and on about how Feathers is the most vulnerable and touching of Hawks' heroines, and he never mentions the fact that \\"Rio Bravo\\" was co-written by Leigh Brackett, who was a woman!  Indeed, Wood seems supremely uninterested in the circumstances of how the film was made, which bothered me.  It was as if everything just sprang from Hawks' forehead.<br />However, this didn't take away from the fun of the book, which reflects the fun of the movie.	2004-05-14

It goes from the silent era to the end of the studio system.<br />I liked the book because it did not have an anti-Disney axe to grind.  Indeed, I came away with a better understanding of why Mickey Mouse cartoons became &quot;blander&quot; as time passed, as opposed to the wildness of Bugs Bunny and Tom &amp; Jerry.<br />Also very good was the look at the differences between the cartoons of Tex Avery, Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng.  Freleng is usually ignored by studies of this kind (as he mostly is in Michael Barrier's Hollywood Cartoons) so it was a treat to see him receive attention here.<br />No, this isn't a quick read, but if you take cartoons as seriously as regular Hollywood movies, with auteurs and themes, this is an essential book to read.	2004-04-27

Not until Walt Disney shows up does that chapter start flowing.<br />BUT from that point on, until the chapter on UPA, I had a hard time putting &quot;Hollywood Cartoons&quot; down.  Barrier doesn't take the usual perspective on cartoons.  He doesn't care how they appeal to the casual viewer but how they look to the pro.  I didn't agree with all his judgments, but I respect his judgments.<br />I have read several histories of cartoons, and Barrier still managed to surprise me or say something new.  He had the best discussion of the origins of Bugs Bunny I've ever read.  His description of the working of MGM's cartoon studio was fascinating, and his views on Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones showed real insight.<br />Barrier states his opinions strongly.  He doesn't like Fleischer or UPA cartoons, and he doesn't think Friz Freleng is worth a lot of discussion.  (I would disagree about Friz, but agree on the other stuff.)  <br />In all, this was a fine book on this subject, and I am glad I read it.	2004-03-18

Most histories of the Hollywood musical start with 42nd Street and consign the earlier films to a dark, unknowable, unwatchable past.<br />Barrios made this era come to life.  He writes in an engaging, witty style that is a pleasure to read.  He never takes a superior tone to his material, and he makes the reader want to track down and see some of these films.

There is an awful lot of interesting information here on how magazines developed differently in Britain and the US.<br />When Ashley gets to the 1926-50 era, he is marvellous when covering the major magazines.  He avoids overt deification or demonization and seems quite even-handed when dealing with the &quot;Shaver hoax.&quot;  Also, he does not take the route that when John W.

Hutchings writes in a very accessible style, although he points out the various theories of popular film that inform his approach to the career of Terence Fisher, director of Curse of Frankenstein and Horror of Dracula.<br />I could not put the book down.  Hutchings makes the twists and turns of Fisher's career quite compelling, even when he discussed Fisher grinding out cheapo crime films I have no chance of seeing.  Best of all, of course, is the discussion of the Hammer horror films.  Hutchings takes the films seriously and points out levels of complexity there that have been breezed over by most commentators.<br />Strongly recommended for anyone with an interest in Hammer and British horror.  Essential reading.	2004-01-05

I also enjoyed Louvish's books on W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers.<br />What I liked about this book was that it placed Laurel and Hardy in a working context.  The impression I got was that they were not totally responsible for their success.  They needed a team of other performers (Edgar Kennedy, James Finlayson) and behind the camera people (Hal Roach, Leo McCary, the Parrott brothers) to create the comedy gems that we enjoy.  (I found that Louvish's judgments on what the best L &amp; H films pretty much tallied up with mine.)  When the equation began to change, such as Roach getting mad at the duo after &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; and gradually losing interest in their careers, the films ceased being as interesting.<br />I found this a refreshing approach to the material, which too often is &quot;Comedian X was a true genius and everyone else messed with his vision.&quot;  Louvish's book presents a picture of the lives of the two comedians, but also shows how their films were a collaborative process.	2004-01-05

The artwork is lovely, and the story-telling is first rate as well, with the tale taking a new twist every few pages.<br />So if you want an adventure story for children, this one should really hold their attention and make them want to read.	2003-10-17

In a short space he has traced the history of the Titanic sinking in history, with a strong focus on the best film of the bunch, the British &quot;A Night to Remember.&quot;<br />Richards traces Titantic films pre-&quot;Night&quot; and post-&quot;Night,&quot; showing how films of this disaster reflect how people thought of the British.<br />As for the film itself, he gives a very interesting career overview of the director, Roy Ward Baker, and sets the film in the British tradition of realism that became the dominant film style in that country during and after WWII.  He sees &quot;Night&quot; as the end of that tradition.<br />Warning:  Mr. Richards states his opinions very strongly, and he gives short shift to non-realistic British films and current Hollywood attitudes (as exemplified in the 1997 film Titanic.)  These opinions might bother some people, but they don't take away from the quality of this book, which is very informative and highly readable.	2003-09-19

I found this a little dissatisfying, since it was not strictly chronological, but I assume most readers would have a basic handle on Cold War chronology.<br />The chapters on Stalin, Molotov and Khushchev were the most interesting.

She did this because, obviously, there were none made before December 7th 1941, so there are no &quot;lost films&quot; in this genre.  Thus she sees how genre elements come together gradually (the prototype phase), snap into place as a perfect model (the archetype), are used by skillful directors for powerful films that transcend the norm (masterpiece) and then lose their effectiveness and are inverted or combined with other genres to try to attract an audience (decadence.)<br />She looks at combat films from the 1940s to the 1980s, so she doesn't talk about all films made in Hollywood in 1941-5.  If a film doesn't have a lot of combat, she ignores it.  However, she does discuss many films and besides showing how genres develop, she shows how the combat film changed.  The focus on a platoon of average Joes (Guadacanal Diary) eventually gives way to a focus on an elite force (Where Eagles Dare, for instance).<br />A very informative and thought producing book, perhaps the best by Basinger.	2003-07-15

What sets this book apart from most of those is that Schickel focuses on the movies he saw at the time of the war as a child, giving us a double perspective:  the child watching the film then and the adult watching the films again now.<br />Thus there are some gaps.  The young Schickel, unsurprisingly, avoided the Preston Sturges comedies, and so these do not play a big part in the book.  However, what we do get is a believable and convincing look at how the public perceived these films (Hangmen Also Die, The Human Comedy, Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo) at the time.<br />A nice thing is that Schickel, although he makes it clear he finds some of these movies mendacious, never takes a snide, wise guy attitude but remembers his childish delight in these films, while as an adult he can pick out the flaws.<br />The book is not just a look at films of 1941-5.  It is also a memoir, so there is material about growing up and becoming a film critic.  I found this interesting, as Schickel is one of my favorite critics.  (His book on D. W. Griffith is superb.)  However, people only interested in wartime films, and not also in Schickel, might be advised to get it from the library.	2003-06-28

It covers many famous comedians, whose work I had either enjoyed (Newhart, Woody Allen, Cosby) or had encountered here and there (Kovacs, Freberg, Nichols and May).  The book worked as a series of mini-biographies which were compulsively readable, and as a bonus, there were very funny bits in each chapter as he quotes from the routines.<br />There were flaws, but I could live with them.  There were a few errors, and the structure of most of the chapters could have used help.  (The chapters tend to start with an overview of the comedian's essence, then shift to biography.  In some instances, this came across as repetitious.)  Don't expect a history of the era (say for a assessment of how the shift from Paar to Carson affected the direction of comedy.)<br />The most serious drawback to me was that there was no concluding chapter after we had covered all the biographies, because I had a few questions by then and wanted Nachman to try to draw stuff together.  (Chiefly, why did his Fifties comics, apart from Phyllis Diller, tend to fall silent or burn out fast, while the Sixties comics, apart from Bruce and Dick Gregory, seem to go on forever?)<br />Still, this was a very enjoyable book.  My wife is looking forward to reading it, having seen me enjoy it.  I say regard it as a useful overview of an era and not a definitive last word on the subject.	2003-05-29

The volumes in this series on the origins of cinema, the Twenties and the Forties are very good.  This book, however, proved a chore to get through.<br />The big problem for me was that Balio seemed more interested in the movie companies as organizations and less interested in the films themselves.  Compounding this was the fact that he sees the Thirties as a unit, and believes that the division of the decade's films into pre-Code and post-Code, with 1934 as the turning point, is a myth.  Thus, to him, the \\"fallen women\\" films, Mae West comedies, classic gangster films, and horror films all died out because the public was tired, not because of censorship problems.<br />Balio sees filmmaking in the Thirties as dominated by the studios and with directors being hired guns.  Hence there is no real discussion of any directors.  Ernst Lubitsch, Frank Capra and Josef von Sternberg are barely mentioned, except when Balio complains that their films didn't make enough money.<br />Indeed, he seems to have no view of his own about the films.  Instead, he views FILM DAILY and VARIETY as the voice of God.  If they put the film on their 10 best list, it is good, and if they didn't, it isn't worth talking about.  The idea that some films popular in the Thirties are no longer highly regarded or that some films despised at the time have become viewed as classics seems not to interest him at all.<br />If someone who had no idea about the history of American film read this book, he would come away thinking that the \\"Golden Age of Hollywood\\" was a myth and these films were artifacts not worth seeing.	2003-03-26

Here he writes not only about movie musicals but Broadway musicals.  He maintains a high level of quality on both fronts.<br />Given the two large subjects he has to cover, Mast wisely focuses on the key figures instead of trying to exhaustively cover everything.  (I think he gives about 5 pages to early movie musicals, something that Barrios' &quot;A Song in the Dark&quot; devotes its entire length to.)  However, this approach pays off tremendously thanks to Mast's wise insights.  He shows how the movie musical in its heyday (42nd St. to Gigi)differed from the Broadway musical.  (He is very interesting on why Rogers and Hammerstein musical films don't work, except for Sound of Music.)<br />Also good is that Mast explores the movie musical beyond Gigi.  His discussion of &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; and &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; are very perceptive.<br />With musicals supposedly &quot;coming back,&quot; this would be a good book to make one acquainted with their historical tradition.	2003-02-15

The photos are great and really give the reader a desire to see these gripping, strange films.  The text, however, made me want to put the book down and read something else.<br />Perhaps the problem is that the book was written in French and translated into English, but the text did not flow.  I was aware of having to work at reading this prose.  The chapters did not especially seem to build on each other but seemed to leap from topic A to C to E then back to B.<br />Kracauer's \\"From Caligari to Hitler\\" is a far better overview of this era.  \\"The Haunted Screen\\" will make you aware of some very interesting films, but it is best to treat it as a picture book and not a text to be read from cover to cover.	2003-01-22

I had trouble putting the book down.  It reads very quickly and is not dull or academic in the least.<br />The one drawback I found was that the book is not as focused as Louvish's bio of W. C. Fields, but then here he is following five people as opposed to one.<br />Still, this was a very good book.  I liked the way Louvish challenged some old stories about the Marx Brothers, and I liked the way he made a case for Chico being the chief &quot;behind the scenes&quot; brother in business matters.  His assessment of the films seemed quite fair to me, and I found it interesting that the Marxes (or their writers) originally intended &quot;Duck Soup&quot; to be more political, and that they made it after plans to film &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; fell through.<br />Still, this is perhaps not the best &quot;first book to read&quot; on the Marx Brothers.

It is nice to see someone discussing Lewton from a film noir perspective.  Also, Christopher left me burning to see Breakdown, a 1965 film dealing with a scientist's mental crisis that he makes sound fascinating.<br />He also does a good job talking about more famous noirs, particularly Criss Cross, which he examines from the Dan Dureyea character's perspective.  That brings a fresh approach to his discussion of this classic film noir.<br />This should not be anyone's first book on film noir, but it takes interesting positions and makes the reader look at things differently.

There is one on John Farrow, who is usually overlooked, so it is good to see his films grouped together and examined.  The essay on Anthony Mann's noirs is quite strong, and Ursini's article on noir TV, shows such as &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive&quot; is very interesting and makes one wish that there were more written on this part of TV history.<br />I think this would be an essential part of any noir fan's library.	2002-12-08

For example, he found a lot more to like the the Lumet-Fonda \\"The Morning After\\" than I did.  Curiously enough, even when Hirsch criticized a film I liked, I didn't find him annoying.<br />The book begins very well, with a discussion of \\"Odds Against Tomorrow,\\" a film noir that came out after \\"Touch of Evil,\\" the last \\"official\\" noir.  This leads Hirsch, after a discussion of noir in French cinema, into looking at neo-noir.  Hirsch organizes his material by subgenre or archetype, such as private eye films.<br />My serious problem with the book was that it covers so much, from 1959 to the late 90s.  That is much longer than the original noir era (1941-59).  Thus it seems odd to have films like \\"Shock Corridor\\" and \\"The Long Goodbye\\" discussed with \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Basic Instinct,\\" as if they were part of the same era.  I think Spicer in his new book on film noir treats neo-noir better by splitting it in two (Sixties and Seventies vs. Eighties and Nineties).  <br />However, Hirsch discusses a large number of films in detail and it is always interesting to see what he has to say, even when you disagree.	2002-12-08

However, it could be read with profit by anyone with an interest in the film noir phenomenon.<br />Spicer packs an incredible amount of information in the small space he has.  He refers to the latest books and is incredibly thorough.  He does a fine job on the origins of film noir, covering not only &quot;tough guy&quot; authors and German expressionism, but also Weimar &quot;street films,&quot; French poetic realism and expressionism in American film before noir.<br />What I found especially interesting was the way Spicer continually breaks down noir and neo-noir into different eras.  He sees a difference between noir of the Forties and Fifies, and he distinguishes between early neo-noir and late neo-noir, with Body Heat being the breaking point.  I found that very useful, since the neo-noir era has lasted so long by now.  It is hard to think of The Long Goodbye and Reservoir Dogs as fitting in the same era, so it is good to have a distinguishing framework.<br />Spicer also covers British film noir, and he breaks that down into different eras as well.  To someone very familiar with the American noir cannon, this is like discovering a new continent of films.<br />So I would strongly urge any film noir enthusiast to get Spicer's book.

I devoured it quite rapidly.<br />The book isn't perfect.  Barnes makes some mistakes (I think he means to refer to Fields' \\"That Fatal Glass of Beer\\" and not \\"Face on the Barroom Floor.)  He is also clearly writing for a British audience, since he seems to have no idea how Carole Lombard's death affected the initial American response to the film.<br />However, this are quibbles.  While Barnes' approach to the film is not novel, his is the first examination of the film to delve so deeply into the performance of Sig Rumann as Erhardt, as well as the contributions of Lionel Atwill and the \\"spear carrier\\" who gets to play Hitler.  He pays loving attention to the theatrical details of the movie to such a degree that it will be playing in your mind as you read him.<br />Also, he reprints the numbskull 1942 reviews of the movie, which provide a dark humor of their own.<br />In short, this book is a must for the fans of this film.

It is not really a history of the nation, but more of a history of how the consciousness that there was a people and nation came into existance.  (In other words, he does not go into a lot of detail about cossack revolts and wars and the like, but he shows how these affected the way people thought.)  Wilson does a trememdous job here.<br />The second task of the book is to see what the Ukrainians have made of their independence since 1991.  This is extremely important, since the American media has generally ignored Ukraine since independence and focused solely on Russia.  I had a little trouble following all of Wilson's material here, since I had so little foundation on what has happened in Ukraine recently.  However, Wilson presents his facts clearly, and where possible makes useful comparisons to developments in Russia, Czech Rep., Poland, etc., so I could get a handle on things.<br />In short, this is simply a superb book, one that will take the reader very far in understanding Ukraine and the challenges before it.	2002-11-24

It is an examination of 9 separate topics pertaining to the popular cinema of the 1933-45 era.

W. Griffith and Samuel Goldwyn shortly before Griffith's death.  Staggs sees this as the genesis of \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\"<br />The first half of this book is very interesting.  This part deals with the actual making of the movie and its reception in 1950-1.  However, once the Academy Awards are handed out and Gloria Swanson doesn't win, Staggs loses focus.<br />The idea of seeing how \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" lasted in the public imagination between Wilder's film and Andrew Lloyd Weber's musical sounds interesting, but in Staggs' hands this runs off in too many different directions.  He mentions a ton of movies about Hollywood that bow toward Wilder's film, but he doesn't go into any in much detail.  He goes into a list of porn movies.  He covers SB references on TV.  It never pulls together.<br />Also, it bugged me a little that he is very critical of Wilder's post SB (and post Charles Brackett) films.  He seemed to think this was a new, contrarian position, but, in fact, this was a  commonly held view in the Seventies that Wilder's best films were Double Indemnity, Lost Weekend and Sunset Boulevard.<br />So this book started promisingly but lost its way.	2002-10-22

I liked the author's tone, which was neither worshipful nor condemning.  I thought his examination of the films was pretty interesting.  His idea that Allen really owes more to Fellini than to Bergman sounded pretty convincing to me.<br />Face it, any book on Woody Allen becomes instantly obsolescent, because by the time it gets on the shelves, Allen has made at least one more movie that might move his career in a new direction.<br />I thought this book did a fine job of showing the many changes in Allen's career, from stand-up and TV (stuff that I really wasn't aware of - like Allen subbing for Johnny Carson) to movies and how the movies changed.  Baxter's assessments of the many movies seemed mostly on the mark to me.<br />The definitive work on Woody Allen will only be written after he is dead and thus can no longer make any movies, but until that sad day, I think this book will do very nicely.	2002-10-18

It revealed a lot about him and his career I didn't know.  I disagreed with Sikov on his evaluations of a few films (I like &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; much better than he, but Sikov really seems to hate Gary Cooper) but we agreed on a lot.  (Heck, we even liked the same scenes in &quot;Fedora.&quot;)<br />I gave the book five stars, but I have a few reservations.  My problems came when Sikov went beyond Wilder's career -- or didn't.  His descriptions of politics in Interwar Europe struck me as okay, but superficial.  Okay, this book will be nobody's first choice to learn about such matters, but a little more polish here would have helped.  Then, toward the end of the book, Sikov keeps mentioning that Wilder was out of step with Hollywood.  However, there is really nothing about what the rest of Hollywood was doing, namely how Wilder stacked up against Mel Brooks or Woody Allen in this era.  I would have liked to have seen that issue addressed.<br />However, as a &quot;life&quot; of Wilder and not a study of his &quot;times&quot;, this is a great book.  Fans of Wilder's films will greatly enjoy it.	2002-10-08

Hawks apparently left no papers, and some aspects of his life are undocumented.  (For example, McCarthy keeps mentioning Hawks' great friendship with Gary Cooper, but because of both men being dead and no documentation, Cooper remains a very shadowy presence in this book.  Hawks' friendship with William Faulkner gets far more space, since Faulkner left papers.)<br />So there is not a lot about &quot;the inner Hawks.&quot;  However, there is a lot about Hawks' films.  Once the talkies begin, there is a chapter on practically every film Hawks made.  I was fascinated by the stories behind the films, how long it took some films to get made (Hatari began as an idea for a movie with Cooper), the films Hawks never made (apparently a very traditional vampire film), and his frequent tangles with Howard Hughes.<br />McCarthy did a lot of research, and he does not uncritically accept the stories Hawks told (frequently told) about his work.  So if you like the films of Howard Hawks and are familiar with books such as Hawks on Hawks and Howard Hawks Storyteller, this is a book that you will still get a lot out of.<br />To use a term from Hawks' films:  &quot;This book is good enough.&quot;	2002-09-10

Yes, McBride relies on Sarris and Carey Jr. a good bit of the time, yet this book remains very interesting and does a thorough job covering the many films Ford made.<br />Strengths of the book include an eye-opening look at Ford's WWII service, (How many other guys were at both Midway and D-Day and managed to get to Burma and Yugoslavia as well?) a clear presentation of Ford's relations with the different studios (the list of &quot;better&quot; titles for The Quiet Man the head of Republic tried to force on Ford is hysterically funny) and an evenhanded evaluation of Ford's behavior during the blacklist era.<br />Perhaps the evenhandedness of McBride's tone is what I liked the most about the book.  One could take Ford's life and turn it into a straightforward case of hero-worship, or one could take an axe to him up and down the line, pointing out his failures in family life, his bigoted comments, his questionable actions in some controversial issues.  McBride avoids falling into either extreme camp.  We get Ford warts and all here, and it is left up to us to decide.<br />My only complaint is that the book is too short.  I would have liked more discussion on a few films, and I would have liked a chapter on Ford's posthumous reputation.  McBride raises the issue in his introduction that Ford is being forgotten by the new generation of writers and filmmakers, but he never quite tells why.<br />Still, this was a fine book, one that I read quickly despite its length.	2002-09-09

If you need to understand the essence of Hawks quickly, this is the book to read.  We get Hawks' account of his career, the moguls he dealt with, the stars he liked and disliked, his thoughts about movies after he became inactive.  Todd McCarthy's Howard Hawks The Gray Fox of Hollywood is a more thorough portrait of the man, and it is good to check Hawks' stories against the research in that book, but HAWKS ON HAWKS is still very charming.	2002-09-03

This was probably good, because I found the first couple chapters very choppy and thought they didn't do a good job of setting up the background to the battle in a clear way.<br />HOWEVER, once the siege of the Alamo started, the book improved tremendously.  The account of the battle was very well handled and clear.<br />Still, I think the book's real strength is in what comes after, in dealing with the fate of the battlefield itself in the decades after.  The story of how Walt Disney came to make the Davy Crockett movie is especially well-handled, avoiding both Disney worship and Disney bashing.  The same for their treatment of John Wayne's Alamo movie.  Also, they do a good job revealing how attitudes toward LBJ affected how people thought of the Alamo.<br />All in all, this is a very good book, very interesting even to people who are not that interested in Texas history as such.  If you want to understand post-war American culture, this book is a must.  I just wish the opening chapters had been as well organized as the rest of the book	2002-08-23

If you are a dance enthusiast and want to read a detailed account of their dances, this is NOT the book for you.<br />However, I am not a dance person, but I like classic Hollywood films, and I found this book interesting.  It shows how the Fred&amp;Ginger films share some concerns with screwball comedy, how World War II affected the images of both stars, and how stars age in the public eye.  Gallafent isn't the most graceful of writers, and I got confused in his discussion of &quot;Once Upon a Honeymoon,&quot; but I thought he did a good job connecting the Fred&amp;Giner phenomenon to other developments and careers in classic Hollywood.	2002-08-20

Matheson gives a very compelling look at one week in combat.<br />The novel is short and reads quickly.  This would be a fine assignment in a class that covers World War II.  It would give young readers a vivid picture of life in an infantry squad.<br />Matheson is unsentimental without being bitter.  There are no big speeches on the horrors of war, or the unfairness of it all.  Basically, his characters struggle to survive against the physical dangers and the psychological dangers that combat poses.  <br />Very interesting to read this book now, in light of all the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; talk.  &quot;The Beardless Warriors&quot; gives a very clear picture of what WWII GIs faced, but it is not celebratory in the least.	2002-08-14

There is some repetition, and some of the pieces fail, but on the whole, I enjoyed this book.<br />I enjoyed it because it offered intelligent commentary on movies like &quot;Last of the Mohicans,&quot; &quot;Heat&quot; (with DeNiro and Pacino), &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; &quot;Titanic,&quot; &quot;Hook,&quot; &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; etc.  In other words, movies that I had seen.  I appreciated that someone found something intelligent to say about these films, instead of acting as if the only Nineties movies worth seeing were Iranian.  <br />I look forward to futher Sight and Sound genre volumes, and I wish that Sight and Sound were more available in the USA.	2002-08-12

It is more of a sociological study of Russian filmmakers as a class.  Faraday presents his thesis (over and over) that late Soviet conditions made the filmmakers a privileged class that resented the restrictions placed on it but failed to connect to popular taste in any meaningful way.  Thus when the USSR collapsed, Russian filmmakers were unable to make popular films and became marginalized.<br />This would have made an interesting article, but as a book, it goes on for too long.  Also, it would have been nice if Faraday had actually discussed some of the movies.  The only movie he discusses at any length is &quot;Burnt by the Sun,&quot; which he dislikes as trite in theme and overly pretty.  Overall, this was a disappointment.	2002-08-10

Reading Mellen's book brought back all the things I love about that film.<br />Mellen goes into the origins of the film, into Kurosawa's script and his ideas about history.  She discusses how the different characters represent aspects of the samurai class.  Her analysis of the last scene, where the surviving samurai leave the village, is quite powerful and accurate.<br />If the book has a flaw, it is that Mellen devotes a bit of time to bashing those writers who are critical of &quot;The Seven Samurai.&quot;  If they can't appreciate Kurosawa's film, that is punishment enough.<br />If you enjoy &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; this book will amplify your understanding of that film and thus increase your enjoyment when you watch the movie again.	2002-08-04

It is very well researched, covering films from the silent era to the present.  Not only did Clarens cover the movies, but he also covered the censorship controversies around them, particulary in the mid-Thirties.<br />In short, this is film genre history as it should be:  giving the reader an idea of the breadth of a genre, but focusing on the major films, as well as showing how individual writers and directors could make differences in the genre.<br />Strongly recommended for people interested in the issue of movie violence, &quot;film noir&quot; and how films have changed over time.	2002-08-04

It is very thorough and written in a lively, bright style that is free of academic jargon.<br />Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets.  He pays equal attention to the &quot;high art&quot; films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s, like &quot;Volga-Volga.&quot;)  He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism, World War II, and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.<br />The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT.  Upon reaching the end, the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era.  However, one should be thankful for what one has, and in this volume, one has a truly indispensible book.	2002-08-04

I don't like everything that Capra made (&quot;Platinum Blonde&quot; and &quot;You Can't Take It With You&quot; do nothing for me)but this book proved too much to take.  It reads like a legal brief against Capra by a prosecuting attorney.  Every action Capra undertakes is wrong.  Every success Capra enjoys is really the work of someone else.<br />Shortly after reading &quot;Catastrophe of Success,&quot; I read &quot;Christmas in July&quot; by Diane Jacobs, a biography of Preston Sturges.  It was the difference between night and day.  Jacobs seemed to enjoy her subject, and while she noted Sturges' personal failings, she didn't dwell on them or harp on them.  Instead she focused on the films and why they worked (or didn't).  If only McBride had done the same.	2002-08-04

She touches on key issues such as 1)how it stays close to and deviates from Arthur Bremer's experiences as he tracked George Wallace 2) the interplay between Bernard Herrmann's score and the images 3)how &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; can be seen as borrowing from the horror film 4) how Travis Bickle relates to black people.

Buscombe does a very thorough job, comparing where the film deviates from the novel and the script.  <br />He does something I have seen no other writer on \\"The Searchers\\" do, and that is to discuss the film's music, which is based on the 19th Century song \\"Lorena,\\" which has a theme about separated lovers that reflects the Ethan-Martha relationship.<br />The book concludes with the changing critical reception of \\"The Searchers.\\"  Frankly, I think this is a fine, and fair assessment of the movie, one free from a lot of cant and academic jargon.  I wish Buscombe would write a major book about the Western genre.	2002-08-04

I especially liked his examination of the film's historical context, namely how although it was inspired by WWII issues, it was still relevant when it came out in the early years of the Cold War.  (Christie quotes a Soviet review of the movie which is quite interesting.)<br />This book is strongly recommended for those who love the movies of Powell and Pressburger.	2002-08-04

(When I bought the book, I had thought that the book would include some original reviews and show how attitudes toward &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; had changed over time.)<br />Most of the essays are very good.  The first, on how the script of the movie took shape, is worth the price of the book itself.  Apparently, one can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, or at least we movie lovers were extremely lucky.<br />The only essay that is a dud is the last one, in which the author argues that &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; is not a great film, that it is too romantic, and that &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; is Peckinpah's real masterpiece.  Now, I think PG&amp;BK is a very good movie, but it doesn't hold up as well as &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (and I have seen the restored PG&amp;BK.)  The idea of including an essay attacking the greatness of a movie that is the inspiration for the book strikes me as odd.<br />However, this book is recommended for those with an interest in Westerns and Sam Peckinpah.	2002-08-04

If you only know Ealing Studios for comedies such as &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; and &quot;The Ladykillers,&quot; this book opens up the whole Ealing output from about 1939 to 1957.<br />Not only does Barr discuss the classic Ealing comedies, but he puts them in their context in the studio's output, and he shows how the studio's output changed over time regarding the pressures and changes that British society went through in those pivotal decades.<br />This book is &quot;the rise and fall of Ealing Studios&quot; but in an artistic, not financial, sense.  It gets one to think about what movies say about &quot;national character&quot; yet remains enjoyable and jargon-free.	2002-08-04

It is packed with information and is extremely useful in giving the reader a view of the American film industry in the heyday of the silent era.<br />One can read not only about popular genres and movie stars, but about how the studios came into existance (and Koszarski presents this in a clear, understandable way), and how movies were shown to the public, including the legendary &quot;dream palace&quot; movie theaters.<br />I am left breathless by this book.  Was there an aspect of movies in the 1920s that Koszarski overlooked?  If so, it must be unimportant.  He mastered an incredible amount of information and presented it very clearly and concisely here.  Highly recommended to all interested in the American film industry.	2002-08-04

He does a very thorough job, covering things like political implications, the musical score, the compensation of the cast, and the role of \\"Stagecoach\\" in the revival of the Western at the end of the Thirties.

I enjoyed his style and then started reading his books on Broadway Musicals.<br />I am not an expert on musicals by any stretch of the imagination.  However, I found &quot;Open a New Window&quot; very readable and interesting.  I was continually surprised to find people in musicals that I never would have imagined.  (Vincent Price starring in a Broadway musical in 1968?  My universe is still reeling.)  To someone who knows &quot;Funny Girl&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot; as films, it was revealing and useful to read about the plays they started as.<br />As for complaints that Mordden overlooks the big picture in the development of the musical, I would disagree.  Granted, I am no expert, but to me he kept referring to the social changes going on and kept emphasizing how the subject matter of musicals kept becoming darker.  <br />&quot;Open a New Window&quot; isn't a heavy, scholarly tome, but it is fun and accessible to readers who are curious about Broadway musicals while not obsessed with the subject.	2002-07-26

I can't think of another book that deals with the films of this era so completely.  It is the book to turn to when one has finished Peter Kenez's history of Soviet Cinema to 1953.<br />What makes the book so interesting is that the author has investigated the background to each film, such as the controversy that projects such as &quot;Carnival Night,&quot; &quot;Nine Days of One Year&quot; and &quot;Ilich's Gate/I Am Twenty&quot; generated before and during filming.  These critical responses are tied to the political shifts of the Khrushchev era.<br />If there are any drawbacks, it is that the book opens slow, but then the interesting films didn't really start appearing until 1956.  Also, the Shakespeare films of Soviet directors aren't really covered, but I can understand why the author made that choice.<br />Still, the positive features far outweigh any criticism.  The book gives new perspective on directors such as Mikhail Romm, and shows the start of the careers of directors such as Eldar Riazonov and Elim Klimov.  It adds flesh and spirit to the overviews of &quot;Thaw&quot; era Soviet cinema that appeared in The Most Important Art and other books.<br />Strongly recommended to anyone with an interest in Soviet cinema in general or European film of the Fifties and Sixties.	2002-06-17

Sad to say, this volume is a disappointment.<br />Yes, there is some good information here, but the author's style is extremely dry, and I found her footnoting style to be very misleading.  (She mentioned one film that exists only in fragments in a Soviet film archive in Moscow, and her footnote lists only the original review of the movie in 1914, before there even was a Soviet film archive.)  She pursues the topic of the origin of the closeup to death, devoting one whole chapter to whether the camera was 12 feet from the actors or only 9 feet.<br />Admittedly, the era of the \\"Patent wars\\" is confusing, but I think more could have been done to make this era clearer to readers.  This is a very weak volume in an extremely good series of books on the American cinema.	2002-02-05

Russia.  Alexander covers the court intrigues, the attempts at reform, the complexities of foreign policy.  He also avoids treating Catherine's personal life in a sensationalistic way.<br />So if you read this book, you will learn a lot.  On the other hand, the book doesn't really come to life in the way Massie's &quot;Peter the Great&quot; or Avrich's &quot;Russian Rebels&quot; did.  It is recommended only to those with a serious interest in the time of Catherine, such as students, and not the casual reader.	2001-12-03

The authors trace how the film was made, covering things such as Stevens' annotated copy of the novel, possible casting choices (William Holden as the father!), conditions of filming in Wyoming, scenes cut from the movie (a romantic subplot for Ben Johnson's character), and how the movie was received.<br />&quot;Shane&quot; tends to polarize fans of the Western.  There are those who deeply admire it and those who find it too self-conscious.  I fall into the first camp, but I think that anyone interested in the Western genre should find something of interest in this book.	2001-11-30

However, I got this book as a gift and found it quite interesting.<br />What makes this book special is not so much Radzinsky's account of Nicholas' last days but his access to Communist archives that let him reconstruct how and why the Bolshevik leadership decided on killing Nicholas as they did.  (Apparently this was done to thwart Trotsky, who wanted a public trial of Nicholas with himself as prosecutor.)<br />Also fascinating is Radzinsky's account of the subsequent careers of Nicholas' murderers, how they became minor league Communist celebrities, telling Komsomol (youth group) assemblies how they had shot the Tsar.  This went on until Stalin decided they had become drunken embarassments and kept them out of the public eye.<br />So I would say if you want a book that looks at the last days of Nicholas from a broader perspective, this is the book to get.	2001-11-29

These &quot;rubble films&quot; dealt with how the defeated Germans were to come to grips with the Nazi past.  Shandley examines about ten films in close detail.<br />I found this a very useful book, because this era of German filmmaking is so little covered in English.  Usually most histories skip from 1933 to 1968.  While the Nazi Cinema and East German cinema have gotten a little more attention in the last decade, the &quot;rubble film&quot; era remains overlooked.<br />Shandley organizes his book around themes (treatment of Jews, those films set in the Third Reich, relationship between the sexes).  I would have preferred a chronological approach.  Also, he constantly compares these films to Italian Neorealism, and I would have liked some comparison to Soviet-bloc films of this same era.  But apart from these objections, Shandley succeeds in the major task I ask of any book on film:  that it creates a desire to see the movies in question.  He has opened a useful window into a forgotten room of German film history.	2001-11-29

This is a terrific book on what is probably the best American musical film.  Wollen captured me when he compared Kelly's solo dance in &quot;Rain&quot; to a dance in &quot;Cover Girl,&quot; something I had long thought, but had never seen anyone mention in print.<br />Wollen does a fine job showing how the movie fits into Gene Kelly's career and the development of the movie musical.  He also has some eye-opening stuff on how &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; nearly ran afoul of the Hollywood blacklist.<br />Even if you've seen the movie many times, you'll probably learn something about it in Wollen's book that you didn't know before.  I did.	2001-11-29

A number of topics are covered, such as Ford's use of music, the relationship between Ford and Frederick Remington's image of the West, the way Ford depicts different ethnic groups in his films.<br />By and large, the authors are sympathetic to John Ford (a good thing in my mind) and they clearly appreciate the movies.  I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 since there is some repetition among the different authors.  (For example, everyone is compelled to discuss the last scene of &quot;Fort Apache.&quot;)  Still, it is a pleasure to read a jargon-free academic book on Ford's Westerns.	2001-11-19

Also, the comments on the individual films are interesting and can point the reader in the direction of some films he might not otherwise have heard of.<br />The book concludes with several &quot;ten best Western&quot; lists from different film critics.  Overall, a useful book for anyone interested in this genre.	2001-11-15

The new book is as thoughtful and well-written as the previous book.  My only complaint is that &quot;Movie Love&quot; is not chronologically organized.<br />Harvey sets up an opposition between traditional Hollywood cinema and the &quot;new realism&quot; of the Fifties.  He comes down in favor of the traditional filmmaking of Douglas Sirk, Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Siodmak, as opposed to the emotionalism of, say, &quot;East of Eden&quot; or other movies influenced by &quot;Method&quot; actors.<br />Reading &quot;Movie Love in the Fifties&quot; is like listening to a wonderfully informed person talk about the movies he is enthusiastic about.  Harvey's style is free of academic jargon, and he makes you remember that people went to movies because they were fun.  I found myself dying to see &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; again after reading this book, and Harvey has persuaded me that I've got to track down and see &quot;Christmas Holiday,&quot; &quot;Lured,&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; now.	2001-11-15

It starts when a new management team takes over United Artists.  They have to put together a slate of films.  &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; is one of their choices, and we see how this film moves from one choice among many to the behemoth that wrecks the studio.  Contrary to some of the reviewers who say the book doesn't get to &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; soon enough, I think the book is well-structured.<br />I also like the way Bach displays three different directors:  Cimino, Scorsese and Woody Allen.  Cimino is obviously the egomaniac out of control.  Allen comes across as the &quot;good director,&quot; always conscious that he is working with somebody else's money.  Scorsese comes out between the two extremes.<br />Hey, if this book were only about &quot;Heaven's Gate,&quot; I wouldn't like it so much, but we also get some insight into &quot;Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; two much better movies.	2001-07-07

Not only is there Chekhov's fine story about a lost dog getting involved in a circus act, but the illustrations are wonderful.  Surely this is the way 19th Century St. Petersburg looked!<br />My daughter first found this book in the library when she was six, and it quickly became one of her favorites.	2001-06-24

Initially I thought the West Side guy &amp; East Side gal plot would turn out to be a dopey &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; take-off, but the author had far better control of his material than that.  &quot;Crooked River Burning&quot; isn't a love story but a slice of history that we see through the lives of two people.  This book tells how the post-WWII hopes and good feelings of Cleveland gradually darkened and decayed until they crashed and burned with the Glenville riots of 1968.  But we see this expressed through the lives of David and Anne, not through some recitation of statistics.<br />In many ways, I think this book does a better job at showing the passage of time than Michael Chabon's &quot;Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.&quot;  To me, the heart of Chabon's book was the 1940-1 material.  The chapters on 1945 and 1953, while nice, didn't add anything necessary.  &quot;Crooked River Burning,&quot; however, moves from the 1940s to the end of the Sixties, and it all holds together.  For instance, the baseball game where David sees Satchel Paige pitch in 1948 picks up special resonance in the mid-60s for David and plays a part in the unravelling of his marriage.  Very good plotting.<br />As for the footnotes, these were mostly in special chapters on real Cleveland figures, and didn't bother me at all.  Chabon had footnotes in &quot;Kavalier and Clay&quot; as well.<br />A good novel about the recent past in a city usually overlooked.	2001-06-24
US	47909962	R3D7VYMNLGNL4L	1581120818	978019005	The File on Robert Siodmak in Hollywood: 1941-1951	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Master of Film Noir	This is a dissertation published as a book.  It should be of interest to readers interested in film noir, as it has very detailed discussions of &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946) and &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949) as well as Siodmak's other Hollywood films noir.<br />The book only examines Siodmak's films.  The title, a play on &quot;The File on Thelma Jordan,&quot; the last of Siodmak's American films noir, sets up false expectations that the book will deal with Siodmak's private life, perhaps politics in that era of WWII and HUAC, but this is not the case.  Still, the films get wonderful coverage, and this book should fight the tendency in recent years to overlook Siodmak's contribution to film noir.	2000-12-31
