His intellect was unmatched, and his loyalty to America was honorable.  Thomas Jefferson on the other hand was the opposite.  This president condoned slander against General Hamilton even when he knew it to be untrue.  George Washington never wavered in his respect for Hamilton and many people admired the 1st president.  The amount of fighting among the founders and members of Congress was astounding in its bitterness.  What I learned most from this book was that Alexander Hamilton was the 2nd greatest American (Mr. Washington being the first) and that Thomas Jefferson was a terrible judge of character, he was a slick, vindictive man who chose to hide in the woods rather than defend America in the war.  A spineless act, that.	2004-09-02

Lachlann and Eva could have been very interesting, and the overall plot wasn't too bad, but for heaven's sake, I want dialogue between a hero and heroine that tells a story, not a line or two thrown in just to remind us that there ARE characters in this book, while the author relates page after page ...after page, of smithy work.

Adrian was such a great guy, so smart, exceptionally handsome, loyal, gentle to those he loved, and tough to his enemies.  <BR>Sophia's friends, Attila and Jacques very nearly stole the show, though!  These two were hilarious, especially when they showed up in the park.  <BR>Adrian's older brother, Colin, (the oldest we never did meet) was a wonderful man, yet I did wonder why there was no explanation about Colin's feelings concerning Adrian's birth.  Colin accepted Adrian, which was fantastic, but what led to this great friendship?<BR>Also, I'm sorry to say that I found one scene in this book totally boring and I didn't like the distraction.  It was when Sophia visited her ancestral home to fight the ghosts of her past.  Her relationship with Adrian was progressing nicely, then all of sudden Sophia leaves and the action just stopped!  I would never discount the severity of her tragic past, but we learned nothing new by her going there.  Her supposed conversation with her deceased father was boring, and not the least informative.	2004-04-09

And Bianca was witty, lovely and smart, not to mention talented.  But several things bothered me about this book.<br />*What was so all-fired wrong with being an opera singer?  To have one of the best talents in the world?  Leave it to the English (of that era) to find something sordid about it. <BR>*Vergil said he'd settle for being Bianca's lover if she wanted to pursue her career. Why? Couldn't he just as easily have married her?  After all, he claimed not to care what others thought.<BR>*I didn't care for Vergil's *rules* regarding his relationship with Bianca.  &quot;...That you will give yourself to me when I want, how I want.&quot;  Puh-leeze!  Somebody should have smacked that guy!<BR>*After more than 230 pages, didn't Vergil even wonder how Bianca felt about him?  Up til then, she never said how she felt about him.  We, the readers, didn't have a clue either.<BR>*Why did Bianca have to write her letter to Vergil in code?  That made absolutely no sense.  It caused him undo heartache, and delayed him getting to her.<BR>*The ending was weak.  And Nigel's actions were far too serious for Bianca to have let it go.  And if it would have been any other hero (a tougher man like Daniel St. John or Adrian Burchard), Nigel would have paid dearly for what he did. But Vergil's problem was that he was too laid back, not tough enough.  <BR>*The four stars is due to the addition of the other male heros included in this story.  It's important to read all books in the same series.	2004-04-06

I still consider this book a rare classic, but after reading it again for the first time in more than 20 years, I see what other readers who were disturbed by this book saw.  No excuse in the world made it all right for Brandon to rape an innocent girl.  He was supposed to be intelligent, so no, I can no longer buy the fact that he mistook a protesting girl for a prostitute.  The author then had Brandon rape Heather again, and by making him talk gently to her, it was supposed to have been all right.  It wasn't.  Ugh!  But, like so many others, I was totally pulled into this premise.  And although I came away with the feeling that Brandon &amp; Heather fell in love the first time I read this book, I really didn't get that feeling this time.  I had to ask myself, how did they fall in love?  Neither one had any outstanding personality traits to form an attraction, with the exception of their good looks.  I also used to think that a 35 year old man and an 18 year old girl was fine for the era, but I realize now it was not.  I wonder now why KW made him so old?	2004-03-13

Hmmmm....<BR>Kianna, (isn't that a beautiful name?)while a bit too naive, truly loved Jason so I can ignore that about her.  When pressured to save her husband's life at the hands of that bad fellow Dale, it was clear she would have done anything for Jason.  Meanwhile, Jason, if not for being overly stubborn, could have avoided his own distress, as well as Kianna's.  This story never had a dull moment.  Jason's brother Jeremy and sister-in-law Sydney were absolutely fantastic.  And Jason's ex-mistress Arlene Turner was a devious little thing.

I can understand why Lucas loved/hated Emma, but to leave the entire country? For seven years?  A bit extreme to me.  Lucas didn't know he was wrong about Emma simply because he refused to ever speak to her again.  Which was unfortunate.  Just goes to show that unforgiveness isn't always the wisest course of action. In truth, Emma was a brave, selfless, honorable woman, not to mention very beautiful.  The story was interesting all the way through, but a couple of things bothered me.  First, Lucas almost came across as a \\"mama's boy.\\" Then, when he found out who had attacked Emma, in his thoughts he displayed compassion, understanding, outrage on her behalf, and remorse and guilt for all that he'd put her through.  Then he blew it when he said to himself,    \\"____ had had her first.\\"  How appalling.	2004-03-04

I'd first read about Morvan and Anna in LORD OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS and I realize I should have left it at that.  Anna was wonderful in both books, but now that I've read THE PROTCTOR I realize Morvan wasn't the man I thought him to be at all.  Sure, he was arrogant, but I had no idea how demeaning he could be.  I don't see how Anna could love a man who crushed the very life right out of her heart. He also trampled her pride and made her act submissive in front of her people in order to prove that he had complete power over her because he was THE MAN. He took all that belonged to her - her home, her lands, her income, and her horses.  He had nothing.  No sooner had she married him, Anna had to start sneaking around to do the things she enjoyed, and she had to wear clothes she disliked because HE told her to wear them.  When it came time for her to devise an escape plan for Morvan, a weaker woman would have no longer had the confidence in herself to prevail.  And since I know Anna wears men's trousers in LORD OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS, Morvan's awful treatment of Anna was all for nothing anyway. I would have found it hard to forgive his ill treatment.  I also didn't like when Morvan referred to his sweet sister, Christiana, as &quot;unbearably stupid.&quot; (She was naive about men.)<br />There were two redeeming factors to this book:<br />The brief scenes with Ian were delightful, and that gorgeous knight Ascanio was a wonderful friend to Anna. Too bad he was a priest.	2004-03-03

This is one of those rare romances wherein the reader must pay attention to understand what's going on.  How refreshing!  David is the most unusual of heros; fascinating, mysterious, handsome as all get out, and of course, wealthy.  However, I had read Lord of A Thousand Nights first, and that was where I became intrigued with David (and his brother-in-law, Morvan).  But for the life of me, I couldn't equate that David with the David in this book.  I don't know, he just seemed like a different man.  I didn't see it as a detraction, he was just different.  The same was true with the lovely Christiana.  While reading this book, I had to keep reminding myself that she was the same young woman who befriended Reyna in Lord of A Thousand Nights.  No matter, though, this book was absolutely fantastic.	2004-02-24

Uncanny talent.<BR>I was glad that Lee 'looked' her age, rather than have people say but-you-look-thirty-five.  I found it completely believable that Chris could love her.  What I didn't find believable was the fact that Chris hadn't dated a girl in 2 years prior to dating Lee!  It just wasn't plausible that a single, handsome young man never dated.

This type of woman simply didn't fit the story, not when a toddler is involved.  As such, the story should have been more romantic, sweet, if you will, to match the innocence of Gil's young daughter, not contradict it.  Gil's lust for Anabel came from the gutter, without one iota of respect for her; therefore it was hard to believe he could fall in love with her.  <BR>Denison's story wasn't much better.  It too was very dull.  Chayse dogged Adrian into the ground with her request for him to pose for her calender!!!  Any other man would have called her a stalker, but Adrian didn't seem offended in the least.  I can only believe that Adrian didn't really mean 'no' all those times he declined her offer.  Once we discovered why Adrian kept backing off, the story was pretty much done for.  And it was a lame reason anyway!  Good God, one would think he'd been maimed in battle the way he kept vehemently denying Chayse's request!

My husband and I are longtime fans of the Giants and of LT.  In fact, I read Mr. Taylor's first book.  The writing style of this book was perfect.  It couldn't have been written (or edited) any other way.  For me, his troubling times, of which there were many, didn't bring disgust but rather sympathy and compassion.  However, the way he treated his ex-wife was appalling.  There is no sympathy from me for his lack of respect for his marriage vows.  He spoke so highly of her, she (and their children) did not deserve to be humiliated in such a public manner.  I know that its really none of my business but I'm glad they are on very friendly terms.

I was glad the author didn't try to make Ariel a \\"mature-for-her-age\\" type woman.

US	36780283	R1R2K4LXOEOA2P	0758204434	399804889	Almost A Gentleman	Books	2	7	11	N	N	Just too boring...(Sorry)	This book started out well enough, but I had to force myself to finish it.  However, I really liked David.  I had no problem with David finding himself attracted to Mr. Marston, perhaps because subconsciously I knew Marston's true identity.  But David didn't, and we're reminded that no one can prevent how one feels about someone else.  David was certainly troubled by this, yet in a light-hearted manner, never undignified.  I thought it was a great!  The author did this well.<BR>I was disappointed by the way in which David learned Mr. Marston was a woman, though.  After all the anticipation and all those pages, it turned out to be a very dull scene.<BR>And there was so much useless detail throughout the book, and at the worst possible times.  For example:  We believe Phoebe and David are about to kiss, then all of a sudden the author decides to describe the doors Phoebe just closed behind her, with their French style from a preceding century, and how they are adorned with gaily colored fruit and flowers, blah blah blah, and then tries to incorporate the doors into the scene by comparing Phoebe's EYES to said doors.  Never heard that comparison before. <BR>So, with the exception of David's well-written character, this one falls flat to me.	2004-01-01

I absolutely loved this book.  You can't get better than Chieftain Royce Campbell as a hero!  Every line he uttered was manly, perfect, never whiny, and was in fact, quite perfect.  He was also VERY handsome, and very intelligent.  I thought the story moved along just fine; a sweet love story.  It takes good writing to keep lengthy scenes going, as this author did when Brianna and Royce remained in the cabin so long.  <BR>But no book is perfect:  I thought Brianna was a little immature.  Take the giggles, for example.  She also kept saying, \\"It's my decision,\\" like a petulant child.  Royce and her brother Ian led her to believe she'd made her own \\"decision\\" many times, when in fact they had merely placated her.  That's the way I saw it, anyway.<BR>This book left a lasting impression on me.  I loved it.	2003-12-31

I greatly anticipated this book, but it was nearly identical to Topping From Below, yet boring, if that makes any sense.  (I hate to think L.R. lacks real imagination!)<BR>James and Carly were almost identical in personality to Michael and Nora.  I also thought the end result of the plot very lame.  There were so many wonderful ways the author could have solved the mystery of Carly's attack that would have been a lot more interesting than what she gave us.  <BR>This novel was no match for the first one. I was totally disappointed.	2003-12-20

He was absolutely perfect!  Handsome and smart, and not a wimpy bone in his beautiful body.<BR>However, I really got sick of the author referring to Ramiel as the Bastard Shiekh on nearly every page.  I kid you not!<BR>Nor did I care for Muhamed.  I didn't like him in Fascinated, which I'd read before this book, and I liked him even less here.

This guy Courtland was just about the meanest character ever made, and he was the hero!  He rarely said anything civil to Drue, he just growled.

It held my interest throughout.  <BR>I do wish Charles' friendship with Damon had developed better, however.  <BR>Elaine was better off in the 19th century, it seemed, as her present day life was going nowhere.  But I do not believe she knew nothing of French kissing.  Married 17 years to a prude still doesn't make it believable, and she must have had a boyfriend or two before that.<BR>I found Charles' eventual acceptance of Elaine's true identity believable simply because he witnessed Morrigan's power.<BR>I do think the author took the easy way out at the end there...when Charles was in conversation with Elaine/Morrigan, all of a sudden he never called her by name.  I was curious as to how he would address her. <BR>Overall, though, I really liked this book a lot!  Charles was very handsome and appealing, and I thought his inebriated scene with Damon cute.	2003-11-17

EVERYone wore leather, too.  <BR>Mostly, it made no sense that these Dark-Hunter's would kill to protect humans when they seemed to want to kill each other instead.  There was a real and ugly hatred between these guys.  They could viciously kill anyone and feel no guilt, so it just wasn't believable that they would care one way or the other about the safety of complete strangers.	2003-10-28

For example, Blue's denied service in a small town restaurant in front of all the patrons, all of whom believe he's a killer.  He's then denied hospitality at the local motel, for the same reason.  THEN, he's surrounded by a handful of thugs ready to beat the stuffing out of him.  This prejudice stems from old memories of Blue's childhood.  His stepfather never wanted him, even though Blue loved him, therefore something MUST have been wrong with Blue.  No one seems the least impressed by Blue's successful and heroic career as a respected Navy SEAL.  In my experience, this kind of show of attitude simply would not happen.	2003-10-26

Francis was great, a perfect hero in looks, manner, loyalty, and intelligence.  The author succeeded in making Francis a romantic hero without ever GIVING the reader a romantic scene.  How's that for talent?<br />My only complaint was with Richard.  He treated Kate very unkindly in her own home, with her husband nearby, yet no one came to her defense, no one said a word.

In this, she is unbeatable.  No one else gives as much depth to fictional characters. <BR>I do wish Jace and Julia's love life would have been a little more detailed, however.<BR>And (the reason for 4 stars), I wish KS wouldn't make those characters recovering from illness or accident SO sickly looking.

I don't understand how KW can write such classic material in most of her previous novels, then ruin the book by droning on and on with boring dialoge and settings.

However, I found it difficult to believe that Nick fell in love with Lucky that quickly and sincerely, as he barely knew her when he claimed he felt this way.  Also, I think Lucky stepped WAY over the line in her treatment of Nick's father, Paul.  And finally, how could Nick have walked away from that little girl he met so easily?  His first instinct should have been to take her with him.  I'm sure the girl's grandfather wouldn't have cared, especially if Nick would have thrown a few bucks his way.  This child also had siblings!  Shouldn't Nick have at least contacted Social Services?  I honestly had trouble concentrating on the rest of the book because I couldn't stop thinking about that little girl.  And one more thing...(sorry)... Nick cried too much!	2003-09-14

I thought Tucker and Caroline were great, very realistic and fun to read about.  I liked Caroline's frustration with Tucker on those occasions when she thought he was just a lazy guy with no brain.  <BR>I wasn't thrilled with the actual killer, as it didn't seem plausible.

I liked Nick in Sophia's Lover very much and I couldn't wait to read his own story.  I was a little disappointed, however.  The author kept Nick's personality intact, and his genuine warmth, yet his love scenes with Charlotte were rather cold.  In fact, most of LK's books have this problem.  It's not the least bit romantic.  Nick was mysterious, handsome, and yes, troubled.  He deserved much happiness.	2003-09-09

For instance, when Frank meets Jake... \\"within minutes\\" Frank likes and wants to protect and support Jake for the rest of his life.  Why?  I don't think anyone would make that kind of committment that quickly to a total stranger.  It wasn't believable.  <BR>I didn't like Carrie's opinion of the Vietnam War, but I accepted it because she was young and uninformed of actual events.  The price of freedom is visible in our graveyards, but many will never understand that.<BR>Megan suffers through an \\"incident\\" later in the story, and Jake, while there for her, had a lot of nerve getting mad at Megan because she'd hurt his feelings.  After what she'd been through, Megan's feelings should have been considered. Neither Jake nor Ian seemed outraged over what happened to Megan.<BR>We were led to believe that the relationship between Stephen and Megan was solid and could withstand anything.  These two supposedly told each other everything, yet Megan went through an elaborate escapede that changed other peoples' lives to keep something very important from Stephen based on something she thought he'd said.  Why didn't she simply ask him?  They asked each other everything else.  Didn't ring true at all.<BR>And why did Jake start talking like a doctor?  He was far too clinical in his analysis of his friend.<BR>Other than that, this story and the characters were great.	2003-09-01

Never have I been on the &quot;edge of my seat&quot; before, wondering (and dreading) who the killer might be, not literally.  And although some books have affected me emotionally, no book has ever brought tears to my eyes as did this novel.  This happened while reading about the childhood of the twins, Charles and Jason Sinclair.  <BR>Between wondering who the killer was and weeping over the twins childhood, I was an emotional wreck!!  This due to the enormous talent of Katherine Stone.  (I know, some of her newer books weren't that great.)  But this one had it all; brotherly and sisterly love, romance, heartache, and mystery.  The love stories were absolutely wonderful; the love scenes went into a little more detail here than in some of KS's later books.<BR>This book also shows how basic misunderstandings, assumptions, and noncommunication can alter the lives of people, sometimes drastically.<BR>Usually when I finish a novel I immediately start another, but the characters in TWINS left such a lasting impression, I found I simply couldn't concentrate on ANYTHING for quite some time.	2003-08-25

Couldn't the author have used a black rose or something?<BR>Much ado is made about Jane's ability to handle a gun, which she carries with her mostly all the time. But good grief, no wonder men (in those days and probably today) laughed at a woman with a gun. The author led us to believe Jane was practically expert, yet the opposite seemed true. For instance, Jane is accosted in the street, she mentions to herself that her gun is in her reticule, but within seconds the reticule is on the ground and she's off and running.<BR>Another time she's in the company of a few men who give her the creeps. One man asks her to hand over her reticule with the gun inside before she enters a room to speak to their boss. Jane does so without hesitating, then of course, regrets doing so. On another occasion, when she finally does shoot the thing, she misses her target. And her timing was off. Someone else had also fired a shot. Fittingly, Jane is then tackled to the floor. <BR>This might seem trivial, but I don't like it when a heroine is supposed to be good at something normally reserved for men, then it isn't followed through.<BR>It throws the whole story off balance.	2003-08-01

Rather than let the reader accept these people for who they were, with all their quirks, the author must have thought she needed to push the envelope and make them weird so we'd notice them.  It wasn't necessary; they were fine as they were.<br />I especially didn't like how Davy's friend showed up at the door as an elegant, classy and even mysterious man, only to land in the sack with Tilda's sister literally within seconds of meeting her.  He ended up being just another base character without intrigue.	2003-07-01

Nothing wrong with a guy cooking dinner, but for some reason, the scene with Eric making the cornish hens for dinner with Nancy didn't sit well.

Perry, her love, was the same.  In fact, these two nearly stole the show!<BR>This book lacks one star because of the bland relationship between Thea and her aunt, Victoria.  They were virtual strangers and had only an I-love-you-because-you're-my-relative relationship, because they certainly didn't know each other, didn't know anything about each other.

The Quinn family was so wonderful and endearing I actually felt like I was at the birthday party and the musical! The plot was great and held my attention throughout the whole book.  Each character's actions seemed true to form, and very realistic.  I thought it very funny when Audie dragged a reluctant Griffin to hear the Quinn family play.  In fact, there were lots of funny moments, with very witty dialogue.<BR>The love scenes were a bit more graphic than I'm used to reading about, but certainly not offensive.  I guess my only problem with this book (and it's minor) is Stacey's language when intimate with Audie.  He kind of degraded 'the act', in my opinion.	2003-04-25

It started out great, but I quickly came to dislike this duke, Bradford. Caroline shined at first, but that didn't last long once she took up with Bradford. JG's heros are always a little arrogant in an endearing way, but this guy was very domineering and quite the cad. <BR>He kept saying he takes what he wants, including women.  I can only conclude that he would have [molested] Caroline if she weren't willing.  <BR>The moment he decided he'd be the only man to court Caroline, he began to tell her what to do, and not very nicely either.  At one point he told her he'd beat her if she didn't obey him! Caroline said not a word! <BR>JG has had her heros say this before but it was always taken as a joke, or had been said in a light-hearted manner.<BR>Here we had a spirited, smart, and talented woman in Caroline, and the author turned her into a wimp by pairing her with this overbearing ogre.

We had to read over and over how short the guy was as if it were a fault; (i.e. his thigh was shorter than Winn's boyfriend's thigh.)<BR>Joseph was described as having curly hair in such a way that it wasn't normally an attractive trait in a man, but it would do here. Authors are supposed to endear heros to us, not make them yucky! Speaking of yucky: Winn and Joseph had just finished a game of racket ball at her club, had showered and met outside the locker room, and she noticed that he \\"held a wad of something cotton and white - his underwear.\\" To which Joseph explained he'd left in a hurry and hadn't thought about clean underwear! Now I ask you, did we really want to know that? How gross!<br />Joseph was terribly overbearing. Winn really didn't know him when he literally pressed his nose to her neck while she applied lipstick! And later on in the story when Winn had asked Joseph to give her time alone, he kept calling and calling and calling, leaving extremely sappy love messages and - groveling, if you will. <BR>And no guy would use the phrase \\"where the blazes\\" or \\"what the blazes\\" ... even in 1984. He was also no dancer, yet he was supposed to have \\"held his own\\" on the dance floor, moving his shoulders, hips, and feet.  In real life, he'd look like an idiot.<BR>When Winn made a spontaneous visit to see Joseph, she met his brothers and parents and they fawned over her as if she were Joseph's longtime girlfriend, when in fact, at this point, she'd probably spoken more words to her mailman than she had to Joseph.  I don't think a guy should play games, using the 'hard to get', motto, but this guy was too much of a sap.  I don't see how a woman could end up falling for a guy who, minutes after meeting him, has set you a place in his family. I find guys like Joseph a turn-off.  He was the most uncool guy ever.	2003-03-11

There aren't many books by NR that I don't like, as she is so talented and writes on a variety of informed topics, i.e. ballet, horse racing, Irish history, among just a few. <BR>But this one wasn't rich in its story and the characters failed to ring true, especially to their professions.  For instance, I never could accept Brian in the role of lead singer for a band, he just didn't fit this profile at all.  And I wanted to feel his music, his singing, but that never happened.  We readers should have felt the music as if we were in the audience, or at least off stage. <BR>In most of NR's books, the reader truly comes to know the characters, but not so in this one.

This was a gripping novel, one I didn't want to put down, as the characters were so realistic. But there were so many problems: <BR>-If Clay and Catherine had been any younger I doubt I'd have read this book. I have no interest in teenage love. <BR>-I commended Catherine's values at first, but then it became frustrating. It was so obvious she and Clay were beginning to care deeply for each other, yet Catherine continued to reject him, and not just in the bedroom. <br />-Then I worried these two weren't compatible at all because there were so many awkward silences between them; they could scarcely think of a thing to say to each other, and often it was forced.<BR>-And Clay, this nice, handsome guy, was so emotionally tortured it hardly seemed fair. I'm glad he had to eventually work things out with Jill; otherwise we would have been left wondering about the past love between these two.<BR>-Clay's parents and grandparents were great. I didn't like to see them hurt. Although I don't think Catherine purposely kept them from seeing the baby, she should have offered them a chance to see their grandchild on a regular basis.<BR>-Like his parents, Clay was a very affectionate person and it seemed out of character for him not to have held his own newborn baby.<BR>-Catherine's mother, Ada, was a pitiful case. I know she was afraid of Herb, but I despised how weak she was. Short of shooting the creep, which he deserved, she should have put her childrens' welfare first rather than neglect them just to keep the peace with her idiot husband.  Although she lived in the same house with her kids, for the most part she ignored them throughout their entire lives, and certainly never offered them a hug. What a disgrace!<br />-I was appalled the author had Catherine drink at the wedding, and very heavily too, when just a month or so before she was drinking orange juice!<BR>-I was shocked when the author didn't have the baby placed in a car seat.  Come on, this book was written in 1985!!!My child was born in 1983 and he was in a car seat! It was the law!!!<BR>-And finally, what exactly was Catherine going to college FOR? I was never sure what she studied.<BR>Anyway, believe it or not, I loved this book, despite the heartache to so many people. This book was so realistic that, in the end, even though happiness prevailed, you hated the heartaches that had attached itself to so many nice people.	2003-03-05

Although not applicable here, nearly half of all women would do what Julie did out of revenge, the other half (like Julie) out of some misguided belief that she's \\"helping\\" the man she loves. Good grief, no wonder men don't trust women! It's a no-win situation for these guys.  Zack expected complete trust and faith from the woman he loved and it was Julie's absolute duty to give it to him.

I reread ONCE A PRINCESS after reading this, and I got a better understanding of Vasili. I found him to be very endearing, whereas the first time I read about him, I thought he was too arrogant.  He's not, actually.  Too handsome for his own good, it kind of works against him where women are concerned.  All of his relationships to date have been superficial - until he meets the lovely and spirited Alexandra.<br />Since she has no interest in marriage, she displays terrible table manners, etc., hoping Vasili will end a betrothal neither wants.  But I think Vasili was smitten the moment he began to call her \\"Alex\\", her preferred name, whether he realized it or not.<br />Vasili was a true standout, a great man, and a wonderful match for Alex.  And, as I remember from ONCE A PRINCESS, his loyalty to his friends, especially Stefan, was unquestionable.<br />I liked the way Vasili seemed to momentarily stand aside while Alex threatened - in an understanding way - other women interested in him. A losing battle, that, since Vasili was so handsome.  There were no men, or women for that matter, as perfect and beautiful as Vasili. Alex eventually understood this and realized she couldn't spend the rest of her life worrying about it.<br />It was a joy to read more about King Stefan, although Tanya could have been in it more.	2003-02-11

Pierce and his sister Val were in fact quite interesting in the beginning, but all of a sudden, the story turned very boring. <BR>And, as with nearly all KS's books, we're introduced to secondary characters (couples), but in this book, none were very interesting, none worth getting to know.<BR>Pierce was handsome enough, smart enough, and was even fairly witty, but he finds himself in love with Ana after an extremely brief acquaintance. A very typical pattern for KS's main characters; two strangers spend an hour in 'deep' conversation, and suddenly the GUY is in love with the GIRL, rarely the other way around. This tends to make her heros kind of wimpy, wearing their hearts on their sleeves.  The guys in KS's books fall in love so ridiculously fast and fawn so stupidly, they practically grovel emotionally at the girls' feet. I find it foolish and not very attractive. Though not true in this case, a good story-line usually keeps these characters somewhat interesting.	2003-01-28

(The men usually fall in love too early in KS's stories, i.e. \\"Happy Endings.\\")<BR>Her characters, especially the males, do tend to be conceited because of the author's writing style. For example, when we're getting to know the male hero, KS writes phrases such as ... \\"stunningly handsome,\\" as if the male character is describing himself, rather than letting this be a description from author to reader.	2003-01-24

Not only was it hard to follow, Brooke and Rafe were totally boring. Only when Peter and Lilly got together did it become even remotely interesting, and that was more than halfway through the book. And their relationship consisted mostly of phone conversations! <BR>As passionate as Rafe was about horses and flowers, why didn't he ever get his own place with his own horses and flowers? In the real world, he would have been considered something of a gold digger, or moocher.<BR>KS tends to use the same names for her characters in her books. Why?<BR>If you're new to KS's work, don't start with this one! I only finished it in deference to this usually talented author.	2003-01-19

I loved Justin, he was witty, handsome, and had one of the best personalities in a hero ever created. Evie was lovely and wonderful as well, and a perfect match for Justin. <BR>The problem? By about page 100, the outcome of this book was pretty well set. From the onset we know Evie and Justin will end up together, of course, but since the direction of the spy ring plot came out so early in the story, that was pretty much it for me, as that was the whole story.

I was a little surprised by the way in which KS shuffled around the love lives of the characters; I hadn't yet read many of her books.  Now I know she does this often.  <BR>James Sterling, whom I liked the best, was a great guy, but I was never convinced that he was a best friend to the senator. The rare times they appeared together, they were never more than cordial to one another; they talked as strangers would. <BR>Also, James should have been more responsible in his love life; it wasn't fair of him to let another man develop feelings for the one he loved, then want that man to walk away when he finally came to his senses.<BR>The plots were great, however, a very interesting story, and once again KS sweeps us away to foreign lands.	2003-01-05

How anyone can find this book tolerable is beyond me. The characters were bitter, and there was nothing at all sexy or romantic about these forced love scenes. A total disgrace. It took no imagination on JL's part to create this one because there was absolutely no plot to speak of. Rape is rape and is never ever justified.<BR>One thing about JL - at times she goes too far in making the main male character an absolute pig.  Warrick is certainly that!	2002-12-26

If not for Nicholas, Con, Lucien, and the rest of the Rogues, this book would have probably fallen flat. <br />Clarissa was great, and refreshingly assertive, and I liked the fact that she knew what - and who - she wanted and went after it - Hawk, to be exact. And even if she had failed in her quest to win Hawk's love, she had mentally prepared herself to go on with her life without total heartache.  <br />Hawk was a typical handsome, loyal, sensitive hero, but he seemed a mere secondary character here. The Rogues completely overshadowed him, not because of the author, but because of the personalities of these great guys.  As a military man, Hawk outranked some of the Rogues, and had at one time recruited Nicholas to seduce the Frenchwoman, but throughout most of the book, Hawk had to answer to these guys about money and his intentions towards Clarissa.  When things went awry towards the end, I found it hard to accept Hawk in a leadership role, with the Rogues deferring to him, but as the scene progressed, Hawk was brilliant, very intelligent. Although I was very glad to read about the rogues, especially Nicholas and Lucien, Hawk should have been this bold throughout the whole book. <br />Lucien, of course, was not there when Hawk took charge, but his presence was certainly felt, as befitted him.  A word of warning, however: If you haven't yet read about Lucien, you will NOT like him very much here. For some reason, JB went out of her way to make him so unlikable, and even as she softened him up slightly as the story progressed, you STILL won't like him if you're unfamiliar with the Rogues. Lucien, to put it mildly, has a temper problem. There will always be a dark cloud over him in my opinion, but I like him very much. <br />I strongly suggest you first read AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE, the great story of the awesome Nicholas Delaney.  Then read AN UNWILLING BRIDE, the outstanding novel about Lucien, the marquess of Arden.	2002-12-19

It was a well-written plot for two intelligent people. <BR>I really do hate how uppity JB makes these characters, though. Good lord, were they, the noble, really like that? For example, Rothgar \\"enters his painted and gilded sedan chair for a short trip to St. Jame's Palace. The liveried chairmen picked up the poles and set off.\\" Couldn't he just ride in a carriage? <BR>I realize JB knows her stuff and writes true to the era, but don't turn masculine, handsome, intelligent men like Rothgar into fops.<BR>JB did the same with Diana. Rothgar's long-time servant dies and is placed on the carriage seat beside Diana. \\"She didn't mind,\\" is what JB writes about Diana. The very idea that that had to be explained (or even contemplated) meant Diana thought him a lowly person. Rothgar, however, handled that situation splendidly, man to man, not Marquess to servant.<BR>So there were different classes of people, but please, JB, don't blatantly point it out by using terminology like:  she decided to walk in the garden among people of quality, rather than among mere tenants, I suppose.	2002-12-11

I liked the tastefulness, one doesn't need explicit love scenes to convey love. And all the characters (couples) were great with the exception of the main characters, Elizabeth and Nick. They were great at their jobs, very handsome people, and seemed very realistic, but I didn't like having to read nearly the entire book before they acknowledged their feelings for one another. Page 428 to be exact! And then Nick tried to stay away from her AGAIN! <BR><BR>Nick was a devilish, very handsome man with many redeeming qualities and he should have at least been allowed to date Elizabeth once in a while. For example, a lot is made of an upcoming formal ball Elizabeth and Nick will attend. They don't go together of course; the entire event is nothing about them. They say hello in the hotel lobby and that's the end of it. He didn't even compliment her on how lovely she looked.  These two rarely had more than a 3 second conversation, and rarely was it about themselves. I just thought Nicholas had such potential, but KS kept cutting him out of the story just as we were getting to know something about him.<BR>BR>Peter London's appearance was great; he made a good match for Larisa.	2002-12-04

This Rainy Day Kisses is another example of a boring read. I give it 1 star. Some readers must not realize that there are books out there that are very interesting, very romantic, and offer a decent plot. Fans of DM would probably appreciate better work from her.<br />**The Bride Price by Day Leclaire is an outstanding story, though it's too short! It was obvious Gideon and Piper were truly in love. One could almost feel the pain these two suffered in the past. He's handsome and she's lovely, which only adds to their appeal. The plot holds your interest, with a little humor thrown in.

Guess I didn't expect such explicit language or love scenes, although the water tower mentioned in the beginning should have been a huge clue.<BR>Phin was great - handsome, funny, and very intelligent!

I love what the author did with her, and his daughter was wonderful. I especially liked the way Sophie didn't try to fake her way into the girl's life. It was a 'take me as I am' attitude.<BR>The plot(s) was great!

I would have put Lyon with someone like Jade from GUARDIAN ANGEL, but Christina held up just fine. Only a strong, intelligent woman could compliment the handsome Lyon, one of the best heros ever. He was totally believable as a government agent, perhaps because I read about him in Guardian Angel first. <BR>With the exception of the 'tavern' incident, I don't recall him yelling overmuch. His fear for Christina's safety made him angry, which I understand, but he should have discussed it (yelled) with her privately.<BR>Other than that, Lyon had a very smart and healthy attitude toward women. For example: at one point he believes Christina might have already slept with a man. He never once condemns her in his mind, or thinks of her as a tramp, or gets angry because another has already touched her. He just wants Christina to love only him now. I thought that was great.<BR>I did keep assuming he would go to America to meet Christina's family. I wanted to see how he would interact with her Indian father, but it never happened.<BR>This book isn't as 'witty' as most of JG's others, where you'd find yourself laughing outright. It has a more serious tone to it, but it suits Lyon's personality this way. Christina's lovely and funny at just the right time. This one's a keeper.	2002-11-21

Kit was adorable and beautiful and Baron was sensitive and gentle. So why did Kit and Baron turn to ice? After they became lovers, they turned vicious towards each other. I can't figure out why the author did this. There was never a good explanation as to WHY this happened, either. Who wants to read about two characters who dislike each other that much?<BR>By mutual consent, Kit and Baron put unexplained personal animosity aside in order to sleep together. Meanwhile, the unexplained rage continued to build. I started dreading the rest of the story, but stuck with it in deference to SEP. There would have to have been at least a drop of love between these two in order to have the sort of ending SEP gave us. <BR>The slavery issue was unfortunately accurate, but there's no way Sophronia would have ended up so blessed in the end, not with such ignorance in the world during that time.	2002-11-14

After all, it's SEP and she's one of the best, wittiest, writers out there. But she's not perfect...as I mentioned, the beginning had me thinking twice, as it was kind of boring, and the second reason is SEP's love scenes. She's starting to get a little too -graphic- for lack of a better word, in an almost crude way. Most of her previous books had love scenes based on romance, not just sex.<BR>Otherwise, I loved this one. Gage and Isabel were wonderful, and the dialogue was outstanding; very, very funny. Given Gage's profession, he could have been aloof, even mysterious, (which he seemed to be in the beginning) but he was so down to earth. He's every girl's dream man.	2002-11-06

I don't know what I expected since these two were so great in their daughter's story, but I didn't expect constant feuding. When exactly did these two get along? Every day they fought, which would make for a very unhappy life. They didn't seem at all in love, either. Every story needs a little bickering, as long as no one loses sight of the fact that love is still in the air. But when an argument happens almost every time the couple converses, it makes for a very depressing story. I dreaded turning to the next page because I knew nothing happy would take place.  There wasn't one romantic love scene in the entire book! No woman, even then, would have put up with being violated over and over again. And I don't believe all men of that era were such pigs, either.	2002-11-05

There's something about Stefan, he's mysterious, handsome, and takes in a lot without having to say anything. I like the fact that he wants to know if Tanya can want him without knowing who he is.  I also like the way in which Stefan came to terms with his feelings for Tanya.  He believes her past is sordid, but it truly no longer matters to him because he loves her and is looking forward to their lives together. This is a story I could read again and again. It's really that good!<br />But... in the very beginning of the story, the author described Stefan as  \\"disfigured,\\" which wasn't exactly true.  As the story progressed Stefan was described as very handsome, and, like Tanya, I felt the scars on his cheek totally insignificant to the man he was. I didn't give them another thought - it was the author who kept on and on about them - for Tanya's benefit, I suppose, but it was annoying.  I don't know why JL felt the need to make such a big deal about it.  She might well have turned some readers off, thereby causing many to lose out on a very interesting story. <BR>Vasili was great! I actually reread ONCE A PRINCESS after reading his story YOU BELONG TO ME, and I liked and understood him much better.<BR>Also, another great book, better even than most of JL's books was THE ROSE OF ENCHANTMENT, Kathryn N Bender.

If you want to preserve your good opinion of the handsome and once-sweet, yet tough, Selig, skip this book altogether.	2002-11-05

I think publishers want the authors of today to spit out one or two hardcovers a year, assuming, (erronously) that loyal fans will simply read any garbage put before us. Anyone who bought this JL book did get suckered, I guess, but we romance readers learn quickly from out mistakes. JL should be held somewhat accountable, I suppose, after all, it's her imagination, or lack of, that gave us this story. Lincoln was definitely whiny, and babyish. I have never seen a more unmanly hero in my 25 years of reading.	2002-11-04

Royce is undoubtedly the best hero ever created. He lacked for nothing. Every line he spoke was perfect. Kristen was perfect for him! She was a great, lovely heroine. The story ended far too soon. I could have read more about these two!  The secondary characters were simply wonderful. Actually, I liked Kristen's parents much more in this book than I did in their own story, which was a little mundane. This is certainly a rereadable story.	2002-11-04

His own story didn't disappoint. I love the scenes with him and Tony! One of my favorite and most endearing is when James introduces Tony to his son. (In my opinion, Tony's own story fizzled horribly.) There wasn't a boring spot in this book, though. James is a handsome devil, and menacing when he needs to be. It's definitely worth reading again.<BR>Love the part where he walks in on \\"George\\" using the chamber pot!	2002-11-04

However, Lucien and Beth were a great couple, and the story was fantastic. He shouldn't have backhanded her: he knew it, we knew it, and the author knew it, as was her point. His love for her was so strong he panicked and went crazy in a single instant! I did think how they settled it immediately afterward was a little weak, with Beth simply asking him if it was ever going to happen again. He was deeply sorry, yet he answered her too nonchalantly. <BR>I was (almost) more irritated by everyone else's awareness of Lucien's good looks. When considering Beth for a wife, her attractiveness - or lack of - was far too important to him and to some of the other characters, mostly women. If you're 'plain-looking' you are not equal to someone of beauty. A less-confident woman than Beth would have crumbled. What a great gal she was! If you can get past those two parts of the story, it ends up being very enjoyable.<BR>Lucien was very intelligent, and after a while, was smart enough to see in Beth all the things that were important. It raised my respect for the guy immensely.	2002-11-01

In this instance, KW was talented enough to pull it off without losing the reader's interest. Wonderful characters! Alaina was a great heroine.

It was never pleasant to have them in the same room together. As easy going as Anthony was, in this book he's forced to become very moody and depressed, not to mention terribly unhappy.

Rape is a difficult subject for any author to tackle, but it's the story JB gave us, so one can either go with it or lay the book aside if this is an unacceptable premise. All women would understand.<BR>That being said...<BR>I absolutely loved Nicholas. Yes, he had to sleep with 'that woman', which in a romance surprised me, for the hero is usually loyal. I certainly wouldn't want my husband involved in such a thing, but we do learn that Nicholas was too deeply involved in his work to stop the charade when he married the wonderful Eleanor. He WAS sickened by it, which made it easier to forgive him, I guess. That, and his obviously growing love for Eleanor. I think he was tortured enough. Nicholas was very masculine, intelligent and slightly roguish. And of course, handsome. One of my favorite scenes was when he introduced Eleanor to his friends, his fellow Rogues. I count this novel among my top 10 favorites of all time.	2002-11-01

In THE GIFT, he's great, so realistic because he has a few endearing FLAWS. He's a clumsy romantic with so much appeal, and is very very handsome. He's so masculine you just know he's not afraid of anything. Sara was a true delight, despite the fact that nearly all of JG's heroines are identical in character, with the exception of Jade from GUARDIAN ANGEL. Most of JG's heroines start out being a little bit scatter-brained, with every hero believing her DAFT. Eventually the intellect of the heroine shines through. And I will say that JG's heroines are never, ever, stupid. In fact, after finishing this book, I realize what made the adorable Sara different from the others. She wasn't quite as DAFT as she appeared to be; everything she said and did, she did for a specific reason.<BR><BR>Now, the FRECKLES thing has got to stop.<BR> <BR>As for humor, this book is one of JG's best. That's part of the reason Nathan and Sara were so interesting. You could practically feel Nathan's frustration when dealing with Sara, but she was so comical he didn't stand a chance.<BR>One of the funniest scenes out of all JG's books, takes place here in THE GIFT. It's when Sara meets Sterns, the butler. It doesn't get much funnier than that.	2002-10-11

There are so many wonderful facets to Jade's personality, only the genius of JG could pull it off.<br /><br />Caine was promising in the beginning, but his appeal tapered off drastically. And I didn't like how he would grab Jade's hand and squeeze hard enough to hurt her (and not let go for the duration of the scene), simply to prevent her from leaving the room or to find her own chair. That was strange.<br /><br /> It was a little crude when Jade's Uncle Harry said that he should have cut Jade's face when she was younger because she was so beautiful. A little over the top, I think.<br /><br /> But all in all, the actual story was good. I'm glad Lyon was in it as much as he was, and I liked Nathan and Colin. The servant Sterns was a great character.	2002-10-10

With the exception of a brief appearance in the beginning, we don't see him again until page 148! His friend Nicholas was okay to lead off the story I guess, but did the author have to go on and on about this guy? I could have cared less about his boring relationship with Elise, because HE wasn't the hero, it was going nowhere and the reader knew it.  A hundred or so pages of this was really getting on my nerves. This was the reason I couldn't give this book 5 stars. After that, the story was GREAT, one of the best love stories ever. So yes, it's well worth the irritation to get through the beginning. Maxim was one of the best heros ever. Handsome, witty, very masculine, and very respectful of Elise. The author did a great job of making us believe Maxim had a natural respect for women in general. It was subtle, but very well done. Take for example when Maxim finds Elise in a seedy tavern. Read what he says to her when they're leaving. Most heros would have berated the heroine mightily for being there.<BR>I think it was also very clear that Maxim and Elise were very much in love. She was great, witty, too, especially with Fitch and Spence. I don't usually like books where the hero starts out having lost all his riches, but Maxim was so great a character, I was able to overlook that. He and Elise are one of the best couples in romance!	2002-10-10

It's still a classic, still one of the best, and probably responsible for most of us continuing to read romance novels... And yes, a lot of thoughts and feelings did seem to be based on what the characters looked like. The other reviewer was right, bad meant ugly, good meant beautiful. I wouldn't have used rape for the story, but since the author did, I will say that she carried us through it well. And ...there's something about this book, several reasons why it's ended up as a long-standing favorite among lots of readers. Maybe it was the day to day life and activities aboard the ship, wondering if the next day would be happy or uncomfortable. I was always interested in what Brandon would say in each scene. The brother Jeff was great and appealing, much more so than in his own story. A great read, one to hold onto, one worth rereading.	2002-10-09

The story was merely okay, and I'd looked forward to reading about Jeff. But this was not the same guy from The Flame &amp; The Flower. The author totally changed his personality. Also, I like depth and a decent plot, not books where the hero and heroine are constantly bickering and at battle with one another. That would make for a very unhappy life, living day to day like that. It leaves the reader dreading every scene where the characters converse.	2002-10-09

Not to mention the setting of Hong Kong, a place wherein the author made you feel like you were there. I could read this one over and over. James was my favorite character.

There's lots wrong with this book, but the plot is top notch. Jade's one of the best heroines ever. And one can't ever discount JG's talent, wit and humor - unmatched by any other author. However, I wasn't overly pleased with Caine. I hated the way he groveled over Jade when he decided he loved her. I never really got the convincing feeling he was that handsome, strong, masculine, or anything else, unlike, say, Gabriel from 'Saving Grace.' Now he was the perfect hero. NO FLAWS. I usually find JG's arrogant, macho heros endearing and loveable, but this Caine fellow was abusively possessive. It's one thing for the hero to give his lady a possessive stare, a jealous growl, even a word or two about how she 'belongs' to him, but Caine bruised Jade by grabbing her arms! What an idiot! Jade, as I mentioned, was truly a great character, very strong, very intelligent, until her relationship with Caine became serious. Then she turned into an imbecile, weak, submissive, and ignorant. Here was a woman who'd survived by her wits, and along comes Caine, who thinks she can't even walk without him telling her to put one foot in front of the other. <BR>In the fabulous book, THE GIFT, Caine is a totally different character. He's a mild gentleman. But Jade is nearly unrecognizable. She's so overly domesticated her spirit seems to have been crushed somewhere along the way.	2002-10-08

But I certainly didn't like having to read so far into the book before Maxim became involved in the story. I thought way too much time was devoted to Nicholas and Elise. Nicholas was okay, but certainly not hero material to me. In fact, I almost discarded it altogether for that very reason, but I stuck with it and I must say I'm glad I did. Maxim and Elise were great! Well-suited, truly in love. I realize men back then claimed to 'own' their wives, but I don't think readers need say anything about Maxim's respect for Elise. It was subtle, yet respectful in every way. And he was so handsome! The dialogue was great, a very interesting story. I don't think the author should change this writing style at all. She knows what she's doing. I read lots of books, and this one is one of the best (if you skip through the beginning).	2002-10-08

Sure, it has flaws, and yes, Brenna should have been ashamed for complaining about her looks when in fact in real life, she'd probably outshine most women. I don't think she was unhappy with herself at all, she just needed someone to confirm she was perfectly shaped, and whined doing it.  This gal's got ego problems. She knows she looks great, but needs others to confirm it.<BR>Now, Connor was great. Handsome, witty, and an all around great warrior.<BR>I thought the prologue boring, and if they'd chased that pig a second longer, I'd have thrown the book out the window! Overall, the story was very good, in true Garwood fashion. Brenna and Connor's love story is a 5 star, but with that prologue, it loses a star. Is it just me, or are all JG's prologues too long and boring? <BR>Alec & Jamie were great in this. Alec and his daughter Grace nearly stole the show, though. This book is certainly well worth reading.	2002-09-26

I found Nick and Laurant very believable in their affections.  I thought the entire story had enough romance &amp; suspense to keep the reader entertained.

Gabriel was simply perfect - handsome, masculine, sensitive and yes, arrogant, but it worked well for him. It was amusing to me. Johanna was clearly the love of his life, and we knew this well. No silly games involved here. Thank God! As strong as Johanna turned out to be, I thought she came across as kind of ditzy in the beginning of the story, but I overlooked it and loved her anyway. I'm not sure why, but I always hesitate to read a book when the synopsis says the heroine was married before, but I'm so glad I didn't forgo this great book. But why on earth JG chose to make Johanna a 13 year old bride (first marriage) is beyond me. I was a little disturbed by that. The warriors constantly underfoot were magnificant! What a great job JG did with these guys! I love the way she does that!	2002-08-30

The Prologue is extremely serious, but you'll soon find yourself laughing outright, mostly when the lovable little boy, Alec Maitland is involved.<BR>*The ever-present group of friends loyal to the hero, and ultimately, the heroine is a wonderful idea. The characters are always subtle yet charming. JG should definitely stick to this format. (In fact, I was slightly disappointed JG didn't include such a group in the wonderful book HEARTBREAKER.)<BR>*The story of Brodick and Gillian is witty, romantic, and thoroughly enjoyable. I love how they met! <BR>**BUT...like so many others, I was equally interested in Ramsey and Bridgid. JG should find a way to write their story, no doubt about it. I confess, I read the book the 2nd time with Ramsey & Bridgid in mind first, Brodick & Gillian, second. Both couples are equally endearing. This is the kind of book you can't put down and one you certainly don't want to end.	2002-08-15
