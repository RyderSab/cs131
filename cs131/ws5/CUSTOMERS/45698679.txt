US	45698679	R2H8DOYR94AK8	0385505914	870481550	Train: A Novel	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Really 4 and 1/2 stars.	This was my first encounter with Pete Dexter's writing, and it certainly makes me want to find his other works.  This novel avoids the cliches and easy answers that many books dealing with race seem to embrace, and that makes it a welcome change from other works.<br />It is 1950's era Los Angeles, and the three main characters are headed for a kind of awkward collision through the course of its pages. There's a mysterious detective (who doesn't do much detecting, oddly), an heiress who is the victim of a horrific attack, and the title character who caddies and eventually golfs his way into a kind of respectability. Dexter's brilliance resides in his ability to describe concisely both the characters and the scene, building his plot through seemingly small events to a logical conclusion.<br />This book will appeal to people familiar with film noir and its trappings, but it will also resonate with anyone interested in the recent past and the plight of African-Americans and those who have exploited race issues for their own ends. Parts made me angry, and other parts gave me a real sense of how Train saw the world.<br />Any time a writer can open a world for me, I feel better when finishing his work. Although it's not a feel good kind of book, Train did give me a fresh perspective on the recent past.	2003-11-13

Lionel Essrog, his main character, has Tourette's Syndrome, but it's not a gimmick ... it's an integral characteristic of an interesting man.<br />As Lionel attempts to unravel the central mystery, it becomes clear that he is more than he appears, both to the readers and the people around him. I came to like him very much, and better, I came to understand him. There is no higher praise to an author than that he opened a new world to his readers, and Motherless Brooklyn is one of those rare books that does just that.<br />Lethem has gotten rave reviews for his new novel, Fortress of Solitude, but you should start here. Now that he's getting recognition, Lethem will be a literary force for the near future.	2003-10-27
US	45698679	R1KEY9UQXJ1AN	0765304015	96820989	White Apples	Books	4	17	17	N	N	Not for everyone, but	If you're reading this, it's likely that it is for you. Jonathan Carroll is hard to categorize, and this book is relatively typical of his style and theme. The book's protagonist doesn't realize that he's dead (I'm not giving anything away -- it's on the back cover), and White Apples follows the series of revelations and transformations he's about to undergo as a result of the chain of events his growing &quot;enlightenment&quot; provokes. <br />The main complaint that people have about this novel is that it seems incomplete or fails to give the reader a tidy package at its conclusion: don't be put off by those criticisms, rather embrace them. Carroll doesn't write easy fiction with simple answers. If you like to ruminate about characters and themes after you finish reading, then this novel (and other Carroll novels) is for you.<br />White Apples comes with a reader's guide at the end that would be especially handy if you're part of a group or if you like to get an idea of what others make of the novel. I've become increasingly disenchanted with mainstream fiction and the predictability of many authors ... if this description fits you as well, it's probably time to start reading the likes of Jonathan Carroll, China Mieville, A.M. Homes, George Saunders, and the other writers who show that fiction can still be surprising.	2003-09-20

Simple to read, the novel has an interesting rhythm to it as the reader becomes more familiar with Christopher's disability. While I initially thought it would become repetitive, the story takes some turns to make it a consistently enjoyable reading experience.<br />Christopher begins to write the book to solve the mystery of the murder of Wellington, a neighbor's dog, like his hero Sherlock Holmes. Along the way, we learn about his family situation, his view of the world, his idiosyncrasies, and his school life. He's not exactly an unreliable narrator, but the author does an excellent job of imagining the problems involved when the storyteller has autism and the story is consistent with this perspective.<br />While not a perfect book, I would recommend this highly, especially to people who want a fresh and different reading experience. It's not at all preachy, and it deals with a little understood disability with honesty; this reader came away from the book with a new understanding of the difficulties of dealing with autism. It is well worth your time to pick this one up.	2003-06-21
US	45698679	R1AOQIJ6DK8DH7	0316168688	744408823	The Dogs of Babel	Books	5	213	231	N	N	Be careful even though it's wonderful.	I finished this book three days ago, and I still have strong feelings floating around because of it. The Dogs of Babel is an emotionally painful reading experience, and for me, one of the most intensely sad books I've ever encountered (but that's a good thing -- genuine emotion is hard to come by in this post-modern meta-fiction riddled contemporary literary period).<br />You've probably read how this book is about a man, Paul Iverson, who is trying to teach his dog to tell him why his wife died in a fall ... but it's not a gimmicky book. It's about grieving, self-examination, love, and how complicated people and relationships can be. People complain that there are plot events that are unrealistic or far-fetched, but I'd contend that they are missing the point: this is the most emotionally honest book I've come across recently. As the reader learns more about Paul and his wife, he becomes more invested in Paul's plight, so much so that the pain is real and raw. If you want to feel for a character in a novel, then this book is certainly for you.<br />The caveat, though, is that The Dogs of Babel is an intense experience, which may not be for you depending on your current circumstances. If I had recently experienced a loss, I doubt I could've gotten through it at all (at least without a breakdown). I'd also be careful if you're feeling emotionally fragile since I can't get it out of my head three days later with no end in sight for me (when was the last time a book hung around with you for some time after you finished it?).	2003-06-12

If you look back to 1983, Granta selected the likes of Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, and Kazuo Ishiguro as the outstanding young British writers. They next had the issue in 1993, where they were less successful in projecting the new award winners and critically praised novelists.<br />There are good stories throughout this volume, though I liked the Ben Rice and Sarah Waters stories the best. The really nice part of a short fiction collection like this one is that you're bound to find a new writer that you'll follow for the next 10 years. As weak as I thought the 1993 collection of writers, I still found Iain Banks, perhaps the best genre-busting writer of the recent past, and Jeanette Winterson.<br />If you enjoy finding a fresh voice or you just like reading a good story, I think you'll find this edition of Granta well worth your time. I don't always pick up this sort of magazine because they are often loaded with less than stellar short fiction by otherwise good writers, but this particular issue has many excellent short pieces that will lead you to find the upcoming novels from these artists.	2003-05-10
US	45698679	R1PVKGUS7P97Z2	0151008116	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Parts are excellents while others are tedious	This is a very uneven read. The early parts of the book are fascinating, especially in their insight into the family dynamic that Pi faces. If the rest of the novel had matched the parts describing life at the zoo, his brother's interaction with him, and his dabbling at a variety of religions, then the life of Pi could have been much more powerful.<br />Unfortunately, the better known part of the novel, Pi's stay adrift a lifeboat in the Pacific with Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger, is slow and relatively uninteresting. One must slug through this section of the novel. Looking through the reader reviews, some must not have found it this way, but for me, the lack of action of any kind mirrors the hopelessness Pi must feel at his own plight.<br />The ending redeems much of this, and the character of Pi is well drawn throughout the novel. Again I am at a loss to understand the Mann Booker Prize being awarded to a seriously flawed novel when an excellent book like Fingersmith by Sarah Waters is passed over. If you are looking for a riveting read, go for Fingersmith ... its 500 pages go much faster than Life of Pi.	2003-04-27

This book concerns the opposition between two cultures and two couples that live in close proximity in Southern California. This is only a physical nearness, however, because the two couples, like the two cultures, counldn't be farther apart.<br />The point of view shifts between Delaney and Kyra, two well-to-do liberal yuppies, and Candido and America, two illegal immigrants fighting to work and make a life for themselves in a nearby makeshift campsite. Their lives intersect at different points in the story, and though some may find it contrived, it works in driving the conflict between the characters.<br />As a reader, I did feel the conflict ... at times I rooted for Candido and America, and other times I realized that I'd probably feel much like the suburbanites who hate and fear them. I guess that's the point. I did come away from the book with the distinct impression that California may have the weather advantage most of the time, but the drawbacks presented here make me glad to be 3000 miles away.<br />Overall this is a good reading experience: there are characters to care about, ideas to think about, and a good story to follow. It is well worth your time.	2003-04-07

Somehow the story didn't appeal to me at all, people dead on a beach, decomposing, and the plot didn't look like it could possibly move forward. So why did I pick it up ... because I have great respect for Jim Crace.<br />The protagonists die right at the beginning of the novel (I'm not telling you anything that's not on the back of the book here), and the story moves backward in time, so you find out about them, like them, knowing what happens to them. In a way, it reminded me of the movie Memento, which has a similar plot device. Crace, however, uses it in quite a different way: he is not building suspense, rather he is developing the characters, letting us get to know them and think about their fate and the twists that preceded it.<br />If you've never read a Jim Crace book, this might be the best to start with, but I'd also recommend The Gift of Stones as a starting point. Crace's books are very different from one another, so each one remains a unique experience. Even if you don't think this one will appeal to you, you might be as surprised as I was how long Being Dead will stay with you and keep you thinking about it.	2003-03-09
US	45698679	R2LPTD05R4L7ZI	0380789035	337033298	American Gods	Books	4	5	9	N	N	A book that evokes strong opinions.	This book has caused more arguments among my friends and colleagues than any in recent memory, and for me, that's a good thing. I like the book, others love it, and some hate it with a passion. Flipping through the reviews, I see the same strength of opinion here.<br />The reason to recommend the book is the depth of allusion and the fun you'll have trying to figure who's who. Having a solid background in mythology of all kinds helps, but having a sense of humor and irony is required. The plot's the thing with Gaiman, so throw aside notions of the importance of sweeping literary prose and overly deep characterization: just enjoy the story. If you're looking for beautiful sentences, then look elsewhere.<br />Try to ignore the extreme reviews as well. This is an interesting story about the battle between the old gods (Norse, Greek, Irish, etc.) brought over with the immigrants and the new gods (TV, the internet, etc.). A good concept here ... it is well executed as well. Yeah, Gaiman's not a great writer in the purest sense, and yeah, he is not likely to win the Booker, but some of those writers can't write a story like he can. Live with it.	2003-02-19
US	45698679	RWKLYVZGFLBO4	0374239622	980961835	Quarantine: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	He makes you think.	Jim Crace's novels are so different from one another that it's hard to believe they're written by the same person. Quarantine, that's ostensibly about Christ's 40 days in the desert, really revolves around the others staying in caves while Christ goes through his forty day fast.<br />The other characters are very interesting: there is a woman who wishes her husband had stayed dead, there is a merchant suffering from a terminal illness, and there are several other unique individuals to interact with these. The novel's central idea involves the self-imposed suffering of people and their reasons for it.<br />This novel will likely upset those with strong views on either side of this issue in terms of religion. The funny part of that, however, is that the novel isn't really about religion per se, it's about the way that people perceive religion. All in all, this is a thought-provoking novel well worth your time.	2003-02-16

I won't rehash the plot here, but this is a sprawling family history spanning some 80 or so years. The narrator, as a character, makes her/his first appearance rather late in the book, and that's a shame. I found the first part with the history of the grandparents rather tedious, but later parts, like a riot in Detroit or the narrator's journey away from her/his parents very interesting. Overall, the novel was uneven: You should realize that some parts of the book may really drag for you as they did for me ...<br />There are many things to recommend about the novel: (1) the prose is often beautiful; (2) the characters are vivid, though I found some of them rather uninteresting as people; (3) the use of myth and classical allusions made parts fascinating.<br />If family sagas aren't your thing, I don't think you'll love this ... you'll probably come away feeling as I did. I think some of the praise is over the top, and I also believe Oprah probably would've picked it at some point if she still had her book club (which, for me, was the kiss of death).	2003-02-16

I came to this book when a friend handed it to me saying, \\"It's by the foremost lesbian novelist in the world.\\" Not exactly sure what to expect, based on that comment, I started reading. That characterization (which I've seen repeated in reviews) is unfair and does a great disservice to a wonderful novel, because it makes one believe that it promotes a viewpoint or that the story revolves around that narrow issue.<br />As to the story, it involves two orphans, a plot to deceive, arcane books, weird noblemen, machinations of all kinds, and in short, every gothic device imaginable. It has echoes of Dickens, Jane Eyre, and modern masters of the thriller. Don't let anyone tell you much about the plot ... I just envy you the experience of reading it.<br />It is very rare that I can find the time to finish a near 600 page book in under a week, but Fingersmith gave me little choice. It has wonderfully drawn characters, astounding plotting, and enough interesting elements to make you stay up way past when you want to. Go read it.	2003-02-10

The audiobook is paced well, and Auster does a good job with the reading -- authors are very often poor at reading their own novels.<br />As to the novel, I was completely drawn into the story, and I like the layered plotting and lack of easy answers. The story concerns a man whose loss of his family has left him shattered. He loses himself in the story of a vanished silent film star, and in researching this man, he is brought into a relationship with a damaged woman. Auster's writing is incredible, and the allusions to Hollywood reporting, Hawthorne's short stories, and ultimately to the nature of illusions are consistently interesting and used well throughout the novel.<br />Initially I avoided the book because I'm not much interested in silent movies, and the jacket blurbs just didn't excite me. Don't make the same mistake I did in putting this off ... and if you commute, listen to the audiobook, it's well worth the price.	2003-02-08

I had just finished a truly wonderful book, The Roaches Have No King, and this one was continually compared to that one. While it was inventive and different, I found it ultimately unsatisfying as a reading experience.<br />The positive: this book takes a very interesting approach as everything is described by use of olfactory impression. The story is interesting at times, and compelling near the end. It is, like the main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, unrelenting in its drive toward its conclusion. The ending even makes sense given the preceding storyline.<br />The problem: With those positives, there is a big caveat. It is very hard to care at all for the character, and even in his evil, he is ultimately boring. Many times I felt like saying to the author, \\"Okay, I get it.\\" If you need to have some feeling for character to like a book, avoid this one.<br />This book will appeal to the reader looking for a strictly different reading experience because of its unique approach. I would say that if that is what you want, you should try the one I already mentioned, namely The Roaches Have No King by Daniel Evan Weiss, which is superior in many ways to Perfume. It, too, has elements that will disturb some readers, but it has a good heart (although somewhat demented).	2002-10-17

It is a book about the nature of stories, the nature of people, and the ways that we think about ancient peoples. Most of all, though, it makes the reader think about how change affects individuals and groups ... all through the story of a young man and his daughter.<br />If a book about the stone age conjures images of The Clan of the Cave Bear for you, then wipe it from your mind before starting this. The Gift of Stones starts from a simple premise: an archaeologist has found the amputated arm bone of a young boy, and he and his colleagues imagine what must have been his life. This young man also imagines lives, and tells those stories, much to the delight of his village. His daughter carries on the tradition as the true narrative voice of the book.<br />I had never read any of Crace's work before this slim volume, but I've already gone out to buy all of them. He   is a wonderful writer without over-writing or involving himself in senseless wordplay. If you are looking for a thought-provoking story with memorable characters, then this book is definitely for you.	2002-09-22

It is funny, touching, and memorable.<br />The protagonist, a cockroach named Numbers, has big plans. He wants to get Ira Fishblatt's very messy girlfriend to come back to the apartment ... so that the plentiful food will return with her. He has a problem, though, because the strength and longevity of his species derives from their inherent lack of cooperative effort. The title is their best attribute: their selfishness is their strength.<br />Hilarity ensues as Numbers' plans hit a variety of snags, and I found myself rooting for this very unusual insect. It is a well-written novel, and the pages fly by. If you have the stomach for it, this makes for a different and interesting reading experience.	2002-09-22

In the beginning, I really liked the portrait of seedy New York, then it dragged for a while, then I liked it, and finally I was lukewarm about the resolution. Overall, though, it was enjoyable, funny, and thoroughly without redeeming characters.<br />William Paulinha (aka Master Chao) reads a few books on feng shui so that he can con the rich effetes out of their money. Interestingly, he really believes that feng shui works, so sometimes he uses this power for evil when arranging people's houses. There are several very funny scenes about interior decorating, snobby parties, and Chao's observations about human nature.<br />The problem with the book, which I ultimately enjoyed, is that there are no characters to like much at all ... if that's a problem for you. If you want a funny, cutting, not nice view of the world, then step right up to Fixer Chao.	2002-09-14

Better than any other book, it presents the philosophical underpinnings of our ethics as people and Americans in the characters of the Kid (protagonist) and the Judge (the character of most interest). The book is rich with allusion, language, and stunning passages -- my book is marked up and dog-eared from my first reading.<br />Go and read this book if you have a love for literature ... this is a book that will survive as a classic. It may not be the best novel of the last 25 years, but I'd be hard-pressed to name a better one. Like any great work of literature, I have many questions about the novel, things I'd like to discuss with friends, arguments that I'd like to have about it. It's a real shame that McCarthy is most associated with All The Pretty Horses which is a FAR inferior novel, but it often happens to great novelists.<br />This final message: if you have, like me, disliked the sappiness of McCarthy's Border Trilogy, don't be put off. If you are a fan of his books, and missed this one, then read it immediately.	2002-09-01

I am very much a fan of this kind of historical/literary thriller, so I had high expectations for the book when I spotted it on a bookstore shelf. Without going over the parallel plotlines in depth, it concerns a book finder named Isaac Inchbold and another story of the book he is trying to find. The wealth of details might have put me off, but I had jury duty when I started (and finished) the book, so I had plenty of &quot;quiet time&quot; to go back and forth in the book. If you don't like going back to find details, this book may not be for you.<br />Ultimately, the stories do converge, and the ending does make sense, but it is deriative of many other similar tales. The final impact of the book is negligible, but still, if you are looking for a pleasurable historical mystery, this book will suffice.<br />There are three much superior books in this genre that I would, however, recommend first: The Name of the Rose by Eco; An Instance of the Fingerpost by Pears; and Club Dumas by Perez-Reverte. All are both wonderful novels, but Club Dumas is probably the most accessible.	2002-08-26

My ten year old son read this first in one sitting (!), and I picked it up after he finished. I also read this all in an afternoon. While I think some of the reviews are a bit over the top, I heartily recommend this alternate world fantasy. I think it will especially appeal to the 10-13 year old age group, but adults who enjoy children's literature will also like it.<br />Coraline has moved into a new house, and her neglectful parents send her to count the doors in the house to be rid of her for a while. She knows that this is their plan, but she does it anyway. On the other side of the \\"extra\\" door, there is another world ... with perhaps nicer \\"other\\" parents. Of course there are complications, and this is where the novel takes off.<br />Neil Gaiman is an excellent fantasy novelist, and I would also recommend Neverwhere and American Gods (both are adult novels in reading level and American Gods has some adult content).	2002-08-26

I found the first hundred or so pages very tough going (truly brutal), and I just about gave up on the book. If I hadn't read Pears' work before, I probably wouldn't have finished this, and I would have missed the fabulous rest of the novel.<br />The three stories are intertwined, and they each have an integral part in the other two tales. The last 50 or so pages are wonderful, thought-provoking, and probably controversial for its conclusion. I think any reader who finds the subject matter interesting, i.e. the nature of civilization and the philosophy of civilizing influences, will probably have the &quot;mental toughness&quot; to slog through the difficult beginning. Take it from this reader that it is all worthwhile in the end.<br />A few warnings regarding the book: this is a novel of ideas, and, as such, none of the characters (except perhaps Julian in WWII era Avignon) are particularly well-developed -- certainly none as compelling as in Instance's narrators; idealistic readers will probably be disappointed by the unrelenting pragmatism of this work (sort of like attending a Jesuit university).<br />If you are willing to invest the time and effort, this book is well worth it.	2002-08-20

Both are excellent novels, and they introduce two of the characters from this book. It'd also be good to read Thunderhead as well (Nora Kelly is introduced there). That aside, this book is another page-turner from this duo.<br />Preston and Child are masters of the just one more chapter school of writing. They use multiple storylines that make it hard to stop: just as you get to a critical &quot;I need to know what happens&quot; point, they switch to the other storyline, and it makes it so you can't stop.<br />This one starts out simply enough as the archaeological investigation of a century old serial killer, but as with all of their novels, there is a scientific-fantasical explanation in store for us. We are treated to sub-basements, old houses, museum archives, and old family secrets. For the true Preston-Child fan, we find out about Pendergast's background (finally!), and for the first-timer, you get the joy of discovering one of the best thriller writing teams of all. A special note to fans of Preston-Child, check out Michael Connelly's The Poet! You'll love it.	2002-07-04

The Sooterkin is a nice first novel, and it is interesting for most of its 200+ pages, but it is not a directly involving story. The conflict is spread out among its main characters, and it reads like a modern TV show with an ensemble cast. I liked the story, but if you are looking for a traditional novel with one main character, then this isn't for you.<br />The novel follows a minister on a cross country journey, a young boy looking for his &quot;brother,&quot; a mother who may or may not have given birth to a seal, and assorted characters who come in and disappear quickly in this novel that takes place in 1800's Tasmania. Each of this vignette-style sections is interesting, but the whole comes up a bit shorter than the parts.<br />I look forward to Gilling's next effort as I think he'll develop into a fine novelist based on this, but for me, this was good but not brilliant. If you are interested in Austrailia and its environs, particularly in the area of historical fiction, try Matthew Kneale's English Passengers or Peter Carey's True History of the Kelly Gang (both are superior novels).	2002-06-21

I was pulled in by the positive reviews, the branding of the author as genius, and the wide heralding of the great American novel finally having been written ... then I read it.<br />About 50 pages into the book, I gave up on the hype and just wanted to enjoy the book ... but that's not even possible. It is repetitive (dogs farting isn't really funny once, but many times becomes tiresome), and the supposedly fresh voice of broken English becomes old very fast.<br />I generally disregard negative reviews from customers as everyone has different tastes, but this is a bit different since it's barely understandable in many places. If you're looking for a fresh voice in fiction, try Tracy Chevalier, Manil Suri, Ben Rice, or George Saunders. Stay away from this: you've been warned.<br />I know that many will not find this \\"helpful,\\" but come back and read this again after you've suffered through this mess of a book.	2002-06-01

A friend recommended Michael Connelly when I said I hadn't read a really good thriller since Riptide by Preston and Child. I got the Poet the next day, and I read it in three big gulps. There are many parts of the book where it is simply impossible to stop reading.<br />I'll stay away from the plot(and I recommend you stay away from reviews that tell you too much), but it involves a likeable narrator, the FBI profilers, a truly creepy villain, and many plot twists that still make sense after you catch your breath.<br />If you are looking for a thriller, and you don't have to get to sleep soon, then this book is certainly for you. I plan to read all of the Michael Connelly books this summer, and that's the highest praise I can give an author.	2002-06-01

I can't even say what caught my eye about it. After reading it, however, I heartily recommend the book.<br />The story starts with an amnesiac detective in the mid-19th century in London. As he returns to duty, he needs to rediscover himself as much as he needs to solve the case that he is assigned. I particularly enjoyed the idea that Monk, the protagonist, didn't like his old self that much (even though I don't think amnesia would change a person's basic traits). In any case, the Crimean War background, along with fine writing, make this historical mystery stand out. I plan to read other Monk novels after giving myself a short break.<br />I think this book will mainly appeal to two types of readers: first, hardcore mystery readers will enjoy the twists and turns of a traditional &quot;let's gather in the library so I can tell you who did it&quot; mystery; second, readers of historical fiction will enjoy, as I did, the gas-lit streets of London, the withdrawing rooms, and the spiritual depression of the British following the catastrophe that was the Crimean War.<br />All in all, this is a quick read that combines an interesting plot with high quality writing.	2002-05-12

Many others have given plot details, sometimes too much detail, so I'm going to avoid anything after the very beginning of the story.<br />A father loses his daughter's imaginary friends, so his son, the narrator, is forced to go in search of them. It sounds simple, and it is just so. But it is also so much more: the book speaks loudly about faith, love, children's perceptions, and the way that people doubt and hurt others.<br />I've given this book to other people, and they've given it to others. We put it on our summer reading list at school, and, in all of that, I've yet to hear a negative comment. There is only one warning I'd issue about this book: once you start it, you may not be able to find any place to stop ... even the second or third time you read it. I only wish that Ben Rice were more prolific a writer.	2002-05-04

That being said, if you like Johnson, you'll like Saunders.<br />The title story is probably the best in this collection, though I think the &quot;400 Pound CEO&quot; is a close second. Both of these stories have a cruel sense of irony, likeable characters who can't seem to get much right, and a wicked ending. There is a pattern to Saunders' work, but I've never found it monotonous because of the variety of events and turns of plot.<br />If you're interested in very different fiction, then pick up this slim volume. Be prepared to laugh and be prepared to be more than a little disturbed.	2002-04-28

I certainly enjoy classic poetry, but I also enjoy parody and fun poetry. This short book has some absolutely hysterical poems, and many of them parallel the classics. The title poem is actually making a great point about how the reckless people in life force the rest of us to yield to their desires.<br />The more bizarre/extreme works in the collection might offend some people, but if you have a good sense of humor and don't get upset easily, then you'll certainly enjoy this work.<br />A quick story: I brought this book into school and passed it around the English department ... almost everyone found a poem to read aloud, and we all had fun discussing them. The consensus favorite was the poem &quot;Reunion,&quot; where Coen perfectly hits what goes on at the 10, 20, or 25 year high school reunion. Pick this up and pass it on ... you'll laugh at the least.	2002-04-26
US	45698679	R2XK6G3JU85AEQ	0679777547	582743995	The Club Dumas	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Don't worry about the bad movie version ...	Arturo Perez-Reverte is a mystery/thriller writer with a decidedly intellectual bent. When I first started looking for his work, I expected it to be in the general fiction or literature section of the book store, but finally found it listed under mystery. This is a wonderful book for people who like books in the way that antique people like the antiques roadshow on PBS. It revels in the details of book-making, old texts, and bindings. Lucas Corso, the main character, is trying to discover the link between a fragment of a Dumas manuscript and a possibly Satanic text.<br />Though the movie version, the Ninth Gate, goes whole hog on the occult angle, the book is more about the Dumas manuscript and its connection to the other book. This makes the movie really irrelevant to the enjoyment of the book, other than if you liked the general idea of the movie, then this book is surely for you.<br />If you like to go to second hand book stores, or you enjoy talking about an old book, or if you go to garage sales to look through the old books, then Club Dumas is your type of book. I like Perez-Reverte's ability to go off on small tangents as part of the story, as when he digresses to discuss the ways to restore an old book or insert pages to complete it ... this may not appeal to everyone, but he doesn't use anything that isn't essential to an understanding of the plot.	2002-04-22
US	45698679	RTA21N0X6R2WB	0385494246	654180128	Amsterdam: A Novel	Books	4	25	27	N	N	Not McEwan's best, but that's still very good	I've become a real fan of Ian McEwan this past year, and though I'm not completely through his catalog, I'm very impressed with his ability to have great ideas within a tight story. This may be his tightest story ... it moves very quickly, and the book can be finished in 3 to 4 hours.<br />The main characters, a composer and a newspaper editor, become embroiled in a political scandal that relates to the affair each has had with a recently deceased woman. Their friendship becomes strained, and the miscommunication that develops drives the story. The story moves quickly, and I disagree with those who dislike the ending -- it does work, at least for me.<br />I also think this book works as a good introduction to McEwan. Its spare style is indicative of his work. When you've finished this book, move on to Atonement or Enduring Love: both are excellent books.<br />A few general words about Ian McEwan. He pays great attention to the word choice in each sentence, but unlike some other post modern types, he has a real story with a real conflict. Among modern writers, there seems to be some dislike of plotting, but McEwan shows that you can write about interesting ideas and have a good story as well.	2002-04-21
US	45698679	R2QVBC5FA0WGPV	0375421041	27158829	The Dark Room: A Novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	An interesting twist on WW2 literature	These three novellas take a different approach from the usual in WW2 literature: they present the difficulties for the German people. I happened to think that the middle novella, Lore, was the strongest. Lore's parents have been captured by the Allies, and she is forced to take the children, including a baby, on a harrowing journey north to Hamburg. Her parents are Nazis (a fact that she seems too young to fully comprehend), and there is a growing realization of what happened during the war.<br />The novellas remind me of James Joyce's Dubliners in their presentation. Like in Joyce, the characters here come to a realization about life and their place in it, and like in Joyce, they're not happy about the nature of their lives.<br />This is not light reading: it's depressing and often disturbing. If you want a serious and philosophical work that requires some work, then this book is your next choice. It is not, however, summer beach reading. There aren't easy answers here, in fact, there aren't many answers ... just lingering questions.	2002-04-21
US	45698679	R3MC7IG2I6MIPO	0375708707	474326785	Where You Once Belonged	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Simple, direct and interesting	Having previously read Plainsong (as I am sure many who read this novel will have done), I was looking for a similarly enjoyable reading experience. Actually, in some ways, I liked this novel better. As much as I liked Plainsong, I found that there wasn't enough of a focus on a single storyline, and, in the end, I found it a disjointed work. Where You Once Belonged is much more of a traditionally structured novel, and the conflicts are clearer to the reader.<br />Haruf's simple style is both deceptive and hypnotic. I read this book in two sittings, and it was the power of the style that kept me going. The story involves a high school football star who is forgiven many of his character flaws by the town where he lives. After a long absence from the town, he returns, and the novel is the story leading up to that fateful return to town.<br />If you're looking for exactly the same feelings of community and warmth you had at the end of Plainsong, then you will be sorely disappointed by this novel. If, however, you are looking for a more compelling plot with a few more twists, then this novel is for you. I can see why many of Plainsong's fans don't like this one, but I see them as two distinct sides of a very good writer.	2002-04-18

Heck, I'd pay much more for a sporting event or a movie, why should I balk at the price here ... I don't. Besides, I'll pass it on to others to read.<br />To the story: The narrator hears the story of his embarassing father and uncle during the war. He learns that his father is much more than he ever imagined, and it influences his life decisions and his perceptions of people he criticized.<br />I think that most people will perhaps learn a little about criticizing others from reading this. It is hard to understand what other people have been through as we are so focused on our own lives, but it pays to remember that others may have reasons for their actions that we can't imagine. If it helps me to remember this pointed lesson, how can anyone say that this book was not well worth the price.	2002-04-12

It is a nice historical mystery, but it is not in the league of The Alienist, a work to which it is often compared. The narrator, Tom Redmond, is a likeable character, but just as he is confused with the many characters in this mystery, so is the reader.<br />The story searches for the Morton Street Slasher, but the reader who wants a plot similar to the Alienist (which follows the trail of the killer) will be disappointed to learn that this book is more about mining and railroad politics than the search for a killer. If you are interested in the backroom politics of San Francisco in the 1870's or really love the wit of Ambrose Bierce, then you'll probably love this book ... if you're like me, and you like Ambrose Bierce's dark humor but could do without the smoke-filled rooms, then you'll just find it an interesting diversion.	2002-04-11
US	45698679	R1PTMI97FN8JXZ	0375724672	96071634	True History of the Kelly Gang: A Novel	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Very good book, but not worthy of the Booker Prize	This book chronicles Ned Kelly, an Austrailian folk hero similar to Billy the Kid or other American Western criminal heroes. It is told in letters to his young daughter, and the details of his life are revealed episodically through packets of letters written at different times in the last couple of years of his life.<br />The characters are very well drawn, and the reader gets to know Kelly's friends (hardly a gang as it's told here), his family, and the racist, money-grubbing, establishment bad guys that ruin his life. Of course, there are many detours along the way, but what it finally becomes is a well-written, human portrait of a misunderstood killer. This will probably make a good shoot-em-up action movie.<br />As entertaining as this book becomes, I found it a bit slow at the start, and also at some points in the middle stages of the narrative. Overall, though, it is worth reading. Having read most of the other books on the Booker Prize short list, however, I'd say this is the weakest of the group ... if you're looking for deep literature, you'd be better off going to Atonement by Ian McEwan. If you're looking for a reasonable adventure story with interesting characters, then The True History of the Kelly Gang will suit you just fine.	2002-04-07

There was a point, as I was reading this novel, where I fully realized what it was that McEwan was doing -- an &quot;aha&quot; moment. It happened for me when Briony receives a letter from a prospective publisher ... McEwan's brilliance as a writer is that he helps me, and other readers, understand the importance of fiction for the writer, and there is no book that does it better than this one. Since I don't want to spoil the realization for those who haven't read it, let me put it this way: if you write, or want to write, fiction, then read this book.<br />As to the story, there is a building menace all through part 1 of the novel, and then each succeeding part adds to the consequences of the first act. Briony's interference in other people's lives causes every other action in the book, and, in a way, this novel reads like a classical tragedy. Except perhaps, that as an audience member myself, I felt exhilarated rather than cathartic at the end.<br />I disagree with those who see this as a departure from McEwan's other work -- I see it as the logical endpoint of it. I'll be very curious to see where he goes next. Another sidenote: As much as I admired The True History of the Kelly Gang, it is a travesty that Atonement did not win the Booker Prize (yes, I liked Seiffert's work, but this is the best of the group).	2002-04-01

I'll start by saying that you need a working knowledge of Greek Mythology and the Iliad to really follow this very dense short book. Given that, it is a beautifully written, creative story that got me to think about fate, choices, and the connections between people and history. This is a book I can picture reading many times, and I expect to give it to others to read.<br />I have to disagree with those who dislike the Keats chapter near the end of the Achilles. While it might seem tangential to some people, I see it as the tie that binds the theme through the ages to today's world ... and Keats is the perfect kindred spirit to Achilles as he faced the same &quot;choice&quot; that Achilles faced. <br />As an English teacher, I enjoyed this work on many levels, and I would love to teach the book (though there are some &quot;adult&quot; elements to it that could make it difficult). If you would like a brief, philosophical, and satisfying reading experience that engenders meditative thought, then this book would be for you. It also spurred me to open my Complete Works of Keats again.	2002-03-05

I don't remember the last time a book made me laugh out loud, but The Eyre Affair is worth the price for just one of its scenes (when Thursday attends the play Richard III). This book includes so many interesting references to other literature and history that even the minor shortcomings (the only developed character is Thursday) don't hurt the final effect.<br />I would also point out that a background in literature will make this book more enjoyable (along with a sense of whimsy).	2002-03-03

Other reviewers have summarized the plot, and the negative reviews generally seem to get hung up on either the pace (not \\"thrillerish\\" enough) or the ending. If you like literate mystery, though perhaps not quite thriller (it's not heavily plotted enough for that), this book will be the kind that you pass on to the like-minded. There are parallels drawn especially to Moby Dick, but also to the works of Conrad, Stevenson, and other Melville sea novels.<br />I finished the book quickly, and I enjoyed the attention to the historical story at the center of the plot. The narrator and point of view, which seems to put others off, make the story more interesting to me (and its accompanying allusion to Melville). I came away from this book promising to re-read Club Dumas and to find Perez-Reverte's other books ... pretty high praise from me.	2002-03-03
