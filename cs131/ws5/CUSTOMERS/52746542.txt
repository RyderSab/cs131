The editor of <BR>  this collection, Gardner Dozois, is one of the most highly <BR>  skilled working today (he also edits the annual collection <BR>  entitled The Years Best Science Fiction). Dozois has a keen <BR>  instinct when it comes to putting together thoughtful and <BR>  varied anthologies. You can't please all of the people all of   the time, but I always   find at<BR>  least a few true gems in each of Dozois's endeavors. Valentines   is composed of ten stories<BR>  that all gain their impetus from the emotion of love. Each plot   weaves imagination and<BR>  emotion into a coherent whole, although some succeed better   than others. <BR>  I particularly enjoyed No Love in all of Dwingeloo, by Tony   Daniel and Chemistry by James<BR>  Patrick Kelly. Other authors include Connie Willis, Robert   Silverberg and Terry Bisson.	2001-09-29

I have read other trivia books and I can say without <BR> hesitation that Mr. Panati produces the best of the genre. <BR> Many trivia books list a dry and uninspired fact sheet. <BR> Panati, however, avoids this common pitfall and instead <BR> entertains us with unusual and well researched trivia about <BR> the history or origin of many everyday items and customs. <BR> His books are formatted into logical chapter groupings <BR> that easily flow from one topic to another. The book <BR> is a pleasure to read and it teaches you in a pain free <BR> style, answering questions that until now you couldn't find <BR> answers for! Panati's words will both enlighten and <BR> enchant you.	2001-09-14

The book contains wonderful pictures otherwise I would give it zero stars. The book has almost no scientific information and is filled with a lot of irrelevant and dull quotes about giraffes (made by historical figures) , along with other cutesy stuff. AND I still have not found a current scientific/field study type book about giraffes!! This book might be good to read to the kids.	2001-03-10

Lucius Shepard writes with such beautiful, unique precision, and expresses himself in such an uncommon and thought provoking manner that I found myself reading many of his sentences over and over just to savor their flavor and texture. His words linger, and his plots won't leave you alone. His uncommon writing gave me an uncommon pleasure-highly recommended.	2000-12-23

This book is a hybrid consisting of science fiction and mystery and both genres suffer. Science fiction readers will find it pedestrian and trite. It will appeal to some mystery readers, however, I am not one of them. The characters were pretty much \\"stock\\" and the writing pretty much bestseller-ish. No surprises here and not much depth or wit either. I prefer Deaver or Daheim, and Kress and Gibson.	2000-09-29

I had already read much of the source information (ie hyena, lion study etc) from previously published books by Kruk et al. and therefore was already  familiar with the scientific method as concerns animal behavioral studies.  The book was absolutely correct in it's assessment of how scientists view  correct animal study data. I do believe, however, that just because  something can't be absolutely quantified, it does not exist. It has always  disturbed me that science and scientists throughout history have for the  most part been inflexible concerning new ideas and protective of the status  quo. Now back to the review..  Essentially I found this book to be necessary but boring because I was  already familiar with much of it's material. It plays the devil's advocate  and does a very good job if you are new to the subject. Read it for balance  and then make up your own mind...	1998-12-26

Dull  characters make for dull books, and strange or not these characters plodded  along on a well worn path, both lifeless and unimaginative(and I mean  that). Strange or diseased is not always that imaginative because it's too  easy. Jackson is always a good writer but she needed something with a bit  more meat on the bone to flourish.	1998-10-24

Everything is glossed over or sanitized except for what the awful intrusive  fans inflict on the poor little darlings.

Ann  Fallon's Ireland, however, is not merely a locale but an atmosphere, a  state of mind. Her characters are so uniquely Irish, so softly alien to  this American reader. Her plots can be (and usually are) rocky and  unforgiving but her people soften and sweeten the harsh realities of  murder. Her books are different, and in this case, that's exactly what  makes them good.	1998-10-23

Nothing as blatant or artificial as King or Koontz et. al. No weird  monsters or supernatural happpenings, just us, a story about average human  beings. Bigotry and ignorance are the evil entities in this novel and they  are embraced and comforted by many of the characters in this book. Damn  scary if you ask me!

This was not a true mystery but instead an excuse to drop  names and take an uncritical look at the movie industry. A book about  today's trashy culture diguised as a mystery can't help but be trashy  itself when it takes no solid veiwpoint about anything.

Mr. Cussler  warns the reader of his embellishments in advance and I'm sure he uses it  to make the stories more interesting, but it is not for me.

I  got a few laughs from Lula but her main character is too incompetent and  inane to be funny. Joan Hesse, Gillian Roberts and Sharon McCrumb are much  funnier and have other delights as well ie. poignant insights, reasoning  ability etc. I might read another one of these if I'm in deperate need of  total fantasy but she is not the best at what she does.

The book reads like an extension of the real man and I could feel his frustration and disappointment as well as his integrity and ideals on every page of the book. This was not meant to be some dry treatise on the fine points of law and indeed it isn't and I for one am glad of it. Darden speaks as an individual, from his viewpoint and he does it in his own unique style. Isn't that what good historical memoirs are about? The legal system and the trial come alive through his eyes and that's what makes this a good book. He gives us one man's honest recollections and opinions, warts and all. He doesn't smooth it over or cover it or himself up. Amidst all the phoniness and empty flash of the 1990's I find that refreshing and more than that, courageous. This review , by the way, was one woman's opinion.	1998-05-10

Now we have funny murders, cat detectives, and women who love their guns best, to amuse us alongside the classic puzzle or even no puzzle at all. Yet hidden deep inside the heart of every well written mystery one thing must remain, suspense. Every good mystery must supply the reader with a question that must be answered. That why or how or who creates the suspense and adrenaline surge that readers seek from a good mystery. Camilla Crespi does not seem to yet understand this basic need. Her latest book &quot; The Trouble with a Bad Fit&quot; is tailored to please  everyone and succeeds in pleasing no one. The only thing she got right was the title. Pale humor, soft characterization, a recipe here and there (because it is so trendy) cannot disguise or distract from the book's basic lack of suspense filled heart. And because the plot seems as unimportant to me as it obviously did to the writer, I will not try to will it back to conciousness here, but will merely leave one final clue: fluff in disguise.	1998-03-22

The book traces the mobster's life from it's sordid, poverty stricken beginnings to his shoddy ignoble end, murdered as he bends over a pot of linguini. Suppossedly narrated by both his godson and his younger brother Chuck, it is full of nods and winks and hints about high echelon murders and unscrupulous politicians. The authors seem reluctant to face the truth and so the book tends to sweep much that might be hard hitting fact under the rug. As it is , much of it seems highly unbelievable because of the books inability to speak frankly to the reader about hard documented facts. After reading the book the only thing I am sure of is that Sam Giancana's lifestory made my skin crawl. How much is truth and how much is fiction we may never really know, but even the haze is an ugly blur. Unfortunately this reader likes her evil clearcut and it's deeds definable, the book promised but never really delivered a verifiable mug shot. It's one offer you can easily refuse.	1997-09-27

She is the golden (or is it silver) west of the '90's. Trailblazing a path that has taken her beyond<br />the trite well paved platitudes of old age, she still rides tall in the saddle. Oliphant's mystery series revolves around Ms.McClintock, and it had better be nimble or it will be left in the dust. While Oliphant plots an early and well thought out murder, Shirley is busy living another day infuriating and amusing herself with other people's stupidity. May she never retire or growup into youthful apathy. An original in fiction, I have a feeling there are many more real Shirleys in them thar hills. The plots are nearly as sound and interesting and fiery as Shirley-you can take her or leave her- I'll take her	1997-04-26

David Gutterson's &quot; Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; is a lonely exception to this modern &quot;rule&quot;. Being neither trendy nor torrid it has been embraced by the reading public because it speaks with the classic voice of truth. His detailed charcoal studies of prejudice stand rudely beside his delicate watercolors of young impossible love, and both are equally beautiful. The author's craftmanship shapes both base metal and gold into a new perspective and this is delightful. Stop and be wise, stop and listen to the wind calling to you from ancient cedars , read this book and learn your own heart	1997-04-26
