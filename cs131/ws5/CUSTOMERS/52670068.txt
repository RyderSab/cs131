I wouldn't, however, make the mistake of saying that it was a masterpiece or even anything near that.  Salter tells the tale of Dr. Michael Stone (for  the first 50 something pages I thought this was a man, it's not!) a  psychologist who's faced with one of her worst enemies, child molester Alex  Willy, being released from prison and beginning to stalk her.  Though the  novel never lives up to its potential and Dr. Stone has some annoying  quirks (a love of b-ball, her term for basketball being not the least of  these) it's still a fun summer read.	1999-08-17

Powerful narratives from those who survived slavery detailing their struggles as slaves, struggles for freedom, and beginnings of establishing new lives.

Otherwise, trust me, I wouldn't have gotten through this entire mess.  The authors have about three common sense points to make and take about 100 pages to  make each of those points.

I found it totally confusing that Reed constantly changes point of view and location.  Worse than confusing, however, is that in doing this we don't care about any of the characters.   Even when they die I'm not inspired to shed a tear.  Reed wants to be the  African American Kurt Vonnegut, but I'm sorry to say that this effort falls  far short of that mark.	1999-08-16

Here we meet a child who is so tired of seeing blond haired blue eyed white children in the spotlight that she gleefully dismembers her white baby dolls and dreams of doing the same thing to the white children she meets.  Claudia befriends Pecola who's dream is to be blue eyed for then this girl, tormented for her ugliness, will be beautiful.  Pecola has problems of her own. ...Her biggest problem arrises when a new age spiritualist tells her that her wish has been granted and Pecola chooses to believe it, totally disconnecting herself from reality.  The only faults in this tale arise in Morrison's changing characters so often that it sometimes becomes confusing as to whose head we are inside.	1999-08-16

Hurston chooses to go with the local color and let the characters in this story speak as they actually would have for the time and location.  It took awhile for me to  learn to decipher this language.  Once I got beyond that I found a touching  love story develope between socially prominent Janie and a lower class Tea  Cake.  Janie has never felt love before (her grandmother married her off at  age 15 to ensure that she was taken care of) and goes against her friend's  advisements in running off with Tea Cake.  Their love and marriage endure  many hard ships, but tragedy waits just around the corner.  Soapy, but one  of the few African American romances I've read that rings true.	1999-08-16

I was hooked by the end of the first chapter.  This book follows the lives of young brothers, Pharaoh and Lafayette.  As the book moves on you get to know the boys and their families better than you would've liked.  I say  this because of the horrors the children are forced to endure merely  because they were born into poverty.  Shootings, arrests, drugs, gangs, and  unimaginable living conditions are the norm.  This book made me greatful  that I live where I do, but at the same time enhanced my world view and  made me want to change things.  If only everyone felt that way, maybe no  more children would be forced to live lives such as these boys do.  Anyone  know what happened to them?	1999-08-03

I think everyone remembers hearing about little Nicholas, only seven years old, killed by highway robbers in Italy.  His family donated his organs and started a rash of others doing to in Europe and throughout the world.  This is his story as told by his father.  The wonderful effect of that act made me want to give the book a better review.  The father's attitude made me want to give it a worse one, so it's right in the middle.  Maybe I would feel differently had I not read this book directly following John Walsh's book.  Walsh seemed like an ordinary man doing his best to cope with extraordinary circumstances. Green seems like a man who's enjoying all of the attention.  His writing style isn't great either.  He flitters around topics in a disjointed manner and goes about his mind's own ethical ramblings far to often.	1999-08-03

There's really not much value to it, but it sure does taste good!  The story is one that you won't want to put down, a noble (good to the core)  executive rescues a kidnapped abused little girl and sets out to return her  to her family.  I kept wondering why he didn't call the cops instead and  his excuse (that she would probably be put in foster care for awhile)  didn't totally fly with me, but I went with it.  Along the way they are  pursued by the head of a child selling ring who's armed and dangerous.  The  unthinkable keeps happening and if you stop to think about it you'll laugh  because everything that can go wrong for this guy does, but it's darn  interesting and a quick ride!	1999-08-03

What could have been just another child in jeapordy retread becomes one of the best psychological thrillers I have read.  This book tells the story of David, a young boy living with his newly divorced mother and younger  brother.  After a fight with his mother, David runs away and vanishes.  The  cops are slow to react thinking that he ran away or was stolen by his  father (who's on vacation).  His mother however senses that something is  wrong.  Indeed it is, we see things from David's point of view as he is  held captive by the unbalanced Denver.  David is painted realistically as a  child who first finds all of the attention and gifts bestowed upon him by  his new friend as a treat.  Slowly, however, Denver's dangerous side  emerges and we come to feel David's deep terror. All of the characters  appear three dimensional and ring true.  The mother's devotion to her  children, jealousy of her ex's new girlfriend, and anger at David for  disobeying are all realistic.  The father is seen as getting a new lease on  life from his young girlfriend.  The girlfriend shows that she's more than  just a bimbo when she uses the Internet to help locate David.  Even the  kidnapper is given a past, feelings, and reasons (however twisted) for what  he's done.  Superb first novel.  Can't wait to read more by this author!	1999-08-03

I heard bits and pieces about the case while growing up, mostly from my parents and parents of other children who  suddenly took kidnapping a little bit more seriously.  I wanted to learn  more about the case and read this book.  I was moved to tears more than  once reading about this family's struggle, perserverance, and triumph.

An educated family are returning home from a concert when, while stopped at a rest area, their son is killed in a hit and run.  Driver of  the car is a divorced dad just getting his life back together.  His own son  is asleep in the car.  The author switches from chapter to chapter who the  narrator is (between the boy's mother, father, and the driver of the car)  and does so with unparalleled skill.  Usually this tactic annoys me, but  here it works well.  We get to see how the death affects all involved, as  well as the relationships in the family and beyond.  Tension mounts as the  case goes unsolved with the police.  Finally Dad takes matters into his own  hands.  He discovers who did it too, but here's where everything falls  apart.  Schwartz, for all of his skill until this point, just doesn't know  how to end the book and the way he ends up going with is wholly  unsatisfying.	1999-05-30

After a bus accident kills several children in a small town, everyone needs someone to blame.  Russell Banks tells this story well by focussing on only a few characters and letting us get into their heads by way of  switching narrators, among whom are parents of the dead children, a  teenager who survived the accident, the bus driver, and a lawyer in town to  get rich off of the accident.  Banks is unwavering in his portrayal of  immense grief and you feel by the end as though you personally know the  characters.

This book takes you inside the world of foster care, a place that, you find out quickly isn't somewhere you want to be.  The voices of the children themselves tell the stories in this collection of essays.  We see  things as they actually are: siblings are split up and sometimes never  reunited, children's loyalties between abusive or neglectful parents and  the &quot;system&quot; are questioned, kids age out of the system and are  left to a world they know nothing about without a family to guide them.  It  is all here.  It is all true.  I challenge you to read it and not have it  make you think long and hard about the way &quot;the system&quot; works and  how it affects the kids.	1999-05-30

It amazes me that a book can have a storyline such as this one (mad man kidnaps a bus full of handicapped children and begins killing them off) and be so NOT moving.  For starters, Fox chooses to rely on a couple of cheap  cliches to drive his story.  First off, the main plot centers not on the  children, but on the cop trying to solve the case.  Cliche number one: this  cop is a woman.  Cliche number two: this cop is also a mother.  Cliche  number three: woman cop was abused by ex-husband and is now dating chief of  police.  Cliche number four:  FBI big men come in (behaving stereotypically  as if they believe themselves to be better then the cops) and cheesy  romance between woman cop and FBI G-man develops.  This lame main storyline  is surprising considering that Fox has obviously done his research when it  comes to the kidnapper's pathology.  He is a unique character who destroys  all preconceived ideas about him along the way.  Bottom line, not enough  time was spent on developing the characters of the children or their bus  driver, kidnapped along with them (most of the kids don't even get names)  to care other than in the most detached way, when the kidnapper starts  killing them.  Woman cop was too cliche for me to care.  Thus, I read the  whole book which granted was suspenseful enough not to want to put down,  without really caring about anyone in it at all.	1999-05-30

I read this book for a course on HIV.  It was the only one that I could find that gave a clinical look at the unique effects a partner's death can have on the homosexual community.  This surprised me since AIDS has taken  an especially large toll on the gay population.  The author teaches us  unique aspects of grieving given the circumstances that many people don't  view the death of a partner to be the same as the death of a spouse.  Also  delves into the fact that the relationship may not have been something  others were aware of or agreed with.  All in all this is an educational and  moving book.  Anyone interested in (or already working in) the social  services field should read it.	1999-05-30

Sure, she had a few good books (Fine Things and Star), but most of her stuff just seems to recycle the same plot until it's been beat into the ground so deep we don't want to hear it again.   Vanished is different.  I read it only after watching the movie and  thinking that this didn't sound like Steel to me.  I wasn't disappointed.   The story of a young boy's kidnapping in the early 1900s is affecting.  His  mother feels responsible for the death of a different son from a different  marriage in a drowning accident years before.  It so happens that the first  son's father is in town at the time of the kidnapping and ends up getting  blamed for young Teddy's disappearance.  Marielle sides with her ex, but as  the evidence mounts, finds herself wavering.  In the meantime her marriage  to Malcolm is falling apart and she is beginning to question his honesty as  well.  No, this is not a romance novel and a reader would be hard pressed  to find a Steel love scene anywhere in this book.  What it is, however, is  a surprisingly well crafted novel of suspense.	1999-05-30
