US	52398946	RAJ8RD3PESITI	0262134322	859524944	Software Ecosystem: Understanding an Indispensable Technology and Industry (MIT Press)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Insightful, highly recommended	At the *intersection* of software and business, and the business of software. The authors draw on research in economics, IT, and strategy and bring them together to draw excellent insights at their intersection. The book is not really about business or software per se.     Depending on your background, you might want to skip entire sections that are right up your own alley. If you are a manager looking to REALLY understand how the architecture of IT systems (e.g., at the enterprise level) interacts with business strategy, this book will provide a good exposure. If you are a propellerhead or uber-geek wanting to understand more about how your work shapes, hinders, or facilitates business strategy, this book is just right. I keep up with new research developments in the business of software and feel comfortable saying that the insights in this book are not to be found in other books that exist on the market.     The book is very well written, but be forewarned, it is deep. Fully appreciating it requires thought, reflection on what the authors are saying, and a tempered pace. It is not a quick read and not a \\"how-to\\" book. My only quibble with this book has nothing to do with its content: Once you get rid of the dust jacket, the quality of its binding and cover printing is absolutely shoddy. Very highly recommended and worth every penny of the forty dollar price.       Three year (June 2008) update on my 2005 review: Nothing yet comes close to the wide array of thought provoking questions that this book raises. I'm wildly speculating here, but the fact that one of the coauthors is an electrical engineer rather than a software developer is perhaps the reason why the nature of this book is so refreshing and original. Sometimes, it takes an outsider without the baggage of insider assumptions to bring a fresh perspective. At the new paperback price, it's better than a red-tagged bargain that you'd find at the aisle end caps of Target!	2005-02-03
US	52398946	RG6OZ22DD0WAE	0761927425	793860973	Interaction Effects in Multiple Regression (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)	Books	5	30	30	N	Y	Excellent overview of interactions in regression (updated 2009, 2010, 2013)	This is a very nice updated version of the original edition. The book is short at 89 pages, information packed, and solidly grounded. The book is meant for people who *use* interaction effects in thier research. (It is not meant for people who study regression methods.)<br /><br /> STRONG POINTS: It references the key developments in the methodological literature, the most significant of which appeared in Psychological Bulletin. It even discusses in layman terms Chronbach's (of the Chronbach Alpha fame) recent paper in Psyc Bulletin on errors in interactions.<br /><br /> SCOPE: The book covers two-way and three-way interactions. It offers a digestable discussion of variable transformations. The authors clarify two of the biggest misperceptions about testing interactions: (1) It is incorrect to interpret the main effects in the presence of interaction terms and (2) Multicollinearity is rarely a problem with interaction terms if you appropriately transform the variables.<br /><br /> WHAT THE BOOK DOES NOT COVER: The book does not discuss (1) mediation testing and (2) is missing a key reference on that topic. If you're reading this, it will probably be helpful! [1] R. Baron and D. Kenny, \\"The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research: Conceptual, Strategic, and Statistical Considerations,\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 1986, 1173-1182.<br /><br />Overall, the book is very well written, readable, and usable in doing interaction analyses. It is meant for the consumer not the producer of statistical methods. SPSS exemplars and detailed interpretations really help clarify the points. For fifteen bucks, this is worth owning, dog-earing, and highlighting. Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Feb 2009 follow-up to my 2004 review:<br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />The first author of the book has also developed a software tool that adds a lot of the functionality discussed in this book to SPSS. SPSS requiresseveral manual steps including centering to do interactions. (Search for Zumastat using your usual search engine.) Be warned that such convenience does not come cheap! It it a two hundred dollar software add-on but it works very well. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />August 2010 update - Discussion on hierarchically well-formulated models:<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This book also directly addresses the question of what product terms need to be included if only a few possible interactions are theoretically hypothesized. The jury is divided, with one camp arguing that only the hypothesized terms need inclusion, and the other camp arguing that all possible product terms (for that order) must be included. This book is in the second camp, where the authors lay out the rationale for formulating what they call a hierarchically well formulated (HWF) model.<br /><br />If you're reading this, the discussion appears on page 65. (I have trudged through Aiken and West but have not found an explicit discussion of this issue there.)<br /><br />May 2013 Update - Combining Mediation and Moderation in the same Model<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Another new green Sage paperback that explicitly discussed some mediated-moderation and moderated-mediation ideas has appeared in print (Mediation Analysis by Dawn Iacobucci). I've found it to be a nice complement to this book. (A no-referral link appears below.)<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Mediation-Analysis-Quantitative-Applications-Sciences/dp/141292569X	2004-12-05

They offer a nice review of research in economics research journals such as American Economic Review. The first is Chapter 5 on \\"Specialization\\", which discusses the economic side of specialization by outsourcing. It makes a compelling argument for both how outsourcing facilitates deeper specialization and the risks that are inherent in treading this path. The second worthy chapter is Chapter 7 on \\"Control and Flexiblity.\\" This chapter reviews how outsourced activities ought to be controlled, how contracts ought to be structured, and the residual rights that often cause problems. A note of caution for non-academic readers: This is a research-focused book and not (in my opinion) intended for a general audience. The tone is very academic, so don't expect to see a Harvard Business Review style light reading here! The writing style is more like Management Science than American Economic Review. Browse at your local Borders before you buy. There are some insightful nuggets in this nice and concisely-written book. Recommended.	2004-11-17

I've had my Ph.D. for several years now and own all of the usual stuff like the Hair book, the array of SPSS manuals, and the Tabachnik and Fidell book. Of all the books and books I've used,read, and owned this is the singly most user friendly book on the topic. If you use SPSS in your work, I promise that this will be the best forty dollars you can spend. I wish more stats books were written in this tone. The book is actually fun to read, which is the highest compliment that a stats book can get. It is also very accurate. The single downside of this book is that it lacks references to research on which its recommendations are based. This book might be too weak for statisticians but it is just perfect for those who use statistical methods, especially SPSS.  Very highly recommended.	2004-11-02

Browse through it in your local library before you buy a copy. Highly recommended.<br /><br />May 2013 Update:<br />---------------<br />Chapter 5 has a concise step-by-step summary of the entire scale development process. This is a very applied book and not intended for readers more interested in psychometric theory that its application. I'd still recommend this book over any competing title. If you got a cheaper copy on an older edition of this book, you'd not be missing anything critical.	2004-10-03

There are no answers to be found, only a compass to finding the answers that are right for your company. It goes to the heart of the painful question of what part of the corporate IT function should be handed to the corporate geeks and to the bean counters in accounting. The book expands on an article in Harvard Business Review by the same authors. The book is well written, although overly droning and long in some parts. Overall, it is one of the most original and understandable discussions of the topic. Highly recommended if your interest is in controlling IT expenditures without losing sight of the strategic opportunities that it offers. Buy--don't borrow--a copy. You'll want to dogear some pages that alone justify the thirty dollar price tag.      2015 update to my 2004 review:  -----------------------------  Over ten years later, this book is still unsurpassed in terms of the relevance and depth of coverage. Many IT fads have come and gone (think SOA, Green IT) and the field has had nice new advances (cloud computing, apps, ecosystems). Yet the topics in this book are enduring. The most original aspects in this book, in retrospect, are: (a) the whole discussion about decision rights, (b) centralization versus decentralization of IT, and (c) the discussion of how IT infrastructure and apps must be tackled separately but must also cohere. The second author also published an article in HBR (\\"Six IT decisions IT should not make\\") that is a nice complement to this book. I still highly recommend this book.	2004-09-25

This book develops the idea that the problem with the way we develop systems, software, and apps is that we think of software as a product. The author argues that that's part of what gets us into trouble. Think of the very-public software failures that led to massive business failures (and billions of dollars down the tubes): Denver Airport, London's TAURUS stock exchange, and the CONFIRM airline reservation project (forget the dot coms for now). This book proposes an alternative idea: Software must be thought of as a medium for storing knowledge. If you fail to embed the relevant and oft dispersed knowledge in a software application, that is the making of a fialure. The author then draws comelling linkages between this idea and the role f software processes, methodologies, and the norms that dominate the industry. The book is written in a very coherent way and unlike most technology books. It's actually fun to read. Think of it as the next delightful book to appear after Hal Varian's 1999 bestseller \\"Information Rules.\\" The ideas that the author develops appeared in thier preliminary form in several columns in Communications of the ACM. Here, those ideas are extnesively developed. The sixty dollar price tag might dissuade some, but a quick scan in the library is going to be sufficient to convince anyone interested in software development and IT management about the value of giving this book a permanent spot on thier bookshelf. Strongly recommended. Must have.	2004-01-17

The book proposes a dynamic resource model for e-business. In my reading of this book, that model itself makes this book worth the price. It is one of the most articulate analytical tools. Once you think about all of the dot coms we saw come and go in the past five years through this book's lens, it all comes together. I used this as the basis for one of my business school courses and was pleasantly surprised how well my students could relate to the concepts and ideas discussed here. The author deserves much credit for clean and cohesive writing. The book is short and an easy read. But do not letthe size fool you: there is much substance and timelessness in the book. Chapter 3 was my favorite part. It is not based on the &quot;flavor of the month.&quot; Rather it can be compared to Shapiro and Varian's Information Rules in terms of its looooong shelf life and fad-free nature. Although the book has e-commerce in its title, it is more about e-business. After you're done readintg the book, the Dynamic Resource Model is worth photocopying and framing (really!). Highly recommended.	2003-04-28

Nothing particularly earth shattering that I walked away with afterI plonked down my thirty bucks for this book. The authors make a keen attempt to differentiate Web services from ASPs...a technology that never quite lived up to its hype. Their arguments about the fundamental aspects of why Web services will change the world are unconvincing. However, there are a few gems to walk away with. First, the notion of modular architectures, and thier impact on organizational flexibility. Second, the importance of standards around the Web that compenstate for the lack of standards in across-firm infrastructures. I guess this is a moderate buy, provided you do not go in expecting to see Hagel in his full force (remember his earlier books were quite phenomenal in this regard). For the readers of HBR, you will find the essence of this book distilled in two recent articles by Hagel. As a side note, Seely Brown is listed as the coauthor: this is misleading because he only wrote the preface.	2002-11-30

The writing style is lucid and the discussion of KM technolgy (2 chapters) is commendable. Just a few phrases and metaphors that is uses in the book make it a worthy read. Definitely worth the money.

Although Teece is unsure in his preface whoether is succesfully addresses both academic audiences and managers. From an academic perspective, I can surely claim that this book is theoretically interesting. I recognized two portions of this book that draw heavily on Teece's work published previously in California Management Review (parts of Chapter 1 and all of chapter 4). What is certainly most interesting out of the 300 pages of small type is Section 2. This section provides a compelling set of arguments on the impact of market structures and governance modes on intellectual capital. Notabily missing, however, is incorporation of the knowledge-integration perspective that Grant et. al have been building for the past half decade. The case study on Pilkinton Glass is also well worn, and Teece clearly acknowledges that. Information technologists should not hold thier breath because this work seems to take a rather passive stand on the role of IT in mobilizing intellectual assets. The references at the end provide an impressive array of literature in economics that Teece draws on. The readibility and plausibility of Teece's arguments should come as no surprise to anyone who has read Teece's earlier scholarly work. Overall, I'd say that this was worth the thirty five dollars.	2001-05-25

This edition is sufficiently revised to justify its price, and the binding is good enough not to justify the hardback version.

Max Boisot has been talking about it for years, and Christensen at HBS has also been building a research stream on it. However, this book is more readable, and more grounded in current business settings than the aforementioned.

The author explains the concepts in a very understandable manner. Although I bought this book two years back, I still refer back to it occasionally. I would highly recommend this to someone who is just starting out with SEM. But more advanced users will be a little disappointed because it stops at the basics. Two notes of warning are in order: (1) this book does NOT discuss the visual interface that LISREL now has, and (2) SPSS now supports AMOS and has dropped LISREL support.	2001-05-15

VERY Highly recommended	An excellent book is one that makes you think, wonder, and question your assumptions. This is precisely that book when it comes to E-business. This book's focus on strategy AND technology makes it stand out of the crowd. It was in this author's work in 1995 that we first began to hear about electronic commerce. This pioneering, insighful, and forward thinking characteristic is clarly visible in this revision. Although I owned the previous edition, the additions since the last edition made it a worthy acquisition for my personal collection. The power to think beyond the immediate---an obsession that led to the burst of the dot-com bubble--is emphasized here. In applying the author's frameworks, the collaboration between Napster and Batrlesmaan was quite predictable. The chapter on trading digital goods alone is worth the price of this book. This book takes a remarkably cautionary approach that suggests that strategies of &quot;examples&quot; are still examples, not strategies by themselves. Don Tapscott emphasizes this in the introduction to this book. This book helps you think in terms of carving your own roadmap. Having built your own roadmap translates to the inability of competitors to &quot;copy&quot; your approach. This is certainly a book that is ahead of our times, and worth every penny of the 30ish bucks that is costs. Everytime I read a certain section, I can immediately relate to the latest issue of Business Week and its e-biz sectioin reports on terrible failures and envied successes. Read it, reread it, dog ear it, and put it under your pillow for a goodnight's sleep.  Very, very, very highly recommended.	2001-04-13

While there is nothing wrong with that, and it might be of value to people who are *really* new to computers....folks who've been using PCs or Macs (esp.

I borrowed a copy at my library. Once I started reading it, I realized that this actually belonged to an serious business reader's bookshelf. I went out and bought a copy. There are several features that make this book a must-have: 1. The author's tlk about decision making under high pressure 2. Time, as in real life, is at premium 3. There is often little opportunity to do detailed analysis as our graduate school textbooks showed us. 4. There is a lot more to decisions than rational choice models.<br />This book takes all this into account. The authors present a coherent argument. The book's logical organization makes thier points easy to grasp. This book will be of value to both managers and researchers. Unlike many other books on decison making, this one is based on rigirous research spannig many years---not one guy's opinions. Buy it, highlight it, dog-ear it, and absorb it. Sources of Power is truly an excellent source of power about a new, integrative way of thinking. EXCELLENT READ.	2001-04-13

This book is an ecellent discussion of the &quot;renewal paradox.&quot; ...how stable companies try to integrate unstable project teams in thier fold and try to make both work. The choice, the authors argue, is not one or the other ---but both together. This work is very well articulated and provides excellent fodder for thought to researchers and managers alike. Although this book is authored by four collaborators, not once did I feel that in reading it. Although many references are in Swedish, there are still many gems of literature that the authors provide pointers to. Very highly recommneded.	2001-04-08

He builds further on his pieces in SMJ (with Singh from Wharton) and AMR and illustrates the concepts of relationship-based assets in firm networks. The running exemplar has he uses (Toyota) illustrates his theoretical arguments quite elonquently. The book also highlights the limitations of his concept of collaborative advantage, and his closing chapter illustrates how cultural differences (here with Benz) can keep this strategy from becoming reality. This book is not for folks looking for cut-out recipies. This book is a MUST for researchers and managers who like to think instead of searching for cookbooks! The concluding chapter is a gem because it highlights our gaps in knowledge. This is an excellent book, and having read Dyer's other works, it's high quality comes as very little surprise.

The key lesson that  I took away from this book was that the Silver Bullet for e-Business  success lies in the journey--the process--and those who recognize that can  build thier own inimitable silver bullets.<br />This book is not for those  looking for a &quot;formula&quot; or Silver Bullet for e-commerce success.  It is for those who realize that the quest for Silver Bullet-like formulas  is for those who seek to imitate, not innovate. If anything,  once-successful B2C businesses that have been closing down since this past  Christmas season should teach us a lesson that little is gained from  imitation. Process excellence is what differentiates in the end, and that  needs deep understanding of your own business models, and knowledge of your  markets. Although the authors do not directly refer to it, the role of  knowledge management surfaces implicitly throughout thier discussion  (&quot;first learner advantage&quot;). While the authors dicuss e-commerce,  much of what this book has to offer is also applicable to e-Business.  <br />This is the kind of business book that comes once every few years, and  the one that's best bought in hardcover because of the extent to which I'll  probably refer to it. This book is not meant to provide you the right  answers, but it will help you ask the right questions. The beauty of this  volume is that it describes fundamental, timeless concepts that will remain  the same even when the next wave of technology emerges. In my opinion, a  few comparative tables and the discussion of Schwab and FedEx alone are  worth the cost of this book.<br />Very highly recommended.	2000-07-22

The author's of this book are leading thinkers in the KM field. Perhaps the best way to describe this book is as a sequel to Nonaka's earlier 1995 book. But, we all remember what happened to Scarlett,  again a much touted  sequel. Although this book was a slight disappointment since Nonaka has set  reader's expectations a little too high with his earlier groundbreaking  title &quot;The Knowledge Creating ompany&quot; that, for the most part,  defined KM as we know it. An academic reader will appreciate they  theoretical insights provided and extensive references to supporting  literature. But there are some aspects that this book underplays: 1.  Knowledge creation is fine, but knowledge integration is perhaps as  important---an issue to which the authors pay little attention. 2.  Excellent ideas aside, this book underplays the significance of empirical  evidence and most cases tend to be descriptive qualitative analyses. 3. The  role of technology is highly underplayed.  4. The book has  &quot;sufficient&quot; overlap with the authors' research papers in the  uropean Management Journal. For academic readers who have read those, this  might be a little disappointing. 5. The concept of KM and it's relationship  with innovation at architectural and component levels is not described in  much detail.<br />On the positive side, you will find that: 1) Lots of issues  that were barely touched upon  in Nonaka's preceding book are described in  further detail. 2) The book is very well written and the tone is accsible  to both academic and non-academic readers. 3) the concept of BA is  elucidated in further detail Readers who do not follow academic research  journals might find that an interesting extension. 4) A link between  strategy and KM is well illustrated. For businesses, KM is of little value  if there are no results. The authors describe how to look for those results  (or in lay terms, ROI). Academic readers will also find Nonaka's recent  paper in a recent issue of Organization Science (2000) to be of much  interest. Academic readers must also realize that the approach here seems  to be &quot;post modern,&quot; and indeed quite qualitative in the European  research tradition. <br />To sum my opinion, this book is a worthy addition to  the bookshelves; but, it is not to be read without reading Nonaka's  preceding book &quot;The Knowledge Creating Company.&quot; A word of  warning is in order: Academic readers will enjoy this title however,  managerial readers might find it a little heavy and abstract. Indeed, this  book stands out of the crowd with three authors who are well respected in  the American research circles---consequently, its high overall quality  comes as no surprise. Recommended.	2000-05-30

So, after being a PC user beginning with Dos 1.0, I switched  to a Mac. I hated my first iMac because it lacked documentation, manuals,  or decent help. And, being a long standing Windows user, I did not find it  as intuitive as it was hyped to be. Guess what, I got frustrated and sold  it on the big e*bay auction site. Months passed, Y2K came and went.<br />A few  days back I saw this book in my local Borders...and it all came together!  THIS was what was truly missing!  I had hated most Mac OS books on the  market because I found them insultingly oversimplified. I can only speak as  a Windows convert: This is not a &quot;dummies&quot; book but a very  decent, detailed book that describes all the &quot;power tricks&quot; that  I knew for the enemy platform! I liked this book so much that I bought it,  read it cover to cover, and decided to buy my second iMac. If you've never  used a computer before, then this is not for you. But if you are looking  for a book that is perhaps the most detailed, information-dense, well  indexed, and handy reference to MacOS 9, this is it. Apple should probably  bundle this book with the Mac! Highly, heartily, and strongly recommended,  especially for those who have fallen from the Windows empire for the  temptation of an iMac.	2000-05-06

This is an excellent book for the beginner. The concepts are explained in way that is  hard to forget. This reminds me of David Pogue's books: Accurate, yet  enjoyable. This is not a book for the hard nosed Java programmer, but  definitely worth a read for someone who is starting out with Java. Concepts  are explained very accurately, and this is far removed from the 600-page  tomes in the sense that this is safer: It's not heavy enough to smash your  PC screen when you cant get that dang program to work! Interestingly  enough, someone with little programming experience can also get the jokes.  And for the other reviewers who take programming a little too seriously to  be fun: Get a life! Also make sure you visit the author's (or publisher's?)  home page at mrbunny.com. Highly and heartily recommended.	2000-04-28

This might not be for the spanking rich traveling with an unlimited  budget, but for a budget minded traveler like me, I found the tips  indispensable. The book is well bound, and like some other books that  I clowsely examined, this one did not *seem* like it would fall apart  into three unasked for sections in the middle of my trip. A nice map  at the end is an added bonus.  For little more than ten bucks, I  found this hard to beat. If you only wanrt to carry one guide with  you, and like me, you're a first time traveler to France, this should  probably be the one. Excellent and highly recommended.  END	2000-03-31

Lucky me! This turned out to be the best ten bucks invested in my trip to Hawaii. This book is small enough to carry in your pocket, yet is chock full of  detail. I was impressed when I took a trip to the southern edge of Maui  solely relying on this book. Every shop, corner, and area of Maui matches  the description in this book. It is very accurate and upto date. The tips  included by the authors were very helpful. When we wanted to mail coconuts  from Maui and were really lost, this book helped. A few hints for Maui  travelers: some USPS offices in Maui have officers dressed in Hawaiian  attire, so do not be confused and doubt if it really is a post office guy  when you see him dressed like a Hawaiian beach bum! If you go to the  southern edge of the island, you can actually buy coconuts at the post  office and mail 'em too. Permanent markers that you use to address coconuts  are awfully hard to find, so pack a Sharpie with your stuff! Overall, if  there is just one travel guide you'd buy, pick this one. The book's binding  is very good, and it held up after all the beating around and abuse that  was showered on my copy. Don't let the small size fool you--this one is  very detailed, and more importantly, very accurate (verified by us in Jan  2000). Highly recommended.	2000-03-28

The title should have served as a warning for my credit card. This book probably has all academic qualities, but little call or guidance for action. Stick to  Davenport and Prusak's &quot;Working Knowledge&quot; book on KM for that  and save your money on this one--there is nothing new for managers. A table  in chapter 8 (and continued in 9) are good overall summaries that still do  not make this book worth the cover price. Thumbs down to another ivory  tower production.	2000-03-23

The book itself gets the credit for being the first to address the important but oft-ignored issue of trust in electronic commerce and e-business relationships.  However, I found that the depth of discussion in this book was lacking (1)  detail and (2) failed to provide any guidelines for how, as a manager, I  could establish such &quot;realtionships of trust&quot; in my own company.  The book does read like four different people wrote it and does not flow.  There are some interesting ideas and examples, but I'd suggest you borrow  it from the library first. Above average and recommended with slight  reservations.	2000-03-21

After browsing the Web for many, many, many hours finding this book was a pleasant surprise. The key strength of this book is that it does not drag on a lengthy discussion on  finding sources of funding for a long time---many of us in Academia already  know who we expect to get funded through! If what you're looking for is  detailed guidance on actually shaping the research grant proposal  (something I'd never done before), look no further. This book is very well  written, to the point, and exemplifies good, concise writing. highly  recommended!	2000-03-18

At that time it shaped many of the newer ideas that have given us the &quot;New Economy&quot; today. Like the  author's new book &quot;e-Business,&quot; this book was THE defenitive  guide in its heyday. I used it in a graduate level electronic commerce  course in my school and still have it on my shelf--with a protective  plastic cover on it! This is not a quick read but a long-term keeper.  Strongly recommended.	2000-03-10

The author offers many insights into the little known facets of  Silicon Valley--many are amusing at best and many are just plain  unexpected. A must read. I'd say it's worth the discounted dollars.	2000-03-09

This book is a MUST READ. Unlike many business books in which ideas come out of thin air, this one is grounded in rock solid research. If you get this book, make sure you also read the author's article in the March 2000  Harvard Business Review. Key Lesson of this book: The most unexpected  sources of trouble a perfect customer centric company are precisely those  customer-centric mentalities. Every page of this book is worth the twenty  something dollars. If you miss reading this one, you are missing out on  some of the fundamental ideas that will shape the new economy. Beg, borrow  (from your library), or steal...but do read this one! The last few pages  are however filled with numerous statistics that do not necessarily fit in  a more practioner oriented book like this.	2000-03-09

This book is one of those business classics that comes along once every five years. Unlike hyped  marketers with ideas but no evidence, this book is grounded in solid  research. If you read this one, make sure you also read the authors'  article in the November 1998 Harvard Business Review. The book is highly  original, fresh, and very very readable. In conclusion, this book is worth  *every* penny.	2000-03-09

I think that the author has used good judgement in balancing depth of coverage and breadth of topics. I would  strongly recommend it...surely worth the money. Competing titles that I've  seen are not meant for the newbie, and many such as Newton's are good but  do not solely focus on the wireless aspect of things. I would hope that the  author will bring in more coverage of WAP-like protocols and wireless PDA  technologies like the ones used---unsuccesfully or succesfully---in the new  Palm devices.

A nice addition to your book shelf,  but surely not the first eBay book you should buy. Information about the  official stuff, however, is undeniably comprehensive.	1999-12-09
