In addition to the important information about academics and safety and security, these facts make you feel like you're talking to a student rather than reading some bland description in a large review book on hundreds of colleges. Like, who would have thought that in 1895 marshmallows were first mass-produced in Rochester. But in all seriousness, this is a great book that really has excellent information about the school and everyone looking at University of Rochester should check it out.	2005-05-16

But now that I've read all about the academic culture and culture surrounding campus, I have seen inside the world more than I would have if I'd just gone on a campus tour. The student perspective makes it all the better because it's not propagandistic, since they show all sides. It's a great way to learn about a school you know nothing about, or even if you're an incoming freshman I imagine it would be useful to read about campus housing, parking, and off-campus dining.	2005-05-16

It will give you information unlike any other review book out there because it's written by students at the school and contains only things current students know about. No large review book is going to give you information about guys and girls, or off campus housing. In addition to these things of course there are sections on academics and facilities alike as well as a ton of other things. Get this book, and you won't be disappointed.	2005-05-16

Not knowing Pittsburgh at all, or the University of Pittsburgh, I feel that after reading this guide I have a much more detailed impression of both. That's what is so great about this book, you don't jsut get wonderful info about the school and its academics/athletics.diversity, etc, but also about the area in which the school is located.

This book is so great because it showed me what the school is like better than my campus visit did. I got the lowdown on academics, safety and security, and even on nightlife. I think even current students should pick this up (perhaps freshman moreso than upperclassmen) because it has info on restaurants and off-campus housing, etc. that is helpful to all.	2005-05-16

After reading this book however, I really got a much better look into the goings on not only of the institution but also of the surrounding area. I love the fact that this book was written by a student and that there are student quotes throughout. No other guides that I've seen have sections on diversity or how to find help getting a job or internship, so these elements made me feel like I was having an in depth discussion with faculty and students at the school (that's how well informed the writer was).	2005-05-16

Reading this book is like having a nice long conversation with a current student about their college. They give you intimate details that other guides won't tell you and you know you're getting accurate information because there are both pro and con oriented quotes about every aspect reviewed, and they come direct from anonymous students. I really found the \\"Finding a Job or Internship\\" section helpful because its' good to know that the college has such great resources to help me when I need to find summer/post-college work.	2005-05-16

I know next to nothing about Eugene, Oregon and now I feel I know it a bit better. The sections on Campus housing and dining were great as were the academics section of course. I was pleasantly suprised to find that there were sections on guys and girls, diversity, and athletics in addition to all of the more academic sections. All aspects of a school are important so it was good to get a better feel for the culture and this bok really helped with that.	2005-05-16

I also liked the details, for example, the cost of a meal plan and where I could use my plan, or where the best places to live are, and how good campus security is. All of these elements made the book well worth the purchase! I think even new students would get a lot out of it.	2005-05-16

I mean, really, who tells you about the Nightlife scene or Guys and Girls?! Of course all the relevant academic and financial information is included up to the minute detail which is great in it of itself, but I enjoyed reading the fun facts that make Williams unique. Those are the things that really drew me in and told me more than anything else I've read about Williams. Buy this book!	2005-05-13

I just read this book and I am very impressed with the way it was put together and the information it contains. I've been looking for information on Xavier and this is the first book that I felt really gave the \\"insider's\\" look into what the institution is all about. Some of the things that were important to me were the discussion of diversity, safety and security, and athletics and I finally found information about these aspects that no one else seemed to have quite the same insight into. Part of that has to do with the fact that the book is student written and has quotes from students about each element covered. The great thing about this is that you're not just getting info from the administration about how wonderful the school is, but you also see the things that could use improving. Hey, all schools need improvement, I'm just glad I could get some honesty about what those things are. This is a great book and it helped me make some important decisions!	2005-05-13

I just finished reading this book and I found it extremely helpful. I'm seriously considering Wesleyan and I know that other students looking at the school would truly benefit from reading this insightful perspective.

Besides that, there is a ton of info that you won't find in other Reports (wink, wink). Everyone thinking about attending West Virginia U needs to pick this up.

I find that so often the reviews of schools only give information about academics and the like, but there is so much more involved in campus life, and you generally never get that information. It was great to know the student perspective on the drug scene, diversity, and even something as seemingly unimportant as weather. The thing is, all of these things ARE important because they make up the culture. College is not just about writing papers or doing experiments and it's good to know where you're really going before you get there!	2005-05-13

Villanova is a school that's hard to get to know if you just walk on campus for a tour. This book gave me the insight that I didn't get from my college visit, or information session. I'm so glad this book is available, because the student perspective is unlike anything else I've found. Now I feel like I can make a more accurate decision about whether or not I want to go to 'nova. It's thanks to this book that I know about the fun things (such as where to go for good food or movies) as well as the academics and other important issues like whether or not there is a prevalence of drugs on campus.

The information is provided in both an informative and interesting manner. I love the fact that it's entirely written by a current student and that I learned things I'd likely never have found out if I'd just relied on the bigger reports out there. Some of the unique elements include sections on \\"Guys and Girls\\", \\"Finding a Job or Internship\\", and \\"Off-Campus Housing\\". The student quotes are especially helpful, as they give insight into all aspects of the school's culture that you won't get on a college tour. I highly recommend this book.	2005-05-13

The phrase \\"Off the Record\\" says something really important about this book: it is information you won't find on the college website or at an information session on campus. You ESPECIALLY won't find this info in an unnamed national report that includes details on just about every school out there. This is an intimate look into the school and an excellent read as well.

I don't know of any other guidebook that's like College Prowler and everyone even considering U of T should get this book! Even if you're already enrolled, it has a great restaurant guide and talks about campus and off campus housing.	2005-05-13

I love the student perspective and the quotes that aren't afraid to get down to the nitty gritty details. You learn so much from this book that you wouldn't otherwise find out just from a campus tour. There's info about aspects such as athletics, greek life, diversity, academics, nightlife, and that's just naming a few!! I rate this book so highly because I think it does something a lot of guidebooks don't and that's to give an insider's look at what the school is really like.	2005-05-13

It was the first book where I felt like the author was writing the guide for me instead of for my parents. I loved the guides for entertainment around town and all the tips on housing and what not. In addition to that of course there is a lot of info on academics and student organizations. I think everyone looking at this school should get this book. It rocks!	2005-05-13
