In fact, I had the privilege of participating in one of Don Wetmore's three day programs about 10 years ago, and still use his strategies today in my own business.  My most recent book, 10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking (Warner Books, 2001) would not have been completed on time if I hadn't been well organized.  As an international professional speaker, I spend a lot of time traveling and I know from first hand experience that there is a correlation between good time management and career success.  Th opposite is true as well.  Failing to manage your time will limit your opportunities for success.<br /><br />Beyond career success, however, managing your time effectively permits you to do more of the things you want to do and enjoy a better quality of life every day-both at work and at home.  The K.I.S.S. Guide to Organizing Your Life guides you along the path to more effective time management, starting with the important step of balancing your life.  After all, good time management isn't based on doing the wrong things quicker-that just gets you nowhere faster.  Instead, this guide show you how to achieve better balance in every aspect of your life.<br /><br />Don has taken a complex topic and boiled it down to a simple step-by-step plan that can be readily implemented by all readers-and I like that.  There's enough complexity in your life already; the last thing you need is an even more complex and cumbersome system to manage it!  Luckily, Don has devised a easy-to-implement, 20-step action plan to organize your life.  In fact, if you follow one of Don'd steps each weekday for the next four weeks, you will be surprised by the enormous strides you'll make toward managing-and enjoying-tasks and responsibilities that may have once seemed overwhelming.<br /><br />The methods Don writes about, and uses every day, are not lofty theory, but, rather, practical, common sense tools and techniques that he has tested himself; If they work for him-and they can work for you, too.<br /><br />Lenny Laskowski, Author of National Best Selling Book:<br />\\"10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking\\"<br />President of LJL Seminars(tm)ty theory, but, rather, practical, common sense tools and techniques that he has tested himself; If they work for him-and they can work for you, too.
