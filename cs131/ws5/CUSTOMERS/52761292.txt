The authors describe in sufficient but not excessive detail the politics as well as the actual military peformance of the Division Azul. The internal intrigues of the Franco regime as well as the external relations with the Axis and Allied powers are juxtaposed to get a flavor of the tensions and balancing act that the Generalissimo had to perform. I bought my copy as soon as it was published in the 70s and will not part with it. For any student of international relations, WW2, or the Franco regime.	2005-10-07

His writing is clear, crisp and insightful without overreliance on academic jargon. More to the point, he reveals interesting tidbits about just how important these obsolete missiles were to preserving world peace.

Their futile war in 1897 marked a serious effort to take adantage of a tottering Ottoman Empire's dilapidation, but ultimately failed in its immediate designs. However, in the succeeding decade they and their Balkan neighbors would all feast on the carcass. The author does a good job of describing the Greek political factions and their machinations to manipulate the Great Powers to their cause.	2005-10-05

He does not gloss over the 3rd SS division's sordid origins, leadership or questionable wartime behavior but does pay attention to the dogged determination (some would call it fanaticism) that was the Waffen SS's claim to fame. I am only sorry Syndnor hung up his writing boots after this fine tome because he certainly had the flair to write popular history.  In sum, \\"Soldiers of Destruction\\" is an indispensable addition to any military history buff's library. I haven't read his new updated pb version but am certain it is as readable as the original, hardback edition I have.	2005-10-03

No one who reads this can come away without feeling that they have been violated in a very surreal and undefinable way. The litany of coverups and transparent lies coming out of this administration is breathtaking in its treachery and duplicity, and only a doubly blind person can't connect the dots to see that the 9-11 disaster required more than a little help from a superficially inept bureacracy. This is journalism honed to a fine art and challenges modern historians - put up or shut up and match this man's dedication at unmasking the truth. But no, Americans prefer to believe George \\"Goebbels\\" Bush's lies as he leads them to the Promised Land. Between Fahrenhei 911 and this book, there's more than enough circumstantial evidence to convict everyone in this administration of high treason.	2005-09-07

He does not shirk from the troubling issues, such as the perception by many American blacks that the Ethiopians looked down upon them as sons of slaves, or the readiness that many in this country showed to exploit and take advantage of the Ethiopian plight. The description of confrontations with Italian-Americans was also interesting, though I would have liked to have read more about white America's reactions to the Italian aggression. All in all, this is a good example of how a scholarly work of history should be written.	2005-08-29

This book did a good job of positing MOST (but not all) of the disparate perspectives generated by this movie. Indeed, I came away convinced that Gibson's assertions that this film was an honest representation of the Gospel to be disingenuous at best. He clearly had a medievalist, anti-Vatican II agenda to promote, a MelGibsonian Cult spinoff of Catholicism better suited to 14th century Germany than anywhere else.  As a  a non-denominational Christian (that in itself will make \\"true believers\\" question my sincerity), I was offended by the constant pre-screening debate over the implied anti-Semitism, and concluded this was the product of the Jewish Media's Instant Counterattack Mode on anything that even remotely resembles a stain on Hebrews or their religion. But, reflecting on the film and the criticisms in this book, I have reluctantly concluded there is some merit to the comments. Gibson could have shot the scenes in a different way and remained faithful to the sketchy, inconsistent Gospels. However, having said that, the critics seem to want to have this two ways, select the parts of Scripture they like, while denigrating or minimizing the clear message that the Jews WERE responsible for Jesus' death, with the Romans puzzled partcipants in what was to them a heathen socio-religious internal battle. <br />This statement will doubtless level at me the tired accusations routinely delivered to those who repeat the Truth, but in doing so my accusers will naturally miss the point entirely. Jesus' death at the hands of his own people represents the sins of all men who would rather murder a countryman than face the demons in their mirrors.  <br />In conclusion, this book is a worthy contribution to the discussion on troubling questions we have as a society with one foot in this century and one or two toes still lingering in the last 300 years.	2005-05-28

While he is quick to point out Iran's deceptive games he is surprisingly silent on Israel's similar decades-old record of obfuscation and outright repression of vital information (ask Vanunu.)Clearly, the Good Guys live by one set of rules, the bad guys don't get to have any. <br />The author provides a particularly fascinating glimpse into his home country of South Africa's complicity in assisting Iran, just as it did Israel under the apartheid regime (an appropriate pairing, considering that Israel has created apartheid amongst the Palestinians.)He doesn't delve too deeply into the rationale the black government in Pretoria uses io justify opposing American plans for hegemonistic domination, nor doe he describe the massive assistance Washington gave Afrikaaner Pretoria to support apartheid, sanctions not withstanding. <br />Venter is on shakier ground when he makes his case for the danger to the world when (not if) Iran acquires the Bomb. Not once does he ask the question, How responsible would the leaders of Iran be NOT to develop the Bomb in the wake of Dubya's pronouncements that they're part of an \\"Axis of Evil?\\" Our so-called President has pratically forced both Iran and North Korea to accelerate their nuke programs (and on this day, 5-7-05, Kim Jong-Il seems poised to test his first device.)No, Venter just assumes that a fundamentalist Islamic government is bad, while remaining silent on why a fundamentalist regime in Washington is OK. Of course, the Iranians are \\"terrorists\\" and do bad things to unarmed civilians so that automatically makes them villains, while the same US acts against Iraqi civilians are called noble and patriotic \\"acts of war.\\" Venter doesn't get into the semantics game, he just goes with the double-standard flow. <br />I conclude thatIran with the Bomb actually makes the world a far safer place, because it forces our Rogue President to actually THINK before he rides off into the sunset bent on ill-considered and deceptively-justified imperialist adventures. <br />In conclusion, Venter has done a good job in acquiring facts, though when he strays into political commentary and issues paens to all his cohorts he  gets longwinded and, as I said, skates on a thin ice of presupposed bad guys and transparently hypocritical good guys. But he is clearly an ideologue with an agenda, to make the world scared of anyone actually standing up to US imperialism. That's why poor little Cuba to this day is victimized by US punitive sanctions way past Havana's posing any threat to anybody save the Miami mini-Bautistas. Iran with the Bomb, however, will be a force to be reckoned with. Maybe then Bush will start thinking before he opens his mouth. But I doubt it.	2005-05-08

Indeed, the standard still exists among many who still buy into the myth of a democratic \\"Republican\\" Spain (as Republican as Pol Pot's Kampuchea was Democratic.)The tension between a decaying British Empire and a muscular, confident USA on this issue made Franco supremely smug about the West ultimately coming around to his anti-Soviet way of thinking. In the face of guilt-ridden France and Britain's intransigence towards Franco's participation in NATO, the US took the toro by the horns and signed a bilateral agreement giving base rights in Spain. The book is a little light on the Soviet side of the issue but the author's focus was on the Anglo-American conflict over Franco. I recommend it for any student of the early Cold War.	2005-01-04

I couldn't help but smirk at the irony of Indonesia, itself the victim of 300 years of European oppression,  so easily slipping into the imperialist vacuum created by a retreating Portugal in 1975. Not satisfied with merely supplanting the Lusitanians, the Indonesians did them one better, instituting a 25 year war of savagery against the Timorese freedom fighters. The oft-repeated tale of UN bungling, US indifference and Indonesian foot dragging bears reading again, because, let's face it, despite innumerable politicians mouthing \\"Never Again!\\" to allusions of genocide, it has (Kosovo, Rwanda, etc.) and will continue to be the policy of choice for illiberal governments eager to suppress dissent among unpopular minorities. <br />The only complaint I have is common to essay books, in that some repetition occurs, but overall I give this a thumbs up.	2004-12-30

At first pro, then con, Russia's primary interest was in balancing power in Europe. This called for support when Napoleon was ascendant, then against when the great dictator was deposed once and for all. Rivalry with Britain was no small contributor to the Russian calculus, which attempted to shore up its own claims on the North American west coast while also providing the Russian market with rare raw products, such as coffee. The great irony, of course, is that, almost 100 years after the Latin revolutions that successfully overthrown Spanish corruption and mismanagement, czarist Russia was itself destroyed by the same impulses and motivations. <br />This is a well written summary of an interesting sidenote to the Napoleonic struggles, which can make a claim to be The First World War in that countries outside of Europe were active participants in the revolutionary energies emanating from the Old World.	2004-12-30

While there is a lot of information in there to buttress the author's apparently overwhelmingly convincing premise, it is true that only the most statistical minded will find all of the quantitive information intriguing. I skipped over most of the charts and diagrams, but there is no denying that much of the author's recounting is facinating, especially with regards to the social implications of each plague outbreak.

The author has shown admirable resolve in tracking down the details about the whys and wherefores of the nuclear weapons community's disdain for the damage caused by nuclear-induced fires. However she does get redundant more than she needs to be, and she early on makes the salient points that the rest of the book ponderously reiterates. She touches on the nuclear winter controversy, but in an almost cursory fashion; odd, considering the central role fires played in that raging debate. (I am proud that I avoided saying \\"that firestorm of controversy.\\")  <br />Still I recommend adding it to the nuke fan's library as she does add a needed dimension to the entire philosophy of nuclear war fighting, a concept too absurd to exist in any but our own techno-crazed society.	2004-12-06

He cites interesting cases but strays off on tangents and reaches conclusions that could just as easily be reversed with a slightly different perspective. Clearly he has an agenda and refuses to seriously consider subtlety or nuance, dismissing such attempts as \\"counterculture\\" or misguided liberalism. Though there is no argument with regard to the very real dangers that the money of the drug business poses to national governments evrywhere, he decides to strike out at hippies, anti-war protestors, the CIA and George Soros, who he obviously equates to the AntiChrist.There remains to be written a book with this topic that is not judgemental and avoids aimless redundancies. Still, having said all this, Johnson did get me thinking about these issues, and even made me appreciate some of the arguments against decriminalization. Though I don't agree with much of his analysis, he poses interesting viewpoints that everyone should be aware of.	2004-10-17

American exceptionalism has always required demonization of a perceived villain or adversary, the Devil if you will, in order to mask our neo-imperialist ambitions. As Mitchell argues in her concluding chapter, Imperial Germany and its bombastic monarch made convenient demons to suit the ambitions or moods of particular institutions, such as the Navy or the yellow press, and even Woodrow Wilson conjured up the Teutonic bogeyman when it suited him. <br />In reality, the central theme of her book is of inconsequential historical significance, since the German dog had no bite to support its shrill bark (as one German wag deftly remarked.)There simply never was any credible German threat to American security or even the ambiguous Monroe Doctrine to worry about. But what is more relevant today is how perception can be manipulated to justify imperialism in the guise of some nobler ideal. If you need any modern evidence of this proclivity of ambitious politicians, look at the Iraqi Tar Baby and the President that's struggling to break free of it today. <br />This book is a must-read for any serious student of international relations, especially of the tense situation prior to WW One.	2004-10-04

It is every American's patriotic duty to read this \\"Last Word\\" on the origins of bin Laden's jihad, if for no other reason than to see how unstable our current \\"War on Terror\\" is, precisely for the same reasons that spawned Al-Qaeda in the first place. Essentially, nothing has changed from the good ol' days of the anti-Soviet war when the US heavily relied on the good will and intentions of the Saudis and the Pakistanis to assist the Afghans, while we turned away, blithely and cheerfully ignorant of those messy little details, such as the preaching in the Saudi-financed madrassas of anti-Western venom and the Pakistanis setting up training facilities for Afgans and Arabs to fight its Kashmiri insurgency. Of course, it is precisely these same Saudis and Paskistanis that we rely on to fight Al-Qaeda, all the while they are funding and protecting them. Hey America! Fill up your tank and fund the terrorists! Cole has done an outstanding job of showing how bureaucratic politics and a profound lack of understanding and imagination in the CIA and White House has led us to where we are today. Oh, and for good measure, he shows how the Bush administration has once again misled (if not lied) to the American public about how the idea of smashing  airplanes into buildings never occurred to anyone; the Filipinos shared with us in 1995 plans they discovered to do just that. So, naturally, when known sympathizers of bin Laden's appear in the US and take flying lessons for commercial jets, no one in Bush's White House lifts a finger to protect the American people. Need any other reasons for dismissal? <br />However, to be fair, Clinton and Richard Clarke have grave cause for guilt also; they had a chance to have bin Laden captured and blew it, plain and simple. There's plenty of blame to go around in Cole's fascinating account of a book that demonstrates the validity of the Law of Unintended Consequences. Doubtless his next book verifying that axiom will be about the disastrous decision to attack Iraq.	2004-09-21

Like all books composed of essays from different authors, the quality varies, thus the 4 stars instead of 5 (actually a 4.5 seems the best rating.) Having said this, the end result of these depictions of \\"death sqauds,\\" a term the authors have a difficult time agreeing on themselves, is that they work. Governments or individuals can employ contracted hit teams to intimidate, murder, rape or in general terrorize opponents with telling effect, all the while hiding behind a mask of feigned outrage. In India's case the tactic effectively neutralized seccessionist movements in Kashmir and the Punjab. While one can point to South Africa's even more exaggerated usage of such state terrorism and its subsequent failure to avoid apartheid's defeat, this book offers an intriguing rationale that one might overlook. Eventually the state apparatus achieved such omnipotence that it threatened the very entities it was designed to protect. Whether this had any effect on DeKlerk's eventual decision to decontruct the racist state is unclear, but certainly the ironic potential of the state terror consuming itself would not have dissuaded him from his historic path. The essay on Sebia's use of contracted ethnic cleansers is interesting because it does make plausible Miloisevic's denial of direct responsibility; all he did was arrange for local militias and imported Serb fighters to acquire the weapons they used to \\"ethnically cleanse\\". It becomes harder to make the case that he ordered specific cases of \\"genocide,\\" a term that has been grossly misused for purely political and emotional reasons. However, the buck has to stop with the top dog (evidently not true with the Bush administration, though.) <br />This is a good book. I was a little surprised that it left out Colombia, or Sri Lanka, countries that have active death squad activities, or even Northern Ireland. Maybe there will be a follow-up edition that will give wider scope to active insurgencies.	2004-09-03

I have read all sorts of political histories on the war but Appy had produced an outstanding compendium of all the significant perspectives. By doing so he had made the horror, stupidity, immorality and sheer futility more alive than a thousand dry academic tomes could possibly aspire to do. Appy has even resisted the temptation to get into the We Coulda Won the War if Only... debate in a direct way but this was nicely and succintly summed up when one &quot;patriot&quot; in 1970 insisted we only needed to invade the North to win. In response, he was asked with what the US would invade with, as American troops by that time were either deserting in larger and larger numbers or refusing to expose themselves to the danger of being &quot;the last man to die in Vietnam.&quot;  <br /> What is most noteworthy about this book is that it offers us an opportunity to compare the stupidity of the past US government, convinced it had a mandate to defeat an alien ideology bent on destroying us, with the current one, similarly inclined to view its overseas struggle as a crusade against anti-Western ideologues. Just as LBJ's perspective was fatally flawed, we are seeing and will continue to see how the current blindness to geopolitical realities is doomed to fail in the sands of Iraq. <br /> Doubtless Appy or a relative of his will be writing Patriots II 30 years from now, about our failed adventure in the Middle East. (And please, don't give me any of that bunk about Iraq being about terrorism or WMDs or anything like that. We all know that's poppycock. It was all about protecting Saudi oil.)	2004-08-05

Part of the explanation can be found in Richardson's excellent little book, which describes how, through and through, the International Brigades were creatures of the Kremlin, with the sole intent the sovietization of Spain. He tells the tale of the recruitment of this Red Foreign Legion, which had two main goals; the defense of the Spanish Rrepublic and as a propaganda and training tool to promote international communism.<br /><br />While many if not most in the media today continue to characterize Franco as the fascist bad guy, aided by Hitler and Mussolini, this conflict demonstrates how fuzzy the whole issue of fascism vs democracy vs communism really was back then. As it turns out, Hitler was absolutely right in his assertion that Spain had to be saved from Bolshevism, am opinion that the western democracies blithely ignored. Unfortunately, many Spaniards have been so propagandized to hate Franco that the truth has been obscured. And it is today simply politically unthinkable to even suggest that Hitler could have actually done the right thing while democratic stalwarts like Roosevelt did nothing but mouth platitudes.<br /><br />Reichardson's book is an outstanding example of how personal recollections and archival research can create a compelling view of a significant aspect of a little-known war. Highly recommended to any student of communism or pre-war Europe.	2004-07-28

Read the book, watch the movie, write a review! But the important thing about Criles' book is that it yet another piece of the puzzle that constitutes history, the history of today and now. It is the best demonstration I know of how personal idiosyncracies, those of Wilson, Avrokotos, Herring, et al., drive the historical process. I remember how enraged I, a born-again liberal Texan (I know, almost an oxymoron) was at the USSR's intervention. Coming on the heels of the Indochina debacle, it was as if the Russians were kicking us when we were down. The opportunity the Kremlin handed us to repay them for Vietnam was too good for a few Texans, notably Joanne Herring to pass up, so Criles takes us on a very merry ride describing how a budding romance, good old fashioned pork barrel politics, a slick-talkin', hard drinkin', skirt-chasin' good ol'boy (LBJ surely smiled on Charlie) and an anti-establishment establishment dude like Gust Avrokotos team up with the military dictator Zia of Pakistan to &quot;defeat&quot; the Evil Empire. <br /> But that's the best part of all. Despite the hype about what was done to finance and train the mujahadeen resistance, the Soviet Union was NOT defeated in a miltary sense, just as the US was not beaten on the battlefield in Vietnam. They departed for the same reasons; politics and economics. And the Soviet Union would have collapsed anyway, regardless of whether they stayed or withdrew from the Tar Baby. And the Muslims would have launched their anti-West jihad in any case, simply because the time was ripe, with one superpower on the ropes and the other arrogant and exuberant about its sudden, unopposed world supremacy, to remind the secular powers that God was the only true superpower. <br /> In summary, Criles' book is a must read that will make a great movie (but Hanks as Wilson? Nope. Try Bruce Willis.) This is not a history book per se but an essential read for understanding how, to paraphrase Tip O'Neill (another player in the story), &quot;All history is personal.&quot;	2004-07-22

The authors were involved in the GDR's activities in the Dark Continent and do an admirable job of describing the fits and starts of the German efforts to support liberation movements in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. At first more theoretical supporters of anti-colonial movements, the GDR became an enthusiastic (and as the authors imply, sometimes overly zealous) proponents of both armed and political solutions to the struggle against minority rule.

I came away from reading this book with the distinct impression that the early Church had a definite problem convincing the masses that Judaism and Christianity had to be treated as distinct and separate beliefs, and that a certain amount of propaganda as well as intimidation was required to get the message across. While the theologians and exegetes like Cyril were debating the consequences of fitting angels onto pinheads, the people were routinely mixing and matching Jewish and Christian rituals bad doctrines. Little wonder that &quot;heresy&quot; found fertile ground in which to mushroom. Wilken does a good job, if at times repetitively, of describing Jesus' portrayal as The New Adam, the redeemer of Adam's sin, who, as Man and God, was able to defeat death, a feat that Moses, still only a mortal, and the law brought down from Sinai was unable to do. This was the basis of Cyril's refutation of Nestorius, which seems like a bit of an overreaction to what Nestorius really meant.<BR>I would have liked to have seen a bit more discussion of why Cyril was so adamantly anti-Jewish, though from his discussion it's pretty clear that this was partly because Cyril perceived them as &quot;mad&quot; and &quot;blind&quot; for their failutre to accept Jesus. But Cyril's orchestration of the pogrom in Alexandria deserved a bit more exposition vis-a-vis Cyril's ongoing polemical war on Judaism. This is  a trifling criticism, though.<BR>A must text for patristic history buffs.	2003-11-07

He has done a superior job of placing Cold War politics and ideological impetus in the context of the revolutionary movement in the Third World. His description of the growing Ethiopian-Somali estrangement and the conunundrum this placed the USSR and Cuba is a fascinating example of how propagandistic bombast can hoist its practitioners on their collectivist petards. Patman does a superb job of using quotes from official publications to establish the atmosphere of socialist bloc optimism for the future that now seems so transparently pathetic, akin to the roar of a wounded lion in its death throes. The only tiny fault I found was his minimal treatment of the role played by the Eritrean and Tigrean revolts in the regional politics. And it is unfortunate that Patman wrote his fabulous book a year before Revolutionary Ethiopia entered the dustbin of history. This book is a must have for the student of international Cold War politics.	2003-11-07

The subject is more fascinating than this book reads. The author repeats himself way too many times and offers us a very limited perspective on the topic. Admittedtly that view, of the legitimacy of the representation of the Baltic peoples through their foreign legations, limits discussion, but the human dimension of an imprisoned people struggling for cultural survival deserves more than the dry legalese this book is written in.<BR>Since there is so little on this subject, for aficionados of esoteric cold war conflicts, this is almost a must-read. Hopefully someone will take up the mantle and write a volume on the people of the Baltic diaspora that helped these isolated legations maintain the embers of repressed nationalism.	2003-05-28

The author has adroitly woven a tapestry of the give and take between the ideologically rigid Vietnamese liberators and the ideologically-opportunistic Khmer Rouge. The irony of the title is that there was no \\"after the Khmer Rouge:\\" indeed, they are still alive and well and running the PRK's successor state, which could be called the Democratic People's Republic of Royal Camobodia, an amalgam of ex-Pol Potists, Sihounoukists and genuine deomocrats. <BR>Gottesman is to be congratulated on his shrewd observations and the skillful way he merged the ever-morphing political landscape in Phnom Penh with the relatively static, self-serving and corrupt provinical politics that tended to ignore any central dictums that reduced local prerogatives. In sum, pretty much the story of all socialist states; proclaim endless drivel ex cathedra from the capital and pray that somebody out there listens.<BR>This is a must read for anyone interested in a little known asterisk in the cold war and anyone interested in third world politics.

I would have liked more insight into the Tamil leader Prabhakaran's mind (like maybe with an interview.) Though the epilogues give a very brief updating of the conflict after 1990, more info on LTTE's efforts to obtain legitimacy internationally since then would have been nice.

What emerged from this controversy was not, as some might believe, an unimitigated triumph for catholic orthodoxy, but a diluted, compromise acknowledgment in the Constantinopolitan creed (so called &quot;Nicene&quot; creed recited in the Ctaholic and Orthodox Church today)that the Holy Spirit deserves the same worship as the Father and Son, but no explicit equation of the three as being God. And even this required the Emperor Theodosius to issue an edict requiring that the three be equally worshipped. I would have liked a little more of the Pneumatomachian view than Haykin provided, but his exposition of the exegesis used to marginalize them adequately describes why the heresy met the fate it met.	2003-02-11

I thought I pretty much knew most of the political intrigue aspects of WW 2, but Osborn's revelations about the machinations involving Britain, France, Finland, Scandinavia, Turkey, Germany and the USSR are fascinating and will surprise many of my ilk.<BR>The options for initiating hostilities with the Soviets that the British and particularly the French entertained had grave implications for the war and the subsequent history of the world. What if the \\"Allies\\" had gone to war with the Russians in 1939 in defence of the Finns? The dynamics of this scenario are potentially endless. <BR>The belief that Russia was as grave a threat, if not more so, than Hitler's Germany, comes across very strongly in Osborn's \\"instant classic\\" work. Stalin's treacherous attacks on Poland, the Baltic states and Finland ranked him next to Hitler in the eyes of the world, and the fact that the USSR was supplying the Nazis with embargo-busting material shipments made the prospects of killing dozens of birds with one stone too tempting for many in the UK. Attacking Stalin's lair in Finland, the Crimea and the Caucausus were tempting goals for many who preferred fighting in someone elses' backyard instead of their own Sitzkrieg \\"front.\\" The hypocrisy of the Allies in deferring conflict with the Germans in favor of the weaker Soviets did not go unnoticed but was overwhelmed by the fear of another WW 1 holocaust and the need to bolster morale by doing something.<BR>The drawback of this title is its price, like many of the Greenwood titles. But it needs to be in your library.	2002-10-01

From the very beginning, Naimark shows how the Moscow Germans (Ulbricht, et al) were apologists for everything and anything the Soviets did to their conquered German &quot;friends.&quot; This more than anything else painted the Communists and their &quot;United Front&quot; Party, the SED, as little more than stooges for the hated Russians. Thus, the GDR leadership had no legitimacy in the eyes of the average worker. Naimark's study also describes how complete Sovietization was in the arts and education, though he only peripherally describes the Lutheran Church's involvement in the social transformation being wrought. This is curious, since it was the Church that provided a haven for dissent in the future years, but Naimark clearly had to prioritize his subjects of focus. This is a &quot;must-have&quot; for anyone interested in the Cold War, the GDR and the Soviet Union.	2001-08-07

I would have enjoyed more examples of a personal nature, such as when Williams briefly describes the local efforts to resist Soviet soldiers' brutality. This is a minor criticism, however. I found the politics fascinating, but no Czech or Slovak leader, perhaps most especially Dubcek, is left unscathed by the damning record of vacillation, subtle and often blatant deception, and finally capitulation(&quot;realism&quot;) and corrosive accommodation. Williams' ends his book  most fittingly, with a quote from Czech students after Jan Palach's suicide that sums up the sorry story of a quest for liberty without commitment or sacrifice.I also found the underlying tension between Slovak and Czech most enlightening, and goes a long way to understanding the always subsurface resentment that ultimately led to the &quot;Velvet Divorce,&quot; which may have its roots in the Prague Spring debacle.This book is a must for anyone interested in the local intrigues in this seminal event of the Cold War, but Williams only lightly touches on many other interesting issues that have yet to coalesce in a definitive treatment.	2001-01-06

DeWaal has written a superb volume describing the gross violations of human rights and the consequences of willy-nilly, no-strings-attached  Western aid during the Ethiopian wars for national liberation and the  devastating famines of the mid 80s. He rightly points out, as has Shawcross  in his &quot;Quality of Mercy,&quot; that in their eagerness to placate  oppressive governments in order to provide the starving with aid, Western  charitable organizations risk prolonging conflicts and exacerbating civil  unrest.  He points out that historically Ethiopia has suffered localized  famines that have been alleviated by regional surpluses, and that  Mengistu's Dergue intentionally deprived rebellious areas of this surplus  by bombing villages, drastically curtailing travel, incentives to trade,  etc. So, while there was no explicit effort to starve the rebel populace,  the Dergue was able to manipulate the situation to its advantage. How many  in the West even heard of the TPLF or EPLF during the Famine of '84 and  '85? The Western press was blind to the conflict, probably because the  right-wing Reaganauts didn't see the independent and left-sounding  Tigrayans and Eritreans as &quot;white enough&quot; to be African contras.  His book terminates right after the fall of the Mengistu regime, and he  makes good recommendations for ensuring peace in the region. Alas, the  subsequent events have shown that these ideas were, for the most part, not  implemented, and today we have as much animosity as during the depths of  the Marxist and royalist regimes. His book serves as a reminder to the  guilt-ridden West that good intentions are not enough when tackling famine,  and that the political as well as social dimensions must be considered. Am  I suggesting that the West should have ignored the plight of the starving  Ethiopians and Eritreans? Of course not. But if the West had been more  insistent on full access to all sides in the conflict there might have been  a quickerend to the civil war. As it was, Mengistu probably bought himself  at least three more years of bloody, fratricidal rule.	2000-08-07

Though in places Pry seems a bit carried away, he does make hispoint- that Russia in its weakened state has not lost an ounce of itsGreat Power Illusion nor its xenophobia. His examples of near-war situations should, however, be looked at a bit skeptically. Perhaps the scariest example was the 1995 Northern Lights fiasco, which somehow teetered on the nuclear brink, in peacetime and without major crises (though Pry does try to make a case for Bosnia being a major sore point.)  Overall, though, I found this most illuminating and certainly deserving of more discussion in the general media than it's received to date.	2000-06-21

This is a dreadful book by any standard. It is full of wrong facts as well as dates, and it is endlessly repetitive: Mr. Fregosi probably only wrote ten pages of so-called history and then just re-worded these to fill out  the book. And his thesis of jihad is so simplistic and medieval in its good  guy-bad guy depictions as to make it an embarrassment for me to read. In  fact, I returned this to the store (which I almost never do, regardless of  how I liked a book), just because it was so repugnant to me. I feared its  inferiority would somehow infect my other, legitimate history books. This  book really deserves to be called fiction. Come to think of it, just stay  away from it and call it nonexistent. (It deserves negative stars! )	2000-06-07

I would like to have seen the professor write a lengthier book, in  fact, that could have gone into more detail about Cuba's involvement with  guerilla wars and espionage, subjects that are, by necessity, dealt with  briefly.

Though Yohannes seems at  times to be less than objective, on balance I think he gives a concise  picture of the manner in which the so-called &quot;free&quot; world turned  its back on Eritrea's right to self-determination, all the while protesting  communism's trampling of the same rights. The Eritreans, in fact, have been  so scarred psychologically by this hypocrisy that they now have a  &quot;bunker&quot; mentality that sees no friends but many potential foes.  This in part explains their intransigence towards Ethiopia about a few  square miles of worthless desert. This is a good purchase for anyone  wanting a basic understanding of the now 50 year old Ethiopian-Eritrean  conflict, which appears now to be entering a sixth decade, with no end in  sight.	2000-06-02

However, in so doing he does understate the hard-line  nature of the Leninist (Coard) faction, which did see itself as the  legitimate revolutionary faction, ultimately destroying itself and its  Stalinist vision. However, the focus is on Cuba's involvement, which  clearly did not see Grenada as anything other than a fellow socialist state  struggling to overcome a hostile political environment in the Caribbean.  That is not to say that Castro did not intend to collaborate with the New  Jewel Movement in exporting revolution, but with a larger and better  located Nicaragua on the mainland as a partner, Grenada had, by necessity,  to be the most junior of colleagues. I would like to have seen this aspect  developed more, but Cotman obviously wants to paint a sympathetic picture  here. I recommend this book, even at its lofty price, for anyone interested  in hearing another side to this still controversial issue.	2000-06-02

I would  like to have seen more about the linkage between the collapse of Communism  worldwide and the pressures on the South African government, but the focus  of this fine book was on the ANC/SACP relationship.

His focus is on Constantinople, but the  intrigues of Russia, Lithuania and to a lesser extent Poland in the  struggle for supremacy in Great and Little Russia are described also.

Mr. Zhai's contribution to Cold War history is a worthy addition to any CW buff's collection, since China's role in the conflict has always been a mix of &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; paranoia, rumor and biased commentary. It is a  sound summary of the initially cozy, then increasingly frosty relations  between the two communist Asian nations. However, being familiar with many  of the observations made in this book from other sources, I was hoping for  a more cogent analysis of the synergy between the radicalization of Mao's  vision of perpetual revolution and the Indochinese wars. For example, did  the Cultural Revolution hinder or help the Vietnamese, and what were their  perceptions? Did China encourage Pol Pot's intransigence vis-a-vis Hanoi  because of ideological affinity or just plain spite? How did the Ussuri  River clashes affect the Soviet supply link to Hanoi? This is a good volume  for factual summary of the events, but a more profound reading of the  new  archival sources needs to follow.	2000-05-16
