Now, on with my review... <br /> <br />My Daughter's Boyfriend was well written and in some strange ways, funny. The story revolved around thirty-something-year-old, Tracey, her seventeen-year-old-daughter, Lauren, and Lauren's twenty-one-year-old boyfriend, Aaron. <br /> <br />Aaron and Lauren are happy together, so Lauren thinks, until Aaron sees Tracey half naked one day. Aaron starts to boldly reveal feelings to Tracey indicating his attraction toward her. And so the story goes... <br /> <br />Tracey is fighting with herself over the same feelings of attraction she has towards Aaron. Should I? Shouldn't I? He's too young...shame on you Tracey...but he's so fine... Never once did Tracey stop and think HE'S MY DAUGHTER'S BOYFRIEND! <br /> <br />Tracey beats herself up until lust takes over. She and Aaron have a hot night of passion. They start to lust, excuse me; the story says LOVE each other, and Aaron decides to leave Tracey. Yada yada yada... <br /> <br />Though My Daughter's Boyfriend was flawlessly written, well put together (too well) and painted a story you could envision, I couldn't stomach the scenes and storyline. Just sickening! I don't have a daughter, but I do have three boys and never could I ever imagine hurting them behind their backs. It was troublesome to read the dialog between Aaron and Tracey, where he's telling her that Lauren (her daughter) begged him to spend time with her , but he didn't because he wanted to see her (Tracey). How could any mother be well with that?  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I can't tell you how the story ends. I didn't make it that far. Hopefully it ended with Tracey ringing Aaron's sarcastic little neck. Yes, on top of the fact that he was hurting Lauren to Lauren's mother's face, he was very cynical with his remarks to Tracey. Read the book to find out.  <br /> <br />Sorry, but this one just didn't do it for me. It was truly a page turner, just not my type of page turner. However, to be fair with my review I still gave My Daughter's Boyfriend 4 stars due to its perfected writing style.  <br /> <br />Rolanda, <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-08-22

This novel is a story of a woman, Celie, who finds both her voice and her own self through the rediscovery of love after she has experienced much torment. Throughout the course of the book, Celie suffers from incest, physical and emotional degradation, and repeated separation from those she loves, which all makes her stronger.     The oppression Celie is subjected to is caused by the men that she loves - her stepfather who molests her and her husband who treats her like his slave. She's forced to find her independece and self-respect not through a man, but through a woman, Shug, who is her husband's lover on the side.     Through her relationship with Shug, Celie experiences love and learns to have a better understanding of herself and learns how to stand up for herself.     The Color Purple is the thought provoking story of the valiant women in our world, told through a series of letters that Celie addresses to God, and later to her long lost sister.

After months of thinking and thinking, we decided to close our eyes and choose one.     NOT WITH MY SON captivated our members with its many suspenseful twists and turns. Yet, at the same time, threw us aback with its fairytale scenes from time to time.  I won't spoil this read for anyone debating on picking this book up, but I will say this is for you if you're looking for a page turner.     Keesha Smalls is thirty-five and in love with her best friend's son, twenty-one year old Chris Walker. This lost me, not because of the age difference, but because of the reasoning behind her interest in Chris. True, he was successful, handsome, but so was she! What was it about Chris that Keesha just couldn't get a grip on? The author should have made this more clearer. Instead, Chris comes over one day, confesses his feelings toward Keesha (he's just as in love with her as she is with him), then next thing you know he's hammering her (as the author puts it). I don't know if I'd be so quick to believe that. I would have liked to have seen more of a relationship forming between them before sex came into play.       Keesha takes a trip to California where she visits one of her girlfriends who makes her presence known to Jamal, another successful man - this one, a doctor who also has been longing for Keesha, only Jamal is more her age.     Keesha and Jamal get it on in California and when she leaves, she leaves with an engagement ring. I understand this is fiction, but come on! Jamal is a doctor who delivers babies, yet he makes irresponsible choices like having sex with a woman he hasn't seen in years and falls deeply in love with her? (Scratching my head)    There are other events throughout the book that makes you stop and shake your head in disbelief, like the anger Chris' mother has toward her friend, Keesha ALL BECAUSE SHE TAKES INTEREST IN HER SON! I couldn't see where the logic was here. However,  overall this still makes for a good read due to the drama, suspense, and series of torments that Keesha has to go through all because of Chris.     Hope Clark has many titles under her belt, all that will definitely be read by our book club members. Readers will not be disappointed with her novel NOT WITH MY SON, just be prepared to occasionally raise a brow at the shallow characters from time to time.

Set in the 1830's, The Known World is a story of Henry and Caldonia Townsend, two educated black slave owners in Manchester County, Virginia. Henry owns 33 African American slaves! He learned the art of owning slaves from his master, William Robbins, who took pride in teaching Henry everything there was to know about slavery. He was bought out of slavery as a boy by his father who now disapproves of his son's holding slaves. When Henry dies, his widow tries to hold the plantation together, but fails.   <br />  <br />Sheriff, John Skiffington and his newly wedded liberal white wife are both Bible thumping Christians who are against slavery. Skiffington tries to do the right thing by enforcing the law as morally as he can when dealing with slaves and their owners, but soon struggles with his own morals when he receives a 9 year old girl as a wedding present, which makes them quickly adjust to the southern living.  <br /> <br />While Skiffington struggles with his morals and views, he is convinced that the real problem with slavery is the \\"government\\", which ultimately made it hard for people regardless of their race to do the right thing.  <br /> <br />This book is not an easy read, there are many characters and the plot kept building and building. Still, Jones did a wonderful job of crafted a beautifully told story of an unknown world. Its strength was in its unique writing style, which took the reader's imagination and walked them through the times of slavery with ease. <br /> <br />Rolanda,  <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-05-25

Too much to endure	The overwhelming tragic themes of rape, incest suicide and murder are far too overdone and exhausting at times. On the other hand it is a hard book to put down with so much happening at once. This story was spilling over with so many secrets, unexpected twists and turns that I was always caught by surprise. <br /> <br />Fall on Your Knees deals with 3 generations of family living in the Cape Breton Island and focuses on the trials and tribulations of the very dysfunctional Piper family.    <br />I won't go into the synopsis of the story like I usually do, but will tell you Fall on Your Knees feeds you continuous \\"graphic\\" scenes of child molestation, homosexuality, rape, incest, and murder that are startling and in some ways tactless. It was hard at times to believe this family is considered \\"normal\\" after enduring a series of such tragic events over and over and over.  <br /> <br />Overall, Ann-Marie MacDonald does a wonder job of writing Fall On Your Knees and draws you right behind the closed doors of the Piper family's resident.

You WILL stay in this book until it's completed. I guarantee it. I didn't notice the character mix up that the reviewer from Rawsistaz speaks of, but did get confused on several scenes in the book. I had to read about Patricia and Kim a couple of times before I realized Kim was really Karen, and there were times throughout the book where I didn't know who was telling the story, but other than that, Divorce Him, Marry Me, was written to entertain, and that it did.  <br /> <br />Rolanda, <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-05-18

No one finds Venus attractive in this story. Venus doesn't find Venus attractive in this story!  <br /> <br />I usually do NOT give anything below three stars unless the story was an utter mess, which this was. I think it sends a terrible message out to the truly BEAUTIFUL, African American women with nappy hair. The title, Nappily Ever After says I'm proud of who I am regardless of the color of my skin or texture of my hair.

I must admit I couldn't put it down!!!! I finished He's Just Not That Into You in less than one hour!!! It was an easy read with humorous dialog.  <br />The book was written from two points of views: Greg Behrendt's and Liz Tuccillo's. I found both views to be helpful and honest. Beforehand, I thought Greg's would be more bias, but in fact, learned that his view was just as fair and straightforward as Liz's.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this \\"no excuses truth to understanding guys\\" book to any female who's constantly worrying over their mate. Ever wonder why he's not calling you? Pick up this book. Ever wonder why he disappears for days? Pick up this book. Ever wonder why he cheats? Pick up this book. It will save you the humiliation and stress of making the ultimate mistake of your life: marring a man who's just not that into you. <br /> <br />To the young girls just finding out about this thing called \\"dating\\", this book is for you also, but with a bit of advice before you read it. Don't be so quick to throw a guy away who doesn't want to have sex with you. That's what's wrong with society today. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT SEX PEOPLE! This was my only complaint with He's Just Not That Into You. This book teaches you that a man, in your case, a boy, is just not that into you if he doesn't come on to you. That's BOGUS! Get to truly know your boyfriend FIRST. If he comes on to you too fast DUMP HIM! <br /> <br />Rolanda,  <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-29

Their Eyes Were Watching God shows strength in the face of hardship told to us through the life of Janie. <br /> <br />Janie is married to Logan Killicks, the choice of her grandmother, Nanny, but he is far from the ideal Janie has imagined for herself. She wanted a fairy tale romance, but instead sacrificed that for a monetary relationship with him. Far from being his wife, as she would have hoped, she is instead treated as a daughter and a worker.  <br /> <br />Janie leaves Logan, only to fall for another man, Joe Starks, who is TOO financially stable, and offers Janie an easier lifestyle as the Mayor's wife. He dresses her up, and parades her around, but she has no voice in the relationship. Joe is unable to emotionally sustain her, and even resorts to violence against her, verbally attacking her for simple mistakes. She longs to be part of the group outside, talking and joking, but is unable to be herself when she is around Joe. Her thoughts flash back to the love she once dreamed about underneath the pear tree.  <br /> <br />Janie eventually finds this love with Tea Cake, her third husband. The two work side by side in the Everglades picking beans, and live in a shack much different from the comfortable home Janie was used to. However, the daily toil was well worth it to the couple, which enjoyed every second they shared together.  <br /> <br />After a tragic occurrence in the book (can't tell what it is), Janie is forced to make the most difficult decision of her life. In a split second, she is forced to choose between her life and the life of Tea Cake's, eventually returning to the life she had left long ago.  <br /> <br />Throughout the novel, the reader sees the trials and struggles Janie faces while growing up. However, these never keep her down. She faces loss from the opening page through the last, but her strength and willingness to accept and see the good make this novel a beautiful and inspiring work. <br /> <br />Rolanda, <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-04-29

Their friendship grows into a partnership in a small cosmetic business. Unfortunately, their friendship is abruptly ended due to interference by Gilda's uncle and first husband, which leaves hard feelings felt by Hosanna who struggles to keep her business going.   <br /> <br />Campbell does a spectacular job showing how one gets overwhelmed by grudges by not being able to function properly, follow their own dreams, and as a result run away from various issues in life. I liked how she tied in the issues of betrayal by fathers to their children, and how they worked out such sticky issues.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book deals with people with dreams and how to fight to keep the dreams alive. In addition, it showed the simplicity of a family that is overflowing with love and great family principles as well as what happens when we live our lives in continuous denial. I recommend this book for anyone who is not only looking for a fun read, but also wants to think about societal issues with some history. <br /> <br />Rolanda, <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-04-26

He gets a little too drunk at a Pro-Bowl party where a lady somehow ends up in his hotel room, naked. He has no idea how this could have happened and immediately runs to his wife. <br /> <br />Everything seems OK until he starts receiving mysterious letters from the lady found naked, lying next to him in his hotel room, who he later finds out is the daughter of the owner of the team he plays for! <br /> <br />Someone wants Tony out of the picture and uses the daughter to complete the mission when she cries rape and accuses Tony of the vicious act.  <br /> <br />Once in court, this book really starts to get good! I read literally NOSTOP as the courtroom is filled with drama while trying to figure out who is trying to frame Tony Williams and why!!  <br /> <br />This book gets an overall ten stars to say the least! It was that good. It starts off fast and ends at an even faster pace. It's full of mystery, suspense, issues of prejudice and the downside to interracial relationships. I thought it was all well put together and place this high on my recommendation list of books.  Good Job Grant! <br /> <br />Rolanda, <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club	2005-04-20

Thanks to her gruesome father, her innocence is lost at the precious age of eight years old. <br /> <br />Because of this, Flower is forced to mature quickly in order to cope with what has happened to her. She finds comfort in unhealthy relationships and even prostitution.  <br /> <br />In the end, justice is served in more ways than one. Without creating any spoilers, our little Flower finds peace and love, and grows to blossom into the \\"flower\\" that she is. <br /> <br />Flower's Bed portrays a very disturbing, yet very real image of the effects that molestation can have on our children. It's definitely not something to be ignored. I thought the book was well written, well put together, and very, very affective on the mind. Though times can be trouble, through love we can still conquer.  <br /> <br />Rolanda <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-04-11

Ms. Jackson, I should have caught on to your novels a long time ago, being that you've been writing for some time now. I must say better late than never as I have truly enjoyed your book. <br /> <br />Lil Mamas Rules takes a good look at the trials of a strong young lady named Madison McGuire. She has a great paying job, a great pad, a loving family and HER choice of men.  <br /> <br />While in college, she meets and falls in love with Chris, the man she planned to spend the rest of her life with until he ruins it by confessing his infidelity before their wedding.  <br /> <br />The wedding is off and Madison is through with men for good. She focuses on her younger sister's Tourettes disease and tries to learn to have patience with her, while dealing with her overly protective mother, absent father, and a boss that won't keep his hands off her. She's strong when handling all this stress so well, but turns weak for her only love, Chris, when he comes back to Los Angeles to claim her.  <br /> <br />Madison gives into the love that has never left her heart. Then she discovers she has HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. She loses it for a while, but through the love and support of her family, including her long lost father, and Chris, who never left her side, she is able to pull back together.  <br /> <br />This book was written to perfection. It was almost too perfect and didn't give you enough of a story. It was filled with too many (what we call) page fillers that didn't talking about much, which at times were very distracting.  Still, Ms. Jackson tells us to be careful of who we sleep around with, which is always a good thing.  <br /> <br />Rolanda, <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club	2005-04-07

It tells a story of a young man named Corey who has a loving mother and father and is taught to do all the right things in life, yet somehow ends up doing the total opposite.  <br /> <br />This is not your everyday shoot 'em bang bang, thugged out novel. It actually shows the effects of the pure pressure thats placed upon our young men. Take Corey for instance. He had all the attributes to life that a young boy could have. He was taught to get an education and was taught how to be a man from a man - his father. Still, the pressures from his friends made him turn to something that would ultimately cause him more harm than good.  <br /> <br />This book is for every young boy. Not only for those that are lost, in jail, or failing in school, but for every young boy. I would also recommend it to anyone who believes bad kids only spawn from single parents. You'll change the way you think for good after reading this. Good job Shannon. <br /> <br />Rolanda,  <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club	2005-04-05

I love it! <br /> <br />As Margaret goes from dull to glamorous, she finds out that all that glitters ain't gold! For me, this is where the story turns into a masterpiece. We as women want to be beautiful at any cost. We take it to the extreme by going broke, or worst, being something we are not! Margaret finds out in the end that beautiful just as she is!  <br /> <br />Donna Hill tackled something outside the norm for her, which I think she did a brilliant job in doing so.

Arnelle and Winston keep running into each other - not by choice - but by their friends Venice and Craig.  Arnelle and Winston can't stand one another, but on each meeting occasion, their hostility toward each other turns into an attraction that grows stronger. <br /> <br />I find Darrien Lee's novels (I've also read All that and A Bag of Chips some time ago) to be easy reading - sometimes too easy.  You're able to predict what will happen in each scene, all the way down to the ending. <br /> <br />It's evident Darrien Lee can write, but I would like to see more creativeness. Overall, What Goes Around Comes around, to me, was very simple, which isn't necessarily bad, it just doesn't leave you breathless or wanting more. It just leaves you. <br /> <br />Rolanda, <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-03-31

As much as I love Mr. Shannon Holmes (I've noticed that many refer to him as Ms.), B-More Careful was entertaining, but left a bad taste in my mouth when I finished reading it. For me, books are finished in a day or so. They have to be in order to keep it moving at our book club meetings. However, B-More Careful was completed in a whopping FOUR days. I knew then the book was terribly written. I wanted to believe in the characters but some of the stuff in this book was way over the top. To narrow down my review (I can sit here and go on and on and on about how I didn't like it), there were too many things going on in this novel. Way too many plots and scenes that jumped all over the place, not to mention the many errors that left me fighting to figure out what I was reading.  <br /> <br />Overall, I believe this book could have been better if some of the stories (notice here that I say STORIES) were divided up and placed in other books, perhaps even left for a sequel. I would also advise that the grammar and spelling be thoroughly checked before finalizing. This made it extremely hard to follow at times. <br /> <br />Better luck next time Mr. Holmes. <br /> <br />Rolanda,  <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-03-30

I just wanted to point that out and make that clear. <br /> <br />One of the ladies in our book club brought \\"The Hottest Summer Ever Known\\" to the table. I saw the book - read the title - then thought about \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\".  <br /> <br />The Hottest Summer Ever Known lacks originality and to be rather honest plagiarizes \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" in more ways than one could imagine.  <br /> <br />In spite of the copycat title and storyline, I must say that it conveys a message that should be ignored by no one. AIDS is real! AIDS DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE! AIDS ATTACKS THE BLACK COMMUNITY HARD! AIDS KILLS! So, rap it up and be safe. <br /> <br />Ms. Williams, I would like to see you try again. You're an author with a conscious mind, which is good. You're used as a tool from God to get your point across to everyone. I love that about you and your book. My only advice would be to be original in the process. Best of luck to you. <br /> <br />Rolanda <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br />	2005-03-25

Anna J, it's because of authors like you that we came up with Nothing BUT Page Turners for the title to our Book Club.

It was like we were the characters gathering around at the slumber party (for those who read it knows what I mean). A story within a story is what you get for the price of one book. I've never ever seen that done before. I commend the author for that.    A manuscript by an unknown author is the next in line to be discused amongst The Somebody Holla! Book Club members. As the four ladies sit around and talk/argue about the book, they soon began to turn on eachother. Their minor disputes unleash a few secrets and fantasies that create a tighter bond between them.     Overall, I just don't know if I bought the fact that one of the characters who loves reading books by Zane had a problem with almost every scene she ran across in the manuscript (scratching my head on this one). For those who follow Zane will know exactly what I mean. I also might add that if one of our members suffer a trama the way Trina (one of the members from Holla Back!) did, we would be all on it to help her through it. Trina had a nasty attitude and not one of the members lend a helping hand. That was a major problem for me.     Small packages is definitely erotic and in some parts quite humorous. Your money would not be wasted if you can look pass some of the errors throughtout the book.    Rolanda  Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club	2005-03-17

I think it's brilliant that Paula Edwards takes a stab at a subject most of us run away from.    Chancey is the main character dealing with adversity in his hood of Watts. He escapes once by going to Juvenile Hall, then again when he meets Tia.     The thing I liked most about this book was how it went from scene to scene, finally all unraveling toward the end. It was cute, sad, funny, very unpredictable, and most of all a wake up call to black America.     Overall, I gave this book 4 stars because of its creativity and well rounded characters. I could have done without the street slang, which made it hard to read at times.     I definitely see a sequel stemming from the book from the way Rondell was left to run free after causing such havoc to so many people.      Rolanda  Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club	2005-03-17

Left, with nothing, she turns to Pauline, her Psychiatrist who has a world of problems of her own, but still tries to help her recover from her fears of the unknown as well as discover her dual personalities.     Overall I rate this book a three only because it's not my type of story. If you're into to this type of stuff, but prefer more hype and action, try Zane's \\"Nervous\\". Same storyline, but with more of Zane's creativity if you know what I mean.    This was still a good book. I was able to finish it in less than two days.

Love's Game really teaches women that the everyday reality of cheating does exist. It reads as an eye opener to women, and at the same time shows them that somewhere in a man's doggish ways lies sincerity and regret. For the ladies that have been traumatized by a man's cheating ways, however, I WOULD NOT recommend this book. It really has you on edge at times.
