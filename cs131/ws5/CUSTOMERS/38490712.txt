David Shipler has gone into great depth to document their stories, to build empathy for people who cannot afford the luxury of even a moment's escape from their precarious struggles to live. Those who do escape often do so through drugs or alcohol, and even then sometimes find the character to overcome their despair.<br /><br />If there is a consistent theme in this book, a theme beyond the ubiquity of poverty in our society, it is that it is hard enough to be poor without society making it harder yet. The monetary costs of being poor are magnified for those without money: check cashing fees; inabilities to maintain bank accounts; poor public transportation; paper-laden bureaucracies; demands by people with money for cheap goods and labor such that the minimum wage remains below the poverty level and illegal immigrants are tolerated as long as they work cheaply and do not try to access to our social services. Not every poor person is a Dickensian hero, but many are. Just a little efficient help is all they might need. Our social services are inefficient. While our inept political parties argue over the role of government in a just society, the poor must navigate through layer upon layer of ridiculous waste in order to gain the minimum benefit available. There is a higher cost to society from poverty than the tax dollars necessary to address the problem comprehensively. As Shipler documents, there are now four and five generations of people who have suffered through our disgraceful system; they have imprinted both dependency and inadequacy and cannot be salvaged inexpensively.<br /><br />\\"The Working Poor\\" does a good job of building empathy for the poor among the empathetic, but it does nothing to draw hard-line conservatives out of their boot-strap superiority. Instead, conservatives need to be shown the true costs of poverty in real dollars; dollars that in some way ultimately come out of their own pockets-taxes or no taxes. Shipler does not achieve this. His ideals are high but his writing is dry; in page after page he documents the hard reality of poverty, like an investigative reporter, but then he throws in the odd metaphor or narrative device-he tries to create story, but without success. \\"The Working Poor\\" is packed with important information and deep research but is difficult to read. For a more readable book on this topic, try Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"Nickel and Dimed\\".ood job of building empathy for the poor among the empathetic, but it does nothing to draw hard-line conservatives out of their boot-strap superiority.

These are disheartening finds; one wants to believe that cheating is not this pervasive-but it is. Beginning with kindergarten, moving through high school and college, and finally into the workplace, though cheating has always existed (Callahan cites studies from the early 20th century), perhaps never before has it been accepted as way of life-an unchecked way of doing business. Callahan sees rampant cheating as an emergent condition, a natural consequence of deregulation and the laissez-faire economic policies of the Right, policies which reasserted themselves to begin a pillaging of the American character in the 1970s. His cause and effect analysis is hard to refute. Callahan avoids finger pointing; though it is obvious that this dilemma is a result of bad policy by the current ruling party, Callahan works hard to stick to the facts-to present the cause and effect relationships within an historical context. Still, the kettle is black regardless, and no amount of careful, unbiased wordsmithing can successfully circumvent the culprit.<br /><br />And this is the bottom line: cheating is bad, rampant, and expensive, but it is only a symptom of a much greater societal problem. Callahan includes a chapter of proposed solutions, solutions that sound great but seem too grandiose, requiring more commitment from the very perpetrators of this fiasco than anyone could reasonably expect. A simpler solution would be to begin to re-implement the laws and regulations that once protected us from runaway greed. I would have found the book more valuable if Callahan had explored the feasibility of this option.<br /><br />\\"The Cheating Culture\\" is well worth a read, if for no other reason than to bring this symptom into the forefront of everyone's mind in a way that is mostly non-partisan and non-threatening to reasonable people of any political ideology. The text is a little dry, and Callahan tends to repeat himself through chapters that do not build upon one another, but as he himself writes, \\"Cheating is a difficult subject to research.\\"y.

Books	5	10	14	N	N	More Substance Than Humor	During the 2004 presidential election, the forces of the Neo-Con Right went after Michael Moore with venomous, frothing lips. One reviewer on this very site compared Michael Moore to the bombastic Rush Limbaugh. This is not surprising since Moore seems to be the only one who can-or is willing to-expose the Right for what it is: corrupt, immoral, and unconnected to the reality of American life. What is surprising is that the Neo-Con Right seemed to have been somewhat successful in its campaign against Moore, surprising because Moore is not the one who is breaking the law.<br /><br />Alas, the fate of the messenger...<br /><br />It has been fascinating to watch Moore evolve from a keen observer and satirist into a voice against the darkness. \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\" is full of wit and humor, but from each page drips the terror of the Bush dynasty. This is as complete an expos&eacute; of George W. Bush as one will find anywhere, a literal primer for his impeachment. Unfortunately though, the other half of the country won't read it-the Neo-Cons have done such a thorough job of impugning Moore's character that even those only moderately on the right assume that this book is nothing more than accusation and innuendo. Nothing could be farther from the truth: Moore's facts are documented, and his chain of reasoning is rock solid. I do not agree with all of Moore's beliefs. \\"Belief\\" is the key word here, his facts are incontrovertible. My disagreement with some of Moore's beliefs does not exonerate George W. Bush or the Neo-Cons from the wrongs they have committed or the laws they have broken. This is the greatest lesson Moore has for our right-wing neighbors and Bush supporters: disagree with Liberal beliefs if you will, but don't ignore facts and don't support law-breaking and corruption just to get back at us.	2005-09-23

Random Threats from an Unarmed American	Books	4	2	4	N	N	More Humor Than Substance	Michael Moore's first book is old enough now for a review through hindsight. How did Moore's predictions hold up, and was \\"Downsize This!\\" sufficient to galvanize public opinion against Republican attempts to completely dismantle our nation's hard-fought business and environmental controls as well as against Democrat Party appeasers?<br /><br />History has shown that the American public lost this fight; if anything, \\"Downsize This!\\" is eerie in its prescience, however, like the metaphorical iceberg, Moore could only expose what was either on the surface at the time or else shallowly concealed below-what lay much deeper still was serpentine and sinister. Downsizing now seems prosaic when compared to Outsourcing, and NAFTA seems more like an amateur diversion in the face of the current Chinese-Wal-Mart hegemony. The motive for all of this undoing is greed, greed at every level of corporate and political life. Moore connects the dots between the rise of Reagan and the influence peddling of Clinton and the New Democrats. Today, of course, those dots paint a full picture, but at the time it was still possible to hope for a presidential candidate who would put a stop to all of this. Americans are optimists after all (well, perhaps not any more).<br /><br />I have found that older political books seldom hold up very well, and \\"Downsize This!\\" is no exception...except that political life in America has become surreal and Michael Moore has kept himself within the thick of it-he has grown in both wisdom and skill; his writing and films are now more biting than sarcastic; more angry than flippant. In \\"Downsize This!\\", Moore seems like a man at his wit's end with the transparent ridiculousness of the forces of greed in our country. He uses silly humor to vent his disdain upon the powerbrokers who appear to be able to have their way with us unchecked. But today, Moore's work has a hard, pleading edge to it-his humor does not distract from the terror he feels for our future. \\"Downsize This!\\" is worth reading if for no other reason than to witness this evolution within Moore, and to laugh at his few references to George W., as we know now, Moore's nemesis to come.\\"Downsize This!\\" is worth reading if for no other reason than to witness this evolution within Moore, and to laugh at his few references to George W., as we know now, Moore's nemesis to come. <br />	2005-09-23

Dr. Jerri Nielsen lived all three of these stories and writes about how they merged into one phenomenal journey.<br /><br />Some reviewers have been critical of Dr. Nielsen's motives or of the construction of her memoir. I cannot share their criticism-I found Nielsen's story to be an excellent telling of excitement, struggle, self doubt, and near death at the extremes of the Earth. I have lived high above the Arctic Circle; I know the wonder and awe one sees in the ice, the humbling realization that death awaits behind any mundane mishap. Despite this tension, day upon endless day passes beneath skies that are forever light or forever dark, an exotic sameness that captivates but provides little material for a full-length book. If anything, I congratulate Dr. Nielsen and her co-writer, Maryanne Vollers, for being able to relate Nielsen's story in such depth and detail, to have been able to sift through the routineness of life at South Pole Station for enough material to construct an interesting book.<br /><br />Dr. Nielsen was diagnosed with breast cancer during an Antarctic winter. We cannot blame the victim; Dr. Nielsen did not wish this condition upon herself. She did not want others to risk their lives on her behalf-others made that choice for themselves. Dr. Nielsen could not have stopped them if she had tried. The story of the courage and dedication of others is as important a theme in Dr. Nielsen's experiences as is her own internal fight to overcome loss and despair.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Ice Bound\\" for a very accurate and authentic description of life in polar places. Nothing takes the romance out of extreme places more than a true story well told. I think that her struggle against cancer would have to energize others suffering from the same condition, and I think that her children's alienation from her by a vindictive ex-spouse is a more common story than many may realize.the same condition, and I think that her children's alienation from her by a vindictive ex-spouse is a more common story than many may realize. <br />	2005-09-18

There are the usual expos&eacute;s of corporate and governmental corruption, they spew one after another like soot from an SUV's exhaust pipe, bringing on anger and then rage and then a feeling of helplessness, but Hightower includes stories of everyday people who have challenged and defeated the corporations, how they did it, where they did it, and how you can join up to do it yourself. This is refreshing; it's good to know that people can-and do-still win. And then there's the humor, that essential Texasness that was endearing before our current president grabbed his carpet bag and moved to Washington (note: our president is from Connecticut, not Texas, so, historically, this metaphor is accurate).<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: public corporations have only one goal-to make money. Nothing wrong with that except that corporations are not people and cannot be threatened with jail time if they transgress. Are you a noble CEO? Do you want to do right in the world? Well, if Wal-Mart tells you to close all of your American factories and move your production to the sweatshops of China, and you refuse, and your stock falls because Wal-Mart won't buy your products anymore, and your shareholders ask for your termination, so you close all of your American factories and move your production to the sweatshops of China, are you a bad person? Well yeah, but it's the system that led you to it, like the poverty that makes some poor people steal. Laws haven't stopped poor people from stealing, and laws, even if enforced, won't stop CEOs from stealing either. What we have to do is manage poverty through government programs and manage corporate theft through government regulation.<br /><br />\\"We the People\\", conservatives. Our government was created before you were born, so just suck it up.do is manage poverty through government programs and manage corporate theft through government regulation.    \\"We the People\\", conservatives.

There was the potential here for some deep social commentary, some spelunking into the red-state world of the working poor. Unfortunately though, Letts keeps her story up on the surface-she seldom allows her characters to descend into the grit and grime of reality, to work down there where irreconcilable circumstances demand harsh, irreconcilable choices. Instead, \\"Where the Heart Is\\" reads like a fairy tale. Each character is striped with scars and wounds that won't heal, but these wounds cannot pull them down from their states of grace. Letts' characters are often taxed, but never desperate.<br /><br />The entirety of the story itself is a metaphor for the stoic solidity of middle-America, the very core and beating heart of the nation, where our authenticity is preserved through the daily struggles and frugal dreams of everyday people. In this regard, Letts has told a great story, but like fulfilling all of the items on a creative-writing-class checklist, she has compiled a cast of characters with out-of-the-mainstream names, endowed each character with a personality quirk, and has employed florid analogy throughout. Her dialog skips along cleanly without inflection; without idiom. Everything feels a little too manufactured-a little too Hollywood.<br /><br />Still though, the themes are authentic and the settings are real enough. The story has enough unique elements to make it an entertaining read, just don't look for deep emotional connections.	2005-09-15

Many reviewers have trounced this book thoroughly, but I won't be so harsh-every writer has to start somewhere, and \\"Digital Fortress\\" still makes a passable airplane/airport book. Readers will recognize the themes that Brown has used in every one of his books: boy/girl protagonists aroused from their routines at the last minute to be sent on a quest, the significance of which isn't realized until the evil bad guy-assassin shows himself; a conspiracy from the highest levels, and conspirators whose nefarious plans begin to cascade out of control as the unwitting protagonists expose the deception. This is formulaic niche stuff-nothing wrong with that as long as the reader sticks to the paperback editions and avoids investing in the hardcover editions.<br /><br />Where Brown struggles is in writing life into his characters. With the exception (in my opinion) of a couple of the characters in his second novel, \\"Deception Point\\", all of Brown's characters are flat devices for moving his plot along. While Brown's researchers have dug up plenty of tidbits for him to use in his plots, his books have none of the sophistication and depth of a le Carre or a Ludlum. All of the elements are present, but Brown either lacks the skill or the discipline to pull all of the elements together into a sophisticated story. The plot of \\"Digital Fortress\\" is silly, a Much Ado About Nothing, really, but he does manage to keep the tension high enough to distract the reader from the implausibility of his plot. If you are interested in following Brown's career or have a long layover at the airport, read \\"Digital Fortress\\". Otherwise, pass.	2005-09-13

I know that I am going to take a beating over this review, but with the exception of just a few scenes, I did not enjoy this book very much. I had been tempted to take on Patrick O'Brian`s Jack Aubrey novels for quite some time because I had heard that O'Brian had masterfully recreated the sailing period of the 18th and 19th centuries. I began with \\"The Far Side of the World\\" because of the recent movie, not that I had seen the movie but because a friend had seen it and gave me the book as a gift. I had no preconceptions, therefore, only misgivings about beginning with one of the middle books in the series.<br /><br />Despite these misgivings, I found that \\"The Far Side of the World\\" could be read as a stand alone novel. There are plenty of references to earlier adventures, but O'Brian encapsulates his plot such that these earlier adventures do not drive the current plot. The issues I have with the book are the antique language O'Brian uses (though I acknowledge that the use of antique language sets the period and imbues the book with authenticity; nevertheless I would finish page after page and have no idea what I had just read) and O'Brian's choppy transitions from scene to scene. This transition device moves the story along, but has the reader leaping from one important scene set below decks toward another scene set above decks several weeks later toward yet another scene set upon an island several weeks further on. I could hold on to no real sense of the passage of time, and sometimes these \\"scene leaps\\" would land in the middle of dialog-who is speaking, and to whom? While the main characters are fully developed-Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin-secondary characters are introduced and discarded in unsatisfying ways. This may have been the reality of the nautical life of the time, but for me it was tedious storytelling. I found the ending to be entirely anticlimactic.<br /><br />I know that many readers are very fond of this series, and if I had been able to find a way to immerse myself into O'Brian's style I'm sure that I would have felt the same way. Perhaps it was a mistake not to begin the series with \\"Master and Commander\\".

The day after the 2004 Presidential Election, the London Daily Mirror ran a cover photo of George W. Bush with this title and directed readers to the various pages in the magazine which covered the \\"U.S. Election Disaster\\". Like the other half of the American population and the total of the human population outside of our borders, I felt dismayed and deeply depressed. Not only was I afraid for our nation, but I felt a deep sense of betrayal by half of the American people. How could this have happened? Were Conservatives really this hell-bent to return us to the semi-serfdom of the 19th century? I just couldn't get into their minds; I couldn't understand how so many people (even members of my own family) could betray the Republic and the legacies of the great, great men and woman who had fought and fought and fought to make the United States the shining light in the world. And then I read Thomas Frank's \\"What's The Matter With Kansas?\\" Now I understand.<br /><br />In order to understand the neo-conservative victory in 2004, we have to understand propaganda and the reasons that propaganda works. Frank analyzes the conservative propaganda machine in great detail, using his home state for examples of how the progressive ideal can be so easily hijacked by shrewd propagandists. The Nazis secured Germany by manufacturing an enemy whom they could lambaste without fear of reprisal. The conservatives have done it here by convincing their electorate that all conservatives are victims of a left-wing plot to corrupt their lives. Conservative propagandists have moved victim mentality from daytime schlock television into the mainstream, somehow convincing conservative voters that it is the left-wing that has taken their jobs, lowered their incomes; ruined their schools and communities. We all thought that the American people were smarter than this, but Thomas Jefferson didn't-this is why he was such a proponent of public education and the Electoral College. Let \\"the People\\" popularly elect senators and the president? Are you kidding?<br /><br />\\"What's The Matter With Kansas\\" is an excellent exploration into both the sociology and psychology of popular politics. Frank documents his conclusions very well, with 40 pages of notes and a comprehensive index, and writes in a down-home voice that is often humorous or nostalgic, but is always focused. While conservatives will probably flay this book as \\"left-wing bias\\", it is not conservatives whom Frank is trying to educate, but rather liberals and moderates who, I have to believe, still make up a greater percentage of the American electorate.larly elect senators and the president?

The big question is: Did Clive Cussler really write this sell-out of a once great series? Or is Clive Cussler just a publisher's fiction, like V.C. Andrews? At the core of it, I just cannot make sense of this ridiculous book. Not only is it so poorly written that I, like another reviewer, actually winced as I came across passage after passage of hokey dialog and amateur metaphors, but its plot devices are so over the top that raising the Titanic-now known to lay in pieces on the ocean floor-seems a more reasonable proposition. Quantum teleportation? Seriously? And this science-fiction device is only used to move some super-slick oil, like a 1970s gas mileage additive, from a secret lair into a mysterious briefcase? To top it all off, the usual formulaic historical segue (there are two of them this time) seems to have absolutely nothing to do with the main story whatsoever; and the sudden appearance of Dirk's two fully grown children at the end of the book is nothing less than finger nails on a blackboard. It is as if the Dirk Pitt series is now a practice vehicle for up and coming ghost writers; a stable of wannabees whom the publisher allows to try out their skills, at a cheap price, within a series which has already established its market position. Berkley Publishing is like a real estate developer who invests heavily in a new project but loses interest or walks away after the ten-year return on investment has been achieved. I feel pity for those who purchased this rip-off in hardcover.<br /><br />This is the decline and fall of Dirk Pitt and Clive Cussler and Berkley Publishing.<br /><br />The decline began with \\"Sahara\\", where Cussler (or someone) invoked a sacred name from American history, Abraham Lincoln, for a corny conspiracy plot in which Lincoln didn't die at the Ford Theater, but was spirited away to Africa. Who's next, Jesus? Any time now I expect Dirk Pitt to unearth golden tablets in New York State and set off a new religion. But \\"Sahara\\" is also the first book in which Cussler began to insert himself as a character into the plot, a device driven either by a smothering excess of ego on Cussler's part, or an homage to Cussler by an under skilled ghostwriter. In \\"Valhalla Rising\\", this silly, unprofessional device goes further than it ever has before toward ruining a story which seemed as if it could not possibly fall further. And then the few pages toward the end where Dirk Pitt's mystery children suddenly show up-if Cussler is retired, or dead, or not a real person after all, Berkley, the publisher, could have ensured an endless, multi-generational fan base with the addition of Dirk Pitt's children. A whole book could have been dedicated to the plot of Dirk's offspring, and we would have purchased it eagerly; indeed, we have been waiting for this for years.

Some of the criticisms I have read may have grown from these translation problems, or may be due to the peculiar structure of the novel because, secondly, \\"Blindness\\" is not written in a traditional format: it neither uses names for its characters nor quotations for the dialog. This is confusing at first, but as another reviewer has already remarked, these grammatical devices brilliantly insert the reader into a world where everyone has gone suddenly blind.<br /><br />The social commentary is intense, on par with Orwell, Huxley, Golding, or Ballard, and though it is a struggle to suspend disbelief in places, in those areas of social commentary it is not a struggle at all. \\"Blindness\\" is not for everyone; it is a tremendously thought provoking book written in an unorthodox style in order to make the most of its stark, black and white premise. The austere reality of the book harkens back to a time when social commentators did not spare their readers with flowery prose, yet \\"Blindness\\" is still completely modern in its topic and delivery. \\"Blindness\\" is a brilliant work which should insinuate its way onto school reading lists, but because of some disturbing sexual scenes, I doubt this will happen.	2005-08-17

I have not read anything by Baxter that I didn't think was great or extremely thought provoking (including this book) but I have been noticing the bastardization of great plots lately, all for the sake of marketing, I presume, such that seemingly unrelated stories can be hacked together into a profitable series (to see this trend run amok, read anything by John Ringo). It is hard for me to believe that authors are incorporating these devices into their books on their own.You can always tell when your favorite author has been co-opted-their books begin to be released in $25.00 hardcover editions (do you all remember when Weber's Honor Harrington books only came out in very affordable paperback editions?) Alas, though, in order to be able to accumulate enough reading material to wile away our hours, allowances must be made.<br /><br />For the first story in \\"Coalescent\\", the historical story, I became engrossed-I could not put the book down. This was a fascinating historical story with no apparent connection to the science-fiction genre (until the bastardization occurred), but I became caught up in the story and I didn't care that it wasn't science-fiction. Baxter recreates the soon-to-collapse world of Roman Britain brilliantly through the eyes of the young girl Regina, and all of the hints of collapse are right there, within Regina's childish interpretations of the events affecting her life. As the long, slow demise begins to spread across Britain, the reader can feel the despair of the era in a very tangible way. Baxter is highly skilled at creating and maintaining these emotions (just read or re-read \\"Titan\\", as Baxter's idealistic astronauts are confronted with the reality of long-distance space travel). George, the present-day ancestor of Regina, is going through his own spiritual demise-his need to connect with something larger than himself leads him into a journey of discovery. As he explores London's ancient Roman walls, the reader can easily place George's ancestor, Regina, along the same walls but in ancient times. There is a connection, albeit separated by almost two thousand years, which ultimately takes George to Rome. This is where the speculative science story begins to expand.<br /><br />My first advice to the reader would be to stop here and imagine-or write-your own ending. Too bad that this isn't the way things really work-we all know that we have to push ahead, to hope and pray that the author will come through for us. Baxter begins to flesh out his character, Peter, whom I began to call \\"Mulder\\" in my mind. Peter is an obsessed paranoiac, but his character could have still played a pivotal role. By this time, though, Baxter is heading toward his silly third story, the space adventure, and Peter becomes nothing more than a device to move the story along. The second story deals with emergent organizational systems and possible evolutionary destinations for Homo sap. This was fascinating stuff, and could have yet tied in satisfyingly with Regina's ancient story, but Baxter spends ¾ of the book developing Regina and her world-by the time his characters get to Rome, the story is being hurried along to make room for the space adventure to come. I have rewritten the book in my mind-it could have been a great story.<br /><br />The third story, the space adventure, is just plain silly.<br /><br />So what is the prognosis here? There are enough interesting elements in \\"Coalescent\\" to make it worth a look in paperback, but be prepared for an emotional let-down. The sequel to this book, \\"Exultant\\", seems to have no connection to the central characters in \\"Coalescent\\", and I will not read it (sorry Stephen). Perhaps the fan sites will start a movement to rewrite these great, but bastardized, stories so that we can enjoy them, covertly, on-line.not read it (sorry Stephen).

I am not educated in Egyptian history, so I cannot say which historical elements within River God are accurate or inaccurate; I can only say that I see no reason that ancient Egypt could not have had its own genius, its own Leonardo Da Vinci, and if this person had lived, this person would have probably closely resembled Taita the slave in Wilbur Smith's \\"River God\\".<br /><br />\\"River God\\" was such an enjoyable read that I lay in the high mountain meadows of the Hautes Alps for two days before I moved on, just so that I could finish the book. This is the first book by Wilbur Smith that I have read, but it won't be the last. The characters are so vividly written that one feels they must have been historical people; how else could they have been drawn so lifelike? Taita the slave watches over the lives of a young boy and a young girl who are destined to be together, but must first overcome politics, greed, jealousy and war while their nation moves forward into a troubling future. Throughout, Taita is there to mentor them and protect them if he can, sometimes at great peril, but his skills in art and medicine and engineering give him an edge that helps him to survive and save the day as each misadventure unfolds. During this period in history, even the wealthy would have found their lives filled with sorrow, pain and death. Disease would have taken its toll, as would political disfavor and torture. Smith does not spare his characters from these challenges, and makes them all the more real for it.<br /><br />The book reads at a good clip-I found none of the long, flat passages that one often encounters in historical fiction. If anything, the ending moved too quickly, resolving itself in a satisfying way while leaving open the possibility of a sequel.	2005-08-04
US	38490712	R2TMVIR2CP4WJM	0425161242	528653838	Chromosome 6	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Coma This Is Not	Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?<br /><br />Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.<br /><br />Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.	2005-08-02

Nevertheless, Dan Brown has resurrected historical mysteries and has allowed them to play themselves out within the ancient city of Rome. I happened to have visited Rome shortly after reading the book and I found myself drawn to the sites Brown described, searching for the real-world clues that he described through fiction. Angels and Demons became a guidebook for me then as I retraced his characters' footsteps from piazza to piazza while vicariously reliving the plot of the book.<br /><br />Wow...Angels and Demons must be a pretty good thriller.<br /><br />It is. As with the Da Vinci Code, Brown's characters are a little flat, but his plot moves quickly and his descriptions of Rome recreate that city vividly within the pages of the book. Angels and Demons is good suspense for a quick read, but if you are planning a trip to Rome, Angels and Demons will create connections within your mind to the sites you visit, allowing those sites to become tangible realities rather than historical curiosities. Just remember though-Angels and Demons is fiction, not real.	2005-08-02

I enjoyed this book much more than \\"Angels and Demons\\" or the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", if only because he wrote his characters much more fully and believably. \\"Deception Point\\" is another \\"conspiracy\\" novel, but in this novel the conspirators are elements within the good old American government. His \\"bad guy\\" government agency is a little hard to swallow, and the character written as the president of the United States is a little improbable, but otherwise his plot moves at a good suspenseful clip and his characters are developed better than anything else I have read by this author.<br /><br />The real revelations in \\"Deception Point\\", though, are the technologies Brown describes. He writes in the beginning of the book that the technologies he describes exist today, and are, presumably, currently in use by our government. Conspiracy Theorists could launch a whole new wave of paranoia based upon some of the elements within this book, but I just enjoy a good suspense story from time to time.	2005-08-02

I'm sure that \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" was inspired by the success of the novels of Dan Brown, nevertheless \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" stands alone as an okay thriller in its own right, and utilizes themes that may be new to many readers.<br /><br />Russia had been ruled by the Czars for centuries, but WWI and the Bolshevik Revolution brought an end to imperial rule and the family of Czar Nicholas II was brutally murdered. Present-day Russia is chaotic: a land and a people searching for some sense of themselves. What is needed is a new Czar, a new Romanov Dynasty to bring some sense of order to the land and return pride to the Russian people. This idea is not a stretch, but powerful, greedy forces have established themselves in today's Russia, and their hands manipulate the process by which the new Czar will be selected. But what if one of Nicholas' children had survived the murder of the Romanov family? What if a secret society existed to protect that child and that child's descendants until the communists could be driven from power and the rightful heirs to the throne could be restored?<br /><br />\\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" has an interesting historical mystery combined with present-day suspense, and could lead those who are not familiar with Russian history into further study. In that case, I would recommend Robert K. Massie's \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\".	2005-08-02

Throughout \\"Ilium\\", one sees Homer and H.G. Wells, Poul Anderson and Isaac Asimov; the visions of these authors combined and expanded into a saga that is uniquely Simmons. \\"Ilium\\" was a very enjoyable read that swung back and forth from the hazy recollections of mythology to the stark reality of science. It is an Odyssey playing out within the Iliad while simultaneously incorporating H.G. Wells' future societies, Asimov's robotic morality, and Anderson's time chroniclers.<br /><br />All of the characters are complete and complex; they transcend time and space but ultimately come together in a way that is both believable and satisfying. The Narrator sprinkles earthy humor throughout, a device that keeps the reader grounded in the present and prevents \\"Ilium\\" from descending into fantasy. At over 600 pages in the paperback edition, the reader begins to wish that the plot didn't move so quickly or satisfyingly just so that the enjoyment could go on and on. The story arc travels full circle and ends in a satisfying way. I am a little depressed: I have finished \\"Ilium\\" but I want more. Wait a minute! I see the possibility of a sequel.

At least two movies were made about her, but movies scripts can seldom tell the whole story or portray history with accuracy because of the demands of drama and story arc. So while I thought that I had a fairly good understanding of the events of Karen Silkwood's death, I have learned from reading this book that there was so very much more to the story. Not only was Silkwood incredibly brave, but the lawyers who took on her case were equally so. In more than one instance, Dan Sheehan, the lead attorney, must tell his investigator, \\"You're about to be killed. I've been contacted by the White House...\\"<br /><br />From rural Oklahoma and an undereducated young working class woman whose cause was simply to improve the working conditions for the employees in a Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, arose what was possibly a conspiracy that could rival any international spy network: FBI, CIA, NSA, the White House, double agents, foreign powers, death threats, and more. How could such a simple woman as Karen Silkwood become involved in this level of intrigue? Richard Rashke did a masterful job of research, presenting the evidence in such a way that the reader can evaluate the evidence himself.<br /><br />If Silkwood's story were not true, this book would stand as spirited fiction and would make better reading than many a spy novel; but Silkwood's story is true and this book exposes the depth of corruption, greed, cover-ups, and abuse of power that our government practiced in the 60s and 70s, and probably still practices today. The difference then though, is that exposing the government's actions led to reform-today, no one seems to care.<br /><br />For updated information about Karen Silkwood, read Kirk Ward Robinson's \\"Founding Courage.\\"led to reform-today, no one seems to care.<br /><br />For updated information about Karen Silkwood, read Kirk Ward Robinson's \\"Founding Courage.\\"	2005-05-19

When you see an eagle or a falcon or a hawk, you can than k Rachel Carson. Her book \\"Silent Spring\\" incited action almost immediately against irresponsible pesticide use, including DDT, and launched an ecology movement that led to the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. This is quite an accomplishment for an author of natural history books; Rachel Carson must have been larger than life, practically immortal, in order to have pulled this off.<br /><br />But...as Linda Lear documents in extraordinary detail, Rachel Carson was entirely mortal, and all too human, and was not lacking in the faults most of us possess. Success came to Carson late (almost too late), but Carson's love of nature and her dogged determination allowed her to complete what is, perhaps, the most important book of the 20th Century before she succumbed to breast cancer. Lear's detail is incredibly deep; over and again she recounts instances from Carson's life that seem trivial and mundane until the reader feels bogged down in the excess of it. But this detail is critical, because Carson's life itself seemed mundane and trivial, that is until the last decade of it. Carson was a regular person-she was no superstar-and Lear's depth of detail is necessary in order to explain Carson's journey from a less-than-middle-class upbringing to government functionary to the preeminent nature writer of her time. Carson's life evolves slowly and ends tragically; she never married and she never had children-it is almost as if she was born to deliver \\"Silent Spring\\" at exactly the right moment in history, when it was needed the most, and then pass on.<br /><br />In \\"Witness for Nature\\", Linda Lear does not allow Rachel Carson to become a cardboard icon of an earlier time; Lear recreates Carson as a complete person with loves and fears and faults. Carson's greatness rises on its own from Lear's writing.<br /><br />For more information about Rachel Carson, also read Kirk Ward Robinson's \\"Founding Courage.\\"ng Courage.\\"	2005-05-14

As for John Ringo...well, he started out great, but lately his work has been...erratic.<br /><br />The plot is fine; it takes Prince Rog where he needs to go, but the build up is tedious and interminably slow. When Roger says he wants to kill something, you think, \\"Please Roger, please kill something...\\", but alas, no action until the final third of the book. When things finally do take off, the pace is frenetic and confusing. What was the hurry? David Weber describes space battles brilliantly, but this one is confusing, with more acronyms flying than cruisers, carriers and shipkillers. And then, why must every Ringo book now include sexual abuse and rape? In my opinion, these themes were not necessary in order to heighten the tension and danger. The ending finds Prince Rog where one would expect him to be, but the ending does not quite wrap up satisfyingly. I have been under the impression that \\"We Few\\" would be the last book in the Prince Roger series, but the ending is too rushed and incomplete-another book will have to come along some day in order to provide closure for this story arc. I wish Baen would just put these books out in paperback: maybe then the mediocre stories wouldn't sting so badly.	2005-04-25

Racism was undoubtedly the reason, and perhaps this is why his book is so frustratingly short on detail.     As a quick romp through the Arctic, Henson wrote a good book: missing is any significant reference to racism, and the relationships between the various explorers, including Peary, are always positive. We know that Henson endured more than just the frigid arctic temperatures during the polar expeditions, but throughout his book he is the consummate gentleman; his narrative is understated and toned down to the gentlemanly pitch of the period. In this regard, Henson again shows his greatness because while it is obvious that he was subjected to abuse and humiliation, and while it is further evident that he was proud to have stood at the North Pole not only as an American, but also as a black man, Henson did not let his book become anything other than an account of an arctic expedition.    In his later years, Henson did finally speak out about many of the inequities under which he had struggled during the polar expeditions. These later revelations render \\"A Negro Explorer at the North Pole\\" virtually unusable as a primary reference beyond dates and times. Still, the book is written in Matthew Henson's voice, and is worth reading if only to know him better.

Though this book is titled improperly, it is still an engaging reference for the entire war, and would serve as a good introduction for the student who is learning about the Greco-Persian War for the first time.<br /><br />Ernle Bradford provides some interpretations that seem perfectly reasonable in light of his sources, specifically Herodotus and Plutarch. He weaves through Herodotus' innate bias to remove the tyrant and barbarian images from Xerxes and the Persians. Bradford also provides more plausible figures for the sizes of the various armies and navies by pointing out possible mistranslations of Herodotus, and by showing the limits of the landscape in providing food and water for large armies-in other words, Xerxes \\"million\\" man army would have been too large to feed; the actual figure is probably closer to 100,000.<br /><br />The text reads well-not dry-and Bradford constructs his chapters in such a way that each builds satisfyingly upon the last until the epic Battle of Plataea and the final defeat of the Persians. Annoyingly though, he makes constant references to World War II and the oratory of Winston Churchill. A much more accurate historical analogy is probably the Texas Revolution and the Battle of the Alamo.	2005-04-15

Prevas has made the journey himself many times, so he is able to give accurate site reports of the various routes Hannibal is speculated to have taken over the Alps. Hannibal traveled with an army of tens of thousands of soldiers and as many as 37 war elephants. As Prevas makes his case for a crossing at Col de la Traversette, the reader is held in awe of Hannibal's tenacity and daring.<br /><br />\\"Hannibal Crosses the Alps\\" is just the right size for the reader looking for a good snapshot of the Second Punic War: the book is not too short, but neither does it drown in detail. There is a good chronology in the front, some maps and photos, an extensive bibliography, and an index. More remarkable, though, is Prevas' case for Hannibal's route. The actual route has been lost to history, but Prevas has hiked though the region, and he painstakingly compares the natural features he observed to those recorded in Polybius and Livy. His conclusions are hard to refute, and baring future archeological finds, I believe his conclusions are very sound. His book will also help the reader of Durham's novel fit what is known into Durham's fictional account.	2005-04-02

Hannibal's story of war, struggle, revenge, and hate is one of the most fascinating and evocative stories in human history, but Hannibal's story comes to us through only a couple of classical sources: the larger events of the period are known, but the details passed into antiquity after the Romans razed the city of Carthage and Carthage's entire culture during the Third Punic War. To know Hannibal, then, we must resort to fiction. Several authors have taken on Hannibal's life, including John Maddox Roberts and Ross Leckie. Their books are good reading, but Durham has taken Hannibal's story to an entirely new level, with a fully developed, multi-dimensional Hannibal character, and supporting characters who become so real we feel that they must be historical people rather than fictional characters.<br /><br />Remember as you read that this is a fiction-Durham has developed his characters so well that it is hard to know what is fact and what is not. This is the first issue I have with the book. While this is a novel and should not be considered a historical reference, Durham does not include the usual pages of explanations and qualifiers: he does not tell the reader what he has invented. The reader unfamiliar with the history of the period probably will not care about this, but they risk passing on what they have read as fact. Secondly, Durham starts to run out of steam toward the end. Events that covered fifteen years are compressed into a period of time that cannot be calculated until a single sentence in which Durham mentions how long Hannibal had been separated from his son. Durham pours so much into Hannibal's early story that it seems as if Durham was just worn out by the time the story comes to an end. Read the book anyway-it is still very enjoyable-and remember that at the end of this book, Fortune and Fate were not yet done with Hannibal-he would go on to live for another nineteen years or so in a life so tragic that Shakespeare couldn't have written it more so. This later period of Hannibal's life could warrant its own book.d remember that at the end of this book, Fortune and Fate were not yet done with Hannibal-he would go on to live for another nineteen years or so in a life so tragic that Shakespeare couldn't have written it more so.

As with his \\"In Search of the Old Ones\\", David Roberts has taken on another topic that combines a fascinating history with the outdoor experience of the southwest. David Roberts does this better than anyone else except, perhaps, Craig Childs. But while Craig Childs writes marvelously of his outdoor experiences in the canyons of the southwest, Roberts weaves in important historical topics that reveal the American southwest as more than just a backcountry experience, but an experience of the human species.<br /><br />The Pueblo Revolt is an important event, not only to American history, but to human history as well: the Puebloans did indeed drive the Spanish out of the southwest for a time, an event that was never repeated by any other North American native people. Roberts' narrative is engaging and personal: he discovers that, three centuries later, hard feelings still exist between natives and hispanics, yet he is sensitive to all sides and tells the story without bias. He protects Native place names out of respect for native wishes, and he struggles to get modern Puebloans to drop their veil of secrecy to reveal the history that they have kept hidden from the rest of the world. He is not entirely successful in this regard, and must rely upon (as previous historians have also) Spanish documents for his primary sources. Many (not all) of the Puebloan peoples will not share the oral histories that have been passed down to them, as if they are not, themselves, Homo sapiens and a part of the human history of the planet. This is a real shame since their self-imposed apartheid could ultimately doom their rich cultures (and some languages as well) to nothing more than enigmatic footnotes in human history.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Roberts has navigated through these challenges to write a comprehensive, on-the-ground history of the Pueblo Revolt that will entertain as well as inform.that will entertain as well as inform. <br />	2005-03-14

This was obvious in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, where Diamond cast aside long-standing beliefs of cultural superiority with in-depth research and great storytelling to create an argument that even the most conservative and belligerent couldn't refute.<br /><br />With Collapse, Diamond takes the large view again to explain how and why societies collapse (in some cases, societal implosion might be an even better description). Those of us who understand natural science and ecosystems are already onboard with the causes of collapse, but it is often (if not always) difficult to make a case that many elements of our society will accept. Diamond is brilliant: one of his early chapters discusses the mystery of Easter Island, and who isn't fascinated by a good mystery? He moves on to the Vikings in America and Greenland; again, a topic bound to entrance even the most conservative reader. Going forward, he discusses the Maya and the Anasazi, and then he springs his trap: most of the second half of the book deals with environmentalism and sustainability. Among the greatest causes of societal collapse are deforestation, resource depletion, pollution, the availability of fresh water, and soil salinity-all of the bad things that environmentalists have been warning us about since Rachel Carson had the courage to step up in the fifties and sixties.<br /><br />Some societies did collapse because of warfare and strife, but more often than not, societies collapsed because of environmental degradation or violence that resulted from environmental degradation. As the reader learns about Easter Islanders, Vikings, and Anasazi, Diamond weaves in the environmental impacts that led to the demise of these cultures; the conservative is lured in until denial is no longer an adequate response. Collapse may be a book that can finally sway anti-environmentalists into some kind of positive action; they may at least sell their SUVs or try to recycle something.

Botkin is not copying the styles of other writers, he is simply exploring similar topics, but from a different perspective-that of an ecologist.<br /><br />Through twenty-eight essays, and a poignant account of the ecology of his wife's battle with cancer, Botkin approaches each problem-whale hunting, sustainable salmon fisheries, forest management, endangered species, and more-with a completely open mind. He will not accept dogmatic explanations, and his inquisitiveness leads him on a life-long hunt to try to solve some-any-ecological problem. He writes in humorous tones of the slings and arrows of the idealist ecologist, and wonders how, as a forestry expert, he wound up with jobs trying to learn how long whales sleep (no one knew), or how much food an elephant ate (no one knew), or how many leaves are on a tree (no one knew). He despairs that he will ever make a positive contribution to ecology: \\"Ever the optimist, I had readily accepted the opportunity to work on the salmon issue. Perhaps this time I can really make a difference...\\" In each essay it appears as if his contribution is minor, until one takes in his body of work, over his long career, to discover that his contribution was actually enormous and invaluable.<br /><br />The reader of natural history will enjoy Botkin's experiences and insights, but more importantly, those unfamiliar with ecology or natural history (reds, you know who I mean) will learn a great deal without feeling threatened.	2005-02-16

The rest of us make progress one step at a time, but the geniuses allow us to make leaps that keep us from getting too bogged down in dogma. Beethoven was such a genius, as was Fisher and Einstein and Newton and Shakespeare and da Vinci-and Alexander. In each of their own ways, these geniuses were looking for order in chaos. It so happens that Alexander's genius was for war; he could visualize war in his mind the way Beethoven could visualize musical notes, and it is natural that he would use his genius to bring order to what he saw as chaos in the world. One can debate whether Alexander was a good guy or not, but this debate is irrelevant: Alexander lived; Alexander conquered; Alexander died-what is important is to learn from him.<br /><br />Steven Pressfield comes with another novel of ancient warfare, but this time it's different: he literally steps into the mind of Alexander, and he lets Alexander tell his own story. I found myself in awe of Pressfield's skill; I became immersed and could believe that I was actually reading Alexander's words. I could almost \\"see\\" what Alexander saw at Guagamela; I felt that I knew how his mind worked. I could follow his descent into madness; I could trace his rationalizations, the ways in which he justified his actions to himself; I could feel his hurt and despair.<br /><br />The Virtues of War is not a linear novel; rather, it is a treatise upon warfare told with astounding authenticity. Throughout are the thoughts, feelings, fears and doubts of Alexander wound together with the Virtues to create a story. Those of us interested in history-but not brilliant in that regard-will find this book an excellent way to connect with that period.	2005-02-02

But the really interesting discovery is that the truth is much more evocative than the myth.<br /><br />A biography of any one of these men would be a quite a job by itself, but William Davis has written three meticulously researched biographies and has combined them into the definitive history of the Alamo. Don't be deterred by the length of this book; serious researchers will appreciate the detail, but for the rest of us Davis writes in a smooth and satisfying style. Once their mythology is stripped away, Bowie, Crockett and Travis come to life as real men, and we follow their fascinating lives as their paths lead them toward their fate. We become immersed in their stories, as if they were characters in literature.<br /><br />If you could only read one book about the Alamo, Three Roads to the Alamo would be your best choice.	2005-01-27

Every indication is that he arrived at this place accidentally, but that once he recognized his own pop-culture status he took advantage of it and nurtured it at every turn. His Narrative, therefore, must be read with a certain amount of skepticism nevertheless it is still valuable as an historical record.<br /><br />The narrative is a journey from start to finish; true Homeric stuff. He describes his journey into adulthood in pre-Mark Twain style, then his journey as an adventurer in the military, his journey across the state of Tennessee with his family, and finally his journey into politics. There may be many embellishments within his narrative, but considering the period in which it was written (while he contemplated a much larger political career) the topics he chose to describe actually seem prosaic and understated, as if he were deliberately trying to avoid bragging about himself. In this light, perhaps the Narrative is more accurate than is generally assumed. The Narrative may have been ghost-written by someone else, but there is enough Crockett in it to give it legitimacy. His jabs at Andrew Jackson are quaintly hilarious, but they are also true. In this pre-Alamo period of his life, his willingness to take a stand against Jackson might be the bravest thing he ever did.<br /><br />Lastly, the language itself is fascinating. The Narrative may be laced with over-the-top phrases such as, \\"knocked his trotters out from under him\\", but at the same time he writes, \\"if a fellow is born to be hung, he will never be drowned...\\" This is classic southern wisdom, words I have heard with my own ears in the mountains of eastern Tennessee, so Crockett's Narrative is either very authentic or was itself the basis for an evolving southern culture. In this way, the Narrative should be considered classic American literature.<br /><br />For more information about David Crockett, also read Kirk Ward Robinson's \\"Founding Courage.\\"ge.\\"	2005-01-14

Her scenes of outdoor survival are unequalled. After Leave No Trace, I thought that no novel could ever again capture such an absolute edge-of-life survival situation or the grit necessary to survive it, but Cry Last Heard pulls it off; Nyala's two for two.<br /><br />SAR tracker Tally Nowata has issues that have nothing to do with what's about to happen to her. While she goes through the fight of her life, she has to deal with those issues as well and you want to say, Jeez Nyala, give the gal a break, would ya. So, if a reader gets this invested in a character it means that the author has done a pretty good job of defining the character and bringing the character to life. Nyala has done that. As I read Cry Last Heard, I was already thinking about how Nyala might take her characters into another book, hoping that it comes soon.<br /><br />Like Leave No Trace, Cry Last Heard is a well-written, powerful story.	2005-01-04

This is one of those books you read and think everyone else understands but you because there really is a lot going on: there are a lot of characters, a wiley protagonist, and Portis got good blurbs on the back jacket. But I didn't get it, not this time. The characters are all classic Portis-wacky and larger than life yet still very real somehow-and the quest is classic Portis too, a journey into the jungle in search of an ancient Mayan codex, UFOs, space aliens, hippie outlaws, and runaway children. I mean, how can you go wrong with a plot like that?<br /><br />The dialog is not as snappy as other Portis novels, and the characters (so many of them this time that I couldn't keep up) did things for reasons that I wasn't able to follow. I suspect that with a second read, additional details will pop out to make Gringos more intelligible. So if I \\"get it\\" with a second reading, I'll dial back in and change my rating.	2004-12-29

Not only is the novel well constructed, but Toole's observations of society are especially profound. Two passages are quite memorable to me, \\"She didn't know she was the only thing I ever wanted to have that I thought I'd get,\\" and \\"They always had some time left over from their life to bother about other people...\\" Toole was obviously born with deep insight and the gift of writing it on paper; it is amazing that he had to struggle so despairingly to get his Confederacy of Dunces published.<br /><br />I read Confederacy some years ago. I enjoyed it, but I was fully unaware of Toole's back story at the time. After reading The Neon Bible (which I hadn't know about, and discovered quite by accident), I now know that we lost an important literary voice when Toole committed suicide in 1969.<br /><br />Unlike others, I cannot compare The Neon Bible and To Kill a Mockingbird-To Kill a Mockingbird, for me, is a different book in a completely different voice. The themes of youthful innocence are similar, but where Harper Lee's novel reads with elegance and grace, Toole's is grittier and darker. Regardless, his message is important. Many of us of a certain age remember the South he describes, and as I read I had memories popping out that I, at his age, would never have had the prescience to write about.	2004-12-20

These were our smallpox vaccinations, and for most of us, this was just another vaccination in a series of vaccinations we had to get because our parents made us. We later learned that entire American Indian populations had been wiped out by smallpox once the Europeans had introduced it to the new world. Smallpox hadn't existed in the Western Hemisphere before-Indians had no natural resistance to it-so they suffered horribly from the disease. This is what we were taught, but we were left with the impression that smallpox was really of little concern to us. We weren't taught that smallpox had been a devastating scourge of mankind for thousands of years, and that for many, contracting smallpox meant a slow, painful death.<br /><br />Richard Preston has written another great biological who-done-it in the same swift, hard-hitting style of The Hot Zone. The Demon in the Freezer is constructed like a suspense novel; it reads very well, and the story moves along at a good clip while exposing or documenting the bio-warfare research surrounding smallpox. Anthrax and Ebola even make an appearance, their own stories prove to be disconcertingly woven within the smallpox saga.<br /><br />In contrast to the Bio-weaponeers are the Eradicators, those teams of docs and biologists who stamped out smallpox in the 1970s. Their monumental work is all but forgotten by the lay public, and they never received any awards or prizes for their work. I think that one of Preston's main motivations for writing this book was probably to provide some recognition for the courage and determination of the Smallpox Eradication Teams. Their work has saved 2 million lives a year since the 1970s-they should at least have a lot of children named after them out there in the world.<br /><br />Bacteria and viruses, bioengineering, weaponized strains, terrorists-this is really scary stuff, but I choose not to be afraid.

Life is good when you are a dog in Pine Cove (or a fruit bat for that matter), but if you are a human resident, Pine Cove is about to get weird again. Again?<br /><br />Theo and Molly are back, and deal with the latest Pine Cove disaster in their own individual ways (he sucking bong, she slinging steel). Use your imagination-I won't spoil it-but the laughs come so hard that Christopher Moore's novel, Lamb, should be served up to the Vatican as serious gospel (and why shouldn't it?).<br /><br />Moore just gets better and better. The Stupidest Angel is hands down the funniest book I have ever read (well, recently anyway). Just in time for Christmas, and with a cute little angel on the cover, many a grandma will feel her garters slipping as she works her way through this book (and grandpa will be saying, \\"look at the size of that some @#$%^, but grandpa will deny liking the book to keep grandma happy, hint, hint-well an old guy can dream can't he?). Really though, Moore includes a good disclaimer (Author's Warning) in order to prevent grandma any serious harm, so unless she really is interested in a Christmas book containing cusswords, cannibalism, and people in their forties having sex, she should be safe enough. Enough of grandma, feed this book to the kids. When's the movie coming out? C'mon Moore, get busy, get us another book now. NOW!	2004-12-14

Many books and films depict the gray-coated Rebs as uncouth huns bent upon the destruction of a paternal and benevolent Union. Today, their symbols are reviled and their memory is denounced as if four states of the Confederacy weren't also Founding colonies themselves.<br /><br />Nashville 1864 is told from the point of view of a 12 year-old boy, but the narrative is suitable for adults as well. Imagine an American city occupied by an enemy army. We have to reach all the way back to the Revolutionary War period for a practical analogy, but that period is so far behind us it is difficult create a connection within our 21st Century minds. The Civil war, however, is much closer to us. Young people may not be able to empathize, but people in their late-forties and older will probably remember a grandfather or great grandfather who lived during that time, so for us the Civil War is still real. Nashville was occupied by the Union Army, and the bitterness from that occupation still shows up from time to time.<br /><br />Madison Jones' descriptions of the period and the emotion and the misery of war are vivid. When young Steven Moore's father tells him, \\"They have beat us, Steven\\", you can feel the agony and despair, and so throughout the book.<br /><br />There are many great Civil War novels, but Nashville 1864 should not be overlooked.	2004-12-07

Charles Portis continues to hold me in awe with his deadpan comic genius. His silly plots read humorously on the surface, and move at a good clip, but suddenly one realizes that there is so very, very much more going on.<br /><br />Where do cults come from and why do (presumably) rational people involve themselves in the nutty things? Portis' take on the topic spells it out in plain humor: an accidental encounter, an impressionable young man, the hangers on, the manipulators, and, gasp, the true believer who spawns a whole philosophy derived from the antics of a con man. Strangely enough, he begins to discern subtle truths about the nature of the universe. When the government gets involved things get sillier yet, but don't just write this off as fiction, we've all seen Congressional hearings; Charles Poris has got their number.<br /><br />Line your Charles Portis books up next to your Kurt Vonnegut-they make great companions.	2004-12-04

He is the man he is, regardless, slow to fight but ready to fight, honest, to a point, and rationalizing beyond that. He never internalizes, seldom jumps to conclusions, and just proceeds along the rightness of his course without question. He is a Faulknerian character distilled down to the basics, so unsophisticated he is hilariously honest.<br /><br />Norwood is a fast-paced comedy of the simpleton winning out in the end because his sights are so low he can't lose, and Charles Portis' social commentary should not be missed, but if you do, the dialogue alone is worth the read. And if the characters in Norwood seem too silly to be real? Well, I recognized them more than I care to admit.	2004-11-21

What is lacking in this book is not story or characters, but just the refined style we read in McDevitt's later novels. The Hercules Text is apparently out-of-print. Perhaps now that McDevitt has become fairly successful, The Hercules Text will be reprinted.<br /><br />Some reviewers compare The Hercules Text to Sagan's Contact, but I have to disagree: the two books resemble each other only insofar as each explores the ramifications and consequences of an extra-terrestrial communication. Contact explored much larger themes, in keeping with Carl Sagan's genius and vision. McDevitt writes a much more down to earth-and, in truth, more plausible-story that examines what would happen politically if an extra-terrestrial communication were discovered. The characters are not larger than life; they are not infused with Sagan's optimism. McDevitt's characters are scientists, bureaucrats, and politicians whom we can not only imagine, but whom we observe every day. The Hercules Text is, I believe, pretty close to what would actually happen.<br /><br />And what happens is not grounds for optimism. The story is a little dated-the Soviet Union still exists-but the story would work just as well by substituting any of the other crazy, reactionary societies on the planet. The paranoia and hubris McDevitt writes into the American government is not a stretch either: just look at the behavior of the administration we have now.<br /><br />If you believe that our species has successfully navigated through the Age of Reason toward some new intellectual enlightenment, then The Hercules Text should change your mind; if anything, we are still living in Sagan's Demon Haunted World.	2004-11-21

What is this novel about? Gosh, who knows, but I swear I see The Odyssey, The Heart of Darkness, and A Confederacy of Dunces all wound together into a tale of silly nonsequiturs that make potent social commentaries akin to Vonnegut.<br /><br />An enjoyable read.	2004-11-10

Someone described this story as quirky, and I agree.<br /><br />This is not a very long book, and there is no telling what might have been lost in the English translation, but I felt that the characters had become real enough, and that the story moved along quite well. I would have liked to learn more about the relationship between Julia and Cesar, and I think the story would have benefited if it had been drawn out a littler further, but overall I found it to be an entertaining piece of fiction with undertones that required some thought.

He quotes Al Gore as saying, essentially, that our environmental problems now exceed our political ability to solve them. This is a deeply disturbing statement, so McKibben profiles a pair of cities in Brazil and India where sustainability and quality of life movements have taken hold and are actually succeeding. The implications are obvious: if two Third World cities can pull this off despite long odds, both political and environmental, then why can't we?<br /><br />McKibben's studies of Curitiba, Brazil, and Kerala, India are both informative and uplifting, containing concrete examples of what creative thinking and political courage can achieve. We long, then, for a chapter or so in which these examples are applied to American urban centers; we long for a roadmap of possibilities applied to our culture of greed and consumerism. We long for an idea-or even the hint of an idea-we can use to break our cycle of destructive consumption. Instead, McKibben returns to his beloved Adirondacks and editorializes about the need for community, local economies, and so on. He demonstrates (I believe correctly) that sustainable agrarian communities beget sustainable wild lands and open space as well as a healthier human psyche. Trouble is, though, succeeding on this small scale will not make a dent in the larger problem.<br /><br />McKibben does not use this book to explore a more global vision. The seeds are there, but once the harvest begins he falls back upon his mountains and the good, community life one is often able to achieve when living on an urban income in a rural area. He begins to proselytize and sound more like a politician: we need to do this, and we should do that-these are obvious goals, but how do we get there? McKibben's Jeffersonian ideals are just that, ideals, and the idealistic will make them work. What we need now is a program of ideas that can build toward a sustainable world while countering the effects of the tragedy of the commons.<br /><br />Despite this, McKibben's work is vitally important and should be read. His body of work will one day define our era.What we need now is a program of ideas that can build toward a sustainable world while countering the effects of the tragedy of the commons. <br /> <br />Despite this, McKibben's work is vitally important and should be read.

We believe the Revolutionary War and the Founding Fathers to be sacred; they are beyond reproach. The truth is tough to take, but as Ray Raphael explains in great detail, the embellishment of any individual act of heroism during the Founding period of our nation cannot detract from the hundreds or thousands of acts of heroism that went on daily but just didn't make it into the history books. Often, the embellishments or myths that have evolved around a particularly famous event actually serve to portray that event as less exceptional than it really was. Many episodes from the Founding have been mythologized not from a desire to cover up the truth, but to convert what was a complex struggle into streamlined stories that could be passed down to children. This is why we must always be skeptical of oral traditions that are assumed to be fact: They are going to have been embellished; it is impossible for them not to have been. They may tell a great story or pass on an important moral, but allowing them to become dogma only conceals the truth.<br /><br />Despite its flippant cover, Founding Myths is not light reading. Raphael does examine a few of the more recognized Founding stories, but he writes as if he is on a crusade, and before long he is delving deeply into the characters and motivations of the Founding Fathers themselves. He cites his sources, and I am sure he has done his research, but his interpretations are completely egalitarian: There seems to be no room in his worldview for individual impetus or catalysis. If any individual Founder acted in a particularly prescient or heroic way, he could only have done so because his constituents ordered him to. The Patriots rose up as one, in other words, the Founding Fathers were simply pushed to the front to do the bidding of the masses. Well, sure, sometimes, but our Revolution didn't go the way of the French Revolution, and the Founding Fathers are the reason.<br /><br />This is an important book for those studying American history, but be prepared for some rambling and some egalitarian bias.idn't go the way of the French Revolution, and the Founding Fathers are the reason.<br /><br />This is an important book for those studying American history, but be prepared for some rambling and some egalitarian bias.	2004-10-09

Stephen Baxter has gone much further than even geologic time; he has written a book in genetic time. In this frame of reference, the creation of mountain ranges, the cutting of canyons and plateaus, the movements of continents, and the formation of inland seas and oceans are merely single frames in a much longer film, and individual lives flash by too quickly to register.<br /><br />Yet life is the protagonist, and Baxter is able to demonstrate a continuum of existence, from 65 million years ago through 500 million years from now, by slowing his film down periodically to focus upon individual lives, lives connected through time by their DNA. These vignettes are well crafted, demonstrating the adaptive pressures upon species and their resultant evolution, without anthropomorphizing or describing any kind of \\"plan\\" or progression toward complexity or consciousness. Evolution is random, haphazard, a simple exploitation of the current environmental niche...and a lot of luck.<br /><br />Baxter's characters, sprinkled across 565 million years, seem so real and interesting that he could write entire books about each of them individually, and these books would not be boring. He is a little long-winded in places, and some of his more speculative chapters will raise eyebrows, but excess verbiage works within the scope of the story, and Baxter acknowledges his speculative leaps. In the afterword, Baxter is clear that Evolution is a work of fiction that should not be used, in any regard, as a text on this topic, however, for those who cannot get their minds around genetic time, Evolution is a valuable and entertaining tool.	2004-10-03

Zacks' depth of research and attention to detail fully immerses the reader in the period. It is the late 17th Century, the American Republic is, as yet, still two generations away. The British Empire consists only of a tentative foothold in Bombay, scurvy is still the scourge of sea travel, and ships are steered at the rudder rather than via the more familiar wheel.<br /><br />Some readers may be overwhelmed by the level of detail Zacks includes, but without this detail The Pirate Hunter would have been little more than a minor work; a hobby topic. I found Zacks' style of writing to be quick and quirky, while his construction of historical events read like an adventure novel. The reader completes The Pirate Hunter with not only a deep knowledge of the life and motivations of Captain Kidd, but also a strong understanding of this period in history.	2004-09-22

Who would have know that a topic as esoteric as the 19th century English of eastern American coastal marshes could be so interesting, and that such a small book could deliver so much information? One learns the correct usage of the word \\"creek\\", the difference between a \\"gutter\\" and a \\"guzzle\\", the etymology of \\"schooner\\", and a detailed description of the elusive \\"gundalow\\". John Stilgoe provides some great comparisons of the unabridged dictionaries of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, as well.<br /><br />\\"Shallow Water Dictionary\\" is written as a narrative, a lament for the loss of words from dictionary English, arrived at while the author pilots his rowboat, \\"Essay\\" (A pretty enough boat, then, with lines more gentle than a skiff...), through the saltwater marshes of Massachusetts.<br /><br />Don't be put off by its small size; lovers of the English language will find this book to be a good reference that is also enjoyable to read.	2004-09-13
US	38490712	R3BFFBIGBA0DE0	0812579569	74115197	Domain (The Domain Trilogy)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Von Daniken Revisited	First, there are those who believe that humanity cannot achieve great things without some form of divine or extraterrestrial assistance, yet we have the Parthenon, the 9th Symphony, the Declaration of Independence, and a Theory of Relativity. So why is it so hard for people to accept that we could also build pyramids and understand the movements of the constellations?<br /><br />That said, Steve Alten has created a fairly interesting plot for a fantasy novel. He has doubtlessly done a lot of painstaking research, which is why it is almost possible to suspend disbelief. The book starts out slow, with a lot of political and academic intrigue, then picks up and moves at a pretty good clip, and then...over the top, way over the top. Alten must resort to the metaphysical in order to pull it all together. A little more finesse with the final scenes could have made the book enjoyable.<br /><br />Alten skips back and forth through history, always a satisfying device, but, annoyingly, he writes in the present tense, which is distracting. The hardcover edition I read had more typos than I have ever seen in a published work. I could recommend Domain as a pocket-book distraction for a long airplane flight, but the ending is not satisfying enough to make me want to read any of the sequels.	2004-09-11
US	38490712	RU8XV6IPXUCYR	044653059X	686971090	Beyond Infinity (Benford, Gregory)	Books	2	7	9	N	Y	Benford's Vision Doesn't Translate	The idea is brilliant: a billion years into the future, many successive species of Homo have evolved, made their mark on the galaxy, then passed into extinction. Now humanity is represented by an effete, geneticly engineered species which have cloned an earlier species called \\"Originals\\" (possibly Homo Sap)to restore the ecology of Earth. In space, huge organic ships ply the space lanes while the Earth and the Solar System plunge toward an orbit of the galactic core (these orbital mechanics were achieved by a much earlier species). Now comes a multi-dimensional bad guy that wants to destroy all of the Originals.<br /><br />Why? Who knows.<br /><br />This is where the book begins to struggle. Benford's ideas are moving too rapidly,like the ideas we get just before sleep, ideas that we urgently write down before we forget. I can imagine his brain in overdrive as he tries to put this stuff on paper, however, his vision doesn't translate well and he leaves the reader lost in multi-dimensional confusion. His vision is vast, too vast for most of us. I could imagine a series of more compact books within this universe.<br /><br />I give this book 2 stars for its incredible concepts; subtract three stars for its confusing plot and jumbled narrative.	2004-08-24

The jacket art shows a variety of hominid forms as well as some futuristic machine forms, so I thought the book was a compact anthropology of the genus with, perhaps, some interesting speculation upon the future. What the book is instead is a philosophy in which Fernandez-Armesto cites his thesis that \\"humanity\\" as a concept can no longer be defined in unique terms: toolmaker, language user, culture creator--many species exhibit these traits, ergo, humanity is not so special after all.<br /><br />Well, I never thought humanity was so special, but I have always been able to recognize a human from other higher mammals. Matters of degree do not lend themselves easily to the need for hard edged truth, but matters of degree are what separate us from other higher mammals and futuristic machine intelligences, and matters of degree are enough.<br /><br />The book is worth a read once you understand what it is; Fernandez-Armesto cites many useful historical references. I would say, however, that there is one human trait he failed to explore, and that is evil. I have never observed deliberate evil in other animal forms, only humanity.	2004-08-21
US	38490712	R22QMLQ4U0JFZ2	0441010385	156336723	Hannibal's Children	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Hannibal Wins This Time	The Second Punic War went on for over a decade, yet here Hannibal prevails, and within a very short period of time Romans emigrate and reestablish themselves elsewhere. Within a century, the Romans are back, having mobilized a vast army from the hinterlands with which to recapture their beloved Seven Hills and exact revenge on Carthage.<br /><br />I liked this book overall, and will recommend it for fans of alternate history and ancient history. Despite a quick set-up, Roberts does go in to great detail in describing this Carthaginian/Roman world; after the conquest of Rome, Hannibal's Carthage grew magnificently, but also decadently. Roberts draws a very believable picture; one can imagine Carthage among the other ancient wonders of the world.<br /><br />The Romans, on the other hand, have maintained their martial culture, and it is this culture that has allowed them to remain cohesive in the wilderness. The detail here is also very satisfying, if somewhat brief. Young Scipio, descendant of the famous general, will lead armies against Hanno, descendant of Hannibal. From the standpoint of story, our minds superimpose these new characters with their famous ancestors: it is as if Scipio and Hannibal were being given another shot at it--an alternate, alternate history, if you will.<br /><br />But the book ends much too quickly, with a rushed final battle. A sequel is necessary. I would have preferred a much larger book, one that told the finale in much greater detail.	2004-08-18

Forty Signs of Rain begins a new trilogy about abrupt climate change. In the book (as in the real world) this is not some vague worry for the future, but something that is going on all around us right now, just waiting for a trigger event before things get really bad. In Forty Signs of Rain, the characters are real people living real lives. They respond to political, environmental, and domestic pressures that are identical to those we all witness every day, so Robinson's plot is very real and tangible throughout.<br /><br />Don't expect Hollywood disaster themes in this book, climate change isn't working that way. Rather, the characters get on with their lives and struggles while subtle hints of what's to come appear here and there. Throughout the book, the science is rock solid. The only criticism I have is that this is the first Robinson I have read in which the opening book clearly requires a sequel. Forty Signs of Rain does not stand alone unless your expectations are very low. Normally I resent this from authors and publishers, but Robinson is too good at what he writes; I will give him a break.	2004-07-23

I must applaud Brad Dimock's writing skill. He has written a book with the timbre and cadence of a Jon Krakauer about an episode of which we know very little. While Glen Hyde's life was well documented by his family, very little is known about Bessie Hyde or how the Hyde's marriage was holding up under the pressure of their Colorado River float. Despite this dearth of information, Dimock has succeeded in bringing Glen and Bessie to life. We care about these two people, who disappeared over 75 years ago, and we follow the scanty thread of facts that Dimock has been able to gather, hanging on to each clue in the hope of learning their fate even though we know from the beginning that the Hyde's were never found.<br />Sunk Without a Sound can stand side-by-side with the best of Jon Krakauer and David Roberts.	2004-07-11

I encourage Southbounders to use Wingfoot if for no other reason than the ATC book patronizingly entreats \\"would be southbounders\\" to beware of blackflies, etc. as if they are trying to discourage a southbound hike. But Wingfoot has a lot of great information, sometimes too much information, and the book is large and heavy as a result. I could have torn off the pages as I went, but I wanted an intact record of my hike. If Wingfoot would edit this book down to a more compact size, and include some decent maps, his book would be, without a doubt, the best out there.	2002-01-25
