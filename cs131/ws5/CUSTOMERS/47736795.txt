Borges's argument - and Buzzati's - appears to be with the nature of man. <br />Like Borges, Mr. Buzzati employs a relative simplicity of language to reveal and conceal the circularity and ineluctability of time and destiny. The longest story in the collection, ''Barnabo of the Mountains'', deals with the fate of a young man who funks his duty as forester and then lives on to the critical moment of reprise, only to discover that the honor he sought to recover has been absorbed in the undifferentiated wholeness of experience. <br />Another Borgesian device is the assumption that people and events are as well known to the reader as they are to the author. ''The inventor, the famous Aldo Cristofari'' is an invented inventor introduced with an air of universal familiarity. <br />Preoccupied chiefly with conscience and social decorum, the 14 tales could be described as parables, being short on narrative and long on moral suggestion. A middle-aged man flirts dangerously with the fantasies of childhood. Another story proposes that human imagination has as much to do with reality as any case-hardened fact. A story about a literary doppelg&quot;anger once again demonstrates that one must be careful what one wishes for. And so on...	2001-03-01

Though Conrad's vision is tragic (he might have said realistic), his tone         is often comic. His dense, convoluted prose, English uneasily qualified         by undercurrents of the Polish and French that were the author's earlier         languages, is sometimes obscure. Every writer knows that melodramatic expressions of despair about the         progress of composition can become a kind of fetish, relied on to ward         off the onset of a genuinely catastrophic blockage. But in Conrad's case,         despair seems to have been the condition for writing anything at all - a         state of affairs he did his best to exacerbate by making it a practice to         borrow money from publishers against books he had not yet written.  He was unlike most writers who spend the better part of their lives sitting in a         room, turning sentences around, he himself spent some 20 years gathering         experience and adventures as a sailor and explorer of strange, exotic         places. The &quot;shadowy country&quot; of inextinguishable desires and fears&quot;that shaped his fiction was not only a literary construct, but in many         cases grew out of an actual landscape whose emotional and physical         geography the author had explored himself. <br />This story is a vision of a man who knew that the real darkness lay not in the         jungles of the Congo, but within his own solitary heart...	2001-02-19
US	47736795	R230APGW6NA8ER	0872860000	235188271	Artaud Anthology	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Cruel World	Of all twentieth century dramatists, Antonin Artaud             is perhaps the most enigmatic. The facts of his             life are stark and austere, and his work is a             painful movement through many silences and journeys.<br />Even             the less initiated student of Artaud will know this writer as             someone who deals with uncomfortable and taboo subjects. Among             more established critics, too, Artaud continues to attract highly             polarised critical opinions. When faced with Artaud's works, the             critic's approach seems to be either resolutely textual, bracketing             off the human element and referring only to the language on the             printed page, or it is predicated on the notion that the biography of             the writer must be taken into account in showing how Artaud's texts             came to be written. In the first kind of reading, Artaud's texts are              dehumanized. In the second,             Artaud's works are bracketed off as symptoms of the dramatist's             deviant mental or spiritual state, and the labels that have been             attached to him (from gnostic to schizophrenic) are taken as             reliable pointers to his works. While textual readings offer a             definite advantage, in that they approach Artaud's writings without             preconceived ideas about the writer's life, aspects of Artaud's life,             in particular his scabrous attitude to the traditions of the literary             world, seem too important to leave out of account in any             discussion of the dramatist's works. Within Artaud's writings here, there             is a specific, reflexive relationship between art and life, the one             illuminating the other. One can see there is no convenient distinction to be made             between Artaud the man and Artaud the writer, he was one and the same, these writings are an ejoyable entrance into that sphere...	2001-02-19

He is released from a clinic in the hope         that living among his family will hasten his cure, but he simply         transfers his fixation with hidden guilt to the domestic front. Why does         his father - a successful author - seem to reject him? What is the secret         struggle being waged between his parents? Why does he feel that he is         the child of a tainted past? <br />In an effort to exorcise his demons, the Allisons and their friends start         telling a series of stories, many of them variations on ancient myths         and legends. Some of these tales serve to reveal the character of the         storyteller, others as a riposte or as a comment on what has gone         before. All of them are meant to advance the psychological and         spiritual action. <br />Many of the tales of D&quot;oblin's long night have an undoubted lurid         power. But there are too many of them, and they ramify too rapidly.         We move through an expressionist phantasmagoria from a wayward         bus in Los Angeles to Pluto and Proserpina, by way of Michelangelo         and Salome and a mock-medieval tale about the Virgin. Edward's         mother, Alice Allison (a significant name, we can be sure), spins         variants of a story about a mother who waits for her son to come back         from the war, now in Montmartre, now in Germany, and elaborates on         the already elaborate legend of her patron saint, Theodora.  In the final stages of the book the distinction between framework and         fantasy starts to break down completely. Yet through the haze it is possible to discern a continuous story         unfolding. The unreality is heightened by an English setting that is in some         respects quite weirdly un-English.<br />At its deepest levels it is         heavily colored by Doblin's religious convictions - an agnostic Jew,         he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1940 - and there can be no         doubting the seriousness with which he devotes himself to major         themes.	2001-02-16

He is probably the most widely known lyric poet of modern times, yet his reputation is only indirectly connected to his poetry. We see him as a man of outrageous morals who chose to write about morbid subjects. He is our archangel of alienation. ''Man was born free, yet everywhere he is in chains,'' Rousseau had written. Baudelaire gave us the spectacle of his chains: the ennui, the revulsive morals, the dance of death of city life with its loneliness, its abyss of degradation. Like the albatross dragging its oarlike wings over the deck in his famous poem, Baudelaire described himself as a fallen angel, no longer able to fly and therefore ludicrous, unadapted. This spectacle of horrible reversal - evil for good, cruelty for kindness - is Baudelaire's trademark. Baudelaire was also a profoundly classical poet. His poems represent a climax of strict French style, of which the other important master was Racine.<br />Like Balzac and Dickens, Baudelaire was a poet of the city. His ''Flowers of Evil'' grew in sunless alleys. The disjointed feelings, the ennui, the cruelty that characterize his poems express the shattered connections of life in the city, where everyone is a stranger, where the past is consumed by the present, especially in mid-19th-century Paris, where familiar neighborhoods were being demolished year by year to make way for monumental buildings and vast boulevards. This disjointed city world is Baudelaire's setting. He dreams of fleeing it in his exotic travel poems, which almost always disclose as their destination an inescapable horror of the heart. There was no exit from Baudelaire's Paris, except for the alchemical change proffered by his rituals of language, his ironically beautiful lyrics...	2001-02-15

US	47736795	R1XNNEO67TCMND	0810115131	350423555	Hourglass (European Classics)	Books	5	13	16	N	N	Train into the Far	If Franz Kafka's Joseph K. had lived in the early 1940's and been         ordered to wear a yellow star in Czechoslovakia, he would have         resembled a character known only as E. S. in this story of         wartime Hungary by Danilo Kis. The trial of         an individual and his family at the hands of a vague and hidden         totalitarian force are described with growing horror and gallows         humor in ''Hourglass,'' a chilling novel in which time is running         out for a marked man riding along the tracks of mortification. <br />        One of the trains he takes eventually must lead to a concentration         camp. But the journal of the final months of his life is told with         such authority in this imaginatively constructed story that the         doomed character appears to be in command of his own destiny.          ''Hourglass,'' translated from the Serbo-Croatian by Ralph         Manheim, is evidently rooted in firsthand family experiences.         The reader is informed that a letter attributed to E. S. in the novel         is based on an actual letter written by Kis's father two years         before his death in Auschwitz. But the universal elements in the         story - the attempt to carry on the everyday routine of life and the         disbelief in an official policy of genocide - offer a parable about         the extermination of the Jews by the Third Reich and its         collaborative governments in occupied Europe. Trains were         essential for the Third Reich to fulfill the quotas for the         Holocaust, and trains play an essential part in the novel. At one         point, the narrator sees himself, with trembling hands, gathering         up his papers in his seat in the first-class carriage and stuffing         them into his briefcase along with bottled beer and         smoked-herring sandwiches. The author then transforms an         ordinary train ride into an act of terror: ''Who was standing         beside him at thatmoment? A young blond conductor, who was         aiming his nickel-plated ticket punch like a revolver at the star on         his chest.'' <br />        The interrogation of the narrator is bizarre. It shows the police         mentality at work in a police state anywhere. The narrator is         questioned about a piano in his home. The line of questioning         goes: Can the piano be used to send signals? Where in the room         is the piano? Can you describe what it looks like? Why was an         open score on the music stand? How do you account for the fact         that the piano was open and that someone had been practicing so         early in the morning? Inevitably, the answers to dumb questions         sound somehow suspicious and lead to more questions. <br />        The nameless E. S. wonders how he can avenge himself against         the armed police. He indulges in a small act of defiance for his         own self-respect: ''Several times he had blown his nose into a         newspaper with the Fuhrer's picture on it. Was he conscious of         the danger he was courting? Definitely. He always folded the         paper as small as possible before throwing it into dense         brambles or the river, thus doing away with the corpus delicti of         his insane and dangerous act.'' There are deliberate breaks in         style as the author shifts back and forth in chapters that are         labeled ''Travel Scenes,'' ''Notes of a Madman,'' ''Criminal         Investigation'' and ''A Witness Interrogated.'' The year 1942 is a         crazy time in the Danube Valley for the first-person narrator. He         is trying to maintain a semblance of sanity while composing a         letter to his sister that forms the spine of the story. If there is a         theme in the novel, it is summed up in the last sentence of that         letter: <br />        ''P. S. It is better to be among the persecuted than among the         persecutors.'' <br />        ''Hourglass''owes a debt to ''The Trial'' by Kafka. In the         narrator's musings, Kafka is cited: ''Everything that is possible         happens; only what happens is possible.'' What distinguishes         Kis's novel is its authorial independence. A conventional         narrative structure is ignored; it is the author's musings and         diversions that magically build suspense. Some paragraphs run         on for pages, others suddenly break into short questions and         answers between the omnipotent state and its helpless victims.         Kis forces the reader to work for him, to pay attention. That he         succeeds is a rare achievement...	2001-02-15

Most of his writings, in fact, deal with the distorting power of Form over the human mind, the seductive allure of immaturity (formless yet imbued with the potential for form), and thus with the questions of identity and the possibility of relationship.

Though         his work for children was widely published in the Soviet Union,         his other efforts were unprintable, thanks to Stalin's iron rule.         These tales have now been collected in &quot;Incidences,&quot; an         admirable work, edited and cleanly translated by Neil Cornwell,         that highlights Kharms's eerie obsessions: a fear of old women         and children, a love of falling bodies and a sensual pleasure in         the scents and sounds of daily life. With remarkable precision         and fluid language, the stories capture everyday tension in a land         where an innocent knock on the door might mean entrapment in a         bureaucratic maze or even death at the hands of the military. By         yoking official policy with personal ire, Kharms reveals how         deeply his contemporaries absorbed and understood their         domination. And by casting his tales within the realm of the         absurd he lifts anxiety into art. The pity is that his life was as         brief as his stories: he was only in his late 30's when he died in         1942, probably in a Leningrad prison...	2001-02-15

He used to be a strict                                          young scholar interested only in \\"ruins and books\\". Now he wants                                          to be free of all obligation and inhibition to fully experience the                                          pleasure and sensuality brought about by his late homosexual                                          awakening. To do so, he sacrifices wife, career, and wealth.  The conflict within Michel is not only that of morality v. sexuality,                                          but mostly that of thought v. emotion, or more simplistically brain                                          v. heart. When he sees his awakened sensuality mirrored in the                                          beauty of nature to which he now becomes aware, Michel                                          discovers that \\"what was the point of thinking?I felt                                          extraordinarily...\\"<br />What constitutes \\"life\\"? This is another important question                                          raised in \\"The Immoralist\\". Michel is reborn when he begins                                          questioning his life: \\"after all what did I mean by `living'?\\" Even                                          here the flaws in Michel's philosophy are apparent. The Christian                                          doctrine of \\"blessed are the poor\\" goes against Michel's doctrine                                          of a leisurely, sensuous life and that \\"poverty makes slaves of                                          men\\", and yet he strives to get rid of his possessions...<br />                                            Who am I? What do I want? These are the kind of questions the                                          reader will ask himself while reading \\"The Immoralist\\". The author                                          is too wise to give definite answers to such great questions.                                          Neither does Gide encourage the reader to decide who is wiser,                                          Marceline, or Michel?

Then comes the voice of Stiller himself: treacherous, evasive and compelling as an Edgar Allan Poe murderer or a Raymond Chandler detective. <br />He is a prisoner in Switzerland (a country &quot;so clean one can hardly breathe for hygiene&quot;) and the Swiss officers who arrest him are convinced he is a certain Anatol Stiller, who disappeared six years ago, leaving behind a wife, a mistress, a moderately successful career and a few minor political scandals. But he insists he is Jim White, an American with a past that includes Mexican peasants, Texas cowboys, the docks and back alleys of Northern California, and three murders, as yet untraced.<br />Murders are committed, as it turns out, but as Stiller is brought face to face with the woman who says she is his wife and with the prosecutor who says Stiller has had an affair with his wife, it becomes clear that the murders in question are emotional, metaphorical and discreetly bourgeois. What binds Stiller and his strong-willed but long-suffering wife, Julika? A vacuum: the fact that they have never felt happy together or complete apart. What sets his dream of being another man in motion? A failure of nerve while fighting the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. And his homeland, economically secure, politically neutral Switzerland is &quot;incapable of suffering in any way over a spiritual compromise,&quot; he says. <br />Mr. Frisch is not really a novelist of ideas; he's a dramatist of ideas. We live out our ideas through our daily lives, after all, and he grasps every nuance of those daily habits and compulsions. It is the tension between these details and the larger ambitions -- so grandly imagined, so absurdly lived out -- that makes the novel work.	2001-02-06

A king flees the ghost of his vizier, whom he has killed, taking refuge in a           labyrinth he builds on the moors of Cornwall. But the ghost, or what seems to be a           ghost, catches up with him, and the king is murdered within his own hiding place.  Many of the familiar elements of his           work are here: arcane knowledge, characters that emerge from some combination           of mythology and scholarship, images of labyrinths, a lightly satirical Homeric tone,           blood and vengeance, the blending of murder and metaphysics, and an interplay of           appearances and apparitions in which reality and illusion are almost           indistinguishable.  Only Borges created literature out of that mixture, though one can guess at some of           his diverse sources of inspiration: Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka, Ralph Waldo           Emerson and Miguel de Cervantes, with a liberal dusting of Omar Khayyam, the           cabala and Islamic theology, and a great deal of esoteric reading. <br />Reading Borges's work chronologically, as this collection is arranged, is to be           reminded of the strangeness of his art. Borges was attracted to fantasy writing, as in his story ''The Aleph,'' but a           very recherche fantasy writing grounded in arcane lore. <br />&quot;There is no intellectual exercise that is not ultimately pointless,'' Borges writes, a           statement produced in full knowledge that he is fashioning an intellectual exercise           about an intellectual exercise. It is a typically enigmatic touch from a writer who           endlessly teases himself and his readers...	2001-02-06

Unrecognized still even after      the war, Schulz is in some circles now considered the finest modern      Polish-language prose stylist. His stories are dreamlike reflections on life      in the modest Jewish quarter of Drohobycz, the town of his birth.

The stories evolve more from the physical landscape than that of the characters, giving an intense life to inanimate objects. A sense of hidden madness, and threads of unspoken desires and fears permeate the book. Schulz writes of his father's creeping insanity, the strange landscape of his small shop, and the forboding accompanying the end of the world with the approach of a comet. While Schulz's imagery and simile get a little repetitive, the atmosphere of living objects and mysterious confluence of life is compelling and hypnotic.<br />His   input continued to illuminate not only the character of his   uncle but also the world in which he wrote and lived.   There is often a lyrical, often somewhat pastoral quality to   much of Bruno Schulz's writing. The external reality so   closely associated with the subjects and settings of his   work are widely regarded as bleak and burnished. The   world he represents in his stories is not necessarily in   keeping with the images often associated with Poland   during his lifetime, he was a writer influenced by the imagination...	2001-01-25

But there is not a single                                         obscene term in Lolita, and aficionados of erotica are likely to find it a                                         dud. Lolita blazes, however, with a perversity of a most original kind.                                         For Mr. Nabokov has distilled from his shocking material                                         hundred-proof intellectual farce. His book is slightly reminiscent of                                         Thomas Mann's Confessions of Felix Krull; but Lolita has a stronger                                         charge of comic genius and is more brilliantly written. Mr. Nabokov has                                         few living equals as a virtuoso in the handling of the English language.                                         But above all Lolita seems to me an assertion of the power of the comic                                         spirit to wrest delight and truth from the most outlandish materials. It is                                         one of the funniest serious novels I have ever read; and the vision of its                                         abominable hero, who never deludes or excuses himself, brings into                                         grotesque relief the cant, the vulgarity, and the hypocritical conventions                                         that pervade the human comedy.	2001-01-25

Unlike &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; (1774), Goethe's         brief epistolary account of the frustrations of life and love         leading to the troubled hero's suicide, Mann's &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;          chronicles four generations in the history of a prosperous         North German bourgeois family. <br />The saga picks up the tale of         the Buddenbrooks in 1835 at the peak of their financial         prosperity and family stability. Old Johann Buddenbrook, son of         the founder of the family firm, has just moved the family and the         business into one of the most handsome houses in town. By the time the novel ends 42 years later, the aging yet still         spirited Tony is almost the only surviving member of the family.         Her parents and grandparents, as well as Thomas and a younger         sister, have died. Christian is confined to an asylum, and the         only male heir is dead. The house has been sold and the firm         liquidated. In the course of hundreds of pages we have         witnessed a succession of marriages, births, divorces and deaths         punctuating the decline of the initially robust family -- a decline         brought about by the weakening of         business acumen and ethics as the family succumbs to the         enticements of wealth, with its inevitable concomitants of sickly         religiosity, artistic inclinations and disease. <br />&quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; constitutes a remarkable achievement for a first         novel.          Incisive characterizations are achieved         through a witty use of German dialects and the adaptation of         leitmotif techniques borrowed from Wagner. And the fast-paced         narrative is tightly controlled by a structure evident in theparallel between the first chapter and the last: both take place on         rainy evenings in the fall, and both feature Tony Buddenbrook in         conversations about religion -- first with her rationally skeptical         grandfather and at the end with her aged teacher, who has         always waged the good fight &quot;against the onslaughts of reason.&quot; &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; encounters a work         that is close in style, vocabulary, idiom and tone to the writer's intent         and can thus appreciate more fully the monumental achievement         of the artist as a young Mann, this is a powerful read!	2001-01-24

Schelling, Hegel (1770-1831)                                         belongs to the period of &quot;German idealism&quot; in the decades following                                         Kant. The most systematic of the post-Kantian idealists, Hegel                                         attempted, throughout his published writings as well as in his lectures, to                                         elaborate a comprehensive and systematic ontology from a &quot;logical&quot;                                         starting point. He is perhaps most well-known for his teleological                                         account of history, an account which was later taken over by Marx and                                         &quot;inverted&quot; into a materialist theory of an historical development                                         culminating in communism. In the twentieth century, the &quot;logical&quot; side of                                         Hegel's thought has been largely forgotten, but his political and social                                         philosophy has continued to find interest and support. However, in the                                         last decades of the century, a degree of more general philosophical                                         interest in Hegel has also been revived. <br />                                        It is clear that Hegel considers the Phenomenology of Spirit not so much                                         as an exercise in philosophy as a type of induction or education of the                                         reader to the standpoint of philosophical thought itself. As such, its                                         structure has been compared to that of an &quot;educational novel&quot;, having an                                         abstractly conceived protagonist -- the bearer of an evolving set of&quot;shapes of consciousness&quot; -- whose progress and set backs the reader                                         follows. At least this is how the work sets out, but in the later sections                                         the earlier &quot;shapes of consciousness&quot; become replaced with what seems                                         more to be shapes of human social existence, and the work comes to                                         look like a type of evolution of interlinked forms of existence and                                         thought characterising the history of western European civilization from                                         the Greeks to the end of the nineteenth century. The fact that it ends in                                         the attainment of &quot;Absolute Knowing&quot; seems to support the traditionalist                                         reading in which a &quot;triumphalist&quot; narrative of the growth of western                                         civilization is combined with the theological interpretation of God's                                         self-manifestation and self-comprehension. Supporters of the                                         non-metaphysical Hegel, however, have argued that what this history                                         tracks is the development of a type of society in which all dogmatic                                         bases of thought have been gradually replaced with demands for                                         conceptually-articulated justifications. Hegel's own pithy account of the                                         nature of philosophy captures a characteristic tension in his philosophical                                         approach and, in particular, in his approach to the nature and limits of                                         human cognition. &quot;Philosophy&quot;, he says there, &quot;is its own time raisedto                                         the level of thought&quot;...	2001-01-24

I do not see Ralph Manheim's new translation of Celine's ''Journey to         the End of the Night'' (New Directions) as an improvement over         John H.P. Marks's fine 1934 version, I see it as more of a refinement of the times, read both of them if you can. It is good to see Celine         being brought back to the public's attention. For all his paranoia         and the questions raised by the anti-Semitic pamphlets he wrote at         the time of World War II, Celine remains one of the great         European novelists of the century, the only logical successor, one         might say, to Dostoyevsky. This is a powerful book not for the weak at heart, it is damaging to all your senses and engulfs you in a wonderful passion for true, great literature.<br />In 1932, with ''Journey to the End of the Night,'' Celine snatched         French fiction from the manicured hands of Gide and Proust and         gave it an elementary gusto, a savage bite it had hardly known         since Rabelais. Four years later, with ''Death on the Installment         Plan,'' he had already snarled and elbowed his way into the         pantheon. <br />''Journey'' is a picaresque novel whose protagonist fights in World         War I, works in Africa, travels to the United States and returns to         Paris to become a doctor. An impoverished doctor in a Paris slum like his antihero         Ferdinand, Celine clearly announced his position when he wrote this fantastic book, he was &quot;against all&quot;. While Cervantes, the other great         picaresque novelist, mourned the death of chivalry, Celine's         subject was the death of civility. As a slum doctor, he had heard         every kind of cry of pain, anger and dispair; you can find them all         in his novels, mixed with his own archetypally French humor and         transmogrified by a style of exalted disgust. Insisting on         spoken rhythms, Celine said that he wanted to have his language         ''throb more than reason&quot;, he called his style of writing the &quot;music in his head&quot;.<br />There's a passage in Nietzsche's ''Beyond Good and Evil'' that         could be the best summary of Celine's qualities. He writes that ''it         might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to         degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for         the sake of which he would have to be honored as a saint in the         lower world in which he had sunk.'' And we can see Celine as the saint of all things forbidden and dark...	2001-01-24

Admirers of Pirandello's plays will be grateful for the new         translation of the author's 1926 novel, &quot;One,         No One, and One Hundred Thousand,&quot; for it illuminates the         background of Pirandello's theatrical works.The novel includes         similar legerdemain; the reader observes the author playing with         time, people and places. It reflects his cross-eyed way of         looking at life and society, later seen in his major plays, &quot;Six         Characters in Search of an Author,&quot; &quot;As You Desire Me&quot; and         &quot;Tonight We Improvise.&quot; <br />The central character in the novel, a small-town squire, looks in         the mirror one day, touches a nostril and feels some pain. His         wife tells him his nose tilts to the right, something he had not         realized before. Catching sight of his reflection in the mirror         again, he concludes that he possesses different personalities. So         begins a search to discover his various selves. After a series of         bizarre incidents, he is deserted by his wife and is declared         insane. The court gives his money to a poorhouse; he becomes         its first guest. In the poorhouse, he becomes the &quot;no one&quot;of the         book's title. <br />        By being no one, the squire becomes everyone. He can be         reborn again and again. &quot;I am I and you are you,&quot; the squire,         speaking as the first-person narrator of the novel, declares. In         the end, he says: &quot;I no longer look at myself in the mirror, and it         never even occurs to me to want to know what has happened to         my face and to my whole appearance. The one I had for the         others must have seemed greatly changed and in a very comical         way, judging by the wonder and the laughter that greeted me.&quot; <br />        Trying to explain a Pirandello plot is like trying to catch a tiger         by the tail or walking with Vulcan on the lava of Mount Etna:         dangerous.

One of the ironies of Italo Svevo's &quot;Confessions of Zeno&quot; is that         the impulsive, undisciplined Zeno is supposed to have composed         such elegant, disciplined prose. The life of Svevo -- actually the         Austrian Ettore Schmitz, a writer of Italian educated in German, a         businessman who hated business and a novelist not known to the         world as such until James Joyce declared him Italy's best -- was         rife with similar contradictions. In &quot;Memoir of Italo Svevo&quot; his         widow, Livia Veneziani Svevo, offers herself as one key to his         surprising success. Svevo began courting Livia, a distant cousin,         when she was 18 years old and just out of convent school and he         was 31 and working in a bank; once she stopped worshiping his         literary genius, she began to see him as a man in pain. In simple,         compelling language, competently translated by Isabel Quigly,         Mrs. Svevo gives readers exactly as much as they need to move         from one Svevo letter or diary entry to the next, and she reveals as         little as possible about herself. The Svevo she depicts was,         indeed, a brilliant, kind and misunderstood man. Her husband's         correspondence with people like Joyce and the French critic         Valery Larbaud is certainly interesting, but nonetheless, throughout         this memoir, the voice of the real Livia, a woman of obvious         character and the wife of -- let's face it -- a severe neurotic, is         sorely missed.	2001-01-23
US	47736795	R35LXZTQL9RWL	0198245971	806887536	Phenomenology of Spirit	Books	5	96	118	N	N	A Great Work of Philosophy	For over 180 years students have complained that Hegel's best-known book of philosophy,         the PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND (alias PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT), is too         difficult to read. A few have tried to summarize Hegel's book, and often their summaries were longer than the         original, and just as difficult to read.<br />The PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND is a study of appearances,         images and illusions throughout the history of human consciousness.         More specifically, Hegel presents the evolution of consciousness.   Hegel traces the evolution of consciousness from savage and         barbaric forms. Hegel's aim was to set forth a philosophical system so comprehensive    that it would encompass the ideas of his predecessors and create a    conceptual framework in terms of which both the past and future could    be philosophically understood. Such an aim would require nothing short    of a full account of reality itself. Thus, Hegel conceived the subject    matter of philosophy to be reality as a whole. This reality, or the total    developmental process of everything that is, he referred to as the    Absolute, or Absolute Spirit. According to Hegel, the task of philosophy    is to chart the development of Absolute Spirit. This involves (1) making    clear the internal rational structure of the Absolute; (2) demonstrating    the manner in which the Absolute manifests itself in nature and human    history; and (3) explicating the teleological nature of the Absolute, that    is, showing the end or purpose toward which the Absolute is directed. The logic that governs this developmental process is    dialectic. The dialectical method involves the notion that movement, or    process, or progress, is the result of the conflict of opposites.    Traditionally, this dimension of Hegel's thought has been analyzed in    terms of the categories of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The goal of the dialectical cosmic process can be most clearly    understood at thelevel of reason. As finite reason progresses in    understanding, the Absolute progresses toward full self-knowledge.    Indeed, the Absolute comes to know itself through the human mind's    increased understanding of reality, or the Absolute. Hegel analyzed this    human progression in understanding in terms of three levels: art,    religion, and philosophy. <br />At the time of Hegel's death, he was the most prominent philosopher in    Germany. His views were widely taught, and his students were highly    regarded. His followers soon divided into right-wing and left-wing    Hegelians. The extensive and diverse impact of Hegel's ideas on subsequent    philosophy is evidence of the remarkable range and the extraordinary    depth of his thought, this book is a masterpiece!	2001-01-23

Can there be any doubt that it is a prophetic book         about our world? Musil is us. The world of &quot;global Austria&quot; in         1913 and &quot;the Parallel Action&quot; -- the plan, in the novel, to claim         1918 for the jubilee celebrating the 70th year of the reign of the         Emperor Francis Joseph before the Germans get it for Kaiser         Wilhelm's 30th, made nonsense of by the intervention of World         War I -- is our world of the United Nations International Decade         for Natural Disaster Reduction and other fatuous schemes. While Musil's contemporaries Proust and Joyce chose interiority         and the private world of memory, Musil is uncannily prescient         about modern life, where sportsmen and criminals are         indifferently idolized, where quantity sits in judgment on quality,         so that an author, as Musil puts it, &quot;must have an awful lot of         like-minded readers before he can pass for an impressive thinker,&quot;         where we sit and stew among &quot;bobsled championships, tennis         cups and luxury hotels along great highways, with golf course         scenery and music on tap in every room.&quot; So &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; is satire; as one character says,         &quot;The man of genius is duty bound to attack.&quot; However, it is not         harsh satire, nor is it sour. There is something loving about it.         Musil's tone is unlike anyone else's. Partly it is the Austrian         melancholy that underlies the book, the melancholy of a defunct         empire, of a closed conditional: what was to happen did not. WHAT if, the novel implies, instead of expressing itself in the         carnage of World War I, human folly had chosen another form?         Partly it is the equable irony that plays over every character,         institution and group in the book that makes reading Musil such an         exquisitely flattering experience. No characters in the book escape mockery -- especially for taking         themselves so seriously.  All of them are skewed and partial, but none are caricatures;         perhaps the book's almost complete lack of physical description         plays a part here -- and yet, in spite of that, you feel you could         pick them out in a lineup. They are Musil's puppets. <br />In his early career he wrote stories, plays and novels that had a         certain popularity. But none of those prepare a reader for the         expanse of &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot;. It took up the last two decades of his life, before         he died in self-imposed exile in Switzerland in 1942, at the age of61.  It is a quite overwhelming novel, quite indeed...	2001-01-23

THIS publication marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of a         writer who, as John Fowles remarks in his useful short         introduction, has been all but forgotten since his suicide in 1942,         but who was during his lifetime ''arguably the most widely read         and translated serious author in the world.'' The quintet of fictions         in ''The Royal Game'' are brilliant, unusual and haunting enough to         ensure that Stefan Zweig's time of oblivion is over for good. <br />The Vienna of Stefan Zweig was a world of bright, brittle         superficialities, in which the bourgeoisie ''gradually elevated the         eternal business of seeing and being seen to the purpose of their         existence.'' To break through the facades of this society, Zweig         developed a remarkable literary and psychological method, which         is brought to something like perfection in the five long stories that         make up this collection. Zweig's method was monomania. His         central characters are all men and women possessed -by an amour         fou or an adolescent hate or an ineradicable guilt or (in the title         story) the game of chess. Narrowed by single-mindedness, they         become knives which Zweig uses remorselessly to cut through to         the dark heart of his superficially glittering world.   The story that most clearly exemplifies Zweig's method here is         ''Fear.'' Its heroine is Irene Wagner, a society lady, ''the wife of the         best-known defence counsel at the law courts.'' She is having an         illicit affair with a young pianist and, from the first sentence,         suffering ''that senseless stab of fear,'' the fear of discovery.  <br />In ''Letter From an Unknown Woman,'' once superbly filmed by         Max Ophuls, Zweig gives us another woman destroyed by love. A         teen-age girl becomes infatuated with a writer who lives in the         apartment across the hall, and she continues to love him throughout         her life without his knowing it. She gives herself to him twice,         once as a young woman and again years later.  ''The Burning Secret'' returns to the theme of extramarital         sexuality. This time the monomaniac is a young boy whose jealous         and half-comprehending hate of the affair he senses between his         mother and a philandering baron prevents the liaison from getting         anywhere. 'Amok'' is another powerful variation on mad passion, and ''The         Royal Game,'' perhaps the most extraordinary of all these tales,         uses the game of chess as a terrifying metaphor for schizophrenia.         A prisoner in solitary confinement begins to play an entirely         mental game of chess with himself, in which he is obliged to         divide his being in two, until this ultrasolipsistic feat brings him         close to madness. In Zweig's hands, ''the royal game'' becomes a symbol of the         tail-swallowing terrors of the life of the mind. <br />These unique tales possess a resonance and a narrative force that         make them compelling. Stefan Zweig was a dark and unorthodox         artist, he was one of great power; it's good to have him back...	2001-01-23

In 1944, Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the author of the novels         ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and ''Death on the Installment         Plan,'' fled his native France. In the preceding decade he had         written pamphlets blaming the impending war on industrialists,         literary figures, politicians and Jews. His anti-Semitism became         increasingly virulent, when the Occupation years ended in 1945 he         went into exile in Denmark, where he was imprisoned for over a         year for collaborating with the Nazis. Given amnesty by France in         1951, Celine returned, and found that his work was largely         ignored. <br />In ''Conversations with Professor Y'' he set out to restore         his reputation as an innovative literary stylist. The book appears         here in English for the first time, alongside the French text, in a         solid translation. Professor Y is a fictional foil         for the author's digs at formal literature, and much of         ''Conversations'' is hilarious. Celine is self-mocking as he tries to         get his name back into circulation. He compares an eager genius to         the new Big Bubbly soap product, is adamant in his revulsion at         the ascendancy of ideas over emotion and is passionate in his         desire to capture the immediacy of conversation on the page. ''The         emotion of spoken language through the written form! Just reflect         on that a bit, dear Professor Y! get your noodle in gear!'' Poor         Professor Y! This dull academician (whose most intelligent         comment is ''Why, holy moly! you're afloat in dialectics!'') is led         on a dizzying tour of Paris, overwhelmed by a crazed author who         claims he's on the brink of a revelation just when the professor         expresses a need to find a bathroom.         ''Conversations''is essential for Celine fans, and a good, if         tame, introduction for the uninitiated.	2001-01-23

In his 1948 debut novel,         ''The Tunnel,'' these themes are already on display, but in a         simplified, almost fabulistic form. Mr. Sabato's narrator         introduces himself, his crime and the object of his passion in the         very first sentence: ''It should be sufficient to say that I am Juan         Pablo Castel, the painter who killed Maria Iribarne.'' He then         launches into an account of his affair with Maria, a married         woman who first draws his attention at an art exhibit. Once their         affair begins, however, her elusiveness provokes his jealousy,         plunging him into a ''personal hell of analyzing and imagining.''         Does she see other men? Does she actually love her frail, blind         husband? Does she love Castel himself? His attempts to answer         these questions grow increasingly contorted and obsessive;         finally, his crazed solipsism displaces romantic passion as the         real subject of the novel. While Castel crouches, knife in hand, in         the shrubbery outside Maria's weekend retreat, he makes his         condition explicit: ''After all there was only one tunnel, dark and         solitary: mine, the tunnel in which I had spent my childhood, my         youth, my entire life.'' When it was first published in Spanish,         ''The Tunnel'' won the applause of Thomas Mann and Albert         Camus and was described as an existentialist classic.  Still, in this fine new translation by Margaret Sayers         Peden, Mr. Sabato's novel retains a chilling, memorable power.	2001-01-23

While the destruction                                         of tradition means the destruction of authenticity, of the originary, in that                                         it also collapses the distance between art and the masses it makes                                         possible the liberation which capitalism both obscures and opposes.                                         Benjamin believes that with the destruction of tradition, libratory                                         potentialities are nonetheless created. The process of the destruction of                                         aura through mass reproduction brings about the &quot;destruction of                                         traditional modes of experience through shock,&quot; in response new forms                                         of experience are created which attempt to cope with that shock. <br />                                        Allegoresis and collection are the twin foci around which the elliptical                                         writings of Walter Benjamin orbit. The former, as a mode of criticism,                                         transforms the latter practice into a version of materialist historicism.                                         Instead of constructing further barriers between his own practice and the                                         practices of the historical moment he would transcend, Benjamin                                         embraces the underside of his own theories in &quot;The Work of Art in the                                         Age of Mechanical Reproduction.&quot; There he proclaims the disintegration                                         of the aura and champions the revolutionary potential which is thus                                         released. It will be of use therefore, to look at some of his other                                         references to the aura. It's as though Benjamin takes more seriously than                                         Marx the notion that capitalism contains its own subversion--the path to                                         subversion is not to resist and revolt, but to accede and accelerate...	2000-10-06

Help!&quot; I shouted,                   just to see if it would have any effect on them. None                   whatsoever. Those people were pushing life and night and                   day in front of them. Life hides everything from people.                   Their own noise prevents them from hearing anything else.                   They couldn't care less. The bigger and taller the city, the                   less they care. Take it from me. I've tried. It's a waste of                   time. --from Journey to the End of the Night<br />                  Journey is very much what it sounds like -- a loosely                   autobiographical wandering that starts with the author                   enlisting almost by accident to fight in WWI. He doesn't                   waste time describing the war as being a giant, immoral                   waste of everyone's time and life, really, with the soldier's                   main mission of the day being little more than looking for a                   place to eat without getting his head shot off. And to treat it                   as anything more than that, Celine suggests, is something of                   a waste of time: What's more important to any discussion of                   war than its inherent stupidity? The same, it seems, goes for                   the rest of the story -- the basic undercurrent of the story is                   the world's core idiocity and how you deal with it (if you                   choose to).

Horkheimer defines true reason as rationality. He details the difference between objective and subjective reason and states that we have moved from objective to subjective. Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. Subjective reason takes into account the situation and social norms. Actions that produce the best situation for the individual are &quot;reasonable&quot; according to subjective reason. The movement from one type of reason to the other occurred when thought could no longer accommodate these objective truths or when it judged them to be delusions. Under subjective reason, concepts lose their meaning. All concepts must be strictly functional to be reasonable. Because subjective reason rules, the ideals of a society, for example democratic ideals, become dependent on the &quot;interests&quot; of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. <br />Horkheimer is writing in 1946 and is influenced by Nazi power in Germany. He is outlining how the Nazis were able to make their agenda appear &quot;reasonable&quot;. He is also issuing a warning against this happening again. Horkheimer believes that the ills of modern society are caused by the misuse and misunderstanding of reason. If people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to identify and solve their problems.	2000-10-05

He virtually created the detective story and perfected the psychological thriller. He also produced some of the most influential literary criticism of his time -- important theoretical statements on poetry and the short story -- and has had a worldwide influence on literature.<br />Throughout Edgar Allen Poe's life, many factors have contributed and influenced his writing style. He lived a difficult life, because he was raised in a dysfunctional household. But the final product of Edgar Allen Poe's mind is printed in his short stories and poems. Edgar Allen Poe's stories all have similar motifs and composition that would suggest suppressed emotions from life experiences are being discharged through his writings. <br />In a great short story, &quot;The Tell Tale Heart&quot; the narrator doesn't hate the man that he's going to kill, he hates the fake eye. The eye represents evil, and Poe converts everything to black and white. If a part of the kind man is evil, then the whole man is evil, hence, he kills him. And Poe doesn't see the act of killing bad, but a cleansing action, ridding the world of one more evil. <br />In &quot;The Descent into the Maelstrom&quot; the captain was the old man / father figure. Guiding the people in the boat closet to the edge of existence, into the maelstrom. And Poe makes it the captains fault that they are caught in the outer ring of the maelstrom and are coming closer to the center. But he shows his optimistic side as the vessel escapes the whirlpool, and breaks free. <br />Likewise in the &quot;Black Cat&quot;, the husband in the story was particularly cruel and unjust to the cats. The cats were probably representing Poe when he was defenseless and young. And the temper that his step-father would act out on Poe, was the same temper that the &quot;cat-killer&quot; would kill the cat and his wife.<br />The most prominent feature of Edgar Allen Poe's writing is his obsession with death. Poe's writing does more than entertain the reader. It can be an insight into the dark and somber world of Edgar Allen Poe. One does not understand the meaning of Poe if one reads at the superficial level. One has to read into Poe, and understand the hardships of his life and how he maintained them that way. He knew that death was an inevitable part of life, it is the price of life, but, he tried to fight it as if it was an unnatural part of life. He was an extremely intriguing man from all view points, and he was and is, the dark side of all of us...	2000-10-05
US	47736795	R2QJVBTB67UNOM	0802132359	815487430	Mercier and Camier	Books	5	33	35	N	N	Waiting for Poe	Written in 1946, &quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; was Samuel Beckett's first postwar novel and his first in French. &quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; captures the time of depression and indecision in Beckett's life. It continues the line of vagabond heroes which begins with Belacqua in &quot;More Pricks Than Kicks&quot; and continues with &quot;Murphy&quot; and &quot;Watt.&quot; They are the first of his vaudevillian couples, and this novel is in many ways the precursor of &quot;Waiting for Godot.&quot; If there is a chronological line of development in his writing, &quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; surely marks the first tentative approach toward what Beckett calls the &quot;mature&quot; fiction of &quot;Molloy,&quot; &quot;Malone Dies&quot; and &quot;The Unnamable.&quot; In the trilogy, Beckett relentlessly reduces his characters from pitiful creatures with few possessions--a hat, a pot, a stub of pencil--to voices, who have only the inner torments of their past life to sustain their present existence, doomed to repeat themselves until finally, even the voice, their last vestige of humanity, is stilled. There is no discernible setting, no tie with any real existence, and seemingly, no plot. <br />In &quot;Mercier and Camier,&quot; the journey shapes the plot as the two men parade on an endless quest. Despite its somberness, it is in some ways a warm and funny book, occasionally tinged with stinging sarcasm. There are secondary characters, skillfully and swiftly delineated, so bizarre that even the two oddities of the title are struck by their madness. Mercier and Camier are otherworldly figures themselves, but they need the trappings of the real world in order to give their story coherence, and this is no doubt part of the reason why Beckett chose to abandon them and go on to the Malones and Malloys of his later fiction. <br />Just about this time, Beckett discovered that writing was for him the most intensely personal experience possible, depending not on verbal virtuosity or on the careful construction of the traditional novel. For him, creation satisfied only when he could plumb the depths of his unconscious, find an incident from his own life, and then work to conceal biography within the framework of his creative consciousness, changing dimensions of time and space according to the whim of his fictional voices. He reduces life to a series of tales, told first by one, then another (perhaps the same) voice, but all the voices are his. <br />Beckett perfected this method of writing novels when he discovered what he has called the most important revelation of his literary career--the first person monologue. He found he could create a multi-dimensional universe through the use of a voice telling a story. At the same time, this relentless voice could reveal character in its most desperate loneliness, stripping it as never before in contemporary fiction. <br />Written just before &quot;Molloy,&quot; &quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; stands on the threshold of Beckett's mature fiction. There are large chunks of dialogue which he later transferred directly into Godot, but here speech is encumbered by a plot with progression and movement, albeit circuitous and often contradictory. There is a narrator, as in &quot;Murphy&quot; and &quot;Watt,&quot; who occasionally intrudes to inject an acerbic comment and who thinks nothing of slowing down, speeding up, or otherwise circumventing the progress of the &quot;pseudo-couple&quot; (as they are called in &quot;The Unnamable&quot;). <br />&quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; is about voluntary exile, much like Beckett's own. While it can be read as the odyssey of Beckett and the other young Irishmen who went to Paris in the 1930's hoping to gain the same success as their countryman of an older generation, James Joyce, it can also be read as two aspects of the personality of Beckett himself. Before his departure, he had been easily recognizable in Dublin by his shapeless, dirty raincoat, several sizes toolarge. He was plagued by recurring idiosyncratic cysts. When he wrecked his own car, he had continuous problems with his bicycle. In a drunken moment, he lost his favorite hat, which he mourned long afterwards. <br />It is the raincoat, however, which best symbolizes the final division of his first 30 years from the rest of his life, as well as this novel's place in his canon: when he left Dublin, Beckett threw his raincoat away, just as Mercier and Camier, after throwing theirs away, walk off into their own uncertain future, looking back now and again at the heap on the ground--unwilling to go on with it, but hesitant to abandon it...	2000-10-05

Among the most influential philosophers of modern times,                   Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) declared in this classic                   study that Greek tragedy achieved greatness through a fusion                   of elements of Apollonian restraint and control with                   Dionysian components of passion and the irrational. In                   Nietzsche's eyes, however, Greek tragedy had been                   destroyed by the rationalism and optimism of thinkers like                   Socrates. Nevertheless, he found in these ancient works the                   life-affirming concept that existence is still beautiful,                   however grim and depressing it may sometimes be...	2000-10-04

THE STRANGER is one of those timeless classics sure                       to disturb new readers well into the next millenium.                       Albert Camus is dealing with truth here, and truth, like                       life, is not for everyone. And neither is this book. I                       wouldn't have it any other way. Camus' pitifully honest                       anti-hero Meursault finds himself on the wrong end of                       French justice following a carefully plotted train of                       carelessly indifferent but seemingly innocent decisions                       culminating in one senseless murder that is the real                       mystery of the novel. Why did he do it? Who is Monsieur                       Meursault, really? Naturally, the reason supplied by the                       author is strongly provocative and certainly                       unsatisfactory for most if not all. The writing is terse,                       economic, exact. A wonder, really. Readers should note                       what is said just as well as what is. This book did what                       few books can. I was left in a state of aesthetic arrest,                       neither drawn to nor repulsed by story or character, a                       sort of neutral zone where all fear and loathing have been                       replaced by pure wonder--much like Meursault himself.                       THE STRANGER only confirms for me what I have                       always suspected: in the hands of a master, writing is the                       highest form of art. What Camus achieves in a few pages                       most modern authors would spend chapters doing.	2000-10-04

Through his unforgettable     gallery of characters, Dostoyevsky provides a provocative look at     the human motivations of obsession and possession with     unflinching philosophical and moral insight. A masterpiece of     dramatic literature by one of the greatest novelist of all time.     Crime and Punishment is the story of a murder committed on     principle, of a killer who wishes by his action to set himself     outside and above society. A novel of great physical and     psychological tension, pervaded by Dostoevsky's sinister     evocation of St Petersburg, it also has moments of wild humour.     Dostoevsky's own harrowing experiences mark the novel. He had     himself undergone interrogation and trial, and was condemned to     death, a sentence commuted at the last moment to penal     servitude. In prison he was particularly impressed by one     hardened murderer who seemed to have attained a spiritual     equilibrium beyond good and evil: yet witnessing the misery of     other convicts also engendered in Dostoevsky a belief in the     Christian idea of salvation through suffering.

The                   first man to succumb sits in his car, waiting for the light to                   change. He is taken to an eye doctor, who does not know                   what to make of the phenomenon -- and soon goes blind                   himself. The blindness spreads, sparing no one. Authorities                   confine the blind to a vacant mental hospital secured by                   armed guards under instructions to shoot anyone trying to                   escape. Inside, the criminal element among the blind holds                   the rest captive: food rations are stolen, women are raped.                   The compound is set ablaze, and the blind escape into what                   is now a deserted city, strewn with litter and unburied                   corpses. The only eyewitness to this nightmare is the                   doctor's wife, who faked blindness in order to join her                   husband in the camp. She guides seven strangers through the                   barren streets. The bonds within this oddly anonymous                   group -- the doctor, the first blind man and his wife, the old                   man with the black eye patch, the girl with dark glasses, the                   boy with no mother, and the dog of tears -- are as uncanny                   as the surrounding chaos is harrowing. Told with                   compassion, humor, and lyricism, Blindness is a stunning                   exploration of loss and disorientation in the modern world,                   of man's will to survive against all odds.	2000-10-04

These elements are amply present in                   themes exploring man's battle against nature (and fellow                   man), the self-destructiveness of hatred, the bounds of                   loyalty, commitment to family and the need to revere God.

In that wild, beautiful romance, Melville seems to                   have spoken the very secret of the sea, and to have drawn                   into his tale all the magic, all the sadness, all the wild joy                   of many waters.

He is one                   of the most influential European novelists of the last                   hundred years, yet he is not well known in the United States.                   Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, the most important                   Norwegian author since Ibsen, he is often ignored in his                   own country. He is Knut Hamsun -- novelist of genius... <br />                  Hamsun, in &quot;Mysteries, Pan, and Hunger&quot;, wrote three of                   the greatest novels of the late nineteenth century, novels                   which created a new literary style and which delineated a                   new literary hero: the alienated loner. His work was widely                   admired in the first half of the twentieth century, with                   writers as diverse as Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, and                   Henry Miller citing Hamsun's work as being of special                   importance and influence. Isaac Bashevis Singer, in his                   essay &quot;Knut Hamsun, Artist of Skepticism&quot; goes so far as to                   claim that &quot;the whole modern school of fiction in the                   twentieth century stems from Hamsun.&quot; Henry Miller said of                   &quot;Mysteries&quot; that it &quot;is closer to me than any other book I've                   read.&quot; The second of Hamsun's great early novels, and my                   personal second favorite...!	2000-10-04

This story, one of Gogol's most famous is skillfully narrated                   to reflect the author's frustration with civil service and the                   plight of the poor, and will evoke an emotional response                   among listeners. Akakii Akakievich is a lowly government                   clerk. When winter begins he notices that his old overcoat                   is beyod repairing. He manages to save money for a new,                   luxurious coat. His colleagues at the office arrange a party                   for his acquisition. But his happiness proves to be                   short-lived. On the way home he is attaced by thieves and                   robbed of his coat. To recover his lost possession,                   Akakievich asks help from an Important Person, a director                   of a department with the rank of general. He treats                   Akakievich harshly and Akakievich dies of fright within                   three days. One night when the Important Person is rerutning                   home, he is attacked by a ghost, late Akakii Akakievich,                   who steals his overcoat. The stealing of outer garments                   continue, even though now the ghost is a big man with a                   moustache and enormous fists. A simpler, if perhaps more                   prosaic, way of restating the general thrust of the storyline                   would be to say that 'The Overcoat' is like a good poem. It                   can be endlessly annotated, interpreted, dissected, but still                   emerges whole and fresh, like a new morning...	2000-10-04

I am a spiteful man.&quot;<br />                  Notes from Underground is one of the most influential                   pieces of fiction in Western European history. It contains an                   all-out assault on Enlightenment rationalism and the idea of                   progress which foreshadows many such assaults in the                   mid-to-late twentieth century. An outstanding example of                   Dostoyevsky's psychological skills, depicting a character                   motivated by many contradictory impulses are found in the                   novel. One of the most salient characteristics of the                   Underground Man is his profound self-contempt combined                   with an exquisitely sensitive ego--a combination that is                   much discussed these days. Portraying him as one of the                   first anti-heroes in fiction, a protagonist utterly lacking                   every trait of the Romantic hero and living out a futile life                   on the margins of society. Such figures were to dominate                   much serious fiction in the mid-twentieth century, notably                   Albert Camus' Meursault in The Stranger. Dostoyevsky thus                   makes clear that the underground man's irrationalist solution                   is no better than the rationalists' systems.	2000-10-04

James Joyce's Ulysses has been hailed as a masterpiece                   since its publication in 1922. This tale of the adventures of                   advertising salesman Leopold Bloom on June 16, 1904, in                   Dublin is a remarkable conflation of mythology, symbolism,                   philosophy, social realism, and humanity. Bloom's                   relationships with wife Molly and surrogate son Stephan                   Dedalus reflect the simple decency of the common man.                   There is no doubt that reading Ulysses places great                   demands on the intellect of the reader. Joyce's intentions in                   writing Ulysses, to present a totally realistic view of one                   day in the life of ordinary Dublin citizens, yet at the same                   time to weave into this a grand parallel with Homer's                   Odyssey and on a smaller scale to deal with issues as                   complicated as those of Irish politics and religion, mean                   that before they come upon the novel, it is necessary for the                   reader to have a wide base of knowledge. The act of                   interpretation becomes not a burden but an essential part of                   the act of reading Ulysses for without it the reader might not                   gain the sense that they are one of the people that the novel                   is addressed to, rather than just an observer of a finite                   experience...	2000-10-04

Best known for the mainstream Taras Bulba, The Inspector                   General, and Dead Souls, the Ukrainian Gogol wrote some                   excellent early absurdist stories including &quot;The Nose,&quot; &quot;The                   Carriage&quot;, and the seminal &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. Another                   well-known story, &quot;The Overcoat&quot;, considered one of                   Gogol's best works, also has several distinctively absurdist                   characteristics, including: the antinomy of outward                   appearance and inner reality, the related issue of                   questioning socially established values, and a fantastic                   ending. &quot;The Nose&quot; by Nikolai Gogol is more a reflection                   of the technique of story telling than any attempt to create a                   narrative. Indeed, Gogol purposely mangles form and                   content, breaking all conventions of traditional writing. The                   plot and more importantly, the way he presents it is a                   nonsensical jumble full of gaps, contradictions,                   interruptions and extraneous information. The piece is only                   unified through its attempt to betray the reader's                   assumptions of how a story should be told. Gogol opens                   strongly, establishing the normal foundation for a coherent                   plot to develop. &quot;On 25 March a most extraordinary                   occurrence took place in St. Petersburg.&quot; (Gogol) A man                   named Kovalyov wakes up that morning to discover his                   nose is missing, in its place nothing but smooth skin. &quot;The                   Nose&quot; spends many pages following Kovalyov through                   futile attempts to recover his nose. Like the narrator,                   Kovalyov is often distracted from his mission by random                   thoughts andevents.	2000-10-04

His father -- an  ambitious, materialistic tyrant --overshadowed much of Kafka's  work as well as his existence. Kafka was a charming, intelligent,  and humorous individual, but he found his routine office job and  the exhausting double life into which it forced him (for his  nights were frequently consumed in writing) to be excruciating  torture, and his deeper personal relationships were neurotically  disturbed.<br /> First published in 1915, this is the story of  Gregor Samsa, a young traveling salesman who lives with and  financially supports his parents and younger sister. One morning  he wakes up to discover that during the night he has been  transformed into a &quot;monstrous vermin&quot; or insect. At  first he is preoccupied with practical, everyday concerns: How to  get out of bed and walk with his numerous legs? Can he still make  it to the office on time?<br /> Soon his abilities, tastes, and  interests begin to change.  No one can understand his  insect-speech. He likes to scurry under the furniture and eat  rotten scraps of food.  Gregor's family, horrified that Gregor  has become an enormous insect, keep him in his bedroom and refuse  to interact with him. This is a great short story representing  modern man and the modern life...  END	2000-10-04

In this epic, semi-autobiographical novel of poverty and                   despair, Hamsun's narrator is a poor writer who depends                   upon the sale of articles and stories to the press for his                   living. He is usually destitute and often hungry, and during                   the long intervals when he is underfed, his mood swings                   wildly between euphoria and bleak, self-destructive                   hopelessness. Written with brutal candor and strong feeling,                   the story is deliberately anti-coherent; Hamsun said of his                   fiction, &quot;I dream of a literature with characters in which                   their very lack of consistency is their basic characteristic.&quot;                   HUNGER created a sensation when it was published, and                   remains one of the great triumphs of modern naturalism.	2000-10-04

Written in 1914, The Trial is one of the most important                   novels of the twentieth century: the terrifying tale of Josef                   K., a respectable bank officer who is suddenly and                   inexplicably arrested and must defend himself against a                   charge about which he can get no information. Whether read                   as an existential tale, a parable, or a prophecy of the                   excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the madness of                   totalitarianism, Kafka's nightmare has resonated with                   chilling truth for generations of readers. This new edition is                   based upon the work of an international team of experts                   who have restored the text, the sequence of chapters, and                   their division to create a version that is as close as possible                   to the way the author left it.	2000-10-04
