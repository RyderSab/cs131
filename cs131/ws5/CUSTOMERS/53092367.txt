I'm perplexed at the reviews on these pages that scoff at the improbability or implausibility of \\"Bel Canto's\\" main premise.  Ann Patchett's story gets its inspiration from the real-life taking of the Japanese Embassy by MRTA terrorists in 1996 - 1997.  Here's a wire story at the beginning of that event in December 1996:<br /><br />\\"The 23 terrorists from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) who are holding about 340 men captive in the Japanese ambassador's residence released 38 hostages unexpectedly on Friday night. Water, chicken, salad and rolls were also delivered into the house on Friday. Portable toliets may be the next items to be sent in. Many are saying that there may not be a quick end to the apparent impasse.\\"<br /><br />And here's how the tale ended four+ months later (the same duration endured by Patchett's captives):<br /><br />\\"Troops have stormed the Japanese embassy in Peru and freed all but one of 72 hostages held inside, ending a four-month siege of the building by anti-government rebels.  All 14 Tupac Amaru rebels were killed, including their leader, Nestor Cerpa Cartolini.  One hostage - supreme court judge Carlos Giusti Acuna - died, as well as two Peruvian soldiers.\\"<br /><br />I'm not giving anything away here - Patchett presages the ending of the tale within the first couple of pages - but simply trying to point out that Patchett's premise is, in fact, far from improbable.  She's simply envisioned and created a fictitious series of characters and events ensconced on the 'other side' of a real happening.  In particular, she examines the tight bonds created between captor and hostage when forced into closing living quarters for over four months.  In my book, the author gets very high marks for this blending of real-life with compelling fiction.	2005-10-05

Who knows if Foer himself came up with this hook or whether it got foisted on him by editors and PR types, but it really doesn't do the book or its well-meaning author justice.  For example, in the chapter \\"How Soccer Explains the Jewish Question,\\" we get some good reporting on the anti-Semitic overtones of some teams and well as the Jewish roots of others.  But to say, therefore, that soccer 'explains' the 'Jewish Question'?  Ummm...No.<br /><br />But don't let that dissuade you from picking up a copy of Foer's work.  Again, there's terrific reporting here - standouts include chapters on \\"The Black Carpathians\\" (my personal favorite) which focuses on a Nigerian import to a top Ukranian club team, and \\"The New Oligarchs,\\" an excellent overview on soccer's shift from paternalistic industrialists like the Agnellis (owners of Juventus) to new-styled \\"oligarchs\\" like Silvio Berlusconi (owner of AC Milan).  By using a term like 'oligarch,' I was hoping for  some red meat on Chelsea's Roman Abramovich.  The oligarch's oligarch, he gets only passing mention in \\"The Sentimental Hooligan\\" chapter.  Still, Foer's discection of the machinations and interactions of Italian media, business interests and the game are fascinating.<br /><br />And, for those of you wondering: yes, Franklin Foer is the brother of novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, author of \\"Everything Is Illuminated.\\"	2005-09-10

The basic idea is a good one - Nazi Germany \\"won\\" the war and is now 20 some years into its post-war existence.  Where Harris excels is in combining a pretty fair detective thriller (about a murder and a cover-up) with some well thought out reasoning about the state of a Hitler-dominated world circa early 1960s.  For those of you who shy away from anything packaged as a mass market paperback, Harris' work surely surpasses the average work of this genre and is definitely worthy of your consideration.<br /><br />\\"Fatherland\\" was made into a pretty good TV movie (1995) - it garnered an Emmy nomination for lead Rutger Hauer and an Emmy win for Miranda Richardson as Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV.	2005-09-08

I liken it to one of my favorite books, \\"Cuban Diaries\\" by Isadora Tattlin in that its triumph is in describing day-to-day activities which are, at first, seemingly prosaic but fascinating upon inspection.  Author Dumas actually makes light of her approach noting that some of her first book proposals were rejected because of something along the lines of \\"your work doesn't depict the struggle of Iranian women to express their political views.\\"  Ummm, that's definitely not the intent here.  \\"Funny in Farsi\\" is instead the interesting tale of one family's struggle to fit into US life while maintaining a sense of their national identity.<br /><br />A recommendation:  Make sure you get the paperback edition, which includes a very neat epilogue discussing the success of the hardback and Dumas' parents' reaction to it, which is alone worth the price of the book.  There's a hilarious account of Dumas' Dad's monitoring of the book's sales rank on \\"Amahzone\\" (sample quote:  \\"Yesterday at ten in the morning, it was 46,789.  Today at ten, it's 42,857.  It's going crazy!\\")  Daughter Firoozeh's take is that her father \\"now has a small notebook filled with what is possibly the world's most useless information.\\"<br /><br />Well, Kazem: your daughter is at 16,850 this morning.  How about that?  It was fascinating reading about you.  Your integrity and character (and that of your wife's) shine through every page of your daughter's book.

Never once do you say to yourself \\"okay, this part is boring, let's move on.\\"  Chapter after chapter fascinates, whether its about Armstrong, his mother and latest husband (archly referred to as Mr. Four/Five by the clever Mr. Coyle), \\"the nicest guy Tyler Hamilton,\\" \\"the notorious Dr. Michele Ferrari,\\" Floyd Landis, Sheryl Crow, etc., etc...it's all here in can't-put-it-down, exquisitely observed, juicy detail.<br /><br />What comes out is a balanced picture of Armstrong, who lords over the proceedings as a dominating force.  By all accounts, this is a very, very complicated man, someone with this \\"huge life\\" (aptly put by close observers) who not only doesn't get steamrolled by this swirling mass around him but, rather, directs it, pushes it and elevates it.  The essence of the Armstrong persona is captured perfectly by an early training partner who - once on the outs like so many others - says (talking of the relationship between Armstrong and mother) \\"It's the anger they have, that's the bad thing and the good thing, because it's what created the whole package.\\"  That's the theme Coyle adroitly mines over and over: you can't be Lance Armstrong and have a soft-edge, can't we all get along personality.  You're going to break some crockery.  Or, in Armstrong's case, a lot of crockery.<br /><br />If you've got even a casual interest in what made and drives Lance Armstrong, Daniel Coyle's book is something you cannot skip.	2005-08-22

I recall that when Telfair arrived on the cover of Sports Illustrated as a generously-listed 6-foot guard from Lincoln High in Coney Island, he (as opposed to media phenom LeBron James the year before) seemed to explode into national prominence out of nowhere.  O'Connor's book shows you that the author and other savvy talent spotters had tabbed Telfair as a potential NBA lottery pick 12 months or more in advance (indeed, O'Connor shows that people were annointing \\"Bassy\\" as NBA-grade as far back as fourth grade).<br /><br />You've really got to hand it to O'Connor for having the prescience as a journalist to start following the kid, then watch his subject lead his team to third straight NYC title, land on the SI cover, sign a mega-deal with Adidas and become the first small high-school guard to be tabbed in the draft a lottery pick (Portland Trailblazers at #13).<br /><br />All in all, a great read about the hidden (and rather seamy) side of the many, many hands in the circle trying to position and push an 18-year-old kid into the NBA.  Through it all, Telfair comes out looking and sounding like a pretty good kid.  From the tone of the book, it sounds like O'Connor would attest to that conclusion.  It's amazing that with a veritable maelstrom around him all year, Telfair basically blocked out most of it and played some really fine ball in all-star settings, thereby sealing the lottery deal.<br /><br />One can't help read this book and wonder how two recent events are going to forever change the the type of scenes O'Connor describes in 'The Jump'\\": David Stern's decision to increase the minimum draft age to 19; and Adidas' decision to buy Reebok (O'Connor demonstrates that the escalating \\"sneaker wars\\" are in large part driven by the fierce three-headed competition between Reebok, Adidas and Nike.).	2005-08-15

A scant 20 years later, Ojito - then only 36 years old - was at the pinnacle of her profession, having won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting while at the New York Times.  In \\"Finding Ma&ntilde;ana\\" she expertly weaves together two gripping sagas: how her own family came to be at the docks that Spring of 1980; and how Mariel as a whole came to be.  Far from simply a personal narrative, \\"Ma&ntilde;ana\\" qualifies as investigative reporting of the highest order.  Ms. Ojito tells a fascinating tale of behind the scenes intrigue as \\"the Cuban government sets in motion a plan far more sophisitated and sinister than a simple military assault.\\"  In fact, the events leading up to Mariel sound - for all intents and purposes - like Civil War had been unleashed inside of Cuba.<br /><br />\\"Ma&ntilde;ana\\" also serves as a good complement to other good reads about Cuba.  For example, in Ann Louise Bardach's controversial \\"Cuban Confidential,\\" we learn about the realiance Castro placed on confidante Celia Sanchez.  So, it's enlightening to read Ojito's take on Mariel occurring shortly after Sanchez's death in January 1980:  \\"Those closest to him knew that Castro had lost not only a friend and ally, but also his personal compass.\\"<br /><br />And, if you've read Reinaldo Arenas' \\"Before Night Falls,\\" you have a feeling of glancing through the looking glass.  Ojito makes reference to Castro's seeding the boatlift with those he deemed as his undesirables.  In Julian Schnabel's excellent take of the book on film, a bewildered Arenas (played indelibly by Javier Bardem) is taken abruptly and unexpectedly to Mariel, Castro and his administration having decided to export his homosexuality and political activism.<br /><br />Most of all, I recommend Ojito's book as a complement to my personal favorite, \\"Cuba Diaries : An American Housewife in Havana by Isadora Tattlin.\\"  Some people have sloughed off that work as prosaic, but I think it misses the point: this book captures the challenge carrying out day-to-day tasks in Cuba under Fidel.<br /><br />Here's one example of Ojito's reporting and how informative and compelling it can be (this from an interview she had with one of Mariel's stateside protagonists, Napoleon Vilaboa):<br /><br />\\"Give me a hug, chico, he said, and the two embraced.  Vilaboa winced.  Castro was smoking a cigar, and the aroma of the tobacco, which Vilaboa enjoyed, was mixed with the odor of rancid sweat, cognac and old coffee.  Castro kept his olive green cap on, and Vilaboa noticed that it was very sweaty and stained.  Vilaboa wondered how long he had been wearing the same uniform.  How long since he had taken a nap, or a bath?\\"<br /><br />If you're like me, you find that type of revelation fascinating.

But Gary Pomerantz' outstanding effort is so much more...more than Wilt, more than 1962.  Pomerantz picks up Wilt towards the end of his life...the 20,000 women fallout, hip failing him, excrutiating tooth pain, and eventually a sad, solitary death despite support from a small circle of friends such as loyal long-time confidant Lynda Huey.<br /><br />Pomerantz has also penned great profiles of the game's supporting players and the others that called it, arranged it, coached it, watched it.  In particular, the trio of Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb, announcer Dave Zinkoff and PR man Harvey Pollack stand out.  Zinkoff's inimitable calls of games lasted decades beyond 1962.  NBA fans will remember with clarity his signature call of a Julius Erving basket while working courtside as the 76ers long-time voice at the Spectrum.  And Harvey Pollack transformed from PR flack to NBA statistician extraordinaire.<br /><br />But the heart of the book are the long-buried details of Wilt's mind-boggling effort in Hershey, Pennsylvania on this cold March 1962 night.  Pomerantz' perfect imagery - as he locates old tapes and accounts of the game - was that it was akin to bringing up pieces of gold from a sunken Spanish galleon.  The shot-by-shot accounting of the fourth quarter is nothing short of breathtaking.  What's interesting is how it really ceased to be a basketball game at all - the Warriors not playing defense and the Knicks (attempting to stall) for all intents and purposes not playing offense.  [Indeed, one the game's participants notes that if you walked into the arena in the fourth quarter, you'd be perplexed by the site of the losing team attempting to run out the clock.]<br /><br />And, as someone born in 1961, I'm struck with having to attempt (like many readers, I'm sure) the Wilt of my youth - a muscular, lumbering rebounder/passer who led the lead in *assists* - with this coltish, indefatigable beast of a player who was a scoring savant.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic piece of reporting - in the realms of both sports and its place in society - by Gary Pomerantz.this coltish, indefatigable beast of a player who was a scoring savant.  <br /> <br />All in all, a fantastic piece of reporting - in the realms of both sports and its place in society - by Gary Pomerantz.	2005-07-22

At the end of the tale, you heart goes out to his widow Dominique and her three now-fatherless children.<br /><br />I was fascinated throughout this enjoyable read at the level at which Mr. Chemelski, the Connecticut born and bred author, has steeped himself in the culture of French gastronomy.  We often overuse the term \\"tour de force\\" when talking about about an impressive display of talent, but it really fits here.  Chelemski seems like he was born in the kitchen of a three-star Paris eatery.  His comprehensive knowledge of all aspects of the French dining scene and its place in the world will take your breath away.

In doing so, he really proves that he's no mere talking head.  To the contrary, there are some real heady, well-thought out policy ideas in 'Wave.'  For example, Ramos concludes his book by laying out 10 recommendations for politicians to \\"understand the Hispanic experience and improve the lives of Latinos.\\"  One of those points is \\"Make Latin America a Prominent Part of US Foreign Policy.\\"  At this point in the book, Ramos has detailed quite effectively the short shrift that Latin American politics are given by our leaders, the price to be paid (and will be paid) for that neglect, and how this oversight infuriates Latinos in this country.<br /><br />Ramos also has his finger right on the pulse of the hidden secret of immigrant labor:  while many politicians publicly denounce its impact, the truth is that immigrant labor pays taxes and FICA and thereby is a critical cog in shoring up our Baby Boomers' expectations of Social Security benefits.  As one expert is quoted as saying, because of the size of the Baby Boomer generation compared to our 'indigenous' workforce, the US economy is more dependent on immigrant labor now than at any point in the last 100 years.<br /><br />Jorge Ramos' insightful work is definitely worth your time.	2005-07-07

During that time, he re-connected with his high school's basketball program.  He was agog at how things had changed in the 10+ years since he graduated.  In comparison to the \\"Hoosiers\\" he left behind, Wertheim finds that Streetball-fueled athleticism is permeating every aspect of basketball, in every Indiana town.<br /><br />Wertheim's book juxtaposes this new reality vs. the iconic image of the lone Indiana youth practicing his free throws in a driveway in small town.  It's a theme he develops well in this book, but perhaps not as extensively as the eye-rolling sub-title of the book (\\"How Hoosiers Went Hip-Hop\\") implies.  I imagine Wertheim blanched a bit when he saw that.  Rather then deep-diving into hip-hop culture, \\"Transition Game\\" takes the reader on a 360-degree view of Indiana basketball - small high schools, big high schools, IU, Purdue's women's team, the legend of Damon Bailey, and the so-called \\"Crime Against Culture\\" (Indiana's universally despised move away to four-class basketball in 1998).  It's a well-reported travelogue that gives the reader a flavor of how basketball culture is changing in even the most traditional of settings.	2005-06-25

Frankly, there's not much of a story here.  I think even each of the five-star reviewers on these pages would attest to that.<br /><br />What there is, however, is wonderful insight on the medical profession, especially regarding the dynamics and motivations of ICU care.  For anyone in medicine, or even for someone who has a good friend or relative in the profession, \\"Critical Care\\" is a must-read.  For those who live the life depicted in Dooling's book, there will surely be laughs, head-shaking assents and the occassional exclamatory \\"Yes!\\"<br /><br />Where this book also excels is in its depictions of where the medical and legal professions intersect.  In fact, the hospital's in-house counsel has some wonderful things to say to the book's protagonist, Peter Werner Ernst, about 'the truth':<br /><br />\\"You must understand that in any litigation conducted by competent attorneys the truth will come out; it's only a matter of when.  you must also understand that it is far better for both you and the Medical Center if the truth comes out sooner rather than later.\\"<br /><br />\\"Cross-examination can be a very unpleasant experience, even for a witness who is telling the truth.  Successfully telling lies is almost impossible.  Lies change.  The truth does not change.  If the honest witness gets confused during questioning, he or she need only remember the truth and cling to it and give the same, consistent answers to every question, even questions for which the witness is unprepared.  If the witness is not telling the truth, his or her story will change.  A good lawyer will easiliy detect that change and will let the witness go on changing the story.  Then the lawyer will confront the witness with each change and ask him to explain it.  In his panic, the witness can't cling to the truth because he is lying under oath, which is a crime.  More changes inevitably appear.  Then, as you can imagine, things get worse...It can be a humiliating experience.\\"<br /><br />Not only is that superlative writing, it's also about the most spot-on writing on that subject I've ever encountered.  I was recently a witness to a cross-examiniation in which that exact sequence of events unfolded.  A witness got tripped up in a key lie  - he told it once in the morning depostion, then messed it up when trying to re-tell that afternoon.  When the lawyer pounced on those differences, it wasn't a pretty sight.  The truth would have been a far more effective strategy.

'Everything Is Illuminated' is that book - a seemingly impossible-to-pull-off-but-somehow-he-did-it blend of wildly inventive humor and dread horror, horror that plumbs the depths of human depravity.  The talent who assembled this stunning tale - Jonathan Safran Foer - was only 24 at the time of publication.  It's a stunning debut that literally set the publishing world on its ear.<br /><br />Prior to the book, however, was a short story version published in the New Yorker.  Liev Schreiber bought the rights to that story, wrote the screenplay (with feedback from JSF), and directed it.  Look for it in big screen release in August 2005.  I'd recommend reading the book prior to the movie (I love being able to sit in the the theater and compare the two versions as the film goes along).<br /><br />By the way, this Statistically Impossible Phrases ('SIPs') feature that amazon has added is superb!  For 'Illuminated' we're provided with the following SIPs, which wonderfully evoke the reading experience of the book:<br /><br />petrol man<br /><br />premium person<br /><br />his fanny pack<br /><br />abacus bead<br /><br />witnessed anyone<br /><br />famous nightclub<br /><br />dead arm<br /><br />white string<br /><br />For those of you who have read the book:  is that a perfect list or what?<br /><br />For example, that 'witnessed anyone' are two words of a phrase ('Have you ever witnessed anyone in this photograph?') uttered repetitively by Ukranian translator 'Alex' during what I think is the book's standout scene.  It's three pages that riveted me and caused me to re-read it five or six times to soak in all the emotion.	2005-05-04

Kudos as well to Eichenwald for recognizing that the key journalism was performed by a gutsy Bethany McLean of Fortune (who would not be cowed by attempts to intimidate her) and Wall Street Journal reporters John Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith, whose work uncovering the SPEs was instrumental in forcing accountability after years of deception.<br /><br />The masterstroke of the book is in Eichenwald's decision to center it around the evil perpetrated by Andy Fastow and associate Michael Kopper.  These two then set out to co-opt key indivduals with investment returns from LJM participation that is tantamount to a bribe.  From that point, they begin to control both sides of the negotiation table as assets slide on and off the Enron balance sheet.  A key Eichenwald line: Enron employees always wondered whether it was Fastow that corrupted Kopper, or Kopper that corrupted Fastow.  Read the book and you'll be asking that question yourself.  The public now feels it knows Fastow well, but Kopper is a piece of work.<br /><br />One thing that is clear from Eichenwald's account is his Woodward-like use of sources.  And, if Kurt Eichenwald wants to interview you, one word of advice: accept.  It's pretty easy from reading the book who got interviewed and who didn't.  You're better off getting your say.<br /><br />Which brings us to the book's most controversial aspect: the portrayal of Jeff Skilling.  From some of the stories told, it's obvious Eichenwald spoke at length to Skilling and fiancee Rebecca Carter.  The portrayal of Skilling isn't altogether pleasant: the dude sounds seriously unhinged, certainly not a man ever again to helm a public company.  But in terms of culpability in the Fastow/Kopper schemes, Eichenwald gives Skilling a fair degree of backing for his alibi: that he was in the dark in regards to the depths of deception inherent in the SPEs.  And that's bound to upset a lot of hard-working, decent Enron employees who got the bum's rush out of the company through no fault of their own.again to helm a public company.

US	53092367	R37SCGLANB6V14	037571409X	870481550	Train	Books	3	12	16	N	N	Good writing, but an empty taste in my mouth	I bought 'Train' on a whim at Barnes and Noble, based in part on the moody black & white cover, the back-of-the-book description of 'high-stakes matches' in 1953 featuring a 'black caddy' who is also a 'golf prodigy.' I also fell for the cover note that 'Train' was the 'Winner of the National Book Award Winner.'<br /><br />Oops.  Cancel that.  I was taken in by Vintage Contemporaries' little sleight of hand.  It's *Mr. Dexter* (for a previous work), not 'Train,' that was bestowed that award.  Looking at the cover now, I see it reads 'train | pete dexter' and that the 'Winner' blurb is lined up to the right of that divider line.  Subtle, no?  But disingenuous nevertheless (I see a couple of other reviewers on these pages were a bit perturbed by this technique as well).<br /><br />Regardless, there's very good writing here.  I was left with the distinct impression of the hardness of growing up African-American in Los Angeles in 1953.  Dexter's subtle shift in the dialect of his telling as he shifts from one character to another is superbly done.  And his pacing - shifting from 20+ page set-up chapters to punchy two- to three-page bursts by the book's mid-section - is exemplary.<br /><br />What turned me off about 'Train' was Dexter's lack of any sort of denouement on all but one thread he had woven into the story.  Melrose English, Mayflower, Train's mother, Mr. Cooper and susan (no caps), Sweet's motivation, the Darktown Standard...I sped towards the ending to find out how all these pieces were going to fit, and was left with quite an empty taste in my mouth.	2005-04-09

Rubin's style is dry, understated, and self-deprecating, and that comes across in the book.  In fact, I bought \\"In an Uncertain World\\" at the same time as Monica Langley's profile of Sandy Weill (\\"Tearing Down the Walls\\") and they are about as unlike as two books can be (given that that Langely's book reflects the rollicking life and outsized ego of Weill...and I mean that in a complimentary way).<br /><br />Frankly, Rubin's work is a tough cover-to-cover read for someone not juiced up about learning all the workout details of, for example, stanching the Asian financial contagion, circa 1998.  But, I will say that two chapters - \\"Political Education\\" and \\"A White House Life\\" ought to be required reading for anyone about to accept an Administration post.  It's a primer on inquisitive learning and subtle use of power.  It also reflects highly on Bill Clinton's stewardship of the economy.  Rubin has great insight on the traits that made Clinton so effective...and, at other times, so maddening.<br /><br />I say Rubin is self-deprecating.  Here's why: he spends a lot of time downplaying his influence on the President.  In essence, he's reporting \\"Hey, Clinton is a smart guy and realized that good (economic) policy is good politics.\\"  But, if you've read Bob Reich's contemporaneous account (the far more inviting \\"Locked in the Cabinet\\"), you know that from other perspectives around the Administration's main table, Rubin's impact was enormous.  Reich all but accuses him of subverting Clinton's 'true' (from Reich's viewpoint) agenda: a panolopy of progressive program visions Reich says he and Clinton had developed and shared since their days at Oxford.  The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle (after all, Reich wrote from the perspective of a quasi-jilted lover).  Juxtaposing these two accounts is an interesting exercise.ing exercise.	2005-04-05

Red Sox Are The Champions After 86 Years	Books	1	18	18	N	N	Pathetic, weak effort - someone ought to be fired over this	So, after 86 years, the Red Sox finally break through.  And, for this special, long-awaited moment, does the once-august Boston Globe take the time to lovingly, painstakingly put together a keepsake for its maniacly devoted fans?  No.  Instead it puts out a complete and utter piece of dreck.  Someone at the Globe or publisher Triumph Books - perhaps the entire team charged with assembling this gaffe - ought to be fired.  Shame on you.<br /><br />This book simply was not edited, fact-checked, reviewed, verified or even given the simplest 'once over.' Even a quick read-through should have caused even the most junior editor at the Globe/Triumph to ask that the presses be stopped.<br /><br />Reviewer Arthur Weeks has compiled a great list and it gives you an idea of just how egregious these errors are - missing box scores, earned runs in shutouts, St. Louis scoring four runs in the ninth inning of a game they lost 6 - 2.  You can't make this stuff up.<br /><br />Here's a couple of more:<br /><br />- On pages 26 - 27, two pictures claim to show Larry Walker (p. 26) and Jeff Suppan (p. 27) making baserunning blunders.  In fact, both pictures are of Walker - different angles, but it's clearly Number 33 in both shots (and Suppan was wearing a warm-up jacket as I recall).<br /><br />- On page 86, they bollix up the name of the very guy who coined the term 'Curse of the Bambino': the Globe's own Dan Shaughnessy, who here becomes Dan Shaugnessy.<br /><br />Furthermore, the box scores are of the variety that appeared in your small, local paper circa 1969.  They've got about 25% of the content of a box score that appears today in USA Today and most other corners of the statistics-crazed world of baseball.  These box scores offer the reader next to no insight on the game.<br /><br />One other metric to give you an idea of how thin the gruel is: the marketing blurb provided on these pages (no doubt provided by Triumph) says the book is filled with 'hundreds of color photos.'  The book, in fact, has exactly 79 photos. And I'm being lenient here by including the front and back cover images and one page that contains six 1.75\\" x 3\\" photo head shots of various players.<br /><br />In short: pathetic.<br /><br />It's a crying shame.

Author Paul Nielsen is completely deserving of the kudos he's getting on these pages.  I find there are examples of everything I'm looking for buried somewhere in this book.<br /><br />The operative word being 'buried.'  There's the rub.  My only complaint about the book is something the author had no control over: the quality of the index.  In these types of reference books, you're completely dependent on the index to lead you to the proper place in the book.  I find my hit rate is about 50% or so.  In general, the tack of the Bible series is to aggregate items in the index into topics like 'code,' 'data,' 'design,' language,' 'model' (you get the idea) while the reader (this reader, at least) is looking for an arrangement that is a bit more pratical.<br /><br />Despite this shortcoming, Nielsen's book is one you'll keep close by your side as your navigate the depths of SQL Server.	2005-03-30

Still, though, it's tough to belittle in any fashion the work of a man who - as he notes late in the book - has just witnessed his 27th revolution in 'the Third World' (and I want to make clear it is the author, not the reviewer, that consigned the Iran of 1979 - 1980 to that category).<br /><br />This short book (no more than a couple of hours' read) does have a some insightful things to say about power, most notably how to abuse it, and how to squander it.  And, for those wondering how Iran could shake off the shackles of plutocracy/kleptocracy and plunge into theocracy, Kapuscinski pithily comments:<br /><br />\\"The Shah left people a choice between Savak and the mullahs.  And they chose the mullahs...It is not always the best people that emerge from hiding...but often those that have proven themselves strongest, not always those who will create new values but rather those whose thick skin and internal resiliance have ensured their survival.\\"<br /><br />Towards the end of the book (originally published in Polish in 1982 and first translated into English in 1985), pessimism sets in with Kapuscinski as he notes \\"the conservative hardliners gradually gained the upper hand over the enlightened and open ones.\\"  But, as he points out \\"a democracy cannot be imposed by force, the majority must favor it, yet the majority wanted what Khomeini wanted - an Islamic republic.\\"	2005-03-22

That's not meant as a slam.  I'm pointing it out because it allows you to skip some chapters that might not be your cup of tea (I skipped the chapter on Castro's would-be assassin, for example, and was still able to follow the narrative thread without missing a beat).<br /><br />The author and her editors here do someone that I love to see in a book:  there's an awesome guide to your reading that appears prior to Chapter One:  a family tree of Fidel Castro; another of the Gonzalez family; and a third depicting photos of \\"the 15 passangers on the boat of Elian Gonzalez.\\"  It's hard to underestimate just how important these charts are to your reading.<br /><br />This book incites (very) strong opinions.

You bet.	The top business journalists in the world are the ones that research and pen the groundbreaking Page A1 stories in The Wall Street Journal.  The Journal breaks these stories over and over again, and other news organizations simply trail in their wake.  Monica Langley is one of these trailblazers.  In 'Tearing Down the Walls,' she expands upon a lengthy Page A1 profile she had written about Sandy Weill and details his Horatio Alger story.<br /><br />The title refers to how Weill \\"had torn down one wall after another - barriers based on religion, class, even the law - to get to where he was.\\"  The cover blurbs refer to this book as 'riveting' (Forbes) and 'rollicking' (The Economist).  That seems close to impossible for a business book, but 'Walls' is a well-written tale of a larger-than-life character.  You'll blast through these 438 pages effortlessly.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that based on Langley's reporting, Chuck Prince earned his stripes and was duly rewarded in getting tabbed as Weill's successor.  And, Bank One (and now Chase) made a great choice in naming Jamie Dimon as its CEO.  Dimon leaps off the page as the Crown Prince of Wall Street. Langley is clearly taken with the guy's obvious charisma and skills (Dimon seems to have this effect on everyone throughout the course of the book).	2005-03-07

It covers Fishman's attempted transition from journalist to entrepreneur, intermingled with essay-like takes by Fishman on business today.  Those pieces feature some trenchant (and funny) observations on the likes of Fast Company, Tom (the spitter) Peters, The Brand Called You and other late-90s business phenomena.<br /><br />Where the book really excels is in Fishman's recounting of his attempts to breathe life into Karaoke Nation concept.  What I love is his recounting of the interactions between himself and advisors/partners-to-be Steve Reynolds (aptly called \\"Consigliere\\" thoughout the book by Fishman), web guru Peter Clemente and Oddcast CEO Adi Sideman.  It's really fabulous writing.  Hopefully, these three are happy with the way they've been depicted.  I think Fishman has drawn each of them in a very positive light.<br /><br />Other high points include meetings with hip hop entrepreneurs Russell Simmons and Chuck D.  Fishman has a real ear and eye for what his readers want to hear out of those interactions.<br /><br />I do take exception to the comment by another reviewer saying \\"of course the business failed.\\"  Not true.  What did happen is that the entire Internet craze got pulled out from under Fishman and his circle (they tried to bring this live in the 1999 - 2000 timeframe).  And, Fishman does have a completed product he can point to...see karaoke.oddcast.com for a licensed version of the technology.  You can actually go there and record a karaoked version of 'The Tide Is High' and a small number of other tunes.  It's pretty slick technology.  Fishman got his vision into a product.

Symmes' work is now getting a well deserved bump due to Walter Salles' recent release of the 'The Motorcycle Diaries.'<br /><br />I really enjoyed this work and consider it to be three different books, all intertwined in one compelling narrative:<br /><br />- There's Symmes' attempts to reconcile the diaries of both Guevara and Granado to what he sees on his trip.  He's done a lot of good research here.  Many times, he'd roll into a small town, suss it out, and tell a proprietor \\"Che stayed here.\\"  Invariably, this revelation would bowl the guy over.  Then, they'd set out together to prove the point, usually successfully.<br /><br />- There's the story of Symmes' journey itself.  This is the surprise - his tale is almost equally compelling...undertaking a 10,000 mile solo journey using his developing Spanish, Symmes deals with injury, depravation, arduous Andes crossings, flat tires in the middle of nowhere, and vast streches of nothingness in the Chilean desert.  His fortitude is extremely impressive, as are his journalistic instincts, which get him the right interview time after time.  This is true right to the very end, where an epilogue finds in the living room of Alberto Granado in Havana, sipping (no, slugging down) rum and questioning the old man about the discrepancies between the travelers' diaries.  \\"Who saved the kitten?\\" asks Symmes.  Wonderful stuff.<br /><br />- The third component is what sets this book apart from the average travelogue: Symmes is journalist first, traveler second.  What that means is that in each country he goes through, we get an outstanding discourse on the current (1996) issues  and recent history of that land.  So, for example, we get heady passages about Allende, Pinochet, and Orlando Letelier in Chile. And the Shining Path, Montesinos and Fujimori while in Peru.  In Bolivia, you read about the dynamics of that society, including a very insightful piece on just why Guevara failed there.  All in all, very impressive work.<br /><br />The one major thing that needs to be pointed out:  contrary to what you may think about a book of this nature, this in no Che-worshipping hagiography.  To the contrary, Symmes spares no detail in covering what he considers to be Guevara's flailings and failings in Bolivia.  The Che of Bolivia comes across in Symmes hand as inept and, most notably, damned by an extreme case of hubris.  To paraphrase a joke Symmes tells, Guevara's dream ended in Bolivia not of heroic action, but because of \\"suicide caused by jumping off one's own ego.\\"  It's an unsparing book.eady passages about Allende, Pinochet, and Orlando Letelier in Chile.

Count me on the side of those who subscribe to the latter theory.  Exhibit A is Doug Collins.  Exhibit B, Kurt Rambis.  Those two coaches had the same material in Chicago and LA respectively.  Neither one has a ring to show it.  In this book, Phil Jackson shows what sets him apart from other coaches - great interpersonal skills, a sixth sense for detecting a team's mood and energy, an ability to play the angles (e.g., knowing just how many minutes to squeeze out of a Shaq on a particular night).  It takes more than good players to win nine championships.  Phil Jackson's innate intelligence has always been the difference-maker.<br /><br />Don't expect juicy or salacious gossip here.  The coach clearly doesn't traffic in gossip-mongering.  There are good insights into the Shaq-Kobe thing though.  It's clear Phil is endeared to Shaq; frustrated (disgusted?) with Kobe.  He's got a great take on the key difference between the two:  You ask Shaq to do something, he might argue, but eventually he will do as asked; ask Kobe to do something, he says 'Yes,' then never does it (and clearly never intended to).<br /><br />There's interesting light shed here on the character of Kobe Bryant.  The only thing left to amaze us is how this man fooled us all for so long.  Jackson reports that in speaking with the player's Dad, ex-NBA-er Joe \\"Jelly Bean\\" Bryant, he is told that the defining characteristic of Kobe's youth was anger.  That's a constant theme throughout the book.  Shaq touches on it perfectly during his 'exit interview' with Jackson.  He says (in essence) that Kobe's always searching for a way to become happy, but he'll never get there.<br /><br />The other neat thing about this book is the picture of Jackson at the podium after the Game 5 Finals loss, flanked by four of his five children.  As he notes in the book, he had shielded their privacy throughout his career.  Now, as he was going out, he introduced them to the public for the first time.  They're great-looking kids, obviously very supportive and protective of their Dad.  It's a wonderful photo that you'll look at again and again as you read the book.en.

These were published in serial form in a leading Japanese magazine and are collected in print here.  As Murakami notes, the original book treated Aum as a \\"black box.\\"  He tries to add some definition here.<br /><br />- The translators - Alfred Birnbaum and Philip Gabriel - have done a tremendous job here making the text come alive and give it the conversational tone that Murakami intended.  That manifests itself in two ways.  First, we get judiciously added footnotes from the translators.  For example, a reference is made to the \\"Matsumoto incident,\\" which the translators explain was an earlier sarin poisoning performed by Aum, but police investigators never successfully made the linkage.  This elucidation is key.  Second, the in-line transalation has great phrasing like \\"It was right out of the blue and caught me off guard,\\" \\"he was a whiz-bang do-it-your-selfer,\\" and \\"I put up with it for a year, then I threw in the towel.\\"  What a skill to be able to capture the essence of Murakami's Japanese and get it into such live, jump-off-the-page English.<br /><br />What I really liked about the book itself was the spoken, captured word of the victims and how they reveal the shortcomings in the way Japan works on a daily basis.  These themes will be familiar to anyone familiar with works like Alex Kerr's \\"Dogs and Demons\\" (these thoughts are all expressed by the victims themselves):<br /><br />- The police and fireman don't respond on time and victims are forced to rely on Good Samaritans and - at times - the Japanese media (their vehicles are commandered) to rush them for treatment.<br /><br />- The police also come under fire for not getting to the bottom of the earlier Matsumoto incident, despite some strong clues that Aum was involved.<br /><br />- The Japanese government has no systematic plan in place for the long-term treatment of the injured (who number in the thousands)<br /><br />- The transit authorities - on the day of the attacks - did not prevent access to the targeted railcars, well after it was obvious that people were dying in there.  Indeed, many of the victims are injured in a second or third wave of entry into the cars.  A jaw-dropping oversight.<br /><br />- There's a complete lack of information flow between the police and hospitals.  Hospital staff are forced to get their information from television reports.<br /><br />Murakami sums all this up very cleanly in his essay:<br /><br />\\"[This] nightmarish eruption...threw all our latent contradictions and weak points of our society into frighteningly high relief.  Japanese society proved all too defenseless against these sudden onslaughts.  We were unable to see them coming and failed to preapre.  Nor did we respond effectively.  Very clearly, 'our' side failed.\\"like Alex Kerr's \\"Dogs and Demons\\" (these thoughts are all expressed by the victims themselves):    - The police and fireman don't respond on time and victims are forced to rely on Good Samaritans and - at times - the Japanese media (their vehicles are commandered) to rush them for treatment.    - The police also come under fire for not getting to the bottom of the earlier Matsumoto incident, despite some strong clues that Aum was involved.    - The Japanese government has no systematic plan in place for the long-term treatment of the injured (who number in the thousands)    - The transit authorities - on the day of the attacks - did not prevent access to the targeted railcars, well after it was obvious that people were dying in there.  Indeed, many of the victims are injured in a second or third wave of entry into the cars.  A jaw-dropping oversight.    - There's a complete lack of information flow between the police and hospitals.  Hospital staff are forced to get their information from television reports.    Murakami sums all this up very cleanly in his essay:    \\"[This] nightmarish eruption...threw all our latent contradictions and weak points of our society into frighteningly high relief.  Japanese society proved all too defenseless against these sudden onslaughts.  We were unable to see them coming and failed to preapre.  Nor did we respond effectively.  Very clearly, 'our' side failed.\\"	2004-11-11
US	53092367	R2L53QMOLQAFLU	0968871550	49307822	The Athlete's Ball	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A must-have for anyone serious about exercise ball training	Rick Jemmett's work \\"The Athlete's Ball\\" is a must-have purchase for anyone that currently works out (or, *ought* to work out) with an exercise ball (aka, fitness ball, Swiss ball, etc.).  I've got a couple of books on this subject already on my shelf - \\"Bounce Your Body Beautiful\\" is nutritionist's take; \\"Get on the Ball\\" is from a fitness instructor.  Now comes Jemmett's take as a licensed Physical Therapist.  While I find all three books helpful in designing a workout, Jemmett's book stands alone as an impressive piece of scholarship, the source material from the book having been drawn from published research in anatomy, biomechanics, motor control, orthopedics, sports medicine and exercise physiology.  Jemmett credits no less than 70 works in his bibliography.<br /><br />The challenge here is to synthesize that wide body of work and boil it down into a presentation that doesn't perplex or put off the lay reader.  Jemmett is up to the challenge and you see that right away as he explains the concept of core muscles in the opening pages of the book.  Other works, in defining \\"the core,\\" either employ the term as a buzzword or give it some tautological definition like \\"the core is important in maintaining core stability.\\" By contrast, Jemmett gives us a very readable six-page intro to core muscles, their three primary functions (fascinating) and an explanation of why the core's complexities call for what he calls the 'specifity principle of training.'<br /><br />That solid beginning sets the stage for Jemmett's introduction to Integrative Training, which is the main thrust of \\"The Athlete's Ball.\\"  A quick flip through the book at the photos gives you a clue as to what that training entails - doing exercises that are specific to one's chosen sport - so, we see hockey players doing hockey-oriented exercises, dancers doing dancing-related things, etc.  But, what we *don't* see are the usual 'single muscle' exercises like crunches, oblique twists, etc.<br /><br />What the reader gets as a result is a book that is both a fresh take and an important complement to other books on the subject.  In my mind, designing an exercise ball workout that meets your goals is all about synthesizing advice passed down from others who have been successful with making the ball a key part of their exercise regimens.  From that perspective, \\"The Athlete's Ball\\" ought to be on your bookshelf today.br />What the reader gets as a result is a book that is both a fresh take and an important complement to other books on the subject.

However, I was very disappointed with \\"Who's Your Caddy?\\"  It's a great idea in concept, but while I certainly admire Reilly's gumption in getting some of the great gigs he describes in the book, \\"Caddy\\" is tripped up and sent into a messy pratfall by the writer's juvenile chapter on LPGA star Jill McGill.<br /><br />McGill probably thought that having Reilly as a caddy would result in good exposure for the LPGA (which, let's face it, needs it). Instead, she gets sandbagged by the author, and has to spend a good portion of her time fending off Reilly's obessesion (not too true strong of a word here) with the sexual preferences of the tour's fans and two of its top players. When Ms. McGill saw the way this chapter turned out in print, I guarantee you she was sick to her stomach and spent many hours apologizing to her fellow players.<br /><br />There are lots of other profiles in 'Caddy' that would otherwise be worthy of praise and comment.  In other circumstances, those would be what I remember and share here.  But Reilly's poor sportsmanship towards the LPGA has spoiled the work as a whole.	2004-11-01

Both book and movie build suspense to a slow boil as protagonist Antoine drinks, drives, drinks...and drnks some more.  As he does, resentment towards his more-successful wife H&eacute;l&egrave;ne builds and uncorks with bile.<br /><br />The movie's casting is what makes the adaptation of Simenon's work so successful - Jean-Pierre Darroussin (Antoine) is not exactly movie-star handsome and we've got no problem envisioning him as the office drone.  Carole Bouquet as H&eacute;l&egrave;ne is a different issue altogether - one of France's leading stage beauties, it's no wonder her character has met with more success.<br /><br />After building suspensefully, I thought book and movie ended up on a bit of unlikely happenstance - three characters drawn together through two events.  There are astronomical odds of these two things happening - coming out of the movie everyone was buzzing about the unlikeliness of this, which is too bad because that contrived turn of events was preceded by some wonderful movie-making and, in the case of Simenon's novel, some excellent writing.	2004-10-25

These are the eyes and ears of a seasoned campaign reporter.<br /><br />I especially liked the humor Shapiro shows - an extended riff towards the end of the book envisions each of the candidates as President and recounts their first days in autobiographical style - we get Kerry dictating a self-important passage to himself via a small tape recorder, a faux Time magazine article that makes the Edwards White House out as Camelot, Part II, with John-John and Caroline stand-ins Jack and Emma Claire Edwards leaving half-eaten cookies in the Oval Office.  Best of all, we get a hilariously spot-on passage from Senator Bob Graham's Presidential Diary.  Every political wonk and wonkette knows about Graham's prosiac, prolific diaries, so we get entries like:<br /><br />6:45 - Shower, shave, dress.  Finish Colgate.  Gray suit<br /><br />7:30 - CIA-FBI terrorism briefing.  Same old.  Counted \\"Mr. President's.\\"  47!  4 in one sentence.<br /><br />That's right out of Al Franken \\"Why Not Me?\\" terrritory.

It was simply a case of the Red Sox not measuring up to the Yankees on many benchmarks...managers (Grady Little trying to match wits against Joe Torre being only the latest example), ownership (Tom Yawkey's plantation mentality meant the Sox were the last team to integrate), team chemistry (the famous '25 cabs for 25 guys' line was written to describe the Yastrzemski-era Sox) and player personnel (the 70s teams, for example, featured bombers to take advantage of Fenway who could neither run, field, bunt nor sacrifice as well as their chief rivals).<br /><br />So, Dan Shaughnessy comes along post-1986 collapse with the trite, kitschy 'Curse of the Bambino' and suddenly every talking head in America has a little piece of pop psychology they can gear their stories around - witness, as an example, any recent Fox broadcast with shot after shot of Ruth 'ghosts' parading through the stands at Yankee Stadium.  Great visuals, cue it up between batters, between pitches...but why load these 25 current players with that extra-heavy burden?  'Curse' has been a healthy annuity for Shaughnessy, no doubt (and I give him some credit for the that), but from his Globe byline pulpit and his repeated intonations about The Curse, he has unwittingly become somewhat his home team's worst enemy (witness the venom on these pages as a confirmation of that opinion).<br /><br />What's different about 2003 and beyond is that the Henry/Lucchino/Epstein regime doesn't buy into this garbage.  They see baseball for what it is - a game of statistics, percentages and chances.  Get your numbers to the point where they are better than the competition, and more times than not your team is going to win.  They were smart enough to recognize that the Yankees were winning because they were demonstrably better.  They made a commitment to continuous improvement of the club using the Yankees as their benchmark.  Owner John Henry is one of the nation's most successful commodities and stock traders; President Larry Lucchino has a track record of improving franchises; GM Theo Epstein is a Moneyball/Bill James disciple and baseball talent-spotting prodigy.  I'm sorry that's not as mystical and compelling as Harry Frazee needing to finance 'No No Nanette' and Babe Ruth pushing a piano into a lake, but that's the truth.  For the first time in 86 years, the Red Sox - across the organization - are outworking and outthinking their competitors.  That's what we ought to be celebrating right now, not whether the Curse has been broken.their benchmark.

I loved Tattlin's book and so has everyone else who I've recommended it to.  Others may criticize it as being the boring diary of a housewife with not much to say, but I think that misses the point.  More than any other book I've read about Cuba, 'Diaries' seems to put you squarely in Havana by showing you the challenges of every day life.  Granted, Tattlin and family are not every day Cubans - she's quite frank about her life of (comparative) privilege...but she does give you a true sense of how all Cubans must survive on guile and wit.<br /><br />Additionally, I was fascinated by the way Tattlin chose to mask the identity of herself and husband 'Nick' described as being born in 'X' and then constantly referring to Nick's X-ian background, his X-ian associates, speaking X-ian to their children.  I know you're thinking - boy, that must be annoying.  It's not - I found myself intrigued and beguiled by the whole thing - trying to piece together what country it could possibly be (Eastern European is as close as I could come - and I'm not guaranteeing that's right).<br /><br />Plus, as an added bonus there's a dinner at the Tattlin's house with Fidel as a guest.  That chapter alone ought to make you buy the book - simply fascinating the details she imparts there...like Fidel arriving (in a phalanx of limos mind you) and immediately insisting on using the mirror as he enters the house.  He stands there combing his hair (for over a minute!) while the hired help looks on raptorously (and the Tattlins think \\"what the....\\"?).  There are tons of small observations like that one that make 'Diaries' a truly great read.	2004-10-21

Let's consider 'Why Not Me' a trial run for Al Franken's better written follow-up 'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.'  All of Franken's work bears the hallmarks of his sketch comedy background - it's an ensemble of pieces, some of which work, some of which don't.  In 'Lies,' roughly 80% or more of the pieces hit the mark (I wasn't a fan of the cartoons).  In 'Why Not Me,' it's about 50%.  Like the Bob Woodward parody ('The Void'), for example: funny for about the first five pages (you laugh when you see Franken's nailed Woodward's melodramatic scene-setting and habit of assembling conversations as if he were in the room).  But it drags on and on.  How many readers got though the whole piece?  Not many I bet.<br /><br />Like others, I agree that the campaign diary worked the best, followed closely by the faux Newsweek piece - the classic campaign shot of Franken chopping wood with Golden Retriever at his side is a howler.  Talk about spot-on.  I think the best part of the entire book is the 'one issue' campaign (elimination of ATM Fees) and how Candidate Franken steers all discussion back to that point.  Watching both Bush and Kerry try to route every question back to stump speech set pieces makes you realize that there's sometimes a fine line between parody and reality.	2004-10-20

Just looking at a single line and see an eye-popping 30 days in single country (not uncommon)...now multiply that times 116 countries.  Wow - what commitment and discipline.<br /><br />Everyone is going to have their favorite parts of the book, and for me it was the trek through Africa.  I found the traversing of Angola most interesting because of the way I was able to match it up with one of my all-time favorite books, Ryszard Kapuscinski's \\"Another Day of Life.\\"<br /><br />One of the best features of the book is Jim Rogers' blunt take on matters.  This guy worked with George Soros, made his money and cashed out at 37.  So, he owes no one.  As a result, you get an unvarished take on all sorts of matters like immigration (\\"open the gates\\"), NGOs (to say he despises them falls a bit short of capturing his distaste), gambling (strongly against - which leads to a good take on why investing is the antithesis of gambling), Pinochet (\\"clearly guilty of crimes against humanity\\"), Pemex ('an inefficient operation run by corrupt officials on bloated paychecks\\")...you get the idea.  There's chapter after chapter of red meat like that.<br /><br />'Aventure Capitalist' is really worth your time.	2004-10-12
US	53092367	RFDI3OMCHNCNL	0345380371	546668910	Rising Sun	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Sun's edginess loses its bite 12 years later	I think 'Rising Sun' is among Michael Crichton's finest works, but time hasn't been too kind to it.  With an early 1992 publication date (of the hardcover edition), it would have been conceived by Crichton during the height of the Japanese 'bubble economy.'  The U.S. was awash those days in fears of Japanese economic hegemony.  Various 'serious' books questioned whether the Japanese 'model' would supplant the US' as the dominant paradigm of the new century.  Crichton's book - a very-well written, suspenseful thriller - plays off of those fears.<br /><br />Well, a big 'oops' is in order here.  Turns out the Japanese economy was very (VERY) overheated and a bloated Nikkei (peaking at over 40,000 compared to today's tepid 10,000 - 12,000 range) masked what now appear to be fundamental issues with the Japanese model - the paralyzation casued by excessive corporate cross-ownership of shares, failure of banks to recognize even the most obvious non-paying loans, massive transportation projects concreting the entire country without rhyme or reason...the list goes on.  The upshot is an economy that has run - at best - sideways for 12 years or more.<br /><br />Kudos go now to Prime Minister Koizumi who really seems to be tackling these issues head-on and making good progress (most notably in bank reform).  But the effect of the last 12 years is to really take the steam out of edgy, confrontational books like 'Rising Sun', which is actually a critique of Japan itself masked as a thriller.  It's a shame because the book itself is quite a ride and a masterful novel of suspense.  I know it sounds like a tired cliche, but I literally couldn't put 'Rising Sun' down and read it straight through in one extended sitting.  If you do read it now, just remember that Crichton's book is predicated on the perception of Japanese power, circa 1989 - 1990.	2004-10-07

But, as the bet unfolds, there's a lesson to be learned here:  Tony set a goal for himself and - despite enduring significant hardship and many, many potential roadblocks - he inexorably works towards his goal.<br /><br />The emotional core of the book is the relationship Tony forms with his Moldovan host family in the capital of Chisinau.  Hawks tells of going to middle school with the family's daughter Elena as sort of a 'show and tell' object.  He's a great sport and recounts tales like that with great elan.<br /><br />The real treat though is his relationship with the family's teenage son Adrian, who starts off a bit standoffish and cool ('typical teenager' is how Hawks interprets it...no harm taken).  But Hawks breaks through one night as the two attend an opera together - at intermission, he has Adrian literally convulsed with laughter, wiping tears from eyes.  What a moment - Hawks recognizes it and conveys it beautifully to his readers.<br /><br />That's why the book's epilogue - a touching letter from Adrian - is so pitch-perfect.  Think this was some insipid quest that Hawks took on?  The lessons that Adrian took away from Tony's journey will tell you otherwise.  As Hawks himself concludes after reading the letter: \\"Now it all made a little more sense.\\"<br /><br />Exactly.  Well done, Tony.	2004-10-01

Connolly's 29-year-old nameless protagonist.  It's neat to see Connolly's writing stretch to 300+ pages while artfully avoiding ever having to drop the character name in there somewhere.<br /><br />And it's that writing that will keep you glued to 'Layer Cake' from the start.  It takes you a bit - especially the US-raised reader - to adjust to the writing style (replete with Cockney rhyming slang - \\"I don't have a Scooby\\" you find out is \\"I don't have a clue\\"....Scooby = Scooby Doo = clue), but once you do, it's an enthralling ride.<br /><br />Can't wait to see Matthew Vaughn - producer of Guy Ritchie's first two films - step into the director's chair on this one.  Connolly was smart to tab Vaughn as \\"one of the few people in Britain who could get my movie made.\\"  It promises to be a good pairing.	2004-09-24

There are sections entitled \\"Seated on the Ball,\\" \\"Standing with the Ball,\\" \\"Abs on the Ball,\\" etc.  You get the idea.  It's brilliant in its simplicity.  Similar books have been arranged with different categorization ideas in mind.  None are as successful as Westlake's.<br /><br />I also love the consistency and cleanliness with which each individual exercise is presented: two pages apiece, with sections detailing Starting Position, Action, Decrease the Challenge, Increase the Challenge, Trainer Tips, as well as a related stretch.  There's also a nice duotone picture of the exercise.  One small quibble - nicely pointed out by another reader here on these pages - is that there's only one picture of the exercise.  Applegate's book (and others) give you two pictures, which really ought to be a requirement to give you an idea of the action of the exercise.  One picture doesn't suffice.<br /><br />My only true complaint - a constant theme with other readers - is one that Westlake had no say over: while the book looks great (it really stands out on the bookshelf) the binding won't withstand a lot of opening and closing and sweaty usage...which doesn't make sense at all, given that this is a book you'll want to refer to and toss around during your workout.  Someone at the publisher should have given the packaging decision a little more thought.	2004-09-10

It's incredible writing from a master storyteller who knows just what - and what not - to reveal at the just the right moment.  When I first dived into it, my thinking was \\"gee, the writing's a little stilted and dated.\\"  However, I found it took a couple of pages to set your mind to what it must have been like reading this when it came out in 1959 during the height of Cold War paranoia, \\"The Red Menace,\\" just coming out of McCarthyism, etc.  In that context, \\"Candidate\\" is breathtaking.<br /><br />The real triumph of the re-release is the very insightful introduction by Louis Menard.  It does a fabulous job of placing the book and the 1962 movie into historical context, as well as giving you some background on Condon himself.  Menard calls Condon an earlier day Michael Crichton, in the sense that the two possess enough movie-making savvy that their books \\"practically provide camera angles.\\"<br /><br />Here's my one piece of advice though:  read closely enough, Menard's introduction delves into one or two key plot points.  True, most readers will know the plot going in, but I think the intelligent reader will be better served diving straight into Condon's story and saving the intro for a post-book treat.  I read it before and after, and I was struck by how much more meaningful Menard's various contextual points were after the book's contents were lodged firmly in my memory banks.	2004-09-10

To those who know de Soto's work, the solutions are well known: build a system of laws that allow one's residents to buy, sell and value property rights; and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business.<br /><br />If you've read de Soto's master work \\"The Mystery of Capitalism,\\" then there is no new news here.  In fact, \\"The Other Path\\" will look out-of-date with its yellowing statistics.  So why the five stars?  As a testament to de Soto's bravery.

According to de Soto, it's a well-defined system of property laws that allows individuals to unlock their accumulated value.  In general, de Soto shows that permanently downtrodden societies:<br /><br />a) Make it very difficult to buy, sell and value property rights.<br /><br />b) Create all sorts of byzantine barriers to anyone who wants to start a business.<br /><br />The key to de Soto's work is the empirical evidence he and his team accumulate.  The book is rich with examples from de Soto's native Peru and other countries like Egpyt.  In fact, de Soto is working with Gamal Mubarak (son of the President) in Egypt to implement many of these ideas.  Bill Clinton is also a big supporter of de Soto's.<br /><br />Some of the reading here is dry and stilted, but it's worth wading through those passages to grab the gist of de Soto's thesis.  This is an important publication that you'll see menationed time and time again over the next decade.	2004-08-21

As such, this book - a quick, worthhwhile read - is a good primer for the U.S.-based reader in gaining insight as to how that system of government works.<br /><br />In terms of painting the picture of how Blair and team (and mostly Blair, by the way) made its way towards partnership with the US in the actions in Iraq, there's a better source: Peter Stothard's \\"Thirty Days\\" is by far the better insider's view of that process.  However, Stothard's book is emphatically not a biography.  So, if you want insights on the roots and rise of Tony Blair - especially vis-a-vis his complex relationship with PM-in-waiting Gordon Brown - Stephens' book will suit you fine.  [Although Stephens' himself goes on to suggest other sources that cover specific topics better than he, most notably James Naughtie's \\"The Rivals,\\" which covers the Blair/Brown saga in splendorific detail.]<br /><br />A couple of annoying editing mistakes are worth noting. Inner-circle confidant Alastair Campbell is repeatedly called 'Alistair.'  I fault the editors here - this is a main character (he dominates \\"Thirty Days\\").  Sure, 'Alastair' is a non-conventional spelling, but the man deserves to have his name spelled correctly.  Also, Spainard Javier Solana - head of NATO at the time of that organization's actions in Kosovo - becomes Xavier Solana.  Charo was apparently unavailable for comment.	2004-08-18

But I'm certainly not alone in my opinion that 'Into the Wild' will always be Krakauer's best work.  While a compelling story in its own right, let's not overlook the masterful reporting required by the author in piecing together the last couple of years of Christopher McCandless' short, confused life.  It's a very impressive, comprehensive effort.<br /><br />I also like the way Krakauer - without any sense of self aggrandizement - is able to draw parallels between McCandless and his own period as 'The Angry Young Man,' going off on (retrospectively) foolish solo mountain climbs.<br /><br />As pointed out by others on these pages, I read this book over six years ago, but recall passages of it with a clarity that I can't claim for any other reading experience.  Isn't that what every writer strives to do?	2004-08-05

In terms of this book in particular, I came to know about it an odd way - Dr. Applegate was injured in a bizarre incident in which her shoulder was torqued by a radio talk show host who had somehow engaged her in an impromtu, on-air arm wrestling contest (Applegate makes a veiled reference to the incident in the book's intro).<br /><br />Anyway, for those following the saga, the book was an outcome of the changes she was forced to make to her exercise routine to accomodate the injury.  Certainly not the typical path to authorship, but I'm pleased this book made it to the market.<br /><br />While the text of the book is geared towards women readers, I'll point out that these are exercises and routines that can benefit both sexes.  Using the ball as your anchor simply takes the drudgery out of what used to seem like work.  Even achieving a sense of balance on some of the recommended routines is a challenge and a workout in itself.  The exercises are clearly described, and the accompanying pictures really help you envision what you need to do once you're over the ball trying to put an idea into practice.<br /><br />Frankly, to date I've ignored the sections of the book concerning nutrition (about half the content) and focused solely on the exercises.  That's the only reason why this book gets four stars instead of five.  I'd rather have paid half the price to get the half of the book that corresponds directly to the title.  The nutrition part seems like an ill-fitting add-in to me (although I'm sure some readers will appreciate its presence).	2004-07-30

When experts compile the 100 seminal books of the last century, Lewis' Wall Street tale might well be on it. It's that good.<br /><br /> That's a lot to live up to here, but 'Moneyball' delivers. Even if you're not much of a baseball fan here (heck, even Lewis admits he's never been much of a fan), this is compelling, enjoyable reading. Maybe a bit too slavish in its admiration of Billy Beane, but other than that, its very insightful. It's obvious that Lewis sees the parallels between computer jocks like Beane's trusty right-hand man, Paul DePodesta and the young 'quants' who began to dominate Wall Street trading in the 80s. It's a very apropos analogy.<br /><br /> I do suggest that you get the paperback. The updated epilogue to the paperback edition was published as a standalone piece in Sports Illustrated and it recounts the brutal backlash to the book from lifetime baseball 'insiders.' There's a wonderful story Lewis recounts about Joe Morgan, who - in disparaging both the book and Beane - is recounted as saying in interviews 'When Billy Beane writes a book like that...'<br /><br /> Meaning, of course, Morgan - picking up the spiel of the insiders - hadn't even read the book before launching these intellectually dishonest attacks. Nice. Anyway, the epilogue lets you in on these wars, which are equally - if not more - fascinating as the original publication.	2004-07-28

Newman was legendary back then for commandeering the kitchen of restaurants he would frequent and whipping together his own salad dressings.  He and co-founder Hotchner make light of their lack of business knowledge, but it's worth noting that much of their success is based on their innate sense of what is right, for example their unwillingness to compromise on the freshness of their product.<br />The latter third of the book details the duo's efforts in starting up the 'Hole in the Wall Gang' camps for sick children.  The authors are passionate about this endeavour, as well they should be.  It's outstanding work they're doing.  Newman personally drives these projects, sometimes through the force and magnetism of his personality.<br />In fact, that's the thing that stands out in the book - this is no 'slap the celebrity name on the bottle' exercise.  These two gentlemen are intimately involved in all aspects of the business.  There's a comparison in the book to other celebrity food bits good bad - Frank Sinatra's tomato sauce venture is one example.  It ran aground in less then two years, an unmitigated disaster.  The difference?  Sinatra simply loaned out his name and looked to scoop up the profits.  By contrast, Newman and Hotchner are in this thing heart and soul.  Plus, the product is superlative.  That's the only way to get repeat buyers.<br />As of the book's printing, Newman's Own has donated over $137 million to charity.  When they write Paul Newman's epitaph, that first paragraph is going to be a real stemwinder to capture the essence of the man.	2004-07-12

And, with 2,847 reviews here and counting, I think it's clear that &quot;Lies...&quot; has done the job.<br />I've been a fan of Al Franken's brand of humor since his first appearances on SNL with partner Tom Davis (by the way, whatever happened to Tom Davis?), the 'Al Franken Decade' and then - after a hiatus - his return to the show which included, among other things, some dead-on impersonations of politicians like Paul Simon (&quot;It's the bow tie, right?&quot;) and Pat Robertson.  It's clear Franken has a political jones that won't go away.<br />Regardless of your political stripe, you've got to give Franken credit for the work that went into this book: marshalling a team of 14 over a two-year period, this is no hack, slap-and-paste effort.

Through luck and hard effort, he then got himself paired up with a larger-than-life Wall Street investment banker looking to make his mark as 'Mr. China.'<br />After rigorously looking at hundreds and hundreds of potential investments, the two of them raise over $400 million and begin to put the cash to work in a series of JVs.  In what should be a cautionary tale to anyone looking to invest or do business in China, Clissold describes - in rather remarkable detail - the unique 'challenges' they encounter in making a return on their investment.  Clissold wisely focuses on three episodes - each involving plant managers or owners - where the Western and Chinese views of banking and contract law begin to diverge...then unravel.  Can Tim and team keep it together?  It'll require superhuman effort.  I was exhausted simply reading some of these chapters.  I can only imagine the stress and strain of actually living it.  Indeed, at one point Clissold's body seems to simply give out.  This, however, is not a man easily defeated.<br />Despite the travails Clissold faces in the book, the book is all about the potential of China.  He brings life to the sheer numbers and masses of people - his description of Chongqing for example (how many people know that this is China's largest city?)...&quot;The density of people was staggering: millions and millions swirling in the roadways, all in faded blue overalls and with piles of baggage, blocking the gates at the station, crammed into buses, milling about on the pavements.&quot;<br />Wonderful writing, made all the better by the pithy little proverbs that Clissold has chosen to begin each chapter.  I stared at each of these for a minute or more, admiring their brevity, significance and - upon finishing the chapter - realizing how apt Clissold's choices were.  Well done, Tim.im.	2004-07-06

The author is stone-cold honest about his history - morphing from a poor kid in Brooklyn to Columbia Law graduate to &quot;Jimmy Olsen greenhorn&quot; in the music business to master business builder to *the* out-of-control legendary wildman of the music business to abrupt sobriety to betrayal, fall, a period in the wilderness and redemption.  What a tale.<br />Where else are you going to get insights on Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Marvin Gaye and Mick Jagger mixed with equally eye-opening passages on Tom Wyman, Norio Ohga, Akio Morita and Bill Paley?<br />The Paley passages are especially enlightening - the controlling, secretive builder of the Tiffany network and the wildman of CBS/Columbia records were as unlikely a pairing as you could imagine, but Paley appreciated Yetnikoff's undeniable ability to make money and, as Paley says upon taking his leave from CBS, &quot;in this office, that did not go unnoticed.&quot;<br />Despite Yetnikoff's well-documented demons, his track record in the business is unassaible:  when he left, CBS/Columbia was still pulling in $450 million a year in *net* profits.  True, Yetnikoff's successors had to deal with a more vexing set of assaults on the recorded music business model, but you need to give the guy his due.	2004-06-30

It's everything you'd ever want in fiction - enthralling, heart-rending, educational.  You'll learn more about Afghanistan in Hosseini's book than you will in similar works of non-fiction.  For example, I know that there was an Afghani fascination with kites (news reports focused on this when the country began to open up again after the fall of the Taliban).  But I never understood it until reading 'The Kite Runner.'  Hosseini explains it brilliantly, vibrantly.  The way it ties together the protagonists here - well, it sends shivers up my spine simply recalling it as I write here about it.<br />The first chapter of this book is the best writing I've ever seen - three sparse, sparkling paragraphs (the entire length of the chapter) set the stage for the book.  Its true beauty is slowly revealed as you make your way through the book.  Each time I completed another chapter, I'd go back and re-read the first chapter and realize that the meaning of another sentence had been revealed.  What a thrilling reading experience.  I pray 'The Kite Runner' get turned into a movie (it has been optioned by Dreamworks).	2004-06-20

As US prosecutors have explained in their dogged attempts to nail down a case against Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, &quot;If WorldCom was arithmetic, then Enron is advanced calculus.&quot;  Despite the inherent complexity of Enron's downfall (derivatives, SPEs, mark-to-market accounting, and 'pre-paids' all figure heavily here), Robert Bryce tells a compelling, gripping tale.<br />Bryce's reporting mixes the personalities (all the main ones are covered here - Skilling, Lay, Rebecca Mark, Ken Rice, Lou Pai, Andy Fastow, Michael Kopper, etc.) and the financial details.  Bryce's mastery is he gives you a flavor for shady dealings like Fastow-created partnerships such as the now notorious LJM1 and LJM2.  He explains their intent, references a chart that speaks to their inherent complexity, winks at the reader (hey, he says, obfuscation was the point here), and then points to their fatal flaws (e.g., Fastow sitting on both sides of the table, financial solvency based upon a constantly-rising stock price, etc.)<br />Bryce is a reporter that can interweave facts like that with delicious stories of Rebecca Mark's high dollar globetrotting, replete with obscene private plane trips - often flying her, alone, to far-flung locales - and wonderfully evocative stories of her making speeches to water works executives...and dramatically flinging off her full-length sable coat as she ascends to the stage.  Well, any hack writer can't pull that off.  Pipe Dreams is a combination of good old-fashioned reporting (200+ interviews) and great writing chops.  In short, it's a great read.	2004-05-15

I end up reading a couple of works of fiction per year.  For the 2004 calendar year to date, it's this book by Allison Pearson, which I found to be charming and clever.  Unlike some reviewers, I found all the events contained in here believable.<br />Pearson really has her finger on the differing attitudes of co-workers regarding a woman and man's involved parenting.  Protagonist and narrator Kate Reddy puts up with a constant barrage of inquisition, rolled eyes and backoffice plotting each time parenting needs infringe on her growing work responsibilities.  Meanwhile, she notes with contempt that a Scottish co-worker is \\"almost knighted on the spot\\" when he takes early departure from a meeting to attend one of his kid's school recitals (\\"Oooh, you're such a hands-in parent\\" coos one admirer).<br />The web is rife with reports that Pearson's book been optioned for a movie with Nicole Kidman as Reddy, directed by Anthony Minghella (who oversaw her in 'Cold Mountain').  That might work, although 'English Patient' auteur Minghella seems a serious touch for this book.  And I guess I had an image of Emma Thompson in my head, thanks to her similar role with two small kids in Richard Curtis' recent \\"Love Actually.\\"  [Thompson has the comedic chops to pull this off as well.]	2004-04-17

A stirring, historic Masters concluded a few hours ago.  Phil Mickelson finally, dramatically shed the label of Best Player to Never Win a Major.  And, on the eve of the tournament, Tom Watson's long-time caddy (and perhaps golf's most famous caddy), Bruce Edwards, passed away after a battle with ALS.<br />Tomorrow, along with millions of other Americans, I'll look forward to John Feinstein's weekly call with Bob Edwards on NPR's Morning Edition.<br />&quot;Good morning, John.&quot;  &quot;Good morning, Bob.&quot;<br />&quot;Good bye, John.&quot;  &quot;Good bye, Bob.&quot;<br />In between those classic greetings, we'll hear Feinstein talk about Bruce Edwards and about Phil Mickelson.  These will be - hands down - *the* authoritative comments on both individuals.  Bob Edwards will ask just the right questions.  John Feinstein will deliver the best, most informed, concisely delivered answers.<br />All in three magical minutes.  [We'll leave it for another space to question why, why, why NPR's corporate suits decided something 'fresher' than this radio nirvana was needed.]<br />As usual, Feinstein's timing and touch are perfect.  The release of 'The Bruce Edwards Story' - obviously targeted for The Masters - has taken on added poignancy with his subject's passing.  This is Feinstein's third peek inside the PGA Tour's locker room, and it's a worthy successor to the first two books: &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; and &quot;The Majors.&quot;  [I'm not including last year's &quot;Inside the Ropes,&quot; which focused more on USGA officials than the players.]<br />Since the mid-eighties release of 'Season on the Brink,' John Feinstein has been America's best (and certainly most prolific) sportswriter.

The real stars of the book are the interviewers and editors who have done a wonderful job tracking down a diverse group of people, then coaxing the stories out of them.  You, the reader, are presented with what appears to be a monologue, but you can be sure that these texts are actually pieced-together answers from some very skillful questioning.<br />What really struck me was the juxtaposition between those people who would appear to have a lot going for them but have just been mailing it in vs. those people who have everything going against them, but see the glass not simply as half full, but overflowing.<br />An example of the latter:  Janice Lejeune - a merchandise handler.  Born deaf. Legally blind through a condition called Usher's Syndrome.  Recently divorced.  Kids grown and moved out.  And you think you've faced challenges?<br />On the surface, it would be very easy for this woman to give up and simply rue her fate.  Yet, she finds value and self-worth in work.  She sees herself as an example of what blind/deaf people can do.  It's about the most inspirational thing I've ever read.  I have chills recounting her story even as I write this.<br />'Gig' has that type of effect - I really didn't expect a book with such power.  These tales will stick with you.	2004-03-11

Think of Tom West - Kidder's protagonist in the groundbreaking 'Soul of a New Machine - times about 20 &amp; spread out over a lifetime, and you start to get a feel for Dr. Paul Farmer, 'the man who would heal the world.'  Kidder crosses paths with Farmer and is drawn into the world of the doctor's Haitian/Bostonian organization 'Partners in Health,' a.k.a. 'Zanmi Lasante' in Creole.<br />Kidder has done Farmer justice by painting a warts-and-all portrait.  He's not presented here as a saint, but instead as a complex being, not always easy to like, trying to all that come into contact with him (especially those that try to organize his personal life - travel, finances, etc.), but - in the end - a good soul who is a force (almost superhuman) for good in the world.<br />Kidder's work is strong when it focues on Farmer and his cohorts and their efforts along the &quot;Boston - Haiti axis.&quot;  Indeed, the contrast between the two environments makes for one of the most compelling aspects of the book.  I feel a little sheepish giving such a great work by Kidder anything less than 5 stars, but I really feel like the book loses focus and steam when it ventures outside of those two main locales.  [Kidder also travels with Farmer and/or fellow 'PIH-ers' to Paris, Russia (separate trips to Moscow and Siberia), and Peru.]<br />Above all, though, 'Mountains' is an important and forceful book about just how possible it is for one person to make a difference in the world.	2004-01-13

That was set as two three-hour pieces, playing on back-to-back weekends. The first weekend was the complete three-act 'Millenium Approaches'; the second was Kushner's follow-up, 'Perestroika.'<br />'Millenium Approaches' won a Pulitzer for Kushner, and it's easy to see why. It's an amazingly literate discourse and masterful interweaving of three strands of gay life in America as it stood before triple therapy arrived and slowed down the impact of AIDS.<br />By contrast, 'Perestroika' feels different and distant - lots of soliloquies, extreme anger, archsymbolism - I felt like the high point of the six-hour spread was the angel's dramatic appearance at the end of 'Millenium.'<br />Remembering back to the play, I think all the actors in Nichols adaptation really found new levels for each of their characters. For example, Pacino nailed Roy Cohn's perverse sense of logic: homosexuals (and you can hear the quotes around it when Pacino utters the word) have no power; I have power; I am not a homosexual; therefore, I do not have AIDS, I have liver cancer. I've read Cohn's biography and this is truly the way he saw things. Kushner has him nailed & Pacino really captures the essence of Kushner's words.<br />The other thing worth noting is that Mary-Louise Parker does wonders with the role of Harper Pitt. I remember thinking of the character as overwhelmed on stage (compared to the other actors), but, wow, does she stand out in Nichols' adaptation. It's the best performance in the film, in my eyes.	2004-01-06

The Humvee he and his military escort were traveling in lurched facedown into a dike.  I decided after hearing of this tragedy that I would honor his bravery by seeking out \\"Martyr's Day,\\" described by his colleagues as *the* master work of Gulf War reporting.<br />I was not disappointed.  This is fabulous writing...and reporting.  Reading 'War,' it comes as no surprise to know that Michael died in the middle of action.  The book is rife with passage after passage of Kelly routinely putting his safety in jeopardy to get a story.  Far from being a chonicle of simply Kuwait and Iraq, 'War' moves from Iraq to Jordan to Israel (via a complicated route through Cyprus - read the book to do this intricate travel itinerary justice) to Egypt to Saudi Arabia to a newly-liberated Kuwait.<br />The book stays strong throughout.  In fact, the two most powerful passages are towards the end: the first depicts - in shocking detail - the carnage on the so-called \\"Highway of Death\\" (the road back to Basra from Kuwait City); the second takes us deep into Kurdistan, where Kelly shows us what befalls those areas once the U.S. pulls its support for the post-Gulf War Kurd uprising.  Kelly follows the ramifications of Saddam's lash back at the Kurds through to a set of refugee camps on the Iranian border.  Kelly himself picks up and battles as nasty bout of dysentery from his treks through the camps and experiences first-hand how one could get so sick so quick.<br />The book ends with his personal tale of escape through a smuggler's route and into Turkey.  Other journalists traveling that same route are not so lucky: three that preceded Kelly are later found murdered.<br />In addition to the inherent splendidness of Michael Kelly's writing, the reason 'War' remains a compelling read 12 years after the fact is due to the numerous threads that tie these events to what transpired in Iraq in 2003.  For example, there are a couple of horrifying pages on Uday Hussein's thuggish domination of Baghdad nightlife in 1991.  Obviously, things would only get worse from there., there are a couple of horrifying pages on Uday Hussein's thuggish domination of Baghdad nightlife in 1991.

No book is ever going to do justice to seeing him perform live, but John Lahr has come close.  If you're a Dame Edna fan, you don't want to miss this book.<br />Beyond creating an indelible character, Humphries is a master improv comedian.  In November 2003, I saw 'Dame Edna' live at a Dallas, Texas appearance.  (S)he balanced five or six active storylines that were conjured up in conversations with various audience members.  How the evening went totally depended on what Edna pulled out of those people.  The results had the audience rolling in laughter and shocked at how much wonderful material could get mined out of what didn't appear to be much to work with.<br />If I had 10% of Barry Humphries talent, I would be very happy.	2003-12-02

But, I am an ardent Christopher Buckley fan.  I've read most of his books and find him to be unfailingly witty and insightful.  And, if you've ever seen him doing his schtick in person, you'd realize that he doesn't take himself that seriously.<br />So, if you scrutinize this book looking for evidence of partisanship, you're surely going to find it.  But consider the way Buckley presents it:  screaming across the room to get Dick Cheney's attention, he is self-aware enough to acknowledge that his behavior is a source of embarrassment to his children.  And as for those who might criticize his penchant for name-dropping, consider the following passage:<br />\\"For two years I had a White House pass that allowed me everywhere except, of course, the second-floor residence.  One time, hearing that Jimmy Cagney was about to get the Medal of Freedom in the East Room - where Abigail Adams hung her wash out to dry, where Lincoln's body lay in state, and where I once sat behind Dynasty star Joan Collins while she and husband number four (I think it was) spelunked in each other's mouths with their tongues while Andy Williams crooned 'Moon River' - I rushed over from the Old Executive Office Building just in time to see President Reagan pin it on the man who had tapped out 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' and was now a sad, crumpled, speechless figure in a wheelchair.  I remember Reagan putting his hand on Cagney's shoulder and saying how generous he had been 'many years ago to a young contract player on the Warner Brothers lot.'\\"<br />That's typical of the book and of Christopher Buckley's personal style.  Just the right combination of name-dropping, humor and reverence.  He's silly when can be, and respectful when he needs to be.  His 'Washington Schlepped Here' demonstrates a child-like enthusiasm for museums, an insatiable willingness to learn from Park Rangers and other tour guides, and a respectful reverence for George Washington and (especially) Abraham Lincoln.<br />And despite growing up in a family where Franklin Roosevelt was known only as 'that man,' he pays tribute to the enormity of FDR's achievements when visiting both the FDR Memorial and the Holocaust Museum.<br />For Christopher Buckley fans and newcomers alike, this book is a great read.pecially) Abraham Lincoln.<br />And despite growing up in a family where Franklin Roosevelt was known only as 'that man,' he pays tribute to the enormity of FDR's achievements when visiting both the FDR Memorial and the Holocaust Museum.<br />For Christopher Buckley fans and newcomers alike, this book is a great read.	2003-11-29

However, Malcom Gladwell dissected this phenomenon in great detail in his outstanding work, &quot;The Tipping Point.&quot;  Gladwell tells us that the Hub persona is actually comprised of three different indivduals: mavens, connectors and salesmen.  You don't really get down to that level of detail here.<br />Not to say Rosen's book is without merit.  I was fascinated by Gladwell's research and thought 'Buzz' would be a good complement to that.  With those expectations, I enjoyed the book and found it to be a worthwhile read.  I'll keep it on my bookshelf (for me, that's the litmus test of a book's worth).	2003-11-21

This part alone was a redeeming factor and made me feel that I got some value from my purchase.  These country-by-country write-ups are - for the most part - outstanding &amp; help place each country's recent history and vital statistics in appropriate context.<br />Here's an example:  I had to do some research on Ghana.  I pulled another book from my shelves as a starting point.  That one recited facts like the country's impressive 1998 economic growth (twice the African average), its eye-poppingly high female work participation rate (at 51%, only Cambodia's is higher), and its relatively low rate of registered unemployment.<br />Reading the NYT 2003 Almanac's review of Ghana, I got a totally different *and more realistic* picture.  Placing all these facts and figures in context, the Almanac revealed that:<br />- In 1998 the Ghanian economy had nowhere to go but up after 5+ years of brutal stagnation.  Plus, the World Bank got involved that year and put together a restructuring program that actually seemed to jump-start things.<br />- The situation got so bad in the 80s and 90s under Lt. Jerry Rawlings' rule that a fair percentage of the workforce fled to Nigeria to look for work (thus the high female particpation rates and low rate of 'official' unemployment).<br />So kudos to this Almanac for revealing the stories behind the figures.<br />Of course, this is not done without some irritation.  This same write-up on Ghana - in a 2003 guidebook, mind you - quotes major city population figures from 1988.  Similar books have 1998 figures.  Obviously, the differences between the two estimates are material.	2003-11-11

To give up is more terrible than death.&quot;	More than anything else I've read on the subject, Robin Kirk's &quot;More Terrible Than Death&quot; brings a degree of clarity and focus to the complicated, multi-layered hornet's nest of terrorism, endemic violence, drugs and corruption that are the scourge of the proud nation of Colombia.<br />It's interesting to note that in spite of documenting a wide range of horrific events, Kirk focuses on a glimmer of hope.  The book's title is perversely positive.  It comes from one of her Colombian human rights associates, who says to her (as she questions whether her efforts may be doing more harm than good) &quot;Don't doubt.

But I feel like he never connects with Blair during that time.  Either TB is holding back during this period or Stothard never gets the total access he touts.  Either way, Blair seems like he's simply part of the woodwork in the story.<br />But not that the book is totally without merit or interest.  Where it does excel is in depicting Blair's inner circle.  Stothard points out that Blair's governing model - to an upprecedented extent in British history - more resembles an American presidency than a typical Prime Ministry.  &quot;Unelected advisors&quot; dominate the space closest to Blair.  We're used to that here.  But in the UK, TB's total absorbtion of his role model Bill Clinton's approach to governing is seen as an alarming trend.<br />Dominating the scene is media advisor Alastair Campbell.  Perhaps that's because as an ex-journalist, he connects best with Stothard.  Or maybe it's because Campbell is undoubtedly Stothard's patron in this endeavour.  [Like Blair would suggest that a journalist tag along with him for 30 days?]  But, it's more than that.  Campbell dominates the book because Stothard has got it right.  Campbell is *the* dominating presence in Blair inner circle.  In the whole aftermath of the Iraqi conflict - the WMD debate, the row with the BBC, the suicide of Dr. Kelly - Campbell's fingerprints are everywhere.<br />He's a constant presence here on almost every page.  He has the best jokes (Blair asks him for help in drafting the start of a speech...Campbell suggests &quot;My fellow Americans...&quot;), is connected to the best information (all via text messaging it seems), sees around all the corners.  All while training for the London Marathon (which the 43-year-old finished in 3:53 shortly after the 30 Days were up...a great achievement considering all he was going through during training).<br />It's tough to imagine how the Prime Minister is going to survive without this guy by his side everyday.inister is going to survive without this guy by his side everyday.	2003-09-29

It's laden with references to a wide range of studies involving rats and nicotine, the dynamics of suicide epidemics, teen smoking, the 'Broken Windows' theory of crime, etc., etc.<br />That may sound like rather dry stuff, but trust me:  it's not.  It's a very compelling read, mostly because this is really a small business/start-up success guide in disguise.  Read Gladwell's excellent writing on things such as 'Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen.'  He's hit upon the key to bootstrapping a business.  He even throws in some advice like 'how to construct a Maven trap.'<br />Any small entrepreneur can benefit from these ideas.

The first is George Crile's masterful recounting of a buried episode in American history: how a relatively (and perhaps purposely) obscure Congressman from Lufkin, Texas got religion over the plight of Afghanistan's mujahideen getting pounded by Russian Hind helicopters. Almost singlehandedly, he pushes, prods, schemes, and connives a year-upon-year escalation funding a secret covert war directed by the CIA.<br />After the last Soviet commander crossed the bridge back into what was then the USSR, '60 Minutes' asked Pakistan's President Zia ul-Haq: how was all this possible?  Zia's simple reply:  &quot;Charlie did it.&quot;<br />It's an amazing story.  And for guy known as a producer (of '60 Minutes') not a writer, Crile has written the tale wonderfully.  He's captured the personalities, paid attention to the narrative, adhered to the timeline.  It's a delight to read.<br />And coming soon to a theater near you.  Tom Hanks' Playtone Pictures has acquired the rights to the book, and Hanks himself will play Wilson.  Look for it in 2004.<br />The other story deals with the law of unintended consequences, or what the CIA calls blowback.  When 9/11 happened, the roots were traced back to the void that developed in Afghanistan after the war was 'won'.  As Wilson himself says: &quot;we (messed) up the endgame.&quot;<br />And, as Crile notes at the conclusion of the book, the complete story of blowback hasn't ended yet.  Those Stinger missiles that play so prominently in the story have raised their head again.  Only this time, they're not aimed at the Hinds.	2003-09-02

When I read William Shawcross' \\"Murdoch\\" back when it was originally published (early 90s), I thought it was one of the best biographies I had read.  I especially liked the author's focus on his subject's \\"pre-News\\" days, most notably a very memorable discussion on Murdoch's infatuation with Marxism during his university days.<br />Murdoch explains that period away with the following answer:  \\"If you're 20 and not a communist, you have no heart; and if you're 40 and not a capitalist, you have no head.\\"<br />Shawcross then painstakingly builds a portrait of a man who - over the next 30 years - slides clear across the spectrum to become Maggie Thatcher's biggest champion.  There's a great blow-by-blow of Murdoch's battle with the press unions at Wapping, with Thatcher's tacit support.<br />Of course, things in Murdoch's world move quickly, so Shawcross put out an update edition (this one) in 1997.  Now, we need an update to the update.  So much has transpired in these six years.  We need Shawcross' take on:<br />- The continued rise of the Fox Network (expecially Fox News)<br />- Lachlan and James Murdoch's increasingly large roles at News Corp.<br />- The DirectTV takeover attempts (Part 1 and 2)<br />- Continued efforts to penetrate India and China<br />- Wife #3 Wendy Deng + two new young children<br />...and much, much more.

The successful ones have these seemingly serendipitous things happen to them - meeting the right investors, hiring the right employees, getting supportive beta customers, getting prominent play in the press.<br />Teresa Esser's point is that what often seems to happen by happenstance, isn't so random at all.  She believes that successful entrepreneurs have put into practice - knowingly or unknowingly - the &quot;ideal&quot; of what she calls &quot;The Venture Caf&eacute;.&quot;<br />One of Esser's subjects, Joost Bonsen (who runs informal networking events in Cambridge, MA), has the book's best take on what a Venture Caf&eacute; is:<br />&quot;It is a venue for adventurous thinking or a cauldron of creative ferment.  Who knows what will pop up from it?  In fact, nothing is likely to.  But you never know.  When it does happen, it does have powerful consequences.&quot;<br />Bonsen goes on to add that his role is to be &quot;a catalyst - some type of connection machine.  An engine of introduction.  A tangible mechanism by which two people who ought to connect do.&quot;  Esser spends the book driving to the heart of how best to capture and create the essence of what Bonsen describes.<br />Let other books tell you how to put together a business plan, how to sell your products, and other &quot;blocking and tackling&quot; elements of a start-up.

Pretty heady for a fairly esoteric business book published in April 1999.<br />The reason has to do with the latest (August 2003) edition of 'Fast Company' magazine.  The editors asked a series of business leaders to pick one \\"book that matters,\\" noting that \\"one book can change the direction of a company -- or a career.\\"  Bob Nardelli, ex-of GE and now CEO of the Home Depot, chose 'The Experience Economy.'<br />That's a great thing, because this excellent piece of work really got the short shrift - with its April 1999 publication date, its message of capturing the full potential of face-to-face retail got buried in the tsunami of e-commerce hysteria.<br />Now that we all recognize the Internet as just another viable sales channel, this fine effort by Pine and Gilmore has a second life.  The fact that Nardelli picked it as his one book that matters tells you all you need to know about his vision for the future of Home Depot.	2003-07-29

If you're a frequent reader of Vanity Fair or Men's Journal, a lot of this will look familar to you.<br />Furthermore, the book is arranged in chronological order.  From an editing perspective, that makes sense.  But it sells the author short.  Clearly, his style has evolved and matured throughout the years.  Without a doubt, the strongest pieces are at the very end - specifically, his two excellent essays about Afghanistan's \\"Lion of the Panjshir\\" Ahmad Shah Massoud.  Putting \\"Perfect Storm\\" aside, these pieces are Junger's defining work and the most compelling reasons to buy and read 'Fire.'<br />So my advice is to read the book backwards.  Go straight to \\"Lion in Winter\\" (2001) and \\"Massoud's Last Conquest\\" (2002).  Then, cherry-pick working backwards, remmebering that the better writing comes later.  In fact, Junger has been done a great disservice by his editors here by naming the book 'Fire' and leading with two extensive essays about forest fires in the American West.  This masks the fact the the best essays in the book involve Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Kosovo.	2003-07-07

He works a continuous three-sport cycle of topics amongst his growing body of work: golf, tennis, and basketball.  In my mind, nothing will ever top &quot;Season on the Brink,&quot; his seminal work on the mad genius of Bob Knight.  But, his golf work is great, too.<br />I had read Feistein's 'The Majors' before this...and while I do think it is the better read, 'Good Walk' is definitely worth your time.  Its publishers obviously think so as well.  Almost 10 years after its original publication, you can still find it prominently placed in most airports across the country.  If you like golf, its the perfect read for the plane.<br />The only reason I rank 'the Majors' higher is not due to the quality of the effort, but rather due to its relevancy.  Tiger Woods is still two years away from the PGA Tour as the events of 'Good Walk' unfold.  As a result, it feels like a quaint period piece.  Tom Kite battling Tom Watson, things like that.  Interesting, but nothing like what the tour is like these days.  In 'The Majors,' although Woods goes 0-for-4 in the 1998 events covered by Feinstein, his presence hangs over every page in the book (indeed, as 'The Majors' was being published in hardback, Woods begins his 'Tiger Slam').<br />Feinstein's writing style is so fluid.  It's enviable.  I love his little five-minute chats with Bob Edwards on NPR each Monday morning.  He writes just like he talks.  No small achievement.  We should all be so talented.  It's just the right mixture of inside info and folksiness.<br />Here's a good idea: Interweave some of Feinstein's books with the sports efforts from David Halberstam.  It's a great combination.  Each of them really knows how to profile sports stars.  I still marvel at Halberstam's 20+ page look at Bob Gibson in 'October 1964'.  That's the same type of care and diligence you get with Feinstein.  Great profiles in 'Good Walk' of a dozen or so golfers, most notably Greg Norman, Fred Couples and Davis Love.<br />The big surprise was Nick Faldo.  He's always been a favorite of mine, but famously close-lipped with the press. Not here.  I learned a lot about him that I didn't know.  Great job by Feinstein.

There was even a jingle about the debate:  \\"Who is better than his brother Joe?

His defensive wizardy covered for Williams' weaknesses in left field.<br />- Johnny Pesky...I grew up with Pesky as a Red Sox announcer; and, according to a legend handed down to me by my Dad (this happened all over New England) the man that \\"held the ball\\" while Enos Slaughter steamed around the bases in Game 7 of the 1946 World Series.  Halberstam - in the book's one piece of investigative journalism - debunks this tale.  there was a breakdown on the play, but it occurred elsewhere.  [Read the book for the details!]<br />- Bobby Doerr...this guy is a Saint in Boston, revered by all.  As Ted Williams' best friend, he bore the brunt of Teddy's temper throughout the years, but remained a steadfast friend.

It meanders aimlessly...characters materialize out of nowhere, but for no long-term effect...Vladimir Griskin's comeuppance seems scripted and abrupt, like Shteyngart was on serious deadline or something.<br />There's an entire middle section of the book - about 100 pages or so when Griskin is with Francesca and her family in New York - that could be completely excised with little or no effect on the overall story.<br />And, by the way, what's with the cover?  Is that supposed to be Morgan? (a character appearing only in the last third of book).  80%+ of the people who buy this book are going to assume that *this* is the Debutante in question.  Clearly, it's not.  Why the need to deceive?	2003-06-10

David Halberstam, America's finest non-fiction writer, painstakingly describes the unique atmosphere of the firehouse and the deep bonds that form between the men.  Above all, they strive - when the hour calls - to be, above all else, 'calm' and to 'do the right thing.'<br />On September 11th, these 12 men succeeded.<br />David Halberstam tells you how these men made a difference to the people in their lives.<br />If you don't know Halberstam's work that well, 'Firehouse' is a great intro for you.  Clocking in 500 pages *less* than some of his classic masterpieces, you can get a feel for the master's classic 10+ page in-depth potrayals that cut to the essence of somebody's character.  And you only need a couple of hours to tackle this short masterpiece.<br />Read it now and pass it on.  It's a great story to share.	2003-05-13

I bought &quot;Ripples from the Zambezi&quot; thinking, okay, person-centered development from an Italian who did government-sponsored work in Africa, perfected his methods in remote western Australia, and now spreads his gospel in the United States.  Ought to be an interesting read and a good 'little' story.<br />I was *way* off.<br />This is - in my estimation - a great book by a true visionary, Ernesto Sirolli.  The two chapters in the middle of this book &quot;The Esperance Experience&quot; and &quot;The Esperance Model Applied&quot; are as good as business-writing gets.  In Sirolli's world, the glass is neither half empty nor half full.  Rather, the water is gushing over the top of the cup.  The stories he tells here of enterprises 'facilitated' in the bleakest economic conditions imaginable...well, it can't help but turn you into an optimist.<br />But Sirolli goes further.  He takes these experiences and imagines them on a grand scale where, as he says, &quot;reciprocity matters.&quot;  Calling it a &quot;civic economy,&quot; he envisions a world benfiting from &quot;generalized reciprocity, from people helping people to succeed, with the understanding that well-being of the community is to everybody's advantage.&quot;<br />Don't misinterpret these sentiments.  Sirolli is a capitalist at heart, but he presses for a system &quot;beyind capitalism...which enhances participation in the creation of wealth, not only in its accumulation.&quot;<br />How does he connect the dots from tiny Esperance to his grand vision for a civic economy?  I urge you to read &quot;Ripples from the Zambezi&quot; to find out.	2003-05-10

This is a heartfelt critique from a man who truly loves his adopted homeland, but is seeing it...<br />...get steamrolled by bureaucrats...<br />...get covered over in concrete by insipid public works projects...<br />...fail to offer its citizens even token safety against industrial hazards...<br />...fall behind in education and entrepreneurism...<br />...respond ineptly to the wholesale implosion of their financial system...<br />...the list goes on.<br />The  Japanese Miracle?  Tell that to the people.  Two standout passages of many:<br />&quot;To be happy at home is the ulimate result of all ambition.  After decades of economic growth proving a per capita income many times their neighbors, the Japanese are not able to enjoy their own country.  They are not happy at home.&quot;<br />&quot;Most houses are completely uninsulated.  Discomfort - bone-chilling cold in winter and sweaty heat in summer - is a defining feature of Japanese life.&quot;<br />Wonderfully evocative stuff.  Alex Kerr is a great writer.<br />It is a devastating - and effective - critique.  All the more because Kerr's Japanese friends *implored* him to write the book.  To tell the story that they could not tell...for those who have &quot;very little voice (and) feel as sad and angry as I do.&quot;<br />And in case you think this is happening in a vacuum, here's Kerr's most dramatic point:  &quot;There is trouble, and it has happened once before in the past century when a similar process led the nation into disaster.  The same mechanisms that caused Japan to veer off course before WWII - a ruling elite guiding a system aimed single-mindedly at expansion - are at work today.&quot;<br />You'll find that important passage in the conclusion of the book.  I urge you to read Alex Kerr's excellent work to see how - step by step - he builds the case for this judgement.<br />One small nit: Kerr notes that &quot;all Japanese names are shown Japanese style: last name first.&quot;  Okay, this may be technically correct, but we've gone all of our lives knowing Seiji Ozawa, why reintroduce him to us know as Ozawa Seiji?  It seems a bit didactic.hown Japanese style: last name first.&quot;  Okay, this may be technically correct, but we've gone all of our lives knowing Seiji Ozawa, why reintroduce him to us know as Ozawa Seiji?

'Loose Balls,' Terry Pluto's history of the ABA, was listed in an eye-opening 13th place.  That intrigued me.<br />Well, the book is as good as advertised.  Pluto's master stroke is in his recognition that he was never going to be able to tell the ABA stories better that the people who participated first hand.  So Pluto simply collected the stories, arranged them, made some brief editorial remarks here and there, and really lets the guys tell the story themselves.<br />It's the perfect approach, because the ABA is all about the you-had-to-be-there stories.  There are many highlights, but two that stand out are the recounting of the many wild stories of Marvin Barnes with The Spirits of St. Louis (made more notable by the fact that Bob Costas was the Spirits 22-year-old rookie announcer & is an excellent source of ABA lore - in fact, he gets the book's last word), and the stories recounting the discovery of Julius Erving.  Like stumbling on to El Dorado.  I mean, it's spine-tingling, these guys telling you what it was like when they first saw Dr. J play.<br />I really urge you to buy this book.	2003-03-16

This book is harshly honest as they don't spare the rod in respect to either full-out industrial capitalists or eco-efficiency proponents.<br />However, I had three issues with this book:<br />1) It could have been a lot more throught-provoking if the authors had organized the book better.  Seriously, it takes 80 or so pages before you get a handle on the author's true point of view.  They spend every single word until that point debunking all other approaches in the field.  I wish they had interspersed it with their ideas.  But they keep their hand hidden until that point.  I found it frustrating.<br />2) There's a big deal made of the book itself, and its 'upcycle potential.'  All well and good, but can I point out a rather annoying side-effect?  This is a difficult book to read...I mean from an ergonomic perspective.  You just can't keep the thing open.  And as far as reading it on a bookholder when you're working out: forget it.  It will not lie flat.  I realize this is an insipid criticism, but this technology is not yet ready for prime-time, in my opinion.<br />3) The book needs to be more quantitative.  Only in the last chapter do we get any hint of realism, when the authors tell you about their work with Ford's River Rouge plant.  Up until that point, there were some hints dropped here and there, most notably about the Herman Miller office the duo built.  I'm sure they've got reams of quantitative evidence to support their theories.  For some reason, they made a decision not to present it, and I think it hurts the book.<br />Still, depsite these comments, I think 'Cradle to Cradle' is worth your time.	2003-03-10

Who better than to describe Warren Buffett than Buffett himself?  Editor Lawrence Cunningham expertly stiches together Buffett's wisdom and wit (he is genuinely funny) compiled from 20+ years of Berkshire Hathaway annual reports.  The triumph is that the result feels like a seamless, oral narrative with Buffett speaking to you one-on-one over hamburgers and Cherry Cokes.<br />My only problem with the book comes in the form of the rather interminable 24-page introduction penned by Mr. Cunningham.  Frankly, I barely made it to the starting line.  My advice to you, the prospective reader, is to graze the first *three pages* of the introduction, and then skip right to Buffett.  Pages four through 24 feature Mr. Cunningham telling you what Buffett is going to tell you.  The only redeeming aspect of this otherwise useless overhead is that it clearly demonstrates the power of Buffett's writing.  Cunningham completely succeeds in draining the text dry of Buffett's folksy, accessible style.<br />Just let Warren tell the story, please.	2003-02-27

Who wouldda thunk that a seemingly prosaic, esoteric topic like that would result in such a fascinating story?  Because this is not just a good business book, it's a flat-out great, spellbinding tale.  Even if you have zero interest in the car business, you'll devour this book in chunks of 80 to 100 pages a sitting.<br />The authors strong point is the richly drawn portraits they craft of the meger's main protagonists and the &quot;you are there&quot; blow-by-blow recounting of key events.<br />Dominating the book by force of oversized personality and leadership skills is Jurgen Schrempp, CEO of (at the start) Daimler Benz.  As the authors state &quot;Jurgen Schrempp knew no limits.&quot;  The book then launches into a fascinating, compelling 18+ page portrait of a complex, multi-facted man.  The book is co-written by Detroit News reporters Bill Vlassic and Bradley Stertz, but the writing is *seamless.*  Certainly, the portrait of Schrempp is the work of both writers, but it simply flows as a cohesive piece of beauty.<br />Another example:  &quot;The key to Schrempp's authority was not his rank.  It lay in his strategic mastery of people, extraordinary sense of timing, and instinct for the right move under the right circumstances.  His persona, intimidating one moment and charasmatic the next, only embellished the power of his arguments and strength of his leadership.&quot;<br />That's the essence of the guy.  Vlassic and Stertz have captured it magically.<br />Other standout portraits include -<br />&gt; Kirk Kerkorian - America's most compelling and quirky billionare is the surprise star of the first third of this book.  This was an added bonus for me - I thought I was going to read a car book, and I got 100+ fascinating pages on Kerkorian and his top-notch inner circle, including Alex Yemenidjian and, especially, a great portrait of Jerry York.  Reading this book made me understand for the first time what makes York so valuable to America's largest companies.<br />&gt; Bob Eaton, CEO of Chrysler - At best, this is the portrait of a guy completely overwhelmed, first by Kerkorian, then by Schrempp.  At worst, he teeters dangerously close to an emotional breakdown while negoatiating the future of 400,000 workers.<br />&gt; Bob Lutz, President of Chrysler - When Schrempp targets Chrysler, he does it because he envisions tapping into a swashbuckling crew of cutting edge carmakers.  In short, he envisions the essence of Bob Lutz (and, to a lesser extent, Dennis Pawley and Francois Castaing).  But the vindictive Eaton freezes Lutz out of any role in DaimlerChrysler, even though the trilingual, Zurich-bred product development master was a hand-in-glove fit for the new DCX board.  Today, Lutz is getting the last laugh, as he revs-up GM at DCX's expense.  Meanwhile, Eaton is out there somewhere, essentially shamed into obscurity.<br />One last note:  make sure you get the paperback.  Things go so disasterously wrong for DaimlerChrysler between the time of the hardback publication and the paperback release.  The authors capture that black, foul period perfectly in a 40-page epilogue to the paperback edition, including the impact of Schrempp's disasterous, infamous interview with the Financial Times, in which he admits he never had any intention of completing a merger of equals.  &quot;Me being a chess player, I normally don't talk about the second or third move.&quot;<br />As Vlassic and Stertz conclude, it was a &quot;precise and premeditated takeover&quot; all along.  A perfect ending to a truly fascinating book.valuable to America's largest companies.<br />&gt; Bob Eaton, CEO of Chrysler - At best, this is the portrait of a guy completely overwhelmed, first by Kerkorian, then by Schrempp.  At worst, he teeters dangerously close to an emotional breakdown while negoatiating the future of 400,000 workers.<br />&gt; Bob Lutz, President of Chrysler - When Schrempp targets Chrysler, he does it because he envisions tapping into a swashbuckling crew of cutting edge carmakers.

W. Bush's outstanding letter- and note-based memoir &quot;All the Best.&quot;  As much as I wanted to like it, I just couldn't trudge through the entire thing.  Mostly, it's the format that's at fault.  You get Bush's pieces &amp; Scowcroft's pieces interspersed with a 3rd-party disembodied voice attmepting to tie the segments together.  I can appreciate that Gen. Scowcroft was a major player and needs his own voice here.  But the resulting patchquilt of a book makes it tough on the reader to develop any semblance of continuity.<br />The other thing is that 'All the Best' introduced you to this charming, delightful, all-too-human side of our 41st President, the charasmatic guy who shows you - through his dedicated letter-writing and human touch - how to build and sustain life-long friendships.  I wanted that guy to star in this book.  Instead, the guy that wrote &quot;A World Transformed&quot; is a caricature of the tone-deaf (to the US Economy) internationalist we voted out of office in 1992.<br />A better route than &quot;A World Transformed&quot; would be to pair &quot;All the Best&quot; with David Halberstam's &quot;War in a Time of Peace.&quot;	2003-02-06

Linda Gorchels does a masterful job synthesizing all of the issues a product manager must be capable of tackling.  She accomplishes this task with clean, well-structured text and examples.  The heart of the book is really a series of extended checklists which are comprehensive, well-researched and accesible to the lay reader.<br />My only complaint is that the book is front-loaded with some some compartively less important stuff, including a chapter entitled &quot;Product Manager.com.&quot;  I suppose this emphasis is reflective of a book written in 1999 and published in 2000.  But as I cast my eye warily at that chapter I was *this close* to just chucking the whole thing.<br />Just then...bingo.  The red meat arrived at Chapter 5 when *finally* the planning skills required to be a PM were introduced.  The book from this point (p. 69 in hardcover) on is cram-packed with tremendous information that you'll use again and again.<br />So, my word of advice when you get this book is either (a) don't give up on it early, or (b) proceed directly to Chapter 5.	2003-02-01

Juan Enriquez' book - better than anything you'll ever read - frames the entire globalization debate in a clear, pragmatic, level-headed way.  He blitzes through a complete review of inter-country economics - from agri-society to the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age, now giving way to the force of Genomics.<br />Enriquez has a way of making startling points in a pithy, almost prose-like fashion.  [In fact, don't be put off by the Tom Peters-like spacing and font shifts.  Here, it works.  He brings heady and potentially esoteric subjects down to size in an inviting 'read me' fashion.]<br />Here's an example (and one of Enriquez' main points):<br />\\"Science and technology allow people to multiply their productivity much faster than those who do not have the same knowledge or instruments. ....<br />The text is spread out just like that in short, punchy, well-crafted sentences.<br />As you can tell from that passage, one of the book's main thrusts is Enriquez' comparison of countries that can or will meet the challenge, vs. those that don't or will not.  In one of the book's best sections, he compares South Korea (\\"the ulitmate meritocracy\\"), the USA (he makes the point that, increasingly, we rely on imported brain power) and Mexico (he recounts some shocking stories of Mexico's capacity to squander its intellectual capital).<br />Enriquez is well-positioned to make a S. Korea/US/Mexico comparison.  He's a true 'man of the world' - an HBS professor and former CEO of Mexico D.F.'s Urban Development Corporation.  He remains a harsh critic of Mexico's need to 'shape up' or be left behind at the station.  [In fact, he has an eye-opening, scalding commentary in the book of Ernesto Zedillo's tenure as Education Minister and President of Mexico.]<br />A good way to learn a little more about Enriquez and this book - before comitting to buy it - is to take a look at a recent piece wrtitten about him in Fortune (they call him \\"Mr. Gene\\").

This is a standard Halberstam technique.  Colin Powell, Madeline Albright, Wesley Clark, William Cohen, Les Aspin, John Shalihashvili, Tony Lake, Sandy Berger, Richard Holbrooke and a host of others all get the treatment here.<br />I'm not sure how the subtitle of the book was arived at, but I thought it was especially weak (the title itself is spot-on).  More appropriate subtitles - in order of appropriateness - would be along the lines of:<br />1. US Foreign Policy in Bosnia and Kosovo (plus a little Somalia & Haiti).<br />2. The Development of U.S. Foreign Policy 1992 - 2000.<br />3. Foreign Policy Development of the Clinton Administration (plus a little Bush (41) & a few generals).<br />Count me as one of the people who likes Halberstam's sports-oriented books (esp. 'Breaks of the Game' and 'October 64') better than his politics/affairs books, the exception being 'The Best and the Brightest' - required reading for every American.<br />Still though, I walked away feeling I had learned a lot about how the US 'develops' foreign policy.  A lot is being made right now of the hawk/dove divide that separates Rumsfeld and Powell.  Well, that level of divisiveness is not endemic solely to the Bush (43) administration.  The Clinton Adminsitration suffered a series of its own similar battles, culminating (in a bit of role reversal vs. the current protagonists) in Kosovo in which a hawkish Secretary of State (Albright) siezed and led the day over a dovish (and, in this case, ineffectual) Secretary of Defense (Cohen).<br />The brilliance of Halberstam's writing is to show you how the personalities intersect and interact, with policy slowly developing as a result of these ongoing personal dynamics.	2003-01-20

As evidenced by the accompanying 'Fast Company' article, Po no longer thinks of himself as the writer.  He nows sees himself as the central piece of the story.

(but overconfident, cocky, arrogant)<br />Nissan (then Datsun) / Japan - Bad (making cars on equivalence with cheap transitor radios)<br />-----<br />By mid-80s (the book was published in 86):<br />Ford (as proxy for US economic model) - Bad! (Hubris brings great fall, etc.)<br />Nissan (as proxy for Japanese economic model) - Good! (Height of Japanese bubble economy and 'The Japan that Can Say No')<br />-----<br />By mid-90s (Book starts to look very dated):<br />Ford - Ascendant! (tenures of Red Poling, Alex Trotman put Ford back on top)<br />Nissan - Collapsed! (popping of Japanese bubble economy; Nissan loses touch with consumers, bleeds red ink)<br />-----<br />2002 (Book regains its relevancy):<br />Ford (as proxy for US) - Punch-drunk fighter stumbling around taking an eight-count after brain-dead Jacque Nasser era<br />Nissan (as proxy for Japan) - Firing on all cylinders worldwide thanks to amazing leadership of Carlos Ghosn<br />-----<br />It is worth noting that contrary to Halberstam's premise, Nissan is succeeding *despite* the Japanese model, not because of it.  [Ghosn's real success has been his attack against long-held Japanese core principles such as guaranteed lifetime employment.]<br />What would be great would be a re-release of 'The Reckoning' with about a 75- to 100-page update by Halberstam bringing the events of the last 16 years into focus vis-a-vis the original premise of his 1986 publication.	2002-12-31

Yes, it was a chapter title in hardback version, but the real losers in Lewis's book are the so-called winners, Clinton and Dole.  By contrast, Lewis shows the strength of character of the putative losers, especially in compelling profiles of Morry Taylor, Alan Keyes, and even Pat Buchanan.<br />What I especially liked about the book was Lewis' fight not to get totally taken over by what seems to be his naturally skeptical and cycnical view of the world.  In fact, the best writing in the entire book deals with John McCain (Lewis is an unabashed McCain fan here, four years before that sentiment became in vogue) and - in particular - McCain's relationship with Clinton advisor David Ifshin.  This chapter is very far removed from a skeptic's view.  In fact, the emotion of the McCain/Ifshin relationship brought me to tears, as I think it would anyone.<br />Lewis is also affected by the stark honesty and un-political-ness of Morry Taylor, who is a real revelation here.  And despite being on an entirely different plane politically than Alan Keyes, Lewis never ceases to be amazed at Keyes' blindingly brilliant oratorical flights of fancy.<br />Here's another neat thing about the book (well, the hardcover version at least)...elliptical asides about Tabitha Soren (of MTV 'Choose or Lose' fame), a later reference to 'my houseguest at the time,' and an acknowledgement to the help of one 'Tabitha Sornberger' (Soren's real name).  She became Mrs. Michael Lewis not long after the publication of this book.my houseguest at the time,' and an acknowledgement to the help of one 'Tabitha Sornberger' (Soren's real name).  She became Mrs. Michael Lewis not long after the publication of this book.	2002-12-10

I was browsing in my local bookstore, saw \\"Secrets...\\" on the shelf, thought it looked interesting, forked over my [money].<br />Kanbar says friends, co-workers, etc. have consistently badgered him over the years to write a book.  I can see why.  This guy is an amazing source of creativity and perseverance.  Forget the \\"Inventors\\" title.  Anyone with even a smidgen of entrepreneurial zeal can benefit from the chock-a-block common sense crammed into this small volume.<br />The range of this guy's impact is stunning.  The innovations tumble forward, one chapter after another.  Kanbar says it all stems from a simple principle - see something you don't understand, and ask how and why it happened.  Then devise a solution that provides a real benefit and market it with a twist.<br />All the examples are compelling, but the SKYY Vodka tale - which Kanbar saves for the last chapter - brings everything together in a most impressive fashion.  He lays it our very succintly:<br />The problem?  He had headaches after drinking.<br />The reason?  After study, scientists tell him that the distillation process leaves impurities, called 'congeners.'<br />Solution?  A distillation process that eliminates the congeners.<br />The benefit? Drinking in moderation with less irratation.<br />The entire book reads just like that.  Great takeaway lessons for anyone.  Get this one on your bookshelf ASAP.	2002-12-02

Frankly, there are other books that cover the business of the Welch Style of Management better than Jack Welch (see, for instance, anything by Noel Tichy).  Welch's track record at GE - validated by the market via the company's rise in market valuation during his tenure- speaks for itself.<br />Two things that did stick in my mind from the book were his brief mention and dismissal of his first wife (he barely notes her existence up until the point where he - essentially - discards her) and his summation of his second wife, Jane: &quot;She has become the perfect partner.&quot;<br />As it turns out, I read this in the pre-Suzy Wetlaufer era.  And like many readers, I feel like I got Jack-ed, because 'perfect partner' Jane ends up getting the 'first wife treatment' as well.  And frankly, that 'perfect partner' line really sticks in my craw now.  I wonder: just how much more of 'Jack' is some misdirection woven by its author?<br />To get the real story on Welch and his relationships, you need to turn to sources like the Wall Street Journal.  Their excellent reporter James Bander broke the whole Harvard Business Review 'Jack on Jack' interview mess.  And the Journal's compelling story about the Welch domestic battle &quot;GE's Jack Welch Meets Match in Divorce Court&quot; (see Nov. 27, 2002 edition) makes for outstanding reading.	2002-11-30

Andy Grove's story of his first 20 years in Hungary and New York City tells us how the events of World War II and the Hungarian Revolution shaped the integrity and inner drive of one man.<br />The story is compelling in its own right.  But to read the story of Andras Grof and realize that this boy and his distant childhood turned into Andrew S. Grove...well, it's a journey of unfathomable proportions.<br />To his credit, Grove never oversells the story.  He is quite forthright about his role in the Revolution - he was simply a bystander.  Fellow Hungarians have read his story and lauded him for his accuracy and honesty.<br />Grove's writing style is sparse and direct.  He recalls events with clarity and without extensive interpretation.  He gives credit to a couple of editors who helped shape the story, most notably Norman Pearlstine of Time.  But this is no ghost-written CEO treatise.  These are obviously his words.<br />Some will read &quot;Swimming Across&quot; and conclude that it is a statement about the triumph of the American system.  Grove notes near the end of the book &quot;I've continued to be amazed by the fact that as I progressed through school and my career, no one has ever resented my success on account of my being an immigrant.&quot;<br />While there's an element of that, I think you'll see it more as a simple but brilliant testament to the Power of One Man.<br />Long live Andy Grove.	2002-11-27

Brzezinski even pays tribute to Freeland's talents in his book.<br />Granted, there is a hard-earned interview with the 'wily' Anatoly Chubais, but short of brief episodes like that, this is really the story of Brzezinski himself and his fiancee (now wife) Roberta as they navigate along the shoals of the East's first brush with capitalism.  So it's not really &quot;WSJ reporter Brzezinski demonstrates his knowledge of Russian bond yield curves...&quot; but rather &quot;Hey, here's what was going on in my personal life while I was writing those stories.&quot;<br />And for me, that's a fresh take, and here's where his editors and marketers have sold him short: only about 25% of the book takes place in Moscow.  The author also takes you to Vladivostok, Sakhalin, St. Petersburg, Chernobyl, Minsk, Crimea, and Poland - and that's not a complete list.  In fact, I thought the writings from Vladivostok were the book's finest passages, closely followed by Chernobyl.<br />I think readers will be pleasantly surprised by the accessibility of this book.  It is worth noting that Brzezinski's work is available in paperback, while Freeland's effort - despite being the definitive account of the period - is now out of print (hardback only) despite its contemporaneous publication date.	2002-11-20

For me, &quot;Hoover's Vision&quot; is that book.  Gary has this incredibly wide perspective on the world: he takes in everything; it all seems unrelated; he synthesizes the components into a whole; draws out the important lessons, ideas and trends; and then translates those ideas into a winning business model.<br />&quot;Hoover Vision&quot; lays out that process in detail.  It seems like alchemy.  His point: it's not.  You need to discover what's out there, develop your unique perspective on the world, embody that perspective into your business idea, and then sell that vision to the world.<br />It's a beautiful thing.	2002-11-15

Chechnya was, in Fred Cuny's words, the \\"scariest place I've ever seen.\\"  [Read about this guy's incredible life and you'll understand the magnitude of that statement.]<br />The book is filled with many tales of the desperation, fighting power, guile and pluck of the Chechnyan people.  In short, it's no surprise to me (and certainly not to Scott Anderson, I bet) that despite Vladimir Putin's assiduous efforts, the terror has made its way to Moscow.<br />If you think one life can't make a difference, then you don't know about Fred Cuny.  What he did in Sarajevo during the Bosian conflict will blow your mind.	2002-10-29

It's brilliant stuff, written in clear, concise terms.  And, surprisingly, very little of it is dated.  Unlike many books from that era, there's no .com or Enron fixation for the author to be embarrassed about.  Schrage's examples are pulled from health care technology, animation, theater...in short, an eye-opening spectrum of ideas.

But that fact didn't cause me to love \\"Road Fever\\" any less then they did.  What I loved about it is the care Tim Cahill spent in recounting in great detail the amount of preparation - especially in the area of paperwork - required to make a journey from Tierra del Fuego to the northern tip of Alaska in record time.<br />Because, frankly, it's not a question of how fast you can drive; rather, the BIG ISSUE is how much time it takes you to cross the border from Country X to Country Y.  And then again from Country Y to Country Z.  This ain't the European Community where you can whiz past the Germany - Netherlands border without realizing it.  These are real border crossings - guards, official stamps, commissars, corruption, danger, you name it.<br />Garry Sowerby and Tim Cahill spent up to a year preparing for that aspect of the trip.  Yes, GM sponsorship helped in places.  Yes, the Canadian government helped in places.  But what carries them through at the end of the day is the intense focus and planning these two guys put into the journey before the trip even gets started.<br />There's a lesson in there for everyone.	2002-07-05

Why is it that these are very often the most enjoyable and satifying reading experiences?  This slim 144-page, novella-like volume taught me so much about Angola, it's Portugese colonial heritage, the factional fighting that developed in the 60s &amp; came to a head during Kapuscinski's three-month stay in the country in 1975, and the eye-opening level of involvement of such players as Cuba and South Africa.<br />The amazing thing is *how little* things have changed since 1975.  Since the fall of Portugal's dictatorship, there has been constant battle for almost 30 years.  Jonas Savimbi - introduced here as a very young freedom fighter - was killed in battle only a short time ago.<br />Added bonus:  There's a wonderfully sparse little map of the country &amp; the borders of its neighbors at the front of the book.  You'll thumb back to that page no less than 50 times while reading &quot;Another Day of Life.&quot;<br />The title is apropos..when one of the characters utters the it two-thirds of the way into the book, I thought it was the perfect line at the perfect time.  No wonder they culled it out of the book and had it serve as the title as well.<br />I plan on reading the rest of Kapuscinski's works now.	2002-06-17

As a huge Nick Hornby fan, I was enthralled with the final product of the filmmakers.  No \\"let's move the script to Chicago\\" debasing of the script, a la the Cusack-centric version of \\"High Fidelity.\\"  As good as the book is, \\"About a Boy\\" the movie is even better.  It didn't seem possible.<br />But even if you've seen the movie, and are thinking about the book, I suggest you give it a try.  Especially if you've never read Hornby before.  In fact, if you're 'new to Nick,' here's one man's take on a course of action...<br />1. [Assumes you've just seen 'About a Boy.']<br />2. Read the book.<br />3. Rent 'Fever Pitch' from Blockbuster.  [The book is rather a tough read - unless you're a European football (aka 'soccer') fanatic.  It deals with Hornby's lifelong obsession with Arsenal & his struggles to become a writer.  But the movie is a sweet little vignette drawn from the book.  It makes for a nice viewing by a couple looking for a good Staurday night rental.  Just ignore the odd cover box, which has nothing to do with the movie.]<br />4. Read 'High Fidelity.'  [Only see the movie if you've read the book first.  Don't let the movie ruin the book for you.]<br />5. Read 'How to Be Good.'<br />---------<br />Here are two neat little differences between 'About a Boy,' the movie and book, that I don't think will ruin the book for you:<br />'Social Suicide' Song<br />---------------------<br />Movie:  'Killing Me Softly'<br />Book:  'Both Sides Now'<br />An inspired choice by the moviemakers.  The only downside being that you'll feel like an idiot when you get caught by your co-workers singing 'Killing Me Softly' later in the week.<br />Marcus' Musical Awakening<br />-------------------------<br />Movie: Mystikal<br />Book:  Nirvana<br />The scriptwriter really demonstrated a good pop-culture relevancy touch here with this change.	2002-05-21

Things like &quot;To abrigo es distinto...&quot;<br />A second important item of note to potential purchasers is that the book assumes you have THE ENTIRE VERB SYSTEM down cold.  Each of the 41 sections of the book has 'standard' and 'advanced' sections of vocabulary.  But Word 1 in the standard list could fire off an example that features a sentence that combines conditional and subjunctive imperfect tenses.  After all, it's a vocabulary - and not grammar - book.  But just make sure you know that going in.<br />Third point - I can't figure out what make a word or expression worthy of 'advanced' vs. 'standard.'  I'm just opening up to a random page (p. 338) as I write this review, and I see the words 'apenas,' 'mayor,' and 'menor' in the advanced section, while 'de ninguna manera' sits in the standard.  Odd, huh?<br />Despite all these objections, this book is really a good edition to your library.  Its triumph is the groupings of the words and phrases into 41 loosely defined categories.  Despite what I think are three valid criticisms here, reading and re-reading this book is an effective way to increase your vocabulary.  Which, after all, is its primary goal.	2002-05-20

So the story is fascinating; the subject complex; the writing precise and intricate.  I found myself reading and re-reading entire sections of the book, just to make sure I really understood the implications of what Bowden was reporting.  It's not that it was hard to understand or follow.  Rather, it's that the events he reports are so dramatic, tense, and eye-popping, you often want to go back and read the details again.<br />One example:  in the paperback book, there's a brilliant passage on p. 194. It took me three to four readings to catch all the intracacies of Bowden's summation of the relationship circa April 1993 between Search Bloc, Los Pepes, Centra Spike, Delta Force and the CIA.

Yeech.  I couldn't stomach more than 10 pages or so.  In the future, let's keep the writing to others writing *about* Mr. Hock.  This book reads like someone who's been cooped up in the study a bit too long.  In the original article, there was an exciting thesis about creating organizations in which power was pushed away from the center.  And Visa, Hock's brainchild, was a brilliant manifestation of that principle.<br />But the book is about...ummmm, what?  &quot;Old Monkey Mind&quot; musings?  Who can follow these meanderings?  Readers of the article are bound to be disappointed.  At least we get a little insight as to why the author is no longer at Visa.

It's an interesting start, but the book is much more than that.  It's the personal reporting that sets the book apart.  It becomes Martinez' travelogue - he befriends families in Cheran, Mexico, then meets up with them again in the United States in such far-flung places as Warren Arkansas, Norwalk Wisconsin, and Watsonville California.  The initimacy of the reporting sticks with you long after you've completed the book.  One standout passage of note: a tour of a meat-processing plant in Wisconsin.  Paging Sinclair Lewis.<br />Don't wait for the paperback.  For this book, only the hardcover will do because you'll want it on your bookshelves for many years to come.	2002-03-26

Pick up this collection of letters from President Bush (version 41) and you'll be amazed - this prolific letter writer put himself at the nexus of many of this past half-century's great events through a diligent practice of correspondence with friends, leaders, benefactors and the general public.  And you get the impression that he never considered it a chore.<br />There are important lessons to be learned here.  Gene Siskel was quoted once as saying \\"Everything I got in life happened because I wrote a letter.\\"  This book is a living manifesto of that principle.<br />This book is worth every penny.  At 600+ pages, it still seems too short.  People used to carp at GHWB that he didn't have \\"the vision thing.\\"  But you'll see his vision clearly articulated in these letters.

But I'm here to tell you that this work by Alfredo Gonzalez Hermoso is *even better.*<br />First of all, I like the layout of the verb tables.  Unlike Kendris' work, Gonzalez Hermoso groups his 'model verb' tables into &quot;ar&quot; &quot;er&quot; and &quot;ir&quot; sections.  This approach is far more helpful than you think.  Second, the irregular aspects of a particular model are clarified on each page with bold, red print.  This little feature makes it really easy to spend 15 minutes or so each day flipping through the book and picking up one or two of those extra little quirks that makes the verb system so maddening at times.<br />Then, there's the 'regional usage' section, which details how the usage of certain verbs varies across the Hispanic world.  Like, don't use 'coger' - which ostensibly means 'to catch' - in Mexico, okay?<br />I carry this book + &quot;Buscalo!&quot; (Clarkson, Campos) around with me at all times and try to review a couple of pages each day.	2001-12-21

Probably comes in at the intermediate level &amp; above.  Assumes you know the complete verb system...the stories throw pretty much everything at you in terms of sentence construction.  The more advanced you are, the less you need to depend on the English translation and just read the stories in Spanish, which even by themselves are treasures (I. Allende, G. Garcia Marquez, C. Fuentes among the estimable authors included).<br />The translations are a joy to read, because you notice right away that there's not this word-for-word transliteration that you get with many attempts at parallel texts.  The translators (each credited in their own right) really try to bring across in English the feeling and emotion that the writer intended when they penned the original Spanish.  It's eye-opening.  On top of that, the book's editor John R. King has added about 20 - 30 or so footnotes per story that really take your understanding to a new level.  A great example:  in the first story, he adds a footnote to denote when the two characters in the story slip from using formal verb construction into informal.  It would have slid right by me, had it not been for the footnote.  And it does mark a definite change in the direction of the story.<br />Really good stuff.	2001-12-19

And Arenas' book feels like a completely different experience than Julian Schnaebel's equally fine film.  The film takes some of the most colorful episodes of the book - however brief they may be (some worth no more than one paragraph of Arenas' time) - and stitches them together to form a pastiche of Arenas' life.<br />The book is even more powerful because of its intense and lengthy passages detailing Arenas' *very* humble beginnings, his struggles to evade capture by the secret police, and his physically and mentally debilitating lengthy stay in just about the most vile prison setting you could ever imagine.<br />There's an obvious urgency in this book.  Arenas is dying of AIDS at the time, and the book is the result of a lot of sessions of him speaking his recollections into a tape recorder.  And the book, even in this English translation, maintains that informal, conversational, &quot;pull closer, friend&quot; type of feel.<br />Another noted difference between screen and paper versions: while the movie certainly does not hide Arenas' lifestyle choices and his noted promiscuity, the book is on a different level entirely.  He leaves no stone unturned in describing a no-holds-barred personal sexual history replete with lovers, animals, cousins, friends, enemies, prisoners, transvestites, government officials, informants, army recruits, teenage ruffians, hired help, etc.  It's jaw-dropping.  Arenas lived life with the same urgency that comes through in his writing.	2001-08-22

The guy has an amazing talent to take a mundane incident (like an interview with MTV for a possible \\"Real World\\" role) and examine it every which way to Sunday.  Before you know it, he's taken 30+ pages to describe what is probably an hour-long event.  I think he's in on the joke, folks.  He knows it's mundane; he knows it's weird to spend 30 pages talking about it.  But he's going to do it anyway.  And, frankly, the deeper he gets, the funnier it is.  For example, the scene where he meets Puck (of \\"Real World SF\\" fame), is flat-out hilarious.<br /><br />Which brings up a point I want to make, one that I think is underserved in these reviews: if you're living in the SF Bay Area, or if you've recently vacated the premises, you owe it to yourself to read AHWOSG.  Eggers eye and ear for San Francisco in the mid-90s is amazing.  His late-in-the-book rant about why he's fed up with the city and is looking to leave is pitch perfect.  It crystallizes the thoughts of a lot of people here.  He's got a really good take on Berkeley's unique characteristics as well.<br /><br />Don't take the title seriously and you'll have a great time with this one.	2001-07-23

Zadie Smith obviously has great writing chops.<br />However, something odd occurred in the editing process.  Ummm, namely, the process just didn't happen.  The book has the feel of something that passed directly from Zadie's word processor to my hands.  There are entire chunks of the book, especially in the last 150 pages, that are developed and just never amount to a hill of beans.  An animal-rights protest group thingie (can't think of what else to call it) is particularly maddening.  You could literally excise the whole piece - probably 40 - 50 pages worth of fluff - and the book would read exactly the same.<br />White Teeth is at its best when it focuses on its core characters of Archie Jones and Samed Iqbal.  Around half-way through, Ms. Smith appears to get bored with those two.  Unfortunately for her readers, the novel loses its focus as soon as Samed and Archie fade to the background.  For the last 200 pages, they are presented as mere afterthoughts.<br />To the author's credit, the book is notable for its very impressive range of scholarship on geographies as varied as Jamaica, Bangladesh, North London, and Bulgaria; in addition, topics like Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, genetics, World War II and teenage angst are covered with uncommon skill.  This is no hack writer.  So despite my criticisms here, I look forward to Zadie Smith's next effort.	2001-07-23

If you're a golfer and you don't know this guy's stuff, you're missing out on what is week-in, week-out THE most irreverant and clued-in set of insights into golf.  So based on the strength of his weekly work, I bought &quot;Bud, Sweat, and Tees.&quot;<br />Besides the odd title (which I'll bet was foisted upon an unwilling author), this is really a great book.  It's about one bi-coastal plane trip in length, and it's a perfect way to pass the time.  Shipnuck really struck gold with Beem and Duplantis.  I imagined him trying to write a book like this about some of your run-of-the-mill, blow-dried tour pro.  It just wouldn't work.  You'd get 15 - 20 pages of material at best.  Yes, both of these guys are squandering what looked to be pretty bright futures, but as Mark O'Meara tells a despondent Breem late in the book (paraphrased) &quot;Rich, you've already done something that most golfers only dream about.&quot;<br />As for Steve Duplantis, you've got to read the book to even begin to believe this guy's life.  I won't attempt to do it justice here.  Man, talk about red meat to an author.<br />Two odd editing mistakes in the book were unsettling to me, though.  First, on page 100 there is talk about Beem's spin around the course of Waialea for the Hawaiian Open.  In all other places in the book, it's (correctly) Waialae.  The Hawaiian alphabet being what it is, this is more than a letter transposition: these are two actual places (and courses).<br />The second error is more egregious.  On page 217-218, in the middle of a gripping, shot-by-shot recounting of Breem's charge at the 1999 Texas Open, Shipnuck describes a &quot;momentum-halting bogey&quot; and notes that &quot;Breem was now -16, in fourteenth place...&quot;  I must have read that line ten times, trying to figure out what I had missed, given that Breem was in 2nd before dropping the shot.  Of course, it's a misprint and it should say Breem had dropped to *fourth* place. I'll call that a momentum-halting editing mistake.<br />One inside joke that Shipnuck drops on his regular readers really had me chuckling:  while covering the Pebble Beach Pro Am, he mentions the nearby town of Salinas, CA &quot; the dusty farming town that birthed John Steinbeck, among other writers.&quot;  Yeah, like Alan Shipnuck.ed to *fourth* place.

Then it's...huh?  What happened?  He fritters away 30 - 40 pages detailing the character of Sareth's doctor brother Gamini.  An interesting portrait, yes, but in the end it adds absolutely zero to the plot he mapped out in the first 200 pages or so.<br />By the time his Gamini fixation peters out, he's got 30 pages or so to tie up the whole mystery (of what you can remember).  The revelation of Sailor's identity becomes almost an afterthought, a chapter on the President of Sri Lanka appears about 200 pages late, Sareth goes swings from cipher to villain to hero in the space of about 10 pages that read like &quot;damn, I gotta finish this thing.&quot;  Meanwhile, where's Anil?<br />Hopefully, someone can fix this well-meaning mess in the movie version, much like Tony Minghella did with &quot;The English Patient.&quot;	2001-05-19

There are three moods, 14 separate conjungation sets for each verb, maddening irregularities.  Confronting this obstacle stymies many students, and they end up forever talking in the present tense.<br />In the context of that background, you realize what a triumph Dorothy Devney's book is. She systematically works her way across the entire verb complex, explaining each concept in clear, consise text with crisp examples and appropriately constructed exercises.  Each chapter builds on the next one.  Before you know it, you've covered everything.  Not that you're going to be fluent coming out of this book.  That's going to take practice, practice, practice.<br />But if you're like me, the revelation that this book offers is that the verb system is indeed finite...you get to see that there is an end to it...you can understand the way the entire system works...you can read stories and identify the tense and mood of each verb and know why it was written that way.  In short, it's the best way out there to boost your confidence and speed your path towards mastery of the langauage.	2001-02-25

But unfortunately, that is the case.  If you're a real Shackleton fan, you'll want to read this book only as background after taking on works by Caroline Alexander or Alfred Lansing.<br />In comparison, 'South' has the following shortcomings:<br />1. The writing style is impenetrable &amp; stilted.  It has not aged well in the 80+ years since it was put down on paper.<br />2. The misuse of Frank Hurley's photographs is annoying - they're out-of-focus, oddly chosen and misplaced in sequence in the book.  See Alexander's book for a revelation of the power and majesty of Hurley's work.<br />3.  You only get Shackleton's point of view here.  Lansing and Alexander pull together the journals of many particpants and you get a real flavor of the men that comprise the crew.

If the publisher wanted to make browsers think twice about a purchase, they've done it.<br />But despite the cheesy cover, I went ahead with my purchase &amp; was not disappointed.  One would think that just about every aspect of the Beatles has been absolutely covered and trampled to death.  Then along comes Debbie Geller with this gem - the Brian Epstein angle has been an untapped vein up until this point.  It's not so much a traditional book about her subject as it is an oral history.  Geller's coup is to get Paul McCartney - among many other voices - to comment at length on Epstein's role with the group.<br />The book's main themes and premises, of which a strong case is made by all the book's participants:<br />1. There would be no Beatles without Epstein.  During the very early sixties when they were no more than a crude band distinguished only by their Hamburg experience, Epstein's belief in 'his boys' was indefatigable.  He created a new image for them, and sold that image - after much rejection - to London.<br />2. Epstein created rock and roll management and promotion as we know it today; it simply did not exist before he came along, &amp; it is around today mainly in the guise that he created.<br />3. Epstein was a terribly complex and conflicted man.  No one participating in this project makes the case that he was 'nice' or easy to get along with.  In fact, he comes across as a holy terror at times.  Jewish in a non-Jewish world, openly gay prior to any societal openness on that front, a manic-depressive (some posit) before a clinical diagnosis for such an afflication existed, addicted to various uppers and downers.<br />This was a terribly complex, troubled - but enormously gifted - man.  To think that he fit all he did into 32 short years.  Amazing.<br />Thank you Debbie Geller for honoring this blazing comet named Brian Espstein, who willed the Beatles into this world.is world.	2001-01-15

I'm a big fan of Blue Man Group, and they quote a &quot;Mark Levy&quot; in their promotional material. That book - &quot;Technicians of Ecstasy : Shamanism and the Modern Artist&quot; (1993) - is quite probably written by a different Mark Levy.<br />But amazon's search engine popped 'Accidental Genius' to the top of the list.  I was intrigued, especially due to the more-frenetic-than-usual ravings of Tom Peters.  I bought it, and was not disappointed.  I suffer from many of the problems Levy describes.  Foremost, these seemingly great ideas in my head tend to get self-edited and written in an odd, foreign voice by the time they make it down onto paper.<br />Levy's 'private writing' technique is a usuable, practible method that can be employed straightaway.  Its power is to allow your voice on paper become the same as the voice you have in your head.  It's disarmingly simple, but powerful stuff.<br />Chockful of examples and exercises, you can start using Levy's techniques for immediate results.	2001-01-06

It's just that...this is the finest fiction I've ever encountered and I thought only my best words and thoughts would do it justice.  With 2001 underway, I've decided that day is not coming soon - time to do it.<br />I could go on all day about the beauty and intensity of this tale, but I'll restrict my commentary to the three following items:<br />1. You must give this book 50 pages to settle in.  The first 50 will feel like tough slogging.  The book does not find its paces until the Italian troops start marching their way to Athens.  Then, you're off and running.<br />2. I urge you to read the book before the movie comes out.  Form your own visions of Corelli and Pelagia before having to deal with the images selected by the filmmakers.  I won't reveal those names here (you can find them elsewhere if you like), but will only say that the choice for Pelagia is inspired; the choice for Corelli...well, I'm skeptical it'll work.<br />3.

First off, if your objective is to learn more about Italy and Sicily in particular, go immediately to Robb's work. He spends about four to five pages dissecting 'The Leopard.'  If that whets your appetite for more, then come back and buy di Lampedusa's book.<br />For me, I'm sorry to say that Robb's summary is about all that was needed.  There are certainly no more than four to five pages worth of events of note in 'The Leopard.'  After reading 'Midnight in Sicily,' the only thing of interest here are the oblique references to the beginnings of the Mafia - the sudden rise in Don Calogero's wealth and political standing despite his noted 'uncouthness' &amp; the reference to another minor character (Vicenzino) as a &quot;man of honor&quot; interpreted by di Lampedusa as 'one of those violent cretins capable of any havoc.'<br />Putting this book in historical context, these sentiments surely must have shocked Italy with their boldness when it was originally published in 1958.  So my hat is off to the author for that.  And certainly for those interested in the history of Italy in the 1860s, this book puts flesh on the various social sets that existed in that time.  But as a follow-up to 'Midnight in Sicily' - with that book's vivid, up-to-date accounts of the Sicilian Mafia (just one of many praiseworthy aspects) - 'The Leopard' is a disappointment.	2000-12-16

By contrast, the poor reproductions appearing in Lansing's work are notable only by their odd selection.  The small set does no justice to the tale at all.  To think that the full impact of these photos was not revealed until the '90s in the form of Alexander's book and contemporaneous exhibits!!<br />Lansing's book also perpetuates one of the big lies of Hurley's work:  for some reason, the famous picture of the Elephant Island crew waving at a boat in the distance is termed as &quot;The Rescue:  Help comes at last.&quot;  Instead - as Alexander clears up - this picture depicts the James Caird *leaving* the island on its start of the epic journey to South Georgia.<br />Through the photos, Alexander's book gives you a better feel for the distinct personalities that make up the crew of the Endurance.  But to give credit to Lansing, his effort certainly does a much finer job at detailing the deprivations and tribulations faced by the crew and throughout his tale, death seems a more probable outcome (and realistically so).<br />Lansing seems to lose steam at the end:  the trek across South Georgia and the trip back to Elephant Island is wrapped up in 20 pages, when it could easily make up an entire book.  Then it's left to the publisher to add a couple of comments about some significant events after the journey is wrapped up.<br />Good thing Alexander's work exists to feed the answers to the obvious question: how did life play out for these amazing inividuals?	2000-12-03

One highlight:  I almost drove off the road listening to the accounts of Sedaris' French class with his sadistic teacher telling him - in English &quot;I hate you.  I hate every day with you.  Each day with you is like giving birth by cesarean section.&quot;<br />Now I don't know what that read like in the book, but I'm here to make a pitch for the audio casette version.  Sedaris' voice, understated delivery, and hilarious imitations make the extra investment you'll need to purchase the tapes worth every cent.  I'm sure 'Giants Dreams, Midget Abilities' is a hilarous read, but hearing him imitate his instructor, Mr. Mancini, will put your enjoyment of the tale on a whole different level.  And there's Sedaris' Billy Holiday imation in the same tale...frankly, I had to compose myself to finish this review because I'm chuckling so hard remembering all this great stuff.<br />Buy the tapes.	2000-11-24

There's a thin thread throughout about the way Lumet conducts his movie project, most evident in the book's best chapter (7) entitled &quot;Shooting the Movie:  At Last!&quot;  The pieces of the puzzle all fall together at that point, and you get a true sense of everyone's responsibilities and how Lumet plans and uses these resources.  So yeah, that's project management.<br />But if you're going to buy this book, buy it because you're interested in how movies get made, starting right from how a script is chosen, through to the preview.  From that perspective, it's a great book.  Again, in the book's best chapter, you get a sense for just how draining - and unglamourous - it is to actually shoot the movie.  Early pick-ups, lots of work with stand-ins to get the set (esp. lighting) right, multiple takes, late-night viewing of rushes.  This is tough work, and Lumet describes it clear, concise language.  And he pulls no punches as to where his frustrations lay in the process.<br />Roger Ebert's cover blurb states &quot;I am sometimes asked if there is one book a filmgoer could read to learn more about how movies are made and what to look for while watching them.  This is the book.&quot;  I'd say that's a very accurate summation of what you'll find here.	2000-11-17

Unlike earlier reviewers, I'm still partial to his fiction, and of the two books he's put out there, &quot;Bombardiers&quot; (vs. &quot;The First $20 Million...&quot;) is by far the better work.<br />Yes, it's funny, it's biting, it has that &quot;Catch 22&quot; thing going on...but it's also *very* educational.  Bronson really understands markets and does a great job here getting their complexities down on paper in an engaging, even riveting, way - even when it involves something as trivial as the office breakfast.<br />Very humorous and very highly recommended.	2000-11-14

Enormous successes, yes...but to such a degree that it seems on a scale of Everest proportions. In contrast, the magic of John McCormack's story is that success seems so approachable after reading his 'plain talk for plain people.'<br />Folks, this guy is the real deal.  Along with his wife Maryanne, this Texas legend has totally transformed the seemingly prosaic field of hairstyling into a cauldron of entrepreneurship.  The best part of the book is witnessing the impact that his business, Visible Changes, has made on his employees.  In many parts of the country, hairstyling is a dead-end job for washouts from the educational system.  McCormack has totally turned conventional wisdom on its head and shown just how powerful that workforce can be when they are treated with respect.<br />And the personal saga of John McCormack himself is a real page-turner to boot.  For that reason alone - in addition to the simple lessons he passes along - these are 220 pages that you won't soon forget.	2000-11-14

It's absolutely a great way to pass a two- to three-hour plane ride. Burroughs does a wonderful job describing life at a Home Shopping Network-type organization.  His bits spoofing the various products &amp; the pitches that go along with them are witty and very lively.<br />But anyone looking for real character development here is going to be disappointed.  A couple of folks get fully formed, others seem to pop in and out of the story with little meat attached along the way.  I think of the way De Bernieres described Pelagia and Corelli in &quot;Correlli's Mandolin.&quot; That's my perfect 10 for fiction, and by comparison I'd put &quot;Sellevision&quot; on the pleasing side of a 5.<br />But on the whole, a very promising first effort that bodes well for Burroughs' future.  I definitely plan on checking out his future efforts as they appear on the scene.	2000-11-13

In my mind, 'Losing My Virginity' perfectly encapsulates the way a leader is supposed to think and act.<br />Ever heard Branson speak in public?  He's surprisingly shy, ill-at-ease, and not all that eloquent.  But the guy works hard every day at crafting his vision and pushing it forward one day at a time.  That's the genius of this book - Branson shows us the method he's used to succeed and admits that there's no great genius involved, but a heck of a lot of perserverance, determination...and a fair degree of flair!<br />My caveat at the beginning?  If you want a very different viewpoint of Branson's career, check out Tim Jackson's excellent &quot;Virgin King.&quot;	2000-11-13

Berendt was no doubt aided by a bit of seredipity in that the trials of Jim Williams provide him with a stong narrative line to the book.  But all kudos to Berendt: he found Williams on his own before the critical incidents took place, and he also formed relationships with a whole series of interesting characters in the Savannah environs.<br />Berendt brings a city to life as no other writer in recent times has done.  I just finished 'The Masters,' in which the author tried to weave the same magic about Augusta and the words just seemed to lay flat on the page.  Berendt's character and geographical studies are clinics in fresh, insightful writing.	2000-10-31

I literally fell across 'e' while looking for 'Syrup' by Maxx Barry...Matt Beaumont's first novel stood next to it alphabetically.  Just got off a Dulles-to-SFO flight and confirmed that these 346 pages can be devoured in one sitting.  I must have looked like a complete whacko sitting in my seat with tears of laughter running down my cheeks.<br />Folks, this may be the funniest book you ever read bar none.  And amazingly, it is told completely in e-mail format.  Takes you about 10 pages to get used to it, but after that it flows smooth and easy.  Who would have thought that such complete character development was possible via e-mail dialogue?<br />By the end of the book, you could show me 10 of these missives and I could identify the author of each one.  Beaumont is just amazingly creative in this effort.  The groundwork he lays for the intricate e-mail exchanges is breathtaking.<br />Just one character to watch out for (among many):  Simon Horne, head of Creative Services.  A completely amazing creation...all the more because Beaumont has no doubt drawn him from his experiences in the advertising industry.<br />I feel the need to spread the word about this great book.	2000-10-18

There are some great ideas in here - the essential component being that strategy and business concept innovation are best served when an organization foregoes the hoary 'strategic planning committee' approach and places its trust in the 'average' employee to uncover and develop these initiatives.<br />But damn, I'm ripped at having to pay so much for this book.  It clocks in at 314 pages when 200 or so would have had the same effect.  The main culprit are these inane pieces of randomly injected, 4-color clip art that serve no other purpose than to break up the text.  Not a single one of them clarifies anything that Hamel says here.  To think I paid a premium to justify this ridiculous layer of puffery.<br />This approach even extends to the book cover itself.  In an egregious display of immodesty, the spine of the cover features a color photo of the author himself.  Dude, you're a *management consultant*.  Recent surveys have shown that 90%+ of the population can't even identify a picture of Jack Welch for god's sake.<br />When steeling myself to actually read the words and ignore the other crap, I found the essence of some good ideas.  An early runthrough of the fundamentals of a business model is outstanding and makes a great reference.  I just wish I had waited for the paperback.	2000-10-16

Remnick is smart enough not to contribute just another Ali biography to the shelves, and instead focuses his efforts on Ali 1960 - 1965...from his post-Olympic days through to the second fight with Liston.  These are the years when Ali became Ali...the champ at the height of his powers.<br />But there's a special bonus in this book - a good portion of it deals with Sonny Liston.  You talk about your seminal 20th Century characters.  They don't get any more interesting than this guy:  the abused son of a sharecropper, long stretches of imprisonment, a fight career directed by mob interests, a violent death.  In short, a writer's dream.  Remnick brings Liston together with Floyd Patterson (and you'll never find a greater constrast) and walks you through these two battles before turning his attention to Ali.  Thus, you get a full portrait of Liston prior to encountering the force of nature that was then Cassius Clay.<br />The effect is a curious sympathy that you have for Liston as he enters the maelstrom developing around Ali.  In most retellings, Liston is cast as the personification of evil.  Remnick made me see him in a different light.<br />My advice for a great Ali study program:<br />1. Watch 'When We Were Kings' [Best documentary ever]<br />2. Read 'The Fight' by Norman Mailer<br />3. Read 'King of the World'<br />4. Buy any book featuring Howard Bingham's photography of Ali.	2000-10-16

It has next to nothing to do with the book...in fact, it's a distraction once you start to get wrapped up in the world of Scat and 6.<br />Thankfully, that happens on Page 1.<br />So don't let the cover put you off from buying and reading it.  Like the creative concepts that are the Holy Grail of this work, the inventive virtuosity that Barry displays in 'Syrup' is stunning.  It's a fabulously funny riff on marketing, filmmaking, and office politics.<br />And there are some damn good ideas in here, too.  The concept that Scat develops for the Classic Coke summer promotion (tagline:  'Wouldn't you die for a Coke?') is something I'd put on TV in a heartbeat (you have to read the book to appreciate the inspiration behind this line).<br />One further item of note:  very interesting to see the list of books under the amazon.com title &quot;Customers who bought Syrup also bought...&quot;  They're non-fiction treatises on the deconstruction on marketing and advertising.<br />I devoured these 294 pages in 24 hours and never had a better time reading a book.	2000-10-16

I started looking at some cookbooks, and this  offering from Mad Coyote Joe was displayed prominently.  Once you flip  through this book, it's as good as bought!<br />MCJ is upfront about his  background - he's not a trained cook, but he loves the food he makes, knows  it backwards and forwards, and has a passion for letting others know about  how to make the stuff he loves.  Most importantly, the language he uses is  clear and concise and is therefore accessible to all levels of readers,  including those like me who have to ask our spouses where they keep the  butter.<br />The recipe for Joe's 'Two-Chile Salsa' is alone worth the price  of admission.  This is the type of dish you bring to a gathering and as the  guests gorge themselves you're bound to get an incredulous &quot;*you* made  this?&quot;-type of reaction.	2000-09-07

And despite the changes in the Japanese  situation over the last decade (remember when we thought Japanese global  economic domination was an inevitability?), the applicability of the novel  remains fully in force today.  It gets to the heart of every Japanese  'salaryman' &amp; their internal struggle with their acceptance of that  lifestyle vs. their deeply internalized entrepreneurial yearnings.<br />The  breakthrough achieved by the book's protagonist, Nakasato, and the misery  that befalls his one-time officemate Ojima, might seem mundane on the  surface, but surely strike the average Japanese worker like a tremendous  blow to the chest.<br />Really top-notch stuff and far better than any dry  non-fiction, treatise in delivering insight into the Japanese business  mind.	2000-09-05

It's typical of all of  Feinstein's work in that his subjects have provided him with unfettered  access to their professional and personal lives.  For any anyone interested  in golf - or simply in competition at its highest level - the story that  Feinstein has pieced together around the 1998 major championships is an  absolute delight.<br />One seldom-mentioned aspect of the book that I really  enjoyed:  Feinstein tags along for the US Open Regional and Sectional  qualifiers, as well as for a British Open qualifier.  The qualifiers may  represent golf in its purest form, and he builds a gripping tale as various  strugglers try to fight their way into the big show.  It's a thrill to  hitch a ride on Larry Mize's back as he tries to qualify for the British.  Here's one shining example that it's truly not always about the  money.<br />Make sure you go for the paperback version of this book.  It has a  sizable 'Afterword' that summarizes the 1999 season, especially Payne  Stewart's redemption at Pinehurst &amp; untimely death, plus a recap of  Tiger Woods' breakout campaign.<br />One small complaint: the cover.  Okay...Duval, Stewart, Furyk and Woods were a compelling storyline in the  book because they each played a significant role in one or more of the  majors.  But where are the winners?  How about using shots of O'Meara,  Janzen and Singh instead?  Especially O'Meara, with two majors and Player  of the Year honors.  You'll telling me that Jim Furyk (Q Rating =  statistical noise) is going to sell more books that Mark O'Meara?  Feinstein does justice in his work to O'Meara's quest to wipe away his  reputation as &quot;King of the B's,&quot; but this cover is a real slap in  his face.	2000-08-31

And if you're a lawyer to boot, then welcome to nirvana.<br />In reading  various reviews, I was expecting a book with jawdropping twists and turns.  It's simply not so...the plot twists are more accurately 'swerves' and are  about as subtle as a sledgehammer.  Moreover, the reader can go 25 - 30  pages without a significant event transpiring.  [Most notably in the  author's shot-by-shot, interminable rendering of his (er, I mean, Charley  Hunter's) fantasy round at Augusta.]<br />Not that this makes a bad book.  Bobby Jones was a giant of American Sport, and although a work of fiction,  Veron's work really nails the spirit of a sportsman with a supreme  intellect.  Jones led a full life as a practicing attorney, and Veron's  take - done in sublime fashion - is that the full measure of the man must  take into account both his sporting and legal accomplishments.  This aspect  of the book alone makes the &quot;The Greatest Player...&quot; a very  worthwhile read &amp; certainly worth the 2 - 3 evenings it will take to  blitz through this sweet tale.	2000-08-19

I see Lewis' point  here - the boat is such a glaring example of the outrageous and extreme  aspects of Clark's personality that it's hard to ignore.  But there are  just too many pages dedicated to the subject.  The passages on the Altantic  crossing are especially numbing.  I was tempted to just skip the whole  thing.<br />It is interesting to see what time has already done to this  story...by focusing on Healtheon, Lewis has really chosen the weak sister  of Clark's three billion-dollar babies.  Indeed, the Healtheon / WebMD  story looks shakier by the day.  Furthermore, Lewis makes the case that  Netscape went public without profits simply because Clark wanted to build  his boat.  If so, he started a tsunami of no-hope companies down the same  road, leading to the dramatic April 2000 market correction.	2000-08-11

He and Dori Jones Yang really appeared to have connected in the writing of this book.  There's an effortless flow in the  telling that gives you a 'fly on the wall' insider's feel without getting  bogged down in coffee arcania or management dribble.<br />Schultz walks you  through some of the thought processes and actions that led to important  advancements in Starbucks' success with their customers.  And, he's not  afraid to point out when he's been dead wrong.  He's strong enough to admit  being dead set against the Frappuccino &amp; totally missing the boat on  what ended up being a blowout product for the company.<br />One comment - it's  hard for me to reconcile Schultz' recent fixation on the Internet, going so  far as ruminating about buying Williams-Sonoma for its online potential,  with the clear-headed thoughts expressed in this book.  [Yes, let's  see...I'll have a latte and this leather couch, thanks.]  Throughout the  book, Schultz shows a complete understanding of a company's need to please  Wall Street via growing profits, and also is quite clear of having to  evaluate each decision by asking &quot;Will it strengthen or dilute the  brand?&quot;	2000-07-03

After reading 'Twenty-Two Foreigners,' I'll second that opinion.<br />This  book successfully weaves a general description of the game, a review of all  Word Cups prior to US 94, and the author's own passion for his local team -  Wrexham, a Third Division Welsh club struggling to gain promotion to the  Second Division in 1993.  Pete Davies mixes these themes together  masterfully.  Despite these three unique threads, the book never seems  jumbled or hodge-podge.<br />Through Davies' sections on the history and  nuances of the game, you'll develop a keen appreciation for why certain  teams/countries deploy different playing styles and alignments without  feeling overwhelmed by jargon and technical detail.  In the overview of the  World Cups, you'll understand how world dominance has inexorably tilted  from its initial power base in the UK to the far reaches of Europe and -  especially - South America.  And in detailing his long-time affair with  Wrexham, you'll begin to comprehend the deep-seated passion for the  simplest of games which, unfortunately, has still not quite resonated here  in the States.<br />Despite the fact that the material is now seven years old  (Mr. Davies - an updated version in preparation for WC 2002 would be  fantastic!), I wholeheartedly endorse this book as a comprehensive and  engaging introduction to 'The Beautiful Game.'	2000-06-17

This book filled those needs and more.  It's a very compelling read...a finely crafted and expertly  researched work on the makings - and subsequent unmakings - of the Rat  Pack.<br />There are excellent portraits of the main protagonsists - Sinatra,  Davis Jr., Martin, Lawford and Bishop - and Shawn Levy draws a vivd  portrait of Las Vegas at the beginning of the 60s.  Levy's research brings  up five distinct personalities...despite the perceptions of 'clanishness'  that the public held about the Rat Pack, these were each very unique  individuals.<br />Levy weaves together a series of threads to make up the core  of the book, and one month after finishing it, there are three that linger  in my mind...<br />1. Sinatra's 'using' of Peter Lawford as an inroad to JFK.

Choose to be Fit, Healthy and Happy	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Tawni backs up her words every day	During the creation of the original Apple Macintosh, Steve Jobs' mantra was &quot;The Journey is the Reward.&quot;  Thinking about running a marathon for the first time?  The same expression applies.  It's not so  much the actual running of the race as it is the freedom, healthiness and  camaraderie you'll feel as you start to improve step-by-step through your  training.<br />No one embodies these feelings better than Tawni Gomes.  I run  with Tawni every Saturday as part of the San Francisco chapter of the  Galloway Marathon Training Program.  'No More Excuses' is a worthy  testament to the 100% effort I see her put in every week.<br />Running a  marathon takes discipline and hard work.  Watching Tawni, I know she hasn't  taken any shortcuts to get to where she is today.  If she's written about  it, she's done it first.  With the right training program and proper  discipline, anyone can run a marathon.  Let Tawni show you how.	2000-05-14
US	53092367	R2KT26LEJINTKB	0375404031	295818442	The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	Great book, great pictures, great leadership	Bookstores are flooded with various titles covering Shackleton's Endurance expedition, but I heartily recommend starting with this excellent release from Caroline Alexander.<br />The narrative is a well told accounting of the  origins of the voyage, the expedition itself, and a good epilogue that  feeds your desire to know what became of these guys after the completion of  the journey.  Alexander did her homework here - she talked to the few  remaining crewman still alive after all these years as well as the family  members of those crew members that have passed away.<br />However, what sets  the book apart from the rest of the field is the lush, magnificent printing  of 170 of Frank Hurley's stunning photographs.  The photos do more than any  words can to enhance the readers understanding of the stunning polar  conditions and deprivations suffered by the crew. Flip through any of the  other books about the Endurance, and you'll find a only small sub-set of  Hurley's photos, usually notable only by their poor reproduction quality  (Shackleton's own 'South' memoir springs to mind).<br />In addition to its  intrinsic value in describing one of the foremost adventurers of the Polar  Age, the book is also helpful to anyone looking to learn about leadership.  Shackleton took his responsibilities of leadership very seriously &amp;  practiced the art long before anyone like Peter Drucker or Tom Peters came  along to give it a name and study it.  Shackleton's tendency to be  inclusive rather than exclusive and his expert reading of the personalities  that comprised the crew were the key differences between survival and  death.  Alexander does a wonderful job reporting the episodes that capture  the essence of Shackleton's role as a true leader of men.	2000-05-09

In fact, Halberstam doesn't begin his coverage of the Series until  page 316, and then it's seven quick chapters (one per game) and a fine  epilogue to the completion at page 373.<br />Regardless, '64' is an  outstanding piece of work.  Written in Halberstam's inimitable style, the  book hops back and forth between the Yankees season and the Cardinals  season.  For true Yankee and Cardinal fans, the amazingly detailed &amp;  finely researched chapters on Mickey Mantle (Chapter 7, get it?) and Bob  Gibson are the absolute high points of the many richly detailed portraits  that form the core of the book.<br />On Mantle in 1964:  &quot;That spring  training was more an ordeal than ever for Mantle.  He was only 32, a  relatively young age for outfielders, but his body was an old 32.  Convinced by his family history that Mantle men died before they were 40,  he had never taken care of himself.  He had played hard and caroused hard  during the season, and he had both caroused and loafed when each season was  finished, letting his body slip out of condition by not doing even minimal  exercise.&quot;<br />On Gibson in 1964:  &quot;Later, in the seasons that  followed, as he watched Gibson intimidate opposing hitters, Tom Tresh  thought the Yankees had been relatively lucky in this series in the sense  that they were new to Gibson.  They were battling only his skills, no small  thing in itself, instead of having to battle both that and his reputation,  as teams would have to in the future.  For after this World Series he would  not be just Bob Gibson, he would be the great Bob Gibson, and his myth  would loom bigger, and because of that, in the minds of hitters, his  fastball would be faster, the slider would break sharper and wider, and the  word about how he shaved hitters with a fastball would be more  ominous.&quot;<br />Great stuff or what?  And plenty more where that comes  from.  The portrait of Gibson alone - all of it incredibly strirring  material about his hard work and perserverance in making it to the  Cardinals - stretches to 24 pages.<br />This book is an absolute must-read for  any true fan of baseball and its rich history.;<br />Great stuff or what?

More than just covering the fight itself, Mailer takes  in and reports the entire crazy scene in Kinshasa, Zaire, circa 1975.  It  must be noted that this book is as much about Norman Mailer (referring to  himself throughout the book in the third-person) as it is about Muhammad  Ali, but this results in some great reporting like in the one memorable  chapter where Mailer decides he's going to run in the early dawn with Ali.  <br />The best parts of the book deal not with Ali but in the richly drawn  portraits of the other important players.  Ali's mystical cornerman Drew  'Bundini' Brown is a revelation, and you won't find a better take on Don  King anywhere, despite the fact that this prose is now 25 years old.  The  real value of this work is that is captures the essence of Ali and Foreman  circa 1975, and - like 'We Were Kings' - subconsciously directs your brain  to compare these 'Kings' to the men they have become.  The natural tendency  is to recognize the true extent of what we have been deprived of by Ali's  descent into the grips of Parkinson's, but there's a corresponding shock  when reading about Foreman: to realize how this man totally reconstructed  his personality to turn himself into a multi-media star.

'Citizen Lazlo' is wider in its timeframe (1977 - 1992) and  focus (all over the map).<br />For flat out hilarity, nothing can beat (as  mentioned by an earlier reviewer) the &quot;Fit For a President Microwave  TV Dinner&quot; idea that 'Toth' pitches to the Campbell Soup Company.  [Sample:  Nixon-Mao Frozen Chinese Banquet...eat the meal that ended 23  years of hostility.]<br />My favorite has got to be his pitch to Kinney Shoes  for a new advertising campaign based on &quot;The Wind Beneath My  Wings,&quot; entitled &quot;The Feet Within My Shoes&quot;:<br />Did I ever  tell you you're my hero?<br />Tho' you're the farthest parts of me<br />I can run  faster than a beagle<br />You are the feet beneath my knees<br />The cadence of  these letters continues the unique,  hilarious style perfected by  Novello/Toth in his first book.  Check out a sample greeting to Nicolae  Ceausescu in 1988:  &quot;Belated Happy Birthday! Stand up!  You deserve  it!&quot;<br />Truly laugh-out-loud funny stuff.<br />One note of interest: since  this is the second volume, some of the respondents are in on the joke.  Those that are respond with a matching level of humor.	2000-04-05

Such an amazing &amp; hilarious compilation of letters and responses!  My sister-in-law had these books for years, and I always pulled them out to re-read every time I visited.  She finally gave them to me  for a recent  birthday.  You can re-read this book (and its companion volume  &quot;Citizen Lazlo&quot;) over and over and they never lose their  edge.<br />To truly appreciate this book, it needs to be placed into  perspective.  It was originally published in 1977, and the letters span  late 1973 through November 1976.  The main (although not sole) thread is  Watergate and its various actors.  You need to remember the mood of the  country at the time, and then understand the methods of Don Novello  -  liberal comic - posing as Lazlo Toth - uber-patriotic &amp; unreconstructed  Nixon man.<br />In this book (unlike some of the second), the respondents -  not in the joke - reply (mostly) with heartfelt thanks to whom they assume  is a true believer.  One can only imagine their reactions when they see  their earnest repsonses in print and placed in this hilarious context.	2000-04-05

I was born in 1961; Hiroshima occurred on my Dad's 15th birthday, Nagasaki three days later.<br />I am grateful - as I'm sure my father was - to Sweeney and his  heroic counterparts for the sacrifices they made to bring the war in the  Pacific to a conclusion.  Sweeney states his case firmly and directly -  without the bomb, Japan was willing to fight to the end; troop mortality  estimates for a planned invasion of Japan were astronomical.  Sweeney's  actions saved the lives of countless of today's fathers, grandfathers and  great-grandfathers (in America and Japan).<br />This book will make you  appreciate the seminal role played by General Paul Tibbets, whom Sweeney  salutes in the Acknowledgements as &quot;one of our military's great  leaders and the finest pilot I have ever met.&quot;  Considering the often  stifling nature of military bureacracy, watching Tibbets operate inside  military jurisdiction while essentially doing an end-run to accomplish his  goals is amazing.<br />Note that this is not a complete atomic history, but  more of a tale of the author's rise from wannabe pilot to commander of the  Bock's Car in less than five years.  [Dan Rather said it best in his review  of War's End:  &quot;...written with such detail, sweep, and compassion  that it might have been a novel and not an autobiography.&quot;]<br />As a  result, don't read this looking for revelations about Los Alamos,  Oppenheimer, etc.  The only connection you get there is that Tibbets  actions during this whole lead-up period to Hiroshima are somewhat of a  mystery to Sweeney, so you understand there's a whole lot going on in the  background that Sweeney is not privy to.  To fill in some of the gaps, I  recommend &quot;Target Hiroshima&quot; concerning Deak Parsons, America's  'Atomic Admiral' [Parsons makes an appearance in War's End as a key link to  all prior land tests; he also armed the bomb on the Enola Gay.]  Also, Paul  Tibbets has a rememberance entitled &quot;Mission: Hiroshima&quot.rior land tests; he also armed the bomb on the Enola Gay.]  Also, Paul  Tibbets has a rememberance entitled &quot;Mission: Hiroshima&quot.	2000-03-22

Want to know where Hornby finds the inspiration and raw material to craft the exquisitely detailed and accurate pictures of male angst such as Rob  Fleming ('High Fidelity') or Will Freeman ('About a Boy')?  Look no further  than the life of Hornby himself.<br />On the surface, 'Fever Pitch' follows  Hornby's life-long obession with Arsenal, the English Premier league team  he dutifully follows through good times and bad.  But this is more than a  story about football (or soccer, if you will).  It's also the story of a  complex person struggling to make things right with his family, the various  woman that pass through his life, and his career.<br />Make no mistake:  the  brilliant writer that created Rob Fleming did not appear overnight.  Like  Rob, Hornby struggled with his passions for years before achieving his  breakthrough with 'Fever Pitch.'  A previous reviewer notes that this is a  biography that does not work because of the author's lack of an  'interesting life.'  I disagree - the reason Rob Fleming connects with so  many readers (see the 'High Fidelity' customer review section for the  raptorous comments from men and women alike) is because of his normalcy and  our shock at seeing so many of our own thoughts crystallized so perfectly  on the page.<br />The same holds true for 'Fever Pitch,' but with the caveat  that a lot of what you read here is distilled through the experience of  English football.<br />My recommendation:  if you're a football/soccer  fanatic, this is a book you simply must read and keep in your collection,  regardless of whether you've read either of Hornby's other works.  If don't  know *anything* about the game and are not too keen to learn, read this  book only after you've read 'High Fidelity' and 'About a Boy.'  Then sit  back and marvel at the connections between the trilogy of characters that  are Hornby, Fleming, and Freeman.acters that  are Hornby, Fleming, and Freeman.	2000-03-19

Instead, this book is an insightful account of  how six very diverse personalities gelled to form one of the 20th century's  greatest comedic ensembles.<br />I'll second the opinion offered by the  California reader from Jan. 14, 2000 - this book is mainly about the Python  writing process.  In particular, it details the style and output of the  'Oxford team' (Jones and Palin) vs. the 'Cambridge team' (Cleese and  Chapman).  Then throw Idle's clever word play and Gilliam's revolutionary  graphics into the mix.  The book details how a side-splitting cohesive  whole was formed from these disparate elements.<br />Like earlier reviewers,  I'd like to see more on the post-Python careers.  Terry Gilliam gets a fair  shake with mentions of 'Brazil,' 'Jabberwocky,' and 'The Fisher King,' but  the Cleese/Palin team gets short-changed with no mention at all about  'Fierce Creatures,' their under-rated 'Fish Called Wanda'  follow-up.<br />Furthermore, as a fan of Michael Palin's BBC travelogues, it  was disappointing not to get some snippets about some of those excellent  works ('Around the World in 80 Days,' 'Pole to Pole,' etc.)<br />All in all,  if you're a Python fan, this is a quick bit of enjoyable reading that will  fill in and broaden your knowledge of the group.	2000-03-19

James Finegan literally knows the country - its golf, its people, its nature - like the back of his hand.  You get expert, finely crafted, hole-by-hole reviews of over sixty courses.  As a added bonus, there are restaurant reviews and lodging  suggestions.<br />The book is divided into geographical regions and is helpful  in helping you lay out your agenda.  Sure, you know to play St. Andrews,  Troon and Turnberry, but the book helps you go beyond the usual brand  names.<br />An example of how 'Blasted Heaths' can pay off:  Gleneagles is  quite the amazing golfing experience, but perhaps a bit too steep in the  wallet for this 20+ handicapper.  Finegan points out a course right next  door (Auchterarder G. C.) that, while certainly not in Gleneagles class,  has a 'handful of first-rate holes' at about one-third the cost.  A great  recommendation!  Not the holy, near-religious experience Finergan  associates with Royal Dornoch, Cruden Bay, and Machrihanish and others, but  it shows that the book can be used for all levels (skill and monetary) of  golf.<br />My one recommendation (seconded by Finergan) is that you spend a  couple of days in St. Andrews and soak up the environment.  There's enough  golf to keep you there for 3+ days, and the town itself has a real  university feel and exudes charm and history.  I suggest staying out of the  hotels and setting up in one the many cozy guest houses a block or two from  The Old Course.  My wife and I stayed at the Craigmore House (ph:  334-472-142).  You'll need a reservation, but it's well worth your planning  ahead.	2000-02-07

He's especially enlightening on the complex  character of Guilio Andreotti.  You'll cast a very arched eyebrow at  Andreotti's recent acquittal on all charges after reading Robb's account of  'The Honorable Senator.'

Unfortunately named 'Just do It' (and sounding like a company shill piece in the process), this is actually a fascinating look at Nike and its founder, Phil Knight.  Whenever the subject is Knight, you  cannot put the book down.  He is a truly remarkable individual.<br />Katz  covers all dimensions of the Nike juggernaut: the Knight engima; Nike's  rebirth after the rise of the inferior (in Knight's estimation) Reebok  aerobic sneaker in the mid-eighties; its association with Michael Jordan;  the jocky world of the Ekins; the designs of Tinker Hatfield and other shoe  creators; its relationships with Weiden Kennedy (developers of its ad  campaigns); and its offshore manufacturing difficulties.<br />To me, the  visits into Knight's inner sanctums are worth the price of the book, and  make it a truly fascinating read.  You get to see the man behind the  wrap-around shades, and he turns out to be a fascinating, complex  character.. you come away from the book with an understanding of Knight's  athletic background, his hatred of Olympic-style 'officialdom,' and his  will to win.  As much as Bill Gates defines Microsoft's corporate  character, Knight does for Nike.	1999-01-11

Points out again and again how its fanatical dedication to building a superior distribution system prior to anyone else figuring it out has been instrumental in  climbing to the top of the retail heap.<br />There's quite a bit of rehashing  of Walton's 'Made in America' autobiography (with J. Huey).  not really  much else Ortega could do there, given that the family chose not to  cooperate with the project.<br />The parts on overseas child-labor abuse and  small-town rebellion against Wal-Mart expansion at first seemed overwrought  and at times seem to beat the reader of the head with a hammer.  But the  chapter on the infamous Kathie Lee Gifford episode makes it all worthwhile.  Ortega really does a great job showing you how the incident unfolded.  And  although Gifford would seem to make an easy target in the whole affair,  Ortega actually gives her a fair shake - she goes through an education  process, and seems transformed into a credible spokesperson for independent  review of factories.<br />The real surprise in the book are the extensive  chapters concerning the contemporaneous decline of K-Mart.  Almost like two  books in one.  Ortega shows how an insular culture and a total lack of  Information Technology infrastructure doomed K-Mart.  The free-fall  described in Chapter 16 (&quot;Say It Ain't So, Joe&quot;) can be read  almost on its own.  CEO Joe Antonucci manicly swings from one strategy to  another in attempts to save it and himself.  The losses mount and the  pressure builds.  Meanwhile, the Wal-Mart metronome continues its steady,  inexorable beat.	1999-01-09
