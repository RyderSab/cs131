In reading this book, I thought I would find the closure in peicing together where Marvin's life starting going chaotic, but I did not find that. Everything written in this memoir pretty much repeated what Marvin wrote in his. I know at one point, there was a feud between Frankie and his older sister, who had differing views of their upbringing. Maybe she will write a book and we can get closer insight.	2004-01-19

I belong to a book club, in which several of those members have commented on this book. I withheld my comments(mainly because i didn't read the book in its entirety) but now i have done so and I am ready to speak (Derrick, Shayna,watch out).<br />I was terribly disappointed in this book. I am saddened to reveal that I share the views of the many who reviewed this book since print-And I adore this woman- but how could she be so delusional and misleading.<br />From the babies to her ode to sing, sing, and sing, I did nothing but shake my head in sympathy that such a talented woman can be caught up in such a state of confusion and denial. <br />She seems to offer no remorse to her family for her behaviors, especially after they appearingly raised her children in her absence. She speaks very little of the children and does not even offer the reader a glimpse of their faces. I was a bit saddened for her, as it appears that she still has not dealt with the desertion and eath of her mother, which she tries poorly to write off as a lie. Her not being reared by  her mother, however, clearly explains her relationship with women. She is a tad cruel and condescending towards her sisters, acting as if they were always trying to take from her or begrudge her. And when she finished with them, she moved onto the cousin. I am sure they could write a pretty memoir on her, as well. <br />I mean, this attitude that eludes from this book, I sincerely hope this is not the real Aretha, for if it is, I truly feel sorry for her and everybody around her. <br />I really wish I had held my ground and never read this memoir. For all you others out there who truly love this woman, this is not the book to read.<br />p.s. However, Aretha Girl, I want to give you a bravo for romancing Dennis Edwards. He was absolutely gorgeous in our day.	2003-12-04

Really enjoyed this read. it's the rare diva that writes a truly reflective, truthful memoir with inclusion of thier triumphs and mistakes. Ms. Khan comes across as comical in this book as she does in person. It is absolutely amazing that through all the abuse she has inflicted on hrself, she still possesses a pair of the best pipes in the business and is going as strong as she did in the beginning of her career. It is also so heartwarming that her family is so supportive and that she has made amends with her children and extended relatives. I adore her to pieces and I hope that voice continues to soar for another fifty years. Great read.	2003-11-07

But I sure don't this book. what was she thinking y'all? Was she ever a guest star on Fantasy Island because it's obvious she never left. I mean, no sense of reality here. Her odes of advice giving and support to Whitney, Natalie, and Lauryn were so laughable, for it seems that they can offer her some useful tips. I wanted to know why she split from Glynn Turman. Didn't happen.  I also wanted to know about the drastic chnage in her Atlantic years that resulted in their lack of promotion in their once most prominent star in the late 70's. Didn't happen.  And just of glimpse of her sons would have been nice. Grandkids, if any. This book was horrible. She blames everybody else for the wrongs in her life and takes no accountability whatsoever. So sad. and then the blatant lies!!!<BR>Give me a break-she couldn't remember why she wasn't married in her dad's church to Ted White. And 'who's' drinking ultimately destroyed that marriage-his or hers? <BR>I love this woman and I will purchase any of her recordings. But written work? Never again.

But believe me, this is no royal piece of literature. I did not get the impression that Aetha is being totally honest with us readers, and in viewing others comments, I see we are on the same page. I did not know she was having children at such a young age. And I am no idiot to believe that she \\"is unaware\\" of any controversy that resulted in the church after she virtually births two children almost back to back. I think ole C.L would have smacked her right down if he read that \\"Bravo daddy\\" comment- Some things you just keep to yourself. Unfortunately, she did just that in relation to her relationship with Ted White, which has always been alleged to be filled with action and confusion. <BR>I guess Divas will always have their share of catty-tudes with other performers, but Aretha takes the cake. It's real cute near the end of the book when she names specific divas in her book. As if now, that she has christened these women divas, they have now entered Diva-Dom. Yeah right!<BR>This book leaves you with a sour taste and does not give off the perception of Aretha being a nice person. I am so disappointed. I think this book alone will destroy any chances for future comebacks. I really did not enjoy this book.	2003-07-07

I adore the temptations, especially David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks. Now, I do appreciate a good groupie memoir, so it met my satisfaction in that area, but on the standpoint of taste and quality, I was very disappointed. I am rather bothered that Ms. Sapia insinuates that this book, in some shape, form, or faishion, was supposed to paint Ruffin in a more positive light, in contrast to the Otis Williams memoir. It most certainly did not!   ...If this book was written with the defining purpose of exploiting her relationship with the great, late Temp, I would have given it five stars, but as there is a deal of deception to the reading public, It only merits three from me.

I appreciate her for being so forthcoming with her experiences without losing any of her trademark, down home southern wit to guide the reader through each chapter. Her rifts with other performers struck me as interesting. You know, I can see, in also reading Aretha's memoir, where the two divas clash. Both ladies do have the tendency to act as if they started every musical trend and discovered everybody. Glady's account of the origin of &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; is totally false, as is her little conversation with Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole (Hon, Natalie was only maybe a year old). Nonetheless, her inside tips about the music business and juggling parenthood and the business i found very informative and useful, as i too, aspire to sing.

Though I do not think the book was as poor as other reviewers, I must admit I expected much more from her in terms of speaking on her experiences, highs AND lows, in the music business, as well as the significant lessons she has learned reaching this point in her life and career. But what did I learn most about her? She's a greedy pig! Every piece of food she has ever eaten she can recall, but recording dates and personal issues she's all a-blur. <BR>I did appreciate her vivid memory of her early gospel days and of her dad back in Detroit. That was clearly the best part of the book and seemed the most unbiased accounts recollected for this memoir.  In light of David Ritz's prior works, I am quite puzzled as to what went wrong with this assignment? I think Aretha should stick to writing songs and leave the books for the experts. I love her and am forever a fan.	2003-04-30

I don't know what she was thinking with that outfit on the Grammys and I don't know what she intended to gain by writing this confusing, dishonest, and unrevealing book! <BR>Her feuds with other performers, with the exception of maybe Luther, all point the finger at her as the culprit. She is less than kind to members in her own family. She is disillusioned that she created every musical trend and worse, was the trendsetter of clothing fashions (what a joke). And does she really have children? who would know? she rarely made any mention of them in relation to her rigors of parenting. <BR>I really hope that she comes to terms with her demons and gains back the respect of the many, very disappointing purchasers of this book.

I commended her for that. Her gambling addiction was another testament of how she overcame adversity and came out a winner, which was another source of inspiration for myself.  I also really appreciated her honesty in relation to her tenure with Motown and the treatment they received while on the legendary label. <BR>And then there was the dirt! What is the deal between she and Aretha?  I always perceived that they would be good friends, especially since both encompass such mesmarizing, soulful voices....

Though long overdue, in light of the recent death of her beloved sister, Erma, I finally read this autobiographical portrayal of my favorite diva, lady Soul.  However, this is not the woman I expected at all! I just wanted to fight her at several points in this book.  There were so many contradictions that made me so crazy.  <BR>Example#1- Her father was 'cool' with her birthing two children before legal adulthood, but took her on the road to monitor her behavior.<BR>Example#2- The Natalie Cole incident. I remember reading 'Jet' and 'Rolling Stone'magazine in the 1970's when she ripped the girl to shreads- is that ignoring her, as you put it?<BR>Example#3- The countless episodes with named and unmentioned men. While most of these men were labeled 'deceitful', she validates her philandering as \\"finding out where her heart was\\" Please, this from a girl who was having babies since 14.  <br />There are countless others, but I was really disheartened by her lack of female camaraderie amongst the other singers.  Aretha really, Barbra, Diana & Chaka are more than hard workers- they get the job done.  And I am a bit mystified as to why so little was written in response to the comments Gladys Knight made in reference to you in her book? The Esther Phillips reference was simply distasteful.You get the impression she wanted to speak in a ill manner about Leotyne Price, but thought twice. Whoever the 'mysterious diva' was who gave her the finger was, she was on the right track.    <br />Other parts just angered me. How dare she use this book as a forum to berate her sisters and cousin! Her brother, Cecil, was a well known substance abuser, which she failed to mention as she, also, did her father's infamous womanizing, which resulted in the birth of her unmentioned half sister. And I do not care how gifted she was, what \\"good father\\" allows his child to neglect her education to pursue a career when she could clearly have done both?<br />By now, Iwould suspect that this book is out of print. THAT IS A GOOD THING.  Hopefully, in a few years, one will forget that this trash was ever written! Extremely disappointed in the Queen.	2002-11-24

This book is very detailed in tracking the career of Ms. Franklin and tells of the accolades as well as the lowpoints in her career.  I found most comical the section in relation to Aretha's infamous fashion sense, but ultimately appauled by that tasteless photo of her in a one peice bathing suit with fishnet stockings showing her backside in concert.

However, after I saw the Temptations movie, I was left with a sour taste for it's surviving member, Otis Williams.  I brought this book to see if my hunches were valid, and I am afraid they are. Mr. Williams comes across very pompus,cocky,and disillusioned at times, and I did not particulary appreciate the picture he painted of the late, great Temps, like David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks.  <BR>I was equally mortified when he implied that Dennis Edwards was not worthy of induction into the rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Was it not \\"Cloud Nine\\" and \\"Papa was a Rolling Stone\\" that garnered the group its first Grammy awards?<BR>One must ask, other than being an original member, what did he really contribute? Reading this book, one get's the picture, which he tried very hard to paint, that he was the glue that kept the group together.  However,I see the contradiction. listening to him gloat, at times, of how the He and The Temptations virtually put other groups to shame with their live performances, I have to ask, \\"And what song do you sing lead on? co-lead?  If his one-liner in \\"Can't Get Next To You\\" (I can make the seasons change, just by waving my hand) is any indication of what he had to offer, it was best that he presumed his prized position in the group- background singer/dancer. <br />It was sad to read about the death of his son. However, he did not nearly go in depth about the emotional guilt he may have experienced. One get's the impression that the group name and legacy is his life and everything else is secondary.  Though I must admit, he looks good for his age and I'm happy he is still around to spread the Temptation legacy, it is also sad to see a 60+ male with nothing else apparently going for him outside of his \\"celebrity\\", and I use the term loosely.	2002-08-23

Though I was warned not to, I read this book and was absolutely crushed by Aretha's egotistical statements and ultimately, the lack of honesty to the readers, and most of all, to herself.<br />I grew up on and love Aretha for her many significant recordings, as they relate to my life.  But reading this book leads me to wonder, did I pick the wrong person to look to as a source of strength and heroism?<br />Now, to address the many lies. First off, how could 1971's &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and 1973's &quot;Angel&quot;, eclipse eachother when there is a two year lapse between them? Then, there's the touchy subject of her mother. I'm so sorry, but I was not convinced that your mother did not abandon you! Face the reality. No one waits over thirty years to clear up an inaccuracy of such great error. Then there's daddy- There is alot that you and I know you forgot to tell us about daddy, but I won't even go there. And since you were clearing up &quot;inaccuracies&quot;, I just knew you would touch on the rumored Glynn Turman incident involving your son.   <br />Her many moments of &quot;amnesia&quot;, too, did bother me throughout the book. I also grew somewhat disturbed in relation to the incident she shared regarding Richard Pryor. She can &quot;expose&quot; Richard, but made sure she stayed clear of mentioning similiar episodes involving ex-husband, Ted White. Also, I thought she was rather cruel to Mavis Staples and Cissy Houston with her comments, especially since it appears that they love her unconditionally (and yes, I read what Mavis wrote in Vanity Fair magazine). <BR>Lastly, I do not think Arehta is in any position to extend any prayers to Gladys, or anyone else for that matter- save them truly for the person who needs them most- YOU!!<br />I thought I was going to read the memoir of a Queen, royalty.  Turns out beyond the music, she's just a peasant, common folk.	2002-07-13

I particularly appreciated the inclusion of such greats as Esther Phillips (whom is so seldom mentioned these days), Nina Simone, and Chaka Khan, in which gave me some insight to her early years with Rufus.  The section on Millie, a truly under-rated singer, and the late Phyllis Hyman were also informative and worth the read.  I really appreciated Nathan's straight forward and honest, yet dignified, portrayal of the all the divas, until I got to the chapter's on Aretha, Diana, and Doris Troy whom Nathan, in my opinion, showed favoritism towards. While he did an excellent job of exposing the other divas, these three he seems to take pity- Aretha the most.  Adoration is understandable, but you hinted in other chapters about Aretha's less than royal behaviors, while in her chapter she was almost hailed as a saint! Same goes for Miss Ross. Friend or not, Doris Troy could and should have been replaced with the likes of Candi Staton or Mavis Staples.<br />Overall, the book is a delightful read and I would look forward to a part two, highlighting the likes of soulful artists like, Stephanie Mills, Minnie Riperton, Melba Moore, Candi and Mavis to name a few....	2002-07-11

Superb read, one of the classic musical memoirs of our time, along with Miles Davis' autobiography. The scariest part of this book, is that you will identify with some part of marvin after you are through reading- then you will go back time after time...<br />I never thought I would say this, but this book was almost too candid at times. I almost died when Marvin revealed his fascination for dressing up in women's clothing. And how about his inferiority complex in relation to younger brother, Frankie? How many people actually verbalize these real, yet taboo subjects?<br />I still mourn the loss of Marvin, beyond the music. Here, as you will read, was a soul crying for healing and sadly, life did not provide him with the solace he so desperately yearned for.

Before reading Patti's, I read Aretha's, which I ultimately felt like tossing in the middle of the street!  Great job! I thought the book was very inviting to the personal side of Patti.  I have always admired how forthcoming she has been with the public in relation to her late sisters. This book can truly encourage one to live life, as well as love and appreciate life.  <BR>However, there are a few things I would like to clear up, which I found inaccurate or inappropriate.  The Jackie Wilson episode I found rather distasteful, particularly since he is not around to defend himself(it was o.k. to slander Al Green). Also, as I had to do with Gladys in her book, I need to clarify a few inaccurate points you raised in your book. In reading your relationship with Atlantic Records in the 1960's, one is left with the impression your group wasn't given a fair shot due to the success of Aretha. Well, that's not totally true, since you were with the label two years before she signed on.  It just wasn't your time yet! Now is your time.  You sound greater and look more beautiful than ever.  You have a wonderful spirit in which people adore you far and near.  You are truly a blessing. Wonderful job.	2002-07-11

Despite her lack of success, I respect how she humbled herself to shower praises on other artists, including Aretha Franklin, who she accompanied on numerous of her classic recordings. This book also shows the struggles that she endured as a struggling performer raising a family.

Keeps the reader very interested as well as informed about the politics of the music business.  It's a shame that her voice was manipulated and pimped the way it was, not given recognition for classic hits such as &quot;The Doo Run Run&quot; and &quot;He's A Rebel&quot;.  This art of switching voices wasn't made public until the 1990's with the Milli Vanilli and Black Box scandel, but clearly this act had been in existence forever.  After learning that she was on the hit 1960's show &quot;Shindig&quot;, I purchased several of the classic videotapes. She was not exaggerating- she has a wonderful voice and deserves to be amongst the legendary pantheon of female singers.  I would recommend this book to any artist seeking to enter the music business for the pros and cons, and anybody, overall who just enjoys a good, rock and roll memoir.	2002-07-08

Amongst the most enlightening topics was the controversy that arose when Sam decided to sing secular music.  I had no idea that the church community turned their back's on him the way they did. Secondly, It was no surprise that Sam was a playboy, however, I did not know he fathered as many of the children mentioned. Most sadly, the tragic death of Sam still remains a mystery to me, and I would love to know if his killer is still incarcerated on her unrelated sentence, or even still alive for that matter. But the real shocker in the book deals with Bobby Womack's marriage to Sam's widow shortly after his death! And to even wear his clothing in public- how bizarre! The foolish things we do in our youth.  This was a thoroughly researched, well written book, with great attention paid to detail. This book is a must have to add to your home libraries.	2002-07-06

Overall, I found the book to be well written and worth one's money if you are a fan, but, as one of his classic songs are entitled, &quot;BEWARE! He may literally make you sick with his grandiose, egotistical, &quot;I am music, I gave music life&quot; persona. He truly believes he is the &quot;Black Sinatra&quot;, or as he puts it, singers, before his arrival onto the music scene, were either &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;leeches&quot;, or crybabies&quot;. <br />He outright tells Issac Hayes and Lou Rawls that they are not on his level as artists, not to mention that, according to this book, everyone from Muhammad Ali to Michael Jackson were living in darkness until he arrived on the scene and enriched their lives with his sacred wisdom and guidance- as if he was Jesus Christ. He even leads himself to believe that his deciding to do commercials in the 1990's lead to some sudden surge of black artists being offered commercial endorsements, citing B.B. King and Aretha Franklin- Oh Please Barry! Both Aretha's and B.B's respective careers have endured longer and achievements are far greater than yours. And by the way, they were singing jingles before you came on the scene.   <br />The most sickening moment, however, has to be his comments in regards to the late, great, Marvin Gaye, whom he appears convinced he could have straightened out- And, of course, Marvin begged him to produce him!  <br />Throughout the book, he makes numerous suggestions as to the many artists who have come to him asking him to produce them.  Funny thing though, outside of his groups, Love Unlimited (Orchestra), he has never! <br />Not suprisingly, he also fails to mention that his big comeback hit, 1994's &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot;, was actually written and produced by Gerald Levert. So Barry, that, my friend, was the key to the success of your album, &quot;The Icon is Love&quot;. And boy, isn't it strange, after reading this memoir, you will have to ask yourself, &quot;If everyone was worshipping Barry, who was listening to Luther? Just a thought. <br />Barry is much too full of himself- literally and philosophically. If you can stomach his overly inflated ego, you actually may enjoy this book!	2002-07-06

After reading this book, I'm sure &quot;The Boss&quot; was not pleased, but this unauthorized account of Ms. Ross' life and career will keep the reader interested throughout.  In honesty, I think Tarabollerri did a tasteful job in depicting, Diana, the good witch vs. Diana, the most wicked.  While many passages in the book attempt to defame Ms. Ross' character, I found these moments comical at best.  It has always amazed me that Diana, seventy pounds at best in her early years, managed to evoke so much fear amongst her peers- why didn't anybody just slap her? I think artists point Diana out as the target due to their fear of confronting the man behind the monster- Berry Gordy.  <BR>I am not a big Diana Ross fan, but after reading this book, if you like her or not, you will have to agree that she is a very driven, hard working individual, who, ultimately, got everything she strived for- and then some.  I have an immense amount of respect for her.  She was thinking like a man way before it became fashionable. Great read.	2002-07-06

Oddly, this was the hardest book to locate, not to mention the only book written on the life of Ms. Washington.<BR>Knowing very little about her life, this book is a great introduction into Ms. Washington's early life in Chicago, and her introduction to the music business. It also highlights her many hit recordings as well as her legendary track record of marriages.  Most importantly, this book paints a picture of a  woman confronting the everyday battles of life, including her infamous attitude, problems with weight, and career disappointments. Ms. Washington comes across as a very complex, yet comical individual, and reading will be at the delight of the reader.  <BR>However, this book could easily have garnered the full five stars had it given more in depth information and feedback on her childhood and the relationship with her family, including pictures from her early years, her family, and her husbands, and more commentary from her musical peers.<BR>The world truly lost a national treasure with the loss of Ms. Washington. Much to our benefit, this book, along with her timeless recordings, allows the Queen's legacy to be upheld for generations to come.	2002-07-03

I loved how she portrays herself as this young, naive child, who innocently gets pregnant twice, by two different men, all before her eighteenth birthday. I particularly loved the \\"bravo daddy\\" comment in reference to her second pregnancy, in which she is leading readers to believe that her father, the minister, was in total agreement with. The justification for her dropping out of high school was another funny moment. She notes that she skipped grades repeatedly- well, I'm puzzled- why didn't you make it to the twelfth grade?  Interesting, too, was the incident with Sam Cooke- so what he was married and eleven years her senior. She never goes into depth about any of the incidents she's encountered with the other female singers and even lashes out at the females in her family- while all the men are saints! Little/no mention of her experiences of motherhood. No tips for aspiring artists on how to endure in the music business. This book has no purpose! <BR>But then again it does.  Sadly, Ms. Frankin represents the child who is praised for their talent and taught no sense of self worth or self love outside of their talent.  I would recommend that  parents read this book in hopes that they will think cautiously before pushing their children into the spotlight. Even in these late stages of her life, Aretha apparently still does not have a clue in regards to who she really is and what her purpose on this earth is...	2002-06-20

I thought the book was poorly written and edited. The information contained in this book could have been summed up in a two hour interview. There are no dates given throughout the book, not to mention the little mention of her song catalog- her hits and the stories behind them.  She even failed to state her birth name and birthdate. I think greater justice can be done to Ms. Staton's legacy if a biography was written incorporating this book into an expanded, in-depth look at the life of this soul turned gospel legend. I would suggest, in all love, that Ms. Staton grab the microphone before reaching for a pen again.	2002-06-19
