What a revelation to hear so many ideas that I thought were mine alone repeated over and over by the participants of Mr. Arnett's study.  I must admit that I'm only a lowly marketing researcher, but I don't see any glaring errors in his methodology.  He never said metalheads were a unique group or the only adolescents with problems OR that there weren't outliers in the real world.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book immensely, especially the profiles.  As I was reading it I just kept saying, \\"Hey that's exactly what I used to say!\\"  I am/was a metalhead, I played in countless bands in my teens and early 20s and now I'm 34 and just received my Iron Maiden Powerslave enhanced CD in the mail a week ago.  I lived for music, Heavy Metal and Punk.  I slamdanced all the time, went to endless concerts, played endless concerts, had hair down to my arse, owned a collection of concert t-shirts and ripped jeans, and even wore spandex at some point.  But unlike most of the people in the study, I was straight edge, got good grades and had many friends (including girl friends).  To clash with another of Arnett's theories, my household was the model for hyper individualism but my parents added to that a spark of integrity that made all the difference.  I did whatever I wanted to, but always kept in mind the effect it would have on others.<br /><br />This book covered all the major points I would have made if I had written it when I was 15.<br /><br />1) Hair bands and bands that write about sex and partying are not Heavy Metal.<br /><br />2) Many heavy metal musicians are extremely talented.<br /><br />3) The world sucks and everyone has their heads up their bums.<br /><br />4) Listening to loud music and slamdancing are great ways to burn off steam.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Arnett, I wish I would have found this book when it first came out.	2004-12-24

Although the book only has a page or two about clockwork it helped me to setup a method for creating all kinds of devices.  Mr. Melchor has everything worked out in minute detail, from the beginning research that needs to be done to the cost of the body and special powers and disabilities that modify the effectiveness and cost of golems.  As a bonus he adds in Simulacra (creating living creatures that resemble other creatures) and Automata (constructs that mix magic with a physical machine instead of trapping a spirit).<br />At the very least you could ignore the details and use the special powers and new body types to make unique constructs for your players to fight.  Let's see how surprised they are when that boring old stone golem breaths lighting on them or self destructs.<br />Great book, I will be looking for more of the same quality work from this author.	2003-02-06

I've been putting off reading Ender's Game for about 8 years now.  Every time I would get in a discussion about books the question would come up and I would have to shamefully hang my head and admit to not having read IT yet.  \\"But I do have it on my hot list, and I am planning on reading it soon.\\" I would declare lamely.<br /><br />So last year I made a New Year's Resolution to finally read it.  I finally found it on tape unabridged and drove about 40 minutes to a library in a different city to pick it up.<br /><br />Over the course of two weeks I read/listened to it and I was in shock.  Nothing happened.  It was generic sci-fi.  Halfway through I started to realize the story wasn' about him fighting aliens, it was about him training to fight aliens and actually my favorite part was what was happening with his brother and sister back on earth.<br /><br />I never really understood the political situation on earth, who was allied with whom, or what the hedgemon was.<br /><br />Yes of course I was touched by the little boy's plight but the entire book was just a bunch of filler so that he could pull off a startling climax.  Then there's the last chapter or two which should have just been stapled into the book as a late addition. The chapter should have been titled -Setup for the Sequel-. It just didn't fit, it was like you saw someone turn off the video camera and then start it back up somewhere else.  I believe he should have kept it a short story, the climax wasn't worth 300 pages of semi-boring, (though well written) fluff.<br /><br />I think comparing this book to Dune is like comparing -Tom & Jerry- to -The Simpsons-.  It's a whole different level of entertainment.	2003-01-17

This is my favorite rpg book - EVER.  The art, although not in color, is worth the cover price alone.  Add to this, 1) monsters that practically write adventures around themselves (and if they don't, adventure hooks are listed for each one), 2) Legends and lore - tidbits of information your PCs might have heard about the monster (listed by rarity), 3) Detailed information on what types of treasure each monster would have and so on...<br />Each monster gets at least 2 pages (sometimes 3 or 4).  Each has a story about how the author, Viktor Pendrake, encountered them.  The trolls are absolutely fabulous, why would anyone use a normal D&amp;D troll (with their ridiculous noses) after seeing the ones in the Monsternomicon.  Plenty of undead, contstructs, and twisted races.<br />Some of the stuff seemed kind of \\"out there\\" for my world, so I made them outsiders just because I couldn't stand the thought of NOT using them in my campaign.<br />Buy this book, you'll agree that this is the standard to which all monster collections should be held.  This puts the Monster Manual 2 to shame in every possible way.	2002-12-18

It's a cool situation and definitely able to fit into almost any campaign world.  There's enough fighting to keep it interesting, a lot of room for role-playing, and some great horror elements. My party ended up each allying with a different faction, almost to the point of fighting each other.<br />My only problems were that although the npcs were detailed well, with sections on background, current agendas, and even sketches, none of them said what they were carrying other than basic armor and weapons.  No equipment, no treasure, no magic items.  It was really kind of inconsistent that Ofec killed his high-level necromancer master but didn't take any magic items off his corpse and that later the corpse (returned as a zombie) didn't have anything on it.  But that's easy to fix.<br />Like the other guy said, it is short and because you have to run a large number of NPCs at the same time I wouldn't recommend it to beginning DMs.<br />Overall a very cool adventure, I'll be picking more modules from Mr. Mearls when I get a chance.	2002-08-26

Finishing this book, I felt like Sisyphus eternally rolling the (book) stone up his hill - the task never ended. Random words on a page would have been marginally more entertaining and could have possibly held more meaning.<br />There is one character in this book. The rest are just names (with an occasional, conservative dash of personality). This single character is completely unlikable, uninteresting, and ultimately incomprehensible, as he is split into multiple \\"personalities\\".<br />The story covers a couple hundred years taking 20-40 years at a leap between every other short chapter. This gives the story a rushed feel or makes the reader feels like he's reading a history without much detail (or an outline).<br />Strahd makes an appearance and is equally uninteresting and has no personality. The ending is confused and sad...	2002-06-06

US	52778776	R3N5GZ6GSA0CHA	1563891336	45969474	Death: The High Cost of Living	Books	2	5	19	N	N	Snooze fest	I love a lot of Gaiman's stuff, but this is really bad.  No action at all, almost no &quot;magic&quot;, a completely unlikable supporting character, and supposedly touching ending. It's really short, and besides a witty line or two there's just nothing there.  It's not like I have to have muscle popping heroes in leotards, to enjoy a graphic novel but this is just really good stuff to fall asleep to.  Try anything by Alan Moore or Warren Ellis instead.	2002-04-27

What you get for your [money] is: Insight into the rave (and other) subculture(s); conspiracy theories (from the Philadelphia Experiment to a not so subtlely masked version of the scientologists); a full education pertaining to the effects of experimental, mind-effecting drugs; graphic depictions of group sex; an introduction to social programming and its effects; and a glimpse into the idea of consciousness evolution. This is like Robert Anton Wilson's _Prometheus Rising_ written as fiction.<br />If the concepts are new to you, you may be left behind (or may be forced to reread) but I don't think this stuff is too far out of anyone's grasp. Just remember that all of this stuff isn't fiction. Many people believe in some of these concepts and live these types of lifestyles, it's just that most people aren't aware they exist. My favorite line in the book is, \\"... the kind of thing that everyone talks about doing when they're in college, but then never does because they get swept away in the current of real life's events.\\" (That's paraphrased a bit) Been there, done that?	2002-03-19
US	52778776	R13R98HASU706Z	1872372171	786983380	Storm Warriors (The Orfeo Trilogy, Book 3)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Not just hack-n-slash	This is the third book in the Orfeo trilogy, the first two being _Zaragoz_ and _Plague Daemon_.  While these books are called a trilogy they are only very slightly linked by the narrator being the same person.  Orfeo is captured and forced to tell stories to earn his freedom. He does have his own story, but it is something that is never resolved. You only actually see Orfeo in action during the preludes and epilogues.<br /> I liked this one at least as much as the first book and definitely better than the second book, so even if you were disappointed by _Plague Deamon_ I would still suggest this one.<br />_Storm Warriors_ is, rather obviously, set in the Warhammer fantasy world, on the Island of Morien.  A young king and his best friend, the court bard (also an aspiring druid) must deal with a group of shipwrecked sea elves that have landed in their country.  They know there is something wrong with the elves but their knightly code forbids them action until there is proof of their hostility.  The land is plagued and the fealty to the king is at an all time low, as the smiling 'friendly' elves continue to gain favor among the people.<br />Though the first two-thirds of the book are a bit low on the usual Warhammer hack-n-slash, the last third is action packed.  I was impressed with the writing, especially the music magic and the scenes where Slanesh shows up.  Just a side note, Brian Craig is a pseudonym for Brian M. Stableford.	2002-01-08

The premise is interesting but not really interesting enough for a novella. The first 90 pages drag so much that I almost gave up a couple times.  I have enjoyed many of Tanith's stories, but if you're looking for something that will keep you awake try _Tales from the Flat Earth_, they are my all time favorite fantasy novels.  Much more plot per page and an originality that is simply mind-blowing.	2001-12-29

The first hundred pages are filled with exotic descriptions of strange places and people, almost so much that the story barely crawls along (but what an amazing crawl).  It's like Anne Rice writing cyberpunk. The character is walking from point A to point B. Five pages of description later, he is almost there and it was a mind blowing five pages. Rice writes beautiful descriptive passages, Olsen writes acid trip, 1000-ideas-a-second, manifestos. So as far as a coherent story goes, I'm not sure how it holds up, but as for enjoyment it's definitely a lot of fun.<br />The uneveness comes with the rest of the story, which moves much faster and becomes a long chase scene.  Olsen uses many accents (and colloquialisms) in the book so that I was often lost as to the meaning of what some of the characters were saying.<br />In many ways this novel reminded me of Jeff Noon's _Vurt_ so if you liked _Vurt_, then you should give it a try.	2001-12-13

This book gives insight into the minds and personalities of all the characters involved.  I think Asprin really had to change something or risk becoming repetitive or stagnate (he pretty much says so in his introduction).  He tried something new and I enjoyed it, although at a different level.  This book didn't have as many laugh-out-loud moments, but it has a bit more plot than normal and since it's the beginning of a 5 book contract he was able to start some multiple/cross book subplots.	2001-12-13

So first I started seeing old copies of Groo laying around in comic stores and wanting to get them.  Unfortunately i'm a completist, so I couldn't start in the middle.  Then I finally found this collection of the first four comics.  I was worried that it might be stupid and I might just be being nostalgic, but it paid off.  The art is really cool and it's funny too.<br />Now I just need to find #2 in the series.  Fortunately it looks like some of the collections are still in print.	2001-11-07

So then I got if for Christmas and finally got to it a couple weeks ago.<br />I wouldn't call it a waste of time.  There are some very funny parts (mostly in the beginning and the end) and it's definitely unique. But...  the story didn't really hold together well for me.  It was more like a bunch of short stories set in the same place, as Gowdy takes one character at a time and exposes their strange (though I'm sure more common than most people think) lives.  I wasn't disturbed by the amount of sexual material in the book but anyone that thinks this book is about some cute, angelic child should definitely beware.<br />Another reviewer mentioned purpose and resolution. I would have to agree, the ending didn't really explain much or give you any idea about the future of the family members.  I don't think there really was a point Gowdy was trying to get across, unless it was &quot;life is stranger than it looks at a glance&quot;.	2001-10-23

Not much happens in this story that could have aptly been called _A Walk Through Fairyland&quot;.  There is no main 'objective' just the main character (the only character) wandering around meeting people or fairy creatures in a very linear fashion. The ending really didn't have much of a conclusion and the extremely liberal use of quotes was distracting from the story.<br />  It would have been much better if the prose was dropped and the songs were just collected.  If you like no action, no character development and overwritten description give this book a try.	2001-10-03

There were no surprises (the entire story is a flashback), at times it was just really gross (as other reviewers have mentioned), and the link between the silk maker's daughter and the queen was tenuous at best.  Most of the story just read like a history, I felt no connection with the characters.  I love tragedies but I don't think there was a single happy moment in the entire story.<br />So if you like beautiful prose and being depressed and grossed out I would suggest this book to you wholeheartedly. On the other hand, if you're looking for any kind of plot, action or meaning look elsewhere.	2001-09-25

I agree with other reviewers, this stuff is pretty heavy, but I'm not buying that Rollins has actually killed people.  If he wanted to make all this horror seem real he should have left out the unbelievable stuff.<br />I did enjoy reading the book (I liked the long stuff better than the shorter pieces) though it was repetitious at times.  I like his take on dating (Mekanik) and his hatred for drugs, guns, and crime is commendable.  I will definitely be reading more Rollins in the future.	2001-09-08

There's absolutely no action.  The 'monsters' don't show up until the very end and then they do absolutely nothing.  The style is just a gimmick and totally ripped off.  I don't understand the links to the happenings back in his hometown.  I think he just threw the sex in there to make sure people were still awake.<br />It's just really bad - don't waste your time.	2001-08-05

But I will say this book is full with 700 pages of extremely cool ideas.  I was never bored and always in awe of some new idea.  It mixes all the things I like in a book: magic, technology, philosophy, action, horror, humor and characters that are all shades of grey as opposed to &quot;sparkling white heroes&quot;.

My biggest problem is that 12 bucks and 6 comics later not much has really happened - it's like reading the first 3 chapters of a 400 page novel.  So if you're looking for any kind of closure - it's not here.  I picture myself reading _Promethea Book 12_ two or three years from now saying, &quot;She *finally* understands her destiny and her powers.&quot;<br />I would recommend waiting for a compiled version or at least waiting for book 3 to come out so you can feel like you read and finished a book rather than just sampled it.	2001-07-20

Some, like _The Colossus of Ylourgne_ or _The Garden of Adompha_ stay rooted in some fantasy realm of monsters and magic; while others, like _Vulthoom_ or _The Eternal World_ wander into space, dealing with timeless aliens and strange silent races.<br />Overall I would NOT suggest this as a starting point for aspiring C.A. Smith fans. Although it does give the feel for Smith's writing style, it doesn't seem to be the strongest collection 'plotwise'.  Some of the ideas are good but are just not given enough detail to make them shine and others seemed less 'dark' than they could have been with a little extra effort.	2001-07-09

There's nothing new here other than making space opera realistic by using realistic (if somewhat stereotypical) characters.  I did enjoy _Shards of Honor_ and I like the characters but there are really no ideas, nothing new.  It's almost as if Bujold started writing background notes for her next story then just added some action scenes and called it a book.<br />I didn't hate it, it just makes me feel like I just got done watching a soap opera. I guess I'll give a couple of the Miles books a try and see if I like them any better.	2001-06-29

I was left confused and wanting to know (and understand) more about the background/social/political/cultural aspects of Earth in the 23rd century.  I felt like I was reading a sequel and I was just supposed to know all about it already.<br />There's really no action and the last 30-40 pages are a long dialogue explaining the motives of all the characters and the basic plot.  Then it cuts off dramatically with not even an epilogue.<br />It was interesting at times, the writing was good and the plot fairly original but it just didn't do anything for me.	2001-06-19

It just didn't feel the same, it was almost like an extremely long ending to _I Claudius_.  In many places it read like a history book and of course there was nothing that could compare with the antics of Caligula or the battles with the germans from _I Claudius_.<br />I probably won't give up on Graves, but I wouldn't suggest reading this book.	2001-05-19

But I loved it.  My biggest piece of advice is that if you get bored in the middle, keep reading.  Erickson ties everything up in the last 100 pages rather spectacularly.<br />Don't expect everything to make a lot of sense in this book.  People suddenly end up in different times and different places just by walking down a hallway or into a field, characters are found dead in the middle of the novel and then show up in the end as a kind of flashback.  Like I said, very surreal and dreamlike.  It's not really sci-fi although some of it is set in a somewhat futuristic, noir dystopia.	2001-04-12

Jeter is very creative and original, this is kind of a funny version of _The Anubis Gates_ and also similar to Gaiman's _Neverwhere_ and _The Physiognomy_ from Jeffrey Ford.	2001-03-28
US	52778776	R1386SM3CDOWSC	0736643931	641199639	Children Of God	Books	4	1	1	N	N	I was worried but not disappointed	I liked it.  I was worried this book might suffer from extreme sequelitis but it was really good.  The characters weren't as lovable as the ones in _The Sparrow_ but still very realistic.  In _The Sparrow_ I kept wishing there would be more interaction with the aliens and in _Children of God_ I got it.  I loved all the philosophical/religious dialogue/debate but was infuriated that no (maybe not enough) revenge was taken on certain characters in the story.  The only real problem I had with the story was keeping track of the aliens and I think that is a side effect of reading it on tape.<br />Ok when's the movie coming out?	2001-03-27
US	52778776	R31T0IQD9RFE88	0553268724	45692172	Strange Toys	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Left hanging	Ok first the good news.  I loved Geary's writing style, her characters were very real and her descriptions very poignant.<br />Now the bad news.  I kept turning pages expecting some kind of answers or a conclusion but got absolutely nothing other than some very Budda like statements &quot;If you believe it happened then why does it make a difference if it did or not?&quot;.  You never find out what happened to Deane, you never find out anything about Sammy.  I'm assuming that Alonso and Barnett are angels (can't remember what she called them) but that just makes part 2 and part 3 almost exact copies of each other.<br />So I would say it was an enjoyable experience up until the end when you realize none of your questions are going to be answered.  Some people love endings left open for speculation, others hate them.  If you don't hate them, read this book it's good, especially if magical realism is your 'thing'.	2001-03-19
US	52778776	R1O7KN8FFQ7KAF	0812572114	48573968	Child of An Ancient City	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Not bad	I've only read _Caliban's Hour_ by Tad Williams but I liked that much better than this book.  I've also read some shorter works by Hoffman which I've had mixed feeling on.  This seemed more like a long, short story.  It did seem rushed because there was a lot in the story. A main setting of some men having dinner and then one of them telling a story and then the characters in that story telling many stories.<br />As confusing as that sounds it wasn't a confusing read.  I like the arabian setting and it was funny at times but nothing really impressed me about it, except for one of the stories told within the main story.<br />I think it would be more impressive for someone just getting into fantasy as opposed to a veteran.  Though as the last reviewer mentioned it may not correctly represent Williams' 'normal' style of writing.	2001-03-14

The use of the 1st person narration made for too much introspection, especially as the relationship between Releanna and J'role was the biggest part of the plot.  The Therans being a mix of all different races didn't seem very realistic and there was only one hint of a horror in the entire story (and they are probably the coolest thing about Earth Dawn).  The Crystal Raiders were great, but other than that I didn't find much to like about the story.	2001-03-07

The science was pretty silly (a planet that stays still), and the world needed a bit more fleshing out.  It's almost like a detailed outline.  The scale of the story is huge but there's little or no detail.  It would have been much better to see Jack in action stealing things and outsmarting people rather than conquering the world.<br />I'm not sure I understand the symbolism of the story.  If Morning star was trying to prevent Jack from following in his footsteps why did he have him do what he did?	2001-02-20
US	52778776	R959DIUP2XCN9	0380793326	678851862	The Physiognomy	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Original and fun	If you're hoping to see a concise study of physiognomy turned into a piece of fiction, look elsewhere.  This is just really original and fun.  Great weird characters, very dream-like, hallucinogenic interludes, great writing and a pace that keeps the story moving.<br />Definitely not for the hard sci-fi buff, some things are never explained and it gets to be almost a bit light-hearted after the main character 'changes' - I liked him better in the beginning of the story.  Didn't know there was going to be a sequel, I don't really see where he can take it from that ending but I'll probably find out.	2001-02-08

Then there was _Pandora_ - not bad but not great. Then _Vittorio_ - was this a short story? and then _Merrick_ - wake me up when it's over or when Lestat says a couple words. Now _Violin_ - the story starts about 200 pages in and ends about 50 pages later.  This books seemed more like writing practice for Mrs. Rice.  Her writing is so beautiful but NOTHING happens.<br />Next...	2001-01-31

This makes it fairly original but puts the reader at a distance from the characters.  Events happen too fast (especially the ending), with not enough description.  It's almost as if it's written in short story-like prose.<br />It did have lots of magic, fighting, gods, magical creatures and the like but all of these were taken directly from legends, so in this sense the story was very unoriginal.	2001-01-19

Not as much action in this one in that it all takes place in the bazaar as opposed to Skeeve being chased through alternate dimensions. It wasn't as funny as the others but it was still good.  For it's length it was worth it.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it if it was a lot longer.<br />Asprin has created the most unforgettable set of characters I can think of. I feel like I have lived with these characters all my life (but I guess I almost have considering I started reading them years ago).	2001-01-06

Unfortunately many of the stories are told at such a high level (low detail) that it's like reading a plot summary.  Also just about every sentence is filled with long fantasy names, with hundreds of characters making appearances only once sometimes to reappear 2 tapes later.<br />I would not suggest trying to read this book.  Do it on tape (or CD)ONLY.  You could spend the whole day just trying to pronounce the names on the first couple pages.<br />Also the last story is just a review of what happened in _The Lord of the Rings_ so if you haven't read that yet (yes there are people out there that haven't read 'it' yet) then read it first or you'll ruin some surprises.	2001-01-04

Another problem I had was with certain levels of technology that were definitely out of sync with the times - even by today's standards that would be tough (I don't want to spoil it for future readers).<br />If you like tough reads, similar to Pynchon's stuff, I'd say try this for sure.  The setting and characters alone made it enjoyable enough to be worth it.	2001-01-02

But did I mention that it was really long?  I think that if you really studied this book you could create an entire 3 dimensional model of mars.  Mr. Robinson describes nearly every peeble and crevise on the planet as if he spent 16 years there wandering the barren wastes.<br />The bottom line is - clip 200 pages of scenery description out and it would get 4 stars.  I would have never finished this book if I was reading it in book form.  I did it on tape and it took me about 3 weeks.	2001-01-02

I actually read this book quite some time ago but remember being ,for the most part, lost by references to details that were maybe too 'detailed'.  I do believe Eco is brilliant but many of the references in the book were to ideas or concepts native to Italy and times before I was alive.<br />My distaste could be because after _Focault's Pendulum_ I expected so much.	2000-12-29

The hero is a nice guy with a bit of a psychological problem and some 'real-life' problems as well.  The situation, while futuristic (a space colony complete with a friendly alien race) is extremely matter of fact.  This makes it a bit slow (and downright boring at times) but very 'immersive'.  The main character was fleshed out well and I really felt that I knew him by the end of the story.  The ending was also very interesting.<br /> If Pohl was trying to write something different I think he achieved his purpose.  I wouldn't want to read many books like this but it was a fairly fresh approach to sci-fi (although I can't claim to be a sci-fi expert).  I did this book on tape unabridged and I would recommend it in this format.  The narrator sounded a bit amateurish at first, but after one side of the first tape I realized he was perfect for the somewhat simple main character (narrator).	2000-12-04

Some of the explanations were a bit of a stretch too.<br />I'm coming to this book after reading _The Anubis Gates_ (last year) and I really liked that so this book was a bit of a dissappointment.  I would suggest it to Powers fans, but don't come into it thinkiing it's going to be another _Anubis Gates_.	2000-11-24

Everyone in the story seems to know about everything that happens in the book and they all take turns analyzing the situation(s) ad nauseum.  But none of the theories are ever proved true or untrue, and as many know, the story ends in the middle of a sentence leaving ABSOLUTELY no resolution to the problem.<br />I guess I'll wait another 5 years and try _The Trial_ or _Amerika_.	2000-11-22

This isn't your average sci-fi novel.  It's really funny and more of a modern world setting with outrageous things happening to outrageously eccentric people on a college campus.  It reminds me of some of William Browning Spencer's stuff, but I like this better.	2000-11-17

There's not a lot of science in it or action, but it was anything but boring for me.  The whole story is about ecological disaster brought about by humans colonizing an 'uncivilized' planet.  The narrative stays fresh by using a writer that is constantly interviewing people that lived on the planet Peponi as a main character.  In some chapters the writer is speaking, in others humans that used to live on the planet, in others natives that have lived through the colonization.<br />I'll definitely checking out more of Mr. Resnick's books in the future.	2000-11-16

The art  is nothing compared to Bantock's.<br />The story could have been interesting but you're totally left hanging with no explanation at the end.<br />The Morocan atmosphere was a great setting and the writing wasn't bad but that can't make up for its short comings as a story.	2000-10-31
US	52778776	R266CAIWXR0BW2	0060273224	962868136	Sabriel (Old Kingdom)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Simple and original	I usually hate stories with teenage girls in them and at the ripe old age of 30 I tend not to like fantasy on the lighter side of things.  I loved this book!  I didn't know it was for young adults when I started and I still don't see why it's labelled as that.  Sabriel battles undead monsters (walking corpses, huge flaming demons etc...) throughout, children are killed and sold to undead creatures, people are sacrificed and there blood is used for dark rituals - that all sounds kind of adult to me, but I'm not complaining, some of those are the reasons I liked it so much.<br />The writing style is very simple, without pages full of description, but at the same time it doesn't seem underdone or choppy.  The world history seems to be well thought out and I love the ideas about magic and the realm of death.  The only complaint I have (and it's a small one) is that most of the problems that came up weren't solved creatively but instead outside help showed up or Sabriel suddenly remembered a spell for just that situation.<br />Great book I'll be looking for those sequels.	2000-10-29

McBain is funny and good at putting together comical situations.  It started out really funny but then got serious.  Not much shooting or car chases, so if that's what you're looking for look elsewhere.  This is very realistic cop drama, with McBain showing off his research from time to time, in relation to forensics, safe cracking, and burglary.	2000-10-12

But like another reviewer said, no real conclusions, more like story fragments.  His quirky style is great, he just needs more room to develop it.	2000-10-12

The characters were very unlikable.  Golan was a child hating old grump and Bliss almost broke down in tears every time she stepped on a blade of grass.  The same arguments over and over, no action and then he had to throw in a sex, like it's mandatory for the hero to sleep with at least one woman per planet visited or something.  Yuck!  This and _Prelude to Foundation_ should have never been written or at least cut down to a reasonable size.  Each book could have dropped about 150 pages with absolutely no effect on the plot.  If you really want to find out what happens, do the abridged version on tape and save yourself from this trash.	2000-10-04

Obviously the book is written in Bantock's style, (which is okay with me, I think more books should be written in this style), but the surrealist paintings are also very generic, with no originality.  I don't believe things like flying fish and people with bird heads are really a correct representation of dreams in general.  Most people's (even artists) dreams are not that 'out there', mostly dealing with transference of characters or locations, suspension of the laws of nature, and perception 'bending'.  I thought he handled the non-linear time well, it was confusing as it should be.<br />More plot would have been nice and less pictures of skinny naked women.  I'm heterosexual and I don't have a problem with nudity, but I tend to find women under 150 lbs fairly grotesque with their clothes off, so I found myself turning pages fairly quickly.  I couldn't help but get the feeling that the author used the book as an excuse to get every female friend he had, to take her clothes off  'for the cause of art'.<br />I think there's potential in Crimmins, he just needs to find a style more his own.	2000-10-01

I like the writing style and the whole thing is very original but after _Vurt_ this was definitely disappointing. The characters were not as much fun as _Vurt_, the scenes weren't as cool as _Vurt_. I would have liked it a lot more if it was about 100 pages shorter. It just dragged and even at the end I didn't get excited, although the comical version of Charon was hilarious.<br />A warning to cyberpunkers that haven't read _Vurt_ there really is no 'science' involved in this 'cyberpunck' novel. It really is more like a modern fantasy - no computers and no technobable.<br />If you like his style a lot try it, if you're not impressed with his prose leave it on the shelf.	2000-09-26

Just the fact that I could find a story about the Swamp Thing enjoyable is pretty amazing but Moore pulled it off.  I wasn't even that disturbed by the appearance of other caped-crusaders.<br />Here's what I didn't like: 1) That the plot line was kind of separated into 2 shorter 'themes'. 2) A thread started at the end that is not concluded in the book. 3) A monster that feeds on fear is just not all that original anymore.<br />But remember even with all that I gave it 4 stars.	2000-09-21

I loved _The Martian Chronicles_, _The Illustrated Man_, and  even _Dandelion Wine_ but I really hated this.  It reads like a poetic  history lesson for 3rd graders.  There were no big surprises, no new ideas,  just Halloween investigated one culture at a time by kids.<br /><br />Read it if  you're under the age of 10 when it could still be captivating or if you have  no idea about the history of Halloween and enjoy stories with young kids as  the main characters.	2000-09-20

This isn't your average find the murderer novel.  There's  a bunch of stuff going on and all of it is illegal.  Though not as dark as  _Death of a King_ (another medieval mystery from P.C.

The setting for the Dune world, with all its factions, and mix of  jedi-type magic and politics is probably the most exciting, interesting,  and marvelous setting I've ever read about.  So how could this book be so  bad?<br />There is almost NO action and an immense amount of dialogue.  At  times I believe Herbert was just talking to himself, amazing himself at how  clever he could be.<br />It's everybody against the 'God Emperor' but how do  you defeat someone that knows the future?  Obviously Herbert couldn't  figure it out either because he had to make Leto II purposely dense and  uncaring so that everyone would have a chance.<br />I loved the first 3 and  still plan on reading the last 2 but they HAVE to get better.  If you can  find an abridged version of this book read it just to keep up with the  story line.	2000-08-22

My adivce would be to read the stories  by  Longyear (Best), Yolen (great), Wrede (good) and then forget about the  rest.  The funny thing is that the stories I hated the most were by the  biggest name authors Brust and Wolfe.  Most of the stories were like  reading a single chapter out of a 'pulpish' fantasy novel.  The characters  attempted to be clever, there was a (simple) problem and it was solved  (unoriginally).  This is kind of what I remember the first Theive's World  being like (about 15 years ago).  If you like that kind of thing go for it,  but I won't be hunting down the rest of this series.	2000-08-18

The characters in Europe where too real.  I enjoyed the caricaturish Salterton  characters much better.  This book does seem to have a bit more of a plot  than the first two but I'm not sure Davies is that worried about plot in  his books.

US	52778776	R24CPWX3OY4OW3	0449912558	541384114	The Sparrow: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Sci-fi that reads like normal fiction	It's not the norm for a sci-fi novel to have this much characterization but it's a trend I would like to see followed by other authors.  The only  problem was that all the characterization left little room for the story.  If you're looking for a space opera or even for hard sci-fi I would say  this is not the place to look.  It took a long time for the characters to  get to the planet and when they did, they didn't really do much exploring  and had only minimal contact with one of the more interesting races of  aliens.<br />Here's my biggest problem with the novel.  From the beginning you  know that everyone dies except for Emilo (no problem) and then for 300+  pages Mrs. Russell builds up the characters, supposably so when they die it  will strongly affect the reader.  THEN she tells of their deaths in this  non-detailed second-hand account that totally loses all the feeling.  I  expected to be crying while reading about these people dying but instead it  was more like a minor detail.  It could have been the MOST dramatic scene  in the entire book but instead it was only an aside.  It was still a great  book, but it could have been unforgettable...	2000-08-17

I do agree with one (only one?) low rater that the really  long letters and journal entries were a bit unrealistic but I liked the  format a lot, so I overlooked that bit of unreality.	2000-08-17

It's really funny and his prose just seems  to flow.  It's not beautiful writing or profound but just reads easily.  I  thought he should have used more Lovecraftian (overblown for some people)  prose in normal situations just to be funny.	2000-08-17

Mickey Sabbath was so real that even his status as an absolutely moral-less anti-hero couldn't push me far enough away not to feel sorry for him as the story went on.  Reading this book made me want to go out and do something totally  outrageous just to feel more alive.<br />I agree with many of the other  reviewers.<br />David Duke (the narrator of the audio book) did a superb job  with accents, emotions and even sexual noises (although I wish he would  have done the gorilla noises toward the end).<br />The sex was too  analytical to be erotic in most cases (which is good if you happen to be  standing in line at the post office listening to it on tape).  I do have to  admit I fast forwarded through one of the scenes I found particularly  disgusting and I wish I would have fast forwarded through another one of  the scenes.	2000-07-01

I didn't care about the characters, I felt I knew exactlywhat was going to happen, and I was just plain bored.<br />The book is a mix of hard medical science and vampire myths.  There is no sensuality to these vampires so if your an Anne Rice fan don't even think about it.  Also be warned that some of the interludes/dreams of Vlad Teppish are EXTREMELY graphic and disturbing.  I usually don't mind things like this too much but it just wasn't needed in this case.<br />The only people I can think of that would like this book would be hardcore medical thriller readers that are looking for a bit of the fantastical.	2000-06-12

I've liked a couple short stories by this author quite a bit but I couldn't finish this book (I did get more than halfway through by forcing myself).<br />Most stories are either serious or funny and this story was  neither.  I found the characters very uninteresting, especially the main  character who seems to have some sense of honor but could just be called  &quot;Generic Witless Good Guy With Special Powers He Has No Idea How To  Use&quot;.<br />The final thing that stopped me reading the book was the bad  pun on the family names of :Locke, Bolte, Seale, and Keye.<br />I would say if  you're looking for a serious ghost story or story about the supernatural,  DO NOT read this book.  If you're looking for a funny ghost story DO NOT  read this book.  Actually I'm not sure why anyone would want to read this  tepid, urban fantasy.	2000-06-11

Lots of: Magic (creatures, gods, spells)<br />Sex (mostly sexual references and jokes)<br />Food (described in minute detail that will leave you drooling  even if you read it 5 minutes after Thanksgiving dinner)<br />Very funny and  original, my only 2 complaints are that there are too many characters and  some of their names are simillar like Rinaldo and Roberto, kind of  confusing; and it has a liteness about it like if you took out the sex it  could be a children's book.	2000-05-29

Every story was really good with the exception of the title story, _Nightflyers_, which was  absolutely fabulous and is now one of my favorite sci-fi stories.  All the  stories have a dark element of horror or creepiness.  You have spirit  possessed spaceships, corpses being animated and used for manual labor,  aliens hosting on humans in the guise of gods, etc...<br />This is not hard  sci-fi, which is exactly why I like it.  The horror/sci-fi mix reminds me  of the first _Alien_ movie and of _Event Horizon_.	2000-04-21

Jubal Harshaw was brilliant but after a while he just became a tool to preach Heinlein's philosophies.  Even though I agreed with most of what the author said, I  don't like to be preached at and especially when it's disguised as a story.	2000-03-18

The plot was totally environment based so fairly original, but there just didn't seem to be enough of it.  It could have used about 100 more pages and a couple  sub-plots.  This is actually the last book in _The Patternist_ series but  her first published novel.	2000-03-17

If you're looking for a quick read or action, shop elsewhere.  It's almost unbelieveable that something that twists language so much could translate so well.  He's a genius and my opinion of  his writing increases with every book I read by him. If you liked this try  _The Investigation_.	2000-03-17

This book, _The Investigation_ is not sci-fi at all, it's a mystery.  But true to Lem's style it is like no other mystery. You're never sure if the missing  corpses are actually getting up and walking away or if the whole thing is  just some epic scheme.  I loved it but I have to admit it's not for  everyone and not an easy read.	2000-03-17

The setting is very harsh (and I like that) but it seemed to me more like a string of events with no characters - all extras. I didn't care about the characters and they didn't  care about themselves.  There was no interaction.  These ideas put together  by someone like Iain Banks would be absolutely fabulous, but by himself it  needs work.	2000-03-01

I only let myself read a chapter at a time so that I wouldn't get excited and read the whole thing in one sitting.<br />It's a beautiful book, completely original (if it's not please e-mail me with it's precursor) and just the kind of  subject that I'm interested in.

I've had these books for about 10 year and never got to them until last  week - what a disappointment.  I have only read the first one so far but  it's off to a really bad start.  I don't like her writing style all that  much, it seems clunky and cumbersome at times and the main character was  not very likable.  The plot's fine with a couple of good surprises but the  end is a total cliffhanger - stopped right in the middle of a very  important scene.  I peeked ahead into the 2nd book and the scene is not  res	1999-11-01

This is probably the worst book I've read since 'Atlas Shrugged'.  I think he wrote it during commercials while watching TV.  The writing in the first  half was on par with most high school creative writing courses.  The plot  was very confusing and had a thrown together feel, like 'oh well, I'll  clean that up in the next book.'<br />The worst part is that he actually  sounded like he liked the story and thought it was good.	1999-11-01

Though it does get slow and frustrating at times, I found it very interesting and original.  It has all the elements of a dream - identity displacement, location displacement, time displacement and fantastic  unrealistic elements in abundance.  The answers to many questions are left  to be hypothesized about but this just adds to it's dream-like  qualities.<br />Brillant but not for everyone.	1999-06-13
