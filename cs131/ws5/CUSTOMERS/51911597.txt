For those who have read Crazy Ladies, she brings forward some of the characters while bringing onto the canvas a new generation.<br /><br />From the opening letter to a First Lady to the final pages of a wedding with a bonding of mother and daughter, this book held me and refused to let go.  As a reader I appreciate stories about all sorts of relationships and interactions.  This book did not disappoint. If you enjoy Southern style stories of strong women, you'll enjoy this book, too. Be aware though, that the men are not so likeable, save one or two.<br /><br />So break out some sweet tea, find yourself a cool spot, and be prepared to take the ride of your life. I promise you'll laugh and you'll cry and you'll be totally happy with this book.	2005-07-05
US	51911597	R29Y6JZ5MC0G5F	0066211115	10483428	Islands	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Good light read	The newest novel by this talented author takes place in the Low Country of South Carolina - Charleston and the islands of her shores.  While the plot is somewhat predictable, the descriptions are quite good.  I could \\"see\\" the scenes.  The dialogue moved the story along.  I was pulled in from the beginning and read the entire book in record time.<br /><br />This is a wonderful for an in front of the fire or by the pool type read.  It doesn't take much thinking power, but is enjoyable none the less. What I really like in a story is well defined characters who stay true throughout the book.  I found this with Islands.  I also enjoy strong relationships, which I also found with this read.<br /><br />Ms. Siddons' fans will surely enjoy this latest effort.  I would also recommend it to those who enjoy reading about the Low Country and beautiful, wealthy people with strong relationships. This was my first read by Ms Rivers Siddons and I enjoyed it as a good light read.	2005-06-30
US	51911597	R36UDWZ3UCI1TC	0066212715	948235800	Twilight	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Beautiful Twilight	This new book by talented author Katherine Mosby is poetic.  It was refreshing to read fiction with words that jump off the page, demanding the reader get a dictionary if the meaning is not known. The story is told with such descriptive prose; the characters so well developed, that it all seems real. Lavinia could have been your great aunt who lived in Paris, caught between two World Wars. She breaks her engagement giving up  her chance for a marriage because it would be loveless.  When she does find love, she learns that it hurts as much as it brings joy. Written with such intricate elegance, this book is quite simply, enchanting.  The two things that sometimes didn't work for me is that I had to pick up that dictionary a little too often and her sentences got so long that I forgot what her original point was! One was nearly eight lines long! She dealt with sexuality in a straightforward manner and there was no bad language.  However, I'll post the warning that if you have a problem reading about adulterous affairs, you may not wish to read this book. I loved the book myself. You can bet I'll be looking up her past titles to read more of her work.	2005-05-31

She proposes by searching our soul, our creativity improves, freeing us.<br /><br />Each chapter shows the reader how Oriah came to these things herself.  At the end there are three types of exercises. There is thinking, how, and doing.  Some of these I have seen in other books on writing, but the author acknowledges each of us has our own path to unfolding our souls.  By doing so, we are able to delve deep within, create, and share.<br /><br />I really would have loved to give this book the top rating, but I couldn't.  To be honest, I felt the author spent too much time discussing her own journey into searching for what she aches for rather than concentrating on helping the reader discover their own way.  As a reader if you are wanting a spiritual book on how creative work unfolds the soul - as the title implies - you may wish to look elsewhere.  On the other hand, if you are looking for ways to think and work on your creativity to accomplish goals, this might be the book for you and I recommend it highly.	2005-04-07
US	51911597	R3Q3LBNVKJB5AY	0060740566	330802959	A High and Hidden Place: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Hauntingly Beautiful	A High and Hidden Place is a must read by a talented new novelist Michele Claire Lucas.  The story is a fresh one. It tells the story of a small village in France that Nazis kill every citizen and destroy every building.  There is only a handful who survived this horrid act. The main character is one of the survivors, but was a child and has lost all memory of the event until she starts having flashbacks. Because of this, she goes on a search to find the truth of who she is. The characters are real and their dialogue moves the story along nicely.  As difficult as parts of the story are to read, the events depicted actually happened and it is important for us to remember.  It had me doing searches for the area involved.  What I found is the town remains the same today as when it was destroyed in 1944. Ms Lucas has named some of the characters the same as those who went through the destruction of the town.  The story could have been quite depressing, but the ending is filled with a lot of hope. I learned some history I had not known and what I read made me cry. It also seems to be a lesson for today, too.  There is plain evil in the world - and it has nothing to do with religion, but more the lack of a belief.  The final chapter was the most important to me, personally, especially the favorite prayer of Sophie's mother.  I for one, hope this is the first of many novels by Ms Lucas.	2005-03-01

As always, this is so much more than just a wall calendar with beautiful Victorian pictures.<br /><br />*There is a Day Book that fits into a lot of day planners or purses. Since it just lists the days, I use it for a \\"birthday/special days\\" book.  I also give extras as gifts to those I know enjoy Victorian era items.<br /><br />*Then there is a standup calendar showing the entire year at once. I always kept that at my work station. I receive many compliments throughout the year on how unique it is.<br /><br />*If that were not enough, included are four postcards that are suitable for framing, if you choose to not mail them.<br /><br />If you like Victorian, should you buy this, you will get one year after year. Most likely you'll want one for yourself and another to give as a gift to your Victorian lover or Cynthia Hart fan friends.  I can't recommend it enough. I save mine each year and use the lovely photographs for crafts such as altered items or frame and have given some as gifts.<br /><br />As in past years, Ms Hart has another hit with this lovely gift packaged calendar.	2004-11-03

Reading this cookbook from cover to cover was a pleasure. It reads like a family history. For any Emeril fan, his descriptions and tips read just as he talks.  As to be expected, he also uses onions, bell pepper, and garlic in nearly all his recipes.  Many of these we have seen before in various cookbooks, but Emeril updates them, adding his own flair, thus making the new versions seem fresh.<br /><br />What works for me about this particular cookbook:<br /><br />  *All the handy tips that are given about various food items<br /><br />  *If an item is difficult to find, a substitute is given - and there aren't many of these.<br /><br />  *The majority of the recipes are ones that can be used in my own kitchen<br /><br />  *All seasons are covered<br /><br />What doesn't work for me is one thing only.  As much as I like Emeril,  I would really have liked to have seen more pictures of the finished dishes rather than all of them be him.<br /><br />As a collector of cookbooks, this is my first one by Emeril, but it certainly won't be my last!  Great job.	2004-10-14

When they show you anything from a layout to a technique, they always have clear instructions in how to accomplish it.  Some of the more popular books, magazines, etc. spend more time in telling which products are used and not how to use the items to create.<br /><br />This book is beautifully photographed and contains updated uses for most tools you may have or intend to buy. All of the instructions are clear and accurate.  Granted, I have been scrapping for about a year and some of this may not be as fresh and new to long timers as it is to me.  Still, because of the reasons I mentioned, I believe this one deserves the 5 stars for rating.<br /><br />It is obvious that the authors of the articles contained within this book know their stuff.	2004-09-11

There, she is barely mentioned. The author weaving this story gives a lot more meaning for me.<br />The style of the writing is something I liked a lot. The story moved along and the relationships were easily understood. When I read the same names in Genesis, I had problems keeping everyone straight. Not so with the book.<br />For me, seeing how cultures and areas treated women differently, was fascinating. It would seem that even in ancient times, some were much more progressive than others. In Dinah's tribe, although women were honored and revered, they were still kept separate. Yet in neighboring tribes/areas women were treated with indifference or not to be thought of at all. I found this to be much the same as today. It brought to mind how women in different cultures are allowed freedom and in others, their lot remains the same as thousand of years ago.<br />Dinah's father Jacob seemed to not pay much attention to Dinah at all. It was almost as if he didn't know what to make of her, so ignored her instead. I felt his reaction to her husband was because he thought of her more as property than as his blood.<br />I would rate this book at 4 1/2 stars - between very good and excellent. I would recommend it to be read - but mostly to my female friends. I feel the writing flows and the relationships between all the women make this a particularly good read.	2004-05-06

I always have two extra copies on hand to give to my friends who may be experiencing a divorce or a death of a loved one.  My own copy is highlighted and worn.<br />I first read this book when a friend gave me a copy several weeks after my ex-husband left me.  I made some &quot;flash cards&quot; from especially moving sections. I would read them over and over during the two years it took for the divorce to be finalized.  Amazingly it really helped me let go of a lot of anger and help regain lost self esteem.<br />The next time I read the book was after my mother died. She had been sick for awhile and her death wasn't a surprise. But after being her caregiver for several years, I felt so lost and useless.  Reading Terry's words helped me through the pain once more move forward and begin life again feeling better about myself.<br />When a book influences you not once, but twice in your life the way this one has me, it makes finding adequate words of praise nearly impossible.  That said, if you have suffered any kind of loss at all, read this wonderful book. I know I feel blessed that my friend thought enough of me to share it.	2004-02-22

I had the wonderful opportunity of previewing the newest book from this very talented author.<br />It is about a Jewish teenager growing up in Brooklyn in the 70's. It touches on her relationship with her single parent mother and the mother's friends, the grandparents of the father she never knew, her friends at school, and several of her teachers. I really enjoyed it, but these are the kinds of stories I like. There is humor, sadness, betrayal, growing, etc. Things aren't always perfect and happily ever after, but rather realistic endings. Mariam and Valentine are well defined characters that will stay with you after you turn the last page.<br />There were some twists and turns and along with the humor and wisdom, it was dark in some places. As in life, there are some not-so-nice characters and their less than sterling behavior.  All in all a good read for those who enjoy mother/daughter and relationship books that are more true to life than sugary sweet.	2004-02-03

I didn't particularly care for this book.  Sadly I was really disappointed with his words. I had put this book on my wish list for the holidays and was fortunate enough to receive it. I read it. I let it sit. I read it again.  My opinion didn't change.  He has always seemed so straightforward, yet by his own words, he contradicts himself in his book.  We are of the same generation - actually very near each other in age - and I particularly didn't care for his generalization of boomer experience.  I really felt he was above such things, but he proved that wrong in this book.  I hope to goodness not all of my generation - especially those who actually enlisted and ended up in a war zone, rather than finding an alternative - are lumped together with Mr. Matthews.  The book is good reading for his fans who believe every single thing he says, but for those who were looking for deeper opinion, it is sorely lacking.	2003-07-23

While I don't consider it a keeper - in fact most likely I shall give it away - it was a nice, quick read.  Great for the summertime/beach type story.<br />The setting is North Carolina and the generational story is the kind that I like.  I do believe it bogs down a little and I was able to tell where it was going before it ended.  Otherwise I would have added the fifth star.<br />Hinton writes in a style that I enjoy. Though the voices of each character seemed realistic, I felt she did use some sterotypical descriptions/actions.  I would read more of her books in the future.	2003-07-23

Roberts knows the city, the area, and the people well. Born and raised in NE Ohio, I really appreciated his descriptions and how true to life the characters are.  My heritage is close to that of Milan and I understood the thinking of those from the old country and how they adapted to their new home.  As another reviewer stated - old hates and secrets take a long time to heal - often generations.<br />The book is fast paced and the mystery carefully plotted.  I think most mystery fans would enjoy this one - from NE Ohio or not.	2003-07-19

I can hardly wait to read the sequel that is now out.  Although it is catagorized as YA/teen, I found it a marvelous read.  It is one of the better written books I have read in awhile.  Too bad this kind of writing wasn't available when I was a youth.  The voice of each of the four girls is unique and lets the reader inside. The girls experience life on their own for the first time.  The pants are the link to their friendships.  Each brings something unique to the group. A great coming of age book that I believe is more realistic to the majority than not. A fresh approach by a fresh storyteller.  I do believe most readers from 12 on will enjoy this book.	2003-07-18

Very few books were written to give those who care for loved ones places to find answers. Most available books concentrated on specific conditions and the patients. Also at the time, the web didn't have the helpful, informative sites of today.  Personally, I would love to see Mrs. Carter update the book to include the email adresses and web sites for the sources listed.<br />My mother had been having a series of TIA's when I found this book.  Several months later she had a full fledged stroke.  I was her main caregiver until she required full time skilled care outside the home. When she was hospitalized and then in a nursing home setting, I continued to be her medical surrogate. As such,  I found this book not only a wealth of information, but also a great inspiration.  Much of the encouragement and advice given, falls in line with the Hospice literature I received in the final month of my mother's life. It is important for caregivers to understand there are places to receive help to let them care for themselves besides the patient. It can all be so overwhelming to try to do it all and so unnecessary to be alone.  Beyond that, the book helps to educate to be able to ask questions about medical, social, emotional, and economic issues to insure the best quality care.<br />This volume is filled with love and respect and I cannot recommend it enough. I even donated a copy to our local library.	2003-02-12

His description of the area is very accurate. One can visit many of the places mentioned - Volusia County, Palatka, St. Augustine - all have places mentioned in the book that are still very much in use.<br />It is the end of the Civil War.  The cattle needs to be moved to help feed the Confederacy. The challenges of doing so makes for interesting reading. Some of the area described has changed very little.  Granted, power poles and lines grow next to major paved highways. However, many roads are still sand. There are still swamps and forests.  We who live in this area like to think of it as the \\"real\\" Florida.  The union officers housed in Palatka and St. Augustine are met with a hostile hospitality. These events did happen and Mr. Tonyan has written them beautifully.<br />As another reviewer has said - try to meet the author. He has more stories to tell.	2003-01-15

This is one of those instances.<br />This was the choice for my book club.  Right from the get-go I had problems with the way the author writes the dialogue.  I guess that should have been a clue as to what was up, but I missed it.  It was just irritating.<br />The there was all the coincidences in Linda and Thomas meeting at various times.<br />I hate when someone tells too much of the story in a review, so I won't go into too much.  I shall say this - the author let me down as a reader.  What she does at the end, she may feel is a new &quot;gimmick&quot;, but it has made me determined to not read another of her books.<br />If you are so inclined to read this, or as in my case it is your book club's selection, I would suggest checking it out at the library.

She has such a beauty about her,  regardless of size.  Her book tells about her life and struggles to meet everyone else's expectations. She didn't become comfortable with herself until she learned to accept herself for who she is. The first part of the book is dedicated to that search. I laughed and I cried along with her.  To me, it took a lot for her to tell this story. I am not into the tabloids nor tabloid tv programming.  I would much rather read about these things from the people involved.<br />She gives a lot of beauty advice and style advice in the second part. I did not always find her home formulas to be the best. Her tips, on style, however, I really enjoyed.<br />The thrid part, is a resource section that gives a lot of web sites. I really enjoyed surfing the sites listed.<br />The pictures of her family and throughout her career were enjoyable to me.  Some of us can relate to these people and places.  They are throughout the entire book.<br />Delta's way should be the way for all of us.  Just be who we are, love ourselves for that, and let our inner beauty shine through.

Katherine and Ian's story is one that stays with you a long time.  You care about these two.  You want them to be together from the start. The characters are well defined, the plot is not filled with cliches.  I really cared what happened to these two. It is obvious they are the love of each other's life. Even the secondary characters are so well defined as to add to the story itself, not just &quot;pad&quot; it.  The fact that I love the British Isles for settings in my books helps, too! *smile*  The romance, suspense, time travel, it all goes to make this one you shouldn't miss.  Ms Davis is a new star on the horizon and I look forward to reading more of her books.	2002-02-14

The ladies who are the writing team are talented storytellers. Merrill and Jason are such a wonderful fun couple with all the usual lust at first site, but I am NOT getting involved!  But of course they do - with some most unlikely sort of help. The antics of Cupid and Venus just had me rolling with laughter the entire time.  I could just picture Jupiter laying down the law.<br />There is good character developement, along with new plot twists that move the action right along.  All that and humor, too, will keep you right there until the last page.<br />Thank you ladies, for the delightful story.  Don't miss it, if you like a light, humorous read.	2002-02-14

I truly enjoyed Raina and Al-Mon's story. These characters are so well defined that you care what happens to them from the moment they meet.  The secondary characters are also very, very good - especially her collegues and his parents. I love time travel and the plot in this one is different than most. I enjoyed that it kept pace in one particular period after the beginning. It certainly is fast paced and keeps you turning page after page until the surprise ending.<br />Ms Snodgrass is a gifted storyteller and I hope she continues with time travel romances.  If you are a fan of the genre, you won't be sorry if you try this one.  I think it is a keeper.	2002-02-14
US	51911597	RJ8KIGYHEVY3V	0671041746	169462363	Daughter of Destiny (Sonnet Books)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Intiguing romance	This was the first book that I read by Ms Fobes.  It was different than most of the romances I chose. I enjoy time travel and &quot;different&quot;, but had never really read anything quite so mystical. The characters are very well defined and the plot moves along quite quickly in most cases.  Georgina and Brock have a lot of obsticales in their way and how they come thru is unique.  They are characters that the reader cares about right from page one.<br />The Durids involved in the basically regency type novel, are a touch that give the book the added special quality.  I really could not predict some of the twists and turns - which helped hold my attention.<br />Yes, this was the first, but not the last for me by this gifted and talented storyteller.	2002-02-14

But I also take it in a slightly different way than some of the other reviewers.  I have never &quot;read&quot; it as a total book.  I have taken it a section at a time by how my moods are or where I am in my life.  These books have made a difference to the authors during different periods of their lives.  Hopefully they can for someone else, too.  I really wish a book like this had been around when I was a teenager to give me a good head's up start.  I keep it with my reference books and turn to it time and again. Sure, I have read a number of the books already, but it is great to know I have good company.  Besides, there were a few I had forgotten and returned to them for a good read.  Or I even used &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; as a starting place to continue learning more about Anne and her writings, as example. Some authors I checked for more of their work.  For the previous reviewer who complained about the &quot;girls&quot; aspect and the authors being middle-aged or as old as her mother ......... women can be &quot;girls&quot; at any age ... it is all in the attitude, girlfriend. ;-)	2002-02-07
US	51911597	R35RKDBW4PR4UT	0446326925	466382943	Wild Orchids	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Fun read	I read this book when it was first published in the mid 80's.  I just loved it.  I felt it flowed much smoother than &quot;To Love a Man&quot; - Ms Robard's first contemporary after many historicals. Max and Lora were a good match in my mind. I like my romance reads to &quot;take me away&quot; and be escapism from a hectic schedule. This did the trick, especially at the time I read it. In my mind it is for the beach or a plane ride, etc.  It was a keeper and I still enjoy the read when I revisited it every two years or so.	2002-01-28

There are 8 different note cards on one side and a book with quotes about tea on the other.  I have gotten several of these to give as gifts and to use as door prizes at events.  I also have had several for myself.  Why would I need more than one?  I have used the cards as invitations to teas, then have given the books as a gift to one of the guests.  I keep one on hand at all times, never knowing when I may decide to hostess another tea.  Actually, the cards are lovely enough to frame and I keep thinking ....... one day!  *sigh*  If you are looking for recipes, this isn't it.  If you just love the idea of beautiful paintings and gracious words, this is it!  Or remember the tea lover on your gift lists.	2002-01-27

That is how I came to pick up this read.  I am not sorry that I did so.  Ms Maron developes her characters so well that the reader cares what happens to them.  Granted, her writing is light and easy to finish, however sometimes this escape is what is needed.  After reading &quot;Loons&quot;, I went on to other books in this series.  I have yet to be disappointed in the author's writing.	2002-01-25
US	51911597	R3TOBIKPU5JC9T	0061041807	882544335	Finger Prints	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Romance for the heart	I read this book when it was first published in the late 80's.  This was one of Ms Delinsky's first longer stories.  I have enjoyed her writing from her Harlequins on thru to today.  She was one of those you knew had a shining future.  In this story Carly sees a crime and knows too much.  She is relocated with a new identity.  When Ryan shows great interest in her, she is very wary.  Though she is greatly attracted to him, she doesn't know whether or not to trust her heart.  Though one could say the story is still formula, the characters are well developed and the reader really cares what happens to them.  This is a romance well worth your time.	2002-01-21

I first read this book when it was published as a Loveswept title in the late 80's.  The story has stayed with me and I usually read it during flights or long appointment stays, etc. I can no longer find my original copy.  Elizabeth owns a wonderful shop called Fantasy.  Her sister (whose story follows in &quot;Adam's Fall) always tries to get her to lighten up - even getting her a vanity license plate.  I really do not want to give too much of the plot away, but it is a fast and fun read.  Ms Brown has come a long way from her formula days, but for a good short story, this one is great.	2002-01-21

It really sounded like it had promise, which I am sure is why a friend bought it for me. Two people running away from their marriages die in a plane crash. How would the surviving spouses react to their affair? I like romance and all. But, I could barely finish it.  What a waste!<br />How many ways can someone find to say &quot;I love you&quot; within 5 pages???  This was so trite, with so little character developement I cannot even recall the characters' names.  But then why would I even want to do so?  There are very few books that I have read that I could not find something in them to like.  This was one.	2002-01-18

Allison and Bill are so real.  Their story is filled with humor, thoughtfulness, misconceptions, murder, mystery, etc.  It has it all.  The secondary characters are well written, too.  Allison's ex is Doug.  My ex is Doug.  I could relate!  I enjoyed Allison's daughter, her coworkers, Bill's family and co-workers. Even those who worked for or were clients of the homeless shelter rang true.  Thank you, Sally for another wonderful story.	2002-01-16

This one is so filled with mystery and suspense, I believe any mystery or romance lover will enjoy it.  The main characters are well defined and the plot twists keep you turning page after page after page. Ms Steward is so gifted, I hope she continues these types of stories for years to come.	2002-01-09

Ms Hart's calendar has been my fav over the past 8 years.  But this is so much more than just a wall calendar with beautiful Victorian pictures.  THere is a Day Book that fits into a lot of day planners or purses. Since it just lists the days, I use it for a &quot;birthday/special days&quot; book.  Then there is a standup calendar showing the entire year at once.  I always kept that at my work station.  If that were not enough, included are four postcards that are suitable for framing. If you like Victorian, should you buy this, you will get one year after year.	2001-12-26

But since going to England, it has become an even bigger must have for me.  The recipes are as authentic as I have seen.  We stayed at a B&amp;B and she used ones nearly identical - at least I couldn't tell by the taste that there was a difference!  We also had tea at Sally Lunn's and the recipes from there are truly right on. I am so glad I had this before I visited. Now I would be &quot;lost&quot; without it.  A must have for anyone who loves tea!	2001-12-20

But this one I am not too sure about.  The main character's name of Douglass was a little confusing at times.  She whines. Women are treated badly in parts.  Not that women aren't treated badly for real ....  I just prefer stronger ladies.  The whole thing was lacking...... something.	2001-12-20

I enjoy Ms Maron's style of writing, so that didn't matter. The cast of characters is quirky and the art world was a far cry from the southern family style of the Knott mysteries. Over all I had fun with it and learned a thing or two.	2001-12-16

Since this soap was taken from us on the 35th anniversary, this book has even more meaning. You will get to relive the highlights and story lines now missing from our daily lives.  I get mine out about every 6 months - or whenever I need a Bay City fix. Looking through the book always manages to bring tears or laughter to me.	2001-07-22
