Lewis' THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH is nominally the third book in what is described as his \\"space trilogy,\\" but such a description does not accurately portray the nature of this prophetic work.  Lewis himself calls it \\"a modern fairy-tale for grown-ups,\\" but that also falls short of adequate description.  Since science fiction it is not, and a fairy tale it is not, let us see if we can determine what it may be.<br /><br />It is, of course, allegorical and suggests strongly the same sort of allegory that underlies the Ring series by Tolkien (despite the latter's statements to the contrary).  As the scientific research organization N.I.C.E. steadily gains public acceptance, then public support, and then assumption of governmental authority, even as the nefarious nature of its goals becomes more and more evident, the reader struggles to scream a warning to the citizens being caught and enslaved in its encroaching web.  Why do they not see through the façade of scientific progress and recognize the dehumanizing goals of this soulless entity?  Why do they support this encroaching social cancer?  Why do they turn against and attack those few who try to sound a warning?  The reader, who has the advantage of an external vantage point, sees the growing evil, the destruction of that which is good, but is powerless to open the eyes of those who are being irretrievably deceived.<br /><br />Lewis' allegory is, unfortunately, timeless and is as applicable today as it was when it was first published in 1945.  It is no stretch of the imagination to equate N.I.C.E. with the spreading multi-national corporations of the 21st century.  As president of the United States from 1953 to 1961, Dwight Eisenhower warned of the social and economic dangers inherent in the growing military-industrial complex, but his prescience has been disregarded, or, more sinisterly, has been overwhelmed by the strength of industrialists whose wealth and power seem to place them above control by the people.  Yet, had Lewis' warning been heeded in 1945, Eisenhower's would have been unneeded ten years later.  Both are still applicable today.<br /><br />Is there a solution to the encroachment of evil into human affairs?  If there is, Lewis did not know of it. True, by the end of THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH, the tools of evil are dead and the N.I.C.E. organization is destroyed, but Lewis warns that this has been only a battle and that the war will continue in other places and in other ways.<br /><br />Lewis' message is, as I hope I have now shown, as uncomfortably real, urgent, and contemporary as it was when he wrote it.  As to the manner in which he wrote it, this book is surely the strongest and most readable of the trilogy, which includes OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET and PERELANDRA.  In fact, even though reading the trilogy in order will give the reader a better understanding of Ransom and how he came to be the \\"Director\\" of the \\"good guys,\\" this final book can easily stand alone and, if only one of the trilogy is to be read, would be my choice of the one to read.  The other two, while worthy of being read, are, at times, plodding in contrast to this one, which is guaranteed to raise the reader's inner tension and to urge him ever forward in the saga.<br /><br />If there is a weakness in the plot of this third book, it comes in the means of bringing down N.I.C.E., its minions, and its masters.  Readers familiar with Greek drama and its use of a \\"deus ex machina\\" to rescue hapless humans from their own foibles will see that Lewis has relied on a similar technique.  Literally, several intermediate gods (inspired by medieval concepts of hierarchical levels in the universe) as well as a reawakened Merlin and a biblical \\"Tower of Babel\\" solution are necessary to defeat the enemy in this battle, and I'm not at all certain that any of these weapons are available to us in the \\"real world.\\"  Despite this, however, the novel is as gripping as any conspiracy suspense thriller, a comparisonI have borrowed from another reviewer because I can think of no better way of putting it.  In short, buy the book, read it, and, most importantly, learn from it.  I have.mparison I have borrowed from another reviewer because I can think of no better way of putting it.

In GOD'S SECRET AGENTS, Alice Hogge sets forth a fascinating case that the plot by dissident Catholics, which was real enough, also provided the Anglican Protestant government with a marvelously effective propaganda tool with which to suppress English Catholicism in general and the Jesuit order in particular.<br /><br />  Queen Elizabeth had, despite occasional protestations to the contrary, shown herself generally willing to suppress those of her subjects who professed to follow the Catholic faith, except when her government viewed them as \\"cash cows,\\" fining them severely for failure to attend State-approved church services.  As for priests who ministered to practicing Catholics, arrest, hanging, disemboweling, and drawing and quartering lay just behind discovery by the government priest-hunters, the pursuivants.<br /><br />  In due course, Elizabeth dies and is succeeded by James, the Scottish king. Professing tolerance and seeking peace among his subjects, James nonetheless proves himself to be far more interested in reconciling the various Protestant factions than in extending the hand of tolerance to the papists in his kingdom.  (The King James Version of the Bible is unabashedly a Protestant translation.)  In their disappointment at James' failed assurances, several extremists stockpile gunpowder in a cellar under the House of Lords and are discovered only at the eleventh hour, leading, of course, to more hangings, disemboweling, etc.<br /><br />  This, in a nutshell, is the history covered by Hogge's book, but this summation scarcely hints at the incredibly fascinating journey through the telling of that history:  Plot and counter-plot.  Stealth.  Intrigue. Secret landings on the coast at night.  Disguises.  Government spies.  Deceit.  Concealed hiding places (\\"priest holes\\") artfully constructed in the walls, staircases and chimneys of houses.  Thundering blows at the door in the middle of the night as the pursuivants close in.  State-sponsored (and therefore legal) torture of suspected priests and their servants.  This history book is as much a \\"page turner\\" as any spy novel but with the added benefit of imparting factual knowledge to the reader.<br /><br />  Anyone interested in the culture and society of England in the decades leading up to and encompassing the creation of the King James Version of the Bible, which remains incredibly popular to this day, will be delighted by Hogge's book, although a measure of horror and disgust may attend some of her descriptions of the government's justice meted out to loyal citizens who had the misfortune of adhering to the \\"wrong\\" faith.  The reader who marries Hogge's GOD'S SECRET AGENTS to Allister McGrath's IN THE BEGINNING will beget an excellent picture of the forces that created contemporary English and American society, particularly as those societies are shaped (or warped) by religious movements.<br /><br />  GOD'S SECRET AGENTS is Alice Hogge's first book.

Lewis' Perelandra is sometimes described as a work of science fiction, but those who read it expecting to find a typical science fiction novel (if there is such a thing as a \\"typical\\" sf novel), are likely to be disappointedly surprised.  While the protagonist, Ransom, is indeed transported to the planet Perelandra, otherwise known as Venus, the book is much more one of Christian philosophy than it is of science fiction.  In fact, the entire story is an allegorical retelling of the Garden of Eden myth.<br /><br />The retelling does have a rather intriguing twist in that Ransom is sent to Perelandra to do battle with the evil tempter in an attempt to save this planet's \\"Eve\\" from succumbing to his seductions and thereby leading \\"Adam\\" to another biblical fall from grace.  This is a decently imaginative approach and affords Lewis copious opportunities to regale the reader with wonderful descriptions of the Perelandrian Garden of Eden.<br /><br />Inasmuch as the characters and assumptions are derived from Lewis' early 20th century Christian philosophy, the book contains several concepts that may be jarring to a more egalitarian 21st century reader.  For example, the Venusian \\"Adam\\" is referred to as the King, not as a deity but as the literal ruler of the planet, which assuredly exalts him above \\"Eve,\\" who is merely his Lady. In numerous passages, both \\"Adam\\" and \\"Eve\\"are described as superior to all the other animals on the planet, which must bow to their human supremacy.  Humans of Tellus, otherwise known as Earth, are, of course, all sinners as the result of their own failed Garden of Eden experiment.  The Evil One manifests himself in the body of Weston, a physicist whose empiricism rejects notions of religious beliefs. There are more examples, but the simple point is that Christian biblical stories, beliefs and assumptions underlie all of the characters, actions and assumptions in Lewis' novel.<br /><br />As usual, Lewis' use of language is superb, and his descriptive writing is worth studying for the edification of other would-be authors.  I did find two parts of the book somewhat annoying, however.  The first is the dialogue between Ransom and the Un-man, representative of evil, as the Un-man discusses Spirituality and \\"truth\\" from his perspective.  Try as I might, I could not follow the Un-man's argument and, indeed, Ransom himself says that he is not sure of the Un-man's meaning.  Perhaps Lewis has intentionally obfuscated the sense of the argument to indicate that arguments from such a source are fallacious and clouded.  The other part comes near the end, while the Eldila, which appear to be angelic entities, expound on the encompassing nature of God.  Their lengthy hyperbolic descriptions and analogies become quite tedious after a while.<br /><br />Would I recommend the book to a potential reader?  That depends entirely on the reader's motivation.  If it is to observe Lewis' generally fine writing skill and technique, then certainly I would recommend spending some time with Perelandra.  If one is interested in exploring an imaginative twist to an old story and seeing what the supposed outcome of an \\"unfallen\\" Adam and Eve might have been, then surely the book is worthwhile.  I would not recommend it for someone who is ignorant of Christian mythology, for many references and allusions would be missed without a background knowledge of the biblical story of Man's fall from Grace.  Certainly, I would not suggest it to anyone seeking a \\"real\\" science fiction novel, unless, of course, the reader were equally interested in a philosophical look at the nature of good and evil, innocence and sin, and beauty and ugliness, for this theme is paramount throughout Perelandra.  So far as the title I chose for these comments, if it intrigues you, then by all means read the book and think on the symbolic nature of the container that transports Ransom from Tellus to Perelandra and back again!his descriptive writing is worth studying for the edification of other would-be authors.

I had bought it more from a personal dare to myself than from a real desire to plunge into a rather dry treatise on physical evolution.  Publically buying a copy of Darwin's book was somewhat tantamount to flouting local morality in my southern Bible Belt community, and, as a young teenager, I was feeling rebellious.  I remember being surprised that the store even had the book!<br /><br />Contrasted with the tedious explanations in Darwin's seminal work, Dawkins' narrative in The Ancestor's Tale is positively delightful reading.  The author is nearly as good a wordsmith as he is a scientist.  His technique of designing his narrative along the lines of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is imaginative and catches the reader's fancy, and his occasional references to current political leaders and illiberal religious groups convey his knowledge of cultural and social trends as well as of the natural sciences.<br /><br />Still, interesting as it is, The Ancestor's Tale is not to be considered light reading.  Scientific taxonomy is not ignored, nor are descriptions of cellular structures and mechanics.  The reader is often called upon to remember those long-ago high school and college courses in biology in order to grasp the meaning of the text, and in a few cases, I felt fortunate to come away with what I thought was the gist of a paragraph, for I was certain that its full implications had eluded my comprehension.<br /><br />I did find the book to be a magnificent refresher of my fading knowledge of biological science, but, of even greater interest, I found that more than one belief encountered in my long-ago university courses has been replaced with more accurate interpretations of evolutionary events. For instance, I am utterly amazed to learn that the mitochondria, which are part and parcel of our living cells, were once independently living bacteria, and that another bacterium spins its flagellum in a ceaseless circular motion like the blades of a fan.  My antiquated concepts of evolution were based on the prevailing science of forty years ago, when the fossil record seems to have been our most reliable method of investigating evolutionary change.  Dawkins' book, on the other hand, details the evidence revealed by gene mapping, which is far more comprehensive and revealing than examination of the fossil record can ever be.<br /><br />By the way, Dawkins' observations on mitochondria and on the bacterium Rhizobium also cleared up a quite unrelated mystery for me.  Now I know the inspirational origins of the fictional \\"miticlorians\\" that are discussed in the motion picture \\"Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace\\" as well as the strange propulsion system that drives the ship carrying the Jedi knights and Jar Jar Binks through the core of the planet Naboo.  What fun revelations!<br /><br />I did find parts of Dawkins' book a bit of a climb, and I'm sure that bits of it even eluded my full comprehension here and there, but the view of evolutionary science when I finally reached the summit was well worth the effort to get there.

The book is essentially a collection of separate and independent tales recounting some of the author's adrenalin-raising adventures as a park ranger, so the reader is free to read the chapters in any order desired; none is really dependent upon any other for its meaning.  In fact, I believe that some of the chapters have appeared singly in various other publications before being collated into book form, so each is basically a \\"stand-alone\\" adventure.<br /><br />The fact that the events that now appear as chapters in a single volume were originally composed as separate and stand-alone stories does result in some annoying repetition, particularly as regards the training and technical qualifications of the author.  Readability would have been enhanced had such redundancies been edited out of the final book.<br /><br />There are also a few grammatical problems infesting the pages of \\"Park Ranger,\\" specifically agreement errors between pronouns and their antecedent nouns.  Sentences such as \\"When a patient tells me they are going to die, I believe them\\" appear far too frequently to be ignored.  Referring to a singular noun such as \\"patient\\" by plural pronouns such as \\"they\\" and \\"them\\" is a disturbing error that weakens the readability of the text.<br /><br />In brief, \\"Park Ranger\\" is a fairly entertaining series of adventures in a variety of situations that generally fall into the categories of first aid treatment, law enforcement, and fire fighting.  It is in the same genre as magazines such as \\"True Adventure\\"  with a touch of \\"Mickey Spillane\\" here and there.  If one is looking for serious information on Civil Service employment as a park ranger, this isn't it, nor will it satisfy anyone seeking an enduring literary experience.  On the other hand, several of the tales are rather engrossing, and reading them definitely outranks counting pine cones around the tent as evening entertainment!the tales are rather engrossing, and reading them definitely outranks counting pine cones around the tent as evening entertainment!	2005-07-30

Each author takes a somewhat different approach to his subject matter, and I find the three by no means redundant.  Rather, they help reenforce and clarify the historical facts that they share amongst themselves, and, to anyone interested in this topic, I recommend all three if time and motivation permit.  If not, then I suggest that McGrath's \\"In the Beginning\\" may provide the single most readable and comprehensive history of the group.<br /><br />Bobrick focuses his exploration on the persons whose contributions to the translation of the Bible into the vernacular have proved to be the most influential and memorable, and he presents them in chronological order: John Wycliff, William Tyndale, and Miles Coverdale, followed by one who, though not a translator himself, caused further translation to be made: King James, and concluding with the evolution of political and religious thought in England during the Commonwealth of Cromwell and the Glorious Revolution under William III.<br /><br />Why is Bobrick's book (and Nicolson's and McGrath's books as well) worth the time and effort to read? I suggest that one of the most compelling reasons is that many Britons and Americans revere and \\"believe in\\" the King James Version of the Bible without having any knowledge or understanding of the cultural, social and political forces that brought it into being or of its many predecessor bibles.  To quote George Bernard Shaw, cited in Bobrick, \\"To this day the common Britisher or citizen of the United States of North America accepts and worships it as a single book by a single author, the book being the Book of Books and the author being God.\\"  Only through the research and writings of historians such as Bobrick can we hope to counter such naivete with facts and historical truths, and is not the seeking of truth the ultimate goal of all education and self-improvement?<br /><br />The fascinating story of the political and linguistic history behind the English translations of the Bible, including the many burnings-at-the-stake that resulted from those translations, was not taught by my public high school or even university.  I am excited and pleased that Bobrick (and Nicolson and McGrath) have now given us books with which my fellow readers and I can educate ourselves and fill in some of the many gaps in our formal learning.seeking of truth the ultimate goal of all education and self-improvement? <br /> <br />The fascinating story of the political and linguistic history behind the English translations of the Bible, including the many burnings-at-the-stake that resulted from those translations, was not taught by my public high school or even university.

And thank goodness for the final chapter!  It satisfied at least a few  cravings by wrapping up a few loose ends that I feared were going to go unresolved.  Still, I'm left feeling that this is far from being McCaffrey's best novel of the Dragonrider genre.<br /><br />The novel suffers from a lack of cohesiveness and focus.  The reader is expected to view the world from too many different and not very closely related viewpoints.  The best developed of these viewpoints is Artist Iantine's, but then K'vin's pops up, then Chalkin's, then P'tero's and M'leng's, and let's not forget Debera's.  Since we ourselves are not in Pern, just whose eyes are we supposed to be using to view that planet and its inhabitants?<br /><br />This confusion of focus is exacerbated by many under-developed plot lines as well.  The predominant one focuses on Chalkin's ignorant and abusive mismanagement of his hold and its holders, but then he's impeached and banished, and literally vanishes from the story line.  We also find a clear sub-plot in the fast-growing romance between Iantine and Debera, a romance that is greatly complicated because of Debera's psychic attachment to her dragonet, but this line of thought ultimately goes nowhere and also vanishes from the story line before the end of the book.<br /><br />Need more examples?  How about the love between P'tero and M'leng?  The reader is all set to uncover socially responsible commentary on homosexual relationships between two perfectly honorable weyrmates, but the relationship never becomes a focus in the novel.  In fact, after the lions attack the two lovers, we seldom hear much of them again.  And what purpose does Weyrleader S'nan's recalcitrance serve other than to prolong several tedious conversations and debates about what actions the weyrs should take against Lord Holder Chalkin?<br /><br />About the only sub-plot that is actually resolved by the end of the book is the relationship between the weyrleaders K'vin and Zulaya, and even that is a rather simplistic resolution.  It turns out that all Zulaya really wants is to be dominated by an assertive male, which K'vin, being her junior by a decade, had not precisely exemplified up to the final chapter.<br /><br />Saving the most extravagant example of an unconnected sub-plot for the last example, let us now consider Clisser and his teachers at the College.  All of a sudden, after 250 years of humans living on Pern, Clisser has an epiphany.  The curriculum is not relevant!  We must change the entire subject matter as well as our mode of instruction, returning to the oral tradition of song to impart knowledge of Threadfall.  Additionally, we must resurrect variants of Stonehenge so that our descendants will recognize the imminence of Threadfall in yet another two and a half centuries.  And we are going to do all this while preparing to defend our planet against an imminent Threadfall of our own!  I'm afraid that Professor Clisser's priorities are just a bit unrealistic.<br /><br />So what the reader is left with is not even as well connected as a tangle of Thread dropping from the Red Planet: an abusive Lord Holder, several love affairs of various persuasions, a recalcitrant weyr leader, another Lord Holder (Jamson) with encroaching senility, and a College head who must revise the curriculum right this minute!  If all of these divergent plots were somehow united and related and intertwined in some sort of cause and effect scenario, McCaffrey might have produced a fine novel.  That, sadly, is not the case.

Refreshing in that this is science fiction from an innocent, one might even say naïve, age. Here we find no light sabers, no warp cores, no wormholes. Even the alien lifeforms are recognizable as having been inspired by an imagination steeped in the reality of earthly creatures or, at least, of earthly imaginations. If \\"Star Wars\\" takes us to the pinnacle of futuristic combat, then \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" takes us to a calmer milieu where sanity, reason, and compassion still exert major influence. I found the environment a relief from the high stress levels of most contemporary science fiction.<br /><br />Now, why is the book also thoroughly embarrassing?  First, understand that the sci-fi genre is merely a stage trapping, a setting in which a serious drama unfolds as the playwright directs.  The embarrassment is in the message of the drama.  Except for one rather annoying (and carnivorous) water creature, the alien races that one meets in Lewis' novel are far more civilized and rational than are two of the three humans plunked into their midst, and even the third affronts the alien culture through his irrational fear.  These representatives of the human race just do not comport themselves as one would like!<br /><br />Many critics intent on explicating Lewis' works see the heavy influence of Lewis' Christian philosophy at work, and, indeed, the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" do provide imaginative allegories for Christian beliefs.  I do not, however, find such heavy-handedness to be at work in \\"Out of the Silent Planet,\\" though there are some neat creatures that do remind one of fanciful angels. Approach \\"Silent Planet\\" expecting to re-discover science fiction as the genre began and don't expect heavy-duty allegorical figures or any sort of super-technology at work.<br /><br />Do, however, anticipate quite a bit of implied criticism of the human species--a criticism that the actions of Lewis' characters show may be well deserved!<br /><br />Oh, one final observation:  One of the absolute joys of this book is Lewis' fine command of the English language.

The new version currently in print is entitled 125 YEARS OF BLACK HILLS RAILROADING, and my review speaks to this revised and expanded version.<br /><br />  Because I have met Rick Mills and have spoken with him on several occasions, and because we share a common fascination with railroading and with the Black Hills of South Dakota, I hesitate to criticize any aspect of his latest book, 125 YEARS OF BLACK HILLS RAILROADING. It is so much easier to be critical of another's creative effort than it is to be equally creative oneself that I sometimes hesitate to critique any book at all. On the other hand, when a writer chooses to become a professional author by accepting remuneration for his creativity, then I suppose he is willingly accepting the spotlight of public criticism. I would not become such a professional author, for my ego would never withstand the critical beatings it would undoubtedly receive. With these confessions now aired, what are my reactions to Mills' new book?<br /><br />  First, the author's knowledge of his subject matter is nothing if not impressive. Mills knows his topic.  The breadth and depth of historical detail contained in this book are remarkable. Beyond that, the scope, clarity and quantity of the historical photographs reproduced throughout the book are without doubt worthy of the highest praise I can possibly lavish upon them. Most, of course, are in black and white, for the originals predate the advent of color photography.  Those of today's railroads in the Black Hills are in color.  The plethora of excellent photographs is surely the greatest contribution that the book makes to its subject of railroading in South Dakota over the past 1 ¼ centuries.<br /><br />  Having praised those aspects of the book that I feel deserve such plaudits, objectivity mandates that I now turn to other aspects that are not quite so pleasing, of which there are three.  First, much of the text is simply uninspiring.  The facts, figures and dates are all here, but they are not presented in scintillating sentences and inspiring paragraphs.  The pace is often plodding, and the human anecdotes that personalize such histories are far too few and infrequent.<br /><br />  Second, the usefulness of the text could have been greatly enhanced by inclusion of many more maps.  It is one thing to read that such and such a narrow gauge line was extended from this town to that mining camp and up that gulch, but it is far more comprehensible to see the spatial relationships of those towns, camps and gulches.  To a reader not intimately familiar with the historical (and occasionally no longer existing) place names in the Black Hills, the text in such cases is pretty meaningless.  Augmentation of such written descriptions with pertinent maps would have been a helpful addition.<br /><br />  Finally, I was perturbed to find several repetitive grammatical and punctuation errors in the text. Frequent confusion between the very different words \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" and \\"lead\\" and \\"led\\" suggests that the manuscript was not competently proofread. To my mind, this is a significant weakness in any book being professionally published and sold.  Readers deserve absolute grammatical accuracy for their money.<br /><br /> How, then, shall we rate this book?  Five stars for historical detail and superb photographic content.  Three stars for the inclusion of maps and the lack thereof.  Two stars for plodding text and inferior proofreading of grammatical structures.  Let's average it all out at three stars.<br /><br />  Who would enjoy this book, despite the parts with which I have found fault? I recommend it for everyone interested in the history of American railroading; in the cultural and economic evolution of the Dakotas, Nebraska and Wyoming; in marvelous historical photography; in the histories of the Chicago & Northwestern, the Milwaukee, or the Burlington railroads; or in the \\"boom and bust\\" nature of the mining industry of the Black Hills. The book deserves a spot in any collection of regional history of the American Midwest.the Chicago & Northwestern, the Milwaukee, or the Burlington railroads; or in the \\"boom and bust\\" nature of the mining industry of the Black Hills.

Most of the stories here run from two to six pages in length, and it is to Bradbury's credit that he packs almost every one with significance and meaning far beyond the scope of the story itself.  Here, the reader will find profound observations on the human condition, on the thin veneer of civilization that can be easily ripped asunder, on the human need for approbation, on the human need for love, on the human need for belief and spirituality, and on every other characteristic that makes one human.  Do not misconstrue my comments: this not a book of essays preaching and pontificating on any of these profound things; this is a book filled with fascinating characters and wondrous interactions. Bradbury never beats his reader over the head with profundity; it is the reader himself who adds that to Bradbury's intriguing tales.<br /><br />Tales-that's the word I've been searching for.  This is a book of tales.  Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Sharer\\" is a short story.  Ray Bradbury's \\"The Man in the Rorschach Shirt\\" is a tale.  In fact, let us use the French word \\"conte\\" as we would to describe the little slices of the world that we see in the contes of Guy de Maupassant.  Bradbury is the English de Maupassant as de Maupassant is the French Bradbury.<br /><br />I used to picture Bradbury as purely a writer of science fiction, but I was wrong to limit him to a specific genre.  This collection of one hundred tales is proof irrefutable of Bradbury's broad range and scope.  The book should take one quite a while to read, by the way.  True, one could blast through it with all those remarkable speed reading techniques, but what a shame to do so. These tales need to be read one at a time and then pondered and mulled over as one would savor the taste of fine food and good wine.  To gulp them down in a feeding frenzy is to forgo the pleasure of remembering them and of adding their implicit lessons to one's own repertoire of knowledge. In fact, the three months I spent on this book was too brief a period.  I shall keep it at hand and reread these tales, perhaps one a week for the next one hundred weeks.  This feast is incredible, and I would not have it fade from memory too quickly.  Please join me at the table and dine on Bradbury's joyously creative wit and wisdom.irrefutable of Bradbury's broad range and scope.  The book should take one quite a while to read, by the way.

US	52973885	R39HXXZ9A19NA6	0393323315	412397820	The Sea-Hawk	Books	5	11	13	N	N	No Superficial Linguistic Dust Here	Having recently read several modern novels by contemporary authors, I was transported by THE SEA-HAWK back in time to an earlier style of writing and a distinctly different use of language.  How many books, for instance, have you read lately that use the verb \\"trepan\\" very frequently?  Didn't think so.<br /><br />Having found modern authors' use of language to be pretty bland and, in a few instances, actually to violate grammatical convention, I was thrilled to encounter Sabatini's 1915 novel with its beautiful, effective use of the language.  For a lad born and educated in Europe, Sabatini wrote in English with a felicity that usually eludes native-born American writers, and, dare I say, quite a few British authors, too.  Thinking of the modern American authors I have read lately, I can say with pleasure that reading Sabatini is like taking a fresh, invigorating intellectual shower and thoroughly ridding oneself of the superficial linguistic dust lingering from their various works.<br /><br />Of course, there is far more to THE SEA-HAWK than its sparkling use of language.  Sir Oliver, or, to use his Muslim name, Sakr-el-Bhar, is a complex character who responds to his changing fortunes as a real person who wishes to survive and even prosper, yet who retains his dignity in the face of undeserved adversities that could have easily crushed a lesser man. The plot is truly gripping, and the reader eagerly pursues the story to learn what will befall Sir Oliver next and whether he can somehow extricate himself from this new quandary and perhaps even turn the situation to his advantage.<br /><br />All is believable.  The settings in which the plot unfolds are exotic but realistic.  Though he knows it is fiction, the reader can easily accept the reality of the setting, the characters, and the action. While certain fortuitous coincidences do occur from time to time, no miraculous escapes or incredible rescues are foisted upon the hapless reader.  Nothing untoward jars him from his vicarious participation in this great adventure.<br /><br />Enjoy THE SEA-HAWK for its wonderful use of language. Enjoy it for the variety and depth of its characters.  Enjoy it as a swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.  (One simply cannot write about Sabatini without using the word \\"swashbuckling\\" at least once.)  Enjoy it for the reality of its settings and events.  There are critics who say that THE SEA-HAWK does not reach quite the same degree of excellence as do some of Sabatini's other novels, such as CAPTAIN BLOOD and SCARAMOUCHE.  However, I beg to disagree with them.  If you have enjoyed any of Sabatini's other novels, do not hesitate to read this one, for it is equally enjoyable.  If you are coming to Sabatini for the first time, you will find THE SEA-HAWK to be a fascinating introduction to his work, and you will be as motivated as I to follow it with several of his other novels.

US	52973885	RW76CQG3497MQ	0743486226	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Helicopter Jumping?  Come on now!	As are the other Dan Brown novels I have read, ANGELS & DEMONS is an amalgamation of James Bond and Indiana Jones motifs, leaning perhaps more heavily toward the latter.  And, as with the other novels, this one is characterized by non-stop action from beginning to end.  Brown's novels are, without doubt, the best possible examples of \\"page-turners\\" in modern fictional literature.<br /><br />Brown is also adept at leading his readers to false conclusions, for those characters who appear the most likely rogues turn out to have been true and steadfast after all, while the one who appears to be the emerging hero is, at the conclusion, unveiled as the penultimate villain.  Yet this observation is an oversimplification, for the villainy itself is seen to have resulted from a most unpredictable happenstance, and nothing is quite as black and white as it appeared.<br /><br />ANGELS & DEMONS is especially enjoyable for the great irony that comes to light in its final few chapters, mankind's spiritual faith having been magnificently uplifted as the result of a spurious, clandestine, malevolent plot.  I wonder if this might also be interpreted as an insightful commentary on the gullibility of the masses?<br /><br />One thing about any fictional work that I must experience if I am to enjoy the reading experience fully is the ability to believe in its vicarious veracity.  By this, I mean that, although I know that I am experiencing fiction, I must be able to set aside my disbelief and feel that the story is \\"real\\" while I, as the reader, am part of it.  Details that jar me back into my own reality weaken the hold that story has on me.  Unfortunately, ANGELS & DEMONS has several such \\"potholes\\" in its narrative:<br /><br />When our assassin's thoughts are quoted as \\"They have chosen wisely,\\" our own thoughts fly away from the novel directly to the old knight in the Indiana Jones movie THE LAST CRUSADE, of whose speech this is a very close paraphrase.  (Another Brown novel paraphrases the knight's other comment that one has chosen poorly.)<br /><br />When Maximilian Kohler is described as being \\"disinterested\\" in winning any hospitality awards, the reader is bruised and battered by Brown's (and his proofreaders') ignorance of English grammar.  \\"Disinterested\\" is not synonymous with \\"uninterested\\" and denotes a thoroughly different meaning, which in totally illogical in this context.  What is the significance of one error of this sort in a 569-page book?  It is one error that should not have been there!<br /><br />An equally grave grammatical faux pas exists in chapter 87, when the camerlengo says, \\"Have both he [sic] and his camera-woman meet me outside the Sistine Chapel.\\"  This is the sort of foolish error that pervades freshman essays, not published novels!<br /><br />At one point, Brown has his academic professorial protagonist, Robert Langdon, state that multiple faiths carry similar requirements and penalties, including condemnation to hell, and he specifically mentions the Bible, the Koran, and Buddhist scripture.  A slight problem arises in that Buddhist scripture does not envision consignment of lost souls to any sort of hell as Christianity envisions it.  Such a gaffe destroys the reader's belief in Langdon as a proficient academician, contrary to Brown's intent.<br /><br />There are more examples like these, but let's jump to the most astounding situation of all, one that absolutely destroys every vestige of virtual reality that the story may retain, Langdon's jumping from a helicopter thousands of feet in the air, holding on to a windshield-covering tarp with nothing but the muscles in his hands, and actually surviving his fall into the Tiber River.  Now, I'm willing to go to great lengths to maintain the fiction in my mind and to enjoy the continuing story as if it were indeed reality. However, this nonsense is so far beyond anything that could conceivably happen in real life that suspending disbelief is no longer possible.  Thank goodness this occurs near the end of the novel, or I would probably have tossed the whole ridiculous thing in the trash then and there.<br /><br />In brief, the novel generally provides a spell-binding mystery amidst swashbuckling adventure.  Most parts of it are a fun and an entertainingly distracting read.  Now and then, however, errors and thoroughly unbelievable situations rudely interrupt the fantasy, disappointingly destroying the vicarious reality of the story.

US	52973885	R1GGL2DJWZ301	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	4	30	60	N	N	Restores My Faith in Modern Fiction	I came to Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE having recently read three other modern novels (Updike's THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK, Crichton's PREY, and Uris' OHARA'S CHOICE), none of which was particularly captivating.  Updike, while perhaps attempting a parody, achieves the ridiculous while losing the humor. Crichton merely rewrote his earlier novel THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN while changing nothing but the cast of characters.  Uris' characters remain as conflicted at the end of his novel as they were at its beginning.  A fourth modern novel that I struggled through a little longer ago, Naslund's AHAB'S WIFE, is so full of red herrings as well as characters endowed with neither reality nor purpose that it rates no further notice at all. My point here is that I came to THE DA VINCI CODE with a jaundiced eye, expecting yet another literary failure and even wondering why I was bothering to read anything written after the early 20th century.<br /><br />I was in for a wonderful surprise.  Mixing real, historical secret societies with fictional characters and plot, Brown pilots the reader down a veritable race course of a book.  The action, intrigue, and mystery gallop at breakneck speed from beginning to end.  Religious symbolism is artfully interwoven throughout the plot, and the heavy debt that Christian mythology owes to Pagan beliefs is brought to light in skillful narrative and dialogue.<br /><br />Yet, for all of its originality and captivating action, the book is not entirely new.  Several scenarios and bits of dialogue here and there are derivative of the Indiana Jones movies starring Harrison Ford.  I am thoroughly convinced that author Brown watched INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE quite a few times before beginning to write THE DA VINCI CODE.  Numerous parallels exist between Brown's Robert Langdon, a Harvard academician specializing in symbology, and Indiana Jones, an academic archeologist.  Once they have been drawn from their classrooms into the field, however, both Langdon and Jones give James Bond a run for his money in the \\"action hero department.\\"<br /><br />One other character in the novel may be derivative.  At least, he constantly reminds me of a character whom I met some time ago in another film.  In the novel, the character is Silas, an albino monk and a fervent believer in the Opus Dei, a reactionary Catholic cult.  Brother Silas is continually flagellating himself, the mutilation and pain being self-administered punishments for his sins (such as multiple murders, but then I don't want to give away the plot by describing his grievous transgressions in too much detail here).  Silas reminds me very much of another monk who also flagellates himself for his sins in THE NAME OF THE ROSE, a spell-binding murder mystery set in the time of the Holy Inquisition.  As in THE DA VINCI CODE, extreme religious belief and murder intertwine to form the plot, and it is not stretching the point too far to suggest that Brown may have also been influenced by THE NAME OF THE ROSE, though whether in its book or its movie version is impossible to tell.<br /><br />That the influence of other works on Brown's novel can readily be seen is not a grievous weakness by any means.  Certainly the bulk of Brown's work appears to be refreshingly original, and THE DA VINCI CODE goes far to restore my faith in modern fiction.  If we can imagine mixing Indiana Jones with James Bond while throwing in a goodly measure of truly fascinating church history, religious fanaticism, and worldly scheming, we will have created a pretty accurate description of THE DA VINCI CODE.  To describe a book as a \\"page turner\\" has become trite through unwarranted overuse, but in Dan Brown's novel, it is highly accurate.  I've already begun to read his other novels based solely upon my delight with this one, and that is perhaps the highest recommendation I can make for partaking of his creative and imaginative stories.Langdon and Jones give James Bond a run for his money in the \\"action hero department.\\" <br /> <br />One other character in the novel may be derivative.

Having just read Dan Brown's novel THE DA VINCI CODE with great pleasure, I snagged a copy of DECEPTION POINT to continue my vicarious romp with Brown's action-packed characters.  As I had expected, the action is fast and furious from the first page to the last.  However, this novel seemed less polished than the other, with more scenarios that demanded a major effort on the part of the reader to find them believable.<br /><br />You see, the real art of fiction is that, while it is not historical truth, it must be perceivable as such by the reader if the fiction is to be successful.  While acknowledging that what he is reading is imaginary, the reader should be able to suspend his disbelief and accept, during the time he is engrossed in the story, that everything really did happen just as the author describes.  If events become too outlandish, the illusion of reality is destroyed, and the effectiveness of the story is diminished.<br /><br />In DECEPTION POINT, everything is charging along just fine when three of the protagonists plunge off the edge of a glacier.  Instead of falling into the frigid ocean, however, they all land-alive and not even critically injured-on an ice shelf that has dropped below the surface of the main glacier and that is ready to calve into the ocean.  A well-placed grenade by one of the antagonists does indeed cause the ice shelf to break from the glacier and to plunge into the freezing waters below. Our protagonists not only ride the ice down to the ocean but they also survive being submerged in the water as the ice shelf hits it and manage to stay on top of the slick ice as tons of ocean water cascade off of it as it rises to bob, now an iceberg, above the water.<br /><br />The iceberg is now floating rapidly out to sea, and our characters are on the verge of freezing.  How do they escape?  Here comes a feature right out of classical Greek drama, a Deus ex machina.  This translates as \\"God out of the machine\\" and refers to the rescue of human characters in the drama from whatever inescapable dilemma they've got themselves into through the intervention of a god who rises, literally, through the stage floor thanks to a hidden mechanical lift (the \\"machine\\").  In DECEPTION POINT, the god appears in the form of a secret submarine that had been lying silently on the floor of the ocean very near the spot where the glacier calved.  It rises from the ocean exactly as the god rose from the floor on that classical stage.  Talk about miraculous intervention!<br /><br />Another great example of credulity-stretching is the crash of the antagonists' helicopter directly above a giant magma dome on the floor of another ocean, its warhead-equipped missiles all exploding and rupturing the dome, causing an undersea volcano that opens up a great whirlpool on the surface, thereby sucking down the ship on which the last antagonist has been marooned.<br /><br />After reading THE DA VINCI CODE, I pictured the protagonists there as being something of a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond.  The characters in DECEPTION POINT are, at their most believable, pure James Bond.  In those places where the action surpasses the point of verisimilitude, and there are many more than the few I have used as examples, the level of ridiculousness surpasses even that of Peter Sellers as Chief Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies.  At least Sellers' extravagant humor is intentional!<br /><br />The action, intrigue, suspense, and mayhem plunge ahead in wild abandon throughout DECEPTION POINT.

US	52973885	RU2I4XWLC0QIF	0449912108	449727815	The Witches of Eastwick	Books	2	26	53	N	N	Not a Bewitching Read	I was attracted to Updike's novel purely by its title and was expecting either an historical novel derived from America's fear and fascination of witchcraft in the era of the Salem witch trials or perhaps a look at contemporary Wiccans or maybe something along the lines of Marion Zimmer Bradley's MISTS OF AVALON.  What I found was none of these but rather a psychological exploration of several very unbelievable characters interacting in aberrant and contrived relationships.  Two aspects of Updike's novel leave me cold-his unrealistic description of witchcraft and his horribly exaggerated similes which torture the English language.<br /><br />Updike's witches are neurotic, conflicted women who vacillate between lesbian relationships with one another and seducing all the men in town, especially married men.  Their manner of witchcraft is neither historically accurate nor even remotely descriptive of the actual practice of Wicca today, encompassing such ridiculous things as manipulating the nature of a tennis ball to foil their opponents and such purely evil things as killing crabs, pets, and another woman of whom they become jealous.  To use one's power to summon a thunderstorm for the simple reason that other people are on a beach where Alexandra wants to run her dog is purely ludicrous.  Very little of the witchcraft being practiced in the novel is believable, even in a fictional realm.  Oh yes, there's also the practice of having tacks, moths, straw, bird feathers, and suchlike materialize in the mouths of women who annoy our witch friends.  This naturally brings to mind the backfired slug spell that Ron Weasley attempts to cast on Draco Malfoy at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Somehow, though, it's much more believable in the realm of Harry Potter than in Updike's \\"serious\\" novel.<br /><br />If Updike's concept of magic is less than believable, his comprehension of effective writing is yet worse.  Several pages of THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK could easily win a Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest, a competition that challenges entrants to compose the opening sentence of the worst of all possible novels.  Updike's descriptive similes are so extravagant as to be unintentionally hilarious.  I thought at first that he was writing tongue-in-cheek in those frequent cases, poking fun at pompous authors, yet I fear that he may himself be one of those pompous writers at whom fun really should be poked.  For example:<br /><br />\\"But even as it drifted, her mind, like a passenger in an airplane who amidst the life-imperiling sensations of lifting off looks down to marvel at the enameled precision and glory of the Earth (the houses with their roofs and chimneys so sharp, so finely made, and the lakes truly mirrors as in the Christmas yards our parents had arranged while we were sleeping; it was all true, and even maps are true!), took note of how lovely Sukie was, bad luck or not, with her vivid hair disheveled and even her eyelashes looking a little mussed after her hard day of typing and looking for the right word under the harsh lights, her figure in its milky-green sweater and dark suede skirt so erect and firm, her stomach flat and her breasts perky and high and her bottom firm, and that big broad-lipped mouth on her monkeyish face so mischievous and giving and brave.\\"  I had marked many other examples of such flatulent writing, but if this one doesn't make the point, then nothing will.<br /><br />Before winding up these observations, I do feel some need to comment on the triteness in Updike's novel.  The idea of having, specifically, three witches is hardly new.  Shakespeare used that figure in MACBETH, and most readers will recognize the use of the number three in Christian mythology, as in the Holy Trinity, God-in-three-persons, etc.  The character of Darryl van Horne is a stereotypical portrayal of a homosexual male taken to extremes.  Using such worn-out and exaggerated symbolism is not the mark of a distinguished author.<br /><br />In sum, I should venture that Updike's novel may be marginally better than today's typical bodice-ripping paperbacked romance on the supermarket rack, but his characters have a very long way to go to attain the heights of the priestesses who serve the Earth Goddess in Bradley's novels of Avalon.uthor. <br /> <br />In sum, I should venture that Updike's novel may be marginally better than today's typical bodice-ripping paperbacked romance on the supermarket rack, but his characters have a very long way to go to attain the heights of the priestesses who serve the Earth Goddess in Bradley's novels of Avalon.	2004-12-07

McKinley\\" and \\"The Grizzlies of Mt. McKinley,\\" and I found \\"A Naturalist in Alaska\\" to be the most readable of the three.  In fact, if one is interested in reading Murie's descriptions of the lives and interrelationships of the lynxes, wolves, bears, wolverines, foxes, Dall sheep, caribou, and even the haymice that frequent the far flung state that calls itself \\"The Last Frontier,\\" but must select only one of Murie's published works, then \\"A Naturalist in Alaska\\" is the book to choose.<br /><br />\\"Wolves\\" and \\"Grizzlies,\\" while very rewarding to anyone curious about the real behavior of wild creatures, are perhaps best described as dispassionate and objective records of Murie's extensive observations of those animals in their native, largely unmolested habitat.  In \\"A Naturalist,\\" however, Murie gives vent to his admiration for these creatures and for the land they inhabit.  While never stinting on his objective observations, Murie interweaves his objectivity with a sense of wonder, and his descriptive writing is nearly as good as a camera lens for portraying the rolling tundra, the meandering glacial rivers, the rocky spires of the Alaska Range, and, of course, the creatures that live and die in this magnificent setting.<br /><br />The sociability of wolves with others of their pack, their ingenuity in forcing sheep down rocky bottoms where they can be outrun, the apparent games eagles play on wolves and sheep, and even the amazing ingenuity of the tiny haymouse are all skillfully portrayed in \\"A Naturalist\\" Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this book is its ability to teach and entertain equally.  The reader will enjoy the vivid descriptions of the land and its denizens while learning about the almost limitless interactions of the wild creatures with one another and, sometimes, with humankind.<br /><br />If there is any weakness in \\"A Naturalist,\\" it is that there is some overlap with Murie's other books, \\"Wolves\\" and \\"Grizzlies,\\" in that some of his field observations seem to be repeated. Of course, if one is coming to Murie for the first time, this repetition will not be apparent, and I actually enjoyed re-reading some of the antics observed in the members of the East Fork wolf den, so any criticism I have concerning the repetition is very mild indeed.<br /><br />Who will find reading this book to be time well spent?  Those interested in Alaska in particular or vast wilderness areas in general should find it rewarding.  Those interested in the habits, traits, activities, and personalities of wild creatures that are only beginning to adapt to the spread of humankind into their pristine land will also enjoy Murie's writing.  Aspiring writers should find inspirational examples of descriptive writing here.  Do not, however, seek to find adrenaline-raising stories of harrowing encounters between hapless humans and ravenous bears or crazed wolverines, for that is seldom real life, and Murie's books are all about real life (although there are a couple of stories of some near encounters that make the reader wonder how he or she would have reacted in Murie's place).<br /><br />I account my own time in reading this book to have been well spent, and I believe that you will, too.  And if reading \\"A Naturalist\\" leaves you feeling a little humbled at your place on this earth, then I believe that you will feel as Murie himself felt and that he would be pleased with the success of his book.is that there is some overlap with Murie's other books, \\"Wolves\\" and \\"Grizzlies,\\" in that some of his field observations seem to be repeated.

US	52973885	R1V4P1HVRLNF9Z	0817012842	47528333	This Train Is Bound for Glory: The Story of America's Chapel Cars	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Railroad Religiosity	The ingenuity of humans in furthering their own ends is practically boundless. Add to that ingenuity the fervor of 19th and early 20th century evangelists to proselytize and \\"save\\" all the non-believers around the country and we see why the railroad chapel car was conceived.  Factor in the competitiveness of different denominations and we see why one chapel car grew into a dozen rolling churches representing three different groups, Episcopal, Baptist and Catholic. These specially-designed cars with pews, pulpits, and cramped living quarters for the missionaries (and, when applicable, their wives) saw a long run, too, lasting from the 1890's into the 1940's.  THIS TRAIN IS BOUND FOR GLORY is a 382-page history of these twelve special chapel cars, plus a quick glance at two more, the monstrously ornate cars of the Russian Orthodox Church which may have inspired the first American chapel car and the private car of Mormon founder Brigham Young, said to have had angels painted on its ceiling.<br /><br />So far as the book THIS TRAIN... is concerned, I find reviewing its quality to be a particularly difficult task, for it is without doubt the result of lengthy, exhaustive research, many times in primary sources which required significant travel by the authors. The extensive, meticulous research evident in this book is truly impressive and is far and away its strongest element. There is no question that, based upon the research, the end-of-chapter documentation sections, and the minute historical details that the authors extracted from the huge mounds of historical detritus through which they picked, this book fully rates the maximum of five stars-and then some.<br /><br />However, the readability of the book does not fare quite so well.  Many parts of it read as though the authors had before them a stack of note cards, filled with all sorts of historical facts related more or less to the car being discussed, and merely transcribed these notes into a narrative, paragraphed form, resulting in jerky and sometimes disconnected text.  One must also wonder whether some of the extreme minutiae are really worthy of being discussed in even a detailed history book.<br /><br />Even more troubling to the discerning reader than the uneven flow of the narrative is the apparent moral judgements of the authors that are repeatedly woven into the text.  Granted, some of these may be paraphrases from the authors' sources, but the footnoting is not sufficiently clear to show this to be the case. A typical example is on page 117 where the authors proclaim that Gillette, Wyoming was \\"a godless place\\" and then proceed to equate the presence of saloons, dance halls, gambling houses and brothels to godlessness. Such moral condemnation has little place in an objective historical account.<br /><br />Fortunately, every now and then, a bit of significant American history is revealed, the type of history that tells much more about the \\"American façade\\" than we shall find in our cleansed and purified public school textbooks. For instance, from page 123, we learn that a \\"man was forced to kiss the flag because he had criticized President Wilson, and a Union Pacific employee of Russian ancestry was stripped and painted yellow because he refused to buy a Victory bond.... [In some communities] German books were burned.\\"  Finding history such as this is more than enough reason to read books that have not been approved by school boards!<br /><br />A strange index is included at the end of the book.  It is more or less alphabetical but is also arranged according to the name of the chapel car to which the index entries refer. Hence, to locate, say, a town name, one must look under each car's list of entries since more than one car (or none) may have visited that town.  Looking up references to Brigham Young, simply because that entry caught my eye, I noted that the reference was to a very cursory mention in one chapter while a more significant discussion of the man andhis private railroad car was not listed-unless the entry was somewhere else in this confusing \\"index.\\"  In either case, the index is not user-friendly.<br /><br />The book is formatted in an unusual horizontal format, making it awkward to hold while reading. One really needs a desk rather than a lap to support the book.  Yet, it is not really a \\"coffee table book\\" because, while there are some excellent historical photographs, its raison d'être lies in the text, and it cannot be lightly browsed.<br /><br />Impressive research. Uneven narrative flow. Possible intrusion of authors' moral judgements. Important historical insights here and there.  Index of dubious usefulness.  Awkward format. Shall we \\"round off\\" a 2.5 rating and give it three stars?  With that rating, however, comes the suggestion that the reader borrow the book from a library before deciding to add it to a permanent home collection.man and his private railroad car was not listed-unless the entry was somewhere else in this confusing \\"index.\\"  In either case, the index is not user-friendly. <br /> <br />The book is formatted in an unusual horizontal format, making it awkward to hold while reading.

That Andr&eacute;-Louis Moreau chooses this as his character when, fleeing the hangman's noose, he joins a traveling theatrical troupe, is but one of the many ironies in Sabatini's captivating novel, for Andr&eacute;-Louis is anything but a buffoon, and only those of the Privileged class would have called him a rascal-or worse.<br /><br />Andr&eacute;-Louis is a complex protagonist, and he exudes irony throughout this novel in which neither suspense nor action ever lags. He adamantly refuses to see himself as a man of action, yet his speeches incite the restive crowds in both Rennes and Nantes, adding his powerful voice to the other catalysts of the French Revolution. He insists that he himself does not hold these dangerous republican views and is merely giving voice to his murdered friend, Vilmorin, yet he finds himself a republican member of the Assembly and instrumental in hastening the downfall of the Privileged class.<br /><br />On a personal level, despite Andr&eacute;-Louis' acute awareness of the madness of the world around him and his skillful artistry in manipulating that madness to achieve his ends, he is obstinately blind to the love that Aline holds for him, attributing her actions to a non-existent love for his nemesis, Monsieur de La Tour d'Azyr. Perhaps the ultimate irony, at least on such a private level, envelops the relationship between Andr&eacute;-Louis and d'Azyr, but the revelation of that is saved for the final chapters of the novel, and I'll not destroy that suspense by revealing it here.<br /><br />Sabatini's novel seamlessly interweaves fiction with history, and the window of history that he has chosen as his backdrop is a stirring one. The social injustices perpetrated by the French Privileged classes upon the commoners of the country have reached a climax. Violent revolution is at hand. If, Good Reader, you have not had the fortune to attend a live performance of Boubil and Sch&ouml;nberg's musical Les Mis&eacute;rables, go now and purchase the videocassette recording. While hardly equivalent to the stage production, the recording will still heighten your understanding of  and empathy for the emotions of the \\"canaille,\\" the rabble, as they become ever more violent in their opposition to the Privileged class that rules their society.  Nor would it hurt to have a recording of the Revolutionary song Ça Ira and its successor, La Marseillaise, sounding their messages of revolt against societal wrongs as you read Scaramouche!<br /><br />Sabatini's novel remains as intriguing and, yes, as stirring to the emotions of the reader as when it was newly published eighty-three years ago. Read it for its atmosphere of revolt against the wrongs perpetrated by the minority elite against the common majority. Read it for its cover-to-cover collection of delightful ironies.

US	52973885	R1O8UYT1YJVQP2	0804732094	756394833	Railroad Voices: Narratives by Linda Niemann, Photographs by Lina Bertucci	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Voices in the Night	Gritty, dusty, muddy, ballast-strewn dirt under foot. A coppery feeling in the mouth. Eyes strained and burning, almost too tired to open. Perpetual noise---the incessant squeaking, grinding, thumping and crashing of heavy, lumbering machinery. Break time, and the codgers slumping in straight-back chairs leaned against the wall are all snoring, smoking, or describing their latest sexual conquests. Oily, smoky air stinking of hot grease. The feel, smell, look and sound of heavy industry, all the same day after day, night after night. These are the sensations that Niemann and Bertucci's book leaves in the reader's mind.<br />The title and even the subject matter notwithstanding, I hesitate to categorize this book as a volume on railroading. The impressions of the people and their work-lives that are featured in the prose and the photographs are descriptive of all those who labor in the blue-collar jobs of heavy industry. These railroaders have much in common with miners, steel mill workers, grain elevator operators, truck builders, and all the rest on whom our nation's economy depends.<br />If we must, because of its focus, speak of it as a railroad book, let us be clear about what it is not: There are no ballads or wreck songs here, no folklore about John Henry or Casey Jones, no heroic histories of rail disasters, no financial analyses or statistics of ton-miles hauled or ruminations on the nostalgic era of steam locomotives. What we really have is a book of contemporary photographs, some taken with film and some painted with the brush of words. Both kinds of photos reveal the grass-roots operating railroader and the real, unembellished, and usually uninspiring environment in which he or she labors.<br />What is the lasting value of this book? It is truly American sociology and history. Not the history of the corporate board room. Not the history of company economics. Not even the technological history behind roller bearings and the huge diesel-electrics that haul unit trains from Powder River coal fields to the ravenous furnaces of east coast electrical generating plants. The history in this book is both more basic and more essential, for it shows us the working conditions of the people who make the machine run, whose work enables the rail corporations to prosper, and whose personalities are shaped by the unsympathetic and unending tasks set for them.<br />If, Gentle Reader, you react badly to harsh language, to untempered sexual remarks, or to photos including \\"explicit\\" centerfolds taped to a yardman's locker door, then perhaps this book is not destined for your reading list. On the other hand, if you find fascination (or perhaps reminiscence) in unexpurgated portrayals of blue-collar working Americans or if you merely wish to understand the demands of such work and how it shapes the people who perform it, then I believe that you will treasure this book as a most worthy addition to your library. Whether you shelve it with your books on sociology, heavy industry, American history, or transportation will be your call. It integrates them all.<br />By the way, if you find fulfillment with \\"Railroad Voices,\\" explore \\"Set Up Running,\\" a similar exploration into the life of a real, unremarkable railroader, an engineman on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Both books show us the real world of the railroad employee with grease on his (or her) clothes, gloves on his (or her) hand, and a union dues deduction in his (or her) paycheck.nit trains from Powder River coal fields to the ravenous furnaces of east coast electrical generating plants.

Bush's America	Books	5	33	42	N	N	Like Governor, Like President	The blurb inside the dust jacket on Ivins and Dubose's book  asserts (in red letters no less) that ?Bushwhacked is a hilarious, no-holds-barred look at George W. Bush....?<br />Now, this book is many things--an illuminating muckraker, a disturbing ripping of the veil of secrecy, an expos? of the chicanery beneath Bush's public face, a revelation of the extreme religious fundamentalism  that drives his partisan policies--but \\"hilarious\\" it isn't. On the contrary, \\"Bushwhacked\\" is scary in its examples of how Bush, both as Texas governor and as U.S. president, has promulgated a long series of destructive policies and is little more than a mouthpiece for self-serving, would-be aristocrats such as Karl Rove.<br />While \\"Bushwhacked\\" is not rich with the wit that characterizes Ivins' typical newspaper columns, her ironic turn of phrase cannot be totally suppressed and does surface from time to time. For the most part, however, this book is deadly serious, but that is not to say that it is preachy. The authors neither lecture nor pontificate but rather set forth example upon example of real people who have lost their part of \\"the American dream\\" as the direct result of Bush's governmental policies and practices.  The shame of it all is that Bush brought no surprises with him to the White House.  Many of his presidential policies had already been implemented at state level while he was governor of Texas, and many of those policies were so disastrous that even the conservative Texas legislature overturned them when Bush left the state.<br />Are Ivins and Dubose practicing \\"Bushbashing\\" as today's neo-conservatives phrase it?  How simple it is to create belittling labels with which to condemn others.  Such labels keep one from having to consider issues at all, don't they?  As I would expect from discerning researchers such as these authors, neither stoops to such ad hominem attacks.  On the contrary, they merely set forth factual occurrences in the political history of George W. Bush (and several of his advisors) and permit the reader to draw his own conclusions as to the morality, ethics and constitutionality of each scenario.  And, unlike those who depend on emotive attack and innuendo to make their case, Ivins and Dubose document their sources chapter by chapter.  In fact, there are no fewer than 22 pages of sources listed!  There is also a detailed index in the back for those who may be using this book as a source for their own studies of  particular topics or persons.<br />So we see that the book is (1) factual, (2) based on demonstrable historical events, and (3) well documented.  But how valuable is it in the long run?  What happens to its value when Bush is no longer in office?  To profit most from its revelations, read it before the next presidential elections. Yet, do not feel that it becomes irrelevant after those elections either. Policies, judicial appointments, treaties made (and broken) now will affect the history of the United States long into the future.  Both supporters and opponents of the Bush presidency must acknowledge that his actions have had, are having, and will continue to have a telling impact not only on the USA but also on the entire world.  The information in \\"Bushwhacked,\\" disturbing as it may be, is of permanent value to all who profess to be informed citizens of this nation or of the world.  The book is fully worth its purchase price and, much more importantly, it is worth the time out of your life span that you devote to reading it.e W.

The story lines are essentially identical-virulent agents are released into the atmosphere and wreak havoc on hapless humans in their paths until the agents are (presumably but not definitively) destroyed.  The old story features alien biological microbes that continually mutate through a deadly pathogenic form into a benign form that escapes from the lab and  disappears over the ocean, while the new story features molecular level machines engineered through human nanotechnology.  The old story has the malevolent agents intentionally brought to earth via a military research satellite while the new one has them intentionally released from a laboratory in an attempt to force their evolution into a form desired by the researchers.  If there is anything new in \\"Prey\\" that was not in \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" it is the contribution that corporate greed makes to the near-destruction of humanity.<br />The resurrected three-decade-old plot still plays well in its new attire as a fun story intended for nothing more than escapist reading.  Crichton does include an introduction that attempts to give the novel the appearance of a social commentary, warning that humanity may be developing technology that it is too ignorant to control.  So what's new?  Humanity did that back in the 1940's with its ill-starred development of nuclear weapons.  Certainly, there are novelists writing in the science fiction genre who provide outstanding commentary on the human condition.  Zenna Henderson (author of \\"The People\\") comes to mind as a prime example.  Crichton, however, is not one of them, nor does the bibliography (an unusual addition to a sci-fi novel) turn \\"Prey\\" into a serious examination of technological versus social progress.<br />Underneath its veneer of social commentary, and despite its repetition of a thirty-year-old story line, \\"Prey\\" emerges as a simple excursion into a brief but entertaining fantasy adventure.  After something of a slow start, the story begins picking up its pace until the reader is fairly running along with the unfolding events.  Now and then, a repetitious comment does appear, and the occasional commentary on algorithms and nanotechnology research does put on the brakes, but by and large the story forges ahead at a seldom-slackening pace.<br />The ending is not totally satisfactory.  Whereas, \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" pretty well assures us of the natural destruction of the mutated microbial cloud, leaving only the smallest doubt in the mind of the viewer or reader, \\"Prey\\" leaves quite a few loose ends flapping about. We are left wondering if our hero/protagonist \\"Jack\\" is entirely rid of the infesting nanogizmos, if his children have rid themselves of the little buggers, how his sister even got exposed, whether Mae has the good news that her smile suggests, ands where the heck Bob Woodward is to expose all of the corporate evildoers (at least those who haven't died) on the front page of The Washington Post.  Look, real life is full of loose ends, but when we read an escapist fantasy like \\"Prey,\\" we want those ends nicely tied up at the end.  Oh well, the book should make for a marvelous \\"grade-B\\" movie script, and I'll probably even pay to see it-but not at theater prices.  This will be one more  movie that will have to come out on cheap home video before I'll spring for the admission price.ts repetition of a thirty-year-old story line, \\"Prey\\" emerges as a simple excursion into a brief but entertaining fantasy adventure.

I first encountered him in this gripping tale about 47 years ago in the pages of a Classics Comic book.  Readers nearing their sixth decade may recall these delightful comic books, which converted serious fiction into the colored drawings and essential dialogue of comic book characters, possibly in a desperate attempt to expose youngsters to literature in some form at least.  However, I cannot say that I was particularly enraptured by the story of Dr. Peter Blood at that time.  Perhaps I was yet too young to have the mature imagination required to appreciate fully the exploits that are so vividly described in Sabatini's book.  In any event, I have now read the \\"real thing\\" and have enjoyed my vicarious adventure aboard the Arabella tremendously.<br />This Penguin Classics edition also includes a highly educational introduction that helps the reader recognize and appreciate the various themes that run through this grand historical novel.  While the introduction can be totally ignored and the story enjoyed just for its sea-faring, swashbuckling adventurism, a little understanding of the genre of the historical novel, of Sabatini's sources, and of the type of protagonist exemplified by the character of Peter Blood will add to that enjoyment even further.  In fact, not only did I read the introduction before beginning the story itself, but I went back and re-read it after finishing the novel, appreciating its contributions to my understanding even more.<br />I particularly like Sabatini's own comments that are quoted in the introduction: \\"It is demanded of the writer of fiction, whether novelist or dramatist, that the events he sets forth shall be endowed with the quality of verisimilitude. What he writes need not necessarily be true; but, at least, it must seem to be true, so that it may carry that conviction without which interest fails to be aroused.\\" This reminds me of Coleridge's admonition that the successful reader of poetry must enforce a \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" in order to mentally join with the author in the shared experience of writing and reading. In the case of Captain Blood, suspending disbelief is in no way a challenge. This historical novel, skillfully intermixing the factual and the fanciful, the real and the imagined, the history and the fiction, is a believable yet romantic tale straight from the Golden Age of Piracy on the High Seas.<br />What is amazing to me is that Captain Blood has, at the moment I write this, only about 20 or so reader reviews posted, while a modern novel I recently read, Ahab's Wife, has some 171 reviews! The pity of it is that Ahab's Wife is a poorly written, shallow, superficial sort of thing that will be hardly remembered 82 years from now, while Captain Blood remains as vigorous, exciting and enthralling a read as when it was first published 82 years ago. Why do we so often overlook the excellent-nay, say rather the outstanding-books that were laid in our laps before we were even born while we waste time with artificial garbage cranked out by modern hack writers?<br />The beauty of Sabatini's Captain Blood is that it is timeless.  It will be as exciting for your grandchildren to read as it will be for you, and it will be there for theirs to read, too.  This book is as modern as any can be and deserves your time to read it.  I started to say \\"your effort,\\" but it requires no effort to read.  The suspense and action will carry you along as surely as the Caribbean winds filled the Arabella's sails and carried her effortlessly across the expanse of the sea from one glorious adventure to another.<br />If there is any weakness in this book where the modern reader is concerned, it is that few of us will understand Blood's occasional remarks rendered in flawless Latin.  I regret that I am too ignorant to grasp the significance of those remarks, for I am certain that they hold wonderful irony and are quitemeaningful in the situations in which Blood finds himself at the moment of their utterance.  It would have been thoughtful of today's editor to take into account the fact that we are now largely ignorant of classical languages and to include a footnote or two translating those lines for us. Beyond this, I can levy no criticism against this edition of the novel, and I can assure you that any discerning reader who will suspend his disbelief and embrace the mythical romance of the Caribbean pirate will enjoy his time with this book.e meaningful in the situations in which Blood finds himself at the moment of their utterance.

Rather, he takes several popular characters from other sources and molds them to his needs.  Likewise, the story lines of bad king versus good-but-outnumbered rebels, young innocent farm boy evolving into heroic warrior, etc. are hardly unknown to the science fiction genre but are nonetheless well handled by Paolini in creating a highly readable and entertaining story.  While Paolini may not be a creator of totally new concepts, he certainly shows himself skilled at adaptation and improvisation, building a good read out of old materials.<br />The reader will easily recognize many influences on the author as he created the novel Eragon.  Anne McCaffrey's series of novels about the dragonriders of Pern are an obvious influence, but I believe that J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels have had even a greater influence than McCaffrey's works.  Some parallels with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories can be argued, and the \\"Evil Empire\\" against which the rebels struggle evokes images of the Star Wars motion pictures.  Readers familiar with these various sources will quickly see Paolini's Brom as the counterpart of Tolkien's Gandolf.  Paolini's Urgals are dead ringers for Tolkien's Orcs.  The Elfin race goes by the same name in both Paolini and Tolkien.  Paolini's two Ra'zacs remind one of Tolkien's nine Nazgul.  The words that Eragon uses to lift stones and cast destruction on his enemies suggest the magic of Rowling's Harry Potter.  And on and on go the parallels.<br />Paolini's strength, however, lies not in the direct retelling of any of his source materials but in the adaptation of the sources' character types to his own ends.  His novel is not a close variation of any of his sources' story lines but is his own creation.  That the reader recognizes others' characters reborn in Paolini's work actually makes them even more endearing.  Here are some of the old friends that we first met in other books reborn into a new environment and a different time.  Their resurrection is pleasant and we are happy to see them in action once more.<br />Unhappily, a very few grammatical errors found their way past both the author and his proofreaders. While these are but few, they still assault readers' sensibilities and leave behind a most unpleasant residue in their minds. In each instance, these involve the use of the first person objective case pronoun when use of the nominative case is appropriate. These would probably not be so jarring were overall usage elsewhere in the novel less excellent.<br />In sum, I believe that those who have has enjoyed McCaffrey's dragonrider novels or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings will also enjoy Paolini's Eragon.  If one has read neither McCaffrey nor Tolkien but still enjoys an adventure fraught with peril, magic, a few monsters, and a sentient dragon, then I would still feel safe in recommending Paolini.  On the other hand, if a reader seeks classical conflict, detailed character development, and the relief of an effective denouement at the end of it all, then he probably shouldn't be looking for a novel in the modern science fiction genre in the first place! I am anticipating Paolini's next novel in what he calls the Inheritance Triology with eagerness.nds that we first met in other books reborn into a new environment and a different time.

Whatever the reason, I came to O'Hara's Choice with high expectations, too high as it turned out.  The novel is little but a high-class \\"bodice ripper,\\" a modern romance with no well developed theme and poorly justified actions.  The characters appear flat as well, leaving the novel very much as they entered it with little discernible character development en route.  Let's take a look first at the strong points of the book.  Unfortunately, this will not take us long.<br />Uris does have a fine command of the language and has produced 394 pages without allowing trite, overused phraseology to weaken either description or dialogue.  At rare times, the writing does flow at a rapid clip, carrying the reader along almost effortlessly, and I offer the description of the battle of Bull Run (to become known as the first battle of Manassas) as a welcome example of this.  The early sexual tension between Zach and Amanda is also handled adroitly although elsewhere it sometimes mimics the \\"bodice ripper\\" genre. The inter-service jealousy and derision between the Navy and the Marine Corps is realistically portrayed but becomes tedious and repetitious after a while. Horace Kerr's internal dichotomy between his progressive thoughts toward the recently-freed Negroes and his culturally learned biases against non-white races comes to the fore several times, but some of his explosions are not well supported by earlier thoughts and actions and appear artificial and contrived. So much for the strong points.<br />Uris' introduction of the various characters strikes me as poorly accomplished.  It is as though one is watching a disconnected slide show (or, for our younger readers who may never have seen a slide show, let's call it a PowerPoint presentation).  Characters pop up rather unexpectedly, and the reader has a poor idea of what their relationship may be to the other characters until much further along in the reading.  Fortunately, Uris begins each chapter with the date and location of the action. These \\"stage directions\\" do help keep us somewhat oriented as to where and when we are, but we must be careful top pay attention to them or risk significant confusion.<br />Several \\"red herrings\\" crop up here and there with no particular contribution to the story line.  For instance, Horace Kerr, Amanda's rich industrialist father, is set up to lose his life in a storm at sea but survives with a few bumps and bruises.  Later he is equally foreshadowed to suffer a debilitating if not fatal stroke, but that coup de grace never comes after all.<br />Then there is Emily, Amanda's older sister, who is mentally unbalanced and is generally stored away out of sight in the unfrequented north wing of the mansion.  I suppose she functions fairly well as one of several skeletons in the Kerr family closet, a fact that is strongly underscored once the reader finally learns the horrible secret that explains her insanity.  Still, she never plays even a strong supporting role in the Amanda - Zach relationship, which is the unifying thread throughout the book, and the reader is left to wonder whether her character might have been more fully developed--or omitted.<br />Is there even an identifiable theme in this novel?  Basically we find two young lovers, one torn between her duty to carry on the family fortune and power and her desire to marry her Marine lover; the other torn between his love (or lust) for Amanda and his \\"marriage\\" to the Marine Corps.  The latter problem is exacerbated by a dreadful secret that Zach carries with him concerning his Marine-hero father.  None of these conflicts ever finds satisfactory resolution.  There is no denouement.  The lovers are conflicted to begin with and are equally conflicted when the novel ends.  Their situation, while at times compared with that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, never reaches the tragic level of those more famous lovers, whose position as the symbols of unachievable love remains unassailed by Uris' novel.he tragic level of those more famous lovers, whose position as the symbols of unachievable love remains unassailed by Uris' novel.	2004-04-16
US	52973885	R189122S02KLKM	0385722168	211011926	In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture	Books	5	9	9	N	N	An Intriguing and Entertaining History	What an illuminating history and how clearly penned is this book!  McGrath demonstrates how the great social forces that changed the face of Europe and England set the stage upon which the Translation that produced the King James Version of the Bible would be played out.  Beginning with the Renaissance, progressing through the Reformation, and showing the impact of even the defeat of the Spanish armada, McGrath paints for the reader a portrait of evolving societies that demanded a Bible that they themselves could read, be their language French, Spanish or English.<br />McGrath shows us how the changing fortunes of the English tongue itself played a preparatory role in the demand for an English language Bible, and how the rise of the English merchant classes brought what had been a second-class language into respectable usage.  Ah, but there was great political danger in allowing a Bible to be written in the people's tongue.  How could the church fathers maintain control and exert their accustomed influence if the people were no longer forced to depend upon them to read, interpret and explain the Latin scriptures to their flocks?  (Their Latin Bibles were, of course, only translations themselves, but doubtless few clerics could have understood the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek originals!)<br />And that blasted Reformation!  Now we had Puritans interpreting the Bible their way-which weakened the concept of the divine right of kings and threatened the future of the monarchy.  That certainly had to be opposed!  Such political considerations led to bans on publishing Bibles in the English tongue and to the execution of those who would dare do so abroad.  Still, by the time that James VI of Scotland and I of England assumed the throne, English translations of the Bible did exist, several versions of them in fact, including one printed in Geneva by English expatriates.  This was a particularly dangerous version inasmuch as it was favored by the Puritan movement and was growing in popularity despite opposition from the Anglican bishops.  All of this religious rancor, of course, permeated the entire government, for religion and worldly politics were thoroughly intertwined and inseparable.<br />Perhaps, James thought, directing that a new translation be made would mollify the warring political/religious elements of his realm.  Although his goal was not immediately realized, the consequences of his decision were more far-reaching and influential than he could have possibly foreseen.  Privately published and sold by venture capitalists, largely ignored or rejected upon its publication in 1611, and fraught with printing errors, the King James Version was not precisely a best seller for quite a long while. It was a rather inauspicious start for what would become one of the most influential books in the English language.<br />I read McGrath's book after Adam Nicolson's \\"God's Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible.\\"  The two works are not repetitive, for they approach the same history from different perspectives.  While McGrath generally focuses on the broader linguistic, economic and social movements that eventually created a demand for an English language Bible and explains the political necessity for yet another translation under King James, Nicolson focuses largely on the personalities of the king, his advisors, and on what is known of the individual Translators and their six companies.  The two books complement each other nicely, and I would recommend reading both, though, if a reader absolutely must limit himself to just one of the two, then perhaps McGrath's book will give the more thorough understanding.<br />Bear in mind, gentle sir or madam, that, unless you are yourself fluent in ancient Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, you, no more than I, have never read and will never be able to read any biblical texts.  The best we can manage is to read a translation, itself based on and heavily influenced by even earlier translations, all of which were themselves influenced by the degree of linguistic skill of the translators, by their own beliefs and biases, and by the secular and church politics that controlled them.  Both McGrath's and Nicolson's books will be of inestimable help in understanding just what it is that we are reading today when we claim to be reading the Bible.  May I also emphasize that one need not be a follower of Jewish or Christian theology to enjoy these histories.  Both educate in a most entertaining way, but, best of all, neither preaches.hich were themselves influenced by the degree of linguistic skill of the translators, by their own beliefs and biases, and by the secular and church politics that controlled them.

US	52973885	R1VJEZSDDRQZB8	0385093306	738392231	Good-Bye to All That: An Autobiography	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Masterful and Ironic Caricatures of Human Folly	\\"Good-Bye to All That\\" is one of the most imminently readable autobiographies I have yet come across. Generally, I do not particularly care for the autobiographical genre of writing, nor, based on my public school and university history textbooks, would I have professed much interest in history.  Graves' book, however, changes \\"all that.\\" Two aspects of the book have endeared it to me:<br />First, Graves' writing style is replete with droll, dry wit. His use of irony to paint word pictures in his readers' minds is masterful.  His use of language is inspiring to every occasional writer who longs for such skill.  His ability to see through the façades of academic reputation in both public school and university, of nationalistic patriotism, of formally organized religion, and of military tradition overcomes popular perception to show the ignorant, delusional, self-serving nature of such things. Never are his unveilings heavy-handed, though.  On the contrary, Graves depicts events and presents examples in descriptions that he refers to as \\"caricatures,\\" but it would be a dull reader indeed who fails to perceive the ironies implicit in these entertaining recitations.<br />Second, Graves' autobiography is revealing of many historical topics that escape adequate coverage in most textbooks.  The reader comes away with a much improved understanding of early 20th century British society, education, and culture.  Because most of the book deals with Graves' experiences in the trench warfare of World War I, the reader comes to visualize the barbarity and insanity of war more acutely than he may have hitherto done.  Then there are tidbits that generally escape the formal history textbooks altogether-the antipathy between British troops and French citizenry that led some Britons to the conclusion that their country had aligned itself with the wrong side in the war; the imprisonment of British residents of German ancestry resulting from war paranoia (foreshadowing America's treatment of its citizens of Japanese ancestry during the next world war); British soldiers' opinion of American \\"support\\" as American artillery shells showed themselves frequently to be duds or, worse, to fall short and explode in the British trenches rather than the German. Graves presents us history as he saw it first hand, and we are spell bound by his power as a storyteller.<br />The book also has, from my perspective, two significant weaknesses.  First, my command of American English did not always stand me in good stead when confronted by some words and phrases of peculiarly colloquial British usage.  This edition of the book does include a short \\"Glossary for non-British readers,\\" but it needs to be about twice as long for some of us.  The second weakness, more of a disappointment, really, is that the narrative stops when Graves is only thirty-three.  Even though Graves later appended a brief epilogue, the reader wishes that he had continued his story for many more years, for we come to feel a friendship for this man and are enjoying sitting at his knee, listening to him recount his insightful, entertaining, and thought-provoking observations on life-and we do not want the story to end.<br />\\"Good-Bye to All That\\" is well worth the reading to any number of people-aspiring writers (note Graves' style), lovers of poetry (understand the life behind the poetry), and students of history (learn from it or repeat it eternally). In fact, I cannot conceive of any literate person who would not find Graves' autobiographical tale both enjoyable and instructive.ent of its citizens of Japanese ancestry during the next world war); British soldiers' opinion of American \\"support\\" as American artillery shells showed themselves frequently to be duds or, worse, to fall short and explode in the British trenches rather than the German.

The narrator of \\"The Long Walk,\\" Slavomir Rawicz, clearly exhibits an unquenchable hatred for the Soviets and an undisguised disgust for the American and British leaders who allowed the Soviets to occupy and dominate his native land of Poland, to wit: \\"The Poles have suffered more than any other nation through the centuries.\\" \\"Then came Yalta with its humiliating sale of great parts of Europe to the bastardly, inhuman treatment by Stalin, the KGB, and the Moscow-trained puppets and paid stooges....\\"  \\"I lost my home in eastern Poland through the duping of Roosevelt and Churchill at Yalta, where they . . . signed away all of the Eastern Block countries to Russia, thus forcing these countries to follow the dictates of their Russian invaders.\\" Can we trust the truth of a narrative told by one with such emotions?<br />By his own admission as well as comments by Ronald Downing, a British newspaper reporter who wrote down Rawicz's narrative with the help of translating dictionaries, the narrator was never totally fluent in English. Considering the sensationalist types of stories that reporters write to sell newspapers, added to a language barrier, can we trust the reality of this narrative?<br />Can the reader believe that a small band of desperate men and, for part of the trip, a young woman, could actually cross rushing rivers in a Siberian winter without freezing to death? Could stagger across the Gobi Desert without water, surviving on half-cooked snake meat and mud? Could climb the Himalayas without gear or warm clothing? Could stare face to face with the yeti? Can the descriptions of these seemingly impossible feats be believed?<br />\\"The Long Walk\\" is a retold narrative of an incredible escape from a Siberian labor camp and the trek of a tiny band of ill-equipped men and one young woman for thousands of miles through blizzard, across burning desert, and over the highest mountain range on earth to the safety of India.  The story begins in 1939 and ends in 1942. Of the eight people who begin the trek, four end it. Is this a true story as the subtitle says: \\"The True Story of a Trek to Freedom\\"?<br />We must ask ourselves what truth is, what reality is, what accuracy is.

Plus, they are filtered again through the phraseology of a newspaper writer.  Nonetheless, this book succeeds in giving the reader a view of individual daring and suffering during World War II that the dry facts and statistics in high school and college history texts fail miserably to portray.

However, since I did wade through all 666 pages, perhaps a few observations may be permitted.  First, please understand that I came to this book really WANTING to like it.  Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" is one of my favorite novels, one of the very few that I have reread multiple times, and I wanted more of the multi-layered symbolism and dark philosophy of an amoral universe that permeates that wonderful tome.  While I did find a dark tone, that was about it.<br />To enjoy a work of fiction, I must be able to follow Coleridge's admonition to suspend  disbelief; that is, the story and the characters must appear sufficiently realistic that the reader is able to believe that everything COULD have happened just the way the book describes it. However, nearly every event throughout Naslund's book sounds contrived and highly improbable. In several instances, the reader feels that Naslund herself does not understand her characters and is unable to explain their relationships or actions.  For instance, we first are led to believe that Kit's insanity is a logical result of his enforced cannibalism. Later, we feel that it may be a result of Giles' sexual assault.  Finally, we are told that Kit's mother was also insane because she, too, was known to have urinated in public, so now we can conclude that the fellow inherited his insanity.  If all this isn't sufficiently ambiguous, let us examine Kit and Giles' entire relationship, long before the cannibalism business.  Their togetherness certainly leads the reader to conclude that they have long been lovers, yet the shock to Kit of Giles' later sexual domination throws the nature of their entire relationship into question, a question that is never resolved.<br />Many other events come along that make the reader think he has stepped thoroughly into the Twilight Zone. I scarcely think that Una would have felt so comfortable while visiting her new business acquaintance, a washerwoman, only to have Mary strip her down, plunk her into a tub of water, and comment on her body parts! And what is this business of Isaac Starbuck, the  gaoler, all about? He starts out as a Christ-like image, golden haired, good hearted, a literal savior to Pip. He is killed in the fire (we are led to believe), only to rise from the dead and walk among the living again, but never does he play a significant role in relation to Una. He marries, is widowed, and remarries, but never to our heroine. Why is he in the novel? What is his function?<br />Then there's the name-dropping: Margaret Fuller, Emerson, Hawthorne, Alcott, Frederick Douglass, and Henry James all make appearances, but to what purpose the reader is unable to determine. The image of Una's coming upon Hawthorne on a forest path, his face obscured by a black veil, is almost too contrived to be endured. The veil may indeed be intended as a symbol of Hawthorne's dark spirit blocking the beauty of nature, but the symbol is not believable and, thus, fails to convince.<br />Occasionally, themes come close to developing. Una seems to be both fathered and husbanded by lunatics. Nearly every good thing that comes along is followed by disaster, death, loss, hardship. However, Cormac McCarthy's \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" does a much better job of presenting the plight of a humanity that has been damned by the wrath of a vengeful Old Testament god. Una's philosophy of oneness with the universe is clearly expressed near the end of the novel but is reminiscent of Robert Heinlein's \\"We are made of star stuff,\\" thoughts published decades ago. Of her own writings, she says they are \\"but a draft of a draft,\\" directly plagiarizing Melville. And if one wishes to see the source of Naslund's inspiration for the sinking of the whaleship Sussex and subsequent events, read Philbrick's \\"In the Heart of the Sea,\\" a more graphic yet historically factual telling of the disaster.<br />Readers of pulp romances may find Naslund's book fascinating, but its lack of well-developed themes and its population of unbelievable characters engaged in artificially contrived adventures left this reader wanting much more than the novel delivered.ulp romances may find Naslund's book fascinating, but its lack of well-developed themes and its population of unbelievable characters engaged in artificially contrived adventures left this reader wanting much more than the novel delivered.	2004-02-11

Carp's collection of reminiscences by nine former Lionel employees will not acquaint the reader with a comprehensive or chronological history of the company and will add very little to whatever knowledge the reader may already bring concerning the company's products.  Anyone still early in the journey will find Ron Hollander's &quot;All Aboard!  The Story of Joshua Lionel Cowen and His Lionel Train Company&quot; the book to read.<br />Once the reader has the main history of the company under his belt and is familiar with the names of its movers and shakers, then is the time to open Carp's book on \\"the world's greatest toy train maker\\" and to appreciate the experiences of the former employees therein. At its economic height, Lionel was quite a large company and employed workers with many diverse skills.  In Carp's book, the reader will meet assembly line foremen, tool room supervisors, administrative assistants, illustrators, electrical engineers, salesmen, photographers, publicists, and innovators in electronics-all people whose names went unknown to the children who played with Lionel trains and to most other people outside the industry.  Yet these largely unknown and unseen employees all influenced the development, production and marketing of the trains and of Lionel's military products.  Without employees such as those in Carp's book, Lionel could never have achieved the market dominance that it enjoyed for many years, nor would the name carry the fiercely loved emotional reactions that it still evokes among thousands of toy train aficionados and hobbyists today.  In short, Carp's book shows us the Lionel Corporation from the viewpoint of employees who labored in supporting roles rather than in the limelight of the executive boardroom.<br />Reading this collection of memory-lane stories did reveal one proposed product that I had not run across before in any of the other company histories that have been published.  I certainly would like to see a sample of that steam locomotive tender with the chickens popping out of the coal pile pursued by a would-be chicken-catcher!  Reading also revealed one rather significant factual error relative to a Lionel product: Page 99 describes Lionel's Super-O track as having a \\"darkened center rail and ample wood ties.\\"  In reality, the center rail was bright copper, darkening over time only through normal oxidation, and the closely spaced ties were wood-grained plastic. The track used no actual wood whatsoever.  While this is only one error, to be sure, it is a very blatant one, immediately obvious to anyone with common knowledge of Lionel's products.<br />At 112 pages, the book is also a rather thin volume, but it is nonetheless a useful addition to one's library on the Lionel Corporation and is worth the reading-just not as the first book to be read on this topic.ries did reveal one proposed product that I had not run across before in any of the other company histories that have been published.

I make that claim while scanning my bookcase holding 45 books on electric toy trains, the majority of them dealing with Lionel, indisputably the penultimate brand name in America, at least where toy trains are concerned.<br />Hollander writes of the origin and the evolution of Lionel trains from their beginning around 1900 through their status at the commencement of the 21st century, including their near death in 1969 and their miraculous resuscitation by the General Mills cereal company in 1970.  Don't be alienated by the earlier statement that this is a history book.  It is in no way a dry rehashing of facts, dates and dollars such as comprise boring histories. On the contrary, \\"All Aboard!\\" is more of a love story, for Hollander is truly in love with his subject, and his excitement in telling us about the Lionel legend carries the reader through the book on wings of delight.<br />Highly descriptive text leaves us with a wonderful acquaintanceship with Lionel's parent, Joshua Lionel Cohen (who \\"Americanized\\" his name to Cowen), shows us the birth of his baby, draws us word pictures of that baby's successes and failures, its grand leaps of inventiveness and its faltering steps of failure in the changing business and economic climate of a century of American enterprise.  Along the way, we are presented with copious visual reinforcement (both in color and in black and white) of the story that the text is weaving for us.  We see photographs of the movers and shakers of this great company, some of the wondrous trains that they produced, and some of the expert art work that marketed those trains to the boys and fathers (and girls and mothers, too) of 20th century America. That art work, in annual catalogs and in magazine and newspaper advertisements, forged an emotional bond between American youth and the Lionel Corporation that endures today despite changing fortunes and changing ownership.  Its effect on our culture has been phenomenal and is clearly addressed in Hollander's book.<br />I can levy only two criticisms against \\"All Aboard!\\"  The first is that I sometimes find the page layout annoying in that many sidebars and notes are included to give us insights into Lionel's executives, competitors, and plans.  These are valuable and interesting, but they do interrupt the flow of the main text.  The reader must either pause to read the sidebars or else ignore them at first and then return to them later. The second criticism is that the final chapter, which is the only \\"revised and updated\\" part of the book since its original release in 1981, lacks the intimate, revealing analysis that gives the rest of the book its finesse.  The first eight chapters read as though Hollander had been an insider at the Lionel Corporation for its eighty-one years of birth, growth and turmoil, whereas the ninth chapter, which looks at the technological advances in toy trains from 1982 to 2000, is told by an outside observer who is no more privy to corporate thoughts than are the rest of us.<br />If one has already enjoyed the 1981 edition of \\"All Aboard!\\", I cannot recommend purchasing the current edition just to have the new chapter.  On the other hand, if one has never seen either edition of \\"All Aboard!\\", then, no matter what other books he may have read on Lionel trains, he has missed the most definitive and enjoyable book of all, and I cannot recommend Hollander's book too highly.American youth and the Lionel Corporation that endures today despite changing fortunes and changing ownership.

I met Klink Garrett, inspiration and co-author of \\"Ten Turtles to Tucumcari,\\" the other day.  My family had given me a copy of Klink's newly published book for my birthday in December, and the next month Klink was available for book signing at the Western Heritage Center in Spearfish, South Dakota.  After convincing the gate-keeper that I was not there for the Western Christmas show, he let me through with my copy of the book to see Klink, assuring me that he would find me if I infiltrated the show-goers to collect the $10 entry fee.  Klink gladly signed the copy of his book that I thrust at him and bade me sit at his table and talk for a while.  He pulled out another book that he wanted me to see-a looseleaf binder containing dozens and dozens of railroad passes issued to him as an official of the Railway Express Agency by, I think, every railroad in the nation.  I looked on passes issued by the Frisco, the Santa Fe, the Union Pacific, the New York Central, the Pennsy, the Texas and Pacific, the Burlington, the Chicago and Northwestern, the Penn Central, and on and on. I was sitting in front of a man who had a personal acquaintance with railroads that I know only through their published histories and by modern toy trains painted in their images.<br />In \\"Ten Turtles to Tucumcari,\\" Garrett tells the story of his employment with the Railway Express Agency, adding on to that an historical overview of the express industry in America, including REA's several predecessors such as Wells-Fargo and the Pony Express, and how they merged one by one finally to form the preeminent express company in the nation until changing fortunes snuffed out its final breath in 1979.<br />Dry facts and statistics bore me to death, and I fear that, all too often, that's what the word \\"history\\" connotes to students. In this book, however, Garrett gives us the history of one of the most influential businesses in America as he saw it as an employee, first at the grass-roots level and finally at corporate headquarters.  We get to understand the corporate climate of REA by seeing it in action through Garrett's eyes, not by having him lecture us on it.  Of course, quite a few anecdotes of unusual shipments and strange customers appear here and there to really enliven the narrative.  I'll chuckle for a long time over the shipment of Mexican burros that ate one another's destination tags from their necks!  And let's not forget the story of how Klink Garrett got his name-but I'm not going to give that story away here!<br />There will be readers who say that this is nothing but another American autobiography.  You know the genre: Young man works hard, makes good.  It is that indeed, but how else could the Railway Express Agency have become the successful, influential, entrepreneurial company it was had it not been for employees like that young man who worked hard and made good?  Garrett's personal history goes a long way toward explaining the company's success.  Incidentally, this is not a whitewash of the company either, for Garrett's book does not ignore the internal problems that helped bring about REA's demise nor its abysmal sexual and racial bigotry through the 1960's.  I found it to be a quite comprehensive view of the company, especially for being only 172 pages long.<br />If you have an interest in American history, American railroads, the transportation industry, or in stories of young men working hard and making good, you will enjoy \\"Ten Turtles to Tucumcari.\\" I just wish Klink could have told us what was in those lead-lined REA express cars procured for doing business with the Atomic Energy Commission!corporate headquarters.

US	52973885	RB5QXK56VZTOB	0295962038	889708811	The Wolves of Mount McKinley	Books	4	16	16	N	N	More Than the Title Suggests	The title of Murie's book is far too restrictive to represent the full range of its contents.  While the longest single chapter of the book is, indeed, devoted to the habits and ranges of wolves, including their interrelationships with other species inhabiting the huge national park surrounding Mt. McKinley (or Denali, as it is more popularly known in Alaska), other chapters deal with many other animals native to the region.  Among those studied rather intensively are Dall sheep, caribou, moose and fox. Two rather brief chapters give sketches of grizzly bear and golden eagle as well.  A more inclusive title for this study might have been \\"The Fauna of Mount McKinley.\\"<br />  First published in 1944, this book is a record of observations made by an astute naturalist bent upon discovering how the animals live, what they eat, where they range, when they give birth, and, most importantly, how they feed upon one another to maintain a healthy and natural population balance.  Not a few myths about prey and predator are dispelled by Murie's objective observations, which include examining the contents of scats and stomachs.<br />  Murie does not preach environmentalism, but a careful reading of this book should leave the reader with new insights into the natural world and may make him or her just a little more hesitant to intrude destructively into what is actually a highly complex interrelationship among many species inhabiting the few wild spaces left to them.  Murie's approach to his study is highly objective and non-judgmental, however, and another reader could probably come away with insights different from mine.  Still, I can scarcely conceive of any reader's coming away from this book with no new insight of some sort!<br />  If one is particularly intrigued by the great grizzly bear, I recommend that he also read Murie's work entitled \\"The Grizzlies of Mount McKinley,\\" for it goes into far more detail than does the single chapter on grizzlies in this book.  Before investing the purchase price and the reading time in either book, do understand that these are not \\"story books\\" and that they are in no way sentimental or emotive approaches to their subjects.  They are highly descriptive, scantily illustrated with old black and white photos from the early 1940's, and, at times, recite fairly dry statistical observations.  Overall, however, they are well worth the investment by anyone who has an interest in the wild creatures that still inhabit the less-traveled areas of North America.efore investing the purchase price and the reading time in either book, do understand that these are not \\"story books\\" and that they are in no way sentimental or emotive approaches to their subjects.

In multiple ways, then, these are all first impressions.  They also represent the reactions of a reader who was steeped in the conservative Protestant ethic prevalent in the  Bible Belt of the United States, a broad area of the country where the King James Bible is taken as the literal Word of God and is not to be submitted for interpretation, much less translation. Yes, there are many there who fervently believe that every word in the King James Bible is represented precisely as the Christian deity placed it in the minds of the holy ones who set it on paper and that the King James Bible is the only \\"true\\" Bible that has ever existed. Even when one does not subscribe to such a literalist and historically ignorant approach to the contents of the Bible, growing up in such an environment leaves lasting impressions. With this as background, I found Nicolson's work informative and enlightening.<br />Understand that Nicolson's book is not \\"Bible study\\": It does not deal with issues of spirituality; it does not attempt to explicate biblical passages; and it does not care whether or not heaven and hell exist or whether or not God is dead or alive-or has ever existed.  It does deal with the social, cultural, economic, and governmental milieu that existed at the time King James VI of Scotland and I of England directed that a new translation be made of the Greek and Hebrew texts comprising the Bible. It explains why yet another Bible was to be created-in addition to the multiple versions that already existed. It explains why, despite the efforts of six companies of Translators, the world has never enjoyed a totally authentic copy of the King James Bible (think \\"printers' errors,\\" including such egregious mistakes as replacing the name \\"Jesus\\" with the name \\"Judas\\").<br />As do some other reviewers represented here, I feel that Nicolson has perhaps tried to make too strong a case for the power of the language used in the Bible. In this instance and others, he is dealing with highly subjective topics, and I do not always find his arguments persuasive. He is also hampered by the fact that we are now four centuries removed from the events he describes, and much evidence has been lost to the passage of time. Consequently, there is little concrete cause-and-effect in the book and much surmise and supposition. Are Nicolson's conclusions accurate? Alas, the most we can say at this point in history is \\"perhaps.\\"<br />The casual reader also needs to be forewarned that Nicolson's use of language is, at its best, erudite and, at its worst, obfuscated. Have a dictionary handy before plunging into Nicolson's text and be prepared to add to your existing vocabulary because this book can be a learning experience in more ways than one!<br />Is this the best book available on Jacobean society in the early 17th century in England? I have no idea for, as I stated in the beginning, this was my first venture into that particular subject. Is it sometimes challenging reading? Yes. Does its reliance upon conclusions based on subjective interpretations produce frustration in readers hoping for concrete evidence?  Again, yes. Do these weaknesses condemn the book? Definitely not, at least not for a reader newly come to this subject, for there is much here to be learned about the far-reaching theological conflicts between the austere Puritans and the Catholic-influenced Anglicans, about the other versions of the Bible extant when the King James Bible was being written, and about the King himself. And did you know that the King James Bible was NOT the one that the Puritans brought with them to the New World? Nicolson's book will cause many Americans-at least those of us who are products of the Bible Belt-to correct quite a few erroneous assumptions. It isindeed a learning experience and worth the effort to study it.indeed a learning experience and worth the effort to study it.	2003-09-27

Murie's first-hand observations date from 1922 to the 1960s and were made around Denali (the original native name of Mount McKinley).<br />Murie's observations are dispassionate and objective, seemingly free of any bias for or against the great bear (although, at the conclusion, his admiration for the beast and his passionate desire that mankind refrain from &quot;managing&quot; wildlife do emerge). His observations include such topics as bears' range and movement, mating, mother-cub interaction, food habits, and relationship with various types of potential prey such as caribou, moose, Dall sheep, squirrels, marmots and mice.<br />As mentioned, Murie's observations deal only with the grizzlies of interior Alaska around McKinley National Park. He occasionally refers to but does not report on the brown bears of the Alaskan southern coastal areas, although he does accept them as a variety of grizzly (some feel that they are different species or sub-species).<br />Before buying this book, the reader should understand that it is not a &quot;story book&quot; about bears. There is no connected &quot;story line&quot; throughout the book, nor is it a collection of harrowing tales about grizzly attacks on hapless humans. Readers looking for entertainment or excitement should seek elsewhere. However, the book is quite illuminating as to the normal habits of normal grizzlies in their normal environment, and readers who wish to understand the actions (and, dare I say, the thought processes) of these animals will find the book a realistic, down-to-earth resource.  It does not propose any encompassing scientific theories or postulate new hypotheses about grizzlies; it merely reports on how they act, where they roam, and how they live. In the end, this fairly long series of observations is quite effective in painting a very realistic and useful picture of both the grizzlies and, to a lesser extent, of the animals upon which they prey or with which they coexist.<br />There are a few somewhat grainy, black and white photographs reproduced in the book, indicative of the photographic technology available to Murie. Somehow, though, their quality adds to the overall impression of the book as the product of a keen observer of wildlife half a century and more ago. In brief, I found the book interesting and informative, if not exactly a &quot;page-turner,&quot; and it should be useful to those who would become naturalists, who are curious about grizzlies, or who, like me, will always feel somewhat entranced by Alaska, the Last Frontier, and its still-wild creatures.uite effective in painting a very realistic and useful picture of both the grizzlies and, to a lesser extent, of the animals upon which they prey or with which they coexist.<br />There are a few somewhat grainy, black and white photographs reproduced in the book, indicative of the photographic technology available to Murie.

Neither is it a sensational narrative of harrowing accidents, up-set locomotives, or exploded boilers (although O.P. does have a few close scrapes, and the line of rail jacks exploding one after another as his massive 2-10-0 freight locomotive thunders down a track under repair sets the reader on the edge of his chair). No, this book is better than those sorts of books because it brings a man--actually two men--to life.  We come to know O. P. Orr very well indeed through the eyes of his son, the author, John W. Orr, and we end up knowing John as well.<br />This book shows American history as it should be written--giant machines moving the citizens and the commerce of the land, a huge railroad corporation with all the bureaucratic &quot;snafus&quot; of any multi-layered business as those snafus are seen by and sometimes affect the career of an engineman, the impact of the Great Depression on one family as typical of America as any could be. Historical facts are all here, but they are facts as seen by two very real, very human people, a father and a son. Were all history books written so well, we would all understand history far better and read it far more willingly.<br />My own grandfather was an engineman, through his road was the Frisco rather than the Pennsy, and my own father was a great lover of trains, though his career paths took him in a different direction. I came along late in my father's life, and, by the time I had the ability and the leisure to write about him, he was gone and his history with him.  &quot;Set Up Running&quot; is the type of book I wish someone could have written about my own father, and I know of no higher praise than that. This is a book for railroaders, historians, Americans, and every father's child. At the end, I hated to have to say good-bye to O.P.--and to his son John--but I left knowing much more about the first half of 20th Century America, and I really enjoyed the telling.first half of 20th Century America, and I really enjoyed the telling.	2003-04-18

First of all, it is an anthology of four short stories, only one of which is being newly printed. Other than being set on the dragon planet of Pern, the stories have nothing in common, each standing quite apart from the others in its topic.  Every page is adorned with a fanciful border, making for wide margins and short lines of type.  There are also a few full-page illustrations here and there, endearing enough but sparse.  Surprisingly, the book is also printed entirely in a sepia-toned ink (which I thought might be hard on the eyes but actually posed no problems or eye fatigue).<br />Since only one-fourth of the content is newly published and because of the artwork and the unusual ink color, I simply cannot fathom for what audience the book is intended. Junior high school level, perhaps.<br />The four stories are quite fun to read, especially if one hasn't read them recently in their original publications. However, especially with science fiction, I much prefer to become engrossed in the lengthy plot afforded by novel-length books. Short stories always end too soon, jerking the reader out of the fantasy and back into the mundance world of reality just as one is really getting into the story!  Maybe this book is for readers with short attention spans, or maybe McCaffrey is tiring of creating new story lines for the residents of Pern, and this book is analogous to a StarTrek re-run.  Overall, I prefer McCaffrey's earlier full-length novels about this planet and its wonderful, telepathic dragons.	2003-02-21

Most of the accidents deal with the \\"normal\\" string of minor disasters that those who have lived in Alaska are pretty used to: small airplane crashes, small boat sinkings, small raft flippings, and encounters with not-so-small blizzards and bears.  Most of these situations sound like the inventions of uninspired adventure writers except to those who have indeed lived for a time in the state that calls itself The Last Frontier, for we know that such adventures are indeed real life.<br />Kaniut's book is an eclectic collection of such adventures as might appear in glossy magazines such as Sports Illustrated, Shooter, and other such publications whose stories usually involve a vicarious injection of testosterone into the reader.  In fact, it's usually an overload of testosterone that gets the victims into their scrapes to begin with:  \\"Gee, there's a wide, fast-flowing, silt-filled river full of boulders.  Let's see if I can conquer it in my noisy, polluting, totally unnecessary jet boat!\\"  \\"Oh, look! There's a huge, ancient, majestic grizzly boar.  Let's see if I can kill it with my very expensive sport rifle.\\"  The one thing that ties almost all of Kaniut's victims together is their chest-pounding bravado and their insistence on being where they shouldn't when they shouldn't-but that, too, tends to be real life in Alaska, as does the religious fanaticism that a few of the victims display ad nauseam.<br />Don't approach this little anthology looking for universal themes, character development, artfully interwoven plots and subplots, inspiring figures of speech (except maybe hyperbole) or anything at all of a memorable nature.  However, if one is in need of some great outhouse reading material or wants to kill a few hours on the airliner between Anchorage and Seattle, Kaniut's collection of survival tales is the ticket!  Knowing Alaska and its denizens, I have to admit that most of these wild tales may even have happened very much as they are told-with the exception of the giant octopus. That one I'm not buying (even if it does make a great read).s collection of survival tales is the ticket!

Because the stories are all quite recent, most from the 60's and 70's, their narrators are, for the most part, still alive, and Boyer &quot;protects&quot; their identities by refusing to identify any of them; while I am not suggesting that Boyer simply made up any of his book's contents, he just as easily could have done so because all of his sources are anonymous! The stories also vary widely in both topic and interest with little consistency as to either. They range from the highly entertaining (one tells of a young war bride who got to travel with her husband only because a marine gunnery sergeant locked them in a compartment in an admiral's private car) to the very boring (one tells of a man's model railroad, and one is just a list of name trains once viewed by a self-styled &quot;senile citizen&quot;).  The only photographs in the book are those on its cover. There are enough of the highly entertaining stories here to make the book worth reading, but they are interspersed with so many of the very boring variety that the book is in no way a &quot;page turner.&quot; In fact, it took me from Christmas to the 4th day of February to finish its 128 pages of text, an unusually long while!	2003-02-05

It seems as though McCaffrey is struggling to come up with enough story lines to fill a novel and, while she does achieve that goal, she fails to integrate the various stories into a composite whole.  Were this book a student essay, I would have to say that it lacks unity.<br />There are several potentially wonderful narrative themes in the book.  We have the sabotage and vandalism wreaked by the Abominators, who are determined to stop and reverse the many technological innovations initiated by AIVAS, the artificial intelligence system brought by the original colonists and lately rediscovered. We have the huge tsunami generated by the impact of a comet fragment that plunges into Pern's sea and the heroic efforts of the dragons to rescue the land bound holders. We encounter the depredations of the giant felines on the Southern Continent.  Running somewhat weakly through everything else is the angst of the dragonriders who fret about what they will do, now that threadfall is nearly at an end forever.<br />Except for the dragonriders' fretting, which grows quite tedious, any of the story lines could have been detailed and developed into a wonderful novel-length work, but none is pursued to any great depth. Instead, they are strung together like a weakly constructed anthology of unrelated events. This is not to say that the book does not have some delightful high points, both dramatic and humorous. The result of Golanth's first \\"heavy-handed\\" attempts to practice the dragons' newly recognized skill of telekinesis by moving trundlebugs is hilarious. The dialog (dragonlog?) between Golanth and Zaranth is frequently amusing and often touching. The terror and drama of the felines' attack on Golanth, his rider F'lessan, Zaranth, and her rider Tai are well delivered, and the novel becomes a veritable page-turner at that point. Unfortunately, we are then nearing the end of the book and are disappointed that the increased tempo is over so soon.<br />I have enjoyed reading almost all of McCaffrey's books, and I would not have wanted to miss The Skies of Pern. Still, I wish that it had become three different novels, each one dealing with one of great story lines in depth. The fourth line, that of the dragonriders' search for a meaningful existence in the post-thread era, would be better forgotten entirely. Turning them all into astronomers is not precisely a convincing solution to their pending unemployment problem. Still, for its faults and weaknesses, The Skies of Pern deserves to be read by those who have come to know the dragons of Pern. Newcomers to the series, however, will be more pleased to seek out McCaffrey`s earlier works on this fascinating planet.rider Tai are well delivered, and the novel becomes a veritable page-turner at that point.

Do not seek the living horror of an historical shipwreck such as one finds in Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; in any of Forester's novels. Similarly, look elsewhere for the symbolism and multi-layered thoughts that make Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot; such a rich source of inspiration. Forester is by no means an historian, nor can he reach the inspiring heights of Melville as a novelist.<br />Nonetheless, Forester can not only spin an engrossing sea yarn but can also introduce us to young Hornblower in such a way that we really come to know him and look forward to following his career in the Royal Navy. To this landlubber, Forester's familiar use of nautical terminology, especially that which is relevant to the various accoutrements of a sailing ship, causes me mentally to falter from time to time, but the broader contextual meanings of his terms are never lost, and the story line is simply enchanting.<br />Forester's entire collection of novels featuring the trials, tribulations, fears, doubts and successes of Hornblower as he rises from midshipman to lieutenent to captain and on up the hierarchy of officer-dom in the Royal Navy is a grand read for everyone with the least interest in adventure on the high seas. His is more mature reading than, say, &quot;Treasure Island,&quot; but it is nowhere near as &quot;heavy&quot; as the seafaring works of Melville or Conrad. Put quite simply, Forester is fun to read!	2001-07-13

Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea is a truly horror-filled book. Read it only with a strong stomach, for it vividly portrays the unimaginable extremes to which creatures that were once human can go to maintain life. Once the fragile bonds to safety and security are severed by the sinking of their ship, the officers and crew of the whaleship Essex are reduced from civilized humans to elemental creatures not only willing but eager to drink the fresh blood and eat the warm flesh of their fellows to ensure their own survival.<br /><br /> The book's portrayal of total amorality required to preserve one's existence is shared by the portrayal of total hopelessness and unbelievable despair resulting from being set adrift in small boats whose sides rise but a few dismal inches above the devouring sea. Philbrick's incredible descriptive writing draws the reader into the maelstrom of fear and emotional agony afflicting each pitiable, cowering creature groveling in the filthy, salty, undrinkable water in the bottoms of the miniscule boats tossed by the pitiless ocean.<br /><br /> Does their common fate and total helplessness in the face of Nature's uncaring power draw these men together? Let us merely observe that those in the crew who were neither caucasian nor Nantucketer found reason to fear the passing of time. Favoring one's \\"own kind\\" is not a new phenomenon among humans. Does Captain Pollard display the best of leadership for his bereaved sailors? Suffice it to say that, had he not been a classic business textbook example of the \\"Peter Principle\\" at work, a good man who became ineffectual when promoted to a ship's captaincy, the tragedy might never have occurred.<br /><br /> Whether the reader comes to this book seeking true adventure, a psychological picture of men in extreme duress, or a case study in failed leadership, he or she will not be disappointed. The challenge will be to remind oneself that this story is real, for it is the stuff of novels. Were that all history books could be so captivating! This one, at least, can not be put down for long, though the temptation to analyze it as literature rather than as history remains strong--and that's a plus!ory books could be so captivating!

US	52973885	R3HM7OXN4OCJXM	0415921406	416287370	The Routledge Historical Atlas of the American Railroads (Routledge Atlases of American History)	Books	2	33	34	N	Y	A Very Abridged and Superficial &quot;Atlas&quot;	First of all, the title is very misleading.  This is in no way an atlas &quot;of the American Railroads.&quot;  It is at best a superficial sketch book of a FEW American railroads.  Too many major railroads are never mentioned at all.  Of those that are included, historical narrative occupies no more than two pages each.  The &quot;Chronology&quot; section on pages 130 through 133 does not even list the beginning or the completion of the first transcontinental railroad.  The charts on page 127 showing the buy-outs and mergers resulting in today's &quot;big four&quot; roads are woefully incomplete; for example, the Santa Fe is shown as a component of today's BNSF, but all the various roads that were assimilated into the Santa Fe are omitted.<br />Even though the book purports to cover &quot;railroads in the 1990s,&quot; it does not list, map or discuss any of the numerous (and relatively profitable) regional roads that have been created from cast-off routes of the Class 1 roads.<br />For anyone who is at all familiar with the history of American railroading, this book is far too superficial and incomplete to offer much knowledge of any value.  For someone who is ignorant of the subject and wants a solid grounding in it, the book's brevity and many omissions also cause it to be of little value. Perhaps, as another reviewer has already noted, the book would be useful for youthful students learning the techniques of research at elementary or junior high school level.  The information in the book is valid, just not adequately comprehensive for serious, adult research into American railroads.<br />Like the textual material, the maps are useful in visualizing the geographical areas which the included railroads occupied but are not sufficiently detailed to be of much help to an advanced researcher.  They did help this &quot;geographically challenged&quot; reader better grasp the general location of some roads whose names were familiar but whose locations were vague.<br />The concept of the book was potentially excellent.  While most of the well-known railroads in American history have had a plethora of both popular and scholarly books written about them, having one source that would present an abbreviated, chapter-length history of each would have been very handy.  Add to that the recent histories of contemporary regional and short-line roads that have not yet been chronicled and we would have had a very useful addition to the literature on the subject.  In execution, however, this atlas falls far short of the promise of its title. In final conclusion, I am forced to observe that it adds nothing to the extant literature and therefore really has no reason to exist.he concept of the book was potentially excellent.

The fresh, exuberant expression of the Souters' writing continues throughout the book as a look at a paragraph from Chapter 7 attests: \\"Lionel has survived competition, inflation, two world wars, the Great Depression, financial scandal, receivership, rampant nepotism, material shortages, off-shore production experiments, dubious corporate acquisitions, management blunders, marketing blunders, the decline of the railroads, Roy Cohn as CEO, loss of its distribution network, loss of its primary customer base, Sputnik, acquisition by a cereal company, spin-off to a toy company, purchase by a millionaire hobbyist, and the computer chip revolution.  Today, the name Lionel still means `electric train'.\\"<br />  Spicing the book further are enticing glimpses at the competition that Lionel often felt nipping at its heels.  Here and there throughout the book, sidebars pop up to give views of  Carlisle &amp; Finch, Ives, Hafner, American Flyer, Dorfan, Marx, and today's competing brands.  Each of these peeks at the \\"other brand\\" relates that manufacturer's production to the fortunes of Lionel and helps the reader understand Lionel's response to the threat.<br />  The book does have some shortcomings.  It really could have been proofread more closely.  A photo caption describing the introduction of the operating cattle car states that it arrived in 1948 but goes on to say that it was pricey for 1947.  If this weren't confusing enough, the typesetter mistook the year for the price, and the caption actually states that the car \\"was pricey for $1,947 but sold well.\\"  And we thought that today's prices were high!<br />  Another gaffe comes when OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is twice misnamed the Occupational Safety Hazard Administration.  Sharp-eyed readers will also catch other errors such as an occasional misspelled or repeated word.  These are not often frequent or blatant enough to detract greatly from the enjoyment that the book offers, but they do suggest an inferior proofreading effort.<br />  Perhaps some readers will be willing to overlook the affronts upon the language from uncorrected typographical errors; however, they may be less willing to overlook factual errors in the history and description of Lionel's products.  During the discussion of Lionel's brief post-war venture into HO scale trains, the Souters state that \\"Lionel came out with a strange three-rail HO gauge track that was anathema to its primary hobbyist market.\\"  The fact is that Lionel never \\"came out with\\" any such track during the Post War or any other era.  In the late Pre War Period, the company did catalog and sell both two and three-rail track in OO gauge for a brief time.  American OO gauge track is wider than HO and is not compatible with it.  The book is confusing not only two different track gauges but also two different time periods.<br />  Discussion of Lionel's fortunes in 1959 includes a description of the No. 3435 Aquarium Car, part of which reads, \\"Inside, a strip of 35mm clear film with fish painted on it moves past the windows when the activation button is pressed as the car passes over the magnetic track section.\\"  The authors must be terribly impressed with the capabilities of Lionel's remote control track section with its electromagnet to ascribe to it the capability of activating the car's vibrating  motor!  In reality, the car is equipped with an off-on lever to start and stop the motor.  With the lever in the \\"on\\" position, the motor moves the film strip continuously and with total disregard as to whether or not a remote control section of track is even installed on the layout.<br />  While these examples reveal some of the questionable historical research and knowledge of the authors, they are neither so severe nor so numerous as to sentence the book without parole.  There is much that is very good about it: sharp, large photographs of prototypes and their O gauge models; a text that is replete with wonderful turns of phrase that make it a joy to read; an honest willingness to tell all; and the fact that the discussion extends to Lionel's current ownership.  On the other hand, occasional textual errors, some factual discrepancies, and the absence of any citations or bibliographies identifying sources limit the extent to which the reader can trust the material.<br />  Is the Souters' book worth its cover price?  Probably.  After all, who can quibble with the accuracy of these observations from the concluding chapter:<br />  \\"Today's toy train market is driven by an aging population of nostalgia-loving adults who collect and run joyful remembrances of their youth.<br />  \\"Where Lionel will find itself in 2001 and the years to come is a guessing game, but whoever is making the decisions, whoever is designing the products and marketing them has one supreme advantage over all the competition.  They have the name that has come to symbolize durability, value, and imagination for 100 years.  They have the loyalty of fans around the world.

The book  provided an informative, detailed history of Williams Electric Trains,  known earlier as Williams Reproductions, Ltd., established in 1971 to make  reproductions of old, collectible toy trains which were no longer easy to  come by.<br />The book, of course, is no longer a complete history of Williams  Electric Trains, for it predates the company's more recent history as a  marketer of modern O-gauge electric trains (i.e., models in a scale of 1:48  operating on 3-rail track and being compatible with Lionel, K-Line, MTH,  Weaver, and similar brands). However, the book may now be more significant  than ever, for it provides the historical background not only for the  Williams Electric Trains company but also for the MTH Electric Trains  company, one of the largest and most successful marketers of toy electric  trains in the United States today, a formidable competitor of the venerable  Lionel company.<br />You see, one of Jerry Williams' earliest employees was a  high school student named Mike Wolf.  Employment at Williams Reproductions,  Ltd. in the early 1970's gave Wolf his start in the toy electric train  business, and several pages of this book deal with Wolf and another  youthful employee, Andy Edleman.  Wolf went on to found Mike's Train House,  which has evolved into MTH Electric Trains.  And Edleman?  He is now the  Vice President - Marketing at MTH Electric Trains.<br />Even though it is now  13 years old, The Story of Williams Electric Trains is required reading as  &quot;Chapter 1&quot; in the history of not one but two of today's  successful toy train marketers in the U.S.  Any student of the domestic toy  market, of the history of modern-day toys, of electric trains in general,  or of the Williams or MTH electric train companies should have this book in  his library.  Married with the brand new book A Toy Train Story, the  Remarkable History of M.T.H. Electric Trains, Hubbard's work on Williams  will give a fascinating picture into the background of an intriguing and  exciting hobby that has enthralled children and adults of all ages for over  a century.et, of the history of modern-day toys, of electric trains in general,  or of the Williams or MTH electric train companies should have this book in  his library.

While the text gives an adequate overview of the history of Lionel electric  trains, it does not approach the depth and detail that has already been  attained by other authors.  Perhaps it is best compared to a textbook for a  freshman level survey course,  somewhat on the superficial side and with  scant detail but adequate to provide a general understanding of the topic.  While there is a bibliography, there are no citations within the text, so  it is impossible to pursue the author's source for any particular claim or  assertion.  As disturbing as this are textual omissions; for example, while  external socio-economic factors are often cited as causes for the decline  of large-scale electric trains in the late 1950s through the 1960s, other  authors have also called  into question the competency of internal  management once Lionel passed from its founder's control.  Yet, there is no  hint of mismanagement in Ponzol's book, and very few names are named  anywhere in it.  Inasmuch as the book is &quot;officially licensed&quot; by  Lionel, one must wonder whether special pains were taken to avoid any  innuendo or slight where the Lionel name might be  concerned.  Speaking of  omissions, the list of model train clubs in the back omits one of the major  ones, the Lionel Collectors Club of America, while including a listing for  the defunct Lionel Ambassadors Club.<br />The full-color photography occupies  a major portion of the book, with quite a few full-page photos.  Most of  the pictures are of extreme close ups of Lionel locomotives, cars and  accessories chosen to provide examples of the major manufacturing eras of  Lionel trains, i.e., pre war, post war, and modern.  This is not intended  as a photographic inventory of all or even most  Lionel production, and  only a very minute percentage of that production appears.  Many photos  focus sharply on a front corner of the model, allowing everything else to  dissolve into a blurry cloud.  Considering the extensive depth of field  achieved by using a pinhole lens, this blurring must result from a  conscious artistic decision, one that should have been  reconsidered.<br />Better histories are available in Ron Hollander's &quot;All  Aboard!&quot; and in Tom McComus and James Tuohy's six-volume set &quot;A  Collector's Guide and History to Lionel Trains,&quot; although neither  extends to the present day.  The &quot;Collector's Guide&quot; volumes also  contain a fairly comprehensive photographic inventory of Lionel production  through 1980.  However, for those who want an overview of Lionel's history  without committing the time required to study multiple volumes, Ponzol's  book does provide a satisfactory solution packaged in an attractive, well  bound volume.any photos  focus sharply on a front corner of the model, allowing everything else to  dissolve into a blurry cloud.

Who was Casey Jones? How did he really die? How did a child bring death to Engineer Ben Dewberry? Of all railroad disasters, why did the &quot;Wreck of the Old 97&quot; become so well known in song?<br />Lyle spins us stories of the real histories behind two dozen American railroad disasters that spawned folksongs that will not themselves die, though death figures prominently in their stanzas. Having learned most of these songs by heart as a child, Lyle writes this book as a labor of love and makes it the most readable history book in print, imbuing its historical facts with the pathos and the frailty of real humans, whose all-too-human errors occasioned many of the disasters described in these pages.<br />Of course, this is also a song book, and the music and words of the old railroad ballads are woven into each story. The sole disappointment in the book is that it comes to an end. Found by happenstance, it quickly became a cherished addition to my library, though whether to put it with my railroad collection or my folklore collection remains a bit of a question, but that really doesn't matter since it's in my hands much more than it's on the shelf! Readers of railroad folklore and singers of railroad ballads will surely find the lure of Lyle's writing irresistible.<br />Also, while you're browsing here, be sure to check out Norm Cohen's &quot;Long Steel Rail,&quot; a thoroughly researched and scholarly work on railroads in American folksongs. Together, Lyle's book and Cohen's will provide hour upon hour of enjoyable reading to everyone whose interest includes folk music and iron rails!	1998-01-06

While humming &quot;The Wabash Cannonball,&quot; which remains a popular tune even today, have you ever wondered about the phrase &quot;She's the wondrous combination called the Wabash Cannonball&quot;? What in the world does &quot;combination&quot; mean? Apparently, it means nothing more than that someone (who may have been more familiar with songs than with railroads) misunderstood the meaning of the original words and wrote down the wrong word! Does it help to know that a very early version of the song went &quot;She's the bo's [hobos'] accommodation called the Wabash Cannonball&quot;? The train &quot;accommodated&quot; hobos by providing free, albeit unauthorized, transportation and at least temporary shelter from the elements. The song also derives from an even earlier one called &quot;The Great Rock Island Route,&quot; has a number of mythical elements in the style of the Paul Bunyan legends, and speaks of &quot;Daddy Claxton,&quot; who has yet to be identified with any historical character and who appears in other versions as Boston Blackey and even Long Slim Perkins!<br />The evolution of folksongs and their many variants is a fascinating study. Add to this the lure of the railroad, put it all together in a study of dozens of such songs, mix in a healthy dose of scholarly research, and we have Cohen's book. It is not a casual read, but it is invaluable for research into practically every American folksong involving railroads.<br />For everyone interested in the human aspects of railroad history, in railroad folklore, or in the evolution of the American folksong, this book is well worth the purchase price. That it is back in print and again readily available is a godsend to folklorists, musicologists, and railfans. If you missed the first printing, don't miss this one!
