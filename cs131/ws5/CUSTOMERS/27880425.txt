This is NOT wicca or any other type of new age fluff bunny garbage, this is witchcraft. There are many workings contained in this volume which are taken and or adapted from Mexican folk practice. If you r afraid to get your hands dirty or if your hung up on some eastern karmic ideas then this is not the book for you.	2005-03-16

I was interested to find out That it was written by a Catholic priest like one reviewer stated though the author neglected to put this on the cover.

This book is written from the perspective of the bokor, the sorcerer in VooDoo. There are no trappings of karma here. This is a book for those who wich to work with certain spirits of VooDoo in a certain way. Many of the seals, not veve, but seals in this book are Macumba, not Haitian VooDoo. Eshu is worked with here in place of Papa Legba or Elegua. There is a good chaper on shell divination with details on learning it and constructing your own divination tray which do use the veve. I think the authors chose their title well as this work is not to be confused with Haitian VooDoo in pretty much any way.	2005-02-20

I also was happy to see a book like this on the market. Im not a big fan of Llewyllyn publications finding most of their stuff kinda fluffy, but this book seemed to be about something so I bought it. Its nice to see a book about Michael out of the strictly christian context. This book contains wisdom about Michael which can be utalized by most anyone in any faith. Saint Micael is viewed as a powerfull Amparo, a protector in Curanderisimo and Latino Folk religion. Bringing this powerfull Santo to more people is a blessing. Check it out, its worth the cover price which I have to say is quite reasonable.	2005-02-19

This book will not only expand on the vast ammount of information in the deck's book but will provide the reader with wisdom from both the Loa and Orisha. If you are someone interested in learning more about VooDoo as practiced in New Orleans the check out this book. The illustrations of each card speak to the soul.

I bought it a couple of years ago and have read it a few times.

The second part however is much more interesting giving a very vivid description of a botanica, elekes, warriors, and more. I would suggest buying this book for reference but also taking it with a grain of salt, dont believe everything you read.	2005-02-04

The book has a small section on Palo Mayombe. The author describes Palo as being evil and calls it \\"the dark side of santeria\\". This is not correct at all. Palo Mayombe, Palo Monte, Palo in general is totaly different and seperate from Santeria. There are spirits in Santeria and Spirits in Palo. Palo Mayombe is hardly anything like the information presented in this book. The Other thing to watch out for is her description of Orisha as Gods. Orisha are not gods, In santeria there is one God. The orisha are spirits who live on this earth with those who are initiated in santeria. Be careful when reading this book, use it as a tool to help you get some basic information but take it witah a grain of salt.	2004-12-06

I used to own bothe the Rider Waite and Universal Waite decks but I like this one much more than those. The Rider Waite tarot is very bland in its coloring and the black outlines on the cards stands out more than the images. In the Universal Waite deck the colors are softer, not bland, but almost too soft. It has a better feel to it than the Rider version but still something is missing. Finally a little over three years ago I had the oppertunity to take a tarot class and we needed one of these Waite decks. I decided to buy the Albano Waite tarot and was thrilled. Many people have tropble with the colors describing them as being sort of technicolored but I feel the colors help the reader understand more than just the surface picture, they seem to help one channel the information more clearly. Of course every reader is different and this is just what works for me. I hope you will consider this particular version of a long standing deck when you are looking for one that works for you.	2004-12-01

I ordered it used and am sort of glad that I did. To begin with, the author writes in sort of an obnoxious way. About every 5 sentences or so he uses the phrase \\"according to one source\\". That gets a little old after the first chapter, Im not kidding he actually uses this like every 5 sentences. Add to that the author seems to have a somewhat negative view of Santeria. He wrote this book about Curanderismo and mexican folk practices and sort of makes a comparrison that curanderismo is good and santeria is bad. He also calls Brujeria black magic. I think the author needs to do some better research before he writes these things. I will say that the actual herbal section is pretty well researched and has some usefull information. All things considered buy this one used, it's not worth full price.	2004-11-24

Each date is supposedly supposed to hold some meaningfull thing which the reader can reflect on but many many many of the enteries were secular and innane.

I must admit that some oif the material seems a bit off and theres a bit too much wiccan flair to this work but I think the author did this to open Guadalupe's message to a larger group. Brujeria is not wiccan under any circumstance and should not be construed as such. Guadalupe is Mary, she is not an archetype of the wiccan goddess. If you wish to learn about this beautiful and peacefull pure woman then read a book dedicated to her. I have loved and cherished my copy for years and will continue to do so always.

I have to say that books on subjects like this are generally filled with a lot of misinformation. This book is a bit better than the rest. Baba Raul Carizares has presented a work filled with information about Palo Monte. He makes the distinction however that Palo Monte and Palo Mayombe are like light and dark. I had to disagree with that distinction, neither is light nor dark. All in all this is a pretty good work. I recocmend this one over the others on the subject.	2004-11-17

This book only contains parts of ceremonies and prayers and then refers to other texts for the complete ceremony. I did like certain parts of this text but all in all it really lacks the information which the title boasts. If you are looking for a true ceremonial then buy The Rites vol. 2  that particular text has most of the complete ceremonies which the ceremonial of bishops begins. The Rites vol 2 also costs half of this one.	2004-11-06

I especialy enjoyed reading in black and white the proper placement of the tabernacle and the rules on saying mass. So many priests ignore the proper ways and opt for keeping taberbacles in seperate chapels and use glass chalices. The ceremonies of the modern roman rite detail guidelines for liturgical colors, linens, vessels and vestments, the altar, the church, and much more. What i found lacking is the ceremonies themselves, It contains rituals which are reference only, incomplete. Just like the ceremonial of bishops, this book will give an outline for a ritual but refer to other texts for the complete ceremony. I reccomend The Rites vol 2 if you want actual rites and rituals. All in all this book is worth the price, though personally I would rather the american curch follow Rome more closley and leave the modern stuff to the protestants.	2004-11-06

I have an older printing with a different cover so Im not sure if the new edition is any different. I really enjoy the author's style in writing and his material seems well researched.

I am thankfull that this resource is available and is being used. Too many priests, when asked to bless something ignore these approved rites and opt to simply make the sign of the cross over whatever it is they are blessing.

One reviewer wrote in about astrology being against the teaching of Jesus. Reader's take note, this is not a christian book. This is a Marian book, about Mary, for Mary. Many people see the Blessed Virgin as Goddess, not simply the mother of christ. This book will take you through the apparitions of Mary at Lourdes, Fatima, and many others. I feel that with this work, Llewyllyn Publications is finally printing things worth while instead of the same old dribble over and over again under a different title. If you are a follower of Mary and want to experience her in your life to the fullest then buy this book, while it won't be an end all do all say all complete guide to this Blessed Goddess it will assist you on your journey.

The cover caught my eye so I decided to read it. I have to say that I was more impressed with the cover than I was with the content of the book. The author gives an over abundance of charts and correspondance tables and not really any information which hasn't already been discussed in other books. The author also appears to have taken some correspondance tables from another book called THE HANDBOOK OF YOUROBA RELIGOUS CONCEPTS by Baba Ifa Karade and did not credit Baba Karade in his bibliography. I gave this book three stars because it seems to present some information which someone interested in Santeria might find usefull but once one moves beyond mere interest this book is obsolete.	2004-10-18
