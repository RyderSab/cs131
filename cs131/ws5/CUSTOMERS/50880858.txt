Without a doubt, intercessory prayer is the work of all true saints of God (1 Timothy 2:1-8).  The Bible is clear on the power of prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; 21:22; Luke 18:1-8).  However far too many Christians don't understand just how powerful our prayers can be.  We alone contain the truth of God (John 14:6).  We alone contain the true Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:16-21).  And yet cults and other world religions often shame us in their zeal and in their dedication to prayer (Matthew 6:7,8).<br /><br />Sheets' book outlines just what is intercessory prayer.  I found it to be helpful in showing us in Scripture the power of prayer in the lives of other believers.  My only drawback to the book was the heavy emphasis upon experience.  Prayer is an experience but it is not so much how we feel or what we see but our faith in God and what He can do through our prayers (Mark 11:22).  Being devoted to prayer (Colossians 4:2) does not always mean I feel like praying but I pray because I am a disciple of Jesus (Luke 11:1) and I want to be just like Him in all that I do (1 John 2:6).<br /><br />I can endorse this book and recommend other Christians to read it.  Always read a book with your Bible open and your heart set on pleasing the Lord.	2005-09-21

Carson offers a fair, balanced and biblical review of the emerging church movement which is fastly changing the scope of American Christianity (and I believe for the worst).  Carson opens his book with a careful review of the movement by allowing the various authors and teachers of the movement to share their thoughts in their own words.  Carson has numerous footnotes to help the reader see where the quotes are coming from.<br /><br />The book is quite loving in its approach.  Dr. Carson does not seek to tear down the emerging movement but he does seek to expose both its strengths and weaknesses.  He does this with much grace.  Dr. Carson is not blind to what the emerging church movement can teach the evangelical church but he does not hesitate to point out where the movement falls short by testing it with the Word of God.  Truth, writes Carson, is not optional nor is it fuzzy.  Truth comes directly from God and it contained in the Bible.  Everything must conform itself to the Scriptures or it will not stand at all.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this work.  Having read much of emerging church authors and visiting various emerging web-sites, I found Carson's work to be a prophetic voice in our age.  I highly recommend this work to every disciple of Jesus.	2005-09-11

If you are looking for a devotional type Bible commentary with expository outlines then look no further than John Phillips commentaries.  This series of books are full of practical, devotional, and expository thoughts and outlines on each chapter and verse of the book that Phillips is dealing with.<br /><br />This commentary is on the book of Revelation.  Revelation is one of the most covered books of the New Testament with more commentaries devoted to this book than any other NT book.  A quick search on Amazon will reveal the depth of biblical commentaries that have been written about Revelation.  Phillips' commentary is unique in that the expository outlines make it worth price no matter where you find yourself viewing the book of Revelation.<br /><br />Phillips' view is that a futurist viewpoint.  He is also premillineial and pre-tribulation in his views.  This does affect his writing of the book of Revelation but any true disciple of Jesus will enjoy this commentary.  I highly recommend it especially for Bible teachers.	2005-09-03

Theologians such as Clark Pinnock and Gregory Boyd have added fuel to the fire through their books that support what they deem \\"an evangelical but biblical view of God\\" (Boyd).<br /><br />In this work, GOD UNDER FIRE, leading evangelical scholars take aim at the Open God viewpoint.  The book is deals with the subject of the doctrine of God.  Each chapter focuses on the different attributes of God that are under fire by open deist.  From the historic view of God to the unchanging nature of God (immutability).  Each chapter is quite well written with many Scriptures to back the writers point.  Each writer has many endnotes and includes the open view before building their own case from the Bible.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful book to read about the glory of the biblical God.  As we move closer to the end of time more and more will arise to question our God (2 Peter 3:1-9).  False prophets have always been around (1 John 4:1-2).  We must stand firm for biblical truth (Jude 3-4) and stay grounded in the Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17).  Only by remaining committed to the Bible do we find true security (John 8:31-32; James 1:21; 1 John 2:28).	2005-08-28

The writers tell their stories of not losing faith in God while losing faith in the modern church.  The stories range from bizarre trails to simply being influenced by such emergence leaders as Brian McLaren to former PTL's son Jay Bakker.<br /><br />The positives of this book are:<br /><br />- A good division of the book.  Editor Mike Yaconelli did a good job of breaking the book into divisions such as stories of ministry crisis, stories of worldview crisis, and stories of faith crisis.<br /><br />- Short, fast paced stories.  The stories are not boring to read (even if you disagree with them).  They move quickly and each writer does a good job of staying focused on their subject.<br /><br />- Issues that the Church must address.  The book does present several key issues that we must present from the Bible.  Only Scripture can help us to work through the problems of modern modernity.<br /><br />Problems with the book:<br /><br />- Lack of theological substance.  While the book is a book of stories, the book lacks Scripture.  In fact, the authority of the Bible is never addressed.  The emergence movement seems to want to throw Scripture out the window and yet still be Christians.  How can this be?  The Bible is where we learn about Jesus (John 20:31) and the Bible alone is the truth (John 17:17).  The stories lacked truth.  They were filled with common themes of experience (\\"I don't like the church because of this\\") but no biblical proof.<br /><br />- Too experience driven.  Feeding off the above, the emergence movement seems to be more about common experiences and not sound doctrine.  However, experience must flow from Scripture (1 Timothy 4:16; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:16-22) lest we be deceived (1 John 4:1-2).  Experience is no basis for truth.  Only the Bible is able to save our souls (James 1:21).  As a disciple of Jesus, I must hold to His word (John 8:31-32).<br /><br />- Shallow view of sin.  From homosexuals to drugs, the emergence movement has a shallow view of sin.  In fact Mike Yaconelli admits that he has spoken about sin in the Church only twice in 12 years (p.18)!  The book even says that homosexuality might not be a sin (pp.30-31).  How did they embrace this world-view?  Not from Scripture (1 Cor. 6:9-11; Rev. 21:8)!  This is what happens when the Bible is not your authority.  How do we expose man's need for Jesus without first addressing our depraved nature?<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />The emergence movement has grown out of the seeker movement which has come from the charismatic movement which came from the Pentecostal movement.  What do all these movements have in common?  Experience as the basis for fellowship.  If anyone tries to critique the movements based on the Word of God, they are often viewed as a Pharisee or a Puritan.  I for one believe we need to hold firmly to the Bible despite our changing culture.  God does not change (Numbers 23:19; Malachi 2:10) and neither does His Word (Psalm 119:89).  I will not embrace the philosophies of Hume or Blaine over the Word of God but if I did then I would be heading down the emergence movement road.eding off the above, the emergence movement seems to be more about common experiences and not sound doctrine.

The articles are essentially the notes and the talks given by the various teachers of the seminars.<br /><br />The book itself is an eye-opener and calls the believer to discernment in an age of careless theology (and no theology at all in most churches).  The book deals with nearly every hot issue of the evangelical church from Rick Warren's popular but misleading Purpose-Driven ministry to the modern feminist movement.  The book deals with music issues, church discipline, and a host of other local ministry issues.  Nothing is left untouched.<br /><br />Dr. John MacArthur and his staff at Grace Community Church, The Master's College and Seminary, and Grace To You are to be commended for giving the Church this book.  Truly, the modern Church is looking for God but finding fool's gold.  Only by a return to the authority of Scripture will we truly find God's blessing.	2005-08-27

However, even this Arminian sat and enjoyed reading Dr. R.C. Sproul's book on the history of free will.  While I could see that Dr. Sproul was no doubt leaning toward the Calvinist position (he is a Reformed theologian), I still enjoyed the makeup of the book and even Sproul's analysis of the differing views.<br /><br />The book begins by laying out before the reader the debate at hand.  For those not familiar the debate centers around the issue of Man's free will.  Does a man have the freedom to hear the gospel and choose to become a disciple of Jesus or does it begin with divine election and the drawing of the Holy Spirit that is irresitable (Acts 13:48; Romans 9-11)?  Do we choose first or does God choose us first before time begin?  Can anyone reject the gospel by their own will?<br /><br />From there Sproul takes his readers throughout history with others who have this debate from Augustine to Martin Luther to John Calvin to Jacob (or James) Arminius to John Wesley and others.  The reader will find these interesting to read.  Sproul gives his opinion here and there but overall he tries to avoid being too bias.  I think he does a good job of doing this.<br /><br />This book is useful not only to the avid student of Church History but for the average reader just wanting to see how Christians have debated the issue of free will and sovereign election.<br /><br />For more on election, free will, and salvation from an Arminian viewpoint see:<br /><br />Robert Picirilli, GRACE, FAITH, AND FREE WILL<br /><br />Dan Corner, THE CONDITIONAL SECURITY OF THE BELIEVER<br /><br />Roger Forester, GOD'S STRATEGY IN HUMAN HISTORY	2005-08-27

This is not a politically correct book about Islam.  Spencer writes about the history of Islam that most Muslims wish outsiders never knew.  While the history is well documented with tons of end notes and is not hidden in Islamic nations, the politically correct media in the West doesn't want us to know the truth.  Thanks to Robert Spencer we now have a guide to the true history of this dangerous religion of Islam.<br /><br />A quick review of my own reviews will show that I am a deeply devoted disciple of Jesus Christ.  Almost all of my own reviews come from Christian books and Christian theology.  Being a disciple of Jesus, I am well aware of the differences between Christianity and Islam, between the Bible and the Koran, and between Jesus and Mohammed but reading this book brought a new perspective about the history of Islam.  To see Mohammed as he truly was is quite a shock to the Western mind.<br /><br />While President Bush and the US media tries to say that Islam is a religion of peace, by reading books such as this one will allow you to see through the smoke screen at the truth of this deadly religion.<br /><br />For more about Christianity and Islam see [...] as well as the book ANSWERING ISLAM by Norman Geisler.	2005-08-26

The story is engaging and will keep you flipping page after page as you read the true story of Spencer.<br /><br />My only reason for not giving this book five stars is simply that some (not all) of the material on Mormonism is dated.  The book was written in 1984 so many changes have taken place since that time in apologetics in both the Church of God and the Mormons themselves.  While their theology has not changed, their methods have.  Mormons tend to want to be more \\"mainline\\" now and seek to avoid debates with Christian theologians.  Even their language is changing (see Robinson's ARE MORMONS CHRISTIANS? and White's IS THE MORMON MY BROTHER?).<br /><br />Overall this book is well worth getting, reading, and then passing it on to other disciples.  Mormons will avoid the book simply because of the title (2 Cor. 4:3-4).  I urge Christians to pray earnestly for Mormons to be saved (Romans 10:1-2; 1 Timothy 2:1-8).  I also believe we need to study Mormonism to know how to combat their false teachings (1 Peter 3:15-16) and this is a good book to start with.	2005-08-20

I recently started listening to PEOPLE TO PEOPLE while driving home from work.  I had heard of Bob George and had even met some of his followers.  From debates I had had with my George friends, I knew that Bob George was very \\"graceful\\" and that he tended to view any acts of obedience as \\"legalism.\\"  Having listened to George I decided to purchase this book, his classic work, to see what Bob George and People to People ministries believe.<br /><br />Let me first start with the positives.  I appreciated how Bob George places great emphasis on Scripture and on the Lord Jesus Christ.  George wants his readers to know that he wants to be biblical and yet glorify Jesus in all that he does.  This was to be applauded.<br /><br />Secondly, I appreciated George's emphasis on salvation being not by the works of men but by God.  Our righteous acts can not merit our salvation (Isaiah 64:6; Romans 3:22-25; 6:23).<br /><br />Thirdly, I appreciated George's emphasis on the cross of Christ as the completed work that provides salvation from the power of sin.  I also was grateful for his emphasis on the life of Jesus that now abides in us by the indwelling Holy Spirit.  The only way we can live the victorious life is by trusting in the Holy Spirit to lead us (Galatians 5:16-17).<br /><br />The Negatives:<br /><br />First of all is the unbiblical view of grace that George gives.  God's grace is not given to the disciple so that the disciple can just live in sin.  Rather grace teaches us to say \\"no\\" to sin (Titus 2:11-14).  Cheap grace is what George teaches in CLASSIC CHRISTIANITY.<br /><br />Secondly, no-where does George write about repentance or the need to repent (Luke 13:5; 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 17:30; Romans 2:4; 2 Cor. 7:10; 2 Peter 3:9).  In fact, George seems to believe in the shallow salvation of non-Lordship teachers such as Charles Stanley, Zane Hodges, or Charles Ryrie.  He never talks about the need to take up our crosses and follow Jesus (Luke 9:23-25) or counting the cost for salvation (Luke 14:25-35). He never writes about the need to be baptized to demonstrate our faith in Jesus (Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 16:30-34; 18:8; 19:5; 22:16; Romans 6:1-4; Gal. 3:27-28; 1 Peter 3:21-22).  Instead George teaches the unbiblical sinner's prayer and the \\"faith alone\\" doctrine (James 2:14-26).<br /><br />Thirdly, George advocates eternal security by saying that the power of sin has been done away with once and for all through the work of Jesus Christ.  He says that all our sins are forgiven in Jesus.  However, why should the disciple pray Matthew 6:12-13 or 1 John 1:9 if the power of sin has been done away with?  Why would Satan tempt us into sin if sin has no power over us?  Why would Paul urge his readers to avoid sin at all cost (1 Cor. 9:24-10:21) if sin has no power?  Why would Jesus even advocate cutting off our arms and legs and plucking out our eyes to avoid sin and thus avoid hell if sin has no power over us (Matthew 5:29-30)?  Why would the NT urge perseverance of the saints if \\"once saved, always saved\\" were true?<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />CLASSIC CHRISTIANITY is not classic Christianity but endorses carnal Christianity.  It allows sin to continue in the life of the disciple without warning the disciple that sin will rob them of eternal life (Romans 6:23; Galatians 6:7-9).  Mark my words, Revelation 21:6-8 still applies today.  We must not turn God's grace into a license to sin (Jude 3-4) but we must keep our faith in Jesus until the very end (2 Cor. 11:2-4).<br /><br />For more on true grace teaching see:<br /><br />MacArthur, John THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS<br /><br />Conner, Dan THE CONDITIONAL SECURITY OF THE BELIEVERounting the cost for salvation (Luke 14:25-35).

Fraser shows the illogical and often historical errors of Smith's book.  He shows that while the Bible contains ample amounts of evidence to support it, the Book of Mormon is a book that many Mormons must simply \\"take by faith\\" or experience a burning in the bosom as Moriah 10:4 promises.<br /><br />My only reason for not giving the book a five star rating is that the material is dated.  Many more books have been published since this book first appeared in 1978 on the subject of Mormonism.  Further, Mormons have changed their own apolgetic tactics.  Mormons are trying to become more indentified with mainline Christianity rather than against the established church.  The book's arguments (while valid) often would not fly with today's Mormons since most don't want to argue but would rather be \\"brothers in Christ.\\"<br /><br />However, Fraser's book is very resourceful for the disciple to know more about Mormonism.  1 Peter 3:15 and Jude 3 tells us to stand firm for the faith that was once for all given to the saints.  Let us stand firm against the darkness of Mormonism and seek to make disciples of Jesus from among the Mormons.  Fraser's book (and many others) is a good place for that journey to begin.	2005-08-08

Like a breath of fresh air, Sproul shows us from Scripture the awesome power of God to accomplish His purposes in the earth.  Sproul uses various texts from both the Old and New Testament to reveal the biblical picture of a God who is in control of all things even when it doesn't seem that He is.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed how Sproul stayed true to the Bible as his authority.  While he does quote from other authors and from the Westminister Confession of Faith, Sproul does not get bogged down in the heated debate between the Calvinist and Arminian over God's sovereignty.  He simply shows from Scripture that God is in control.  No-one can argue with that.<br /><br />In the end, I greatly enjoyed this book.  While it read like a devotional, the book lifted my faith in the absolute power of God.  Romans 8:28 hasn't been more precious since I finished this book.  You too will enjoy this book as you study the Scriptures concerning the hand of God's providence in all things.  You will pray to your Father knowing that He is sovereign (Matthew 6:8).	2005-07-31

In fact, few writers can touch a saints heart like E.M. Bounds.  His words (while over 100 years old) are still full of truth.  Without a doubt Bounds writes as a man with a passion for Jesus Christ who knows that power truly only comes through prayer.<br /><br />In our \\"modern\\" era it is often the duty of leaders in the church to look more like business CEO's rather than biblical servants of Christ.  Churches \\"hire\\" men based on their resumes rather than their brokeness and their humility nor are they much concerned with their prayer lives.  Bounds attacks this false Christianity head on.  He shows that power comes through prayer.  Much head knowledge is no substitute, says Bounds, to a dynamic prayer life.

(Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library)	Books	4	8	15	N	N	Pre-Tribulation Arguments for the Rapture	Dr. Tim LaHaye has done more to put the pre-tribulation view of the rapture into print then any other writer in modern times.  His popular LEFT BEHIND series has sparked even movies and much debate in the Church about the timing of the rapture or even if the rapture is biblical.<br /><br />In this work, LaHaye takes his opponents to task.  He seeks to provide both biblical and historical arguments for the pre-tribulation rapture view.  He does this by examining both the arguments for this view as well as the arguments of those who oppose his views.<br /><br />What I found lacking about the book was the lack of biblical arguments LaHaye gives.  He spends too much time examining the historical debate and not the Scriptures themselves.  I believe LaHaye could almost end the rapture debate by staying in the Scriptures and building his case there.  The Bible alone is the only solid foundation for truth (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:19-21).	2005-07-26

The book deals with conditional passages of Scripture from the Old Testament to the end of the New Testament and Dr. Arrington also deals with popular Calvinist passages that seem to teach eternal security.<br /><br />Dr. Arrington makes no apology that he is Arminian in his approach to the doctrine of eternal security.  He wrote the book to help Arminians understand what the Bible teaches about persevereance of the saints.  This indeed is a good edition to the subject of the security of the believer.	2005-07-24

As the Pentecostal movement continues to grow and influence modern Christianty, the movement itself is beginning to debate the work of the Spirit in particular the baptism in the Holy Spirit with the initial, physical evidence of speaking in other tongues.  This book adds to that debate.<br /><br />The book is a short book (188 pages) on the Holy Spirit and gives a classical Pentecostal view of the Spirit's work in the life of the believer.  The book covers the personality of the Spirit including His deity and His work in the Biblical history.  The book further dives into the work of the Spirit in the Church both doctrinally and by experience (entire sanctification and Spirit-baptism).<br /><br />Overall I thought the book was well written and was a good overview of the Holy Spirit's work.  Evangelicals will find no problems with the book other than the baptism of the Spirit and possibly the slight emphasis on sanctification as a second work of grace (Wesleyan).  My only negative for the book is that it was a short work although Rhea states that his work is for the average Christian and not the scholar alone.	2005-07-03

When we truly know who God is and His unlimited power, writes Dr. Mayhue, then we begin to see the power of crying out to Jesus.

The author is a former Muslim from Saudi Arabia and so he offers personal insider information into the history of both Islam and the Koran.  Elass shows how the Koran became the book it is today within Islam and yet he also does a good job of comparing the two religions side by side.<br /><br />This book is written for Christians.  It is not written to give to your Muslim friends or neighbors.  In fact, the book gives to me a brief overview of Islam.  The drawback on this book is that it could not cover the radical differences between Christianity and Islam.  So while a simple an easy to read book on the Koran, I myself would prefer to see Mr. Elass come out with a scholarly work showing the errors of Islam and why Jesus is the only way to the Father (John 14:6).	2005-07-03

I thought it would be an excellent class to attend on how to share my faith and make disciples.  However, I was soon greatly dissappointed as I saw the shallowness of the method and the unbiblical gospel that it presents.<br /><br />The book is designed to help Christians communicate the gospel to non-Christians.  The book encourages the Christian to ask a series of questions such as, \\"If you were to die today and stand before God and He should ask you why He should let you into His heaven what would you say?\\"  The questions are to get the non-Christian thinking about death and judgement to come (Hebrews 9:27-28).<br /><br />The problems with EE are too many to explain in this short review.  First, the gospel message presented lacks power (Romans 1:16) and says little to nothing about repentance and baptism which are both biblical parts of the gospel (Luke 13:5; 24:47; Acts 2:38; Romans 2:4; 6:1-4; 1 Peter 3:21-22).  It says nothing about discipleship (Matt. 28:19-20; John 8:31-32).<br /><br />Second, EE never deals with the very heart of man.  It never uses the Law to show man their sinfulness before a holy God (Psalm 19:7; Romans 7:7; 1 Timothy 1:8-10).  The Law, writes Paul in Galatians 3:19-27, is out school master to bring us to Christ.<br /><br />Third, EE never speaks about the need to perservere in the faith (Luke 8:15; Acts 14:22-23; Romans 11:20-22; 1 Cor. 9:24-10:21; Gal. 3:1-4; 5:1-4; 6:7-9; Php. 2:12-15; Col. 1:21-23; Hebrews 2:1-4; 3:6-19; 4:1-12; 5:8-9; 6:1-20; 10:19-39; 11:13-16; 12:1-39; 1 John 2:3-6; 3:6-9; Rev. 21:7-8). Even the Reformed movement believes that one must perservere until the end to be saved (Matt. 24:12). This is not clerely shown in EE.<br /><br />I would recommend instead of EE using the books of Ray Comfort or Douglas Jacoby.	2005-07-02

The two movements (Wesleyan-Holiness & Pentecostal) are so closely related that the early Pentecostals actually used Nazarene theology books and other Wesleyan texts for their Bible training (see Donald Dayton's THE THEOLOGICAL ROOTS OF PENTECOSTALISM).  However, the Nazarenes and other Wesleyan-Holiness groups quickly distanced themselves from the early Pentecostals and even becoming some of the Pentecostals biggest persecutors.<br /><br />This excellent work by Mark Quanstrom is a well researched and theological look at the changing of the teaching of the doctrine of entire sanctification.  Quanstrom shows how the early Nazarenes taught and practiced the doctrine versus modern Nazarenes.  Sadly, with time many Nazarenes have dropped much of their distinctive doctrines such as entire sanctification and Spirit-Baptism language for more evangelical terms.  Further, many have moved away from their historical roots based strongly on Wesley and Arminian teachings toward more Calvinistic and progressive sanctification views.<br /><br />A well thought out, well researched, well written overview of Nazarene theology over the past 100 years.	2005-06-07

Dr. Murray leaves no stone unturned in his examine.

I have not always agreed with them 100% of the time but I have found their passion for practical holiness in every area of their lives a relief in the midst of our sinful generation (1 Peter 1:15-16).  However, anyone who has read the Puritans knows that their theology and language can be deep and tough to work through.<br /><br />Thankfully we have books such as this work from Kris Lundgaard.  He takes the powerful writings of John Owen and brings them into the 21st century.  No he doesn't change Owen's theology but only his language.  In fact, Lundgaard jokes that he has kidnapped Owen and they co-wrote the book.<br /><br />The book itself is an excellent Puritan and Reformed view of sin in the life of the saint.  We all know that 1 John 1:9 is precious to each of us whether we are strong Reformed Calvinist or Arminians.  Lundgaard (and John Owen) help us to see the destruction of sin on the cross of Jesus Christ (Hebrews 10:10) and that we have the power by God's grace and God's Spirit to overcome our sin.  We don't have to struggle with our flesh but we can have victory through the power of the cross (Gal. 2:20).  I highly recommend this book for all disciples of Jesus Christ.	2005-05-02

His sermons, his articles, his teachings, his preachings - all have a fire in them from God.  Dr. Brown, while very educated, has a true desire to see the Messiah exalted and to see the world full of the glory of God.<br /><br />This book was written during the height of the Brownsville Assembly of God revival in Pensacola, Florida.  The book was written after Hank Hanegraaff's book COUNTERFEIT REVIVAL came out blasting the Toronto \\"blessing\\", the laughter movement, and Brownsville (although the church is not mentioned in the first edition of the book).  The critics were growing against Brownsville and so Dr. Brown wrote this book.<br /><br />The book is a defense of practices of Brownsville and other 20th century revivalist.  From shaking to holy laughter to other physical manifestations.  Dr. Brown does a search of Scripture and uses church history to show that such manifestations have been common in most revivals of the past.  Why not the present?<br /><br />I enjoy Dr. Brown's books and the man is a scholar.  However, this book didn't do much for me.  The use of Scripture and church history were flawed and biased in my opinion.  Dr. Brown is passionate for God's presence (as am I) so he defended even the most bizarre simply to keep \\"revival\\" as he and others at Brownsville saw it.  The \\"revival\\" was short lived and is now history itself.  Many of those \\"touched\\" by God during the revival that I personally know have fallen away (Matthew 13:20-21).  It is only those who love the truth who are truly saved (John 8:31-32; 2 Thess. 2:10; James 2:14-26).  Even Dr. Brown will concur with that.<br /><br />For an alternative view see Iain Murray's two books PENTECOST TODAY? and REVIVAL AND REVIVALISM.	2005-04-26

Dr. Michael Brown holds nothing back in this book.  He lays it all out for the reader to see.  It seems nothing sacred is left untouched in this book from our prayerlessness, apathy at winning souls, our attitude toward revival, and our status quo Christianity.  Dr. Brown takes the sword of the Spirit and drives it deep into the heart (Ephesians 6:17; Hebrews 4:12).<br /><br />The book will challenge you if you are satisfied with your Christian life.  I believe we should never come to a place where we are \\"happy in Jesus.\\"  We should always be hungry for more of God's Spirit in us, desperate for the presence of God in our fellowships, and praying earnestly for the lost.  Dr. Brown puts his finger on all that holds back the presence of God.  He is hungry for Jesus to be lifted up in His Church as the true head (Colossians 1:15-18; 1 Timothy 6:15-16).  This book stirs up the cry for true repentance and a hunger for holiness in the Church of Christ.  A great book for all true disciples of Jesus.	2005-04-24

As a young disciple I use to dread when missionaries would come to speak and ask us to give money for world evangelism.  But now I see how biblical and important it really is.<br /><br />Piper opens his book by helping the reader to see that evangelism is not the most important aspect of Christianity but worship is.  Piper shows from Scripture how God views worship and He longs for His children to worship Him (John 4:23-24).  The Psalms are full of references to worshipping God.  Piper writes that once we begin to truly worship God we will see His heart for missions and that missions is actually an expression of true worship.  Missions glorifies God because it brings more worshipers (Matthew 28:19-20).<br /><br />What I appreaciate about John Piper in all his books is his desire to be biblical.  Piper doesn't just give a passage of Scripture and then spend the rest of the chapter telling his own stories but he actually dives into the text.  Reading Piper's book is like reading a devotional.  By the end of this book you will be able to fully understand from Scripture why God says, \\"Let the nations be glad.\\"	2005-04-23

It is not a tool used to help Mormons see their errors although it may.  McKeever is actually writing this book to Christians to help them understand Morminism.  It is his prayer that Christians will engage Mormons and discuss their faiths in order to help Mormons see that salvation doesn't come through our own good works but by God's grace alone.<br /><br />Overall I found this book to be very simple to read and understand.  McKeever defines Mormon beliefs and defends historic Christianity.  The book is written almost like a systematic text with various doctrines given their own chapter.

Leaders are important and very biblical (Acts 20:28; Ephesians 4:11-16).  However, how leadership is to be driven, accompished, and so forth is where I differ with Mr. Easum.<br /><br />The book seems to have embraced much of the \\"emerging church\\" philosophy.  In fact, the Scriptures are almost ignored except when it fits into the model that Easum is presenting.  As with most emerging church leaders such as Easum, Rick Warren, Geroge Barna, C. Peter Wagner and others - the Bible seems almost secondary to polls, charts, and business practices of Wall Street companies.  All this is hid under the banner of \\"All truth is God's truth.\\"<br /><br />Brethren, we are facing a leadership crisis in the Church.  And I would agree with Easum that times are changing but we must stand firm upon Scripture as our final authority for faith and practice (1 Timothy 4:16).  I am not advocating monestaries or no change at all but simply to be biblical.  We must keep in the mind the offense of the cross (1 Corinthians 1:18) and that Jesus said all men would hate us because of Him (John 15:18-25).  The Church is not like the world (Matthew 20:20-28) and leadership should flow from biblical truth and not from business practices of men (James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17).<br /><br />For more biblical approaches to leadership see:<br /><br />John MacArthur, LEADERSHIP BY THE BOOK<br /><br />Frank Viola, WHO IS YOUR COVERING?	2005-04-23

Mormons have a history that they would love to bury in the sands of time but Abanes has preserved it for us.<br /><br />For Christians, this book will help you learn more about the LDS faith and teachings.  While Abanes is not writing a defense of Christianity (1 Peter 3:15-16), he does do a good job of showing the differences between the two faiths.  For those who somehow believe that Mormons are brethren in Christ, read this book and you will see that the divide is still quite wide (Gal. 5:1-4).	2005-04-23

That is why this book is a must read for every disciple.<br /><br />This book exposes abusive churches.  Dr. Enroth even names names.  Every chapter opens with an abusive story.  Each person is real.  Each person has been hurt by abusive churches.  The irony is that the leaders discussed in the book fail to see their abuses.  Many try to cover them up or simply ignore the pain they have dealt to others.<br /><br />In the end, I appreciated Dr. Enroth showing the reader that Jesus is not the abuser.  While most of these religious groups claim to be speaking in His name or even quote Scripture, they have twisted the teachings and practices of Jesus to be something He never intended (1 John 5:1-4).  Truly, Jesus is not like men (Hebrews 13:8) and He will not cause us the pain that is found in this book (Matthew 11:28-30).	2005-04-22

I believe it does.  However, I also know that Satan blinds the minds of unbelievers (2 Corinthians 4:4).  Jesus said blessed are those who believe and yet do not see (John 20:29).  The evidence is there for the seeker (Romans 3:10-11) but we must repent and become disciples and that simply goes against our flesh (Galatians 5:16-17).	2005-04-22

Did Jesus rise from the dead?  Is the gospel trustworthy that is contained in the Bible?<br /><br />Lee Strobel puts his degree to work.  In this enlightening book, Strobel interviews many different types of theologians, scholars, and archeologist to see if there is evidence for Jesus.  He collects his data and then allows his reader to make the final conclusion.  I believe his case is closed.<br /><br />The book is a delight to read because Strobel leads the reader into the chapter by discussing the issue at hand, who he is about to interview, completes the interview, and then asks the interviewer to share how Jesus Christ has impacted their life.<br /><br />For disciples of Jesus who want more information on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ outside of the Bible then this is the book.  Strobel's book will give you ample evidence for the case for Christ.  I would encourage you to give this book to an unbeliever and then study the Bible with them and see them baptized into Jesus (Acts 2:38,41).	2005-04-22

The world is lost without Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12) and we must take the gospel into every nation (Matthew 28:19-20).  How can we accomplish this goal?  How can we reach 700 million Muslims, 1 billion Catholics, 500 million Hindus, 300 million Buddhist, and many more like Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, agnostics, atheists, and other religious groups?  Simple: through the power of prayer.<br /><br />Duewel's book will lead you to see the power of prayer.  You will see how God can use your intercessory prayers to touch the nations.  The Western Church is depending far too much on her money, fame, technology, etc. to carry the gospel but we must see that the power of God comes first when we humble ourselves and pray (Acts 1:14; James 4:10).  May we truly be disciples of Jesus and touch the world through mighty praying (Luke 11:1-13).	2005-04-22

His famous LECTURES TO MY STUDENTS has been read and studied by many preachers down through the years.<br /><br />This smaller book on pastoral ministry is often overlooked.  AN ALL-AROUND MINISTRY (proper title) is a wonderful addition to LECTURES TO MY STUDENTS.  In this work Spurgeon gives practical advice to young preachers concerning the work of the ministry.  His desire is to simply glorify God in all that we say or do (Colossians 3:17).  Spurgeon's heart pours out from every topic from speaking to prayer.

Torrey were alive would he identify himself with the charismatic movement or would he avoid the termonology?  I believe he would probably not be a charismatic and would probably even be an anti-charismatic from some of his views on the early Pentecostals.  However, this book will make you wonder yourself.<br /><br />In this work, Torrey gives his biblical understanding of the second work of grace with the baptism with the Holy Ghost.  Torrey believes that every Christian receives the Spirit at salvation (Romans 8:9) but not every Christian is baptized with the Holy Spirit (Luke 24:49).  He believes the \\"Promise of the Father\\" (Acts 1:4) is for every Christian who will tarry and pray for the Baptism (Luke 11:13).<br /><br />Ironically, Torrey's book is now widely read by Pentecostals because of his second work teaching.  Torrey's understanding came from his revivalist views along with D.L. Moody and other late 19th century revivalist.  It set the stage for the early charismatic movement although Torrey distinced himself from the early Pentecostals as did A.B. Simpson.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend you reading this book even if you differ with Torrey's baptism language (filled vs. baptized) or his second work of grace view.  The book does offer a challenge to us to be used mightily by God (Acts 1:8) and to trust in the power of the Holy Spirit and not the strength or wisdom of men (1 Cor. 2:1-5).	2005-04-18

Like Paul the Apostle in Romans 10:1-4, the Caner's offer their love and prayers for 700 million Muslims to find true salvation through the gospel of Jesus Christ.  The entire book, I found, was written with a heart not only to reveal what Islam teaches but to help Christians make disciples of Muslims.  And thankfully, because of brethren such as the Caner's, this is happening.  The gospel is spreading with fire througout the 10/40 window as millions of Muslims are now hearing the truth of Jesus (Romans 10:14-17).<br /><br />The book is a fast paced book to read.  I got caught up with not only the beliefs of Islam (which are vague to me living in a strong Christian foundation in Georgia) but also to the lives of the Caner's and how they became disciples of Jesus (Matt. 28:19-20).  Truly, Luke 14:25-35 applies to Muslims who count the cost, abandon the false religion of Islam, denouce Mohommad as a false prophet, and make Jesus their Lord and Savior.  You can see that in the Caner's lives.<br /><br />This book is great not only for understanding the false beliefs of Islam, their distortion of who Jesus truly is, and their confusion over Christianity but it also will strengthen your prayer life for the Muslims as you see God's grace in the lives of the Caner's.	2005-04-18

These truly are expository commentaries.  The outlines are simply worth the price for all these works.  Phillips has done are marvelous job of taking the Scriptures and teaching through them verse by verse and at the same time giving us Bible teachers outlines that we can use to teach from as well.<br /><br />In fact, I would say that this commentary on Acts is one of the best devotional books you can find.  Phillips' insights are very down to earth and he doesn't take the reader on a journey that the reader will not understand but leads you verse by verse, scene by scene through Acts.  He will touch on doctrinal issues if necessary but he doesn't take up pages trying to convince you of his position but simply let's the Scripture speak for itself.<br /><br />Finally, I appreciate that Phillips uses a literal translation.  In this case it is the King James Version.  Many commentaries have gone the route of dynamic equivalent translations (such as the NIV).  Because Phillips uses the KJV throughout, he does have to translate the text into modern language.  Therefore I would rather him have used the New King James but I still praise God that Phillips used a literal text (as well as the Greek when needed).	2005-04-18

Many think this book is an attack on Bruce Wilkerson's THE PRAYER OF JABEZ but in reality, Hanegraaff praises Wilkerson for helping people learn to pray in his forward.  While he is critical in some places of some points that Wilkerson made, he does so in love and not in a harsh tone.<br /><br />This book is a short work on prayer.  There are other books that offer more biblical exegesis on prayer passages (see THE SPIRIT HELPS US PRAY) yet this is more of a devotional work on prayer.  Hanegraaff takes the Lord's prayer (Matthew 6:5-13) and devotes chapters to each part of the Lord's prayer.  He uses personal illustrations to teach his reader his points.<br /><br />The only drawback I found to this book is that it is hard for me to seperate Hanegraaff from his normal office, apologetics.  His books on apologetics are much better than this book on prayer.  While I don't know Hanegraaff personally, I don't think of him as a \\"man of prayer.\\"  Not that he doesn't pray I simply mean I see him defending our faith while I see Jim Cymbala on his face before God in prayer.  Thankfully, God wants every Christian to pray and so I enjoyed Hanegraaff's work on prayer and I recommend it.	2005-04-18

Prayer is not a learned technique that we copy from others but it is something the Spirit of God must do in our hearts and lives (Luke 11:1-13; Romans 8:26-27; Eph. 6:18).  Many have tried to read this classic work on prayer and have felt that Torrey doesn't teach us to pray.  It simply is not written for that purpose.<br /><br />This book is not so much an exegesis on passages of Scripture on prayer but is Torrey's insights and personal illustrations of answers to prayer, hinderances to prayer, and the power of prayer.  Torrey, like other classic writers on prayer, assumes that Christians pray (1 Samuel 12:23).  Therefore he doesn't spend much time trying to coerce the reader to pray but fills the reader with faith-filled stories of pray-ers.  He wants us to see that prayer is powerful because of who God is (Hebrews 11:6; James 5:16-17).<br /><br />Read this book but more than that: pray without ceasing (1 Thess. 5:17).	2005-04-18

Bruce was a well respected biblical scholar and his commentaries and books have greatly benefited the Church of Christ.  It is no different than with this work on the Book of Acts.<br /><br />This book falls in line with the rest of the New International Commentary on the New Testament edited by Gordon Fee.  The NIC is a solid evangelical commentary on the New Testament with the differing opinions stated in the works (see Revelation for example).  Dr. Bruce has gone to great lengths to point out the differences among evangelicals in Acts.  The commentary itself is full of Greek word studies, historical and geographical points, maps, and solid exegesis of every passage in Acts.<br /><br />My only drawback with this work on Acts as well as the other works of the NICNT is that they are not laid out in expository outlines.  It would be helpful if every section was given an expository outline to help the reader when moving through the sections of the Scriptures that the authors are working through.

I have been disappointed with the Bibles coming out of the American markets (but quite happy with my Cambridge Bibles) as the American press seems to be going the path of quantity rather than quality.  Nelson, Zondervan, Foundation, Tyndale, and Crossway have not put out any quality Bibles in several years.  So I wanted to see how Hendrickson would do.  I was not happy.<br /><br />For one, the leather is not great quality.  It has the look and feel of a Thomas Nelson Bible.  Not good.  The pages are a step up from Nelson and others but not near the quality of Cambridge Bibles.<br /><br />Secondly, the text is easy to read, in black letter in both the KJV and NIV (which are both pluses for me) but the helps are not helpful.  Unless you are \\"follow it by the book\\" pastor (and I don't mean the Bible itself but the helps in the back) then you will want to do you own preparing for funerals, baptisms, marriages, etc.  The helps are not helpful.<br /><br />Finally, the plan of salvation in the back was not biblical despite being in the back of a minister's Bible.  It promoted the sinner's prayer and decisional regeneration rather than disciple's baptism (Acts 2:38; 8:12-13, 36-38; 9:18; 10:48; 16:14-15, 30-34; 18:8; 19:5; 22:16).

Jim Goll writes this book with an eye on the passion of the saint for their God.  Goll is not writing to create fans or to sale books but to call the Church to be all that God created her to be.  For far too long we have not responded to the cries of books, sermons, and teachings such as this and taken up our cross to follow Jesus (Luke 9:23-25).<br /><br />I enjoyed Goll's book for several reasons.  First, Goll is very open.  He shares his heart.  He is not trying to hide his own faults in the pages of a book but he is open in his own struggles for God.  Secondly, the book is full of Scripture.  While I didn't necessarily agree with Goll totally in all his uses of Scripture, Goll does offer many passages for the reader to \\"chew\\" on.<br /><br />The negative side of this book is not too bad.  Again, while I didn't agree with some aspects of Goll's book, I do feel that his message is one we need to hear.  We need to be zealous for Jesus (Romans 12:11-12).  We need passion for prayer (Acts 2:42; Eph. 6:18; Col. 4:2; 1 Thess. 5:17).  We need a passion for the lost (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 10:45; 16:15-16; Acts 1:8).  And we need a passion to truly worship God (John 4:24; Php. 3:1-2).<br /><br />Overall, this book is worth the purchase and the reading.	2005-04-15

He always returns to the Bible as the sole authority for truth and further he shows that only God is the Author of knowledge and God's ways are beyond our finite understanding.  Dr. Frame always takes a high view (and I concur with him) in his understanding of logic and knowledge.<br /><br />This is an engaging book for those interested in knowledge or students of apologetics.

Ths subject of lukewarmness is not easy to write about (Rev. 3:14-17) but Dr. Brown writes with love for the Church of God and longs to see it rise up in the power of Pentecost (Acts 2).  Dr. Brown is passionate for holiness, prayer, evangelism, and a true love for Jesus Christ that goes beyond mere form of religion.

If you enjoy the writing of A.W. Tozer, Stephen Hill, or Leonard Ravenhill then you will greatly enjoy the man who literally started the fire in their hearts, the late Samuel Chadwick.  Dr. Chadwick was the President of the old Methodist college in Leeds, England.  His writing is not typical Methodist of our day with their liberal views but he writes with the heart and fire of John Wesley.<br /><br />This short book was based on a series of articles that Dr. Chadwick wrote at Leeds College on the person and work of the Holy Spirit.  Identifying himself with the Pentecostal Methodists of the late 19th century, Chadwick's theology is reflected in this book on the Baptism with the Holy Spirit.  Chadwick is not charismatic or modern Pentecostal in his thought but believes the Baptism of the Spirit brings power for service (R.A. Torrey, D.L. Moody) and is evident through prayer and holiness.<br /><br />While you might not agree with Chadwick's second work theology, the passion this man had for Jesus is clear.

While I am not a fan of C. Peter Wagner or his books, I do want to write a review that is based on the book and not my personal feelings toward Wagner.  I do take exception with the reviewer who feels that Wagner will be ranked with the likes of John Wesley or Martin Luther in 100 years but that is beside the point.  Only Jesus should be honored at all (1 Timothy 6:16).<br /><br />The book deals with the charismatic emphasis on the third wave and more specifically the apostle/prophet movement begun by Wagner, John Wimber, Bob Jones, and Bill Hamon.  The book essentially outlines Wagner's desire and his personal eye-witness to the changes he sees coming (and have come) from the third wave movement and these above mentioned teachers.  In many ways, Wagner writes with a positive view toward the future and he believes that God is preparing His church for a mighty world-wide revival.<br /><br />The problems with this book are many.  For one, Wagner, while a theologically trained man, seems to take exception with theology (see chapter 8).  He sees theology as more of a hinderance to a move of God than a plus.  He believes the walls of doctrine need to fall down and bring together Catholics, Evangelicals, Liturgical Protestants, and of course Pentecostals and Charismatics.  The problem with this view is that it ignores the call to hold to sound doctrine (1 Timothy 4:15; Titus 2:1) and ignores defending the historic Christian faith (1 Peter 3:15-16; Jude 3-4).  Theology is vital to the Church (John 8:31-32; 1 Corinthians 15:1-2; Galatians 3:1-5).<br /><br />Secondly, the book has the feel of the whole emerging church idea.  Wagner is willing (and seems delighted) to let go of sound teaching for whatever causes the church to grow.  Whether it be the Open God views of Clark Pinnock or Oneness Pentecostals or Catholics.  The point for Wagner (and sadly many other charismatics) is experience is the key.  Experience in Christ and the Spirit is the ultimate unity binder.  Of course, this is not biblical (1 Cor. 1:10-17; 3:10-17; James 2:14-26; 1 John 2:3-6).<br /><br />Finally, the book follows suit with many other church growth gurus and fails to offer a biblical pattern for church growth.  Wagner highlights text that benefit his chapters but fails to exegete the passages.  In the end the reader is left chasing experience and embracing whatever it takes to get my church to grow with little thought of \\"is this biblical?\\".  Charles Spurgeon rightly noted, \\"The church that is most loved by the world is surely that which is most abhored by God.\\"the ultimate unity binder.

He is accurate to see these as going hand in hand (Matthew 9:38; Luke 10:2; Acts 1:8, 14; 2:38, 41-42; 12:5; 16:13-15; Romans 12:12; Colossians 4:2-6).<br /><br />I would urge the reader to purchase this book and read it for yourself.  I agree that there are errors in Silvoso's theology in that he holds to terroritorial spirits, believes in mass evangelism through altar calls and the sinner's prayer, is theologically lacking in its substance, confuses experience with Christ as a point of unity, and has an unbiblical view of the authority of Satan, nonetheless the book does inspire one to pray with fire and faith in Jesus.	2005-04-09

This is certainly the case with POSSESSING THE GATES OF THE ENEMY.  I love to read books on prayer from the works of great prayer warriors like E.M. Bounds to modern books such as FRESH WIND, FRESH FIRE by Jim Cymbala.  I bought this book hoping for much of the same insights and pointers to help me build my faith in prayer.  This was sadly not the case.<br /><br />The book, like other charismatic prayer books, tends to share many examples of answers to prayers, miracles, etc. instead of wrestling with the Scriptures on prayer (for this see Paul Cedar's THE PRAYER LIFE and David Jeremiah's THE PRAYER ADVERNTURE).  The book doesn't have the impact of conviction over neglect of prayer as say the works of Leonard Ravenhill or A.W. Tozer.  The book spends too much time on the experiences of prayer rather then preparing the pray-er for prayer.<br /><br />The irony is that the best chapter in the book is entitled \\"Flaky Intercessors\\" in which Jacobs deals with the bizarre elements often seen in intercessory prayer.  She obviously is refering to much of the charismatic intercessors for I know of biblical intercessors here in the USA and abroad who pray with fire, passion, and yet remain firmly committed to sound doctrine and practices (1 Timothy 4:16).  The book as a whole, I felt fits best into flaky intercessors hands rather than a disciple of Jesus (Luke 11:1-13).<br /><br />Let me end with a positive however.  I enjoyed Jacobs heart to see the Church praying with a true hunger for God.  This is the cry I believe we need!  While I might not agree with 100% of the book, the book is well worth reading to spark a desire to pray.  For those of you who disagree with me, I simply say let's get on our faces and pray!  Let's pray with faith (Mark 11:22-25) and with the power of the Spirit (Romans 8:26,27; Jude 20).  Mighty things take place when God's people pray!en God's people pray!	2005-04-09

Green does a great job of putting together a simple and easy to read literal translation.<br /><br />The book comes with three columns: one is Green's literal translation, the second is the Greek text with English subtitles and Strong's numbering, and the third text is the King James Version.  Green uses the Textus Recepticus (TR) as his Greek text and thus he uses the King James Version as his side text.  While I would prefer the New King James Version, I enjoy Green's Literal Translation just as much as I do the NKJV.<br /><br />For Bible teachers and students this edition is well worth the money.

While these methods may not be right or wrong, these books fail to take an honest look at leadership from the Bible.  We are not take the Bible plus the world's leadership values and reinforce them upon the Church but we are to be biblical and that is it (Titus 2:1).<br /><br />That is why I enjoyed Dr. John MacArthur's THE BOOK ON LEADERSHIP.  As a teacher of the Word who loves the Word, Dr. MacArthur faithfully seeks to teach what the Scriptures teach about leadership.  His concern is not the latest how-to books or the latest Church Growth gimmicks but his heart is to follow the Bible completely in all areas of church leadership.<br /><br />Each chapter covers a portion of what the Bible teaches about leadership.  Whether you are a leader in the church or you have biblical questions about leadership, I urge you to turn to this book.  While I didn't agree with MacArthur all the time, he does seek to build a biblical case.<br /><br />The only drawback to this book is that it didn't focus on leaders being people of prayer.  I agree with MacArthur 100% that we need strong theology, strong preaching and teaching, and Christ-like leaders but one of the traits of being like Jesus is prayer (Luke 11:1; 18:1).  We need men of God who's knees are worn out and their eyes are red from the tears they have wept over the condition of the modern Church.  We need preachers who will stand in the pulpit and deliver and word from God that they received while on their face in worship before a holy God.  We need men of prayer (1 Timothy 2:1-6, 8).	2005-03-30

Having been raised much like Robert Gundry, in a church and family that strongly believed in the pre-tribulation rapture view, I was not highly interested in reading a book that I knew would challenge my view.  However, I am glad I did.<br /><br />Bob Gundry takes a hard look at the rapture of the Church of Jesus Christ and he comes to the conclusion that the Bible does not teach the popular pre-tribulation rapture view expoused by popular teachers such as Tim LaHaye (LEFT BEHIND), Dr. John MacArthur (THE SECOND COMING), and many other evangelicals.  Gundry looks at nearly every major second coming passage from Matthew 24-25 to 2 Thessalonians 2 to the book of Revelation to put together a view that was largly held by the Church until the late 1800's.<br /><br />I would encourage you to read this book.  While you might not agree with Gundry, he will rattle your theological cage.  He did that to me.  A friend of mine once said that he held to the pan-tribulation view.  It will all pan out in the end.  Who really knows when Jesus will come?  I for one will keep my eyes on Him until He comes (1 Cor. 9:24-27; Hebrews 12:1-3).<br /><br />For more on the post-tribulation view see George Ladd's THE BLESSED HOPE and his commentary on the book of Revelation.	2005-03-30

The book came to me at a time when I was studying the Bible with some Bible college students who held to a radical non-Lordship view of salvation (see Zane Hodges' ABSOLUTELY FREE!).  Dr. MacArthur helped me to firmly grasp what the Bible teaches about the Lordship of Jesus over my entire life.<br /><br />This book, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE APOSTLES, is a follow up to THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS.  In this book, Dr. MacArthur looks at the Lordship issue from the epistles.  Did the Apostles embrace Lordship?  Did the Apostles expect the entire Church to submit to the Lordship of Christ?  This book examines this issue.<br /><br />Dr. MacArthur also examines arguments against the Lordship issue in more detail and includes historical sermons and statements from the pages of Church History concerning the Lordship issue.<br /><br />A great book and a must read for anyone interested in the Lordship issue or you simply want to grow closer to Jesus.	2005-03-25

Books	4	12	13	N	N	Short Work on the Carnal Christian Teaching	Ernest Reisinger examines the modern church's teaching of the carnal Christian.  In a nutshell, many such as Tony Evans, Charles Swindoll, and Charles Stanley teach that one can be saved and on their way to heaven but still living in obedience to Satan, the flesh, and the world.  They take their text from 1 Corinthians 3:1-4 and seek to build a case that Paul's usage of the word \\"carnal\\" (KJV, NKJV) or \\"fleshly\\" (NASB; ESV) means that the Corinthians were living in sexual immorality, ungodliness, and outright sin yet Paul calls them not lost but carnal.<br /><br />Is that biblical?  Does the Scripture teach the preservation of the sinner while being a saint by position?  Dr. Reisinger looks at this issue and seeks to show his position from the Scripture.<br /><br />My only complaint of this book is a minor one and that is that it is simply too short.  So many teach, practice, and believe in the carnal Christian idea and yet this work is one of the few to be found on the issue.  Larger works are devoted to the carnal Christian teaching (see Stanley's ETERNAL SECURITY: CAN YOU BE SURE?; Swindoll's THE GRACE AWAKENING; Evans' THE PROMISE; Hodges' ABSOLUTELY FREE!; Chafer's HE THAT IS SPIRITUAL; and Ryrie's THE BALANCED CHRISTIAN LIFE).<br /><br />For a detailed and biblical look at salvation, eternal security, and the carnal Christian teaching see Dan Corner's THE BELIEVER'S CONDITIONAL SECURITY.	2005-03-25

While I did not agree fully with Dr. Geisler's views on many issues such as eternal security, I do believe he put together a well thought out book on the issue of election.  Dr. Geisler does not advocate class election as often done by Arminians (see Robert Shank's ELECT IN THE SON) but he does offer a philosophical and biblical agrument for free will in the light of God's absolute sovereignty.  Dr. Geisler is not an Open Deist (see Clark Pinnock's THE OPEN VIEW OF GOD) but he does believe that a sovereign God made humanity with a free will.<br /><br />For a thorough discussion on eternal security see Daniel Corner's THE CONDITIONAL SECURITY OF THE BELIEVER.

This is not his argument in this book.  What he argues against is a dead faith that is preached by Charles Stanley and many other eternal security advocates.  The Scriptures clearly teach that we are saved by faith but this is not a one time act but an ongoing act of faith (John 3:36; 5:24-25; 20:31; 1 John 5:13).  Faith is not mere mental assent to the gospel (James 2:19).  True faith does not run into a life of sin (Titus 2:11-15) but it runs in obedience to the commands of Jesus (John 8:31-32; 14:15; 15:1-8; Acts 5:32; Romans 1:5; 2:7-10; 6:1-23; 8:12-13; 11:20-22; 1 Cor. 9:24-10:21; 15:1-2; 2 Cor. 1:24; Gal. 5:1-4; 6:7-9; Php. 2:12-15; Col. 1:21-23; 3:1-4; 2 Thess. 1:8-10; Heb. 2:1-4; 3:6-19; 4:1-16; 5:8-9; 6:4-20; 10:19-39; 11:13-16, 30; 12:1-29; James 1:21-25; 2:14-26; 4:4-10; 5:19-20; 1 John 1:5-2:6; 3:6-9; Rev. 17:14; 21:8).<br /><br />In this short work Corner exposes Charles Stanley's false and misleading message of once saved, always saved (2 Peter 3:17-18).  Corner is well versed and well documented.  He is not citing his opinions but rather he allows Stanley to define what he believes by his own words from Stanley's sermons and books.  You will be shocked to see such heretical and sinful teaching all in the name of grace.<br /><br />Those who enjoy their sin and enjoy living in disobedience to Jesus will love the sermons and books by Charles Stanley but those committed to biblical truth will see his views as misleading and unbiblical.  Thankfully God knows those who are His (2 Timothy 2:19).	2005-03-01

He believed that the Church was playing games with a holy God and that the need of the hour was for genuine revival praying.<br /><br />This book is not a how to of prayer.  It is much more.  It is a call to prayer.  It is a much needed rebuke of our spiritual laziness and apathy (Amos 4:1).  We need men and women of faith to rise up and pray with all their might (1 Samuel 12:23; 1 Thess. 5:17).  The sad reality is that the early Church was birthed in prayer (Acts 1:14) but today's church knows nothing of prayer.

Shank first allows Calvin and other Calvinist theologians to merely state in their own words their position on election and/or predestination.  Shank then spends the remainder of the book building his case for class election or that Christians become the elect (1 Timothy 4:10) in the elected one, the Lord Jesus (Isaiah 53:11-12; Matthew 1:21; Eph. 1:3-14).  Shank covers nearly every major passage on election in the New Testament including Romans 9-11.<br /><br />My only drawback with the book is that it is somewhat dated, Shank uses the King James Version throughout, and I don't fully agree with Shank that every case of election is class election.  Certainly Israel was a chosen nation as is the Church (Deut. 6; 1 Peter 2:4-11) but there are cases where God elected individuals as in the case of the prophets, Paul (Acts 26:18; 1 Timothy 1:12-15), and many other biblical characters.<br /><br />A good read on election is John Wagner's edited book REDEMPTION REDEEMED: A PURITAN DEFENSE OF UNLIMITED ATONEMENT or Norman Geisler's CHOSEN BUT FREE (Second Edition).	2005-02-25

Therefore Ferguson and Shaw have written a timely book on leadership for those in the International Churches of Christ and for any leader for that matter.<br /><br />The book takes a hard look at biblical leadership versus various forms of leadership we find in the church today.  The point of the book is not to bash one group or one man but to simply point us back to Jesus Christ and the early Church as our example (1 Cor. 11:1-2; Eph. 5:1).  Paul told us to hold fast to his traditions (2 Thess. 2:15; 3:6).  The book of Acts records that the early Church was a close knit family (Acts 2:41-47) and not a mega-church without love.<br /><br />This book has sent waves of changes in the International Churches of Christ for the better.

Laing's heart is for true disciples (Luke 14:25-35) and Laing has been part of the reformation taking place within the International Churches of Christ.

While I certainly applaud Wallis' desire to help the poor, he greatly overemphasizes humanity's greatest need: salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ (Romans 3:10-27).  I agree with Wallis that the early Church helped the poor (Acts 4:32-37; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; Gal. 2:10), they also taught the masses the truth of salvation only in Jesus (John 14:6; Acts 4:12; 1 Timothy 2:1-6).  Mankinds greatest need is not to have our belly full but our hearts full of the Word of God (Col. 3:16-17).<br /><br />Furthermore, Wallis (along with the Christian political movement) put too much faith in government and not much faith in God (Hebrews 11:6).  Jesus Himself said that His kingdom was not of this world (John 18:36-37) and Paul said that as disciples we don't wrestle with flesh and blood (Eph. 6:11-12) but with demonic forces.  The true disciples battle is not with communism or Democrats or liberals or conservatives but with Satan (2 Cor. 4:1-6).  As disciples we must submit to governing authorities (Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-17) and pray for those in authority (1 Timothy 2:1-2).  Whether they be a George Bush, a Bill Clinton, a Tony Blair, or a Nero.  Our citizenship is not defined by our politics but our fruit (Matthew 3:8; Acts 26:20; 2 Thess. 1:8-10; 1 John 2:3-6).<br /><br />The only way we will change our nation and our world is through making disciples and it does not begin in the White House but in our house (1 Peter 4:17-18).  May we help the poor but even more let us make true disciples (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15-16; Luke 13:1-5; 24:47; Acts 2:38,41).  In the end there will be Republicans, Democrats, Communists, and various other political factions in hell but only true disciples of Jesus will be in heaven (Daniel 12:3; John 5:24-25; Revelation 21:8) and we will bow to one King, Jesus (1 Timothy 6:15-16; Revelation 17:14; 19:11).<br /><br />For further reading see:<br />MacArthur, John WHY GOVERNMENT CAN'T SAVE YOU<br />Thomas, Cal BLINDED BY MIGHTation 17:14; 19:11).

This book is a simple to use apologetical and evangelistic guide to making biblical disciples.<br /><br />Jacoby helps the reader first understand that all disciples of Jesus have been given a mission and that is world evangelism (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:15).  We must step up in Spirit-filled boldness (Acts 4:31) and making disciples of all nations.<br /><br />He then spends the remainder of the book helping the reader learn what steps we need to take when studying with someone who is not a Christian.  The book gives lessons, answers to objections about Christianity, baptism, and offers insights into false religious doctrines in both the Christian church and other religions as well.  Jacoby also writes with a bit of humor here and there to keep it lively!<br /><br />Overall if you are looking for a book on evangelism then I would purchase this book.

Dr. Douglas Jacoby has an insightful book on the Spirit that I believe will be helpful to all disciples seeking a better understanding of the Third Person of the Trinity.<br /><br />The book opens by examining the Holy Spirit from both the Old Testament and New Testament positions.  Dr. Jacoby is careful to teach sound doctrine about the Spirit while clearly showing that the Spirit is not some abstract substance in the disciples life but is actually a Person involved in our Christian life.  The Spirit is helping us to become more like Jesus.<br /><br />The remainder of the book offers insights into more controversial aspects of the Holy Spirit from the manifestations seen in Acts to the modern charismatic movement.  Dr. Jacoby is very gentle as he deals with various aspects of the charismatic movement even if he differs greatly in his understanding and teaching on the gifts of the Spirit and the baptism of the Spirit.  In fact, even charismatics could learn from Jacoby.<br /><br />Overall Dr. Jacoby once again takes an important teaching such as the Holy Spirit and yet biblically and practically gives us a book that is simple yet consise in its content.  An easy to read book but one not afraid of teaching the truth.	2005-02-05

THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE COMMANDS OF JESUS by Peter Wittstock, I was thankful for a book that for the first time set out to help the disciple of Jesus understand just what Jesus meant when He said \\"If you love Me you will obey My commandments\\" (John 14:15).  What are Jesus' commandments?  Are they the Ten Commandments?  The Mosiac Law?<br /><br />Wittstock's book is convicting and yet one of the most enlightning books on practical Christianity that you can read.  He gives practice advice about what it means to be a true disciple of Jesus in the spirit of Bonhoeffer's THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP.  Whittstock writes with a charismatic slant on some issues but overall his book is a much needed message to the Evangelical Church at large to repent of lukewarm discipleship and what it means to be a true Christian.<br /><br />HEAR HIM! will challenge you to a deeper walk with Jesus, will challenge your committment to follow His commands, and yet by the time you are done reading this 265 page book, you'll have a clearer understanding of what it truly means to say that you are a disciple of Jesus (John 8:31-36).

Willow Creek seems to be defining church these days along with Saddleback Community Church.  Entire denominations have reshaped their methods to adapt to the seeker movement.  Is it any wonder than that a book such as this is needed?<br /><br />Pritchard examines Willow Creek Community Church after attending the church for over a year and having unlimited access to the pastors and staff of the church.  He divides his book into two formats.  He first gives an insider's view of Willow Creek and their history, philosophy, and practices.  He covers Senior Pastor Bill Hybels in-depth.  The second section of the book offers a critical review of the church's practices and theology.  To be fair, Pritchard is not overtly critical of the church but he does find some faults but I'll leave that to you to read on your own.	2005-01-13

Koster's COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE was given to me by a lady who left our church for the radical Messianic Jewish followers such as Koster and Michael Rood.  I read the book with great doubts about the book since most serious Messianic Jewish Gentiles I have met were simply bizarre.  This book did nothing more than confirm this view.<br /><br />Koster appears to have taken most of his information from the cult, the Assemblies of Yahweh.  His insistance upon using the various Hebrew names for God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit go from poor understandings of the Greek language to flat out denials.  His writing style is poor and the structure of the book appears to not have been very well thought out.  Koster appears mad throughout the book at the \\"established Church\\" and he seems mad enough to essentially condemn anyone who calls the holy Scriptures \\"the Bible\\" or calls Yahushua \\"Jesus\\" or has a cross up in their meetings or calls their assemblies \\"church\\" or who worship on Sunday (or some other day other than Saturday and dare not call the days or months by its Greek names!) than they are going to burn forever.  Further, any follower of the Messiah not keeping the entire Law of Moses is lost!  Ironically, few Jews have \\"converted\\" to Messianic Jewish roots despite Koster's belief that this will usher in a great harvest of Jews into the kingdom of Elohim.  Could it be they see the error of the Sacred Name Movement as do many Gentiles such as I?<br /><br />For me, Koster and the rest of the radical Messianic follwers are nothing more than the Pharisees of Acts 15.  They seek to add to the salvation given to us by Jesus Christ (Acts 15:9-11).  They want us to keep the Law of Moses but not one person (including themselves) is capable of doing so (Galatians 3:11).  How sad that these men have dived into a works salvation that focuses on rules rather than on Christ's atoning sacrifice (Colossians 2:11-23).  I for one thank God that I am free from the curse of the Law (Galatians 3:13-14) and that Jesus brings no condemnation (Romans 8:1-4; Galatians 5:1-13).) and that Jesus brings no condemnation (Romans 8:1-4; Galatians 5:1-13).	2005-01-10

The book is not some dry doctrinal essay on the Spirit but is every much as its title says: AN EXPERIMENTAL AND PRACTICAL VIEW.

That was my reaction when I first read this book while in Bible college.  Now removed several years from that setting I can personally see the message from this book coming to pass before my very eyes.<br /><br />The pragmatic age has dawned.  We now have churches for every individual needs.  Sound doctrine has been replaced by pop psychology and business data.  Elders today listen more to the business gurus than to the Holy Spirit in the pages of Scripture.  In fact, to stand firm upon the Word of God is now viewed as a fundamentalist, dogmatic, or even (as one former elder told me when he resigned from our church) \\"hard nosed.\\"  Pastors now resemble CEO's more than they resemble Jesus.  As Leonard Ravenhill so put it, \\"We have many Degree's today with no heat.  The early Church had much heat with no Degree's.\\"<br /><br />Thankfully many of the men in this book are standing against the tide of secular, man-centered teachings that are hitting the Church.  Nearly everyone of these men have written books, articles, or preached sermons against the tide of the world invading the Church and the Church not becoming like Jesus Christ meant for us to be.

The genuine calfskin leather is smooth to the touch and smells great.  The paper is perfect Bible paper much like old Nelson Bibles were printed on.  This edition is very easy to read in that it is on one page like a book.  You don't get lost trying to look at cross references (as good as they may be).  The words of Christ are in black letters which appeals to me more than a red letter Bible since all of the Bible is the word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17).<br /><br />The only drawback with this edition is that it is the NIV.  I contacted Cambridge to find out if they will be putting out any New King James, New American Standard, or English Standard editions.  They replied that they are in talks with the groups who hold the copy rights on these versions.  I do pray that they release an edition like this one in a literal translation.  The NIV, while the best of the dynamic equvalent translations, is still not up to par with the KJV, NKJV, NASB, or the ESV.

The average Christian bookstore in America is full of books on evangelism but few critique the message or methods used by many churches today.  In fact, Christians flock to buy purpose driven books but ignore biblical and historical theology in the process.  We need to check all things by God's Word (1 Timothy 4:16; 2 Timothy 3:16-4:6).

Pastor Ira befriends a new pastor in town from First Baptist Church (Ira's former church that he left in A JOURNEY IN PURITY) who leads First Baptist into the modern charismatic movement.  \\"Revival\\" hits First Baptist and for a while it appears that some of the strange doctrines of the new Baptist preacher will do in Ira but Ira does his homework and soon begins to combat the theology of Pastor Durwood.<br /><br />Overall this is a solid book for those looking for a brief introduction into the charismatic movement both historically, theologically, and practically speaking.  My only complaint would be that some of the charismatic teachings in the book are simply not largely found in most charismatic churches.  For example, Pastor Durwood teaches his listeners that Jesus had a sinful nature and that Jesus overcame His sinful nature only by the power of the Holy Spirit.  And we can too!  However, this is not found in any charismatic churches I know of or with any modern charismatic pastors.

Bosworth is best remembered for his stand against the Assemblies of God and the teaching of the initial, physical evidence (which Bosworth felt was not biblical) and for this classic book on healing.  Despite Bosworth's departure from the Assemblies of God in those early days into the Christian & Missionary Alliance, Bosworth remained firmly committed to the doctrine of divine healing in the atonement of Christ.  His views, along with A.B. Simpson's, kept the CMA full of fire.<br /><br />The book deals with, as the title implies, the healing work of Christ.  Bosworth focuses on the promises of God in the Bible for divine healing, the healing ministry of both Jesus and His apostles, and the need for continued healing ministry today.  While I found the work dated somewhat, the book overall captures the passion the early Pentecostals had for the presence of God in their daily lives.<br /><br />Overall, a good book to read for both Pentecostals and non-Pentecsotals.  Bosworth's work is a classic and he is still read and taught in many Pentecostal churches and Bible colleges.  While I didn't agree fully with his views, I do believe Bosworth touches a nerve we need touched and that is simply: we need God's power to be manifested in the Church again.	2004-11-20

The stories in Lawson's book are awesome.  You will be encouraged as you read about the faith and hunger men and women had for the presence of God in their lives.  None of the people in the book were satisfied with simply living for Jesus but they wanted to make a divine impact for the kingdom upon the earth.  From John the Baptist to John Wesley to many unknowns as well you will read the stories of various Christian experiences in God's presence that transformed their lives.<br /><br />My one drawback as I look back at this book is the theology of the book.  Simply put (as one reviewer put it before me): there is none.  Lawson simply tells the stories of the various believers experiences.  The book leaves the impression that the Christian life is simply one experience after another or that a Christian needs one \\"mighty\\" Holy Ghost experience and that is it.  The daily discipleship is lost (Luke 9:23-26).  Further, not all experiences should be outright declared from God.  We must test our experiences by the Scriptures (1 Thess. 5:21; 1 John 4:1).  Doctrine is important (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1) and we must not allow experiences to become the true test of Christianity (2 Cor. 13:5).<br /><br />Get this book.  Read it and most of all, open your Bible and test everything you read by the truth of God's Word (John 17:17).	2004-11-20

Many feel the book is from God and offers salvation to those who read it and take Baxter's vision to heart.  Others simply attack the visions of Baxter or those who have written reviews on the book.  I just want to deal with the content of the book itself.<br /><br />The book gets a two star from me simply because from the beginning of the book until the end you are focused on Baxter's vision.  Her vision is simply incrediable!  As you read the book you can't help but picture hell as she describes it in the book.  Over and over again she reassures the reader that hell is not made for us humans but for the demons and Satan and that if we repent we will not have to suffer in hell.  Thank God for that!<br /><br />The negative aspects of the book are just too many to tell.  First is the theology of the book.  Frankly put, what theology?  Baxter is obviously a charismatic but she never sets forth a sound theology from Scripture on hell or even on salvation (for which Jesus wanted her to write the book).<br /><br />Secondly, is why does Jesus want to give us this revelation through Baxter?  If the Bible is complete (2 Timothy 3:16-17; Rev. 22:18-19) why do we need a new revelation of hell?  Did Jesus not tell us enough in the Bible?  Should we add Baxter's book as the 67th book of our Canon?<br /><br />Third, where is the biblical justification for such a book?  Baxter never attempts to reconcile her visions with Scripture.  Even charismatic teachers such as Bill Hamon and Jack Hayford believe that all visions, dreams, prophetic words should be weighed against the authority of the Bible.  This simply does not happen in this book and Baxter ends her book without ever writing a chapter to examine her vision by the clear teachings on hell from the pages of holy writ.<br /><br />In conclusion, this simply is a poor book.  Those who live their lives based on subjective experiences may find this book intriguing but those committed firmly to the authority of Scripture will not find any value in reading Baxter's book.  Stick with the biblical revelation of hell and not the twisted visions from this book.iences may find this book intriguing but those committed firmly to the authority of Scripture will not find any value in reading Baxter's book.

He was truly a Spirit-taught man of God who learned how to wait in God's presence and allowed the Lord to open His Word to him.  Out of his relationship with Jesus came many powerful books.  All of Tozer's works are gems.<br /><br />In this classic book, Tozer takes aim at the comfort level of most churches.  He says that we are on a course of either rutting as the children of Israel did in the wilderness, rotting as many of the bodies of the Israelites did (1 Cor. 10:1-13) or revival.  It is our choice.  While Tozer may seem to be moving toward an Arminian understanding of revival, he clearly believes that we must wait for God's presence to come to truly declare a revival.<br /><br />Good reading from Tozer.	2004-11-19

The book is indeed the actual sermons that Charles Spurgeon preached on the grace of God for our eternal salvation.<br /><br />Spurgeon was a genius.  There is simply no one to match him as a preacher in the English world.  While his voice can never be heard, Spurgeon's sermons live on and this is a classic on grace.  Too often we fail to understand the grace of God.  Many claim God's grace for their sins but never truly repent from their sins (Jude 4).  Many more claim grace but never pursue holiness (Titus 2:11-12).  God's grace enables us to live for Christ from the start to the finish.  In fact, apart from the grace of God no one could be saved (Romans 3:23-24; Eph. 2:8-9).  Spurgeon clearly shows this from Acts 16:30-31.<br /><br />For those longing to know more about the grace of God, this book will build up your knowledge and faith (2 Peter 3:18).  While short, it carries a powerful and timeless message.	2004-11-13

Furthermore, De Arteaga fails to point out the unbiblical aspects of the charismatic movement that he and I both know are there from false prophecies to excess of the flesh.<br /><br />My biggest problem with De Arteaga is that while he seeks to urge believers not to be so judgemental, he fails to give us reasons not to question doctrine.  Paul commands us to teach that which accords to sound doctrine (Titus 2:1).  Purity of doctrine and life go hand in hand (1 Timothy 4:16).  Jesus told us to beward of false shepherds (Matthew 24:23-25).  John said many false teachers have gone forth to deceive (1 John 2:18).  We must question all things by Scripture alone (1 John 4:1) and not by our own subjective, personal experiences.<br /><br />Further, De Arteaga tries to link anti-charismatic views to Calvinism.  While many Calvinist have indeed spoken out against charimatic theology (MacArthur, James White, B.B. Warfield, Charles Ryrie, Charles Stanley) many Calvinist do embrace non-cessastionism (Sovereign Grace Ministries, C.J. Mahaney, J. Rodman Williams).  To try to link Calvinism as the cause of cessasionist views is simply misleading.	2004-11-11

It is quite easy to get into a mindset that says I'll do whatever it takes to get youth through the door and so you run out to read the latest how-to books from successful youth ministries such as Doug Fields and Saddleback Community Church.  Sadly, most youth pastors never try to biblically evaulate what they read.<br /><br />This is the case with Doug Field's book.  Taking his concepts from his pragmatic senior pastor, Rick Warren, Fields writes a book aimed at youth pastors (hey if Warren can make money off adults, Fields can make money off youth).  The book follows the same concept of THE PURPOSE DRIVEN CHURCH literally point to point.  Both Warren and Fields advocate ministry that revolves around the five priniciples of ministry.<br /><br />The problems with this book are the same as Warren's THE PURPOSE DRIVEN CHURCH and THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE.  Both Fields and Warren have a faulty view of man's depravity, man's utter inability toward righteousness, and a low view of God's sovereignty through preaching.  The books offers \\"new methods\\" but in reality it makes a mockery of the gospel by making growth the goal and not true disciples.  It focuses on seekers and the unchurched while ignoring the saints.  Truly, the Down-Grade controversy in our day is found from the pens of Bill Hybels, George Barna, C. Peter Wagner, Rick Warren, and now Doug Fields.<br /><br />I urge all youth pastors to close this book and get on your face before a holy God with your Bible open.  You don't need to worry yourself with how to reach youth but how to touch God.  You need to feed the sheep and not amuse the goats.  Make disciples one at a time and preach the gospel faithfully leaving the results in the hands of the omnipotent king (Eph. 1:3-14).	2004-11-09

This book is an early (1997) view of the Brownsville revival that begin on Father's Day in 1995.  Crisco's life and ministry were transformed and largely the revival begin with the youth ministry more so than the adults.<br /><br />Crisco will challenge you.  He will challenge you to pursue God with all your heart and he writes with compassion for dead churches.  His main heart in this book is for youth and youth pastors.  He challenges youth and youth pastors to seek the fire of God.<br /><br />While I didn't agree with every aspect of Brownsville, their revival, or even with some of the points Crisco makes in this book, I did enjoy the book and found it easy to read.  Crisco has a heart for Jesus and this shines through in this book.	2004-11-09

They all are the new professional leaders of the \\"emerging church.\\"  Dan Kimball is more like an adult youth pastor than a defined prayer warrior.  His book is full of the methods he has used over the years to produce numeric results (which fits into Warren's pragmatic theology quite well).  This book is the down-grade of Christianity within the American culture.  In the desire to reach a new generation, new writers like Kimball have sent the Church on a downward spiral that is quickly abandoning sound theology (Titus 2:1) and true worship (John 4:23-24; 1 Cor. 11:17-34) for feel good messages, seeker services, and everything else but expository preaching (1 Cor. 1:18-25).<br /><br />For more information on the down-grade of Christianity see Iain Murray's book THE FORGOTTEN SPURGEON.	2004-11-06

Hyper-Calvinism: The Battle for Gospel Preaching	Books	5	30	32	N	Y	Spurgeon's Fight For Gospel Preaching	While other readers have had negative opinions of Murray's work on the doctrinal battles between Charles Spurgeon and hyper-Calvinist, I enjoyed Murray's work and thought he did a masterful job of presenting an historical account of the debate.  While sadly this debate no longer rages today (some would say that is good but in light of the seeker movement and the hyper-Rick Warren gospel I believe we need to return to Spurgeon), the book does give us insight into the life and struggles of Charles Spurgeon.  As John Piper coined it, \\"Spurgeon knew how to preach through afflictions.\\"<br /><br />In this book, Murray gives us the historical account of the legendary prince of preachers, Charles Haddon Spurgeon against extreme Calvinist who saw no need to preach the gospel to all men since only the elect would be saved and that by God's sovereign choice.  While Spurgeon agreed that God predestined men to salvation he also believed that the gospel was to be preached to all men, allowing the Holy Spirit to draw men to Christ, and that it was through the medium of preaching that men are saved (1 Cor. 1:18-25).  Spurgeon himself was saved through the preaching of the Word through a Primitive Methodist laymen's preaching at the age of 15.<br /><br />In our day we see the need for true, expository, biblical preaching to return.  We need men hungry for Jesus as Spurgeon, Wesley, Fox, Bounds, Ravenhill, Tozer.  We don't need new methods or new programs but we need the gospel to be preached with authority and power.	2004-11-05

Using an Old Testament eisgesis, Michael Evans has put together a book that promotes pro-America, pro-Israel, pro-Democracy as its base.  Evans tries to tie prophecies given to ancient Israel to modern Israel and goes further to try to show that the blessings we have in the United States are a direct result of us blessing Israel from 1948.<br /><br />The question I ask is, \\"Does God favor nations in the New Covenant?\\"  I would say that He doesn't.  He favors those in His Son (John 3:19-21, 36).  Those who are not Christians, not true disciples of Jesus (John 8:31-32) are not saved and are under His condemnation (John 5:24-25).  Unless people repent of their sins they will die (Luke 13:1-5; Romans 2:4).  Further, a biblical comparison of ancient Israel to modern Israel shows no similarities except in name only.  For example, ancient Israel was a theocracy whereas modern Israel is a democracy.  Ancient Israel was established by God leading the children of Israel out of bondage in Egypt through His servant Moses.  Modern Israel was established (certainly by God's will) in 1948 by the United Nations.<br /><br />For disciples of Jesus we can rejoice that our citizenship is in heaven (Philipppians 3:20; 1 Peter 2:9).  We are not American Christians or British Christians or Iraqi Christians but we are Christians who happen to live in the nations that God so chose to place us in.  Our duty is to Him alone (1 Timothy 6:15-17).	2004-11-05

His web site is full of good material (see [...]) and his radio broadcast is enlightning and fun to listen to.  His books are no exception.<br /><br />In this work, Dr. White writes on the doctrine of Scripture and shows how important it is for the Church of Jesus Christ to hold to Scripture alone as our standard for doctrine, faith, and practice (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1).  Dr. White is a master debater and so within the book he offers mock debates at the end of each chapter.  Further, Dr. White has been recently debating many Roman Catholics and therefore he strongly writes that many of the errors of the cults and the Catholics comes from a faulty view of Scripture.<br /><br />The Reformers stood firm on the foundation of Scripture and we must not give in to the spirit of this age and deny the sole authority of the Word of God.  While many churches today are seeking to become \\"seeker sensitive\\" and more \\"contagious\\" for the world to desire to come, we must not bow to this and we must fully proclaim the inerrant, infalliable Word of God (Romans 1:16; 1 Corinthians 1:18-25).

The classical position being that the every Christian needs to experience the Baptism with the Holy Ghost with the initial, physical sign of speaking in other tongues according to Acts 2:4.  Those who have never spoken in tongues are said to not be Spirit-Filled according to Scripture.  Hughes writes to defend this position.<br /><br />However, this book is much more than the Church of God, Spirit-Baptism, and speaking in other tongues but Rev. Hughes presents a short overview of the entire person and work of the Holy Ghost from the Old and New Testaments.

We have many sermons on prayer but no true pray-ers.  We have many books on prayer (just do a search here on Amazon) but we don't know how to pray.  Nonetheless, Jesus' disciples asked Jesus how to pray (Luke 11:1) because they saw the power of prayer at work in Jesus' life (Luke 5:16; 6:12; 18:1-8).<br /><br />This book is a good introduction to the life and work of the intercessor.  While I believe that all disciples should be intercessors according to 1 Timothy 2:1-2, Sheets gives a strong view that God is raising up intercessors in these end times.  While the book is good reading and easy to grasp, the book does lack biblical exegesis on prayer.  We should be motivated to pray more from the Scriptures than from the examples or experiences of other Christians.  We should pray out of obedience (John 14:12-15) and not just from a desire to have experiences.<br /><br />If you long to pray, to touch the throne of God (Hebrews 4:14-16), to pray for the lost (Romans 10:1), to seek God's will (1 John 5:14-15), to pray without ceasing (1 Thess. 5:17), to pray in the Spirit (Romans 8:26-27; Eph. 6:18; Jude 20), to devote yourself to prayer (Romans 12:12; Colossians 4:2) then this book is a good edition to your biblical library.	2004-10-26

In fact, I would rate it just a bit ahead of Leonard Ravenhill's best known book, WHY REVIVAL TARRIES?.  The book focuses not on revival as much as prayer.  It is Ravenhill's firm belief that we lack a true sense and awe of God's holiness and majesty because we don't pray (Luke 18:1).  Despite the church being very active in politics, programs, and everything else under the sun, the average church's prayer meeting is either non-existent or lacking.  For example a local church near me boasts in their 500 members but only 6 usually come to their prayer meeting.

Bounds is one of the best writers on prayer.  It's not just that his books are powerful from their exegesis of Scripture on prayer nor that they rock your theology with incrediable insights into how God's answers prayer but they are mighty simply because Bounds lived what he taught.  Most of his books were written after his death because Bounds was not a writer but a pray-er.<br /><br />This book is the best single work by E.M. Bounds because it combines all his works on prayer into one volume.  While the volume is quite long and I don't know of any disciple who can read this in one setting or even in a month because of the heavy conviction they bring.  Bounds is no 21st century, easy gospel, seeker sensitive type preacher but his passion is for Jesus through the power of seeking God's face!<br /><br />I also highly recommend the works of A.W. Tozer, Leonard Ravenhill, and Samuel Chadwick on prayer.	2004-10-17

We have worshiping churches, praying churches, preaching churches, charismatic and non-charismatic churches, emotional churches, liturgical churches, discipling churches but how many can say they belong to a crucified church?  The need for the cross, that symbol of death to sin and faith in Christ, needs to be made once again the sign of true Christians.  Once we begin to live out the gospel in our daily lives then we will see the glory of God once again manifested in the Church.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and grasp.  C.J. Mahaney is not writing a purely theological study of the cross but rather a devotional look at the finished work of Christ that so often we miss in our pursuit for everything else when in reality nothing will satisfy like knowing God is satisfied with Jesus' finished work of atonement.  Praise be to God for His wonderful Son!	2004-10-15

Contrary to popular teaching, house churches by in large do not reject authority but simply believe fully in the priesthood of the saints (1 Peter 2:4-10; Rev. 1:5-6) and that all disciples should use their gifts to edify the entire church (1 Cor. 14:26) rather than a one man show (pastor led churches).  Further, Atkerson and his fellow house church leaders offer biblical, historical, and practical advice for Christians.<br /><br />If you are one who has been troubled by \\"church\\" life (there is none or very little) and you also want to see how house churches fit in the ultimate plan of God than I would urge you to read and study Ekklesia.

Steve Gallagher is to be highly commended for his willingness to write this book.  For far too long men have been patted on the back and told that Jesus loves them all the while they are living in sin and clear disobedience against God (Hebrews 10:26).  Mr. Gallagher paints no pictures of easy, cheap grace answers for sexual addiction.  He paints an ugly, sinful picture of someone bound for hell unless they repent (Luke 13:5; 1 John 2:3-6).<br /><br />In this book you will read chapter after chapter of heart griping tales of sexual addicts in the Church.  Many of them looked like upright men but all the while they were living in sexaul addiction (or as Gallagher puts it, \\"at the altar of sexual idolatry\\" since sexual addicts worship sex).  Gallagher shares how God's Word can set men free if they are willing to lay down their pride, admit their sin to themselves, God, and their families and become accountable for discipleship, prayer, and holiness.<br /><br />Truly \\"without holiness no one will see the Lord\\" (Hebrews 12:14).  We are to make sure that we avoid sexual sins at all cost (1 Corithians 6:19; Hebrews 12:16) for truly, the sexual immoral will not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-11; Galatians 6:7-9; Revelation 21:8).	2004-10-04

His book THE BAIT OF SATAN is a must read for every Christian who suffers from hard leaders, bitter memories, or bitter members.  However, I was disappointed with UNDER COVER.<br /><br />Bevere promotes an unbiblical view of authority that will only feed the present day error of the clergy/laity system.  The church I attend recently suffered from this perspective when half the membership wanted a \\"do it all\\" pastor while the others wanted a servant among the people to teach and equip (Eph. 4:11-16) but not be a CEO type leader.  The CEO members left.<br /><br />In UNDER COVER Bevere tries to promote the idea that God has placed spiritual leaders in authority to help the saints and therefore the saints must submit to their leaders (Hebrews 13:17).  However, the Greek word for \\"submit\\" is a word that means \\"to be persuaded by.\\"  Biblical leaders don't lord it over those in the Church (1 Peter 5:1-4) but they lead by example (John 13:1-13; 1 Cor. 11:1; Hebrews 13:7,17).  Further, all members are equal (Gal. 3:26-29) and all have equal access into the King's prescence (Hebrews 4:14-16; 1 John 2:1-2).  We no longer need a priest for Jesus is our High Priest (Hebrews 7:25).  We are all priests (1 Peter 2:5-9; Revelation 1:6).  God raises up leaders (Acts 20:28) but these leaders are Spirit-led servants and not harsh task masters (Matthew 20:20-28).<br /><br />A good read is Frank Viola's book WHO IS YOUR COVERING? or Gordon Ferguson's GOLDEN RULE LEADERSHIP.	2004-09-28

Many books seem to get caught up in debating with various Calvinistic or Arminian authors on the subject of the five points of Calvinism or the free will of man.  However, this is not the case with Picirilli.  He writes with a goal, a focus, and a point.<br /><br />The book begins with an historical overview of the Calvinism/Arminism debate.  He dives into the life of Jacob Arminius and shows that, contrary to various Calvinist historians, he was completely Reformed in his understanding of man (total depravity), God's sovereignty, and election.  However, Arminius differed with his Calvinist brothers over the extent of the atonement (limited atonement), evangelism, and free will.  He was not Pelagian in his thought but was Reformed and work from that understanding.  Picirilli reveals that much of Arminius has been lost due to many of his followers reshaping his thoughts to become more humanistic despite Arminius refusal to do so.<br /><br />The book goes on to discuss salvation from both the Calvinist and Arminian viewpoints and then Picirilli gives his own Reformed Arminian view.<br /><br />The book is well written, easy to grasp, and will engage both Calvinist and Arminian readers.  I highly recommend it.	2004-09-13

Of course the Bible makes it clear that total and complete surrender is the only way to eternal life (Luke 14:25-35).  But how does one truly surrender to Jesus?

Most fall into the Calvinistic camp of eternal security for all the wrong reasons such as sinful living, laziness, and out right disbelief.  Many Arminians equally fall into their position by wrong motives such as legalism or dogmatism.  However, the topic of eternal security always generates a tough debate.<br /><br />This book expresses that argument.  The book is best described as one long argument without any clear conclusions.  Exegesis of the texts are ignored and instead the book is full of proof-texting (especially by Norman Geisler).  I thought that Michael Horton and Stephen Ashby did the best jobs of presenting their views.  I was highly impressed with the \\"Reformed Arminian\\" view of Ashby.  His arguments are worth getting this book.<br /><br />Overall, while I did not feel that the writers dealt enough with Scripture, the book is fun reading.

For years I tried to reject what he teaches in this book but the more I have read my Bible and the more I have read books by house church leaders the more I have become convinced of its truth.<br /><br />Nee writes about the normal Christian church life.

He tears down the walls of division among believers by pointing to the unity of the Body in Scripture (Eph. 4:4-6) and he forces us to wrestle with nearly every facet of the Church.<br /><br />While I don't agree fully with Nee in all parts, he does force you to go the Bible for your doctrines and practices (1 Cor. 11:2; 2 Thess. 2:15; 3:6).

He truly seeks to establish a God-centered approach to evangelism that is refreshing and encouraging to read.<br /><br />Metzger's book is not a \\"how to\\" manuel for evangelism although he does give you a great overview of the true gospel message and helps the believer to understand that witnessing is made less difficult when we realise that our purpose is to simply tell the whole gospel to the whole person.  Metzger challenges modern evangelism by asserting that the message of the gospel is not just the person of Christ but the doctrines of grace.<br /><br />Overall if you are looking for a book on evangelism than purchase this book today.

Sadly, the book lacks any serious theological treatment of salvation and completely ignores the sovereignty of God in salvation.<br /><br />The book seeks to be a guide both to evangelists and pastors to how to deliever an \\"effective\\" invitation (emphasis on numbers being the key word for effective.)  Dr. Street should have rightly named this book, \\"The Effective Manipulation Methods\\" and then traced the poor theology of Charles Finney right down to Billy Graham.  While Dr. Street does try to answer his critics (such as Martin Llyod-Jones) he never truly gives any answers but simply lists Llyod-Jones' nine reasons not to give an altar call and never gives any biblical reason we should do so.<br /><br />Dr. Street works from a Baptist theology that ignores election and the work of the Holy Spirit (John 6:44; Acts 14:48) and places the emphasis on man (both pastors and hearers).  He cites not one biblical example of an actual altar call or genuine invitation but uses various Scriptures out of context to try to make his point.  He also gives justification to the sinner's prayer method although he never deals with any Scriptures concerning this matter (since there are none I would expect him to do so).<br /><br />Overall, unless you are an Arminian in your evangelistic approach, then I would not encourage you to purchase this book.  It offers nothing in the means of theological content.  You would be better to read Iain Murray's book THE INVITATION SYSTEM or John MacArthur's ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS, or HARD TO BELIEVE.	2004-08-16

In this short 158 page work, Nixon gives his own advice on how to lead comeback churches (or declining churches).  The book offers insights into how to lead your church off a plateau, developing a strategy for growth, overcoming financial challenges, and focusing on spiritual growth.<br /><br />The negative drawback to this book is Nixon's belief (as with most church growth books) that growth can be manipulated and developed by natural talents and strengths.  While I agree that it is the duty of the Church to present the gospel (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15-16) I cannot agree with Nixon's belief that growth is a human agency and not divine (Acts 2:47; Colossians 2:19).  Salvation is a sovereign work of God (Jonah 2:9; Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 1:1-2) while preaching of the gospel is the work of men (Matt. 9:37-38; 28:19; Romans 1:16; 10:14-17; 1 Cor. 3:5-9).<br /><br />However I do recommend this book from much of the practical imputes that Nixon gives to smaller churches while still disagreeing with some Nixon's goals.	2004-08-13

We like to boast on our church membership, morning attendance, Sunday School attendance, giving, etc. But we hardly ever boast about lives being truly set free from sin and free to worship and enjoy God (John 8:31-38). Preachers know how to preach clear, consise, expository sermons but never share their faith outside of their four walls. &quot;Spirit-Filled&quot; members boast in spiritual gifts but never truly share their faith.<br /><br /> This must change! Thankfully God is using Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron to boldly declare that the Church must repent and return to God's heart, evangelism (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8). God did not give us His Spirit so we could get goose bumbs when the right song is played or we hear a sermon we like but He gave us His Spirit to evangelize a lost world. The Church is called to be salt and light (Matt. 5:13-16) and we must allow the light of God's truth to shine through us (Philippians 2:12-16).<br /><br /> This book is easy to read and follow. The 101 lessons build off one another to help the reader grasp the biblical teaching on evangelism. Comfort and Cameron lead you through the entire Ten Commandments to help you understand how important to use the Law to convict sinners (Romans 7:7; 1 Timothy 1:8-11) and lead them to grace (Galatians 3:21-25).<br /><br /> A good book for those true disciples hungry to share their faith as the apostles did (John 15:8).	2004-08-07

This book offers insights into these well intentioned dragons.<br /><br /> The book explores various accounts of pastors and church leaders in their almost daily struggles with dragons. These dragons have ruined pastors lives without knowing it and many have ruined entire ministries. Some of the stories end with a truce but many end with pastors leaving the church and the dragons continuing to tear down lives.<br /><br /> Over all, this book is great. It offers practical advice on how to deal with dragons and when is it time to go. The book is not a cure for dragons (I know because I gave this book to a dragon and he simply said, &quot;Yes, we need to watch out for these types of people in the church&quot;) but it does give a leader comfort to know that their battle is not alone and that many other leaders are in the same struggle with well intentioned dragons.	2004-08-05

The quality, craftsmenship, and the fonts and paper used is simply unbeatable.  In the age of mass production Bibles (especially in the United States), it's good to see the Bibles put out by Cambridge Press.<br /><br />This edition of the King James Version (KJV) is wonderful.  I keep mine next to my bed and I read it every night.  The texture is great (I have the goatskin edition).  The paper is thin but quite easy to turn.  And the font is just right.  Overall this is a great Bible.<br /><br />If you are an NIV or NKJV user, I would urge you to purchase a Bible such as this one in the KJV and simply compare the translations.  I prefer a literal translation such as the NASB, NKJV, or ESV right along with my KJV.  It's good to read from these literal translations and get a good grasp on the Word of God.	2004-07-26

Ferguson is one of the best theologians in the Western hemisphere and his writings are brillant and full of Scripture.<br /><br />In this work, Dr. Ferguson delves into the person and work of the Holy Spirit.  Yet in this short work (288 pages), he covers nearly every work of the Spirit from His divinity to the gifts of the Spirit.<br /><br />The book comes from a Reformed position so those from say a charismatic perspective may not like Ferguson's views on the baptism in the Spirit or the manifestation gifts of tongues and prophecy.<br /><br />Overall, a great book.	2004-07-20

His books, sermons, and leadership are full of God's Word.  His call to the Church of Jesus Christ is simply to faithfully obey the inerrant Word of God.<br />In this work, Dr. MacArthur calls for the Church to learn to discern truth from error by the teachings of Scripture.  He calls for Christians to base their doctrine and practices from the Bible and not from personal experience (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1).  His fear is justified by numerous examples of cultic to simply strange teachings and subjective experiences from the Catholic Church to the charismatic movement.  He in turn gives a biblical examination of these movements and leaves the reader with a deep hunger to remain committed to Scripture.<br />A great book with a powerful message for the modern evangelical church.	2004-07-20

He has done this with his books THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS, FAITH WORKS, RECKLESS FAITH, CHARISMATIC CHAOS, and this work as well.  In each of his books Dr. MacArthur provides his reader not only a fair survey of the topic/movements but also gives his readers biblical exposition on the subject.<br />In this work, Dr. MacArthur reviews the seeker sensitive movement (he has done this again in his book HARD TO BELIEVE).  He uses the infamous Down-Grace controversey during the late 1800's in England and the stand taken by Charles Spurgeon against the down-graders.  Just as Spurgeon saw the down-grade as moving away from the true gospel of grace, MacArthur see's the modern seeker sensitive churches moving away from a true biblical gospel toward a user-friendly, worldly, flesh based gospel that is pragmatic at best.<br />If you are a person who struggles with church growth or possibly a pastor who wants to see their church grow but you frown on much of the church growth movement then I would encourage you to read this book.  Allow God to show you His sovereignty in building His Church through His servant Dr. John MacArthur.	2004-07-12

This edition of the Updated 1995 New American Standard Bible is perfect for studying, reading, or teaching.  The pages are crisp, the verses are in paragraph form (which I feel is better for contextual teaching) and it has over 95,000 center column cross references.  No other Bible even comes close to this many cross references.<br />I recommend you purchase the genuine leather edition.  The leather is durable and looks great.  The Bible is smyth-sewn and comes with a ribbon marker.<br />Overall, this Bible is great.  The NASB is the most literal Bible you can purchase and while it takes time to get use to reading from it (as opposed to say dynamic-equivalent translations such as the NIV or NLT), you will enjoy the comfort of knowing that you are holding a good looking, literal Bible in your hands.	2004-07-09

Obviously Goodwin was in the minority in the Puritan tradition as most Puritans were raised, taught, and believe in what they defined as &quot;pure Christianity&quot; or Calvinism.  Goodwin, much like Jacob Arminius and John Wesley, broke with tradition and actually opposed the majority of theologians, books, and Puritan pulpits in his day.<br />This book examines the bibilical case for unlimited atonement.  Goodwin believed that the atonement of Jesus Christ was for all of humainity and not simply for the elect.  In this masterful work, Goodwin sets out to prove his position and does so in the spirit of Puritanism.  He is clear, consise, and fills the pages of this book with Scripture.  He appeals to God's Word as the final authority for faith and practice and in the end he presents a strong case for unlimited atonement.  His work should line up well with Puritan John Owens classic work, THE DEATH OF DEATH IN THE DEATH OF CHRIST (published by Banner of Trust).	2004-07-09

This calfskin edition is lacking in so many areas.  Let me give you the pros and cons of this edition.<br />PROS - First, The English Standard Version (ESV) is a great translation.  It is an essentially literal translation and reads much better in its flow than the NASB while maintaining a literal translation unlike the NIV. Second, this is a calfskin leather Bible that feels great, smells like leather, and is small enough to easily take into the pulpit or in your briefcase.<br />CONS - First is that the words bleed through nearly the entire Bible especially in the gospels where the words of Christ are in red.  Second, the paper used for the pages is not top quality Bible paper as in the Cambridge editions.  Third, no cross references.<br />I would urge you to wait before buying this Bible until Crossway is able to correct these problems.  A Crossway official e-mailed me and said they were a work in progress and that they are hoping to make the ESV a popular and beautiful Bible to buy.  I hope so myself.

From this book has come millions of charismatics within mainline denominations such as Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Roman Catholics, and many others.<br />The book is written in a autobiography style with Bennett adding verses of Scripture here and there to help the reader see the teaching of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4).  In short, Father Bennett wants his reader to know that this is indeed an experience with the Spirit but he wants you to see that it is based on Scripture.<br />While you might read this book and not agree with Father Bennett over the Spirit-Baptism, you can't help but to realize how hungry for Jesus we truly need to be and how God wants us to be on fire for Him (Romans 12:11-12; 1 Thess. 5:19).	2004-06-28

It comes in a perfect 14 point print that is easy to read and follow.  The Bible is in verse format and is offset by dark numbers when a new subect falls in the text.  The words of Christ are in red letters which I prefer in black.  This edition does not have cross references although a few do appear at the end of the verses but not many.<br />The negative side of this edition is the size.  It is big and bulky.  You might enjoy having this Bible for study next to your bed or in your office but for Bible teachers this Bible is not for you.  It's weight will wear you down.  Zondervan makes the giant print in a personal size (much smaller than this edition) however they do not have it in any genuine leather formats.  Bonded leather is cheap, fast, but not durable.

It has been a number one best seller even here on Amazon and in the New York Times.  However, the book has some serious flaws.<br />First, the book maintains and promotes a poor theology stemming from an inadequate bibliology.  Verses are used out of context and placed in the author's own context.  Rather than giving a proper exegesis of the biblical passages, Warren takes liberty to twist the text for his own purpose.<br />Second, the book misrepresents and distors the gospel by failing to see the nature of man before regeneration.  Man's purpose, nature, and identity is hostile to God (Eph. 2:1-3), fallen (Genesis 3; Romans 5:12), and totally depraved apart from salvation which is only by God's sovereign grace alone (Eph. 1:3-14).  The book ignores God's holiness, His righteousness, and man's ultimate need of salvation because of our offense toward a holy God (Romans 3:10-27).<br />Third, Warren fails to draw a line between unbelievers and believers.  Only believers enjoy the promises of God (2 Cor. 1:20-21).  No where does God offer promises to unbelievers and assurances of a positive life.<br />Finally, the book is experiential and pragmatic based rather than Scripture driven.  Warren wants to use &quot;40 Days of Purpose&quot; to help change the reader.  However, rather than helping people become totally committed disciples (Luke 14:25-35), Warren wants the reader to &quot;experience&quot; change.  Discipleship is not about experience at all but committment to Jesus Christ and His holy Word no matter how I feel.<br />Not a good book and the reader should avoid it at all costs.  I fear that so many Christians have been duped by the false gospel of Rick Warren and not the true gospel of death given by Jesus (Luke 9:23-25, 57-62).  Jesus bids you to come to Him and die to self (Philippians 3:7-10).	2004-06-27

Rather than embracing the truths we do agree on and evangelizing the world, we spend our time being bitter at others who disagree with non-essentials of our faith.<br />However, I do believe that Christians need to debate the issues in a spirit of grace.  We must not shy away from theological discussions but we must learn to debate them biblically.  That is my main problem with this series from InterVarsity.  While the writers give philisophical reasons for being Calvinists or Arminians, neither necessarily spend much time with the Scriptures.  They debate history, certain theologians such as Augustine or Calvin or Wesley, and even debate with some of their own but they don't go straight to the Bible for their answers.<br />Do Christians need to engage subjects such as Calvinism or Arminism?  Sure!  But do it from the Bible and not from your own personal feelings on the matter.  Our hearts can deceive us (Jeremiah 17:9) and we must base our faith on the Word of God (John 8:31-32; 1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1; 1 John 4:1-2).	2004-06-25

I have not finished it but after seeing all the reviews I thought I would add my name to the growing list.<br />First of all, I did not vote for Clinton in 1992 or 1996.  I was not a supporter (nor am I) of the Democratic party so my review will be bias because that is our nature as Americans and our leadership.  We either love them or hate them it seems.  I for one did not (nor do I) hate Clinton and while I disagreed with him on many issues, I did pray daily for him while he was in office (1 Timothy 2:1-2).<br />Having said this let me now address the book itself.  I found the book so far to be much of what I thought of Clinton as our President.  He had his good and his bad.  He is no doubt a great leader.  He is a great speaker.  However, I don't think he is a very good writer.  In the line of Presidential autobiographies, this book falls short.  I wanted to feel what it was like to be President instead I get boring insights into debates he had while governor of Arkansas.  I wanted to know the day in and day out affairs of running a nation but I get Clinton attacking his former enemies while he was in the White House.<br />Clinton wrote with an agenda but clearly it was not to give his life but more to put in print his feelings about those who sought to attack him while he was in office.<br />Whether you like him or not, he was our President and he did a good job for eight years albeit he lived off the economic flow from Ronald Regan.  Clinton was President of the United States and I still believe it is the greatest nation on earth and even Democrats can agree with that and so I thank him for his service to our great nation.	2004-06-24

The book is an attempt to give a scholarly view on these subjects.  As with many Arminian books on Calvinism, the book addresses other issues of Calvinism such as its history and other matters of doctrine including eternal security (or perseverance of the saints).<br />I do not agree with the last reviewer that this book does not represent a scholarly work.  Although its language is not as technical as Gordon Clark's or other Reformed theologians works on election, the book is a good add to the theological debate.  Further, this edited work by Clark Pinnock represents his &quot;pre-Open theory&quot; days and does not represent his views today.  That is important because many Reformed theologians would simply ignore GRACE UNLIMITED simply because of Pinnock's name.<br />I would urge both sides to read this book and allow grace, truth, and love guide the true disciples of Christ over issues that sometimes can be quite confusing such as the extent of the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ.	2004-06-24

Often we hear of the revivals of Charles Finney and D.L. Moody but do the theology of revivals is often ignored or not discerned.<br />Iain Murray has written this book to look at the later half of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th century concerning revival.  Much of the modern cry for revival comes from this time period and yet sadly so does much of the theology.  Charles Finney, as you will read, is the father of modern pragmatic theology and his followers such as Rick Warren, Bill Hybels, and other church growth &quot;experts&quot; fall into his theology and life.  &quot;If it works, if it brings results then do it&quot; would be Finney's motto.  And that is where the modern evangelical church is today.  Ignore sound doctrine (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1) and give them what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3,4).<br />This should be required reading for all pastors and teachers of God's Word and may God send us a genuine revival that is full of His Word and His glory and not the traditions and teachings of men (Mark 7:1-13).	2004-06-15

The book explores the first eleven chapters of Genesis.  Jacoby takes a theistic evolution approach to Genesis 1-2.  While I differ with him over this issue, Jacoby is clear that he believes God created all things and by His Word they are held together (Hebrews 1:1-3).

I once studied the Bible with several members of the Columbia (SC) Church of Christ and realized very quickly that these guys would not last in their faith if they continued on their works tract.  Sadly, all three of my friends fell away and I put the blame on the ICOC.<br />This book, if you can find it, will help you to see that many in the ICOC are sincere and do love Jesus but they are misguided often and are simply not very good theologians.  Beyond Dr. Douglas Jacoby, the ICOC simply lacks clear, consise theologians.  Templer is an example of this in this book.  He opens each chapter with a Scripture from the NIV and then proceeds to teach off it but his teaching is not from the text but rather he fills the pages of his book with story after story of answered prayers, miracles, and other &quot;faith building&quot; stories.<br />Any book by E.M Bounds, Andrew Murray, Charles Spurgeon, or Leonard Ravenhill on prayer is much better than this one.	2004-05-28

Many of the books, methods, and ideas of the modern evangelical church just did not line up with Scripture.  My first reaction was that I was simply theological ignorant and once I went through Bible college I might could define and defend modern evangelical practices such as altar calls, the &quot;sinner's prayer,&quot; and many other modern tools of evangelism.  However, four years of Bible college did nothing to change my mind.<br />Iain Murray gives us a book that speaks directly to these problems.  Just where did modern altar calls, the &quot;sinner's prayer,&quot; decisions for Christ, and other forms of evangelism come from.  They most surely did not come from the New Testament.  So Murray traces their history and shows the compromise of the evangelical church.  Charles Spurgeon fought the Down-Grade Controversey and now the Church is full of down-graders like Billy Graham, Bill Hybels, and the entire Campus Crusade For Christ.  In fact, go into most evangelical churches and preach against altar calls and you will be stoned before you can reach the door.<br />Read this book and repent for not giving all credit and all glory unto God alone, the author and finisher of our faith (Jonah 2:9; John 6:44; 1 Corinthians 1:30-31; Hebrews 12:2).	2004-05-27

His writings, sermons, and passion for God gives me hope that I too can pursue Jesus with all that is in me.<br /><br />This book is a short biography of Spurgeon and it focuses on the end of his life with the Down-Grade Controversey as well as what happened to Spurgeon's church, Metropolitan Tabernacle, after his death.  It is interesting to see that, despite his preaching and doctrinal teaching to his church, the church abandoned Spurgeon for new models in the early 1900's.  Sadly, the church never has regained the prominence it had in London since the death of Charles Spurgeon.<br /><br />For those who study church growth, this book is a great reminder that only God builds His church.  Churches built by men are doomed for failure!  When Metropolitan Tabernacle gave in to the spirit of the age (Moody, Torrey, Finney) then the church fell.  We must never substitute God's presence for men's traditions (Mark 7:1-13).  May the Church of God be faithful to once again proclaim, as Spurgeon so masterfully did, Christ alone and Him crucified (1 Corinthians 2:1-5).	2004-05-26

Thomas of Master's Seminary ([...]) writes a book that should appeal to cessationist viewpoint of the gifts of the Spirit as found in 1 Corinthians 12-14.  The book is a verse by verse, expositional and theological commentary on these famous chapters that have blessed charismatics and confused non-charismatics.<br />Dr. Thomas takes on the tough questions that 1 Corinthians 12-14 brings to mind especially for those who believe that the manifestation gifts were for the early church only and ceased with the completion of the New Testament canon.  His conclusion is that Paul was writing to correct the Corinthians and while there is application for today from his advice, the sign gifts are no longer in operation as found in the New Testament Church.<br />This book is a great theological book on the cessationist viewpoint but it is tough reading.  Dr. Thomas is a theologian and his writing reflects his earnest committment to that study.  I give this a book a four only because of this difficult nature.

He does a masterful job of presenting strong arguments for an essentially literal transaltion (ESV, NASB, KJV, NKJV, RSV) versus a dynamic equivalent transation (NIV, NLT, the Message, TNIV, NRSV, CEV, TEV).<br />For years I have read and studied from the NIV but always have my doubts and suspisions about the NIV.  Having taken New Testament Greek I was aware of some of the problems I had personally found in the NIV.  When the New Living Translation (NLT) came out in 1996, I bought it and instantly rejected it.  It was simply too free in its translation, too &quot;dumbed&quot; down for me, and simply ignored much of the Greek text.  After reading Dr. Ryken's book, I have found my ammunition for defense of the essentially literal translations.<br />I now enjoy teaching and preaching from the RSV, NKJV, and the NASB.  I would encourage you to pray that the evangelical church hears Dr. Ryken's words of wisdom and returns to a solid literal translation in the heritage of the King James Version.	2004-05-23

Many evangelicals shy away from the RSV mainly due to its usage by more liberal denominations and its endorsement from the Natioanal Council of Churches and not the National Association of Evangelicals.  However, if we evangelicals would take time to read the RSV we might find that we agree with 95% of this Bible.  And the other 5% would not be concerning any major doctrinal issues.<br />Many make an issue with the RSV over its translation of Isaiah 7:14 however the Old Testament text used by the RSV translators was the Septuagent and furthermore the RSV does translate Matthew 1:23 as &quot;virgin.&quot;  The RSV, contrary to popular belief, does in fact teach the virgin birth of Christ.  Nor does the RSV deny the deity of Christ.  While the King James and Revised Standard are based on different New Testament Greek texts and thereby they differ on some texts, both fully agree on the deity of Christ.<br />With the rise of dyamnic-equvalent translations such as the NIV, NLT, The Message, Good News Bible, Contemporary English Bible, and the New Century Version, we evangelicals need to return to essential literal translations such as the RSV, KJV, NKJV, NASB, and the new ESV.

Tenney makes no hesitation to say that he does believe the Bible is the inerrant Word of God from the beginning.  Tenney's work, however, is not a textual commentary on textual criticism.

The Assemblies of God is not a holiness-Pentecostal movement but grew out of mainly ministers from the Baptist, Presbyterian, and Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance churches.  The Assemblies of God stance on entire sanctification is one of progressive sanctification from their Baptistic roots.

His &quot;sacred&quot; text called the Book of Mormon is one of the worst &quot;scriptures&quot; I have ever read.  Its literary value is worthless and it adds nothing to the Bible (except in the many, many places where Smith copied word for word from the King James Bible).<br />This book offers insights into the origins of the Book of Mormon.  David Persuitte is not writing to defend Christianity nor is he writing to tear down Mormonism but is writing a book about the Book of Mormon from an historical and literary point of view.  His conclusion is much to what you would expect of the Book of Mormon, Smith utlizied his ability to tell strange tales about the American Indians, history of pre-Columbus America, and religious works of his day to write the Book of Mormon.<br />If you have never read the Book of Mormon I would encourage you to get a copy of it.  Anyone with a decent knowledge of history and archeology will soon see that Smith's writing is not historical and his &quot;truths&quot; are nothing but lies.<br />For more information see also Fawn Brodie's excellent work NO MAN KNOWS MY HISTORY, Sandra Tanner's MORMONISM: SHADOW OR REALITY, and Stan Larson's THE QUEST FOR THE GOLDEN PLATES.	2004-05-18

This is short book by Kenneth Hagin on divine healing from a Word-Faith perspective.  In the book Hagin seeks to examine many popular Scriptures on healing such as Exodus 15:29; Psalm 103:1-3; Psalm 107:20; Isaiah 53:4-5; Matthew 8:16-17; and 1 Corinthians 12:7-11.<br />Hagin's premise is that divine healing is a promise for all.  Just as one receives salvation by grace through faith and this is for all then so is divine healing since (as Hagin believes) healing is in the atonement.  If people are not healed then it is not God's fault but our own.<br />However this can lead to some legalistic and often dangerous teachings.  If healing doesn't come then often the person becomes wrapped up in perfection, confession of sin and the Word (positive confession) and doubt creeps into their minds and undermines their faith in a sovereign God.<br />Does God heal today?  Yes!  Does God promise to heal all?  No!  For a complete treatment of healing see the following books:<br />Michael Brown, ISRAEL'S DIVINE HEALER<br />Richard Mayhue, THE HEALING PROMISE	2004-05-17

I believe you should first read the man's works before making a final judgement.<br />Having said this, this book exposes the true errors of speculation apart from Scripture.  What happened between the cross and the throne is not relevant!  Jesus' death and His blood being poured our for our forgiveness and then rising on the third day is (Matthew 1:21; 26:28; John 19:30; Acts 2:22-24; 17:30-31; Romans 4:24-5:11; 10:9-10; Eph. 1:7; Titus 2:11-15; 3:5-7; Hebrews 9:14, 27-28; Revelation 1:5-6).  To create stories and so called revelations about Jesus entering hell and taking the keys from the devil's hands only leads to more and more chaotic teachings.<br />Friends, stay true to Scripture (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1).  Avoid speculations (2 Peter 1:16-21).  Stay grounded in God's eternal word and you will never fail (2 Peter 3:17-18).

This work on Hebrews has proven to be his best in the series.<br />Many commentaries on the Bible often give theological meaning and offer insights into the passages but Dr. MacArthur does both and gives us a devotional commentary as well.  He maintains this in Hebrews.  Dr. MacArthur explains the text, draws key theological insights and even dissagreements (such as Hebrews 6:4-9), and yet combines evangelical scholarship with easy to read and grasp language.  All Greek words are transliterated for those who have a limited knowledge of Greek (which is most of us).<br />Further, Dr. MacArthur's outlines are great.  Any preacher would value the expository outlines of each chapter and subject that Dr. MacArthur is dealing with in all these commentaries.  I urge you to buy them all if possible.	2004-05-16

However, I was dissappointed and took the book back for a refund.<br />My main problem with the book is while Olson does give both sides of the issues he often chooses the Calvinist side.  I don't mind that too much but he tends to choose the dispensational views of grace held by Chafer, Ryrie, and Zane Hodges.  For example, in his chapter on salvation Olson dives into the Lordship issue of salvation.  However, he quickly chooses the anti-Lordship view and then tries to offer biblical justification for doing so.  Obviously, he fails at it.<br />Rather than mediating between the two views, Olson should have just written a systematic theology book on his own and not try to get both camps to buy his book.<br />I would recommend Wayne Grudem's SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY or Stanley Horton's SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY over this work.

However, few understand the passion and heart in this man.  In this book, A METHOD FOR PRAYER, Henry's love for Jesus, passion for prayer, and love of Scripture can clearly be seen.<br />The book is divided into different methods of prayer.  In each chapter Henry offers some insights but mainly fills the pages with prayers (which the Puritans were noted for writing down their prayers; see THE VALLEY OF VISION) and with Scriptures.  Nearly every chapter contains over 50 passages of Scripture that Henry prayed.<br />My only reason for not giving this book a solid 5 stars is that it is difficult to read the chapters and keep flipping to the end of the chapter for the Scripture references since the editor did not include them in the prayers and teachings of Henry.  The language is updated and this earns the book a good 4 star.	2004-05-16

This book should be a required reading text for every disciple of Christ.<br />Murray's chapters are short, concise, and he fills your heart with a hunger for God's presence.  While his writing style may be dated and his language archaic at times, Murray's passion for prayer shines through.  He truly takes you to the school of prayer and leads you before the throne of Almight God.<br />If you love to pray, struggle with prayer, or want to learn the secrets of the saints of old who spread God's truth without technology but their voices and their Bibles then read Andrew Murray's classic works on prayer.	2004-05-16

Notice I said &quot;biblical&quot; because this book does a wonderful job of presenting the Bible is the sole authority for faith and practice.  Every worldview from politics to feminism is examined in the light of Scripture.  Because this book makes the Bible its source for divine truth and authority, the writers avoid their opinions and give us God's view of a world gone mad.<br />This is a great book and I would encourage all full time servants to purchase this book and seek to understand a biblical worldview not tarnished by politics, money, or sin.	2004-05-16

He does so, not by attacking Arminians, but by looking at all five points of Calvinism and then going to the Scriptures to see if they are there.  Being a Calvinist theologian, Dr. White finds much evidence for all five points of Calvinism.<br />Whether you are a Calvinist or not, you will learn from reading this book about the doctrines of grace and the biblical basis for Calvinism.	2004-05-15

It does represent the only classical Pentecostal single volume commentary available.<br />The commentary has many positives.  For one, unlike the notes on the Life in the Spirit Study Bible, the notes found here are from various Pentecostal scholars.  This helps avoid one man's views versus another.  Further, the notes reflect firm convictions concerning the authority of Scripture, the inerrancy of Scripture, and a firm belief in the supernatural power of God.<br />The only draw back to the commentary is that it lacks a good expository outline of the New Testament books and uses the NIV for its main text.  I would prefer a literal translation such as the NASB or NKJV (see my review of the Life in the Spirit Study Bible).	2004-05-08

His preaching does nothing for me,  his books are shallow, and he teaches a false view of grace (Jude 3-4).  However, I will not bash him per se in this review.  I will however take aim at his book.<br />Dr. Stanley's tretise is that we are eternally secure based on the finished work of Christ.  He goes further to teach a radical view of eternal security that many other Calvinist including John MacArthur would deny.  He teaches that salvation is based on faith alone and God promises to keep us eternally.  Therefore, the individual is not the focus but the focus is God's promise.  God will keep all who come to Jesus for salvation (John 6:37).  Even if the &quot;believer&quot; denies the faith, they will still go to heaven because of God's unconditional love and promise to keep us forever.<br />For the sake of time, let me simply say that this leads to messy and cheap grace.  Rather than teaching Titus 2:11-12, Stanley gives false hope to anyone who simply believed (1 John 2:24; Revelation 3:10).  Dr. Stanley allows his own theology to effect his exegesis of nearly every eternal security passage.<br />Good books to read along with this are:<br />MacArthur, John HARD TO BELIEVE<br />MacArthur, John THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS &amp; FAITH WORKS<br />Shank, Robert LIFE IN THE SON &amp; ELECT IN THE SON<br />Corner, Dan THE BELIEVER'S CONDITIONAL SECURITY<br />White, James THE SOVEREIGN GRACE OF GOD<br />Wiley, H.

The book does not deal with demons or the demonic realm as much as he deals with the person of Satan.  The book covers nearly every Scripture on Satan and exposes his lies, his tactics, and how to defeat him through Christ.<br />One of the best things about this book is that Dr. Mayhue does not spend time chasing dreams and men's ideas about Satan.  Too much confusion exists about the Enemy and most comes from strange (even unbiblical) ideas about Satan.  Dr. Mayhue avoids this and simply gives us a biblical view of Lucifer.	2004-05-06

His focus in his books is always based on his personal feelings and not objective reasoning.  As is the case with this book on the Updated New American Standard (NASB).<br />It is true that throughout the book you get the feeling that Vance is upset that modern translations are replacing his beloved King James Version.  Therefore Vance writes to try to persuade you to stay with the KJV over the modern translations.  This book, unlike other KJV only books, does not pick on the NIV or the NKJV but he sticks with the NASB.  He probably does this because, while the NIV is the best selling, the NASB is famed as the most literal Bible around.  In our Greek classes in Bible college we used the NASB because of its literal translation.<br />The book dives into the history of the NASB and then proceeds to compare the 1977 NASB to the update 1995 NASB.  I personally like this.  In fact, I still prefer the 1977 NASB over the updated NASB simply because of the literallness of the 1977.  The book ends with Vance trying his best to trash the NASB.  However, he fails to deal with this in a scholarly fashion but likens himself to the KJV only camp with personal and irrational attempts to discredit the NASB.  He fails.<br />Buy the NASB but more than that live it!	2004-05-01

He then takes his own personal experience and begins to read it into various passages of Scripture.  The problem is that Coppin allows his own experience to direct his interpretations rather than allowing Scripture to interpret his experience.

It is a tool that allows us to pull away the blinders of the present day altar call system of the evangelical church and presents a biblical critique of the system.  Murray, while Reformed in his own theology, stays true to his tast and offers the reader biblical proof that the altar call system is a created system by men.  It comes from a pragmatic view of evangelism that emphasises numbers above true coversions.  It has come to us from Charles Finney to Billy Graham.<br />My hope is that every Christian will read this book and understand that the altar calls, the &quot;sinner's prayer,&quot; and other forms of mass evangelism are not found in the Bible.  Discipleship, however, is but then again that will cost you (Luke 14:25-35) and we don't want to pay a price for anything, especially salvation (Titus 1:16; Jude 3-4).	2004-04-16

Various other Pentecostal scholars also worked on the study Bible including prestigious scholars such as Dr. Stanley Horton, Dr. French Arrington, and Dr. Robert Shank.<br />My only complaints against the Full Life is that the notes were written by one man so they are not as plentiful as say the NIV Study Bible.  I also would favor a more literal translation such as the NASB or the NKJV then the NIV although I am not opposed to the NIV.  The study notes reflect the theology of the classical Pentecostal movement.

This book attacks nearly every Christian tradition from the modern pastoral system to the buildings built called &quot;churches.&quot;  Edwards uses practical sense, Scripture, and church history to show the fallicy of today's modern church.<br />The book comes across as an attack on the modern church and it is.  Edwards makes no claims that he is not attacking the system.  One of his quotes is from a Turkish proverb that says, &quot;If you tell the truth when everyone is believing and practicing the opposite, you better have a fast horse.&quot;  Most &quot;pastors&quot; and clergy (and those who support them) will not like Edwards nor his book since it attacks their careers.<br />In conclusion, this book is best read by those who are not afraid to question the modern church (1 Thess. 5:21).

The Assemblies of God continues to move ahead of the other Pentecostal movements by seeking to introduce their doctrines by great books such as this book.<br />This book is a commentary on the Letters by Paul to the Corinthians.  Most of the interpretation of this book will be soundly evangelical in its makeup with the exception of Horton's views on 1 Corinthians 12-14.  Here is where this book is worth the price.  You will find one of the best (and deepest) treatments on the gifts of the Spirit and their usage from 1 Corinthians 12-14 that I have ever seen from Pentecostal material.<br />My only drawback with this book is the constant usage of the New International Version which is a great translation but I would prefer using several different translations to help bring us closer to the original text.  Also, Dr. Horton, being an Assemblies of God clergy, is careful not to attack the denominational world despite the denominational churches failure to deal with 1 Corinthians 11.<br />...	2002-08-16

Now retired, Dr. Palma was a distinguished professor at the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, MO (AGTS).<br />This book offers a much deeper and more theological position of the Assemblies of God on the person and work of the Holy Spirit.  Most of this book was originally published in a small book form simply entitled THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT.  Several new chapters were added on the person of the Spirit and hence this book.<br />This is a technical book and a person not fimiliar with theology or theological terms would not enjoy this book.  Dr. Palma also is a Greek scholar and will inject word studies in his chapters that so need them.<br />One of the main reasons to buy this book is Dr. Palma's dealing with the initial, physical evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit (which he defines as speaking in tongues).  Dr. Palma seeks to offer another approach to initial evidence while remaining classical Pentecostal in his approach.  He also challanges the Pentecostal interpretation of John 20:22 as the new birth of the eleven disciples of Christ.<br />You will enjoy this book if you are seeking a deeper theological position on the Pentecostal view of the person and work of the Spirit.	2002-08-16

His writings are clear, biblical, and easy to follow.  His word usuage is great and he avoids utalizing his vast information to overwhelm his readers.<br />This book is a classic on the person and work of the Holy Spirit.  Horton writes as a classical Pentecostal and he strongly believes that we need a sound understanding of the Holy Spirit in order to effectively minister in these last days.<br />The book covers the entire biblical teaching on the Holy Spirit from Genesis to Revelation.  Dr. Horton breaks the study down into various themes from creation to salvation.  His insights into the work of the Spirit in the Old Testament are great as well as his writing on the gifts of the Spirit in the church today.<br />While I did not fully agree with all of Dr. Horton's writing in this book, I do believe this is a must read for any person studying the Pentecostal view of the Holy Spirit.	2002-08-16

Williams dives into the Scriptures and examines the modern salvation teachings of &quot;just believe&quot;, &quot;the sinner's prayer&quot; and &quot;altar calls.&quot;  Williams does not write with a harsh tone or bitter spirit but he writes as a broken man (1 Peter 3:15-16).<br />The book ends by revealing what the true gospel of Christ is.  I will let you read the book to discover this wonderful truth that will set you free from sin (John 8:31-36).<br />If you are an evangelical who is searching for sound teaching on salvation or maybe you are a curious about Christianity than I encourage you to read and study this book with an open Bible and an open mind.

The authors also do a good job of sharing various Christians stories and experiences with the Holy Spirit.<br />My only reason for giving this book four stars instead of five is the authors failed to deliver a strong charismatic theology and they did not present other Christians approach to being filled/baptized with the Holy Spirit.

Viola is a great read and his style is not offensive or demening to those outside of the house church movement.  I myself happen to be still in an instutional church and find Viola to be refreshing and a good writer.<br />This book dives into what RETHINKING THE WINESKINS begin.  Viola looks at the current leadership model (CEO-type professional clergy  or &quot;pastors, ministers, or priests&quot;) and examines the practice in light of the New Testament model of Jesus in Matthew 20:20-28.  He offers clear exposition from the Bible and practical insights from his own experiences in house churches.<br />I believe its time for us to reexamine leadership in the modern church.  I am tired of seeing professionally trained men come to lead churches when we need to return to the biblical model and allow the Holy Spirit to lead His church.  While its clear that God desires to have leaders in the Church (Titus 1:5; 1 Peter 5:2-5), we need to ask the question of how many leaders, where should these leaders be chosen from, and who qualifies as a leader in the NT Church?	2002-08-10

This book is devoted, in love, to helping religious people see the truth of what the Bible teaches about baptism.  Written in an easy to understand format, this book explores nearly every NT text on baptism, looks at several religious and denominational teachings on salvation such as &quot;the sinner's prayer&quot; or &quot;praying Jesus into your heart.&quot;  Geissler also has added two appendixes on what the early church fathers taught about baptism and also an examination of the Greek text of Matthew 28:19.<br />My only reason for not giving this book a 5 star is that Geissler is part of the International Churches of Christ.  While I admire the ICOC for its zeal and unity, I have to also add that they hold an unbiblical view of authority and also hold to some traditions of men such as their clergy/laity system (for more on this see Frank Viola's book Rethinking the Wineskins and also Who Is Your Covering?).	2002-07-18

Dr. Dyer's book on baptism is a good book, if you hold that baptism is a mere ceremony in the life of the believer.  I found the book to be simple to read and Dr. Dyer deals with the mode, subjects, and purpose of baptism quite well.<br />My only problems with this book was Dr. Dyer's insistence that while baptism should be the believers first act of obedience to Christ, he never tells us why.  He defends believers' baptism but then attacks baptismal regeneration by insisting that a believer need not be baptized to be saved yet if they truly are saved, writes Dyer, then they will be baptized.  This is confusing to me since the NT knows nothing of an unbaptized Christian, which Dyer would agree with, but then he claims you can still be a Christian without baptism.<br />I do recommend this book but I do also recommend that you read this with your Bible open and ready to test all things by the inspired Scriptures (1 Thess. 5:21).	2002-07-12

I must admit that this book is very technical and if you are not familiar with Greek than you may want to avoid this book.<br />Dunn's main premise is that the Baptism in the Holy Spirit did occur in Acts as a &quot;second work of grace&quot; but this is only part of Jesus' plan of evangelism and conversion (Acts 1:8).  The dramatic Spirit-Baptisms were simply God giving His sign of approval upon their conversions.  Thus Dunn views the Baptism in the Spirit as a conversion/initiation experience (1 Cor. 12:13).<br />Dunn's book has become the standard reply by non-Pentecostals and non-charismatics.  The book was written in 1970 and has since become standard reading in many evangelical colleges.  Even those who do not ascribe to Dunn hold to his theological approach in explaining Spirit-Baptisms in Acts.	2002-03-30

His heart and his passion were in preaching the word of God and secondly in teaching it.  This book does a bit of both.<br />I greatly appreciated Edward's desire to exegete major passages of Scripture dealing with justification.  While Edwards does a good job in presenting strong biblical arguments for justification by faith alone he also provides a great deal of warning to those who desire to live a life of sin and indifference.  He offers sinners the grace of God and he offers Christians the holiness of God.<br />This book is worth the purchase.  If you have not read or studied the works of Jonathan Edwards, I would encourage you to begin here.  His knowledge of the Bible was incrediable but his heart is best shown in this book that deals with a doctrine he faithfully preached and loved.	2002-03-16

I was intrigued by the various aspects of ancient life that Joseph Smith describes in the Book of Mormon from their cities to their great battles to even their coinage, food, and animals (including elephents, horses, sheep, cows).  I wondered who was right since I have been taught by non-LDS antropologist that none of the above listed in the Book of Mormon has been found.<br />Then I bought this book.  This book is both the story and the findings of Stuart Ferguson in his search for archeological remains of various Book of Mormon listings.  He begins his search in Central America (the most common area believed by Mormons to be the site of the Book of Mormon accounts).  The books is neither pro-Mormon nor anti-Mormon but is simply Ferguson's own pursuit of the truth.  What he finds will amaze you!<br />The book also deals with Ferguson's desire to know the truth concerning the papyrus that Joseph Smith claimed to have translated from Egyptian into the Books of Abraham and Joseph (although he did not publish the Book of Joseph).  Modern Egyptianologist have since disproven Smith and his &quot;translation&quot; of the papyrus but Ferguson was bent on disproving the modern findings in favor of Smith.  Again, his findings will amaze you.<br />Whether you are a Mormon or not, this book will offer great insight into not accepting the standard answers for faith but willing to search out evidences for your faith and religion to see if they are objectable and clear.

Anyone interested in a Christian view of various LDS doctrines will find them addressed in this book.  The book reads like a letter since this is suppose to be a fictional encounter between Dr. White and an LDS missionary (elder).<br />Many &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; books are written in harsh tones.

I wish the same could be true of many Mormon books I've read against critics of the LDS Church.<br />Finally, if you are a Mormon, please be willing to investigate your faith.  Don't settle for your religion simply because you &quot;believe&quot; it is true or were raised that way.

Dr. White does a marvelous job of presenting his arguments apart from the negative spirit so often given by those from the King James Only camp.<br />I read Rev. Cloud's book in one night.  It is easy to read but Cloud does lack the apologetic abilities of Dr. White nor does he even try to grasp the original Hebrew or Greek as Dr. White does.  His arguments are usually based on his own theological assumption and that is that the KJV is the only Bible for today and it alone (even above the Greek manuscripts) speaks for God.  This theological assumption keeps him from examining the ancient texts for the Bible nor does he wrestle with contextual issues as Dr. White does in his book.<br />So, if you are looking for another voice and another view of the King James Only debate, buy this book.

While it is nice to see that there are those in the instutionalized churches that see the need for reformation, I see a greater need in restoration.  The modern Americanized church has become so filled with business ethics and principles that we have missed the clear New Testament teaching on servant leadership, authority, and the eternal purpose of the Church.<br />This book will offer you great insights into the cell movement.  I would highly recommend this book if you are curious about how cell churches operate.  If you are apart of a cell church and are still struggling with the clergy/laity system of most American churches (including cell groups) than I would encourage you to check out Frank Viola's book \\"Rethinking The Wineskins\\" (...).<br />The message in this book is clear, the church needs to change the world instead of the world changing the church.  We must seek to return to a biblical model and pattern for the Church.	2001-11-30

I have often struggled with the current model we have of the American church.  The traditions we hold so dear are so often not based on clear New Testament teachings.  I have longed for a church where &quot;one another&quot; passages are lived out, where accountability is strong, where the pastor is not a CEO but a servant, where leaders are biblically chosen and where the Church is not divided on various theological camps.  The only place to usually find this, sadly to say, is in cults (where the gospel is not preached in its power or truth).<br />Banks will offer you hope if you are like me and you are burned out on &quot;church as usual.&quot;  He will challange you to examine Scripture with fresh insights into house churches in their historical context.  He will challange your notion of &quot;Church&quot; in our westernized thinking and will lead you to a biblical and fresh restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ.  We must move away from the Institutionalized church and return to the New Testament pattern that Banks gives in detail in this book.	2001-11-30

He and I had been discussing Mormonism versus Christianity. Rather than debating many of the strange Mormon doctrines that have been taught over its 200 year history, I decided to stay with one subject: historical validity of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon the foundation of the Mormon faith and the cornerstone of their religion. He said that a man could get closer to God by obeying its precepts above any other book on earth. Smith also claimed that it was the most correct of any book on the earth. I challanged my Mormon friend to find my one evidence for the Book of Mormon to be taken as historically acurate. Mind you, I did not ask him to prove to me its theological content but only its historical content for if its historical content cannot be proven, why believe what it says theologically? He brought me this book. I read it in three days, marked it up pretty good, and brought it back to my Mormon friend. My conclusions: the LDS Church still is serching for historical evidence for the Book of Mormon. I have here in front of me a copy of a statement put out by both the Smithsonian Institute and the LDS leaders. The Smithsonian letter denies the content of the book of Mormon as being historical and views the material as only religious in nature with no archeological evidence to support its claims. The LDS leaders, in reply, ask &quot;Why question what the Lord has decided to keep hidden?&quot; I for one question. I question all things (1 Thess. 5:21). I am not a Christian because I have prayed and feel its right, I am a Christian because of historical evidence to support the claims of the Bible (2 Peter 1:16-21). Christianity alone is the only religion based not on the teachings of Jesus as much as on the historical evidence of Jesus' death and resurrection. Buy this book. Read it. Study it. But don't believe something simply because someone tells you its true. I believe I can fly btu that does not mean its true. My subjective truth will hit objective reality when I test it. Do that with Christianity, Mormonism, Islam, etc. You will find Jesus to be true (John 14:6).believe I can fly btu that does not mean its true.

While Viola's book seem to have an heir about it that said &quot;I'm ticked off at the established church and here is why&quot; this book simply offers the reader a candid look at the New Testament model of house churches and how the Bank's are seeking to follow the NT pattern. Bank's is a scholar. You will find in this book a man who loves God, loves people, and teaches the truth of Scripture clearly. If you have read books on house churches and have walked away with a bit of skepticism (as I have at times) than buy this book and you will find that Bank's is truly a brother in Christ who only desires to be like Jesus.	2001-08-25

The book explores the house church movement from a biblical (and somewhat historical) viewpoint.<br />I found that I agreed with much of what Viola stated.  I am a &quot;paid clergy&quot; in that I'm a full-time youth pastor nevertheless, I found that I agreed with Viola that the church is not a business but is the BODY of Christ.  God works through the entire body and not only through &quot;professional&quot; Christians.  All Christians are called to share their faith (Mark 16:15) and bear fruit (John 15:8).  This book will teach you how house churches effectively reach unbelievers with the gospel.<br />If you believe in today's modern system of &quot;church&quot; and you are a lazy Christian who thinks we should pay someone to do all the work of the ministry (Eph. 4:11-16) than you will not like this book.

While I am not a complete cessasionist, I believe Dr. MacArthur's book challenges disciples to wrestle with the Word of God when it comes to the person and work of the Holy Spirit.  It is vital that we hold firmly to sound doctrine and not embrace subjective views regarding the Holy Spirit.  I believe it is time for Pentecostals to return to the foundation of the inerrant and infallible Word of God.<br /><br />I found this book to be an excellent read.  Being a former Pentecostal pastor, I found that I did not fully agree with Dr. MacArthur's positions on some teachings but I found myself agreeing that the Pentecostal/Charasmatic movement must return to the clear teachings of Scripture (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1).  As a Pentecostal, I attended a non-Pentecostal Bible college that gave me a deep love for the Bible, a longing for more of Jesus in my life, but a devotion to clear Biblical interpretation and teachings.<br /><br />This book will force you, if you are a Pentecostal, to wrestle with the Word of God and will challange you to understand, defend, and clearly teach what you believe.	2001-08-21

His teachings reflected mainline and historical Christianity.  His passion was to see those in cults freed by the power of God to live as Jesus taught us to live (John 8:31-32, 36).<br />As you will see from this book, the Jehovah Witnesses system does not stand when compared to the Bible.

As a teacher, pastor, and theologian, Chafer brought to the Body of Christ a desire to teach God's truth by God's Spirit.<br />This book is not one of my favorite Chafer books.  While I have no problem reading books that I disagree with, I did find that this book was quite boring and shallow in its teaching on the holiness of the believer.<br />Chafer outlines in this book his defense of &quot;no-Lordship&quot; salvation.  That is that one can become a Christian but never move beyond mere mental belief in the facts of the gospel.  He proposes that those who are spiritual (that is sold out to Jesus) mustn't judge those who appear to not be.  God alone is the judge (Matthew 7:1) so let the Holy Spirit lead them to a deeper relationship with Himself (John 6:44).<br />For a balanced and biblical view of &quot;Lordship&quot; salvation please see John MacArthur's book &quot;The Gospel According To Jesus&quot; and &quot;Faith Works.&quot;	2001-08-21

I walked away longing for people to be sovereignly saved.  I walked away challanged to be holy as God is holy (1 Peter 1:15-16).<br />I bought this book before I went to Brownsville.  I knew that Hanegraaff was having some problems with the so called &quot;revival movements.&quot;  I too was having those problems.<br />What did I learn?  This book will call you to study the Word of God.  Revival must be based on the clear teachings of Scripture.  I fully stand with Hanegraaff on this issue.  Nevertheless, I did not like the &quot;spirit&quot; which seems to be in this book (as opposed to Christianity In Crisis).  While I felt that there was (and still is) a great need for men like Hank to call the Body of Christ back to the Bible but we must do this in a spirit of humility (2 Timothy 2:24-25).<br />I would encourage you to read this book but continue to pray for revival.

The story of Jimmy Swaggat captures my heart because I too am an Assemblies of God pastor.  I too have seen the fall of many sincere Christians because they got focused on power, money, greed, sex, or anything other than preaching the Word of God (Col. 3:16).<br />This book offers the reader an inside view of the life of Jimmy Swaggart.  It is rather long though from his family background until Swaggart becomes the world famous evangelist he was to be prior to his fall into sin.<br />The details of the sexual fall of Swaggart are troublesome for those who are not use to strong sexual language.  The negatives of this book is that Seaman does use offensive language at times and she is very harsh on Pentecostals and other conservative Christians.  Seaman, at times, seeks to put the blame not on Swaggart himself but upon the Assemblies of God and the Church of Jesus Christ.  This of course is not the case for anyone who is committed to being a true disciple.<br />One final note, I do not doubt Swaggart started out with a sincere heart for people and for God but he allowed his unconfessed sins and unrepentance to keep him from obeying God.  Be sure, the Bible says, yours sins will find you out.  And in the end, God exposed Swaggart to the world but thankfully we serve a sinless Savior.  As Jim Elliott once wrote, &quot;We are all nobodies seeking to glorify somebody.&quot;	2001-08-15

The ICC is one of the fastest growing movements in the world starting with only 30 in 1979 to over 200,000 today.  Led by Kip McKean and the Los Angeles Church of Christ, it is a powerful force to be reckoned with.<br />This book exposes the trouble that legalism brings.  Those who are seeking to save themselves and justify themselves before God (Romans 3:22-27) will find life a struggle.  Freedom is just a word used in &quot;Christian&quot; language but seldom have I met ICC people who are truly free in Jesus (Gal. 5:1, 13).<br />This book will help you to see what is like to be a disciple in the International Churches of Christ.  If you are in the movement, know someone who is, or you are just curious about the ICC, this book will be an eye opener at mind control and legalism.  Jesus brings freedom from sin through His grace (Eph. 1:7; 2:8-10) but those in this book were introduced to religion of men (Mark 7:1-8).<br />If you are a true Christian than you will praise God for His mercy and grace when you are done with this book (Romans 4:5).

Thompson is a poor exegesis of Scripture, knows no Hebrew nor Greek yet sometimes utalizes them to benefit his teachings, and ignores the Sovereignty of God for a God who is controlled by human beings words.<br />The one truth Thompson hits on is that God does love us and He wants to bless us but he does not emphasize that God has blessed us in Christ already (Eph. 1:3), with or without money!

Most Oneness pastors I have met are very uneducated and not very biblically trained.<br />This book reflects the Oneness position that one must be baptized in water, by immersion, in Jesus' name ONLY for salvation.  Of course, in the Oneness theological position, this still does not constitute salvation but is part of the &quot;steps&quot; of salvation.  After being baptized in Jesus' name only, one must still be baptized in the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues or one is not a Christian.<br />Therefore, argues Bernard, those who are not baptized in Jesus' name only and who have not received the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues, are lost.  Ironically, this means that the Oneness movement (that begain in 1914) are the only Christians alive today and for nearly 2000 years, the Church was in the dark concerning the truth of salvation.  Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Wesley, Charles Spurgeon, D.L Moody, Peter Cartwright, A.W. Tozer, Jonathan Edwards, and many others are lost and in hell for not being baptized in Jesus' name only and they did not biblically receive the Holy Ghost (or so the logic goes).<br />This book deals with manily water baptism (baptismal regeneration) and argues against the traditional Trinitarian formula found in Matthew 28:19.	2001-08-14
