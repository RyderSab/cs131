I'm in the medical field - I've been a nurse for 27 years and I've only run across 5 or 6 such individuals ala intersexual'<br /><br />and it's a rare, rare book indeed that can carry on such an intellectual discussion on this condition.<br /><br />What I learned that I valued the most is that modern western medics and nurses and parents should act in haste when encountering such a special person.<br /><br />Sexual ambiguity is what it is....medical people were well-meaning when they saught to correct it, but they possibly could have destroyed the true gender identity of a intersexed individual.<br /><br />Living in the enlightened society of today, with western modern standards, there is a lot less \\"fear\\" associated with intersexed persons.....more facination than fear anyhow.<br /><br />This book is very intellectual - but understandable by the average college-read person.  I encourage all persons who have become aware of this 'condition' to pick up this fine book - read it - and learn a bushel-full of facts regarding hermaphrodites and the various 'forms' people come equipped with. I have only yet begun to understand that this condition may be more prevelant than ever considered before.<br /><br />This is a very facinating book and it comes with my highest recommendation for a truly underrepresented topic.	2005-08-07

Had this book been less technical and more anecdotal, I would have awarded the author, Nancy Segal, PhD a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Alas - it is very dry due to her habit of citing research study after research study - then of course, a long explanation regarding percentages.  whew *  Lends to very dry reading indeed.<br /><br />  Not to ignore the fact that there are many interesting facts that Dr. Segal presents in her studious little book in regards to identical twins versus fraternal twins.  The sad reality is that the identical twins grab the spotlight most of the time because of their uncanny similarities that really impress!<br /><br />Identical twins are the closest thing to CLONES that the world can ever see, and for this - Dr. Segal discusses numerous arguements that support the claim.<br /><br />  She discussed many cases of identical twins...some raised in the same home, some raised in different homes.  What I am so sorry that SHE DID NOT INCLUDE were the world-famous identical twins, Ronald and Richard Herrick.<br /><br />They were the first persons ever to successfully undergo kidney donorship and transplantation in the world - - - way back in 1954.  Richard was only 24 when glomerulonephritis placed him in kidney failure and he was weeks away from a certain death.<br /><br />His doctors had warned the family to put his affairs in order, because he was doomed to die so prematurely.<br /><br />But then they learned that Richard had an identical twin brother, Ronald.  THey agreed to attempt the transplant and it worked!!!  I would have loved to hear Segals' spin on this amazing story - it changed the medical world overnight!<br /><br />  She does compare lots of data on natural identical twins, identical twins spaced by years by artificial insemination, superfecated twins, step-twins, near-twins and also some discusson on identical triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets.<br /><br />A small discussion is included for the famous Dilley septuplets.<br /><br />There is a frightening chapter on conjoined twins and their sad stories.<br /><br />  OVerall this was a very excellent book and I learned alot from it.  334 pages of twin trivia and facinating facts are contained within.

Besides the biggie of their parents dying in a mysterious fire, they are forced to live with their terrible uncle, Count Olaf, who is a real terror and he's super mean.<br /><br />It gets even edgier when the Count demands that 14 year old virgin Violet marry him so that he can get his miserable hands on the Children's fortune...this is a ghastly plot twist that reeks of pedophilia or incest, but then again,<br /><br />the Brothers Grimm made that an essential ingredient to their story telling formulas.<br /><br />No - Violet is saved in the end by clever Klaus and the happy ending shows Count being arrested and chased far away.<br /><br />The enduring lesson here is that the three siblings strongly have learned to help one another and were able to creatively problem-solve when the going got very very rough.<br /><br />It's a wonderful lesson to prove, that one is never defeated when united with hearts filled with love.<br /><br />I am energized to continue reading the entire modern literary library of this amazing author, Lemony Snicket.<br /><br />Or at least, I have bought the first three books and plan on reading together with my 9 year old....it's fun and it's<br /><br />entertaining and much has been learned by reading this modern tale of plots that entertained people for many, many years.<br /><br />Read this book and see if it doesn't work for you.<br /><br />The warnings are just silly fun from the author - - - he warns that the book is unpleasant, but it's a fun book to read - honest!<br /><br />Good literature in times where American Literature is somewhat sparse to find./>The warnings are just silly fun from the author - - - he warns that the book is unpleasant, but it's a fun book to read - honest! <br />Good literature in times where American Literature is somewhat sparse to find.	2005-01-03

Alan Shepard was the first American man in space - this occured on May 5th, 1961 with John F. Kennedy in office.  I find it amazing that it took 43 long years to finally get some semblence of the affair in writing.  Well, like the old saying goes - better late than never.<br /><br />Author, Neal Thompson did an excellent job of explaining the growing up years of one of the most famous aviators in the world, Alan B. Shepard.  He was courageous enough to print the truth about the man who was supremely confident in his physical as well as intellectual abilities.  But all great men have their downfalls, as is well-documented in this book.<br /><br />The first man in space may have only been up there for 15 minutes, but it was this brief shining moment of accurate performing that launched the legend that is Alan Shepard.  He conquered Meniere's disease by having to first conquer and overcome his (bogus) Christian Science faith - - - and - - - no surprise, he was cured under the famous healing hand of Dr. House in Los Angeles.<br /><br />I was intrigued to discover he almost commanded Apollo 13, but was reassigned to the next mission instead, due to preparation contingencies.  This decision saved Shepard the near-disasterous mission that we know occured on Apollo 13 - what a close call! Shepard always did display this lucky streak that never stopped.<br /><br />He also might have been up on Apollo 1 - but his ear problem started around that time and he was grounded.<br /><br />It's as if a higher power was looking out for him and doing creative things to keep Shepard alive and well.<br /><br />His ride was on Apollo 14; he was the commander and he did another perfect job, what else is new?  What else did we expect from Alan Shepard?<br /><br />His wife, Louise stood by his side, in good times and in bad for 50 years - she had a lot of competition out there with the Rocket groupies.  Not to mention the stress of living with a high risk occupation. But he always managed to call her at 5:00pm most nights, except for those times he was staying at the Apollo Motel # 14.<br /><br />This book was so interesting and mesmerizing - I read it non-stop for 2 days.....all 399 pages of it.<br /><br />I could not put it down - I even drug it to work with me today.<br /><br />There are some nice photographs in there, but I would like to see about 1000 more of the life and times of Alan Shepard.<br /><br />Some people are born to live lives of extreme risk, challenge  and unbelievable success.....and the rest of us can only imagine what it must have felt like to be in their shoes.<br /><br />Shepard's life was very exciting indeed, and I wonder why on Earth did it take 43 years for this wonderful book to be published?  THe truth may be a painful and bitter thing to taste, but it's the way things panned out in real life.<br /><br />They had a huge ego and they stroked that ego one times too many.  Why do risk takers take so many risks?  Well, I suppose it comes with the territory of being a risk taker in the first place.<br /><br />TODAY ---All of our famous Apollo astronaughts are aging; many have passed on to the big rocket ship in the sky, so reading about these incredible men and the incredible lives they lived is a real treat for all persons who wonder about such immense challenges.  It is my sincere hope that all of them have books published about their biographies...they have lived and dared to fulfill outrageous dreams.  THey are what make this country great in the eyes of the universe.<br /><br />Before long, the Apollo moon walkers will be gone from the face of this beautiful blue Earth.<br /><br />We need to know them - at least by biographies - we need to hear thier stories and understand their feelings before their ultimate count-down to zero is counted.<br /><br />Please read this book!  It's an excellent book!<br /><br />It's the year 2004 and I can now say I know alot more about this man that held the facination of millions.....Alan Shepard - he was a great man who did great things, and lived life to the fullest possible..	2004-10-14

This is a thought-provoking book about a genius who developed the first working rocket on Earth.  Dr. Robert Goddard was a mystery man; he was a loner but had close ties with Charles Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, and Werner von Braun.  He is credited with the raw invention of modern rocketry; although the credit may have been stolen from him with the utilization of the crude but warworthy V-2 rockets developed by the Germans.<br /><br />The problem with Goddard is that he wanted all the patents to belong to him and all the credit go to him, but when it came to sharing his wealth of knowledge, he became secretive.<br /><br />It outraged many people, including his own government.<br /><br />Goddard wanted to protect his inventions, but that cost him the credit and honor that he coveted so much during the years he lived.  It was only after his death that his beloved wife, Esther secured his spot in history.<br /><br />Charles Lindbergh and Harry Guggenhiem threw in their consideable support in promoting Goddard's inventions post-humously as well, and that is why he is not just a foot note in history today.<br /><br />Dr Goddard demonstrated impressive technical skill, insight and integrity despite financial contraints and public skeptism.<br /><br />He was forced to deal with failure over and over and over.  Years of his life was spent in pursuit of incorrect thinking, that modern rocketry would go in only one direction.<br /><br />In the end, he proved that he had what it takes to launch a payload into extreme altitudes.<br /><br />He was a pioneer in thinking that man would one day land on the moon - the mere mention of this idea would bring a room to racious laughter - people were incredulous of his brilliance in those days.  His wife believed in him, and this was his one strongest ally in his own little islolated world of discovery.<br /><br />I found it odd and amusing that he lived many years in Roswell, New Mexico.  This was before the Rosewell Alien crash in 1948, but I wonder to this day if there was any connection, and what Goddard's reaction to the legendary alien crash would have been.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to know whether or not Goddard believed in extraterrestials.  This is not discussed in this fine book, but author, David Clary did a superb job in bringing back to life this mysterious scientist.<br /><br />There were bright points of Robert Goddard's life, and there were darker shades also, the man was human - after all.<br /><br />He dared to dream bigger than most scientists of his time.....he is often compared to Hermann Oberth and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky - other physicists that theorized about space travel.<br /><br />But our man, Robert Goddard was the FIRST to actually build rockets and test them and work on them until some degree of continuity was achieved.<br /><br />And for this tireless and thankless effort, Goddard is reviered today as the first ROCKET MAN of the ages.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book greatly - I actually had begun reading another book about a famous astronaught, but when I perused this book, it took command of my undivided attention.<br /><br />There is alot to know about these early men; who risked social stigma to apply what they theorized to actual science.<br /><br />We can credit Goddard with the entire US Space program; he was on the ground floor.<br /><br />Maybe Sputnik could send his estate a belated thank you card, because at the time, the only person actively developing these great flying machines was a lonely bald scientist toiling away in the hot desert in remote sections of New Mexico.<br /><br />Have a read -- this book will lift your imaginations to new heights and I guarantee, you will learn much from this great man.<br /><br />It is a really interesting book and easy to understand.connection, and what Goddard's reaction to the legendary alien crash would have been. <br />It would have been interesting to know whether or not Goddard believed in extraterrestials.

Despite a slow start in the ultra dry chapter one, this book takes off slowly to reveal some top of the glacier secrets that define what is known as the US Secret Service.<br /><br />This book discusses it's biggest loss - Losing Lancer on chapter 3 was such a traumatic event for the Secret Service, as well as the nation and ultimately the world.<br /><br />Have we recovered from the assasination of John F. Kennedy?  I would say that NO - we have NOT.<br /><br />Changes still abound due to this tragic event in Nov 1963.<br /><br />I didn't want to read yet another book on the topic of the JFK assasination, but this book really does address it from a different point of view. YES, many errors were made, and the president was gunned down, but still -- questions remain unanswered...even after all these years...(41 years)<br /><br />Current president protective measures are discussed, including the homeland security that was needed since 9-11-01.<br /><br />The Secret Service is stretched to it's limits these days; protecting important people such as the president is more high risk than ever in history.  The SS in the age of terrorism is discussed in the last chapter.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed Chapter 7 which goes into depth about the actual training of a secret service agent...the types of classess they enroll in and the details about weaponry.<br /><br />Each SS agent is issued a 9-mm Sig Sauer semiautomatic pistol to keep on thier person 24/7/365. They learn to dress a certain way, keep physically fit, psychologically balanced and have trigger reflexes when it comes to guarding the president or another VIP worthy of SS protection.<br /><br />All of this comes at a cost, and no taxpayer will applaud it too much, although, POST 9-11, we cannot offer any acceptable arguments against the Secret Service's existence.<br /><br />Of course, protection of VIPs is the famous indication for this select group of men and women.  But also tracing counterfieting operations is of equal importance ..... ever since 1865, the SS learned how to identify counterfiet money and track it's bogus printers.<br /><br />This book is somewhat dry in places, but when you get into reading it, it proves to be chock full of pertinent information.  If you or somebody you care about ever has the notion that they would like to be a man in black, they should buy this book and read it cover to cover.<br /><br />It's full of credible information and it's interesting and I highly recommend this book for people who are curious about national security and the nutts and bolts of protecting our president from harm.learned how to identify counterfiet money and track it's bogus printers. <br />This book is somewhat dry in places, but when you get into reading it, it proves to be chock full of pertinent information.

He didn't	We waited 50 long years and finally, somebody who values the TRUTH has spoken out and tells it the way it was in Roswell, New Mexico, on the night of July 4th, 1947 --- IT CAME OUT OF THE SKY!  Possibly downed by the super-high voltage lightning storms of NM, this alien mother ship crashed and changed our quality of living when humans scavenged thier technology by reverse engineering of it's technology into our modern high tech gadgets.<br /><br />Lieutenant colonel Philip J. Corso, (R) a distinguished member of Pres Eisenhowe'rs National Security Council and former head of the Foreign Technology Desk at the US Army's Research & Development Deptpartment, has come forward to tell the world what really happened in Roswell so many moons ago.<br /><br />He was a hard -working soldier, who had a high code of honor and valor.  He is a believer in the truth, and through the Freedom of INformation Act, he decided to publish his spin on the story.<br /><br />It is a startling story, but told in a way that smacks of the truth.  The Gov stashed the truth from an inquiring public, because they didn't want the nation to spin in fright about non-friendly aliens who had hositle intentions against us.<br /><br />For example, cow mutilations, human abductions with subsequent probing type experimentation, UFO Power beams that knocked out power and endangered human space flight in the 60's.<br /><br />All this sounds too fantastic to be true, but the author tells it like it was just another day on the job.<br /><br />One question he does not answer, however, is WHY DID THE ALIENS SUDDENLY GO AWAY?  Why are we dismantling our massive nuclear arsenal today if we still feel a threat from the little green people?  Actually, Col. Corso does not feel these alien beings are actual living organisms, but rather, they are a genetically altered humanoid automatron; which are the result of cloning of humans from our very own Earth! They are some freakish hybred being that is comprised of cloned human parts, and a stem cell here and tucked there. It's not really fully explained what he thinks the dead aliens are...they were a life form however, and when they crash-landed in Roswell, they 'died.'  But they had no way to eat or obtain sustenance, or eliminate bodily wastes.  The spaceship itself had no engine, no navigation system, no fuel, no control system and no propulsion that was obvious to any scientist who studied it.  It remains one of the biggest technological mysteries --- even today.  The technology of the alien spacecraft is still very advanced compared to all the inventions we gleaned from the crash vehicle.  It is housed in a secret bedroom at Norton Airforce Base in California, but you and I will never get to peek at it!<br /><br />So, it gathers dust.<br /><br />The author claims that Astronaut Neil Armstrong had reported seein an alien base on the moon during the Apollo 11 flyover and landing....of course, NASA won't admit to it because it's being treated as a matter of national security.  No wonder Armstrong has never published his book on his lunar landing....or maybe it's (secretly) written already and is waiting on a shelf at his home and upon his death, it will be released to the world - the real facts of what he witnessed on the moon.<br /><br />That's what military folks do...the live, they keep horrid secrets and then they see the end of their lives around the corners and they publish their life story.<br /><br />Nobody can persecute a dead man, after all...<br /><br />Other pilots and astronauts also made similar claims of seeing UFOs in their trainging or military flights, but no one responded to their claims.<br /><br />THe sad reality is that anyone making such outlandish claims is immediately labled a nutcase - or they are accused of having a mental breakdown.  We are we so eager to discount reality?  I think it's far more dangerous to deny what thousands of UFO witnesses have sworn testimony to.  Aliens are out there.<br /><br />The last portion of this book deals with two famous geniouses, THomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, who created many world shaking inventions such as electricity and televsion and radio.<br /><br />Corso also reveals how he seeded modern industries with the basis of revolutionary inventions gleaned from the Roswell crash that eventually led to discoveries like<br /><br />integrated circuit chips<br /><br />fiber optics<br /><br />lasers<br /><br />super tenacity fibers<br /><br />and eventually computers.<br /><br />One day we will have to come to terms with the absolute truth about aliens and our planet, and the planet they hail from.  It may be a time of extreme worry and fear.  But we have reached milestones with inventions and we can continue to conquer any threat that comes to our attentions.  Finally, we can join together as one world and defend our right to live free.<br /><br />Thank you, Colonel Corso, for writing a risky book that some call a fraud but most dare to believe.<br /><br />There is no reason whatsoever for this man to embellish, there is nothing to gain by telling fairy tales.<br /><br />SO - based on this&#62; &#62; &#62;  choose to believe.omas Edison and Nikola Tesla, who created many world shaking inventions such as electricity and televsion and radio.   <br />Corso also reveals how he seeded modern industries with the basis of revolutionary inventions gleaned from the Roswell crash that eventually led to discoveries like <br />integrated circuit chips <br />fiber optics <br />lasers <br />super tenacity fibers  <br />and eventually computers. <br />One day we will have to come to terms with the absolute truth about aliens and our planet, and the planet they hail from.

Patricia Cornwall started the book questioning herself if this forensic investigation was worthy of her time and sweat.<br />She was horrified yet facinated by the crimes of Jack the Ripper, and to be honest, I never knew the depth of his sickness and hatred against women.  But women weren't his only victims, he killed young boys as well.<br />Cornwall had a theory that Walter Richard Sickert was the one and only Jack the Ripper...by day, he was Dr. Jekyll and by darkness, he became the hideous Mr. Hide.  Or was it the other way around?<br />In either case, this book is a facinating glimpse into what life was like in London in the mid to late 1800's.<br />She describes the country and paints a dark and dirty picture of it.  Her descriptions are credible accounts of how life in polluted London must have been.  The \\"Unfortunates,\\" are the women who were forced to live a life of the oldest profession.  WOmen in those days had no rights at all, and could not own property.  It was a death sentence to ever become divorced in Victorian society.<br />Jack the Ripper preyed on these unfortunates, and his crimes were ghastly.  Cornwall provides her theory that Walter Richard Sickert was the serial killer known as JTR, but since his remains were cremated, we will never know this as fact.<br />Give the woman a break...all she has to go on is the saliva which was scraped from underneath an old postage stamp.<br />Her theory is a sound one, the artist Walter R Sickert drew some unsettling and unsavory canvases.  He was a sicko alright.<br />Now, during the late 1880's, a man known as the Elephant Man lived in the same neighborhood where these henious crimes were being committed.  Due to his otherworldy appearance and deformity, there were those who wrongly accused the EM about the crimes.  He was innocent, he was locked up in hospital not to protect the neighborhood from him but rather, to protect him from the natives.  People could be so cruel.<br />Here's the irony -- the Elephant Man was horribly deformed all over his body due to some rare cellular pathology, but his manly parts were perfect.<br />He could experience love and lust, but no woman could stomach looking at him or smelling him.<br />He was truly a monster on the outside, but inside, he was a kind, intelligent person who experienced love.<br />Compare him to Walter Sickert, the handsome artist who liked to draw fiendish portraits of mutilated women.<br />He was handsome on the outside, all except for his genitalia.<br />Cornwall explains in great detail the gruesome deformities that made it impossible for Sickert to consummate his love for women.  That deformity drove him to extreme rage against women.<br />Thus, inside, Sickert was a more terrible monster than the Elephant Man, because he lusted to kill.<br />He lusted for blood of innocent victims.  He was a killing type of monster who had a love for darkness and hideous thoughts.<br />Cornwall was able to provide motive behind the Ripper's killing.<br />There you have it....Cornwall painstakingly took many months to research this man of misery.<br />She read countless letters of his, becuase Jack the Ripper loved to write and pen things down and he mailed alot of letters to Scotland Yard...mostly just to taunt them.<br />All the brightest cops just couldn't put two and two together.<br />Unfortunately for those women who were slashed by the Ripper, they could not be put together again ever again.<br />It's a good book but got rather longish in the end.<br />Still - a valiant effort written by a brilliant forensic scientist, Ms Patricia Cornwall.over his body due to some rare cellular pathology, but his manly parts were perfect.

WHY he remains silent is a mystery - the author attributes his silence to a severe case of modesty, but I ain't buying that version of the story.<br /><br />WHY does Armstrong remain silent on what is considered man's hugest technical achievment in history?<br /><br />THe psychology on that alone could fill 800 pages.<br /><br />I still rate \\"One Giant Leap\\" 5 stars because it's about a man who won't talk.<br /><br />Read this book and pay attention to what is said between the lines.<br /><br />He won't talk about it...the author resorts to interrogating everybody in Armstrong's universe, not him nor his ex-wife.<br /><br />YES - Armstrong did remarry --- but what does it all mean?<br /><br />The woman who stood by his side during those frantic space shot years will forever be his life mate and soul mate.<br /><br />GOSH - the stories she must have heard.<br /><br />Or maybe Armstrong clammed up too long about it with her, which would explain the divorce proceedings.<br /><br />My opinion is that I am happy to read ANYTHING about this important man and his gigantic leap into the scientific discovery of the moon, life supporting necessities of deep space, and interpersonal relationships that he had with his 2 other space buddies and his immediate family.<br /><br />ALl those people could tell us more about this fantastic journey.<br /><br />THe cover photo is one that Armstrong took of his buddy, BUZZ ALDRIN, (The second man on the moon - he HATES when people point that out.)<br /><br />Buzz was too PO'd about being number 2, so he never did decide to be nice and snap a pix of Neil for posterity.<br /><br />So - Aldrin is the snapshot space man on the cover of this interesting book....every picture tells a story.<br /><br />Think of how mad you had to be if you REFUSED to take somebody's picture, and NASA was on your can to DO it now, but you refused over and over.<br /><br />That must have frustrated Ground Control immensely.<br /><br />Again - the psychology of inter space travel is something that has not really been much elaborated on.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everybody, especially Mr. Neil Armstrong.<br /><br />He'd surely want to set some records straight after reading this book, and I agree with him.<br /><br />It's HIGH TIME that the people of the world read his personal account of what happened up there on the Moon.<br /><br />After all, we prayed for him and held our collective breaths with each step he took up there, in that gravity-less environment that could have taken him to an early and unexpected grave had one little problem occured.<br /><br />Prayers helped his mission to be 1,000% successful....and it's been 35 years since this happened.<br /><br />Time is running out on old Neil --- I hope he doesn't go to his grave with all his wonderous tails of awesome space experience.<br /><br />Now is the time to share this marvelous achievement.<br /><br />The world would like to hear from the man himself, in his own thoughts and words.<br /><br />It's too important an achievement for Armstrong to keep for himself totally.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder if things would be different in the respects of Buzz Aldrin being number one on the Moon.<br /><br />He'd spill his gutts all over the place, I have a hunch.<br /><br />Or maybe he'd off made an error and never landed at all.<br /><br />One never can test fate.<br /><br />It was Armstrong as our Number One Space Man in 1969 -  I sure would LOVE to hear his words on this story.<br /><br />For now, this book will suffice.if things would be different in the respects of Buzz Aldrin being number one on the Moon. <br />He'd spill his gutts all over the place, I have a hunch. <br />Or maybe he'd off made an error and never landed at all. <br />One never can test fate. <br />It was Armstrong as our Number One Space Man in 1969 -  I sure would LOVE to hear his words on this story. <br />For now, this book will suffice.	2004-08-19

The simple equation having only 5 symbols is deep in meaning. It took the genious of Einstein to put the equation together way back in 1905 - - - What E found was: Energy equals mass when you accelerate mass to the speed of light squared.  That's 670,000,000 mph times itself.<br />C stands for 'celeritis' in latin and it means, 'swiftness.' C squared is 448,900,000,000,000,000 mph!<br />No speedometer exists on Earth that can travel that fast! WOW!<br />Einstein knew that energy could naturally transform itself into mass under specific and unique condtions.<br />The equation was published in 1905 and essentially remained dormant and untested until the war.<br />Then it became a horrifying reality that Einstein himself wished he never uncovered all those years ago.<br />Other scientists converged their great minds together in a think tank called the Manhatten Projet, and the world changed for the worse --- upon their nuclear discoveries.<br />Did Fat Boy really need to do what he did?<br />NEVER!  THe controversy broils to this day.<br />It is so strange to contemplate that in the pool of the most intelligent men on Earth, not a one of them was smart enough to forsee the evil that they created.<br />Like the saying goes, &quot;You can lead a man to wisdom, but you can't make him think.&quot;<br />None of them thought about what this nuclear power could do when left in terrorist grips.<br />This book tells the story behind the famous little equation.<br />Einstein did play a part in developing nuclear arsonel, even though he later denied he encouraged it.<br />Please see his letter to President FDR on pages 117 - 18.<br />The reader is left to draw thier own conclusions on that.<br />Regardless of the controversy, I read this book and must give it my highest recommendations to all who ever wondered what this equation means.  It's deep but not complex.<br />It's complex but not inaccessable by average minds.<br />What's really chilling is reading what is not said in between the lines of this book.<br />Could we have avoided the discovery of the Atomic bomb?<br />Imagine our world without it.....and to think, the Germans weren't all that close to uncovering the secret behind the destruction.<br />This is a good book about E = mc 2.<br />Read it and learn that all discoveries have a dark side.ould we have avoided the discovery of the Atomic bomb?<BR>Imagine our world without it.....and to think, the Germans weren't all that close to uncovering the secret behind the destruction.<BR>This is a good book about E = mc 2.<BR>Read it and learn that all discoveries have a dark side.	2004-06-18

She is a simple country gal who grew up in a close knit American town, but like so many small towns in West Virginia, this means there are not too many options facing it's high school graduates.<br />Precious few jobs exist and that is why small country hollers in the middle of nowhere, USA recruit the highest per capita ratio of young people willing to become soldiers.<br />The military is the only exciting future for many teens.<br />Jessi was one such person - tough as nails and pretty as a tiny doll.  She proved herself to be an American hero in an Iraqi battlefield.<br />Many people don't know this, but Jessica Lynch was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Prisoner of War Medal.<br />She deserves each and every distinguished metal, and she has the internal &amp; external scars to prove her mettle.<br />Some rude people are skeptical of her sacrifices, but as they sit on thier ever-expanding duffs critising everybody, Jessi is struggling to rehabilitate her legs and bladder and bowels.<br />Her wounds are far from being healed even today.<br />What horrors her dreams are made of nightly from being a prisoner of war I can only shiver and wonder about.<br />She gave all that she could for this war and served the US Army to her utmost abilities.<br />It is difficult to know that there are persons who wish to defame Jessica Lynch - people like that belong in hell.<br />YES, she is a super-star, a woman warrior and famous person who recieved many special gifts as well as discretionary bonuses, but Jessica herself is adamant that she would give &quot;Four hundred billion dollars&quot; for none of it to have ever occured, if she could somehow board a time machine and take back the combat death of her best roomy friend, Private First Class Lori Piestwa.<br />Jessica would do anything to talk her friend, PFC Lori Piestewa, out of going into Iraq, because her friend had papers discussing a shoulder injury which would have enabled her to stay in the safe zone.<br />Private Piestwa was a Hopi Indian and was the first Hopi to die in the line of fire in the history of this nation.<br />She leaves behind two young children, under the tender age of 5.  I plowed through this book, reading about Jessica's life, but when I hit page 167 --- tears exploded in my eyes --- on this page is the picture of the father of Lori Piestewa, as a poem written for his daughter was being read at the Women in Military Service Memorial at Arlington National Cemetary.<br />Oh ... the anguish, the hoplessness, the sorrowful look on the old man's face...it crushed my hearts into bits and pieces and his grief came rushing into my own heart.<br />Jessica tells her story and does not leave out those heros who were tragically left behind; those who can never go home again.<br />The only consolation is that the body of young Private First Class Lori Piestewa was found and taken back to her family.<br />Her remains are now buried close to her kin, not buried in an unmarked place in the sandy dunes of Iraq.<br />This story moved me more than any of the other books that I have reviewed here.  It's a story that rings of truth, of youth and consequences of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />I sincerely wish that Jessica Lynch marries her sweetheart, Sgt. Rueben Contreras, and that they can have a happy life together.<br />I sincerely wish the people of Palestine, West Virginia, God's blessings and good grace; they truly love Jessica Lynch.<br />In spite of terrible tragedies, such as death, it is important to remember that life goes on...it simply has to go on.<br />After reading this book, (it only took 2 1/2 hours to read it from cover to cover.) I prayed for the soldiers in Iraq -- and those who will not make it home outside of the body bag. I pray for them and their families and for this great nation of ours who puts a high value on freedom and democracy for all humankind.<br />This story will move you like none other.<br />It makes me feel so proud to be an American, and to have those ideals of family, God and democracy deep in my heart.<br />God Bless the USA!.<BR>This story will move you like none other.<BR>It makes me feel so proud to be an American, and to have those ideals of family, God and democracy deep in my heart.<BR>God Bless the USA!	2004-06-01

He was not a doctor, nor did he understand exactly what he was doing to the hapless patient...<br />The patient lying quietly on the slab was dreading an exquisitely painful operation; a tumor was to be removed from his neck. He was to be the first to recieve a completely painfree operation.<br />The surgical theater was packed with surgeons and medical students up to the rafters....<br />Would this prove a huge scientific discovery or another humbug?<br />It was a huge success and the medical world plus humankind (and animals) would never have to suffer painful surgical intervention again!<br />Horace Wells and Charles Jackson also laid claim to the actual discovery of Nitrous Oxide, as explained on page 51.<br />The three men had equal vestitures of discovery of the analgesic properties of Nitrous, Ether, Choroform and other more modern anesthetics.<br />Unfortunately for them, their curosity of these inhalable substances led to their addictions to it for the rest of their natural lives.<br />Greed and the need to be recognized for this invention also consumed the minds of these young scientists.<br />They all died without any recompense for their amazing discovery,<br />which is the mother of all rip-offs if you asked me.<br />Their lives were completely enslaved to the powers of these vapors and the legalities tied to the discovery.<br />I bought this amazing little book because I am engaged in a gigantic debate with an anesthesiologist.<br />She doesn't think my psychiatric technician students should be allowed to witness certain surgeries in the OR that she works in. I am seeking all powerful stories and arguments to bolster my position...and this is my position...<br />any all all persons who are intelligent and brave enough to WANT to witness a surgery SHOULD be allowed to witness one.<br />It's a valuable learning experience that should be shared by as many willing parties in controlled conditions.<br />She is too elitist, because she values only the up and coming MDs.  The hospital is not a residency medical center.<br />It's a nice community hospital with some good learning going on...why not share the knowledge and allow science to flow from the OR onto new students who would value this experience?<br />I learned alot about anesthesiology by reading this moderatly thin volume...it's a bargain, too.<br />For 97 cents, I expanded my mind, built an arsenal of great arguments pro-surgical theatrics and can challenge the minds of even the most preMadonna-ist of anesthesiologists!<br />Tell me --- Now, you go girl!<br />And just watch me....Off I go!LD be allowed to witness one.<BR>It's a valuable learning experience that should be shared by as many willing parties in controlled conditions.<BR>She is too elitist, because she values only the up and coming MDs.

Chris Kraft is one of those brilliant rarities that can lead and design complex and difficult projects and has complete faith that the answer is just around the next corner.<br />He was the FLIGHT director of all three distinguished space programs beginning with Mercury and ending with Apollo.<br />Gemini was stuck in the middle and without Gemini, Apollo would never have landed on the moon.<br />It's so odd that many people STILL refuse to accept the facts that the USA DID in fact land on the moon on that fateful day, July 20th, 1969.<br />YES - 44 years ago Apollo 11 did so on the EAGLE at exactly 3:17:39.9PM CST in the United States of America.<br />Neil Armstrong's voice was clear over the radio, a quarter million miles away,<br />\\"Houston, Tranquility Base here.  The Eagle has landed.\\"<br />Armstrong was much admired in NASA for having a cool head under intense pressure and he was unanimously voted to be the first man to step foot on the moon.<br />At the time, it was unknown what the surface of the moon was made of...some scientists feared the top layer of the moon dust was one mile of soft sand that would collapse under any weight and swallow up the landing ship upon it's landing.<br />Thankfully, this did not occur, nor were there any life-threatning germs found on the lunar surface.<br />\\"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\"<br />Those words forever changed our world.  Along with the lunar landing came many inventions that blessed our quality of life with many newfangled inventions like the super speedy computers and telemetry that could monitor heart rhythms of people.<br />Everyone got their due in this tell-all book and what a page-turner it proved to be.  Kraft is a brilliant man who can tell it like it is and he sure lead an exciting and intellectual life.<br />It's sad that his family got the short end of the stick, but the nation recieved his best and most intensive labor.<br />Without Kraft, I seriously doubt that the US would have made the moon in 1969...I really do.<br />Read this book and understand the whole story....all the twists and turns and convolutions of the bueracracy.<br />It's interesting and I need to mention that initially, Kraft had a low interpersonal assesment of the genious scientist, Wernher von Braun.  He disliked the fact that von Braun bombed Europe with his evil VH bombs --- he hated the fact that Hitler bossed von Braun around the way he did.  But then later, he had to understand that a knife was held at von Bruan's throat and he HAD to do those evil things.....or Hitler would of had him executed or shot or whatnot.....Kraft later awarded von Bruan  with his highest admiration because without von Braun, there'd very likely be no Saturn V moon rocket.  It's statistics must NEVER be forgotten, insists Kraft, and here I will discuss it with you.<br />The Saturn V had 3 stages, the first was 33 feet in diameter.<br />It had 5 monster rocket engines and each one could produce 1.5 MILLION pounds of thrust!  (That's 7.5 million pounds on this stage alone....)<br />Now add stage 2 :  it was 30 feet in diameter and had 5 smaller engines that punched up 1 million pounds of thrust.<br />(uh let's see --- 5 more million pounds added to #1.)<br />Then the third stage was 22 feet across with no specified thrust given, but it was impressive!!!<br />Add the equation up and add some more millions to it and uh --- well -- you get the idea! That mutha kicked!!!<br />All this power was required to break free of Earth's gravitational field and launch Apollo into Earth orbit.<br />WOW! What a ride it must have been!<br />All this happened so long ago and before long, Americans took space travel for granted.<br />According to Kraft, we could have landed on MARS in the 1990's had we stuck to our high ideals and kept the NASA space exploration programs going at full tilt.<br />But politics and Viet Nam came into the picture and that was the piece of pie NASA needed to perform these unrealizeddreams.<br />They went as far as Apollo 17 - that was as far as the budget and national interest allowed for them.<br />Kind of a shame to stop dreaming big....but I know other programs need our aid too.<br />Some people say we don't need space and we don't need to explore while world hunger is still a reality here along with homelessness and child abuse.<br />Maybe we should forgo it and take care of the more fundamental problems facing humanity here on Earth.<br />But after reading this quality book, it encourages one's intellect to reach for the stars and never stop thirsting for the truth about our universe and the many associated discoveries that will come with other great adventures up there in the mysterious cosmos.<br />I bought this book for a mere $3.98 and I wish I could share it with every person who is reading here at AMAZON dot com.<br />It's a wonderful book that you should endeaver -- it will bring you much discovery and knowledge.<br />Thank you Chris Kraft for living an exemplary life and sharing your brain power with all those programs that improved the world.<br />The story is worth reading from all who shared in it and have a point of view.t was as far as the budget and national interest allowed for them.<BR>Kind of a shame to stop dreaming big....but I know other programs need our aid too.<BR>Some people say we don't need space and we don't need to explore while world hunger is still a reality here along with homelessness and child abuse.<BR>Maybe we should forgo it and take care of the more fundamental problems facing humanity here on Earth.<BR>But after reading this quality book, it encourages one's intellect to reach for the stars and never stop thirsting for the truth about our universe and the many associated discoveries that will come with other great adventures up there in the mysterious cosmos.<BR>I bought this book for a mere $3.98 and I wish I could share it with every person who is reading here at AMAZON dot com.<BR>It's a wonderful book that you should endeaver -- it will bring you much discovery and knowledge.<BR>Thank you Chris Kraft for living an exemplary life and sharing your brain power with all those programs that improved the world.<br />The story is worth reading from all who shared in it and have a point of view.	2004-04-27

It's about a man who lived a rough life, and he felt unimportant for practically his whole existence.<br />The only brightness in his life was the love of his life; who he managed to make his wife.  She is one of the FIVE persons he meets up with in Heaven when it is his time to go.<br />The other FOUR persons are really circumstances that the man had encountered while living his life on Earth.<br />They are really metaphors and I have to devote some time to thinking about the meaning behind them.<br />He didn't really know them like friends while he was alive, but he impacted their lives in tremendous ways.<br />Or their lives impacted his life with tremendous influence.<br />The objective of the author, Mitch Albom, is to remind all of us that we are important to many others in this world and we should never, never underestimate this truth.<br />If you are a mother or a father--- this book is influential.<br />If you are a brother or a sister -- this book is important.<br />If you are a child of somebody, this book will help you.<br />If you leave your house for any job on this planet, remember your role and take it seriously.<br />Your role that you play does affect many, many people.<br />It is up to YOU to decide the caliber of your own life's work.<br />The story is about a man named Eddie,<br />but really it's a story that's all about us...the reader.<br />BIRTHDAYS are also treated with respect and importance.  I have always valued birthdays and I think they are extremely important in the ongoing validation of people that we know and love.<br />Never foget a birthday -- at least give the person having a birthday some acknowledgment of their special day.<br />After all --- the world changes every time there is a birthday  (for better or worse.)<br />It's brilliantly thought out,<br />the words are simple, well chosen and paint a lovely picture.<br />I think that the FIVE people I meet in Heaven will be mostly folks that I knew on Earth, but then again, I can be like Eddie and learn about things in the background of my life that I never considered.<br />One thing this book encourages is<br />TO DO YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST at whatever role you play in this world.<br />Be a good parent.

This book is written by the man who revolutionized the scientific study of death and what happens to our bodies when our spirit leaves and the blowflies move in.<br />Before reading this fine book, I never considered that the fly I shooed off my shoulder or off my food, may have been spawned inside of a dead corpse! (GAG!)  Hoo-ballooo-ballooo!...that just gives me the willies.!  My maw tole me flies were dirty creatures, but she never did tell me that they spawn on dead flesh!  How totally disgusting!  But, these are the facts according to one who knows; Dr. Bass set up this forensic research lab and studied the process of death - how a body can go from warm dead to cold, rigor mortis and rot all the way down to the skeletal level.<br />Evidently, the rotting down to the bone level is quicker when the temperature is warma and there is alot of moisture in the atomosphere.  But if a corpse is inside a body of water, it tends to preserve itself a bit longer...nobody knew this fact until our kind Dr. Bass conducted actual experiementation on the subject.  So now we know.....<br />He needed to do this in order to pinpoint the time of death that a human being died.  This is extremely applicable to those unfortunate souls who were victims of violent crimes.<br />One day you read in the newspaper that person was found dead in their home; bloated, smelly and laying in a pool of black oil.<br />The first question from the coroner and the family is, \\"How long have they been dead?\\"  Nobody could estimate this with any accuracy until Dr. Bass's studies began in the Anthropology Research Facility in Tennesse....Patricia Cornwall dubbed it, \\"The Body Farm,\\" and made it famous around the globe.<br />I'd sure like to visit the place someday, but only while I am still alive!<br />Nobody had ever done this research prior to Dr. Bass, because, quite frankly, it's revolting and disgusting work.<br />Thank God that Dr. Bass can look beyond the gore, and get to the truth: (but how he can tolerate the horrible smell is beyond me!  UGH! GROSS!)<br />The stench would knock one off their feet!<br />Dr. Bass explains how he came into the field of studying death and decay, and he has dedicated not only this book, but his entire professional career to all victims of murder, their family who mourns them, and to all who seek justice.<br />That is pretty amazing stuff; alot of the studies have to do with maggots and their lifespan.  I have to say that I admire the man for going where no other man dare goeth.  All the discoveries of dead bodies and the process of death is clearly explained, and it's only a tad gross. As readers, we aren't subjected to sniffing the foulness of the air when a corpse is being studied, like Dr. Bass's students had to do.  Nor are there nasty photos that will cause one to upchuck one's breakfast; the stories are told well and the good doctor keeps it all under control, so the reader will not stumble upon some detail that could possibly be traumatic.  I recommend this book to anyone who has an avid interest in medicine and forensics. It is also a good book for people who love flies and want to learn more about maggots.  I also think it comes in handy when deciding what to do with your remains once you die.  I am very much in the air after reading this book...I  am still torn between being cremated versus being buried inside of a casket.  Both methods have their draw-backs but one thing is for certain...I am not donating my body for any scientific studies at the Body Farm in Tennesse! No siree!orrible smell is beyond me!  UGH!

Admit it, you've wondered how great artists like Vincent Van Gogh came up with all his brightly colored paintings, with brush strokes as thick as tiles.  &quot;Cafe Terrace at Night&quot; is one such work of superb inspiration. Or maybe you are driving in your car, feeling anxious about a confrontation at home or at work that will occur minutes ahead, and a Led Zepplin song comes on the radio - you crank it up and suddenly --- you are no longer feeling fragile -- the music of the Zep affects your brain state in a way that makes you feel a lion!<br />Your mood has been transformed by the hard driving rock music and off you go...no longer the sheep, but the lion king!<br />I have often contemplated what drives artists to create the beautiful works that they do....<br />Are there really such things as Muses that wander around the Earth, selectively choosing one person to create a great Rock Ballad while picking someone else to compose a classic painting?<br />Do the Muses care who is the ballerina as opposed to who works in a coal mine all day long?  God must have a hand in distributing the 'gift' does He not?<br />What drives a person to become artistic?<br />What are the forces behind the artists of our times?<br />This wonderful book attempts to explain where the drive to write arises, and it is within our own 3 pound brains.<br />Dr. Alice Flaherty pinpoints the location of inspiration to be somewhere in the Limbic System -- between the hypothalmus and temporal lobes.  Somewhere that we deeply experience pleasure and displeasure.<br />Why study creative forces?<br />Some artists feel we should leave it alone; that looking to closely could possibly render it extinct.<br />But the author and I have this agreement - &quot;Creativity is too important a phenomenon that we cannot afford not to study it.&quot;<br />The author readily discloses her mental health history, with tragedies revealed that lend her theories much credence.<br />She has her internal scars that may initially be invisible to you and I, but after reading this brilliant book, we conclude that she still does require further intensive care and attention.<br />No, she is not psychotic, but is in a suspended state of grieving, and this book may have helped her heal a great deal.<br />She admits that her altered (depresssed) psychic state plunged  her  into the state of 'hypergraphia' or the need to write down thoughts in order to communicate an important idea and perhaps these ideas may change our world in positive ways.<br />She cites many poets, behaviorists and scientists along the way, and sometimes the intellectualism gets rather deep.  It's dry in some pasages, but be patient and stick it out.  Because when the author comes up for air, and regains her stride,  we are rewarded for sticking through the reading with passages from poems that are jewels.<br />Take Donald Justice's poem, &quot;The Telephone Number of the Muse.&quot;<br />It's just breathtaking....<br />&quot;I call her up sometimes, long distance now.<br />And she still knows my voice, but I can hear,<br />Behind the music of her phonograph,<br />The laughter of the young men with their keys.<br />I have the number written down somewhere....&quot;<br />This is a captivating book - read it and discover why you read and why you  ought to read this interesting book.<br />I think I know who the Muse is....it's metaphoric for our inner child.

Dr. Michael West is a brilliant man in search of high tech ways to cure catastrophic diseases & pathologies - such as type I Diabetes, Quadriplegia, cancer and heart damage from heart attacks.  All noble quests to benefit mankind. The only problem with this is that along with the potential to help mankind with regenerative medicine concepts, therein lies another darker potential.  The corruptability of such an endeaver, and yes, there are always those equally brilliant scientists out there who are willing to tweak the bad that generates from the good.<br />West goes into vague detail explaining what stem cells are, and what the science can acheive in medicine, and cloning. I wish he went into further depth giving examples and photos of what he witnessed under the microscope.  If he would have included some slides, I would have given the book a 5 star rating instead of the 4.  It is a good book that gives readers a taste of this controversial topic. He further explains how Dolly the sheep came to be in this world, and yes, the sheep was named after Dolly Parton, the country singer, because the sheep was cloned out of a cell from  the breast tissue of another sheep.<br />All this research into the mortal cell costs millions, perhaps billions of dollars, $$$, but in the end, the goal is not to prolong life forever.  It's really to maintain the quality of life for all, especially the aged.  Dr. West is very compassionate towards the elderly in our world, and it's good to see that somebody is passionate about curing the ails that often accompany old age.<br />One question that I have for Dr. West is what should the average life expectancy be for people? 100?  110?<br />Curing hearing and sight loss, kidney failure, liver failure are all good things that could come from recombinant DNA therapy.<br />But the dark side could promote supernatural human beings; turning engineered cells into engineered people. These 'superpeople' can potentially outthink, outperform and ultimately - wipe out the current natural human race that we have spent millions of years evolving into.  If these cloned people reproduced with regular human beings, something called germ-line genetic modification, something terribly wrong could happen.  This is one of the kind Doctor's admitted fears.<br />Our standard of living would become too high to sustain or even achieve.  It would create many insurmountable problems the world has never known.<br />Tinkering with the atom in the Manhatten Project ultimately brought us terrorism as we know it today.  Could those brilliant scientists not see the disaster behind the discovery?<br />Now our modern scientists are tinkering with the human genome project.  It is mapped out and published.  Scientists such as Dr. West wish to exploit this important and exciting discovery to help mankind, but we must be wary of the ever present dark side of all good creations.<br />Are we ready to make this scientific leap?<br />Read the book and ponder the answer...I have no answers at this point---the book contains arguments both ways, but leans towards the pro and dismisses the con pretty blantantly.<br />Nonetheless, it is a very interesting read, and contains somewhat technical ideas in it, which only encourages me to further research the topic of theraputic cloning and stem cell research.ipe out the current natural human race that we have spent millions of years evolving into.

Blame it on genetics: the DRD4 7 R gene to be exact!	Blame it on the mommy, but somehow those rambunctious Kennedy kids inherited a recessive gene that is responsible for taking big risks.  Scientists isolated and identified the gene found in most of the dead Kennedy's....the DRD4 7 R gene.  That is the concept that this book is based on.<br />Supposedly, people who have this trait inherit the urge to perform high risk operations like driving while drunk,<br />piloting expensive aircraft with novice level skills, and<br />skiing into tree trunks while playing foozball in the snow.<br />Ugh....I do feel sorry for those rich Kennedy's....all the money and fame in the world cannot buy them longevity.<br />But their lives are superbly filled with every imaginable adventure,  and they are wealthy folks.<br />The author, Edward Klein offers up some gossip that I have not read before. Or maybe I did read it before somewhere, but I just forgot about it.<br />He takes an exhaustive look from the late 1850's on how the bad luck of the Kennedy clan first started.<br />On page 24, the sorrowful journey of 'the curse' begins.<br />In the forty years that have passed since the public assasination of JFK in Dallas, the author notes that every 2 years ---somebody in the Kennedy family (or somebody closely associated with the Kennedy's) has a terrible accident.<br />Usually they die.<br />This list tallied 23 such incidents since that dark and greivace November 22nd of 1963, when the shots from the Texas School Book Depository... forever changed the course of mankind.

I've read too many books to believe that lie...when will the truth be told?<br />The book rattles and prattles on about alleged affairs that JFK had with various women.

Ooh, I've read lots about the world's most beloved princess, Princess Diana, but this book tells some of the most intimate secrets shared by the Princess and her butler, Paul Burrell.  Actually, the butler was much MORE than a mere servant.  He was her rock and yet he had no life of his own.  He was addicted to her beauty and grace, and became in many ways a loving husband to Di, when her real husband turned out to be a jerk.  He was also a loving brother, when her real brother let her down numerous times.  He was her nurse, her shrink, her caretaker; all while being able to brew a mean pot of coffee!<br />There are many secrets left untold; this is repeated throughout the book, and Princess Di had many suitors that remain secret.<br />She lived a life full of all the material things that any woman could dream of---yet, she was destitute for love and belonging.  Di was very generous with the ordinary folks who toiled day in and day out for her... she knew how to write lovely thank you notes and was a prolific writer.<br />She also could be cruel to people, Paul admits --- and gives specifics, but her cruelty was nothing in comparison to the rest of the Royal Family.<br />I am still wondering why Prince Charles cast her out like yesterdays newspaper, and took up lustful residence inside the walls of Camilla Parker-Bowles love nest?<br />Di's walls have to be lovelier than Camilla's old things!<br />There is no story behind his obsession with that ugly woman, and I hope they never marry.<br />Princess Diana was spiritually and emotionally lost after her divorce became absolute from Prince Chaz, but then a miracle intervened.<br />She was able to meet a few times with Mother Theresa, and Diana was convinced at that time that MT was a Saint.<br />MT inspired Diana to do all the good that she could in this harsh and unfeeling world, and she did set out to accomplish humanitarian goals.  The world felt her compassion, strength, and love...and we will never forget her kindness.<br />I still cannot fully believe that this wonderful woman is gone from us....the accident in the Paris Tunnel when the chauffer driven Mercedes crahed into the thirteenth pillar seems like a set-up for murder.  It's been 5 years since her passing, and people from all walks of life still mourn the loss of Princess Diana.  THe most shocking revelation is the premonition that the princess had of her own death scarcely a year prior to the accident - on page 326 - Diana spoke of mysterious forces that were planning an, \\"accident in her car, brake failure and serious head trauma...clearing the path for Charles to remarry.\\"<br />That took great courage to publish....I hope an investigation is done by American investigators....not the Brits who seem to have played some part in it.<br />The clincher of the book is contained in the back pages....how the Spencer family attacked Mr Burrell and accused him of stealing personal items from both Diana and Prince William, which were absolute lies and shenanigans on their part.<br />This poor man was driven to insanity because of their persecution of him, and he came very close to commiting suicide one night.  A caring soul found him and his life was saved.<br />He was ultimately 'forgiven' by the Queen, but I don't think he got any of the gifts that Princess Diana bestowed upon him during her lifetime.  All those 315 items (gifts) are still in the custody of the M15, or Scotland Yard, or perhaps the Corgis have possession of them and are chewing them all to bits.<br />Diana gifted him with many nice items and now he's lost them all, including some sensitive tapes involving her love life and this and that and such.<br />It's a tragic story in the tragic life of Princess Diana, and I am left to wonder how this is even remotely acceptable to Prince Charles, and the Queen herself.<br />Paul Burrell gave 1000% of himself to the service of those bugger Royals and they just gave him grief.<br />If there was ever a book that tells what the Royal Family is really like down deep inside thier evil, selfish and blackened hearts, oooh -- this one tells the tale and spins it like no other book on the topic of the Royal Family.<br />I really detest the concept of a \\"Royal\\" blood line, with even deeper contempt than ever since I finished reading this fine book.  It required the strenth of steel to write and I am very happy that Butler Paul Burrell had the fortitude and the sheer guts to make the effor to preserve the truth about life in the Kensington Palace with Princess Diana.  She was more important to him than his own wife and sons, but they were good with this truth.  They understood because they loved her too.<br />Read this book --- it's mesmerizing --- it's spellbinding...I promise you there are things in there that you have not contemplated or heard before....the real story begins on page 287, which happens to be Chapter 13.<br />Follow it to the bitter end on page 406 ---Thank you, Mr. Paul Burrell, for being a tower of strength to this beautiful woman that the world will keep in their hearts forever.y like down deep inside thier evil, selfish and blackened hearts, oooh -- this one tells the tale and spins it like no other book on the topic of the Royal Family.<BR>I really detest the concept of a \\"Royal\\" blood line, with even deeper contempt than ever since I finished reading this fine book.

Once the prions get a hold of your neurons, it passes on messages and in no time at all, your brain is a messed-up avalanche of a tangled mess of metal folding chairs, as if an 18 wheeler truck mistakenly drove through.<br />PRIONS our our newest microscopic foe, and doctors don't know how to kill them without also killing the victim.<br />The victim gets the prion infestation by eating infected meat, and for all we know, those cows in Britian had an outbreak and the heards were slaughtered in order to prevent them from infecting other cattle world-wide.<br />Sure hope it worked.<br />After scaring the bee-jezus outta the reader, the book finally winds down to what we can do about germ warfare, overuse of antibiotics and development of probiotics and other potential weapons against microbes that mutate and reconform their outer membranes to keep fooling man kind from killing them.<br />Hey - it's gonna be us or them.....somebody please pass the Ciprofloxacin!d mess of metal folding chairs, as if an 18 wheeler truck mistakenly drove through.<BR>PRIONS our our newest microscopic foe, and doctors don't know how to kill them without also killing the victim.<BR>The victim gets the prion infestation by eating infected meat, and for all we know, those cows in Britian had an outbreak and the heards were slaughtered in order to prevent them from infecting other cattle world-wide.<BR>Sure hope it worked.<BR>After scaring the bee-jezus outta the reader, the book finally winds down to what we can do about germ warfare, overuse of antibiotics and development of probiotics and other potential weapons against microbes that mutate and reconform their outer membranes to keep fooling man kind from killing them.<BR>Hey - it's gonna be us or them.....somebody please pass the Ciprofloxacin!	2003-10-23

What drew me to purchase \\"The English Roses,\\" were the colorful and bright illustrations created by Jeffrey Fulrimari.  He draws with much energy and originality; the English Rose girlie-girls are unique and unlike anything you've seen before.<br />It has alot of the same appeal as little French Madeline, and that I find very refreshing and beautiful.<br />The storyline is one typically found amongst our little girls, (peer jealousy.) There is no mention about eight year old boys in the storyline..which is a shame, since I bought this book for my eight year old son. He is an excellent reader and I wanted to reward him with a colorful new book that would magically arrive at our doorstep after school.  He didn't really appreciate reading the book, he said it was, \\"All about silly girls,\\" but he did enjoy the drawings.<br />Perhaps her next book will focus more on boyhood musings; for her adorable little son's interests. Madonna's first effort in children's books is a credible one, and it would be nothing without the fabulous illustrations done by Mr. Jeffrey.<br />The lead charactor, Binah, is a reflection of what it must have been like growing up in young Madge's shoes....<br />She came from nowhere and had not much, and grew to be a rock and roll icon, and she never quite got over the hurt that other women inflict on her because they are jealous of her success.<br />Perhaps this story is a way for Madonna to let others know she is not a threat, but can be a good and worthy friend ....<br />A delightful reading experience!<br />It promotes the thinking that girls can grow up to be anything their hearts desire...and this is the best lesson ever because it's TRUE>>>>>......even grown women can learn something important from this book.	2003-09-21

Washing one's hands was a revolutionary idea back in sick houses in the 1840's...was it really too much trouble to keep one's hands spiffed up while delivering babies?  This book explores many medical marvels taken for granted; such as the discovery of the x-ray, and how kidney transplantation evolved.  It is told in a way that facinates.  Who would be brave enough to innoculate one's own child against smallpox way back when such a thought could result in inprisonment?  Yet, these brilliant medical amatuers dared to venture into areas that placed them in a most unflattering light.  These smart people were true mavericks; a type of individual who was smart enough to see past medical tradition and look into logical realities in medicine.  They were crazy and tenacious enough to hold onto these ideas while everyone else took their sweet time catching up to their revolutionary ideas.  Author, Julie Fenster did alot of research into germ theory and the art of medicine.  Much thinking is inspired while one contemplates -- where did our modern surgeries come from?  This book explores the major discoveries of our modern, western medicine and it also dares to implore those blessed with scientific minds to keep pushing ahead with ideas that may be with held within logical day dreams.  I enjoyed the science behind this book because it was written with alot of heart. I think any enterprenour would enjoy this book; all 281 pages of it.  Oh yes, and a small word about animal experimentation -- the necesariness of it versus the evils of it are explained as well.  Plan on taking your time reading this; contemplation of one's medical practice may be an interesting side effect; (not an adverse reaction, but a positive force indeed.) Good reading!	2003-09-17

This book is written with historical accuracy and the author took great pains to get it right..down to the edgy details of fraction times.<br />There were times while I was reading this novel that I found myself scooting towards the edge of my chair, waving my arm and encouraging SEABISCUIT to WIN!<br />IT was very exciting and simply and beautifully written.  Ms Hillenbrand spent four long years composing this novel, which may be her masterpiece work.<br />I encourage all people who love horses and love to read to spend some time parked in front of this compelling book.<br />You will go away dazzled and will have learned a great deal about our nation - pre and post depression.	2003-09-01

Once you slip this hot pink, fat little book out of it's book sleeve, you will be impressed and amazed by the beautiful victorian-flavored drawings inside of it.<br />I got it because of the artwork contained within, and one would be happily engaged in this book once they knew of the visual treats they were about to encounter.<br />This book has limited dialogue pertaining to the history of food -- finding it - preparing it - serving it and eating it. Which I feel ADDs to the book on the whole.<br />There are not many books on this planet that offer so much optical enjoyment for so little money.<br />Check the price; you will be tempted to want one for your own book collection.  It inspires a person to take out the old charcols and dabble in an artful composition or two.<br />I love this book, and so will you!	2003-07-11

Harry's life seems to be spiraling out of control in this adventure, but what can one expect of a young wizard who is adopted by mean muggles and is world famous and secretly wealthy?  JK Rowling did another superb job of it, but I think it was a bit stretched out and tiring.<br />\\"HE WHO SHOULD NOT BE NAMED,\\" really is getting worn out, why the heck don't we just call him by his name and pare down the page count, Ms Rowling?  What's the big deal about saying his name -- VOLDEMORT?  It's really a silly old name, you know.<br />I am not devouring this book in the same manner that I relished the first four books.  It's hard to pinpoint what the problem with the writing is, although I can start with<br />too much familiarity  in the plot development.<br />There is also alot of jibberish baggage in the subplot evolution, for instance - I forget who Cedric is, and what are Phineas?  It gets more complex as the plot thickens...<br />Honestly now, JK Rowling has all the money in the world...I think she should stop writing now while people still pay attention.  Perhaps the sixth book will not be such a show stopper after # 5.  Have fun reading this one....it'll take a while.  All 870 * pages of it; pass the VISINE !	2003-07-07

If you are one of the few people in this world who LOVES her/his job each and every day, consider yourself extraordinarily LUCKY! (You many think of this book as wasteful of your time.)  As for the rest of us, we could use a little deep thinking on the subject of what it is that we DO for a paycheck.<br />Do we need to keep doing what we are doing - or should we change it?<br />This handy little book explores the things some people did that were GOOD, and what other people did that were NOT so good at all.  The reader is encouraged to apply what she has read, and hopefully - it will transform the trajectory of her life....The aim is to redirect oneself into a life more worthy.  After all - professional work requires tons of personal effort..shouldn't it be fun at least SOME OF THE TIME???  If this book helps someone to spend some valuable time examining thier professional life; it is well worth it.<br />No, this handy little book will NOT TELL YOU WHAT TO DO with your life -- it only begs the questions -- is what you're doing worth one's effort, and do you really wish to waste much more time spinning your wheels at something you HATE and DETEST doing?<br />One can appreciate the interviews Mr. Bronson conducted, and the time he spent traveling alone in order for himself to reflect on his career as well.<br />I'd say Bronson is in the right business.<br />I found the book to be most inspiring.<br />One additional unexpected bonus (that means nothing at all)...Mr. Bronson is surprisingly handsome.  Not to insinuate that authors are bad looking, but I was pleasantly surprized to see his lovely face at the end of the book.<br />If he gets tired of writing, I suppose he could choose modeling as a career alternative!  HA!	2003-07-07

Grishim manages to capture the frantic, craziness of the holiday season on this thin little book that one can read in one night, providing they are all through with their Christmas shopping -- UGH!<br />Definitely, pick this one up next time you're out spending way too much money on everyone except yourself.  Drop the few bucks $$$ and splurge on a little literary enjoyment just for little ole YOU!  I think you're in for a treat.<br />Reading a short book is such a great diversion during Christmas time, and you'll be tempted to do what the main couple do in the story.<br />Oh yesssss........once you see how they plan on skipping Christmas, you'll plan your escape as well.<br />Happy Holidays!	2003-06-19

It'll paint some pretty pictures in your head....if you saw it on TV already, that's okay.<br />The book is much better .... really.	2003-06-19

Places like convalescent homes, hospitals, old theaters and old restaraunts feel so familiar and friendly to the living because our departed family members and good friends still hover over them...not all the time....but Sebold expands on the possibility of what the dearly departed do with all their spare time.  It's creativly written with kindness of heart and gentleness of the soul....and it encourages us all to believe in the goodness of angels near and far.<br />Sebold explains in a comforting way what Heaven will be like for us all on our fateful departure from Earth...<br />Heaven is unique to each individual - it is the stuff of our simplest dreams...and every Heaven is expandable and you make new friends....FAMILY however, is always family and there can never be additions to it unless it is created on Earth.<br />There is a lot of sadness surrounding young Susie Salmon's death --- but life goes on --- life goes on ---<br />and the dead never want us to be saddened by our loss of them.<br />I think this book could help those who've lost loved ones to violence....its a real winner.	2003-06-14

Cremation is the only way to go.
