For a first effort, it's quite interesting and I'll be foreward to  reading what else this Eloise puts out.<br />Also would like to mention the  cover:  Just Love It.  I'm sick of those cheesy covers.	2000-04-29

What made this pretty much bearable- the storyline was quite dull itself- was the humor.  The author portrayed herself as a sarcastic little thing, with one liners that killed.  The most memorable was when her  family had to be checked and made sure they were Jews, as they claimed to  be, by their rescuers.  Her grandmother (I assume was in her late 80s)  suffered from Asthma, could hardly move, and was nearly blind yet was  accused of being a spy of some sorts.  That isn't supposed to be funny  under any circumstances, but the way the author worded it was hilarious.   Absolutely hilarious.  Which is odd contrasting against the wars and  hardships she had to face.	2000-04-03

Books	2	30	39	N	N	Lacks a Body	Hilarious, enjoyable introduction; really got me hyped up to learn the words that were to follow.  Okay, so when I hit the words my mind goes blank.  Why?  I see, well, common words, heck, EASY words.  Words you're  already supposed to know.  I flip through the book hoping it would advance,  but no, it was consistant, simple words.  Words like &quot;mundane&quot;  and &quot;supplement&quot;.  Uh huh.  Sure, I didn't know what  &quot;avarice&quot; was (used as an example in the excellent introduction),  but, hey, the 500 words in this book are a joke!<br />This isn't the most  challenging book out there.

Excellent.  But the greatest plus is that the paper it's printed on is great; none of that cheap yellowing rice-paper  thin paper Princeton uses.  Great stuff.  And the paper's pretty flimsy  (yet still unusually strong) so you can bend the pages back without  creasing the spine.  Ordinarily, the aesthetic value of the book,  unfortunately, is what matters in the end to me.  If it looks terrible, I  just won't do it, just lose the energy.  Can't really explain that, but the  last line is you HAVE to get this book at the very least for the SATs.	2000-04-01

There are mounds of fantasy titles out now aimed at adolescent-teenagers, just as this book, but this in particular stands out quite by itself.  While it contains the elements to keep a  teenager entertained, it's a delicious read for adults as well.  The author  mentioned something about enjoying Jane Austen's works in the  &quot;interview with Sherwood Smith&quot;; the protagonist in this book  finds herself caught up in similar situations as Elizabeth Bennet of Pride  &amp; Prejudice did.  <br />Oddly enough, I enjoyed this book just as well as  my friend's 16 year old daughter did.  Now, isn't that ironic?	2000-02-18

I must say it's quite an impressive debut for a book, especially for someone of her age.

The characters were instantly compelling, especially Sheftu, whom I have grown greatly interested in.  No other character in any other book has had  such a pulling ability (then again, there IS Shevraeth from &quot;Crown  Duel&quot; and &quot;Court Duel&quot;).

I found it unusual how none of &quot;Ducky's&quot; faults were mentioned  while the author took ever oppertunity to hit down her family members.   Clearly, this is a biased biography, however compelling the history itself  WAS.  <br />And as a previous reviewer had mentioned, I do not see how Ducky  was such a beauty.  The pictures of her frightened me... her overlong, thin  nose and drooping cheeks were painful to look at.  There must be another  biographer out there who has depicted Ducky under a more truthful light.	1999-12-13

I found a well weaved story with a cast of at least eight or so characters to keep track of.  One chapter would have endless  paragraphs that switch from one point of view to another, quite  interesting, but rather confusing and it got kind of dull after a  while.<br />Nevertheless, a must if you've read &quot;The Baker's Boy&quot;.	1999-03-31

Hollis was a nice lover for March, until he turned greedy, rich, and rude.  March was headstrong, but was weak and always followed  Hollis.  The wonder of this story was March's daughter, who was working  with her own problems of love, just like how her mother did years ago and  still is now.<br />Timeful and captive tale, complex and a horror to read, but  satisfying in the end.  One great Oprah pick, I love Alice Hoffman now.	1999-03-31
