The stories cover a wide range of criminals, their crimes and the individuals victimized.  By including different authors, the styles of each contrast nicely as each weaves his or her own tale.  Each story and storyteller is unique.  I have read the 2002 and the 2003 edition and this book lives up to its predecessors' lofty standards.	2005-09-29

Mann's focus is on Congress and the particular members who took on the Johnson and Nixon administrations.  Mann goes into great detail concerning Congress' abdication of power and responsibility in its passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.  This theme of abdication forms the lense which all subsequent action is viewed.  The bitter divisions in Congress and amongst the American people are on full display.  Heavily researched and written in an easy to read style, I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the subject.	2005-06-25

Given some of the restrictions inherent in this book, the author did an admirable job.  As a prequel to Episode III, Luceno was hemmed in by the opening scene of Revenge of the Sith and the previous novels written which follow Episode II.  The characters give out plenty of background information and tie plot lines up giving the reader context for Episode III.  The story telling works quite well and I would recommend this book to any Star Wars fan.	2005-06-25

I would compare this book to sitting down with some crazy guy at a bar and listening to him ramble on for a few hours.  The book had the feel of random musings by Louis Pasciuto.  The author was either unable or unwilling to look to other sources in writing Pasciuto's story.  You never hear from any of his victims.  You never hear from any of the other people involved in these fraudulent schemes so the reader is left at the bar with only the word of Louis Pasciuto.  Now the book did elicit some emotion from me as I learned about Louis.  While some readers may be enamored or humored by this guy, he comes across to me as the worst type of thief and general bad guy.  Definitely worth reading, but if you are looking for something more comprehensive and well researched, look for anything by James Stewart who is a MASTER at his craft.	2005-06-17

Originally published in 1989, Guy Gugliotta and Jeff Leen have written an astonishing account of the rise of the Medellin cocaine cartel.  The book is well researched and the pacing keeps you turning pages.  The authors were able to connect a number of separate dots which give the reader a clear picture of the enormity of the drug trade in the late 70's and early 80's.  The organization of the drug lords (Escobar, Ochoa, etc.), the men aligned against them and the other bit players caught in between are all brought to life in a fascinating and well written book.	2005-05-27

The influence of 9/11 and terrorism is abundant.  But many of the other stories delve into a more \\"bizarre\\" area of crime and the criminal mind.  While none of the articles blew me away, all were solid and interesting.  Anyone looking for true crime from a slightly different angle should look here.	2005-05-27

Many of the subjects and anecdotes covered by Feldman are old news.  The \\"Cane Mutiny\\" really didn't cover anything new or information we hadn't heard before (I am an LSU fan but I was familiar with a number of stories Feldman presented).  Plus the book didn't really settle into any sort of rhythm, Feldman fasts forwards thru the lean years of the mid 90's while the \\"U\\" was on probation, but covers the recent National Championship runs heavily.  I got the impression Feldman didn't do a lot of original research or interview many former players and coaches.  Feldman takes a, \\"that's just the way Miami is\\" attitude about Miami's bad boy image and shenanigans on the field which may bother some folks.  This is a fun read, but don't expect much insight.	2005-04-26

Much more so in Europe than in the US, professional sports are closely intertwined with politics and culture.  As noted in this book, some owners use their soccer clubs as a political base of support.  And in turn, many fans use the games and the clubs to express political points of view, sometimes verging on the extreme. (English Hooligans?)  The corruption in Brazil's political structure manifests itself in the decline of the professional Brazilian league.  Many of Brazil's top players move to Europe to enjoy the many benefits of less corrupt capitalist countries.  While Foer's theory is way off base, the book is fascinating and a great read for anyone interested in soccer issues beyond the pitch.	2005-04-16

Books	4	5	16	N	N	Liberals will hate it....	Stossel intelligently lays waste to many of the sacred cows of the liberal left and some on the conservative right.  He touches on a key point which many people don't care about or delude themselves on: THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHTS AND SPEND YOUR MONEY IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE YOU \\"FEEL\\" SAFER.  The problem is you aren't any better off than before.  You end up with fewer rights, less money and you are no safer or better off than before.  The essential problem with the left is that they \\"know\\" (I use this term very loosely) they are smarter than you and that you are too stupid to make your own decisions and take care of yourself.  Thus you need government to tell you what to do and what not to do.  He even touches on an individual's right to die if they so choose.  While this is a big issue with the conservative right, Stossel is right on saying, \\"butt out!\\"  A very interesting book to get you thinking about your rights and how your tax dollar is spent, just don't expect a liberal to be open minded enough to even read what Stossel has to say.	2005-04-16
US	50539677	REQZFM16HWWYU	0449002918	290731200	Killing Season	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Eating their young	As I got to the end of \\"The Killing Season\\" I couldn't help but notice that all of the murders covered by the detectives primarily featured ran together in a blur.  I found myself asking, \\"Now which shooting was this? How was this guy killed?\\"  I don't know if this was Corwin's desired affect, but it gives the reader an idea of the workload these detectives are under.  I am an Assistant District Attorney in south Louisiana and at a certain point the criminals and their crimes blur into each other.  There are always cases that stick out because of special circumstances or some bizarre aspect of the case, but many just fall into a big amorphous blob.  The real message of the book in my mind is the complete disregard for life by the killers.  The gangbangers in \\"The Killing Season\\" think nothing of executing a complete stranger for a few dollars.  While not a good as Corwin's \\"Homicide Special,\\" this work provides an accurate picture of a culture of violence which infects some of our communities.	2005-04-16

I was amazed at the weight given to political considerations by Johnson and his administration.  Johnson's focus on his Great Society programs and re-election trumped his concerns over American men sacrificing their lives in Vietnam.  The lasting impression I got from Johnson's handing of Vietnam was that he was completely befuddled and hoped the problem would resolve itself with the insertion of more men and more money.  Grave foreign crisis require leaders.  Unfortunately for the people of America, Johnson was not up to the task.  Dallek's portrait of Johnson shows a President unwilling (or unable?) to make the hardest decisions in the realm of foreign affairs.	2005-03-21

Outside of the general map in the front of the book, there are none.  This takes away from an excellent recounting of the Tet Offensive as it related to Saigon.  The numerous quotes and straightforward writing style make this a very good read.	2005-03-08

Easily one of the top true crime books I have ever read.  Corwin has an eye for detail but doesn't get bogged down in minutia or wordiness.  The pacing of the investigations lead to many, \\"ok, I'll read one more chapter then quit\\" episodes.  The detectives' sense of humor and dark view of the underbelly of society is genuine and genuinely funny.  Even the best fiction does not grab my attention like Corwin did.  This work is on par with David Simon's \\"Homicide.\\"  Simply put, a must read.	2005-01-19

Well written and interesting, this work by Alan Clark suffers from a few noticeable shortcomings.  On the positive side, I was intrigued by the description of the plotting of the Eastern Generals against Hitler.  But the coverage was only cursory and for background information as Clark focused on the military aspects of the conflict rather than the political machinations of the upper echelon of the German military and civilian leadership.  A more complete coverage of the plots would have been welcome.<br /><br />  As for the negatives, given that Barbarossa is focused on the military engagements on the Eastern Front, maps are essential to fully understand the ebb and flow of the conflict.  But with only a few maps, I had to repeatedly look at other sources to take the abstract descriptions given by Clark and place them geographically.<br /><br />  The other issue that cropped up was Clark's rather sympathetic view of Hitler.  While acknowledging the fact a number of elements factored into Germany's military failures, Clark seems to give Hitler a free pass for the most part.  The infighting between staffs and the personal ambitions of the generals are allowed to blossom seemingly with Hitler's consent.  The debacle at Stalingrad is a direct result of Hitler's unwillingness to accept any sort of withdrawal.  These are just a few examples where I feel Clark is not as critical of Hitler as he should be.  Despite these quibbles, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in the Eastern Front of WWII.	2005-01-07

The book covers from the Barbarian tribes of the 6th century to the Mongol and Turk empires of the 15th century.  Most of the major military engagements are covered along with the notable leaders of the respective periods.  I found the general discussions of the political and military situations very interesting.  But I got bogged down in the details concerning the make up of various armies.  This work is a highly detailed account of tactics, formations and arms and equipment.  Anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of medieval warfare will enjoy this book.	2004-11-09

James Stewart is one of the top two or three writers whose work I have had the pleasure to read.  He is meticulous in his reporting and his research is unassailable.  The more I read, the more terrified I became that someone could actually \\"skate\\" through the system for so many years leaving a wake of corpses in his path.  Stewart is a remarkable storyteller who can't be missed.  The evil Dr. Swango comes alive in this fine work.	2004-11-09

Each chapter covers the important players and coaches from each school.  However, if you are looking for anything deeper, go elsewhere.  None of the big issues, i.e. segregation/integration or cheating/NCAA violations are covered.  The book does a great job of accomplishing Warner's goals.

The book is more memorable for Paterno's musings on life, recruiting, winning, losing and growing up with a strong mother rather than for his specific thoughts on the numerous games he has coached.  Assuming the book is in fact an accurate portrayal of Paterno, it is clear that he will never voluntarily step down from Penn State, no matter how bad things get.  He is determined and driven to succeed.  He will not quit and he will not go quietly.  From many of his remarks in the book about Penn State, it is clear he feels the same way a number of his supporters do, Penn State owes Joe loyalty for his many years of service.  A solid sports book about sports...and life.	2004-07-26

The book moves slowly at first, but picks up as the Japanese begin to put plans and thoughts into action.  Thoroughly researched and footnoted, the book covers the pre-war planning, the attack and the aftermath.  I found the coverage of the post attack investigations and congressional hearings fascinating in light of the current 9/11 Commission.  The author is fair and presents the facts in a manner that allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions about the causes/failures/mistakes regarding the destruction of a large portion of the US Pacific Fleet.	2004-07-01

Rather than covering the history of the Iron Bowl, this book deals exclusively with the 2000 Alabama/ Auburn game.  The story is interesting given that Mike Dubose, the Alabama coach, was going to be fired at the end of the season and knew it going into the game.  But the gloom surrounding the Alabama program, coaches and players puts a damper on the game and subsequently the book.  Turning the pages, I almost felt that I was \\"going thru the motions\\" trying to get to the end the book just as Alabama was \\"going thru the motions\\" trying to get to the end of the season.  I am sure Auburn fans will really enjoy the book while the Crimson Tide faithful will probably want to avoid reliving the awful 2000 season.  For the average college football fan, there are probably a number of books you could turn to before looking here.	2004-07-01

The writer sets the stage for each scintillating finale with a few pages then cuts to describing the play itself.  The beauty of the book is the included CD which contains the radio calls from these game defining plays.  I am an LSU fan and there are two LSU games (both wins thank goodness) in the book and on the CD.  I was at one of the games and being able to listen and relieve the moment is a treat.  Anyone who loves a fantastic finish should get this book.	2004-05-28

The book covers the great coaches, teams and rivalries of the past 100 years.  There are a number of wonderful photos sprinkled through the book as well.  The writing touches on a number of subjects in brief articles, so don't look for any in depth stories about one particular program, coach or player.  This is not a complaint, merely an observation.  My only real complaint is the errors I found.  Some photos misidentified players and bits of information were incorrect (minor errors, but annoying none the less).  Overall, this is a great book for any college football fan.	2004-05-28

While initially slow, I enjoyed the character development and really appreciated the introductory thoughts of Drizzt beginning each chapter.

Clancy's best novels (Red Storm Rising and Clear and Present Danger to name two) were filled with action and suspense, not chapter long diatribes about such issues as abortion, population control and domestic politics.  I see that Clancy is trying to move in a different direction with his writing, but it just comes of as contrived and preachy.  Until he returns to his former style, I will be passing on all his future books.	2003-06-10
