US	49400436	R1W7EA7MMDS0QP	0142437174	474714897	The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	By and by, it's a darn good book.	What Ernest Hemingway called, \\"the best book we've had,\\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is written in a southern slang that is initially difficult to follow, yet, once you learn to follow Huck's voice, it becomes a revelation of the human spirit.  Huck Finn is a derelict boy on the run from his drunken, abusive father in the late 19th century.  Along with his friend, Jim-a runaway slave-Huck travels down the Mississippi on a raft and learns about the ironies of life in a pious yet oppressive society.  Twain uses Huck's ignorance to reveal the truths that were tearing America apart, and he does so with such grace and flare that I found myself indignant with laughter at the follies of a national doctrine.  Even though slavery has been abolished, the book is still relevant today, describing a boy's awakening to the world around him, and how he-morals, judgement, and upbringing-fits into that world.  A moving, fun, and insightful read, I found some of the most impressive moments in literature within the covers of this book; I hope you will too.	2004-02-03

The kids are growing well within the story, unfortunately JK's overall story and writings aren't.  She gets lost in what she is writing -- a kids book? a young readers book? an adult book that the young will like? -- developing her vocabulary yet neglecting her sentence complexity and stylistic grace -- she impertinantely uses words such as supercilious unnessisarily, and has yet to learn how to use a comma.  I think she is struggling to find her own voice as these kids grow up.  It is ever apperant that she is also struggling to find fresh plot points: she leaks spoilers such as, \\"Someone in Harry's group is going to die,\\" and then sets up scenarious that trick the reader into thinking that a this person is dead, only to find out that they were only asleep...ho-hum, so lame, so purile.  The books are for buding readers, not to be read like they've been written by one.  Hopefully, for her next book,  after spending a few more years as a professional writer, we will finally see her develop her writing.	2004-02-03

It's a fun book; i read it in two days; still, it's a step behind the first three Dark Tower stories--not as slow and deliberate as Wizard and Glass, which fortunately did have its moments of brilliance--yet it does find invention, passion, and voice in a tale that is worthy of Roland and his gang.  <br />The scenes involving the uninteresting and childish Calla folk seemed lengthy and dry, often reading like a bland screen play, but King has not lost it--I did give this book 4 stars, after all--but King has set a bench mark for himself that, yes, even he has difficulty reaching.  The book hits its peak with Father Callahan and his telling our ka-tet the story of 'salem's lot.  It also rides high during the ka-tet's journeys in, yes, that's right, New York.  King writes here with the type of passion and flare we rarely see in popular fiction--when we do see it, it is usually from the pen of the King himself--proving that his word prosessor still has some gas in it, as long as he puts the appropriate effort into it.	2004-01-30

And what a tale it is!  A cop who has &quot;fallen through the cracks of society&quot; goes on a long walk to reclaim himself; Babylon 5 fans will be reminded of &quot;Walkabout&quot;, but this goes where that could not.  Into the lions den.  JMS's best work in the genre and his best work since B5.  Briliant.  The artistry is the best for any comic work i've seen, just might be the best comic I've ever read--sorry Mr. Gaiman.  The price is peanuts compared to what you get, education and entertainment in one--Straczynski style.  SWEET!	2003-03-17

But after the protagonist has his epiphany by beating his writers block the story turns an intelligent voice into an 'R' rated Scooby Doo cartoon with rediculas characters and beat you over the head gory, violent ghost scenes/dreams/visions?  I don't mind the fun, trashy stuff, but it is too bad that Mr. King didn't continue with the subtlness and mystery instead of explaining everything.  I am reluctant to critisize Stephen King's books, because I understand them and because I respect what he does, so no hard feelings.  Oh, and by the way, what a great first 500.	2003-03-16

No great moral or message, but fun.  And what's wrong with that?  King has the ability in inject wicked emotion with abstact imagination and there are scenes in the Dreamcatcher that rank with his best: the escapade of the eggman, the bacon fest (ew!), and Jonesy's veiwing of Sympathy for the Grayboys; they reminded me of the Trash Can Man's trip to Vegas with the Kid--roaring with freaks and fun.

And the story of sacrafice.  I look at the critics of Stephen King and shake my head.  Because sometimes our greatest gifts are lost in the narrow minds of what people expect instead of what people are given.  A story about textured prison guards trying to deal with the only things they have in a difficult time: family and carreer.  And these workmen get introduced to a man who makes them question what they do--they put people to death for a living.  And the events that succeed are amazing, inspiring, and devistating.  With coincidence and (or) devine intervention they are changed, and I was changed, and felt a sadness infest my life, because the hope that I wished for was hidden in the miricals and treacheries of the events of the story.  But that's okay, because the points in between are where I lie, and that makes the magic of seeing the extremes ever more poingant.  Just a beautiful book.	2003-02-25

Some horror, some imagined history, some down right disturbing, and 2 tales related to the dark tower--all with a little bit of the Kingian humour.  About halfof  the shorts were okay, not brilliant, but fun; but the other half were very moving:  <br />The Man in the Black Suit<BR>This could be an ancient fable about innocents and evil colliding.  It won the O. Henry award for best short.  Great read.  <br />Everything's Eventual<BR>My favorite of the bunch.  A look at what happenes when we let others look after us and assume that they have our best interest at heart.  Usually they don't, and the consequences that develop can be just as disturbing as, say a Stephen King story.  <br />The Road Virus Heads North<BR>Is the only written story that I can remember being completely wigged out by. It is inspired by a picture that Stephen King hangs in his office, and the description of this picture alone is creepy.  (narrator shutters)  <br />The Little Sisters of Eluria<BR>A good tale from Roland's younger days.  Not great, but fun and for you gunslinger fans, any thing about the Tower is a blessing.  (By the way,Mr. King has just officially finished writing the last Dark Tower book, #V will be out in Nov, #VI in the following June, and #VII in the next Nov.  Yeah!!!)  <br />LT's Theory of Pets<BR>King's favorite of the bunch, goes from being very funny to very disturbing, a story  that anyone who has had a dog or a cat will find very amussing.  <br />I love the short story format.  It is great that Mr. King has not abandoned it.  He calls them one night stands instead of a long love affair, like The Stand or IT.  Thanks for the fun.	2003-02-24

Not all of it: he himself has admitted that he has written some uninspiring stories, but this is not one of those. No, this story is tuff and very emotional from its powerful begining right up to its sad ending. It's a slow story--a sad story.  It's the story of a family; not a regular family, but the family of highway patrol troop D; and its the story of the love and the anger that family members evoke from each other--King describes this with incredible sorrow. As i read this book i felt heavy hearted, down right sad--in a beautiful way, though. Imagine that.  Told with unique perspective, there are six narrators--and each voice is strong save for Shirley's (it's with her where i find the only problem with the book--cliche female narration.)  <br />Buick 8 has its fantasy elements, and they are fun, damn creepy at times; but the story shines brightest when Sandy Dearborne narrates--his anger with the young Ned Wilcox who is trying to deal with the greef of a fallen father (another State trooper named Curt) is painful. Sandy sees so much of Curt in Ned that it frustrates him to hell through high water because he sees the kid making the same mistakes that the father struggled with, and he's angry at Ned, and with Ned's father, but only because he loved Curt like a brother, and because he loves Ned like a nephew.  And it is this conflict where we see King at his best, mirroring the emotion that we saw in Hearts in Atlantis and in The Green Mile.  A beautiful story showing us that King is like a fine wine: gets better with age. Pick it up--it is well worth the price.	2003-02-18

It is better than the first two and the first two were great.  They are a real marvelle of story telling and allegory.  I love the journey aspect of the story.  The will to risk all to get to place, in hope of better answers.  The readers are taken on this journey as much as the characters are.  And the characters are taken on a fast pace, break neck ride.  I am going to start reading #4 imediately as I must know what happens.  I just hope that King gets the rest of the books out soon, but I also don't want him to rush it.  Great art takes time to develop and this is great art.  It is by far my favorite of King's works as his characters are funny, twisted, and inteligent.  They all play off each other very well, and we learn about them through how they treat each other.  Roland is developing into a solid leader who now is developing interests outside the dark tower in Jake, Eddie, Susannah-his posse.  And they all bring something to the story.  This book made me think.  And then it twisted my thoughts intop a fury of paradoxes that turn inside out.  Trippy stuff.  Read this book!!!	2002-09-10

It starts out with magnificent discription telling of sea creatures attacking the GunSlinger, as he escapes, gravely wounded, he dicovers a portal to another world in another time.  We are introduced the three characters -The Prisoner, a story that is wild and nerve racking.  It is centered around a great character, Eddie.  The next chapter -the Lady of Sadows, is truely disturbing and difficult to read, but bear through it is worth it as the final chapter -The Pusher, makes -The Lady of Shadows very cool.  It is like eduring through a difficult race to feel incredible at its completion because the prize is unbelievable.  The three storys are subversively intertwined in much deaper detail that what King reveals to the reader, I was blown away at the end and instantly began the Waste Land -Dark Tower 3.

I don't think that anyone has ever been so skilled in writing a sentence before than D.H. Lawrence.  He writes such poetic prose that he can make a walk in the park the most entertaining scene in a book.  It is just beautiful and it is something that is zll too rare in modern lierature.  There is one scene when he describes a man and a women walking beside a pond at night and the lady is pulling the petals off of a white flower and throwing them onto the pond.  As they float away the picture that Lawence paints in the readers mind is poingant and very descriptively beautiful.  The characters are described down to their inner most thoughts and we see them and get to know them better than they know themselves.  The y are conflicted, insecure, and hopeful of finding something worth while.  Lawrence pulls out the problems that society places on love, mixed with the conflicting human spirit with refreshing honesty.  At times the characters drove me crazy as they couldn't make up their minds, they were so capricious.  But then people are like that in life, so it fit in well with the main message of the story: searching for the offered love that appeases our trepidations about relationships.  I will never view a relationship the same after reading this book as it was so insightful on what we need.  More people should read D.H. Lawrence's works as they are lessons to help us define ourselves in a deaper perspective and in a more awake fashion.	2002-08-25

From the opening sentence to the final word it is gripping and disturbing. Painting a world that the reader is glad to not be apart of, yet fascinated to read about, the story creeps along slowly revealing the protagonist and his intention. Only in the last chapter do we find out what has been happening to him and why he is on this journey. If it is a success is up to the reader to determine, but it definately fullfills its potential with a spellbinding conversation that is as provokative as Aurthor C Clarke's 2001: A Space Odysse. A remarkable tail of travel that's a combination of magic, mystery and journey, a mysterious hero and a dark and equivicol villian. This is just the begginning of the remarkable tale of the dark tower that King has yet to complete. Four episodes have been released so far and i have just started the drawing of the three.

The first chapter is one of the most difficult chapters that i have ever read, describing the parents ascent to death, but after that it lightens up telling a warm story of the strength of family in a flippant voice of twisted priority and inaduqacy.

James Joyce had a life worthy of study and it is parlayed in this novel with passion and art combined, in equal measure.  It drives down the path of a young man's struggle to find truth in religeon, which does not excist beyond metaphorical reasoning.  When the protagonist realises this, he defrocks his faith in christianity and searches for answers else where.  It is difficult for the reader in our era to understand the pressures that must have been placed on a young man growing up in a catholic shcool and to dissolve his interest in religeon, but it shows the strength that Joyce had for his convictions and desires.  A brilliant read telling a story with an amalgam of fiction and non-it truely is delivered in a wonderful and original fashion.

The author created a slang language in it that was a mix of cockney and russian slang.  The outcome is a funny yet disturbing piece of prose that at times reads like poetry.  It is vicious with a point.  The author is fighting a conflict between being evil or being good because you have no choice.  It reminded me of the Catholic religion and Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.  Are you being good because you are afraid of the consiquences of being bad or are you being good because it feels like it is the rite thing for you to do.  Living life as you see it should be lived.  You don't kill or rape because a Religious law tells you it is sin; instead you don't do these things because you know that they are wrong.  This is what Nietzsche called living beyond good and evil.  And it has neve being better protrayed than in this book.  A clock work orange.	2002-07-03

I have only had such fun in reading a book in a select few other occasions.  It is my favorite of Tolkien's works and that is saying a lot.  It is an adventure beyond the magical as it shows the power of wit and inner strength.  Being called the precurser to the Lord of the Rings does not do it justice.  It is simply the most universally enjoyable story that I have ever read. I do not remember ever laughing so hard from a book.  It brought a boundless smile to my face.

It is something that I think should be read aloud as ther reader will be able to put the sounds together in a more coherent structure.  It is enigmatic and incomprehensable.

In the second piece to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the story gets divided up into two parts.  The first is concerning Arogorn and Gimli and Legolas and it is my favorite part of the series.  Tolkien is a master at building up the tension and then leaving the reader hanging by moving on to another side of the story.  The timing and portrail of the story is the best there is for story telling in any fashion.  The second part moves on to Frodo and Sam's journey into Mordor and it is eary and dark.  The description of this evil country leaves the reader thankful that he does not have to make such a journey himself.  The characters grow and are quite changed by the events that surround them.  I always thought that if the characters were not changed by a story, then how is the reader ever going to be affected?  Well, no lack of that here.

It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul. Probibly the greatest peice of art that i have ever absorbed but to readers beware; it is more an art than a typical novel.

Better than the Lord of the Rngs	In this final piece of an incredible trilogy, we are exposed to all the final revelations that are introduced in the following books. It also gives a deeper perspective on how Sheridan was able to bomd Z'Ha'Dum which is an amazing tale in itself. Each book has an amazing revelation in it that blows away any Harry potter book even though I like the Happy Potter's very much.  There is a twist that reveals a hidden truth that the reader was not even expecting. It is done with skillful legerdemain. I actually enjoyed these books more than the Lord of the Rings, and I LOVED the Lord of the Rings. If you like brilliant prose that is complex reading without having to strain you brain too much, then get all three as they are the most enjoyable books I have ever read. I finnished the trilogy in four days and that is over 1000 pages long. But don't pick the book up until you have a couple of days off as it could interfere with your job.   In this book we start off with the Techno Mages in hidding.  It sets a dark sence of death and insight into what it takes to develop the nessesary skills to become an effective and in control MAGE.  The story starts about one and a half years after the last one ended and Galen is still not talking with Elric for what he did.  You constantly tell Galen to smarten up and to give Elricc a chance but he does not.  Elric gives some very insightful speaches as does Galen and Lorien says something that I will never forget, \\"It is difficult to live your entire life and find that your answers have not ended the questions, only changed them.'  Absolutely brilliant.  One thing that Jeanne does in these books better tha any other that I have read is that she follows a rule that Mark Twain stated about writing.  \\"When you write, you should never preach overtly or teach overtly but you should preach covertly and teach covertly.

To give eveyone an idea how much i enjoyed this book, I read it in 10 hours straight. The first and third instalments were very fantastic as well but the middle edition was a revelation. If you like fantasy adventure than pick up this book and you will have a hard time putting it down; I promise that you wont be disapointed but you have to start with 'Casting Shadows.' The insight into human nature leads me to believe that the author was a psyhcology student because so much of the info based on the personal interaction and development were bang on.  This book ends up right where the last one left off with Kell meeting Elizar and confronting hiim about killing... well I won't tell in case you have yet to read the first edition, 'Casting Shadows'.  It is truely the most wonderfully compiled trilogy that I have ever read.  Please I beg of youto read this trilogy.  I actually liked it better than the Lord of the Rings.  which I absolutely loved.  Well Galen is pretty serene in this edition of the trilogy compared to the other two, first off he his no where nearly as emotional as he was in the first one which isn't saying much and he is not nearly as dark as he was in the following book, 'Invoking Darkness'.  Which is as dark as you will get for any science fiction story.  Considering that it is Babylon 5 it is pretty dark stuff.  Not to say that Babylon 5 wasn't dark because it definately had its moments like in \\"the Face of the Enemy\\" that was pretty disturbing .  But this was beyond all of what i have ever read before.  Which is saying a lot because I read about three books a week. In book two, Galen gets sent out on his second task for the circle and this one is as devastaeing as the first.  When Galen meets up with Elric and the rest of the Mages at the end, well let's just say that he is one messed up and disturbed kid.  This book also goes into the lone episode of  Babylon 5 that introduced the techno-Mages to us in: 'The Geometry of Shadows.'   It was perfect howwell the story fit into the episode making the episode that much better and the book gave us a look into Londo's decent into darkness.  Shame on you Londo!  I just love Galen's character the way he is so convinced that the Universe is out to get him and I promise that if you were in a similar life than you would probably agree with him.  Just when something seems to go his way he gets turned around into a maze of horrors concerning who he is or what he has done or what is happening to him.  Poor guy.  I just hope that I can convince someone to read this book so That i can share its majesty with some one.  Please enjoy.	2002-03-21
