Her son is sick, and Garth wants to hold back on revealing the startling news about his parentage until he gets better.<br />For the goodwill of their son, Garth and Amanda marry. However, it is unclear if this marriage will last since they've married for the son's health reasons.<br />Garth, a non-believer, refuses to receive Amanda's Christ, which is cause for a big conflict, and a rift in their relationship.<br />I thought this book was fairly good, but it did tend to drag in a few places. However, I would definately consider reading other books by this author.	2004-04-28

Philip has lost a loved-one also, and he finds himself drawn to the petite and striking Jemma. Jemma is determined to make a life on her own, without relying on Philip or her mother-in-law for support. Philip keeps popping in, offering her comfort and support, and she's unsure of how to respond to her growing feelings toward the man.<br />I thought the conflict was a bit cliched with both of them having loved and lost before. Also, I thought the author relied a little too much on the conflict of the age difference(Philip is about 17 years older than Jemma). The age was a big source of contention in the romance, which I felt took away from the story.<br />I'd recommend this book as a good read, and I'd also be interested in reading other books by this author.	2004-04-28

However, when Clay comes to town and works for the factory, he hides a secret, and when that secret is revealed, it shatters their romance to pieces. It's a good thing when they do, indeed, get together in the end.<br />This book was entertaining. I liked the fact that Kaitlyn had a dream, and she held back on her romance with Clay since she assumed he was in this small town to stay, working in the factory.<br />Clay's secret, his acting the role of a factory worker, just to find out who's sabotoging his father's business, is the catalyst that moves this story forward.<br />I think this book is a good, entertaining read when you just want to read a nice, short, love story.	2004-04-27

When they meet again, as adults, Jessamy has filled out into a beautiful young woman and Derek has lost all of his baby fat.

Jessamy lives far away, in another state, and they don't know if a long-distance relationship will work.<br />3. Jessamy wants to move back to Derek's town and sell her catering business, only to discover that Derek has found a job elsewhere, far from his hometown, and she'll need to follow him to his new location in order for the romance to work.<br />They pretend to be engaged, just to please Derek's boss so that he'll get a promotion.<br />This book is good to read when you don't want something filled with too much angst and sadness.	2004-04-26

When Paul Hudson is called to save a dying church, he takes on the job, bringing his wife Eunice and his young son with him. However, Paul's vengeance for saving souls is overcome with his desire to increase his church membership, and to make his coffers grow with tithes. Paul's sermons lose their spiritual message as he preaches in a way that would not offend non-believers. Soon he finds himself catering to the richer patrons of his church, and he enjoys &quot;kissing up&quot; to the upper crust of society in the small town. His wife Eunice is disheartened when her husband no longer preaches the gospel, and their marriage suffers greatly. When he has an affair with a parishioner, Eunice leaves her husband, and Paul chases after her, not wanting her to reveal the information about his affair to the parishioners. Meanwhile, Paul's relationship with his son has deteriorated so much that his son leaves home, to live with Paul's mother. Paul's son has always felt that his father has placed the needs of his church and his parishoners above the needs of his own family, and he feels unwanted, unloved, and slighted by his father's hypocritical behavior. A sudden event happens near the end of the story and it forces Paul to realize the mistakes he's made over the last twenty years of his life. He almost dies and he struggles to make amends with his mother, his wife, and his now nineteen-year-old son. Although the book was excellently written, I found it hard to believe the ending. It seemed too quick, and unbelievable, but the book itself was a good, exciting read, and I kept turning the pages until I'd reached the end.	2003-10-17

This book just shows that God can go through amazing lengths to prove his grace to mankind! Conrad discovers Jesus through an &quot;alternate&quot; universe. Jesus Christ is on earth during modern times, by the name of Eli! He performs miracles and he is denied by many people. Conrad accepts Christ in this &quot;alternate&quot; universe and becomes a saved man. He is in this &quot;other world&quot; while in a coma.  Instead of awakening from his coma, he dies at the end, however, Eli embraces him into the kingdom of heaven.<br />This book was an exciting read and I kept turning the pages. During Conrad's walk with Christ, he becomes a changed man. He learns to respect and love his ex-wife, Suzanne. He realizes the pain and heartache he has caused Suzanne and his daughter Julia. He repents for his sins, and embraces Suzanne in his life again.<br />This is also a story about forgiveness. Suzanne forgives Conrad for his sins, and Julia learns to release her bitterness towards her father. After years of silence, she releases her pain and embraces the Lord upon his death.<br />This story shows how close Jesus Christ really is. It show what it would be like to have him sit beside us while enjoying a baseball game. It made his miracles seem even more real than the ones we read about in the Bible(since it takes place during modern times)<br />I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good Christian fiction read...	2001-03-12

I felt that he should have had more restraint, especially for a Christian man.<br />Also, I thought it was odd that the female minister in this story did not tell Kyla and Jefferson that the Bible states infidelity is the only sin that's grounds for divorce in a marriage. She encouraged Kyla to forgive Jefferson and accept him back into her life. I felt that the couple needed more time apart and that Kyla should have made sure that this was the &quot;only&quot; time that Jefferson could be so &quot;easily&quot; seduced by a woman.<br />I did like the fact that Jasmine apologized for her behavior and turned to the Lord at the end.
