I don't know much about Mr. Daniel Silva but it feels as he lived through the events or at least was exposed to stories told by people, who lived through the events described in the book.   <br /> <br />This is a case, somewhat familiar, of a hunt for an old Nazi, who was able to escape the prosecution.  Yes, this approach was used on a number of times by many good writers in order to tell the story of the war, pain, terror, suffering, survival and escape of the criminal, who played the system and the system protected him.  All these books end up with some kind of a punishment but neither writer nor the reader are ever satisfied.  Even the worst punishment cannot restore the wrong done to so many innocent people and it never returns the dead.  But, nevertheless, the punishment is important and it has to be public in order for people to realize what happened and to what degree.  Also we hope that it would never happen again but it happens on a smaller scale as local genocides and as the terror spread out by the militant Muslims.  So, this book, as many others, is very important. <br /> <br />But what makes it different, standing out, personal?  When I was reading this book I had the feeling that Mr. Silva was very personal.  It was not just another thriller with the Israeli secret service and running around the world.  There was a painful story in the foundation of the book.  This story is so familiar to so many Jews around the world.  Every Jewish family had members, who perished during the war and not fighting the enemy but being starved and beaten to death, by being killed in so many ways, by being gassed and burnt and by being violated even after death through the denial of what the Nazis did.   <br /> <br />I believe Mr. Silva reached the \\"best so far\\" with this book.  Keep writing, Mr. Silva.  You are on the right way.        <br />	2004-08-14

I was pushing my books and he was working on his.  Frankly, we were not too busy.  We talked, we joked, we laughed a little but there was still no waiting line at our table.  So, we mostly enjoyed our own company.  At the end we decided to exchange books.  Mr. Kaplow gave me his \\"Me and Orson Welles\\" and I gave him mine \\"Miles of Experience\\".  Our autographs were proudly attached to the books.  We promised to each to read these books and to express our opinions.  I am keeping my word.  I read this wonderful book and I enjoyed it tremendously.  \\"Me and Orson Welles\\" is masterfully written, full of very healthy humor and strong characters.  Frankly, I could not put it down and I read a few books before.  I hope readers of this review would understand that I do not want to tell you the plot or to discuss it.

She spends much of her time exploring the nature of heaven, though paradoxically, her true idea of heaven is just to be alive and with her family and friends, be able to grow up and enjoy life.  She wants to follow lives of people she knew.  This is a tale of horror told without hate or bloody details.  On the contrary, it is full of love and humor.  Of cause, the narrator, Alyssa Bresnahan deserves the best possible marks.  Her performance is outstanding. <br />This is one of these books you cannot put down.  You know the end,but you want to get there at a slow pace and make sure that the end is the right one.  I think this book is one of the best books written in a long while.	2004-02-27

It is captivating and shocking at the same time.  Did I know all that before?  I guess I did.  Did I care?  I guess I did not.  And now I feel as I was shaken by a very powerful hand and my eyes have opened.  Ireland and the Irish blaim the British for all their troubles but they should blaim religion for that first.  Poverty, ignorance, alcoholism and the general misery should be all attributed to religion.  <br />This book is quite well composed and it transferres you to the real depth of the human tragedy.  Hunger, death, the numness...  Men say a lot of promising words but they cannot keep the jobs even if they have one.  Catholics, Protestants...  What the difference?  One drinks his wages away and another one take care of the family...  Is that the difference?  This book raised so many questions in my head.<br />Yes, I think we all should read it.  This is an important book.	2003-12-24

This is a very massive, very monumental work of the historical proportions.  If you like history, if you want to know what really happen, people involved, reaction of the world, relationships and why we live as we live, you have to read this book.

Yes, there is a plot and the characters, and the heroes but it all takes a secondary place to the history of civilization and religions.  Frankly, I was not thrilled by the plot but I did not care.  Plot was just the background for the real story. I knew bits and pieces of what Dan Brown presented in the book but I have never saw this information so well put together.  How did he do it?  He made no mistakes in his information and the assesments of it and the real history supports it.<br />Yes, all religions are full of questionable wholes.  You read the \\"Holy\\" books and you have problems to digest them.  But when you ask a question, the answer would take you back to the mystery of God.  Why is the mystery?  Was there an explanation?  If it could be explained, why was not it?  If it could not be explained, did it really happen as we were told?<br />Yes, all religions, over the years, were \\"cleaned up\\" and \\"adjusted\\" in accordance with the specific situation, culture, historical events, the local customs and the desires of the rulling class.  God always helped to rule.  God always help the rullers to keep the rulled under control.  No, God had nothing to do with any of the \\"Holly\\" books.  People wrote them, people compiled them and people enforced them.  How many people died a violent death because of these books and because of these intrapretations of what God said and what God meant and how we should serve him.  Or, is it her?<br />Dan Brown collected the wealth of information and he presented it extremely well.  Read it and think of what it said or did not say.  Thank you Mr. Brown.	2003-09-27

All of his previous works had an extremely interesting plot, well developed charachters and it was delivered in an easy form of a friend telling the story.  I always enjoyed very much but it was not great.  This time it was different.  <br />This was not a story of the legal process in our country and the loopholes used to win the case.  It was not a story of a crime and punishment where the attorney was a hero.  This was a story of the simple people struggling to survive in the hardland of America during the Korean war era.  And the whole story is told by a little boy, who does not know much but who can feel and maybe better than the others.<br />When I was reading &quot;A Paineted House&quot; I was thinking of the best American writers and the struggle to creat the great American novel.  I think this is the best work of John Grisham and it should be within the classics.	2003-06-01

She is a good writer and a great detective.  But what is really amaizing that I was able to understand all the professional information packed so tightly in to her books.  Patricia made it simple to understand and to follow.<br />Now this book is something different.  We are talking about one of the classic cases which was never solved and which happend so long ago.  Patricia was able to take it a part and to come up with a result.  We can argue whether her conclutions are right or wrong but what difference does it make for a book?  She convinced me and even that is not important.  She presented a case where everything was lost and nothing is solid.  There are only little pieces of information and a few clues and she logically put them together.  I loved it.  What is next, Patricia?	2003-05-31

The first time I read it, I was about 17 years old living in Russia.  Anything American was good.  The book was translated into Russian but somehow was not very popular.  No one could really understand what it was all about.  If it was about the WWII, it was at least strange.  If it was an American humor, there was nothing to laugh about.  It was not funny to bomb your own planes.  And how could a captain walk around naked?  Tomatoes, prostitutes, the CID men, crazy officers and nurses... People did not like it.<BR>Than I came to America and a few years later, I saw this book used, somewhere, and just for 10 cents.  I could not resist.  I read it again.  I could speak some English back than but I guess it was not enough to understand the full depth of Catch-22.  I liked it better than before, in Russia, but still not enough.  It was just OK.<BR>A month ago, I was making more room for books in my house.  Books, I did not care much about were destined to end their lives in the local library, as my donation.  Catch-22 by Joseph Heller...  I opened it again.  What a mistake.  What a surprise.  I was stunned.  It was one of the best books ever written.  One has to know not only the language but the life in America and the Americans as well to understand this book completely.  This book is not about the war.  This book is about us and our lives and our regular affairs.  This book is perfect and has to be an American classic.  No, Catch-22 did not go to the local library.  It is destined now to end its life on my shelf.  I will have to read it again and, only than, again and again.  Have you read it?  You have to read it.	2003-05-09

A few weeks ago I finished reading the \\"Dawn of the Transcendence\\" by D. Mikles.  Than I set there for a long while quietly, hard swallowing my coffee and trying to switch my brain in to another gear.  But my thoughts kept coming back to the book I just read.  It was not a book overly large and full of great thoughts and ideas capable to generate such a reaction from me.  It was just some hundred and fifty pages novel.  I read a few books before and I heard a few thoughts as well.  What could be new?  Why was I so deep in my thoughts after reading this one?  Was it because the thoughts of the author expressed in the book matched mine?  Was it because of the sharpness of the language or the clearness of the thoughts?  Was it because the world we are living in was dissected with such a surgical precision of not only a good writer but a responsible human been, who cares?  Was it because I care as well? <br />Did I like it?  I cannot answer this question.  This is not a book for liking or disliking.  This book is one of those I keep close.  I open them quite often just to read a few passages, just to make sure that there are other people with a beating heart.  Sometimes I am not certain that there are any left.  Reading this book is a privilege and many of us earned it.  We earned the privilege to read good books and to hear words of the people with heart.  You will understand me when you read it yourself.  Ask D. Mikles your questions and find the answers in the book.  All answers are in there.  \\"Dawn of the Transcendence\\" is a rare gem.  I value it as I value Mr. D. Mikles.	2003-02-10

I have not read the first one yet.  Well, give time and I will.  <br />I slowly opened it up and three pages later I knew it was not a book just for reading.  It was a thinking book.  Any regular book works as a monologue.  The author talks to you through the book.  He tells you what he thinks about and you don't get to respond.  You cannot agree or disagree.  This book was different.  This book was a dialogue.  Questions were asked and answers were given.

If he wrote this book, how come he does not know anything about anything any longer.  He used to be knowledgeable and informative.  He used to know things.  There is no knowledge in this book, just useless words.  The &quot;Rabbit&quot; takes off to Hungary with the family and escapes.  Are you nuts?  If that was possible, a half of the Soviet Union would have escaped.  The KGB officers were not allowed to travel overseas unless on buseness.  Families of the KGB officers were held as hostages.  It took months and not two days to get approvals to travel overseas.  There were no travel agencies.  There were no international ruble and no one was obligated to take rubles.  Rubles were useless even in Socialist countries.  One had to exchange currency in Russia prior to traveling and only one hundred rubles per person was allowed.  The rest of it was the black market.  I can go forever with the list of the wrong information in this book.  Almost everything is wrong in this book.  And, therefore, the whole plot does not work.  It is very disappointing.

I think it was published even before the Schindler's list became widely known.  This is the story of the condammed Jews in the Polish ghetto trying to fight back without any help from the outside and not for the survival (it was impossible and they knew it) but for the remains of dignity and for the right to die standing tall.  Mila 18 by Leon Uris comes to mind when you read \\"The Wall\\".	2002-09-22

How could a writer, not a historian, put together a novel (I would not call it a historical novel) full of adventure, love, and knowledge?

I wanted to understand if this book was as close to the truth as possible and how should I relay it to \\"Exodus\\".  So, I taked to people, who's opinion I value, discussing the book and the truth, and I checked the facts.  The truth was that Jews did not force the Palestinians to leave, other Arabs did, Jordanian legion did.  The Islam leaders did it.  \\"Haj\\" presents it very well, and it is still in a miled form.  The truth was even uglier than that.  So, if you really on the market for truth, if you want to understand the tragedy of the Middle East, read \\"Exodus\\" and \\"Haj\\" by Leon Uris.	2002-09-18

Poland is a country, which happened to be right in between the East and the West of Europe. Every conflict in Europe left its heavy foot in Poland killing people and destroying the country. Poles suffered more than any other nation in the world, short of the Jews. I was in Poland for a few times. It is amazing how they were able to rebuild Warsaw after the W.W.II. Warsaw did not exist after the war, only three percent of the city remained standing and look at it now. Good book, interesting history.	2002-09-18
