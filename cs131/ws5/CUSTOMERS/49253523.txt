Since I liked the first book, it was not difficult for me to try reading this one. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this book is a pure gem. One can learn about people personalities, the laws of behavior and many other psychology tricks.  Learn when someone is trying ot negotiate with you vs. when you are being manipulated.

This book is the only one - I was able to find - that will teach you how to do affirmations properly.  Illustrations on the book are beautiful.  And the book itself is so small one can carry it in the purse, or a pocket.  I was pleasantly suprised to find out that book had a CD in it.  So, if you just feel like listening to Ms. Hay's pleasant voice you can just do that and still find it calming and fulfilling.  You will look at your life differently.  Once I finished the book, I went ahead and bought Louise Hay's \\"Wisdom Cards\\".  I just like the way she explains things and the way she teaches we should live our life.	2005-07-13

I never knew what hypnosis is all about - legitimate way of accessing subconscious, or hocus pokus.  So, I set out on learning more about it by exploring the topic.  This particular book was unique in a way that it explains what the hypnosis is and what state a person is in when hypnotized.  What was a pleasant surprise was a fact that many shortcomings we all have: fear, lack of self confidence, desire to loose weight and many other topics can actually be conquered by using hypnisis and meditation methods as described in the book.  In short, book will explain to you psychological reasons for certain experiences we all have and the alternative ways of correcting the undesired qualities, or enhancing the qualities we wish to enhance.  You will learn in this book how to attract good things in one's life such as: health and happiness, - or how to love oneself first, so that you can love the people around you.  Well written.  Interesting read for open minded.	2005-05-05

There are a couple of typing errors in the book too.  The writing is poor.

It was delight to find out that this talented writer is both scientist and a poet, cosmopolitan in cast of characaters she introduces in her stories - as well as wonderful places around the world used for staging some of her stories.  Her characters are complex and vulnerable.  Some of the stories are connected, so in some ways the book feels like a sort of novella, too.  After reading it I had a feeling that this book is strongly personal for Ms. Mazur and that it has its strength in the possibility of being semi-autobiography mixed with dash of fiction.	2002-06-11

As a reader of the contemporary Eastern European writers, I could not pass it, although I have not heard of the author, Ludmilla Petrushevskaya before.  And what a gem I have found!  The book is extensive selection of the short stories set in contemporary Russia.  The characters are so real that even the shortest story makes one stop for the moment and reflect on it.  The editors are comparing Ms. Petrushevskaya with contemporary Chekov and they are so right.  This is a must have in the personal library and it stands in it's own right next to my selection of works of Nabokov, Klima, Milos and Ugresic.

So when I saw the book written by Greenwald himself, I could not resist but test his writing again.  If you are looking for the enlightments or truly literary achievement, do not waste your time.  This book will not give you that.  However, if you are looking into exploring in 200 pages or less adventures of California man in search of perfect Buddha statue in Nepal, then go for it.  The book will give you another perspective of expatriates abroad who are trying to make ends meet, but at the same time are genuinely drawn to the mysticism of the Far East.  Mr. Greenwald is not pretending to be the one who will bring Buddhism closer to Western world's.  Rather, in his own way he brings us to HIS story of the way(s) of finding perfect Buddha statue.

If it is a choice, in many instances, it is tough choice to make.  If the childlessness is a result of the circumstance(s), any woman may find it difficult at times to rationalize the outcome.  But this is what makes it difficult about accepting the book completely.  It is not the always woman who decides not to have children of her own.  There is some, but not enough discussion in the book about the man who makes decision not to have children of his own.  The extensive research by Ms. Lisle, which is quite remarkable, does not go deep into men's choices or circumstances about not having children.  I only wish that both sexes were researched equally for this purpose.  However, overall, this topic and  the book is valuable support for anyone out there trying to assert themselves and resassure themselves, that there is nothing abnornal about making these choices and that after all, there are people out there across all continents, social backgrounds and professional backgrounds who feel quite comforable accepting the idea that they either do not wish to have children of their own, or can live quite hapily without children regardless of the reasons for not having them.	2001-04-16

The young woman's personal problems stay in the way of her leading normal and responsible life.  The two opposite worlds collapse as it becomes obvious that one clerical error leads to the chain of events that one cannot expect at all.  Written from two perspectives (immigrant's and young woman's) this story is compelling from start to finish.  And even though it is obvious that there will be not winners in this story, that will not stop any reader to finish the book.  The end of this story is totally, totally unpredictable.	2001-03-21

Knowing that my husband would probably not read the book by his choice (book about four women and their daugthters, was not quite a good pitch), I rented a movie and had him see it.  After seeing the movie which keeps very close to the plot in the book, my husband was finally ready to read the book himself.

The main character, who normally reads only &quot;funnies&quot; form the daily paper, uses unexpectedly word such as inconspicuous, while at the same time using word curiouser?!  Also, what annoyed me is that her best friend, the cop and friend married to her cousin, has &quot;eastern Slavic&quot; features, like there are &quot;western Slavic&quot; features, only we did not know about them?

It would have been my first trip to Asia.  I was excited, scared and anxious at the same time.  A business woman all alone in Hong Kong for a month?  I had to learn about the place.  So I came across this book in my local library and it was a gem!  Book contains first hand experience stories written by western travelers visiting Hong Kong.  Some were there for the first time, some had ancestors there, some were expatriots.  But each and every story had unique voice and each and every one was wonderful account of the experiences one can expect to have while visiting this place of magic.  I enjoyed the book because it had really funny stories, that would make you giggle.  So one had to be careful not to read them in public because the occasional laugh would cause heads turn.  However, I understood the culture, customs and people so well, that I got attached to Hong Kong more than I ever thought it possible.  It was hearthbreking coming home.  I know I will have to go there again.  Soon.  Business or otherwise.  And then - I will carry with me my own copy of the Travelers Tales.  It is one of the kind traveler's book.

I have learned about this writer and his first published book by reading  the &quot;Books&quot; section of the Chicago Tribune.  One can count on  their fingers contemporary writers from Eastern Europe whose work is  recongized here: Danilo Kis, Milorad Pavic, Dubravka Ugresic, Slavenka  Drakulic to name a few.  However, the works of Aleksandar Hemon stand out.  This is the first (slavic) writer who actually wrote his works in his  second language (english). It took a lot of courage to do so.  And do not  think that this book will be some sort of exploitation on the theme of the  civil war in former Yugoslavia.  It is a complex collection of the stories  which all have something in common between them.  Written by the writer  from Bosnia who is not Muslim, or Croat, or Serb, but rather tries to  separate his own nationality by calling himself Bosnian of the Ukranian  descent.  The stories will take you not only thru his experience in Bosnia  but also one learns about (Eastern European)immigrant life in Chicago.  Mr.  Hemon's stories can be heavy at times and he knows just the right moment to  add some comic element in it that will lift reader up. In either case,  these are provocative stories that will make you think about them, long  after you finished reading the book.  I am hoping to see more work from  this talented writer in the near future.	2000-08-28

The fact that the book already was a bestseller was not  important to me.  As I started reading, I was pleased to be able to refresh  my memory about world's most famous philosophers and the influence they had  on our world today.  But at the same time, I was disappointed with the  literary flows of Mr. Gaardner's ambitious 500+ pages work.  This book is  definitely lacking beauty of the written word and I am not sure if I am to  blame it's writer or the translation for it.  As much as I was glad that  Mr. Gaardner brough philosophy to the mass, who sometimes has hard time  understanding it, I was also let down by the lame plot of the  &quot;mystery&quot; of the story.	2000-08-03
