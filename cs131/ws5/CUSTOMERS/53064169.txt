The suitcase nukes, which are hard to maintain, have  supposedly been made ready for use by rogue Russian and Pakistani scientists. Worse yet, claims Williams, these weapons have already been deployed to Al Qaeda terrorist cells in several major cities in the United States, ready for an \\"American Hiroshima\\" that will kill upwards of 4 million Americans and devastate the world's economy.<br /><br />Williams' claims are sensational, and they must be taken with a large grain of salt.  His chapter notes show that Williams relied on newspaper articles, internet sources and rumor rather than privileged access to military intelligence.  And the proposition that nuclear weapons are in the hands of Islamists begs a couple of key questions: why haven't they been used against the Russians, who have many mortal enemies in Chechnya?  For that matter. why haven't they already been detonated in America, Europe, Iraq or Afghanistan?<br /><br />Williams hints at some possible answers.  Perhaps Al Qaeda has the weapons, but they are unreliable and difficult to maintain.  Perhas bin Laden is just waiting for the right anniversary date--say, an October 7 (the start of the war in Afghanistan), or a January 15 (the start of the First Gulf War), or even a November 27 (the anniversary of Pope Urban's call for crusade in 1095).  Above all, Williams argues, bin Laden and al Qaeda are patient--the fact that a nuclear weapon hasn't gone off yet is no comfort that al Qaeda isn't working hard to make it happen.<br /><br />Another possibility is that al Qaeda understands that the nuclear destruction of one or more American cities could very easily lead to a savage retaliation by the United States.  Even bin Laden may be unwilling to pick the ultimate fight with an adversary that is equipped with a large arsenal of thermonuclear warheads.  In the face of an \\"American Hiroshima,\\" I suspect that the American public and its leaders would be very hard to restrain, and that possibility may give pause even to a fanatic.<br /><br />Still, the threat of nuclear terrorism is so dangerous that it has to be taken seriously.  Imagine a single nuclear weapon exploding in Long Beach, which handles a huge proportion of the imports coming into the United States--apart from the tragic and enormous loss of life, the world economy (not just America's) would be plunged into a depression overnight.<br /><br />For a more plausible but equally disturbing take on the nuclear threat, read Graham Allison's \\"Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.\\"  Allison's argument is that the real nuclear threat comes from unprotected stockpiles of enriched uranium 235 in the former Soviet Union.  The Bush Administration has drastically cut the funding for programs that were intended to secure these stockpiles, and Allison makes a very cogent argument that the war in Iraq has distracted the United States from the critical task of keeping Russian uranium out of the hands of terrorists.  If a nuclear weapon does explode in the US, it may very well be a U-235 fission device (like the bomb dropped on Hiroshima) delivered by containership to a major port (Long Beach, New Orleans, Houston, Boston, or New York).  Remember, U-235 weapons are so well understood and reliable that the one dropped on Hiroshima was not even tested--it was the much trickier plutonium implosion bomb that was the subject of the famous July 1945 test at Alamagordo.  In 1945, the problem with a U-235 bomb was that it took an entire year to make enough enriched uranium for just one bomb--the Russians have solved that problem for al Qaeda and have left tons of material in scores of poorly proected sites.<br /><br />And just in case you sleep well at night thinking that the Department of Homeland Security will be able to protect us from this nuclear threat and its aftermath--well, just consider the Bush Administration's recent performance in the face of Hurricane Katrina.h Administration's recent performance in the face of Hurricane Katrina.	2005-09-25

The focus is not on royalty or battles (which are usually mentioned only in passing) but on the homes that people lived in, what they ate, how they farmed, who they married, what they believed in, how they celebrated and how their lives were changed during the great \\"ages\\" of British history. The settings include the end of the last ice age and the resulting formation of the English Channel, the prehistoric settlement of the British Isles, the Roman conquest, the Dark Ages, the Norman conquest, the Black Death and its aftermath, the Reformation and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />The book includes many interesting tidbits that make history come alive for the reader. Pollard explains, for example, that the difference between the Anglo-Saxon words \\"pig\\" and \\"cow\\" and the Norman French words \\"pork\\" and \\"beef\\" represents the gulf between conquered and conqueror. The Anglo-Saxons worked their farms for the benefit of the Normans, so we inherited their words for living animals; the Normans enjoyed the produce of their Anglo-Saxon tenants, and so we retained their words for the animals' meat. The observation is illuminating, and it provides a useful bit of trivia for conversation over cocktails.<br /><br />If you enjoy Pollard's book, you might want to consider a few other works that stress the history and experiences of the common people, including Lacey and Danziger's \\"The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium\\"; Danziger & Gillingham's \\"1215: The Year of Magna Carta\\"; and Julian Richards' \\"Meet the Ancestors: Unearthing the Evidence that Brings us Face to Face with the Past.\\"	2005-09-25

Each essay is well written and describes an important event (a birth or a death, a battle or the passage of a law) and then explains what flowed from or caused the event.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed this book. Each morning over breakfast, I read the entries for the day and learn a little bit more about history. The subject changes constantly, so it's never boring, and I can always leap ahead to see what happened on my birthday, or my wife's birthday, or our anniversary or whatever.<br /><br />Although there are several other works that are similar to \\"365,\\" I think this one is the best of the bunch. Still, in case you want to have something similar on hand when you finish with \\"365,\\" you might consider these entries, all of which are more lightweight than \\"365\\" (but still entertaining): Whitely, \\"On This Date . . .\\" (2002); Spinrad, Sprinrad, Miller & Brown, \\"On This Day in History\\" (1999); Miller & Brown, \\"More on This Day in History\\" (2002); Donaldson & Donaldson, \\"The Book of Days\\" (1979) (eccentric and quirky); and Patterson, \\"What Time of Day Was That: History by the Minute\\" (2001).<br /><br />For a more encylopedic but less readable approach to the subject, try The History Channel's \\"Today in History: A Day by Day Review of World Events\\"--this book has a lot more entries than \\"365,\\" but it lacks Marsh and Carrick's elegant essays.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"365\\" as a thoroughly enjoyable way of boning up on history.	2005-09-21

According to this narrative, Attila married a Germanic princess, Ildico, enjoyed a wild night of drunken revelry, and retired to his bed with his new bride.  The next day, his guards found him dead with Ildico weeping by his side--he had evidently drowned from a nosebleed during his drunken stupor.<br /><br />Not a very flattering ending for the Scourge of God--and that, according to Babcock, is exactly the point.  The author uses his skills as a philologist to explore the ancient texts and what they have to say about Attila's life and, ultimately, his death.  It turns out there is a fair amount of evidence to suggest that Jordanes wasn't telling the truth.  Babcock theorizes that Attila was murdered, possibly in revenge for the death of Bleda (the Hun's elder brother) and almost certainly with the complicity of the eastern and western Roman empires.  And once Attila was gotten rid of, the historians and their powerful patrons conspired to make sure that his death would be remembered as a humiliating one, the better to discourage those who would attack the divinely protected Roman world.<br /><br />The conclusion that Attila was murdered is not all that surprising--he was a violent man in a violent time, and the traditional story of his demise sounds too much like a fable with a moral attached.  After all, if you're a powerful, warlike Hun, what could be worse than to die in the comfort of your bed rather than on the battlefield?<br /><br />But it doesn't matter whether you ultimately agree with Babcock that Attila was murdered--what's enjoyable about \\"The Night Attila Died\\" is the journey through ancient texts and Wagnerian operas, through half-remembered legends and and the detritus of time.  From the standpoint of his prospective victims, the method of Attila's death was less important than the critical fact that \\"Attila died.\\"  For the rest of us, there's an intriguing murder mystery here with lots of clues--shifty suspects, questionable motives, lots of people with opportunity, and plenty of self-serving testimony.  Attila's death was and is a great story, and Babcock has done a nice job of telling it.<br /><br />For further reading about the Huns and their depradations, consider Patrick Howarth's \\"Attila, King of the Huns: The Man and the Myth\\" (short and readable) and Hugh Kennedy's \\"Mongols, Huns and Vikings,\\" which does a great job of explaining why nomads like the Huns were such effective warriors--and how and why civilized societies were ultimately able to defeat them.e critical fact that \\"Attila died.\\"  For the rest of us, there's an intriguing murder mystery here with lots of clues--shifty suspects, questionable motives, lots of people with opportunity, and plenty of self-serving testimony.

This was a classic naval engagement fought between large wooden ships firing broadsides and sailing in line-ahead formation on the open sea.<br /><br />The rest of the book is devoted to more thorough explorations of five other important battles (thus the subtitle), each of which is explored in detail:<br /><br />The first is the Battle of Lake Erie, in which the Americans under Oliver Hazard Perry built a small sailing fleet and used it to defeat an equally small British force.  The victory enabled America to hold on to the Old Northwest territories in the War of 1812 and ultimately to begin expanding westward without British interference.  Though the battle was small and the scene was a lake (albeit a great one), the tactics and equipment used were basically similar to those used in the Battle of the Capes.<br /><br />The Battle of Hampton Roads covers the slugfest between the ironclads Virginia and Monitor.  Before the Monitor arrived on the scene, the ironclad CSS Virgnia had inflicted on the Union fleet at Hampton Roads the largest defeat experienced by the American navy before Pearl Harbor.  The guns involved were much more advanced than those used in the Battle of Lake Erie and each ship moved under its own power, but the battle was still fought at close quarters where each combatant had a fairly good view of the other.<br /><br />The Battle of Manila Bay represents the next phase in naval warfare: cruisers with long range guns bombarded each other at ranges of up to two miles, leading to suprisingly few (but devastating) hits on the Spanish squadron in the Philippines. Admiral Dewey quickly asserted control over the Philippines, and the United States was soon bogged down in a four-year long fight against Filipinos seeking independence.<br /><br />The Battle of Midway represents the next iteration in naval warfare, when a decisive American victory was won by carrier planes launched by ships separated by distances of hundreds of miles.<br /><br />Finally, Symonds describes Operation Praying Mantis, the 1989 battle between the American navy and Iranian forces that resulted in the destruction of several Iranian gas and oil separation platforms, the sinking of two Iranian frigates, and the near-sinking of a third.  The damage was inflicted by American warships firing guns and long-range missiles while coordinating with similarly equipped aircraft and helicopters.<br /><br />Symonds' writing style is crisp, and his description of each battle is gripping and insightful.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a succinct overview of the evolution of naval warfare over the last two hundred years.hilippines, and the United States was soon bogged down in a four-year long fight against Filipinos seeking independence.

Superheated water flashed to steam, and an enormous explosion roared out behind the crumbling slope.  Within a few minutes, the mountain had lost 1,300 feet of its height, thousands of acres were devastated and 57 people were dead.<br /><br />\\"Echoes of Fury\\" traces the lives of eight people who were caught up in the eruption and its aftermath: Don Swanson, a geologist who had persuaded a colleague to take his place at an observation post near the volcano; Roald Reitan and Venus Dergan, two lovers trapped in a mudflow; Donna Parker, whose brother was killed even though he was camped well outside the official danger zone; Andre Stepankowsky, a reporter who helped the Longview Daily News win a Pulitzer for its reporting about the eruption and its aftermath; Peter Frenzen, a graduate student who became the official monument scientist; Robert Rogers, a young daredevil who repeatedly risked his life to explore and photograph the erupting volcano; and Jim Scymanky, a logger whose crew was caught by the volcano's blast.<br /><br />Parchman's book appears just in time for the 25th anniversary of Mt St Helen's eruption, and it is well worth reading.  After briefly telling the story of the volcano's return to life in March 1980, Parchman quickly plunges into the story, describing the eruption and the terrifying events experienced by Scymanky, Reitan, Dergan and Rogers.  After explaining what happened on that Sunday morning in 1980, Parchman covers the aftermath--the ash that blanketed eastern Washington, turning day into night; the mudflows that choked the Columbia River and threatened the cities of Kelso and Longview with catastrophic flooding; the lawsuit against the State of Washington and Weyerhaeuser; the devastation of the landscape; the rebirth of the mountain; and the lives forever changed by the loss of loved ones.<br /><br />This is a gripping story, well told.

I picked the book up on a whim and soon found that DeGroot's style kept me turning the pages.<br /><br />DeGroot's book is a fairly high level overview of the development of the atomic bomb and its even more horrific successor, the hydrogen bomb.  It also explores the challenges of integrating these earthshaking weapons into military and political doctrine, with a special emphasis on the formative period of the 1950s and early sixties.<br /><br />But \\"The Bomb\\" is more than just a military or geopolitical history.  Degroot gives equal time to domestic developments provoked by the Bomb, such as disarmament movements, the grim fate of \\"downwinders,\\" and artifacts of bomb-driven cultural history like Bert the Turtle, \\"Dr. Stangelove,\\" Doomtown, \\"The Day After,\\" and the Doomsday Clock.  In fact, one of the most interesting aspects of the book is its description of the interplay between nuclear weapons and society--how the bomb changed culture, and how culture responded by changing the bomb.<br /><br />DeGroot is an equal opportunity critic, and he muses about both the excesses of nuclear warriors and the quixotic struggles of those who pressed for disarmament.  In the end, he demurs--\\"a final verdict on the Bomb is impossible.\\"<br /><br />If you are looking for a readable overview of the development and cultural impact of nuclear weapons, \\"The Bomb: A Life\\" is a good and sobering place to start.	2005-04-16

As their starting point, the authors describe the Klamath Tribe's myth of a great battle betwen the Chief of the Above World and the Chief of the Below World, a legend that had been handed down for hundreds of generations and that accurately describes the eruption of Mount Mazama (now Crater Lake)--a cataclysm that took place nearly 8,000 years ago!<br /><br />It turns out that many famous \\"monsters\\" of history were not really monsters at all--the stories of Medusa and the Gorgons, of Cyclops, of the battle between the gods and the Titans, may have started out as descriptions of devastating volcanic eruptions.  The \\"message in the myth\\" may have originally been something along the lines of \\"stay away from Mount Gorgon--her hair of snakes (treacherous lava flows) can turn things to stone!\\"  Over the years, as people migrated away from the volcano that gave rise to the myth, the mountain turned into an anthropomorphic monster with a bad hairdo and the power to turn her hapless victims into statues.<br /><br />Time and again, the authors remind us that there may be deep messages encoded in the myths--ancient societies observed and understood the precession of the equinoxes (a cycle that takes nearly 26,000 years to complete), and many of the ancient myths about gods casting down monsters and the cycles of history can be explained by reference to this predictable (but hard to observe) change in the heavens.<br /><br />\\"When They Severed Earth from Sky\\" is well-written, lively and thought-provoking.  It makes me wonder whether someday anthropologists will be able to use the principles that the Barbers described to tease out and recover the \\"ur-myths\\" that underlay the seemingly impenetrable symbolism of prehistoric peoples.  Perhaps not--some things are no doubt lost forever in the mists of time.

Michael Balter began thinking about Catalhoyuk when Science magazine assigned him to write a story about the excavations back in 1998.  He became fascinated by the subject, found reasons to go back to the dig to write follow up articles, and eventually became the excavation's official biographer.<br /><br />The story begins with James Mellaart's discovery of the mound at Catalhoyuk and the stunning realization that it was Neolithic (New Stone Age) from top to bottom--to use Mellaart's phrase, no \\"filthy Roman muck\\" cluttered this site.  Balter describes the excavation of the site in the 1960s, the excitement about the discovery of \\"Goddess\\" figurines, Mellaart's expulsion from Turkey in the aftermath of the mysterious Dorak Affair, and the long hiatus between Mellaart's departure in 1965 and the arrival of Ian Hodding's team in 1993.  The narrative offers many insights about the debates among \\"processual\\" and \\"post-processual\\" archaeologists, as well as the backgrounds of the many interesting people who choose to live and dig at Catalhoyuk year after year.<br /><br />But the stars of the book are Catalhoyuk and its people.  What do we know about these villagers, those generations that occupied the site for nearly 1,000 years?  Did they worship bulls or goddesses?  Were their cattle domesticated or wild or something in between?  Why did they bury their dead beneath the floors of their houses?  Why did they bury and sometimes burn their houses, only to build new structures on top of the old, over and over again? And why did they choose to live together in such large numbers in the middle of what was then a marsh?<br /><br />There may never be any final answer to any of these questions, or to the myriad of other questions raised by Catalhoyuk and other Neolithic sites.  Still, half the pleasure is in the journey, and Balter has done an excellent job of describing a journey that is truly marvelous.	2005-01-03

Friedman writes clearly and forcefully about the real reasons why America invaded Iraq and the role that the invasion plays in the War on Terror.<br /><br />Friedman begins his narrative with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, a nightmare development that threatened to give the Soviets control of the Persian Gulf and to lead to America's expulsion from the Middle East.  The Carter Administration recognized the strategic threat and began moving quickly to assemble an Islamist guerrilla force to bog down the Soviets in their own Vietnam.  The US strategy was intensified by the Reagan Administration and ultimately proved successful, but it had the side effect of convincing the Islamists that they could, if they fought hard enough, topple a superpower.  The presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War did much to enrage the Islamists, convincing them that their best chance of re-establishing an Islamic caliphate lay in provoking a war with the United States.<br /><br />Friedman's book explores the Byzantine details of American and Islamist Realpolitik in a fairly balanced way.  He argues that the invasion of Iraq was not about WMDs or connections to Al Qaeda or even about oil, but was intended to show the Islamic world (and particularly Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) that the United States meant business and that those who didn't get with the program were going to be dealt with very harshly. The fact that the United States has substantial ground and air forces within easy striking distance of Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia, among others, has no doubt been noticed by the leaders of those countries, dampening their enthusiasm for tolerating Al Qaeda.<br /><br />The details of this Realpolitik are not pretty.  To facilitate the invasion of Afghanistan, the United States obtained Russia's permission to base troops in the Islamic states of the former Soviet Union--in exchange for which, America agreed to mute its criticism of Russia's excesses in Chechnya.  After Islamist terrorists attacked the Indian parliament in New Delhi, America secured Pakistan's reluctant cooperation in the War on Terror by making it clear that the United States wouldn't mind very much if India launched a nuclear attack on Pakistan (if America didn't launch one first).  The book contains numerous other examples of why America, Iran and other countries behave in ways that are portrayed in the newspapers as peculiar, but are actually quite understandable when taken in context.<br /><br />Although I think it is fair to say that Friedman is sympathetic with the Bush Administration's approach, he is not an apologist.  He documents numerous strategic, tactical and intelligence failures in Iraq, not the least of which was the Administration's failure to appreciate the control that Iran exercised over Iraq's Shi'ite population.  He is properly critical of the separation between the American political leadership and the soldiers: \\"A ruling class that sends the children of others to fight, but not their own, cannot sustain its power for very long\\" (339).  And he concludes that, although the United States has the upper hand in the War on Terror, \\"the war now hangs in the balance.  It is not clear who will win the war.  Neither side is defeated.  Neither side can give up.\\"  This is a balanced and sobering book, a must-read for anyone interested in what is really going on in the War on Terror.in exchange for which, America agreed to mute its criticism of Russia's excesses in Chechnya.

US	53064169	R5X06KFGHIVDM	0233050833	14646975	Battlefield Detectives	Books	5	7	7	N	N	The Fog of War	Everyone who is interested in military history has read about Hastings, Agincourt and Little Bighorn and has some idea of what happened at each of those battles.  But what if the history books are wrong, or at least a bit off?  What if the key elements of these and other battles are actually different from what we've come to believe?<br /><br />Wason explores the myths and realities about several major battles, looking at each with the aid of modern archaeology, psychology, meteorology and other disciplines.  Among the topics explored:<br /><br />What were the management styles of William the Conqueror and King Harold, and how does that help to explain who won at the Battle of Hastings?<br /><br />Was Agincourt really decided by the vaunted long bow, or did the English victory have more to do with crowd dynamics and the viscosity of French mud?<br /><br />Was the Spanish Armada lost because the fleet's navigators mis-judged its position by hundred of miles?  What role did English guns and ship design play in the outcome?<br /><br />Was Marshal Ney fit for command on the day of Waterloo, or did combat fatigue put an end to The Hundred Days?<br /><br />Did Custer's batallion fight a disciplined \\"last stand\\" against an overwhelming force of Native Americans, or was it quickly routed by a healthier, better-equipped foe?<br /><br />\\"Battlefield Detectives\\" offers an interesting exploration of these and other engagements, including Balaklava and Gallipoli.  All in all, a well written and enjoyable critique of the myths surrounding these famous struggles.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about what modern science can tell us about old battles, consider reading Hugh Miller's \\"More Secrets of the Dead\\" (which provides an interesting perspective on the Battle of Isandlawana), the \\"Two Men in a Trench\\" series, and \\"The Battle that Stopped Rome\\" (about the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest).	2004-09-25

In just a few moments, Hood was blown up by shell fire from the Bismarck and the Prince of Wales was heavily damaged. Despite the wrenching loss of its flagship, the Royal Navy maintained its dogged pursuit of the Bismarck, fatally damaging and finally sinking her a few days later.<br /><br /> The chapters in Hood and Bismarck alternate between an historical description of the two ships and their battle and the assembly of a modern expedition to search for both of them. Bismarck had been located by Dr. Robert Ballard's team in 1989, but the location was kept secret; Hood remained lost in the cold waters of the North Atlantic.<br /><br /> The expedition lead by David Mearns successfully relocated the wreck of the Bismarck and then went on to find the shattered remains of the Hood. The description of how the wrecks were found makes very interesting reading, and the evidence gathered by the expedition offers some interesting perspectives on some old questions: why did the Hood explode and sink so quickly, and was the Bismarck scuttled by her crew or sunk by her opponents?<br /><br /> The book lacks the remarkable artist's conceptions of the &quot;shipwreck as a whole&quot; that are customary in Dr. Ballard's books (in particular, his &quot;The Discovery of the Bismarck&quot;, published in 1990). On the whole, however, Hood and Bismarck is very well-researched and written and the analysis and crisp photographs make up for the missing &quot;big picture&quot; paintings. Moreover, the book successfully captures the very human dimension of the struggle between the Royal Navy and the Kriegsmarine--the very few survivors of the Hood and the Bismarck play a moving role in the search for these sunken ships and in the laying of memorial plaques on their remains. Highly recommended!	2004-07-24

They tend to be extremely long and exquisitely detailed, which makes them hard to fit into a busy schedule.  And they sometimes emphasize high level German politics and World War II without explaining what is was like for an ordinary person to live through the twelve brutal years of the \\"Thousand Year Reich.\\"<br />\\"Insider Hitler's Germany\\", on the other hand, is a very approachable book that chronciles life in Germany after the Great War and during the Third Reich.  The authors write in a clear and informative style, letting the facts speak for themselves.<br />Most of us assume that totalitarian Germany must have been a nightmare for the German citizens who lived through it.  It certainly was for Germans who were Jewish or Communist or otherwise gave the slightest hint of being out of step with the Nazi Party.  But many Germans experienced the 1930s as a golden age of low unemployment, vacations for the average worker, and resurgent national pride.  For them, it was only the catastrophe of World War II that exposed the true horrors of Nazism.<br />The most striking feature of this book is the photography that it reproduces.  All of the photos are in black and white, but many are amazingly crisp and filled with a chilling immediacy.  One that really caught my attention was a photo of the Hauptstrasse in Heidelberg, which is now a pedestrian mall filled with the usual shops (including, of course, a McDonald's).  I have walked down that street many times.  The photo shows a procession of scholars from the university, but  all of the buildings along the street are festooned with flags displaying the swastika of the Nazi party.  The stunning contrast between then and now is sobering, and this photo (like the book as a whole) is a useful reminder that the abyss is often just a very short step away.	2004-06-12

In \\"Inside Hitler's Bunker,\\" he focuses on the last days of the Third Reich, beginning his narrative on April 16, 1945 as the Soviets open their final offensive against Berlin.  The book explores the surreal and miserable world of the \\"Fuhrer Bunker\\" under the Reich Chancellery, the fanatical resistance and eventual collapse of the German armies defending Berlin, Hitler's delusional attempts to command armies that had been wiped out, and the astonishing willingness of soldiers and civilians to obey his orders until the very end.<br />This is a highly readable and very powerful book, and the translator (Margot Bettauer Dembo) deserves high marks for the result.  I read the book avidly, and as soon as I was done my wife picked it up and did the same.<br />\\"Inside Hitler's Bunker\\" may be somewhat disappointing for those who have read a great deal about the Battle of Berlin or Hitler's last days (the book does not appear to break a great deal of new ground), but it will prove to be a gripping narrative for those who are new to the horrors of Berlin in 1945.  Part of the continuing fascination of this dark time is the challenge of trying to understand the incomprehensible: how could a madman like Hitler stay in control of Germany in the last weeks of April 1945, and why did so many Germans follow him as he dragged them into the final catastrophe?<br />The answer to those questions may lie in the 12 years of indoctrination that preceded those fateful days in 1945.  For a brief and readable perspective on this period (which has been thoroughly explored in numerous more massive tomes), you may want to try \\"Inside Hitler's Germany: Life Under the Third Reich\\" by Matthew Hughes and Chris Mann.	2004-05-30

The book is not a systematic, chronological history of the arena--rather, it offers an impression of what the contests would have been like at various points in the development of the Republic and the Empire.<br />The games started as sword fights between slaves at funeral ceremonies--sometimes to the death, sometimes not.  Over time, successful Romans undertook to display their wealth by producing increasingly elaborate spectacles.  The cost and complexity of the enterprise eventually became so great that the state became involved in staging the proceedings.<br />Baker describes (sometimes in upsetting detail) the different contests that a Roman could expect to see at the arena: battles between warriors armed with various types of weapons and armor, fights to the death between &quot;hunters&quot; and terrified animals, naval battles between fleets manned by doomed slaves, and brutal executions.  Occasionally, an Emperor would step into the arena to display his fighting prowess (or to indulge his taste for sadism)--of course, his guard always made sure that his opponents were armed with wooden swords and doomed to die at the Emperor's hand.<br />Baker's book culminates in a chapter called &quot;A Day at the Games.&quot;  The account is lurid and unsettling, and Baker brings home the terror and pain of the men, women and animals who died in the arena to the cheers of the crowd.<br />The cruelty of the games simply staggers the imagination, to say nothing of the fact that this went on for hundreds of years.  It makes you think that the term &quot;Roman civilization&quot; is a bit of an oxymoron.	2004-05-16

Still, two million years is an awful lot of ground to cover in 200 pages of well-spaced text, and &quot;Throwing Fire&quot; is more of a long essay than a ground-breaking synthesis like Jared Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel.&quot;<br />For my money, the first few chapters are the most interesting parts of the book.  Crosby does a good job of summarizing what scientists know about the ability of Australopithicenes and other ancient hominids to throw rocks and other projectiles, the first known appearance of javelins an astonishing 400,000 years ago, the use of fire to &quot;terraform&quot; the planet, and the possible role of the atlatl (spear thrower) in the great extinction of megafauna that took place in the Upper Paleolithic.  The chapters that deal with relatively recent historical developments--gunpowder, crossbows, trebuchets, artillery, missiles, and the like--cover a lot of familiar ground with a broad brush and do not offer as many intriguing observations as the first parts of the book.<br />If this subject interests you and you'd like to read a more elaborate history of weapons development (albiet without Crosby's excellent examination of prehistory), try Robert O'Connell's highly readable &quot;Soul of the Sword: An Illustrated History of Weaponry and Warfare from Prehistory to the Present.&quot;  If you are intrigued by Crosby's brief discussion of the counterweight trebuchet (an impressive if little known medieval siege weapon), have a look at Fisher &amp; Fisher, &quot;Mysteries of Lost Empires,&quot; which includes a chapter about a project to reconstruct a trebuchet (everyone needs a hobby, I guess, and this one can be used to knock down castle walls).	2004-05-02

Grinspoon is a planetologist first, and the best part of this book lies in the author's descriptions of Venus (which he has studied intensively in his own career), Mars, Europa and other moons and planets in our solar system.  Mars and Venus are probably but not certainly lifeless, but Europa--well, there's an interesting world, which may have a liquid ocean and life beneath a miles thick layer of ice.  Scientists think enough of the possibility that they crashed the aging Galileo space probe into Jupiter's atmosphere rather than run the risk that it might someoday collide with (and possibly contaminate) Europa.<br />The balance of &quot;Lonely Planets&quot; reviews the history of philosophical and scientific thinking about the prospect of life on other worlds, the conditions that might give rise to life, the prospect of intelligent life evolving on other worlds (or even on this one), and the means by which &quot;advanced&quot; civilizations might communicate with each other.<br />The questions raised are thought provoking.  Is life on Earth a unique phenomenon, or is it possible (likely?) that life also developed on other worlds?  Is all life (or at least the life in this part of the galaxy) related by virtue of accidental or intentional &quot;panspermia&quot;?  If life exists elsewhere, is it likely to be carbon-based, or will some other element do the trick?  Does life always evolve toward intelligence as we understand it, or does it usually remain simple and gooey?  If there are advanced civilizations on other worlds, why don't they call or write?  Are we not cute enough (or smart enough)?  Maybe other forms of intelligent life just aren't talkative--or if they are, we can't figure out how to communicate with them, or them with us (when was the last time you had a chat with a whale or dolphin?)  Are alien visitors already here, or are people just imagining things?<br />Grinspoon does a good job of illuminating these and other fascinating questions.  His style is conversational and friendly, which is not a bad trick for a rocket scientist.  On the whole, a good, approachable introduction to what may be the most important scientific question of our time.

His prose is clear and crisp, and he tells an engaging story in a way that kept drawing me back to his rather hefty \\"Air Power.\\"<br />Budiansky begins his book by explaining why the accomplishments of the Wright Brothers were so remarkable.  He then renders a detailed history of the military uses, both real and imagined, of aircraft. The result is a story of a rapidly emerging technology told against the background of the military theories of the 20th and early 21st century.<br />Throughout his book, Budiansky takes issue with the views of theorists and generals who claimed that air power could be a \\"war-winning\\" weapon, either because it could be used to terrorize civilian populations into surrender or because it could cause rapid economic collapse by striking at the chokepoints in an enemy's supply system. The author argues that, with very few exceptions (such as the interdiction of German oil supplies in the last year of World War II), air power has not performed very well as a strategic tool and has always been far more effective when used as a tactical weapon in support of forces on the ground. In this sense, the Second Gulf War in Iraq can be viewed as the apotheosis of the effective use of air power: with the advent of readily available precision weapons, even \\"strategic\\" aircraft such as the B-1, B-2 and B-52 bombers have been used to great advantage in the role of close support of ground troops.<br />In the aftermath of the opening phases of the Second Gulf War, air power is for the moment ascendant on the battle field. But if there is anything to be learned from Budiansky's meticulous history, it is that military innovation is a very Darwinian business. Plenty of bright people are studying the successful American and British invasion of Iraq, trying to make sure that the air power strategy used in that conflict will work just as well in the next war--or, for those worried about being on the receiving end, trying to prevent that strategy from working at all.itish invasion of Iraq, trying to make sure that the air power strategy used in that conflict will work just as well in the next war--or, for those worried about being on the receiving end, trying to prevent that strategy from working at all.	2004-04-13

The book explores five historical mysteries, each of which was addressed in a one hour episode of the television series:<br />1. Why did the citizens of Jamestown, England's first permanent American colony, die at such an alarming rate? Were their deaths the result of starvation, disease or mass murder?<br />2. Did the Phoenicians and their Carthaginian descendants really sacrifice their children, or was that claim just a slander spread by the Greeks and Romans?<br />3. The body of a beheaded man is found in a shallow grave at Stonehenge. When and why was he killed?<br />4. Why were some people apparently immune to the Black Plague, while others caught it but didn't die?<br />5. Why did the British army suffer such a staggering defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana?<br />The chapter on the Black Plague is especially fascinating, because it explains how a genetic mutation that favored the survivors of the Black Plague also rendered their descendants immune to the HIV virus that causes AIDs.<br />The chapter on the Battle of Isandlwana provides an interesting explanation of the causes of the British disaster, but it minimizes the significance of the Battle of Rourke's Drift in a way that, in my opinion, is questionable. A more persuasive discussion can be found in Chapter 8 Victor Davis Hanson's &quot;Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power (2001).&quot;<br />If you enjoys books about historical mysteries, you might want to have a look at the following recent texts: Miller, &quot;Secrets of the Dead;&quot; Keys, &quot;Catasrophe&quot; (itself the topic of a two-hour &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; episode); James &amp; Thorpe, &quot;Ancient Mysteries&quot;; Fagan's &quot;The Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World;&quot; and Paul Aron's &quot;Unsolved Mysteries of American History,&quot; &quot;More Unsolved Mysteries of American History,&quot; and &quot;Unsolved Mysteries of History.&quot; Like &quot;More Secrets of the Dead,&quot; all of these books are sober discussions of real mysteries, and they are blissfully free of contrived sillines about ancient astronauts and Atlantis.Mysteries of American History,&quot; and &quot;Unsolved Mysteries of History.&quot; Like &quot;More Secrets of the Dead,&quot; all of these books are sober discussions of real mysteries, and they are blissfully free of contrived sillines about ancient astronauts and Atlantis.	2004-03-24

In clean and simple prose, he lays out the background, summarizes the competing theories and offers a reasoned solution, ending each essay with a brief but thorough annotated bibliography.<br />If you are looking for a book that offers sensational solutions to mysteries real or imagined, you'll probably be disappointed by the &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; series.  Aron fairly summarizes the &quot;off the wall&quot; theories about each of his mysteries, but he always comes to a conclusion that seems pretty plausible.

The searing cloud slammed into the city of St Pierre; within two minutes, the city was a pile of smoking rubble and 30,000 people were dead.<br />Asked to name the greatest volcanic disasters in history, most people would probably offer up Mt Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum; they might also volunteer the explosion of Krakatoa or the even more recent eruption of Mt. St Helens.  Mt Pelee and St Pierre are usually only vaguely recalled, which is remakable given the sheer size of the human tragedy.<br />Zebrowski's book does a marvelous job of taking the reader back to 1902, when scientists understood far less than they do now about what volcanos can do.  The series of eruptions at Mt Pelee were triggered by the rise of a huge bulge of magma from the subduction zone beneath the Lesser Antilles.  These forces set off Mt La Soufriere on the island of St Vincent, where pyroclastic flows and lahars killed two thousand people the day before St Pierre was destroyed; the rising magma also erupted in an undersea volcano at a spot called Kick 'em Jenny.<br />Zebrowski describes the weeks leading to the eruption of Mt Pelee and how the local inhabitants and French bureacracy struggled to understand what they were up against.  The blame for the disaster is often laid at the feet of Louis Mouttet, the governor of Martinique, but it is difficult to imagine what else he could have done.  At the time, scientists thought of volcanic eruptions in terms of slow moving rivers of lava rather than swift and deadly pyrolastic flows and lahars.  If Mouttet had tried to evacuate St. Pierre, he would have had very little support; even if he had succeeded, he would have created an enormous refugee crisis.<br />Zebrowski explains what life in St Pierre was like before the disaster, how Martinique's inhabitants coped with the increasingly dangerous volcano in their midst, what happened to the city and its people when the volcano erupted and afterward, how the French government handled (or failed to handle) the aftermath of the disaster, and how a courageous group of scientists and journalists explored the still-erupting volcano to understand what had happened.

Wells offers a somewhat revisionist history of the battle based on his interpretation of the archaeology at the battle site, which was finally located in 1987 at Kalkriese in northern Germany.<br />The broad outlines of the battle are reasonably well understood.  Arminius, a member of the Cherusci tribe who had served in the Roman army and had become a Roman citizen, drew three legions under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus into a trap east of the Rhine.  While the legions were on the march in a column that may have been over two miles long, they were ambushed by Germanic warriors.  The terrain and the extended column prevented the Roman units from forming up properly, with the horrific result that 20,000 or so men (and possibly a large group of camp followers) were killed on the spot, ritually sacrificed or enslaved.  The catastrophe cost the Roman army almost ten percent of its effective strength, revived Roman fears of an invasion by northern barbarians, and may have induced the Romans to halt the expansion of their empire at the Rhine River rather than pressing on to the Elbe.<br />Wells tends to dismiss classical descriptions of the battle, arguing that ancient historians suffered from the fact that they were not eyewitnesses, were often writing long after the fact, and were burdened by stereotyped and inaccurate notions of how the Germanic tribes fought.  He suggests that the battle did not take place over three days (as the writer Cassius Dio claimed 200 years later) but that the slaughter was essentially over in an hour, with the rest of the day devoted to capturing or killing the survivors.<br />According to the book's chapter notes, Wells bases his description of a short and bloody battle on historical information about Varus and his legions, Roman accounts of the battle, the archaeological and topographical evidence at Kalkriese, and information from other historical battles.  Wells' conclusions  may be right, but he could have done a better job of explaining why his analysis of these sources led him to reconstruct the battle as he did.  Although Wells offers a gripping description of what must have been a gruesome and terrifying encounter for all concerned, I suspect that his book will not be the last word on the subject.<br />All in all, Wells' book is a perfectly serviceable introduction to the history of this period.  Although the book is at times a bit repetitive and has drawn some sharply negative reviews (see below), I can honestly say that I enjoyed the book, read it avidly and thought it was fairly well done (which may explain why it is an Independent Bookseller's BookSense 76 pick).<br />Having said all this, Wells' bibliographical notes suggest that the seminal work on the archaeology of the battle is Tony Clunn's \\"In Quest of the Lost Legions,\\" which you can find on Amazon (or on Amazon's UK site for quite a bit less, if you don't mind waiting for a shipment from across the pond).

For example, Cook poses the intriguing question of whether human history as we know it was, broadly speaking, the only kind of history that humans could have made.  Specifically, was there anything inevitable about the development of farming and civilization, or might we have somehow \\"chosen\\" to remain nomads or hunter/gatherers or pastoralists?  Having posed this question, Cook skillfuly compares the development of civilizations in both the new world and the old world, concluding that, given enough time and population, agriculture and a civilization of some sort are inevitable outcomes of human history.<br />Cook's work explores a number of other interesting questions, such as why human history as we understand it appeared when it did (it has to do with the warm period that began about 10,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age) and why writing appeared first in civilized societies rather than earlier among hunter-gatherers.  Whether you agree with Cook or not, his answers to the broad questions of history are quite interesting, and his writing style is clear and enjoyable.<br />Keep in mind that Cook's focus is on the forest, not the trees. Although he discusses a few important historical events in order to make his points, \\"A Brief History of the Human Race\\" is a book about broad themes rather than a chronology of events.  If you want to learn the basics of world history, you would probably do better to start with a book like J.M.

When someone asks \\"who is the most famous sex symbol of the twentieth century?\\", Marilyn Monroe is a safe bet for the answer--but what about Donna Reed, named by one author as the most underrated sex symbol of her time?  And what about Robert E. Lee--was he the great strategist that history makes him out to be, or was he really \\"the original Teflon general\\"?<br />Overrated/Underrated pillories many icons and offers substitutes to replace them--as a result, it's bound to irritate readers, but that's half the fun.  And since each article is fairly short, the book can easily be interrupted and put aside (thus making it ideal for airplane travel).	2003-11-30

But history is contingent, and the only way to fully appreciate the significance of a given event is to think about what might have happened if things had turned out differently.<br />At first, I was a little put off by the \\"What If?\\" series of books, thinking the essays were probably more like works of science fiction than reliable articles about history.  For the most part, I was mistaken, and I recommend this book and its prequels (\\"What If?\\" and \\"What If2?\\") to anyone seeking a better understanding of some of history's conspicuous turning points.<br />The essays generally fall into three categories.  The first, which I enjoy the most, explain the historical context of a given occurrence and then engage in limited (but very illuminating) speculation about what might have happened if that event hadn't turned out the way it did.  Examples of this type include Theodore Rabb's \\"Might the Mayflower Not Have Sailed\\" and John Lukac's \\"No Pearl Harbor?: FDR Delays the War.\\"<br />Other essays also offer up the historical context but move on to engage in much bolder speculation.  An example is Caleb Carr's \\"William Pitt the Elder and the Avoidance of the American Revolution,\\" which explores a cascade of assumptions about how the 19th and 20th Century would have been different if Britain had kept the 13 colonies (the intriguing conclusion being that the world might have been better off).  The problem with this approach is that it assumes that events in the rest of the world would have stayed on more or less the same path notwithstanding a dramatic change in the outcome of the American revolution.  This enables Carr to speculate, for example, on a 19th century summit between Disraeli and Bismarck, but I wonder if either of those two persons would have played the same role in history had the events of the late 18th century been dramatically different than what they actually were.<br />The final type of essay dives right into the counterfactual world without clearly setting out the historical context.  Examples are Andrew Roberts \\"The Whale and the Wolf, \\" which immediately launches into a history of a hypothetical Anglo-American War of 1896 and Ted Morgan's \\"Joe McCarthy's Secret Life,\\" a tongue-in-cheek speculation that McCarthy was really a Soviet spy.  For my tastes, the problem with these essays is that they spend very little time distinguishing between what did and didn't actually happen, which means that the reader is less likely to learn about history than about the author's speculations.<br />On the whole, \\"What Ifs? of American History\\" is a very entertaining and readable book.  If you enjoy it, consider getting the other two \\"What If\\" books, as well as Victor David Hanson's \\"Ripples of Battle\\" (which shares many features with the \\"What If?\\" series).h century been dramatically different than what they actually were.<br />The final type of essay dives right into the counterfactual world without clearly setting out the historical context.

Morton explains the basics of geology using analogies that sometimes seem a bit forced (try using \\"grandma's apple pie\\" to illustrate plate tectonics), but I have to admit that the corny examples helped me to understand the subject better than more elegant discussions in other books.<br />All in all, I enjoyed reading Morton's book because he has a genuine and infectious enthusiasm for geology.

Hanson is an excellent writer with a vigorous style, and &quot;Ripples of Battle&quot; is a pleasure to read.  The book explores the &quot;ripples&quot; that flowed from three battles--Okinawa, Shiloh, and Delium--and explains how those ripples changed the world.<br />Human history would have been very different had the Greek philosopher Socrates been killed at the otherwise obscure Battle of Delium in 424 BC.  At the time, Socrates' most profound thinking was yet to come and Plato was only a child.  If Socrates had fallen along with hundreds of other Athenians, &quot;the entire course of Western philosophical and political thought would have been radically altered&quot; (216).<br />The Battle of Shiloh was likewise a crack in time.  Among other things, the fighting changed William Tecumseh Sherman from a failure to a hero and taught him that it was far less costly to wage war against civilian infrastructure than to fight a pitched battle against a modern army.  The March to the Sea began with the hard lessons that Sherman learned at Shiloh.<br />And at Okinawa, America learned how difficult it would be to force Japan to surrender, enduring fanatical resistance and suicidal attacks that cost the lives of thousands Americans and tens of thousands of Japanese.  Hanson argues that the experience yielded a cold American resolve and a willingness to use atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />Whether you agree with Hanson's conclusions or not, the journey is worth the price of admission.  History is often written is if key outcomes were inevitable, as if Socrates were ordained to lay the foundations of western philosphy or the north were bound to win the Civil War.  But history is contingent, and the only way to fully appreciate the significance of a given occurrence--especially the &quot;near run things&quot; that crop up in battle--is to think about what might have happened if the event had turned out differently.  In this respect, Hanson's book bears a kinship to the &quot;What If? series of essay collections--in fact, Hanson's original essays on Delium and the fate of Lew Wallace after Shiloh can be found in those books.<br />Of course, the biggest ripples that flow from these battles might be those that remain unseen.  We know that Socrates did not die at Delium and that the intellectual world as we know it depended on his survival--but we don't know whether Delium, or Shiloh, or Okinawa or any other event or battle ended the lives of other geniuses who might have changed history, for better or worse.  Those imponderables are left to more speculative works than this.to the &quot;What If? series of essay collections--in fact, Hanson's original essays on Delium and the fate of Lew Wallace after Shiloh can be found in those books.<br />Of course, the biggest ripples that flow from these battles might be those that remain unseen.

Bryson is not a scientist, but rather a curious and observant writer who, four or five years ago, realized that he couldn't tell a quark from a quasar, or a proton from a protein.  Bryson set out to cure his ignorance of things scientific, and this book is the result.<br />For readers who are new to science and its history, \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" contains one remarkable revelation after another.  You'll be amazed at how enormous, complex and just plain weird the world is and at how small a part humanity plays in it all.  It's a humbling experience, a little reminscent of Stephen Crane's blank verse: \\"A man said to the Universe: 'Sir, I exist!' 'However,' replied the Universe, 'the fact has not created in me a sense of obligation.'\\"<br />Just as engaging as the story of what we know is the parallel story of how we know it--from the first clever experiments to figure out things like how much the earth weighs to today's ongoing efforts to describe the origins of the universe itself, you come to appreciate that science is not an answer but a process, a way of learning about a world that always has one more trick up its sleeve.<br />Whatever else may be said about the universe, Bryson explains that learning about its mysteries is a very human endeavor.  And so his book is peppered with tales of the odd turns, like Percival Lowell, the astronomer who saw canals on Mars when in fact there are none (and whose initials figured in the naming of Pluto, the ninth planet); the Askesian Society, a learned 19th century body devoted to the study of laughing gas; and the knock-down, drag-out personal battles between scientists whose genius was rivaled only by their lack of civility.<br />This is a superb book and a quick read despite weighing in at nearly 500 pages.  If you enjoy \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything,\\" I highly recommend for further reading Daniel Boorstin's \\"The Discoverers\\" and \\"The Creators\\" and Timothy Ferris' \\"Coming of Age in the Milky Way,\\" all of which are elegant explorations of the history of science and how we have come to know what we think we know.ing Daniel Boorstin's \\"The Discoverers\\" and \\"The Creators\\" and Timothy Ferris' \\"Coming of Age in the Milky Way,\\" all of which are elegant explorations of the history of science and how we have come to know what we think we know.	2003-10-05

The book is a well-written page turner, and McCrary is refreshingly modest compared to some of his former colleagues.<br />McCrary reviews several cases, the most prominent of which are the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, the Buddhist Temple Massacre in Phoenix, Arizona, the search for the Scarborough Rapist (who eventually became a serial murderer), and the  prosecution of Jack Unterweger (an international serial killer who committed murders in Czechoslovakia, Austria and Los Angeles).  McCrary also re-visits the famous Sam Sheppard murder case, concluding that . . . well, just read the book for his solution to the case, which struck me as being fairly convincing.<br />If you have read books by other profilers, \\"The Unknown Darkness\\" will not offer you a great deal of new information about profiling techniques.  However, McRary and his co-author, Katherine Ramsland, manage to tell a gripping story.  McCrary's analysis of the Sam Sheppard murder case and the FBI's role in the show down with the Branch Davidians make for especially interesting reading--I can't recall having run across a \\"profile\\" of David Koresh or Sam Sheppard in other books of the genre.<br />The one significant criticism that I have of this book (and indeed of the books by all the other profilers) is that it has a certain \\"just so\\" quality to it.  Not surprisingly, the book talks about the home runs, the profiles that either did help solve a case or would have helped had the profile been used properly.  I'd be curious to know how many \\"misses\\" the FBI's BSU produces--in other words, how many profiles are way off the mark?  My guess is that the answer is \\"not many\\" (these guys seem to know what they're doing), but I'd be curious to see the ratio of hits to misses just to get a better sense of how much of criminal profiling is art and how much is science.<br />The \\"pop literature\\" about criminal profiling is at this point fairly extensive.  For further reading, try the following books by alums of the FBI's BSU (keeping in mind that this stuff is pretty grim and best taken in small doses): John Douglas (\\"Mindhunter,\\" \\"Obsession,\\" \\"Journey into Darkness,\\" \\"The Cases that Haunt Us,\\" and \\"The Anatomy of Motive\\"), Roy Hazelwood (\\"Dark Dreams\\" and \\"The Evil That Men Do\\"), Robert K.

In some respects, it is a dry academic book straight from a university press.  There is the inevitable chapter that offers a Freudian explanation for our vision of monsters, as well as the occasional Teutonic sentence that would be more at home in a turgid article than in an otherwise entertaining book.<br />You can breeze through the drier material (unless you revel in that sort of thing) and take advantage of the fact that Gilmore clearly loves his subject.  He energetically surveys stories of monsters from cultures all over the world, and he finds in these tales a deep commonality: monsters are always large, evil, physically grotesque, and determined to eat as many people as they can catch.  Such creatures are usually a bizarre mix of human and animal, and they are often divine or related in some way to the people on whom they prey.  In these stories, there is frequently a hero, himself superhuman and somewhat frightening, who is able to kill the local monster for the benefit of the community.<br />Readers who expect to find a tale of &quot;cryptozoology&quot;--of the physical search for legendary monsters like Bigfoot, Yeti and the Loch Ness serpent--will probably be disappointed.  Gilmore's monsters live in the landscape of the mind, and they will never be found in the forests and mountains of the physical world. Still, Gilmore's journey through the imaginations of many cultures is conducted with enthusiasm and vigor, and it is this quality that makes &quot;Monsters&quot; fun to read.	2003-09-13

The other, to total extinction.  Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.&quot;  McGuire's book is hard to put down, but it doesn't offer much comfort when it comes advice about how to escape the consequences of global disasters.<br />The short message is that there are some cataclysms that we can do absolutely nothing to prevent and that we can do very little to protect ourselves against.  McGuire describes four &quot;big ones&quot; that could plunge civilization into a new Dark Ages or cause the extinction of the human race.  These are a volcanic super eruption, a massive tsunami, a massive earthquake in Tokyo, and an asteroid or comet strike.<br />Each major section of the book explains the science behind these scenarios and describes what we know about how often these events have occurred in the past.  McGuire ends each chapter with a dramatic and lurid account of what happens when one of these things hits: Yellowstone Park (which is actually the caldera of a gigantic volcano) massively erupts, buries large parts of the United States under a blanket of ash and throws the rest of the world into a volcanic winter; the Cumbre Vieja volcano erupts and sends half the island of La Palma tumbling into the Atlantic, causing huge tsunamis that wipe out the east coast of the United States and all the coastal cities of western Europe and Africa; a magnitude 8.3 earthquake hits Tokyo, wiping the city out and causing worldwide economic catastrophe; a one kilometer wide piece of comet smashes into the earth, annihilating western Europe and plunging the rest of the world into mass starvation.<br />The troubling thing about all of this is that it is not a matter of &quot;if,&quot; but of &quot;when.&quot;  McGuire explains that super eruptions, comet and asteriod strikes, massive tsunamis and fairly large earthquakes are regular occurrences on a geological time scale, and they are bound to happen again.  The difference this time is that there is now a large and interdependent global civilzation in the way, and it is not likely to survive the encounter.<br />Having said all that, I have learned to take predictions of doom with a grain of salt.  The Y2K bug didn't live up to its billing, and I suspect that McGuire is underestimating how resourceful human beings can be in responding to disaster, even one on a global scale--we get a few brownie points for surviving ice ages and the last super eruption in 70,000 BC.  This doesn't mean that &quot;Apocalypse&quot; isn't sobering, or that the &quot;big one&quot; won't get us all eventually, but I'm not prepared to give up hope yet.fairly large earthquakes are regular occurrences on a geological time scale, and they are bound to happen again.

But O'Connell's book is less about the weapons themselves than it is about how, why and when human beings develop and use those weapons.<br />The book is filled with interesting little insights and &quot;aha!&quot; moments that make it a pleasure to read.  For example, historians are fairly certain that prehistoric towns were beset by warfare.  Catal Hutuk in Turkey was fortified, and its ruins include flint daggers, baked clay sling balls and mace heads.  O'Connell explains that maces were the first weapons designed mainly for killing other people--the mace is not especially useful for hunting animals, many of which are capable of withstanding such blows and are more easily brought down with pointed weapons.  But maces were perfect for cracking poorly protected human skulls, at least until the helmet was invented. Unlike spears and arrows, then, maces are unambiguous evidence that people began to make war on each other almost as soon as they had established &quot;civilization&quot;.<br />O'Connell describes many subsequent revolutions in weapons and tactics, from arrows and maces to the phalanx to the Pershing II missile.  Along the way, it becomes obvious that warriors are a fairly conservative lot--highly effective weapons, such as cannon, rifles, heavy artillery, and machine guns--are for centuries or decades ignored or poorly deployed not because they didn't work, but because they changed the rules of the game.<br />Having said all this, O'Connell seems to be cautiously optimistic about humanity's ability to put aside war.  He suggests that organized warfare (as opposed to homicide, which will always be with us) emerged along with settled agriculture.  He argues that war is not &quot;instinctive,&quot; and that there is thus some hope that advanced democracies can create an environment in which war is no longer a fact of human existence.  This is a consummation devoutly to be wished--if the ingenuity used to design weapons and tactics had been devoted instead to peaceful pursuits, the world would be a much nicer place to live in.an existence.

The book focuses on nine sites, which range from the late Neolithic through the Middle Ages.  Each of the sites contains human remains, and the book explains what those remains can tell us about how our ancestors lived in ancient times.<br />What makes the book especially engaging is that it tries to show how these people would have looked when they were alive.  Each chapter features either a portrait (often generated with the aid of computers) or a sculpture that puts flesh on dry bones.  In one particularly striking case, the author tells the story of Bleadon Man, an Iron Age farmer who died nearly 2,000 years ago.  Using DNA from his bones, scientists were able to identify five people who were living in the same English farming village 2,000 years later and who had DNA that was very similar to the ancient farmer--probably, but not certainly, these five are the farmer's distant relatives.  Then the scientists prepared a sculpture showing how the ancient farmer probably looked when he was alive.  The sculpture was compared to one of the modern villagers with similar DNA--and, as Richards puts it, &quot;from their faces they could have been brothers.&quot;  The picture that shows the descendant holding up the sculpture of his ancient forebear is worth the price of admission.<br />If you enjoy this book, you should also try Ian Wilson's &quot;Past Lives: Unlocking the Secrets of Our Ancestors,&quot; which explores several of the same cases and a few besides.	2003-06-29

The book covers natural deaths, deliberate deaths (murders and massacres), burials, mummies and mummifications, as well as how ancient people lived and what they ate, all in 36 chapters.  Each chapter is an article written by an expert on the subject, with editor Paul Bahn supplying the overall organization and continuity.<br />Because the chapters are written by different authors, they vary substantially in quality.  Some are well-written and provide a context for the stories they tell; others are fairly dry and look as though they were based on academic articles with the footnotes removed.  On the whole, however, the book is fascinating-- at times, it's even graphic and unsettling, especially when it deals with child sacrifice, murder, mayhem and (to the modern mind) rather bizarre burial practices.<br />If you are interested in the subjects covered by this book, here are a few other recommendations:  Chamberlain & Pearson, \\"Earthly Remains: The History and Science of Preserved Bodies\\" (2002); David & Archbold, \\"Conversations with Mummies\\" (2000); Wilson, \\"Past Lives: Unlocking the Secrets of Our Ancestors\\" (2001); and Richards, \\"Meet the Ancestors.\\"  I found the last two of these books to be especially fascinating, because they devote a substantial amount of space to showing what the owners of the excavated skeletons would have looked like in life (something that \\"Written in Bones\\" does only in a few chapters).	2003-06-29

In its amiable style, \\"Krakatoa\\" reminded me of Nicholas Clapp's \\"Road to Ubar\\" and \\"Sheba,\\" neither of which have anything to do with volcanoes but both of which are travelogues that explore history in a well-written and entertaining way.  It's all in the journey, not in the destination.<br />If you are looking for a book about how volcanoes blow up and devastate the things around them, you'll probably enjoy only a few chapters of Winchester's book (although I think you will enjoy them a great deal). For those who want to learn about how volcanoes have changed history (which is at least part of Winchester's thesis), check out David Keys' \\"Catastrophe\\" and the fascinating companion video of the same name, as well as De Boer & Sanders, \\"Volcanoes in Human History\\" and Pellegrino's \\"Unearthing Atlantis.\\" For a book about the destruction wrought by volcanoes, try \\"Vulcan's Fury: Mana Against the Volcano,\\" by Alwyn Scarth.<br />Finally, a word about the physical qualities of \\"Krakatoa\\":  I find that I really enjoy reading a book that has a nice colophon and seems to be made of high quality, well bound paper.

They used weapons that they found \\"in the theater\\" (i.e., fuel-laden civilian airliners) to inflict enormous casulaties on an unsuspecting civilian population. The 21st century thus began with the first \\"asymmetrical\\" war between a superpower and a shadowy but deadly opponent.<br />Bevin Alexander agrees that September 11 is a watershed event that \\"dramatically changed the face of war.\\"  But he also notes that the terrorists used the ancient tactic of the ambush, a hit-and-run strike against a defenseless or unprepared opponent.  Though the \\"war against terrorism\\" will doubtless offer up cruel novelties in the years to come, Bevin argues that history still has much to teach us about the strategies that win wars.<br />\\"How Wars Are Won\\" devotes a single chapter to each of 13 rules of war.  Bevin explains how these rules work in practice by describing examples drawn from throughout history.  For instance, the rule of \\"defend, then attack\\" is illustrated by battles that occurred during wars as diverse as the Byzantine invasion of Italy, the Hundred Years War and the American Civil War.<br />Bevin writes fairly well, and he does an excellent job of explaining why history's greatest generals won their battles, and why lesser leaders managed to lose.  I came away with a much better appreciation of the genius of Napoleon, Alexander the Great and Stonewall Jackson.<br />\\"How Wars are Won\\" also offers many interesting observations about how future wars are likely to be waged--including the one that will probably be fought in Iraq.  Bevin's book is required reading for another dark time in world history.	2003-02-23

Based on his own extensive work at the Meadowcroft rock shelter in Pennsvlvania and on the work of Tom Dillehay at Monte Verde in South America, Professor Adovasio argues passionately that the Americas were populated much earlier than 11,000 years ago, which is the approximate date usually given for the appearance of Clovis culture.<br />But Professor Adovasio's passion is what gives me pause.  Although I suspect that he is probably right in rejecting the &quot;Clovis bar,&quot; I have the definite feeling that I am only getting one side of a complex story.<br />I also found the book's numerous ad hominem attacks to be off putting--while complaining about the personal invective that has been directed at him and other advocates of pre-Clovis populations in the Americas, Professor Adovasio repeatedly slams his bete noir Vance Haynes and his allies.  At one point, the author announces that &quot;the sad fact is that the evidence is not going to make any difference to Vance, a man who, as one of his colleagues said, is now an example of someone whose mind has snapped shut, never to open again&quot; (p. 262).<br />That sort of statement makes Adovasio sound somewhat hypocritical, although I suppose he would argue that his opponents have given him plenty of reasons to retaliate in kind.  In any event the condition of Vance Haynes' mind is of little interest to me--Professor Adovasio and his supporters either win on the merits or they don't, and the book would have been more convincing if it had stuck to the facts without trying to make the reader dislike the &quot;other side&quot; as much as the authors obviously do.<br />&quot;The First Americans&quot; is worth reading, and I generally enjoyed it.

The text is filled with photographs of submarine wreckage and rescue efforts, dramatic paintings of submarines at sea, and diagrams showing how sumarines work.  Especially interesting is a detailed recreation of the CSS Hunley's pyrrhic victory against the hapless USS Housatonic during the American Civil War, together with some interesting speculation about why the Hunley sank after its successful attack.<br />The book's main weakness is that it surveys a big field that has been thoroughly covered in other works.  If you enjoy digging into the details, this book may disappoint you.

The book is a bit mistitled--Arabs and Turks command more of the author's attention than, say, the Vikings--but it is still an interesting survey of nomad warfare in the Dark and Middle Ages.<br />Kennedy explains why, for 1,000 years, the nomads were so successful in their wars against civilization.  They had incredible mobility, so that they could outmaneuver their opponents in battle.  If things went badly, they could quickly vanish into the desert, steppes or ocean from which they had come.  They were very tough and lived off the land, so they did not need long supply lines.  They had capable leaders, who led because of their skills rather than because they were members of an established nobility. And they were an army in search of a country: every male in the nomad population was likely to be a skilled warrior, whether that meant firing an arrow from the back of a pony or swinging a sword on the deck of a ship.<br />For nearly 1,000 years, the nomads threatened the civilized world.  But though they were very successful, surprisingly little is known about them: it may be true that history is written by the victors, but it is just as often the case that history is written by the people who can write.  Because nomad societies tended to be illiterate, their history was usually told by their horrified victims.<br />And their victims had plenty to be horrified about.  As Kennedy makes clear, the Mongols, Huns and Vikings had a very well-deserved reputation for cruelty and ruthlessness.  The nomad threat began to wane only with the emergence of gunpowder weapons, which could not be easily obtained by nomads but could be produced in abundance by stable societies.<br />\\"Mongols, Huns and Vikings\\" is a reasonably well written, informative and well-illustrated survey of the rise and fall of the nomad warriors.

The book seems to be very carefully researched and it is certainly well written--Dando-Collins is fascinated by his subject, and his enthusiasm shows.<br />The Tenth Legion was, for most of its history, an elite and honored unit. Like America's 82d and 101st airborne divisions, the Tenth enjoyed a world-wide reputation for skill in battle. Dando-Collins explains how the Tenth earned its stripes, from recruitment and training to victory as the legion that usually occupied the position of honor on Caesar's right flank. As he does so, he tells the story of the centurions and other soldiers in the legion--how they were recruited, how long their terms of enlistment could be expected to last, when they would be promoted (if they lived) and how they could expect to spend their retirement.<br />Dando-Collins also points out some things that are probably old hat to students of Roman military history, but are very interesting to someone who is new to the subject. He explains, for example, that Roman javelins were designed so that they would bend upon striking an enemy shield (or an enemy), thus preventing the weapon from being re-used against the attacking legion. He also describes the remarkable training, discipline and mobility of a legion--on campaign, a unit like the Tenth might disassemble its fortified camp, march a great distance, assemble another camp to precise military specifications, and then repeat the process day after day until the enemy was run to ground.<br />In battle, a Roman legion would fight in a tight, disciplined infantry formation and engage enemy units first with javelins, then with Spanish swords in what must have resembled a rugby scrum from hell. A well-trained legion like the Tenth won far more often than it lost--the Romans understood that a soldier should sweat in peace so that he didn't have to bleed in war.<br />The story of the Tenth is told in the context of the times. Dando-Collins follows the Legion as it helps Caesar pacify Gaul, crosses the Rubicon and fights a civil war, endures the assassinations of Pompey and Caesar, casts its lot with Antony at Actium, and finally captures the Zealot fortress at Masada. The Romans, it seems, were very skilled and very ruthless, and the Tenth Legion (for better or worse) represented the pinnacle of their military art.he didn't have to bleed in war.<br />The story of the Tenth is told in the context of the times.

The narrative focuses on the period from the emergence of Celtic culture in the first millennium BC through the collapse of the western Roman Empire, but it also touches upon the preservation and revival of Celtic culture through modern times.<br />The book is at times a bit dry--it's more like an encyclopedia or a series of brief topical essays than a sustained narrative.

The topics covered include serial killing, workplace violence, multiple personality disorder, killer cults, suicide, sexual misconduct by professional caregivers, rape, stalking and pyschopathic behavior.<br />In each area, Dr. Simon's analysis shows just how complex and surprising the human mind can be.  Even apparently straightforward questions, such as whether a given criminal is likely to be dangerous in the future, or whether a \\"suicide\\" is actually an accident, turn out to be very hard to answer.<br />At times, Dr. Simon's style is a bit academic, but on the whole he writes clearly and does a good job of covering a wide range of complex issues.	2002-09-28

Nickell agrees that &quot;the truth is out there&quot;--he just thinks that it's a lot more mundane than most people realize.<br />Nickell investigates 47 &quot;mysteries,&quot; including the Turin Shroud, spontaneous human combustion, crop circles, the Oak Island treasure, the Flatwoods UFO monster, the Roswell flying saucer crash and an assortment of hauntings, miracles and lake monsters.  True believers be warned: Nickell concludes that each of these events can be explained rationally and without resort to space aliens or the supernatural.<br />Nickell has an agreeable style, although at times it's a bit academic.  He doesn't talk down to his readers--he thinks that each mystery is worth investigating carefully and he is clearly having fun with his work.  In his own words, &quot;if we steer between the extremes of gullibility and dismissiveness--in other words, if our minds are neither too open nor too closed--we may learn more about our world and ourselves.  We may even have some fun doing it&quot; (p. 135).  I'm a card-carrying skeptic, so I love this stuff, but I think that an open-minded &quot;true believer&quot; might enjoy this book as well.<br />If you like &quot;Real-Life X-Files,&quot; I recommend any of Nickell's other books (&quot;Secrets of the Supernatural,&quot; &quot;Entities&quot; and &quot;Ambrose Bierce is Missing&quot;), as will as Hogart and Hutchinson's &quot;Bizarre Beliefs.&quot;  Each tells the skeptic's side of the story, but each is open minded and entertaining.	2002-09-01

On the one hand, Foss writes reasonably well and he does a good job of describing the First Crusade, beginning with Pope Urban II's call for crusade at Clermont in November of 1095 and continuing through the capture of Jerusalem in July of 1099.<br />On the other hand, the author relies heavily on material from a few contemporary sources. There's nothing inherently wrong with this approach, but in this case it results in a book that is about one half narrative and one half block quotations from the original sources. A little of that goes a long way, and the book would have flowed more smoothly if the author had digested the raw material and presented it more selectively.<br />As for the First Crusade itself, Foss makes it clear that it was a nasty, brutal business. Pope Urban II called for the Crusade at least in part to unify the warring factions of Christian Europe and to give them something to do besides killing each other. The ruthlessness that had until then been reserved for Europeans was suddenly visited upon the Islamic occupants of the Holy Land, with often horrific results for all concerned. Although the Crusaders come in for heavier criticism than their adversaries, each side seems to have had plenty to be ashamed of.<br />If the Crusades interest you, you might take a look at James Reston's \\"Warriors of God,\\" which is something of a tabloid account of the Third Crusade. Reston's book has been criticized for being too hard on the Crusaders, but regardless of whether that criticism is valid it is interesting reading.	2002-08-03

The archaeological record suggests that humans became physically modern about 120,000 years ago--if you could dress a human from that time in modern clothes, he or she would blend in on the streets of any modern city.<br />Behavior, however, is a different matter.  The authors present a very strong case that whatever it is that makes us fully \\"human\\" did not appear until about 50,000 years ago. At about that time, people suddenly started engaging in recognizably modern behaviors--producing stunning cave paintings, carving figurines, making complex ornaments, burying their dead with ritual, building semi-permanent structures, assembling an intricate tool kit, and expanding throughout the world.  The authors readily concede that there are a few ambiguous examples of similar behavior among more ancient Neanderthals and archaic homo sapiens, but the change after 50,000 years ago is a flood compared to the trickle that came before it.<br />To unravel the mystery of this abrupt event, the authors start with the appearance of australopithicenes and other \\"hominids\\" that may or may not be ancestral to modern humans.  They then carry the tale forward, describing \\"revolutions\\" in tool making and other behavior (of which there were very few before 50,000 years ago).<br />I was impressed by how careful the authors were in laying out their arguments for the lay reader.  Each point is clearly made, and the authors give fair treatment to scientists with whom they disagree.  They scrupulously note when they have chosen to accept one point of view over another.  The result is a meticulous, fair summary of what scientists know about the origins and development of the human species--as well as an intriguing answer to the mystery of how we came to be (no, I'm not going to give away the authors' theory--read the book).<br />If you enjoy \\"The Dawn of Human Culture,\\" there are two other books that you might want to read.  The first is \\"Origins Reconsidered,\\" by Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin.  Although the book is now a bit dated (it was published in 1992, before several significant discoveries in the late 1990s), it is a very well written tale describing the discovery of a lifetime.<br />The second is \\"Mapping Human History\\" --while not in the same scientific league as \\"The Dawn of Human Culture\\" or \\"Origins Reconsidered,\\" this book offers an often interesting story of what our genes tell us about human history.book).<br />If you enjoy \\"The Dawn of Human Culture,\\" there are two other books that you might want to read.

After reading dozens if not hundreds of these books, I have found that the ones that stick with me are the ones that are beautifully written.<br />\\"A Storm in Flanders\\" is such a book, focusing on the British experience in the Ypres Salient during World War I.  Groom wrote \\"Forrest Gump,\\" as well as several history books.  He knows how to put a sentence together and how to tell a gripping story.  Once I picked this book up and started reading, I was hooked.<br />Much as Stephen Ambrose has done in his elegant books about World War II, Groom moves seamlessly between the generals in their chateaus and the grunts in their trenches.  He makes use of diaries and poetry to tell the human story of a struggle that is all too often reduced to an abstract description of maneuver and battle.  And he is very fair in his assessments--he acknowledges the criticisms of General Haig and many of the other leaders of the war, but he is always careful to balance these views with other considerations.  The result is a well-told tale, fair and sympathetic to everyone involved.<br />The story of the Ypres Salient is not pretty.  Groom does not pull his punches and does his best to give the reader, sitting in a comfortable armchair, some sense of just how horrible the Great War was. In a passage that I found especially memorable, Groom quotes Lieutenant Alfred J. Angel of the Royal Fusiliers during Third Ypres:  \\"The stench was horrible, for the bodies were not corpses in the normal sense.  With all the shell-fire and bombardments they'd been continually disturbed, and the whole place was a mess of filth and slime and bones and decomposing bits of flesh.\\"<br />How anyone could live and fight in this hell on earth without going mad is simply beyond my comprehension, yet many British, French and German soldiers managed to do just that for four years running.  Groom doesn't delve too deeply into the psychology of the soldiers, observing that \\"the search for 'why' and 'how' remains elusive and any effort to reason it out is to fashion a mirror of hell itself.\\"  He is probably right in saying that \\"[a] truly sobering thing would be a glimpse of what was actually going on in their minds during the fighting.  That would not only be sobering; it would be perfectly frightening.\\"<br />If you like a \\"A Storm in Flanders,\\" I would recommend two other books.  The first is \\"Face of Battle\\" by John Keegan, which tries to explain how soldiers keep fighting despite the horrors of war and the threat of instant death.  The second is Sir Martin Gilbert's \\"The First World War,\\" which describes the entire war using a relentless chronology that is truly compelling.

There is no room in this book for theories about how one \\"race\\" is somehow better than another--or even for the idea that the term \\"race\\" has any meaning at all.  Our cultures may have divided us, but our DNA betrays the fact that we are all descended from a small group of modern humans who lived in eastern Africa about 100,000 years ago.  There simply hasn't been enough time to make us dramatically different from each other, despite what racists would have us believe.<br />The theory that modern humans originated in Africa fairly recently and then spread throughout the world is still, of course, hotly debated.  A number of reputable scientists favor the multiregional hypothesis, which claims that modern humans evolved in various places around the world from archaic populations already living in those regions.  The mutliregional hypothesis implies that the differences between modern groups are deeply rooted in the very distant past.  Olson clearly disagrees with that view, and he does a good job of presenting the genetic evidence that points to a more recent African origin (sometimes called the \\"Out of Africa II\\" hypothesis).<br />In the course of doing so, Olson touches on many interesting points.  A few of the more striking were these:<br />First, Olson describes recent DNA research indicating that Neanderthals were in fact a different species from our own.  This is another hotly debated proprosition, and I suspect that experts could criticize the DNA analysis that Olson describes on the grounds that it's pretty hard to make sense of 35,000 year old DNA.  Still, Olson makes a good case that the new results are compelling and consistent with other evidence.<br />Second, Olson describes the Jewish tradition that the male descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, will be the high priests of the Israelites.  Genetic research among the kohanim (priests), who often have a surname like Cohen, Cohn, or Kahn, suggests that many of these persons are in fact descended from a common male ancestor, who may indeed have been Aaron.<br />Finally, Olson explains why everyone on the planet at this point probably has some genetic material contributed by Julius Caesar and Confucius, among others.  It's a small world after all, at least as far as our DNA is concerned.<br />The only part of the book that I didn't enjoy were the last couple of chapters, which shift from the topic at hand (i.e., \\"mapping human history\\") to questions of ethics.  While these issues are important, they are too complex to be explored well in the fifty or so pages that Olson alots to them, and the discussion tends to detract from the fascinating \\"deep history\\" that is the focus of the rest of the book.ent with other evidence.<br />Second, Olson describes the Jewish tradition that the male descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, will be the high priests of the Israelites.

Reston's story is spiced with the words of poets and bards, and it breathes life into a fascinating and all but forgotten time.<br />I have not read a great deal about the Crusades, so it is difficult for me to judge how historically accurate Reston's book is. But I can say that \\"Warriors of God\\" is very entertaining, that the story is often moving, and that the characters are fascinating.<br />Saladin was a remarkable leader who united Egypt and Syria and captured Jersualem for Islam. Equally striking, according to Reston, he was a relatively decent man in a brutal time--he preferred bargaining to killing and went out of his way to avoid destroying the people that he defeated. Legend has it that he sent King Richard two fine Arabian horses when Richard lost his mount in a battle with Saladin's troops--after all, a King should not be on foot with his men!  Whether or not the legend is true, it says something that it was apparently repeated and believed.<br />King Richard was cut from a much rougher mold. He was a charismatic but tough leader, and he was not above killing prisoners to make a point. But for all his hardness, he lost his nerve and the Third Crusade when he was on the verge of capturing Jerusalem. After he withdrew from the Holy Land, he embarked on an odyssey, spending a year as the captive of the Holy Roman Emperor and finally returning to England in time to save the country from his brother, John.<br />The focus of the book is on King Richard and Saladin, but the minor characters are intriguing in their own right. One of these was Sinan, the \\"Old Man of the Mountain,\\" who ruled the cult of the Assassins. Reston calls him brilliant, ruthless, mystical and ascetic, \\"with eyes as fierce as meteors.\\" Sinan's followers owed him unquestioning obedience and would regularly kill at his command. \\"Once, to prove the devotion of his followers to a Crusader leader, Sinan had given a fleeting hand signal to two fidai high in a tower at Kahf, whereupon the two leaped to their death in the ravine below.\\" Not a person to be taken likely, and a reminder that sometimes the past is not all that different from today.<br />Reston tells us that shortly after Saladin died on March 4, 1193, his scribe Beha al-Din wrote \\"so passed those years and men, and seem, both years and men, to be a dream.\\" In \\"Warriors of God,\\" Reston has done done a good job of bringing those years and men to life for the modern reader.<br />If you enjoy \\"Warriors of God,\\" you might also want to take a look at Reston's \\"The Last Apocalypse,\\" which is an equally entertaining book about Europe at the turn of the first millennium AD.\\"Once, to prove the devotion of his followers to a Crusader leader, Sinan had given a fleeting hand signal to two fidai high in a tower at Kahf, whereupon the two leaped to their death in the ravine below.\\" Not a person to be taken likely, and a reminder that sometimes the past is not all that different from today.<br />Reston tells us that shortly after Saladin died on March 4, 1193, his scribe Beha al-Din wrote \\"so passed those years and men, and seem, both years and men, to be a dream.\\" In \\"Warriors of God,\\" Reston has done done a good job of bringing those years and men to life for the modern reader.<br />If you enjoy \\"Warriors of God,\\" you might also want to take a look at Reston's \\"The Last Apocalypse,\\" which is an equally entertaining book about Europe at the turn of the first millennium AD.	2002-05-21

The general editor is Paul Bahn, a well-known archaeologist who is also the editor of the &quot;Cambridge History of Archaeology.&quot;  The contributors are scientists who appear to be well-qualified to write on the subjects they are discussing--there are no lay authors to misunderstand or sensationalize things, nor are there any tales of Ancient Astronauts or Atlantis.<br />The book is chronologically arranged within sections on Africa, Europe, Asia, and New World/Oceania.  It is also well illustrated, with many color photographs of sites, remains and artifacts.<br />Published in 2001, &quot;Archaeology Detectives&quot; also reviews some cutting-edge developments.  For example, the chapter on &quot;Sterkfontein: The Case of Little Foot&quot; tells the story of how archaeologists used some foot bones in a box to locate an Australopithecine skeleton.  That skeleton is still being removed from the rock at Sterkfontein, but it is already producing a wealth of information about ancient hominids.<br />My only criticism of the book is that some of the articles are a bit too short--the piece on Masada, for example, is tantalizing but ends abruptly.  Of course, this is a &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; book, so I suppose that isn't surprising.<br />If you enjoy &quot;Archaeology Detectives,&quot; you might want to take a look at the well-illustrated &quot;Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World&quot; (edited by Brian Fagan).  That book also features short articles written by qualified scientists, though it covers ground that is generally different from that explored in &quot;Archaeology Detectives.&quot;	2002-05-05

Horne explains why Austerlitz was Napoleon's most brilliant battle, carried out when he and his soldiers were at their peak. Using that battle as its frame of reference, the book describes the rise and fall of Napoleon and the Grand Army.<br />My only complaint is that \\"How Far from Austerlitz?\\" looks at this fascinating period almost exclusively from the perspective of Napoleon and other major players. While that's fine as far as it goes, I would have preferred an \\"Ambrose-style\\" narrative that also told the story of the rank-and-file Napoleonic soldier.	2002-04-29

It was also strategically important--it was located at the mouth of the Nile, and it controlled an enormous portion of the Mediterranean wheat trade.<br /><br />Vrettos' book explains how and why Alexandria was built, why it was so important in the politics of the ancient world, and how it nurtured the science, philosophy and religion that are a central part of our modern world.<br /><br />Much of \\"Alexandria\\" is taken up with a description of the world of ideas, which I found to be edifying but a little dull. More entertaining (at least for me) was the author's lengthy digression into the romance and alliance between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra VII, and the later struggles between her, Marc Antony and Octavian.  (Other reviewers have criticized Vrettos for spending so much time on this old but fascinating story, but I guess that's just a matter of taste.)<br /><br />On the whole, the author's style is readable but a little dry, and there are a few striking inaccuracies and inconsistencies in some of the dates given for different events.  It makes me wonder a little about how precise the author is in his other judgments.<br /><br />For a more engaging work that describes Alexandria in a somewhat different context, you might want to have a look at \\"In Search of Cleopatra\\" by Michael Foss, which is also available on Amazon.com.	2002-04-13

She was more brilliant than beautiful, a consummate politican and a ruthless leader.  She was the mistress of the two most powerful Roman leaders of her era, partly because she wanted her Ptolemaic dynasty to survive and partly because she seems to have been genuinely devoted to her two lovers.<br />The \\"Search for Cleopatra\\" is not a biography as such.  Rather, it tells the story of a pivotal time in which Cleopatra played a central role.  Foss sketches all of the major protagonists--Julius Caesar, Marc Antony, Octavian and a host of lesser characters--against the background of the Roman civil wars and Cleopatra's skilled but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to come out on top in a very high stakes game.<br />Was Cleopatra a cruel, calculating woman, a person who did not hesitate to execute her younger brother and sister in order to rule unchallenged?  Or was she a loving mother, concerned about the welfare of her children and genuinely in love with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony?  As with any complex character, the answer may be \\"both,\\" and this well-written book does an excellent job of making a powerful woman and a dangerous time a bit more understandable to the modern reader.<br />If you are interested in the life and times of Cleopatra, you might also want to pick up \\"Alexandria: City of the Western Mind\\" by Theodore Vrettos.  Vrettos devotes a substantial part of his book to telling the story of Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, but he also describes how Alexandria transmitted Greek culture to the modern world.  Another interesting view of the subject is \\"Not by a Nose,\\" an essay by Josiah Ober in \\"What If? 2,\\" which ponders how the world might have been different if Antony and Cleopatra had defeated Octavian at the Battle of Actium.bject is \\"Not by a Nose,\\" an essay by Josiah Ober in \\"What If? 2,\\" which ponders how the world might have been different if Antony and Cleopatra had defeated Octavian at the Battle of Actium.	2002-03-23

As one would expect from the publishers, &quot;What Life Was Like&quot; is beautifully illustrated, featuring breathtaking photographs of  Ireland.<br />What the book lacks is an exciting, sustained narrative.  Although the text touches upon the interesting lives of St. Patrick, St. Columba and King Brian Boru, it lacks the crisp storytelling of books like Reston's &quot;The Last Apocalypse&quot; or Howarth's &quot;1066.&quot;  And considering that &quot;What Life Was Like&quot; covers 800 years of Irish history, it weighs in it a very superficial 130 pages--most of which are taken up with pictures! (It does, however, include a useful pronunciation guide and a helpful summary of the origins of various Irish surnames.)<br />I liked &quot;What Life Was Like&quot; well enough to buy a few other volumes in the series, but I view this one as &quot;history lite,&quot; an agreeable diversion for a rainy Sunday afternoon but not good enough to keep a reader going late into the night.	2002-03-10

Howarth does not conceal his views, admitting at the outset that he &quot;would have liked King Harold, heartily disliked King Edward the Confessor, felt sorry for Earl Tostig and terrified of Duke William, and found nothing whatever to say to King Harald Hardrada of Norway.&quot;  This is history with a bit of passion, which makes it all the more enjoyable for the reader.<br />&quot;1066&quot; will also make you appreciate how hard it is to know anything about a time like the Middle Ages, when very few people could read and write and those who could were invariably working for whoever won the latest battle.  It will also give a sense of how contingent history is, of how the world might have become a very different place if a few events had happened in a different order.  As it was, William the Conqueror arrived at exactly the right time, while King Harold was at the other end of England crushing King Harald Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.  What would have happened if William's fleet had been destroyed in a storm, or if he had arrived in England in the summer of 1066, when King Harold was ready and able to meet him?  We'll never know--King Harold and his army arrived at Hastings exhausted and depleted, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br />Howarth approaches 1066 as if it were the stuff of a novel, and he has been criticized for doing so.  I don't know whether Howarth is perfectly accurate, or whether his &quot;spin&quot; on the story is correct--but the same can be said of the most boring and heavily footnoted history that anyone cares to name.  For those who enjoy history but also prize elegant and engaging storytelling, this book is a joy to read.<br />If you like &quot;1066,&quot; you will want to consider two other books: James Reston's &quot;The Last Apocalpyse,&quot; a vivid description of life and strife in Europe at the turn of the first millennium; and Lacey and Danziger's &quot;The Year 1000,&quot; which explains what life may have been like for a person living in England in that distant time.two other books: James Reston's &quot;The Last Apocalpyse,&quot; a vivid description of life and strife in Europe at the turn of the first millennium; and Lacey and Danziger's &quot;The Year 1000,&quot; which explains what life may have been like for a person living in England in that distant time.	2002-03-06

He vividly describes the historical figures who lived (and often died) at the turn of the first millennium.  Their names alone promise a good story: Olaf Trygvesson, Thorgeir the Lawspeaker, Queen Sigrid the Haughty, Svein Forkbeard, Ethelred the Unready, Gerbert the Wizard, and Otto the Dreamer, to name a few.  As Reston tells it, these people were the protaganists in a grand struggle by which Europe was converted to Christianity.<br />Reston tries to be historically accurate, but he allows that &quot;in portraying this dark and illiterate age, the oral tradition is the stuff of our history.  In this work, I embrace it.&quot;  And so the broad outlines of known events are colored in with poetry and saga.  Still, that's not a bad approach--Reston is careful to distinguish between history and legend, and his use of oral tradition makes his subjects come alive despite one thousand years of distance.<br />If you like this book, I think you'll also enjoy &quot;The Year 1000: What Life was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium,&quot; by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger, which is a short but fascinating description of English life in and around 1000 AD.

I happen to like his books, though I can understand why others might disagree.<br />First, the strong points of \\"Blood of Revolution\\": Durschmied knows how to tell an exciting story, and he has picked some dramatic tales to work with.  Some are well known: the climax of the French Revolution in 1792; the Russian Revolution of 1917; the plot to kill Hitler, which nearly succeeded in July 1944; the palace coups that tried to prevent Japanese Emperor Hirohito from broadcasting the order that ended World War II; and the revolution in Iran, which brought the Ayatollah Khomeini to power and led to an international crisis in which 52 Americans were held hostage.<br />Other events are a little more obscure, at least to me: the martyrdom of the Tyrolean folk hero Andreas Hofer in 1809; the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1919; the Spartcisit revolution in post-World War I Germany; and the capture and execution of Che Guevara in Bolvia in 1967.<br />Each of these stories is told with gusto.  The people involved are cruel or kind, cowardly or bold, wise or foolish, without a lot of shading in between.  The prose is often a bit lurid--Durschmied seems to be in love with all of the adjectives that Hemingway did without. And the author is always very certain of himself, which makes me a bit suspicious about his conclusions.<br />Although Durchmied has a vigorous writing style, it has some quirks that have irritated other reviewers.  Keep in mind that the author is an Austrian-born journalist who emigrated to Canada during World War II and now lives in Paris and Provence--that's enough language experience to play havoc with anyone's syntax.  As for me, his style kept me turning the pages (though I admit to wincing a few times).<br />If you're looking for a sober, scholarly history, this book probably isn't for you.  And if you are already familiar with the events that Durschmied describes (as I was with the fall of Japan), you aren't going to learn a lot that's new.  But if you think you would enjoy a quick and passionate survey of some interesting historical events, this book and its predecessors \\"The Hinge Factor\\" and \\"The Weather Factor\\" are definitely worth picking up.<br />And, for the Durschmied fan, here's a tip: for some reason or other, Durschmied's books appear in the United Kingdom about a year before they arrive in the United States.  \\"Blood of Revolution,\\" for instance, was published in February 2001 under the title \\"Whisper of the Blade\\" (see what I mean about melodrama?).  And Durschmied just published \\"The Hinges of Battle: How Chance and Incompetence Have Changed the Face of History,\\" which can be found on Amazon's UK site--I already have my copy in hand.events that Durschmied describes (as I was with the fall of Japan), you aren't going to learn a lot that's new.

But Probably Not the Last	Shannon and Blackman have written an interesting book about the career of Robert Philip Hanssen, the FBI \\"mole\\" who was arrested in February 2001 for spying for the KGB and its successors.<br />The authors' prose is clear and crisp, and in the end they settle for a \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" approach to the story.  The book discusses Hanssen's childhood, education, career with the FBI, religious convictions, sexual fantasies, as well as the secrets he betrayed.  Hanssen emerges as a study in contradictions: a vocal anti-Communist who spies for the Soviet Union; a devout Catholic who sells vital secrets to an atheist government; an apparent prude who patronizes a stripper and posts odd fantasies about his sex life on the Internet.<br />Hanssen betrayed everything that he claimed was important to him--his wife, his family, his friends, his religion, and his country.  But the motive for his horrendous crimes, which he committed over the course of more than twenty years, is anything but clear.  I would have loved it if this book had had more to say about the psychology of a spy, but it didn't.  How can someone like Hanssen wake up and go to work every morning, knowing what he's risking and what he's done?  Why doesn't the contradiction between his public image and his life cause him to break down?  Is he able to compartmentalize things, so that the \\"good\\" Hanssen can live his life while the \\"bad\\" Hanssen\\" lives a lie?  Is he just a sociopath, who doesn't really care about anyone or anything but himself?  Maybe the FBI's own behavioral science unit will weigh in on this subject one day, but Shannon and Blackman don't venture down this dangerous trail.  For better or worse, they describe \\"what\\" Hanssen is without really explaining \\"why\\" he is.<br />Another gap in the book is that, apart from a few generalizations, it doesn't address why the FBI and CIA seem so incompetent when it comes to catching spies (not that the KGB comes off looking a whole lot better).  Perhaps the problem is that resources aren't allocated well, or that FBI and CIA personnel aren't trained to recognize the behavioral patterns of a spy--whatever the reason, the book largely leaves that problem to the reader's imagination.<br />The thing that should really strike you about this book is the realization that, for the last 25 years, there has always been at least one--usually several--moles who are busily selling vital American secrets.  And those are just the ones that we know about.  There is no obvious reason to think that there aren't just as many spies today as there have been in the last two decades.  A book like this cries out for an explanation: what, if anything, are the FBI and the CIA doing to make sure that a disaster like Hanssen doesn't happen again?e problem is that resources aren't allocated well, or that FBI and CIA personnel aren't trained to recognize the behavioral patterns of a spy--whatever the reason, the book largely leaves that problem to the reader's imagination.<br />The thing that should really strike you about this book is the realization that, for the last 25 years, there has always been at least one--usually several--moles who are busily selling vital American secrets.

Books	4	33	35	N	N	The Vibrating String	For someone who enjoys both history and natural science, &quot;Volcanoes in Humany History&quot; is a happy marriage.  It's not exactly a page-turner, because the authors don't try to be too dramatic.  They do, however, write simply and clearly, letting the eruptions and their consequences speak for themselves.<br />The authors' thesis is that each major eruption produces a &quot;vibrating string&quot; of historical effects, ranging from the eruption itself, to the immediate aftermath, to climate change, famine and epidemic, to economic and ecological revival, and finally to cultural effects that can span centuries.<br />The book covers nine volcanic systems, their eruptions and the resulting historical fallout: The Hawaiian Islands, where the clash between lava and ocean gave rise to a colorful mythology; Thera, whose catastrophic eruption in the Bronze Age may have destroyed Minoan civilization and produced the legend of Atlantis; Mount Vesuvius, whose eruption in 79 AD entombed and preserved the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum; Iceland, whose position above a magma plume and the spreading ocean floor gave rise to horrific eruptions and grim legends; Mount Tambora, the Indonesian volcano that caused the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot; in 1816; Krakatau, whose tidal waves killed tens of thousand of people in 1883; Mount Pelee, whose pyroclastic flows killed the 30,000 citizens of St. Pierre in an instant in 1902; Tristan da Cunha, whose eruption displaced an idyllic island society; and Mount St. Helens, which in 1980 reminded the Pacific Northwest that &quot;the Giants are only asleep.&quot;<br />If you enjoy &quot;Volcanoes in Human History,&quot; you'll probably like these books as well:<br />&quot;Catastrophe,&quot; by David Keys, which theorizes that a volcanic eruption in 536 AD caused the collapse of civilizations around the globe and brought on the Dark Ages in Europe.<br />&quot;Unearthing Atlantis,&quot; by Charles Pellegrino, which argues that the eruption of Thera gave rise to the legend of Atlantis.<br />&quot;Return to Sodom and Gomorrah,&quot; by Charles Pellegrino, which speculates (among other things) that the eruption of Thera gave rise to the Biblical stories of the Exodus.at the eruption of Thera gave rise to the legend of Atlantis.<br />&quot;Return to Sodom and Gomorrah,&quot; by Charles Pellegrino, which speculates (among other things) that the eruption of Thera gave rise to the Biblical stories of the Exodus.	2002-01-26

He explains that life is not risk free, terrorism is not new and Americans are much better at stopping terrorists than you might think.  Even after September 11, you face a much higher risk of being killed or injured in your car than in a terrorist attack or a plane crash.  Thousands of people will die this year from complications caused by the flu--yet many of those who hoarded Cipro probably did not get a flu shot.  de Becker's point is that while we should be vigilant about terrorism, we should not stand around and quake in our collective boots.<br />To help the reader understand where the fear is coming from, de Becker carefully analyzes the endless hand wringing of television news reporters.  In the months that followed September 11, I grew very impatient with the stories streaming in from CNN, Fox News, and even the BBC--they just didn't match reality.  The war in Afghanistan was supposed to go on for years (wrong), the allied forces were supposed to lose countless aircraft to Stinger missiles (wrong), the fierce Afghan and Al Qaeda warriors were going to bloody our groundtroops (wrong), the terrorists were poised to blow up American bridges and poision &quot;the nation's&quot; water supply (wrong so far), and Americans were hiding under their beds in fear of the next terrorist attack (wrong--everyone I know took a deep breath and kept on flying and living).<br />Becker zeroes in on the &quot;code words&quot; that television journalists use to mask a weak but scary story.  If you learn nothing else from &quot;Fear Less,&quot; it will be that you can relax more if you turn off the television and read the newspaper instead.<br />Having confronted our fears, de Becker offers some helpful guidance about how we can cope with the latest terrorist warnings from the grim and humorless Attorney General Ashcroft.  Most of us are not good at identifying suspicious behavior--we rationalize what we see and ignore our intuition.  de Becker proposes some suggestions to help us separate the wheat from the chaff, though most of these are too general to be of much practical use.<br />More helpfully, de Becker describes who among us is in the best position to spot potential terrorist activity as well as what we should be looking for: the list includes the usual suspects (employees of truck rental businesses and sellers of fertiziler), as well as several that are a bit surprising (such as librarians and bookstore owners, who are in a position to observe people with an unhealthy interest in books or internet sites dealing with explosives).  He also reviews September 11 and other attacks to explain how terrorist activities can be identified.  If people read Chapter 5 of &quot;Fear Less,&quot; we will all have a better chance of making sense of Ashcroft's endless warnings and actually spotting some of the terrorist activity we're all worried about.<br />My biggest criticism of the book is that it is too general, and it reads like a self-help book rather than an analysis of terrorism and what the average citizen can do to oppose it.  In de Becker's defense, &quot;Fear Less&quot; was rushed into print to address the fears arising from September 11--it's intended to be, and is marketed as, &quot;self-help/current affairs.&quot;  The author's prompt response has done us all a service, but I hope that the future will bring us a more comprehensive book--with more concrete examples and advice.<br />For further reading: If you are interested in books that explain what the risks are (and aren't) in our modern world, try de Becker's &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot; and Glassner's &quot;The Culture of Fear.&quot;can cope with the latest terrorist warnings from the grim and humorless Attorney General Ashcroft.

Books about military history are often fairly dry, but Hanson writes clearly and in the active voice, perhaps unconciously emulating the Western military tactics he describes.<br />He argues that Western success on the battlefield is a cultural phenomenon, not just the result of good fortune in the allocation of resources or the serendipity of technology.  Free nations produce leaders and soldiers who take the initiative.  Citizens who are protected by law against arbitrary action feel free to &quot;audit&quot; battles and criticize soldiers, leading to improved strategy and tactics.  Western military commands are heirarchical, but not unduly so, so that they adapt well to changing circumstances.  The result is an approach to battle that has been evolving since the time of the ancient Greeks, and that now involves applying maximum disclipline and violence at the point of engagement in order to annihilate, not merely defeat, an opponent.<br />Hanson discusses a series of battles to illustrate the differences between the &quot;Western&quot; style of war and the practices of cultures that he deems to be &quot;non-Western&quot;: Salamis (480 BC); Gaugamela (331 BC); Cannae (216 BC); Poitiers (732); Tenochtitlan (1520-21); Lepanto (1571); Rourke's Drift (1879); Midway (1942) and Tet (1968).  Each of these struggles illustrates a Western preference for decisive battle that inflicts enormous and disproportionate casualties on the loser.<br />Throughout, Hanson is very careful to stress that the losers are brave, smart individuals--he is not a racist and goes out of his way to explain that, person for person, the citizens of the West are no better than their non-Western counterparts.  He does, however, argue that Western culture, for better or worse, produces better results on the battlefield than non-Western culture does.  This position is sure to be viewed as politically incorrect, but it is certainly worth pondering.<br />&quot;Carnage and Culture&quot; is particularly interesting in these troubled times.  I began reading the book shortly after the September 11 attacks, and I have found it to be highly predictive of the American conduct of the war in Afghanistan, as well as America's relentless success in that war. The collapse of the Taliban that seems remarkable to media pundits and those untutored in the Western way of war looks almost inevitable to those who have read Hanson's work. A wounded republic, like Rome after its horrendous defeat at Cannae, is a determined and ruthless enemy.  As the historian Ross Leckie wryly observed in &quot;Hannibal&quot;: &quot;The Romans were a thorough lot.  Carthage is a memory.&quot;<br />Having said all this, Hanson's book leaves almost untouched some fairly important questions.  If freedom and initiative are so critical to Western military success, how do we explain the performance of totalitarian Germany's military in the early years of World War II and its quick defeat of the French democracy in 1940?  Why were the Soviets, who endured purges and arbitrary executions in the 1930s and throughout World War II, ultimately successful against the more &quot;Westernized&quot; Germans?  I suspect that Hanson could offer cogent answers to these questions, but it puzzles me that he did not volunteer them in his book.viewed as politically incorrect, but it is certainly worth pondering.<br />&quot;Carnage and Culture&quot; is particularly interesting in these troubled times.

Because the book is chatty and draws fairly abrupt conclusions, it reads a bit like a series of lectures--which it may well be, given that Cantor is a professor at NYU.<br />Be that as it may, Cantor seems to be at his weakest when he deals with the science of the plague.  For instance, he argues rather peremptorily that the Black Plague consisted of more than just bubonic plague, and that in many cases the real culprit was anthrax.  I found this claim to be very interesting (especially in light of the recent anthrax terror in the United States), but Cantor's position is not supported by the kind of in-depth analysis that I would expect for such a statement.  Moreover, Cantor glosses over the significance of plague reservoirs and vectors (fleas and rats, in the case of the bubonic plague) in a way that suggests an incomplete presentation of plague science.  This is not to say that Cantor is wrong in his conclusions, but it does mean that Cantor doesn't make a convincing case for them.<br />The book is much stronger when Cantor is in his element, the intricacies of Middle Age society.  He explains in exquisite detail how the plague affected the European labor market, gave rise to peasant revolts, caused an enormous redistribution of wealth for various archane reasons, brought an end to English ambitions in France, and led to the heartless persecution of Jews throughout Europe.<br />Cantor's analogies help make the Medieval world a bit more understandable to today's reader.  Thus, a noble lord or an abbot during the Black Plague looks and acts a lot like the CEO of a modern corporation in crisis; noble families are not merely rich, but billionaires in today's terms.  In these and many other ways, Cantor does a good job of translating the experience of a very alien time into frames of reference that the modern reader can grasp.<br />Cantor's book reminds me of Lacey &amp; Danziger's &quot;The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium,&quot; which I strongly recommend to anyone interested in the Middle Ages.  Another book that looks promising (though I haven't read it yet) is Reston's &quot;The Last Apocalypse: Europe at the Year 1000 A.D.&quot;<br />As for the science of the plague, I recently read what I consider to be a convincing explanation of the disease's origin and spread in David Keys' &quot;Catastophe&quot; (about the plague that afflicted the Byztantine Empire in the sixth century).  Hugh Miller's &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; (which can be found on Amazon's UK site) includes a very interesting chapter explaining why the descendants of plague survivors are often immune (or at least resistant) to AIDs, a subject that Cantor briefly discusses in his book.frames of reference that the modern reader can grasp.<br />Cantor's book reminds me of Lacey &amp; Danziger's &quot;The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium,&quot; which I strongly recommend to anyone interested in the Middle Ages.

But after I looked at it more closely, I realized that it promised to be quite rational and even entertaining.<br />I wasn't disappointed.  &quot;Captured By Aliens&quot; is a pleasure to read, and Achenbach is often very funny.<br />Achenbach is an unapologetic skeptic who explores several strands in what the book's subtitle calls &quot;the search for life and truth in a very large universe&quot;: SETI (the Search for Extraterretrial Intelligence), which looks for radio emissions from other technologically advanced civilizations; the search for life on other planets, including the heated debate about whether the Viking landers or the famous Antarctic meteorite show that there is (or was) life on Mars; the chances of finding intelligent life anywhere besides earth (assuming, for the moment, that you can even find it here); and the heartfelt if wildly inconsistent beliefs of UFO enthusiasts and others who are close to the fringe.<br />The book is also useful as a brief and sometimes moving biography of Carl Sagan, the astronomer and skeptic who wanted very badly to believe but, in the end, found nothing that satisfied his rigorous standards of proof.<br />The only criticism I have of &quot;Captured By Aliens&quot; is that it sometimes reads like a disjointed string of short articles rather than a sustained narrative.  This is not surprising, since several of the chapters appear to have been derived from pieces that were published in magazines.  That being said, this small flaw actually makes the book easier to enjoy in several sittings.<br />If you enjoy authors who examine the lore of aliens with a skeptical wit, you might try David Darlington's &quot;Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles&quot; or Phil Patton's &quot;Dreamland: Travels Inside the Secret World of Roswell and Area 51.&quot;  Darlington and Patton are less conspicuously skeptical than Achenbach, but their books are nonetheless an interesting exploration of a modern mythology.  Sagan's &quot;Pale Blue Dot,&quot; to which Achenbach often refers in his book, is also worth reading for what it has to say about Sagan's views on the search for life in the universe.keptical than Achenbach, but their books are nonetheless an interesting exploration of a modern mythology.

Although some of the authors spin a better story than others, the book as a whole is fairly well written and often quite fascinating.<br />The broad topics addressed include &quot;Myths and Legends,&quot; &quot;Mysteries of the Stone Age,&quot; &quot;Ancient Civilizations,&quot; &quot;Tombs &amp; Lost Treaures,&quot; &quot;The Fall of Civilizations,&quot; and &quot;Ancient &amp; Undeciphered Scripts.&quot;  The last topic is perhaps the most unusual and in some ways the most intriguing--books about ancient mysteries usually focus on ruins rather than on forgotten languages, and this topic broke new ground for me.<br />For those who are looking for ancient astronauts and Atlantis, this book will be a disappointment.  This book is not about the supernatural, but is instead the story of how clever our own ancestors could be when presented with novel problems and opportunities.<br />If you relish the sober exploration of the past, you might also enjoy &quot;Ancient Mysteries,&quot; by Peter James and Nick Thorpe.  It explores more provocative theories and is written in a more lively style than &quot;The Seventy Great Mysteries,&quot; although the illustrations are not as colorful. Other good books in the same genre: David Keys, &quot;Catastrophe&quot;; Hugh Miller, &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; and &quot;More Secrets of the Dead&quot; (available from Amazon's UK store); Pelligrino, &quot;Unearthing Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Return to Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;; and Ryan &amp; Pitman, &quot;Noah's Flood.&quot;	2001-12-01

Despite the title, the book covers a lot of the same ground as conventional histories of the period.  The style, however, is breezy and approachable--there aren't any shocking revelations, but Wright is a capable writer who knows how to tell a good story.<br />Wright is at his best when he talks about television, sports, &quot;culture shock,&quot; and other experiences that tend to be ignored in mainstream history books.  He has a good eye for an amusing story (not a surprising talent for an Emmy-winning television writer), and there are plenty of these sprinkled throughout the book.  For instance, when Secretary of State Dean Rusk commented that the United States had gone &quot;eyeball-to-eyeball&quot; with the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile crisis, Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko replied that &quot;I am looking forward to talking with you balls to balls.&quot;  As Wright points out, it's obvious that a lot was lost in the translation.<br />If you like a lot of rigorous analysis and chronology in your history, this is not the book for you.  Wright reviews the sixties in broad chapters like &quot;TV or Not TV: That is the Message&quot; and &quot;Shots Ring Out: JFK, RFK and MLK.&quot; You may find yourself getting dizzy going from one end of the sixties to the other and then back again--on the other hand, maybe that's just Wright's metaphor for the whole decade.<br />If you are looking for an informative and amusing book that you can enjoy on an airplane, as I did, &quot;What They Didn't Teach You About the 60s&quot; is a good place to start.<br />For those who enjoy this sort of thing, Wright has also written &quot;What They Didn't Teach You About&quot; books for the American Revolution, Civil War, Wild West and World War II.  I've read and enjoyed Wright's book about WWII, and I look forward to reading the rest.	2001-11-27

But It's Worth Reading	&quot;Unsolved Mysteries of Science&quot; is a well-written, interesting survey of twenty-one questions that continue to stump scientists.  The book is pitched toward a reader who is not a scientist but who is curious and rational--no scientific formulas, no charts or graphs, and no UFOs or other pseudoscience.<br />Malone gives each question its own chapter.  He then offers some very helpful and clearly presented background information to frame the question.  He explains what it is the scientists are struggling with--this is the tough part, because it is sometimes hard to articulate exactly what the problem is, especially when the subject is quantum physics.  Each chapter concludes with a good set of suggestions for further reading.<br />Some of the questions are fairly esoteric (&quot;How Did the Universe Begin?&quot;; &quot;How Will the Universe End?&quot;), some may affect the survival of the human species (&quot;What Causes Mass Extinctions?&quot;; &quot;What Causes Ice Ages?&quot;), and some are just plain mind boggling (&quot;Are There Multiple Universes?&quot; &quot;How Many Dimensions Are There?&quot;).  Each chapter is fascinating.<br />My guess is that this book will be fairly &quot;sequel friendly&quot;--I can think of a few other questions that are kicking around out there (for example, &quot;Is There Life Anywhere Else in the Universe?&quot;), and I would be happy to read &quot;More Unsolved Mysteries of Science&quot; someday.<br />If you get a kick out of well-written, rational &quot;mysteries&quot; books (as opposed to &quot;von Danikenesque&quot; drivel), you might also have a look at Paul Aron's &quot;Unsolved Mysteries of American History&quot; and &quot;Unsolved Mysteries of History,&quot; both of which are published by Wiley in the same highly readable and useful format used by Malone's book.	2001-11-27

This book is not heavy-duty history, but Crichton does an elegant job of describing the spirit of the times in America in 1900.<br />Crichton picks out several threads and follows their development throughout the year.  She includes, among other interesting stories, the presidential election between President William McKinley and Democratic challenger William Jennings Bryan; the elevation of a reluctant Teddy Roosevelt to the Vice Presidency; the Boxer Rebellion in China; the blossoming literary career and awkward love life of Jack London; the horrible disasters and living conditions that afflicted coal miners; the miners' first major triumph in a long struggle for fair wages and safe working conditions; the quixotic poltical career of Admiral George Dewey, the hero of Manila Bay; the struggles between financier J.P. Morgan, steel magnate Andrew Carnegie and oil baron John D. Rockefeller; the Paris exposition; the accomplishments of black Americans Scott Joplin, W.E.B. Dubois, and Paul Laurence Dunbar; the cruelty of the South's emerging Jim Crow laws; the military entanglement in the Philippines, which foreshadowed America's later experience in Vietnam; the careful research of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk; and the triumph of Count Zeppelin at Lake Constance.<br />The books is only 305 pages long, and the picture that Crichton paints is somewhat impressionistic.  But her prose is highly readable, and the stories that she tells are very engaging, unfolding like the subplots in a complex novel.  This is a book that can be read quickly and with pleasure in just a couple of sittings.<br />Although 1900 was clearly a vibrant time, Crichton's book will be a tonic for those who pine for the &quot;good old days&quot; that never really happened.  The treatment of workers, blacks, immigrants and others in 1900 was simply appalling.  Conditions became so bad in San Francisco's Chinatown that the bubonic plague broke out, killing 32 people and leading to a federal quarantine of the city.  Living conditions in America in 1900 must have been similar to those in the Third World today, relieved only by hope for a better future.<br />Each chapter of America 1900 ends with a few clippings from contemporary newspapers.  One of the most interesting in light of current events is a March 10, 1900 statement by the Ameer of Afghanistan, who denounced the Russians and proclaimed that &quot;a war with the Afghans would mean a general rising of all Islam . . . . &quot;  Sometimes, it seems, the more things change the more they stay the same.<br />For those interested in how the 19th century turned into the 20th in America, I strongly recommend Volume I of Mark Sullivan's Our Times, which was first published in 1926 and covers the same period as Crichton's book in more detail.tine of the city.

The answers are, of course, administered with bitter sarcasm.<br />&quot;Know It All&quot; is a mellow version of The Straight Dope--some of the sardonic wit remains, but the text has been &quot;dumbed down&quot; to reach younger and less sophisticated readers. (The book even contains pronunciation guides for words that aren't all that difficult.)<br />Having said that, &quot;Know It All&quot; covers the same ground as &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; and does it with the same no nonsense style. Almost all of the questions and answers are adapted from longer, more cynical pieces appearing in the Straight Dope series--which makes me wonder whether Ed Zotti is really just Cecil Adams' editor, or whether Cecil Adams is instead Ed Zotti's pen name. (For his part, Zotti marvels that &quot;people accept unquestioningly that my name is Ed Zotti.&quot;--Triumph of the Straight Dope at 285.)<br />The bottom line is that I enjoyed this book, though it is not as good as the Straight Dope series. The short &quot;question and answer&quot; format make it a perfect &quot;bathroom reader&quot; (for those of you who are inclined to do your reading at single sittings), and it is still entertaining and informative.

US	53064169	R2VFHPR9YIWMKH	0895262509	363170	The Bible Is History	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Through a Glass, Darkly	Ian Wilson is a capable writer, and The Bible is History is a fascinating and balanced account of the historical underpinnings of the Old and New Testaments.<br />Although Wilson readily concedes that he is a believing Christian, he does not take a \\"fundamentalist\\" view of the history of Israel and early Christianity.  For him, the Bible's stories were inspired by real people and events--though the details of what truly happened have been garbled by time, trauma and translation.<br />Wilson describes a number of archaeological finds that support, at least in general terms, the historical accuracy of the Bible.  In his rationalist approach, for example, the Flood happened because of the collapse of a natural, prehistoric dam that separated the Mediterranean from the Black Sea; the fall of Jericho was probably caused by an earthquake; and the rise and fall of the Kingdom of Israel was a product of the power politics of the time.<br />The book is beautifully illustrated, and the author's passion for his subject is palpable.  My only quarrel with The Bible is History is that Wilson allows his faith to carry him off a bit in the last chapter. There, he asserts that if the reader isn't persuaded that Jesus Christ is \\"death-transcending,\\" then \\"both the Bible and this book have been a waste of time and effort.\\"  This is a bit much.  Although I remain agnostic, I found Wilson's book to be well worth reading, and I commend it to both the faithful and the skeptical.<br />For those who enjoy Wilson's work, you might want to know that he will soon release \\"Before the Flood,\\" which will explore the collapse of an ancient, natural dam that gave rise to the Flood legends of the Middle East.  (Ryan & Pittman's Noah's Flood is probably the best treatment to date of this fascinating subject.)	2001-08-19

Keys makes a solid case that a disaster, possibly a huge volcanic eruption, happened sometime around 535 AD.  The aftermath was worldwide drought, floods, famine, plague and the collapse of ancient civilizations around the world.<br />The book seems to be on to something (unlike the silly Chariots of the Gods and its ilk), but there are reasons to be skeptical about the author's conclusions.<br />First, Keys covers a great deal of ground for someone who is described on the book jacket as an &quot;archaeology correspondent&quot; for The Independent, a London daily paper.  He makes a number of important judgments about ancient Chinese, Indonesian, American, British, European and Middle Eastern sources, as well as about geology, meteorology and even physics.  His books suggests that he consulted specialists before drawing his conclusions, but I can't avoid the impression that some of his claims might be hotly disputed by experts in in the relevant field.  In short, it's a little hard for the lay person to judge whether Keys has the qualifications needed to make the judgments upon which his arguments ultimately depend.<br />Second, Keys has a disturbing tendency to use words like &quot;undoubtedly&quot; and &quot;certainly&quot; when describing the ancient world.  I've read a great deal of history, and I have learned that nothing is ever really &quot;certain&quot; or &quot;undoubted,&quot; especially if we're talking about events that happened 1500 years ago.  Rather, such words often reflect an author's uncouncious effort to shore up a weak argument.<br />Finally, Keys gets a little swept away by his thesis, constantly re-asserting that whatever happened in 535 caused (however indirectly) the birth of the modern world.  Perhaps, but the same may be said of many other events that happened before and since.  No need to get carried away--it's quite enough to argue that something exciting happened, that it affected a great many people and cultures, and that the world was changed in interesting (and sometimes frightening) ways.<br />Having said all that, I enjoyed the book, which is why I gave it four stars.  It covers the world history of the early &quot;dark ages&quot; in a crisp and fairly readable style.  The author advances and does a good job of defending an interesting theory about why many civilizations seem to have collapsed (or at least taken a turn for the worse) in the sixth century AD.<br />On the whole, this book reminds me of Charles Pellegrino's Unearthing Atlantis and its sequel, Return to Sodom and Gomorrah, both of which invoke a &quot;catastrophe&quot; (specifically, the eruption of Thera/Santorini) to explain the Atlantis legend and the events described in the Old Testament.  Catastrophe is not, however, in the same league as Ryan &amp; Pitman's Noah's Flood, which relies on what appears to me to be very rigorous science to show that the Flood legend may have its origins in the collapse of a natural dam between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.<br />You'll probably enjoy Catastrophe, but don't be surprised if the experts (for whatever they're worth) roll their eyes when they read and write about this book.that it affected a great many people and cultures, and that the world was changed in interesting (and sometimes frightening) ways.<br />Having said all that, I enjoyed the book, which is why I gave it four stars.

Although I sometimes wondered whether the author might be one of those who is &quot;often in error, but never in doubt,&quot; I didn't see any obvious mistakes.  More to the point, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's style and selection of events.<br />The book is not about the weather as such, so it doesn't discuss the nuances of isobars or storm fronts; rather, it focuses on how the weather has changed the outcome of selected historical events.  Durschmied's new book is thus a continuation of his narrative in &quot;The Hinge Factor.&quot;<br />Among the events the author describes: the destruction of three Roman legions in Teutoberger Wald in AD 9 in the face of a wild thunderstorm; the &quot;divine wind&quot; that destroyed the Mongol invasion fleet in 1281; the destruction of Napoleon's Grand Army in 1812; the Irish potato famine of the 1840s; war in the Alps, 1916-18; the defeat of Hitler's Russian offensive in 1941; and a somewhat surprising reason why the Soviet Union was not willing to use nuclear weapons during the Cuban missile crisis. Durchmied writes with a dramatic skill that brings these events to life.<br />One of the best measures of how much I enjoyed a book is how much I look forward to the next one by the same author.  I noticed that Durchmied's books are published in Europe about a year before they arrive in the United States, so I visited Amazon's UK site to see whether Durschmied had written anything new.  In fact, he has: he just published a new book called &quot;The Whisper of the Blade,&quot; which appears to be a history of revolutions.  I've already ordered it, and I'm looking forward to its arrival here on the other side of the pond.	2001-04-07

Douglas has a lot of interesing things to say, and Olshaker is an excellent writer.  Their collaboration has produced a book that is nearly impossible to put down.<br />The most controversial part of this book will be the last chapter, in which Douglas sets out his views about who killed JonBenet Ramsey.  He will be pounced on by many irate readers who are just absolutely, positively certain that one (or both) of the Ramseys did it--these readers will give the book an undeserved &quot;one star&quot; rating not because the book isn't terrific but because they disagree with Douglas' conclusion.<br />For my part, I found Douglas' defense of the Ramseys to be diplomatic, well-reasoned and persuasive.  After reading Steve Thomas' JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation, I was convinced that the crime was not committed by an intruder.  Douglas made me think twice about that conclusion and has moved me back to sitting on the fence.<br />For those who are ready to hang the Ramseys from the nearest tree, remember that the standard of guilt in America is &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;  The only thing that is &quot;beyond doubt&quot; about the Ramsey murder is that an understandably inexperienced Boulder police department allowed the crime scene to be turned into a world class mess within the first few hours of arriving at the Ramseys' home, thus insuring that, short of a confession, the real killer would never be brought to justice. (Douglas once thought that having a child murdered was the worst thing that could happen to someone; now he believes that the worst thing that could happen to someone is to have a child murdered and be wrongly blamed for it.)<br />And for those who are focused to the point of obsession on the Ramsey murder, Douglas reminds us that 804 other children were murdered in the year JonBenet died.  As Douglas says, those are the cases that should really haunt us.Douglas reminds us that 804 other children were murdered in the year JonBenet died.

The story begins on &quot;the day before&quot; (December 6, 1941), then turns to an hour-by-hour narrative that covers the thoughts and actions of leaders and ordinary people in Tokyo, Washington, London, North Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, Pearl Habor, Manila, the Russian Front and other places. The action builds towards Japan's attacks on British and American positions in the Pacific, giving some sense of the brilliance of Japan's military planning, the racism and unpreparedness of both America and Britain, and the foolhardiness of taking on a country as powerful as the United States.<br />Equally interesting is Weintraub's treatment of the hours that followed the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Many of us remember where we were when JFK was shot, or when Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon, or when the Challenger exploded. For the generation that preceded us, the world was divided into &quot;before Pearl Harbor&quot; and &quot;after Pearl Harbor.&quot; Weintraub describes the reactions of many when they first heard the news.<br />He also discusses at length the inexplicable failure of MacArthur and the American leadership in the Philippines to understand that the war had really begun. Not that the inexcusable loss of American aircraft at Clark Field seems to have affected MacArthur's career--as Weintraub puts it, &quot;few generals have profited so spectacularly from their own failures.&quot;<br />This book brought me as close as any of us Baby Boomers are likely to come to understanding what people around the world were thinking just before and just after America entered World War II.  It is really enjoyable, and I couldn't put it down. If you can find a copy (easier said than done), buy it and read it.	1999-01-11

He and co-author Philip Lerman are the  inspiration behind America's Most Wanted, the Fox television show that has  helped capture over five hundred dangerous criminals.<br />No Mercy tells  several of the most famous stories from America's Most Wanted, all of which  are emotionally wrenching.  The most intriguing is  &quot;The Strange Case  of the Green Parrot,&quot; an incredibly improbable set of circumstances  that sound like a Hollywood script.  I'm not going to give away the ending,  but I will say that this tale alone is worth the price of admission.<br />The  stories in this book are chilling, and they may give you nightmares.  It's  difficult to believe that we share the same planet with monsters who can do  the things that Walsh and Lerner describe. But at the same time, the  authors show that caring people can and should and do fight back.<br />I  confess that I have never watched America's Most Wanted--I prefer books  over television.  But I may begin to watch the program after reading this  book, out of a sense of responsibility if nothing else.  Walsh's efforts  have probably already spared countless hundreds of people from the pain  that he himself had to endure.  The more people who watch his show or read  this book, the more criminals will be caught before they can hurt or kill  again.<br />The book includes information about children who are still  missing, as well as about several fugitives who are still at large--perhaps  some reader will send in the tip that brings these cases to a close.  The  one omission that surprised me was this: as far as I could tell, the book  did not give a web site for America's Most Wanted.  (I looked it up, and it  can be found at amw.com or americasmostwanted.com).  It semes to me that  the Net is the ideal place to post bulletins and updates between airings of  the show, and it would have been useful to put this bit of information in  the book or on the jacket.to me that  the Net is the ideal place to post bulletins and updates between airings of  the show, and it would have been useful to put this bit of information in  the book or on the jacket.	1998-10-24

Most of those are painfully dull.  But Bizarre Beliefs breaks from the pack, looking at everything from alien abductions to spiritualism with good humor and British charm.  Although the authors are skeptics, they are always sensitive to the views of others.  For those who wonder whether there is really anything to astrology, or fire walking, or the curse of Tutankhamun, this book will make you think while it makes you chuckle.	1997-10-15
