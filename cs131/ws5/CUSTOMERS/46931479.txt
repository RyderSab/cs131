I read \\"Travels with Charley,\\" early on in life because my parents swore up and down on his worth as a writer, our family had blazed through California on another memorable family vacation and dropped by Monterey for the express purpose to see where Cannery Row had been set.  So, that's where I'm coming from.  After re-reading \\"Travels with Charley,\\" as an adult, I find it odd that a child would have read the book and enjoyed it.  Well, there is the writing convention of the man and a dog take a journey across the United States Don Quixote style which a child would find appealing but trust me...this is no child's book.<br /><br />I struggled to give this 3 stars, but my expectations run high for any Steinbeck work and this is not his best.  From the one's I have read so far, \\"Travels with Charley\\" is running behind the middle of the pack.  It's a worthwhile read.  Steinbeck sets out from New York in a camper pick-up with his French Poodle Charley and searches out the America he fears he doesn't know any longer.  He finds some wonderful and beautiful things, but also encounters a dark countenance among some of the people which he finds off-putting and sends him to writing off the trip through much of the Southwest and Southeast.  The racism he encounters in the South in 1962 is largely responsible for this feeling that pervades the book, that Americans though approachable and still hopeful, have sides and personalities that are none too redeeming when put to Steinbeck's observations.<br /><br />Rich parts of this book are his observations of people and places.  He loves Wisconsin and finds its beauty a brand new discovery at the age of 59.  He extols the virtues of Montana.  Readers who are interested in Steinbeck's life and influences will find his observations of San Francisco and the Salinas valley quite engaging.  His chapter on Texas and Texans is simply divine wit and I found (having been raised a Texan myself)it rollicking good fun.  His observations are poignant, cutting, and downright funny.  Steinbeck says, \\"When I started this narrative, I knew that sooner or later I would have to have a go at Texas, and I dreaded it.  I could have by-passed Texas about as easily as a space traveler can avoid the Milky Way,\\" and he is just getting started.  You will have to read the rest.  Many of the observations seem to be lifted our of the notes of a Robert Earl Keen or Townes Van Zant song.<br /><br />\\"Travels with Charley,\\" as any Steinbeck works, is a worthwhile read.  But if you are itching to read a top-notch travelogue or wanting to divulge in the best of Steinbeck's works I'd suggest you start elsewhere.<br /><br />--MMWe wit and I found (having been raised a Texan myself)it rollicking good fun.

In fact, this book is obviously a publishable doctoral dissertation clocking in at a scant 152 pages of readable text with the rest covering footnotes and references.  Sure looks like a dissertation to me.<br /><br />Its not that this book is bad, it's just fails to put a face on poverty.  One can read the book and gather big picture analysis of the trend in American poverty and discover fodder for debating the policy issue, but one through reading the book doesn't come to know the poverty-stricken people any better.  To do that through reading would require picking up a copy of \\"The Working Poor,\\" by David Shipler or \\"Getting nickled and dimed in America,\\" by Barbara Ehrenreich.  Iceland's work reaches out to academics and policy-makers and helps them to understand poverty measures, characteristics of the poverty population (through statistics albeit), causes of poverty, and effect of poverty policy.  Though, it's readable I would think it only reaches those who are students of poverty and not to the hearts and minds of the average American.<br /><br />Go elsewhere for engaging books to help you understand the challenges of those living in poverty.  But by all means pick up Iceland's \\"Poverty in America,\\" if you have a term paper to write, are looking for data to back-up policy positions, or need to mine the issue and work in a service field to those in poverty.  Iceland points out that relative poverty thrives in the United States today due to low wages and lack of wise public support programs.  Though we are the land of plenty, many people still suffer, not gaining any benefit of living in a wealthy nation.  It gives cause for thought.<br /><br />--MMW	2005-06-19

With other Pulitzer Prize winning books (like Guns of August) you may ponder, \\"How did this ever win the top prize for literature?,\\" but with \\"Parting the Waters,\\" the answer comes immediately apparent that it is deserving of accolades upon accolades.  An understanding of 20th century America is incomplete without reading Branch's book on the early Civil Rights movement.<br /><br />What Branch does so well is write compelling narrative that leaves the book hard to put down.  He makes a 922 page book seem much much shorter, which reading that length of a book would mostly be a labor of love to finish otherwise.  What he also does brilliantly is to open up the context of the Civil Rights movement to the major events on the world stage and developments of the time.  Instead of looking at the Civil Rights movement under a microscope, Branch brings in the Cuban Missile Crisis, popular culture, and so much more to help frame those events and that time.<br /><br />It is hard to understand the amount of hatred in parts of our country during that time but Branch's book brings it out in shockingly brutal details.  To understand what our country went through a scant half century ago, helps illuminate race relations today.  We owe a great debt to the leaders of the civil rights movement for being extremely brave, many times to the point of giving their lives, to bring about needed social change in America.  After reading Branch's account of the beginning of the Civil Rights movement, it struck me that those years were nothing short of a war, a revolution, fought through peaceful means against all odds.<br /><br />The reading of this book will leave you changed, liberal and conservative alike.  It has reached elevated status of my all time favorite book list...and I have read a few.  Everyone should read this book in a lifetime.<br /><br />--MMW	2005-05-18

The sheer improbability of a trip in between those two points on the globe points to the sheer improbability of enjoying a book on Italian Football written by an American who hadn't grown up with the game...but enjoy it I did.<br /><br />McGinniss' book follows the season of Castel di Sangro, a lowly Ambruzzo mountain town football team, just after their meteoric rise from the lowest league in Italian football to Serie B, the second to highest league.  What we get from McGinniss is an impassioned man discovering a fanatical passion late in life for something so foreign to Americans as Italian football.  It is perhaps a good thing he didn't discover instead Cricket or Afghanistan Goat-head polo as those sports might have been a bridge too far.  The writing is quite engaging, the prose fluid, the language keeps you reading...for that the book scores.<br /><br />Through McGinniss' book we get an outsiders inside look at an Italian village and how the lives of those villagers are intertwined with their soccer team.  Some find McGinness' opinionated strong-arm-isms to be off-putting and indeed they can be, but that doesn't really stop one from reading the story.  I followed along to the end and McGinniss lost me at that point where he risks going along to the gravesides of former Castel players with the rest of his team due to a fix on the last game of the season.  For some reason McGinniss regards this Italian \\"way of the game\\" through American lens as equates the action equivalent to Judas Iscariot or Benedict Arnold.  It seems a wholly \\"ugly American-esque\\" way to view the way of the other and most readers will find it off-putting.<br /><br />Don't let these detractors steer you away from this book.  After reading it you will find yourself catching a little of the Calcio fever and wondering what ever happened to those players and how Castel di Sangro is doing now.  That's a testament to the writer's ability to capture the spirit of Italian Calcio fandom.<br /><br />--MMWappened to those players and how Castel di Sangro is doing now.

Having that reputation to live up to may have hurt my estimation of this book.  I expected the history to come off the page and envelop me in a world gone mad with war and Nationalism.  What I feel I got was a better than average history read that helped me to understand the start of World War I but didn't necessarily immerse myself in dredging up the experience to stick it to the bones of my brain.  I wasn't immersed like expected.<br /><br />What I truly liked about this book...the Generals come alive with their follies and foibles, their selfish desires and selflessness, their bravery and cowardice, their dashing elan that results in so many deaths.  Tuchman paints an seemingly inevitable turn of tides rolling towards chaos.  The Schlieffen plan has been set into motion and it seems nothing can hold it back to roll down the Belgian countryside steaming the Allemande juggernaut of divisions and reserves down on Paris.  The decision points are revealed and the things counted on and discounted along the way reveal human beings making mistakes and heroic stands that hold the death of one century and the birth of another.<br /><br />Tuchman makes heroes and goats of the major players and I suspect the reality of their personality and roles may be a bit more multi-dimensional than is made out to be.  King Albert of Belgium is the hero standing up to the Germans by committing his country to a disasterous but strategically important defeat.  Sir John French of Britain despite his name worked terribly with the French and is portrayed as a fearful stumbling block to any cohesive allied effort, Joffre is a rock (sometimes as dumb as one but a rock nonetheless), and Gallieni the defender of Paris arises as the hero for urging an attack upon an opportune moment presented by Von Moltke's mistake and underestimation of the French Army.  So this was a strength of the book.<br /><br />The book surprisingly gets bogged down in the countless retelling of details of which numbered division went where during battles and the retreat.  It's suprising at a time when World War I actually involved movement.  After all it wasn't much later until it truly got bogged down in trench warfare.  Perhaps Tuchman's style is a window of what's to come.  It reads more as a technical retelling at points instead of a vibrant history.  If you are interested in history, don't let this detractor cause you to pass this one up.  \\"The Guns of August,\\" is an important retelling of history however not one of the most engaging ones.

The actual events, or the memories and perceptions of events, that threaded together become the weave of a life take on weight of epic relativity.  It is that which elevates the mundane to significance.  It is that which gives our lives meaning.<br /><br />I say this because Jonathan Safran Foer has woven a tale that rises above the fray in \\"Everything is Illuminated.\\"  His age, a scant 24, tells me there is quite a reservoir of latent talent.  He doesn't have the years to go through the endless molding of writing schools.  There is a hint of the Mozart boy genius.<br /><br />Foer has managed to elevate life events to myth in \\"Everything is Illuminated.\\"  It is a beautiful tapestry of a Ukrainian village, or shetl, in which magical things happen to magical people.  The main character, a young American Jew, goes on a spirit hunt to reconnect himself with his ancestral heritage in Eastern Europe.  He does this through a cast of characters to include a Ukrainian youth, who himself is unknowingly coming to an awakening, a crotchety grandfather, and a flatulent horny aged dog named Sammy Davis Junior, Junior.  They go in search of unraveling the past of a now all but forgotten and extinct Ukranian village named Trachimbrod.  Through the journey they are confronted with themselves and a spiritual awakening is realized.<br /><br />If I had to categorize this book it would be elements of Heller's Catch-22, James Joyce, Marquez' One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Weisel's Night with a little David Sedaris thrown in the mix.  Granted that's lofty company and the book most likely won't stand up over time to that crowd, but Safran Foer is to be watched and his language and gift is to be relished.  If a weakness of the book needs to be identified, the characters sometimes become muddled leaving the reader wondering who is who and what exactly happened to them along the way.<br /><br />\\"Everything Is Illuminated,\\" stands as one of my more recent faves and I am thankful for the brother in Texas that knows me well enough to send it my way.<br /><br />--MMWexactly happened to them along the way.   <br /> <br />\\"Everything Is Illuminated,\\" stands as one of my more recent faves and I am thankful for the brother in Texas that knows me well enough to send it my way. <br />--MMW	2005-01-21

After all they aren't victims...the American Dream is that people can pull themselves up by the bootstraps and with enough gumption and verve the plight of poverty can easily be broken if there is enough desire.<br /><br />Shipler's book proves that is not the case.  By getting into the fabric of the lives of the working poor who have given the American Dream a shot but found that dream has failed them, Shipler gives us an insider's eye to the dynamic multi-facted issues behind poverty.  To break the cycle often-times requires that the planets are aligned, life must be just so, Murphy's Law needs to be suspended for a time.  Shipler shows that the minimum wage is not a livable wage.  Payday loans and tax return companies are wolves in wolves clothing.  They take advantage of the people who can least afford to be taken advantage of...those that are in financial crisis to begin with.<br /><br />Shipler, who had such success telling the personal side of things in \\"The Arab and the Jew,\\" is in good form taking on the issue of poverty in \\"The Working Poor.\\"  As a measure of how a society is to be judges, one should look at how the poor and how children are treated.  When we are viewed in history's eye, I wonder how we will be judged.<br /><br />We can hear the message of David Shipler in this book and listen and listen hard.

He found a way to mix philosophy with everyday banalities with seemingly random events with an obsession for the intriguing other with history with surreal characters popping in and out of multiple threaded stories.  I have moved on but not moved from the opinion that Kundera is a great writer.  The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a book I've recently returned to and this is what I found.<br /><br />I have read the majority of Kundera's works and find that though he is best known for \\"The Unbearable Lightness,\\" it is not his best works.  The story is intriguing and you will found yourself twisted into the lives of Tereza and Tomas, Franz and Sabina, and the St. Bernard Karenin.  A few of Kundera's philosophical detours didn't hold me as the reader rapt and the writing space could have been better served expanded on some of the more relevant thinking threads throughout the book.  The writing is quite adept, the chapters broken up into 2-5 page vignettes which keep the book moving and make it a perfect one to read aloud with a significant other.  You find yourself getting in the skin, heart, soul, and head of Tereza and Tomas.  When you find yourself there, you find one can't escape the inescapable pull of attraction between two people regardless of circumstance regardless of will regardless of the balance or imbalance of heaviness or lightness in your relative world.<br /><br />Don't miss reading Kundera's \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\\"  If you aren't thoroughly impressed with the writing style it will make you think and feel just a little more for just a little while.<br /><br />--MMW	2005-01-08

The book is a wonderful telling of the grassroots movement of Head Start and how it gained public support at the highest levels of the government.  The beautiful thing about the book is it is a first-hand account told from one of the program designers, Ed Zigler who has interacted with each administration and congress since 1965 in shepherding the program to its crucial and critical place serving society today.<br /><br />The only critique of the book is the writing style can sometimes come across as slightly dry so it's more of a study instead of a page turner.  But the reading effort is worth the study, since the book tells why Head Start has become a model for public education in its comprehensive family-centered approach to the education of children and parents.  The last 40-odd pages are alone worth the price of the book.  In chapter 10, \\"Head Start:  The Next Generation,\\" Zigler gives a prescient telling of where Head Start stands today and levels prescriptive recommendations towards where Head Start should go from here.<br /><br />These are words from one of the founders and should be heeded as smart public policy, because so much Zigler has touched in the program has turned to gold, enriched the quality of life of low-income children and by such benefiting society at large.

Sister Souljah deserves a lot of recognition for making a point in the vein of Malcom X and Richard Wright's \\"Native Son.\\"  To break the cycle of negative consequence, it takes some tough choices; choices seemingly unglamorous but in the interest of greater humanity necessary.<br /><br />To tip my hand, reading this book was a stretch for me.  I was recommended this book by a young African-American single Mom colleague as one of the best books she has read.

So, she read Catch 22 and I read \\"The Coldest Winter Ever.\\"  I'm not sure how much she got out of her reading assignment but Souljah's book was a mind-broadening experience.<br /><br />The tale of Winter Santiago, daughter of a successful gang lord drug dealer, is one of a young adult, street-wise beyond her years moving from having her known world at her fingers to one of survival and destitution is a cautionary tale of the choices we make and the consequences we learn to live with.  Winter, though a sympathetic character, makes cold choices that in her mind will lead to things in life she considers important...money, clothes, control, possessions.  Sister Souljah has a way of weaving the reader into the tale without being heavy-handed with the message she speaks to.<br /><br />Usually the aspect of literature that draws me in is the writing, and I believe with this book Souljah was still trying to find her voice as a writer.  Some of the language comes off as hackneyed and still yearns to be peppered with originality.  All is forgiven though as Souljah displays other strengths in a writer's bag of tricks such as characterization and plot.<br /><br />Recommend \\"The Coldest Winter Ever,\\" to a young adult struggling with difficult choices in life on the streets.

If you work in an environment that requires you to work collaboratively, this book is a must.<br /><br />Maurer truly takes a practical approach to the rare skill of collaboration of ideas.  He starts by exploring different levels of resistance and how much a serious barrier to collaboration those levels can be.  Next, he explores six steps for engagement with the central principle that true active listening can make all the difference.  Maurer concludes by expanding these ideas and concepts beyond the mere world of work to the family.<br /><br />This book really hit home with me.  I'm a Director of a non-profit agency and in my work the skills of collaboration are critical and integral in working with constituents to moving towards a common goal and in a common direction.

I have to say I didn't expect Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" to catch me the way it did.  The themes Steinbeck struggles with are epic--the relationship of men within the family, good and evil, human nature.  Critics derided the novel when it came out and it may have left Steinbeck struggling to write in his waning years, but the Nobel prize he received shortly after \\"East of Eden's\\" release was truly deserving.  Truly deserving because of the work of \\"East of Eden,\\" and not despite it.<br />I read the wonderful and incomparable biography \\"John Steinbeck, Writer,\\" by Jackson J. Benson before tackling \\"East of Eden,\\" and it tainted my expectations.  Some criticisms of the novel I found initially true.  Steinbeck seems to be more straightforward and writes more of what's on his mind instead of letting the story and characters breathe these things naturally.  At some point in the novel that approach strikes me as breaking the novelist dictum of, \\"show don't tell.\\"  Steinbeck does a lot of telling.  Surprisingly enough, in the end, this slight misstep strengthens the overall story.  It puts you in the mind of Steinbeck and allows the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the dark dark nature of some of \\"East of Eden's\\" characters.<br />Steinbeck always tended to have a dark side, but \\"East of Eden,\\" is a stark look at the underbelly of humanity.  However, while we are looking at the underbelly of a seemingly upright community of Salinas, we also see that humanity is redeeming.  Some of the very incomprehensible evil within a person is matching by a boundless capacity for good.  How can that be?  This is why Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" surpasses the better known and wider read, \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"  Steinbeck seems to accept human nature and not sugar coat.  He tells it like it is.<br />Steinbeck struggled and struggled to write and finish \\"East of Eden.\\"  The scope of what he was trying to attempt was extremely daunting...almost debilitatingly so.  Steinbeck tried to retell the story of \\"Genesis,\\" set in his hometown of Salinas...drawing from his own life, the town's life, the times between the Civil War and World War I.  He pulls it off with quite some characters...Adam Trask and his twin sons Caleb and Aron, their mother--the completely evil Cathy/Cat/Kate, Adam's evenly evil and good brother Charles, the sage Chinese Lee, and the beautiful of mind, body, and spirit love interest of no less than Caleb, Aron, and Lee...Abra.  I think to call, \\"East of Eden,\\" lacking in story and characters is severely missing the mark.  Another criticism of the book is that the Chinese character of Lee is a racial stereotype.  I didn't find this to be the case.  Lee seems to be a multi-dimensional character that if anything deepens the understanding that his ethnicity takes a back seat to his humanity.  Another criticism is that the character Kate is too evil...to the point of dehumanization.  Steinbeck's portrayal of Kate may have roots in his failed relationships but it does not come across as misogynistic.  He balances this out with other female characters, such as Abra, that have capacity for the gamut of human characteristics.  Kate's portrayal of evil makes the character more real...more frightening...and indicative of human evil that, regardless of philosophy, tends to surface from time to time.<br />In my mind, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row,\\" still stands out as his best (at least among his works I've read so far), but \\"East of Eden,\\" solidifies his place among a very short list of greatest American authors.  It is a work deserving of a Nobel Prize for literature...damn the critics to say what they will.<br />--MMWso.

I think to call, \\"East of Eden,\\" lacking in story and characters is severely missing the mark.  Another criticism of the book is that the Chinese character of Lee is a racial stereotype.  I didn't find this to be the case.  Lee seems to be a multi-dimensional character that if anything deepens the understanding that his ethnicity takes a back seat to his humanity.  Another criticism is that the character Kate is too evil...to the point of dehumanization.  Steinbeck's portrayal of Kate may have roots in his failed relationships but it does not come across as misogynistic.  He balances this out with other female characters, such as Abra, that have capacity for the gamut of human characteristics.  Kate's portrayal of evil makes the character more real...more frightening...and indicative of human evil that, regardless of philosophy, tends to surface from time to time.<br />In my mind, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row,\\" still stands out as his best (at least among his works I've read so far), but \\"East of Eden,\\" solidifies his place among a very short list of greatest American authors.  It is a work deserving of a Nobel Prize for literature...damn the critics to say what they will.<BR>--MMW	2004-07-11

I found Kathryn Spink's \\"Mother Teresa:  A Complete Authorized Biography\\" left wanting.  It did not live up to the magnitude of Mother Teresa's life of service and giving throughout the world but especially in India's Calcutta in the formation and running of the Sisters of Charity.<br />Spink's \\"Mother Teresa,\\" reads, at times, like a laundry list of events with no coherent effort made to illuminate the person behind the events.  The best biographies I have found don't rely so much on the cold hard history to build a story around, but rather insight as to who the person is and how they interacted with the world.  I think of skillfully told biographies in which I walked away from the reading of them with insight, motivation, and the feeling that I knew the subject and was engaged in their life.  Benson's \\"John Steinbeck: Writer,\\" and Morris \\"Theodore Rex,\\" come to mind as examples.  Spink's \\"Mother Teresa,\\" does not do the same.<br />I credit the writer for tackling some tough issues in the last two chapters.  She addresses criticisms of Mother Teresa and the Sister's of Charity co-workers and does so without sidestepping difficult points of contention.  Some social work critics fault the work of Mother Teresa for not wielding her influence to address the root causes of poverty and only tackling the end-product of suffering in a simplistic manner.  In addition, Mother Teresa was loyal to the Catholic Church and stood staunch in support of difficult traditional stances espoused by that organization to include pro-life in all cases.  Spink's does a good job of pitting Mother Teresa's perspective of service and belief to explain why she did what she did and why she believed as she did.  However, this isn't until the last two chapters of the book and this illuminating approach could have been begun on page 1.<br />All in all, I would only recommend this book if you are attempting to delve deeply into the life and times of Mother Teresa and have read other books on that subject.  If you want a good read and are just scratching the surface finding out what Mother Teresa's life was all about, look elsewhere dear reader.<br />--MMWtempting to delve deeply into the life and times of Mother Teresa and have read other books on that subject.

Well let me clarify that, Charles Dickens was fairly dead before this book was written and had he been alive, he may or may not had the desire to pick Roth's \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\", so let me qualify.  Hearing the glowing reviews and seeing the listmania lists placing Roth's \\"Complaint\\" as a must read had me fairly in a frenzy to read this one.  Does it stand out as a truly unique must-read from all the more than mediocre literature out there?  I don't think so.  That's not to say it has achieved mediocrity, it is somewhat above that.<br />What a reader gets from \\"Portnoy's Complaint,\\" is a window inside the psyche of a Jewish American boy come boy-man smothered by a truly overbearing mother and plagues throughout life by a sexual obsession that keeps him from being committed to a human relationship.  His commitments seem to be centered around desires emanating somewhere about his mid-region and early on seem to be mostly of the self-satisfactory kind.  This translates into adulthood to a dogged pursuit of shallow relationships with WASP-ish women.  So, there is plenty of Freud infused throughout.  And interestingly enough it transmogrifies into Jung, with Alexander Portnoy grasping the collective unconscious of his Jewish ethnicity getting back at the established American gentility through sex.  If any of this makes you squeamish, you may want to steer clear.<br />It was a book that definitely pushed the boundaries of the time in the 1960's but then again there was a whole cultural movement all about pushing the boundaries back then.  However, like most boundary pushers of the times, we seemed to have lowered our tolerance for the racy and compared to literature today of the same ilk, Portnoy is fairly tame.<br />Do you have to be Jewish to really \\"get\\" this book?  Well, I'm not and there was probably 10% of the book that went right over or around my head.  Yiddish references were completely lost on me, but through repeat word usage most readers can probably get the gist.  Portnoy's is kind of like a mix of Woody Allen and Henry Miller.  It's short and written with an inner voice of a psychotherapy recipient spewing forth from the coach of self-analysis.  It's a good piece of literature, but I'm not so sure about a great one.  Read this is you are interested in what it may be like to be a Jewish-American man growing up in an oppressive family atmosphere.  Read this if you want a good chuckle at sometimes raunchy but talented writing.  If these things don't appeal to you at this time, move on to other reads on your list of literary desires.<br />--MMWe, but through repeat word usage most readers can probably get the gist.

Let that not daunt you, it's one of the finest textbooks I've had...and I've had a few.<br />If your job requires you to work with children with disabilities, oversee programs that work with children with disabilities, or if you are a parent with a child with a disability I would highly recommend this book.  It's the single best overview of the big three laws concerning disabilities, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), American with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  If you are an administrator you can use the text to inform you and guide you in your work.  If you are a parent you can use the text to let you know what your rights are to securing Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) for a child with a disability.<br />You can tell by the set-up and structure of the book that Dixie Snow Huefner took painstaking care to make the book student-friendly.  There are ample margins for good note-taking right in the book.  Each chapter has a wonderful review summation of the key points (perfect for working professional graduate students that may not have time to digest the Full Monty reading of the entire chapter).  Also, there is a great acronym glossary that helps you make sense of the alphabet soup abbreviations of the world of special education law.<br />I really can not say enough good things about this book whether you pick it up as a textbook or to be better informed.<br />--MMW	2004-04-01

Idaho has poetry as well as potatoes.  And good reading it does make.<br />Ronald McFarland and William Studebaker have made themselves some names among the Idaho literati set, but beyond those bounds and borders, I'm not sure how many folks have heard of the poesy-makers.  Idaho has it's literary connections. Ernest Hemingway is buried here.  Hemingway did some writing here.  Allen Ginsberg has crossed the great state a time or two and has written about it.  Ezra Pound, politics excepting, was a son of the state born in Hailey.  What do you know, the state, though largely unknown, is on the literary map.  \\"Idaho's Poetry, A Centennial Anthology,\\" speaks to that fact.  It is a rich and varied collection of some really good and in spots great poetry.<br />This book is arranged chronologically starting with the Native American poetry of the Nez Perce, Shoshone and Bannock, Coeur d'Alene, and Kutenai.  You have to hand it to the editors of McFarland and Studebaker for the thoroughness of their project scope.  And the words, rhymes, and language continue on from the Pioneer Poets of the 1860's on to the present contemporaries with each era well and equitably represented.  Notable stand-outs for me and my taste in poetry are Margeret Aho's \\"Carpal Bones,\\" Richard Ardinger's \\"Report from More's Creek,\\" Alex Kuo's \\"A Chinaman's Change Shanghai, 1945,\\" and certainly not to be overlooked is Ron McFarland's own, \\"Orgy,\\" and Ford Swetnam's \\"One Winter,\\" and \\"Another Winter.\\"<br />Like the land and it's poetry, their natural edge serrated rock have had a definite effect on my own writing.

Napier and Whitaker take the approach that 12-year old daughter is having some issues, then bring the whole family in and conduct therapy on them as a family.  The problems of the individual are so deeply intertwined with the problems of the family.<br />Napier and Whitaker do a bang-up job at presenting the material.  This could have easily been a book of boredom filled with psycho-babble dry academic lifeless trifle, but no, it's not.  Instead &quot;The Family Crucible,&quot; makes the point of family therapy by telling a story, an extended case study.  We follow along with the family of five as they show how one member's problems is related to the family.  The therapy shifts from daughter to son to parent-interaction with daughter and son, and finally the couple's marriage that really is at the heart of the issue.  The good docs even go so far as to call in the grandparents to get at some real issues the family is dealing with.<br />You begin to care about this family seemingly as much as Napier and Whitaker do, and you want the best for them.  Along the way, the authors share their poignant view on family dynamics and also, somewhere along the way...there's a reader epiphany.  There's the oh, there's the yes, there's the &quot;that explains it.&quot;  In our ever growing quest here on this earth to live together and understand humanity and the humanity we call family and live with day to day, this book goes miles beyond any expectation.<br />Get your hands on, &quot;The Family Crucible,&quot; and talk with your family about it.

Rowling's second book in the Harry Potter series steps it up a notch.  The writing is more engaging for mixed age audiences, meaning it's the perfect book to read aloud together as a family.  In addition, the plot has a gripping effect that mere magic alone can't account for.  Yes, it's the creative muse that drives this one along, and Rowling has done a smashing job this time.<br />In \\"Chamber of Secrets,\\" we are introduced to new and engaging characters.  There's Gilderoy Lockhart, the guest wizard of the dark arts that is neither to dark or too wizardly, but boy does this guy love himself.  There's Dobby the house elf that despite the comic relief reminds this reader too much of the annoying character in the Star War prequels...you know that tall goofy guy with floppy ears and a Jamaican accent.  Well, the colloquial house elf dialouge is only a minor misstep but I'm sure to be riotous fun for the young and younger at heart.  There's Moaning Myrtle who inhabits and haunts a defunct toilet.  And best of all there's a new villain lurking about whispering dark dark things through the walls of Hogwarts.<br />Harry Potter is more nuanced between a battle of good and evil.  And like all good battles between the polarized moral compass, we see shades of black and white, and marker lines that find you pitched on one side or the other.  Harry Potter captures all that is magical, quirky, and wondrous in childhood and Rowling's writing reaches out to all ages to remind them of that time.  She does so, in such a way, that the pages keep turning effortlessly and before you know it, you've reached a temporary end; satisfied and entertainingly chilled.	2003-12-30

I had always been off put by the title, &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&quot;  To me it always slightly scented of manipulation, the effortful practiced skill of acting in such a way  to &quot;win&quot; over friends as if they didn't come naturally and the people-pawned language of the word, &quot;influence.&quot;  A more apropos title might be, &quot;The Art of Living.&quot;<br />Many of the ideas are echoed years later in Steven Covey's, &quot;7 Habits of Highly Successful People,&quot; for good reason...they are timeless.  The concept of valuing humanity never turns with the times.  Carnegie engagingly reminds us of the power of a name and the importance to work on knowing and using another's name.  He speaks of listening, showing genuine interest in what another has to say, argument avoidance, showing sincere appreciation, and does so in easy to remember and practiceable dictums.<br />It's a book to be read, a book to be practiced, a book to be given.  It's a book that keeps on giving, a book that makes you more human and in such a way you'll find yourself as an afterthought gaining friends and keeping company with people wonderful people.	2003-09-30

He makes blue collar blackened river Ohio come alive riven death with darkness and life.  So this book is a must for poetry lovers.<br />Where it distracts me is the attempts at completeness is a difficult editor's dilemma and one that doesn't serve the poet or the poet's reader well here.  There are two James Wright's out there (this book presents three), as is true with most sublimated artist that pass through a learning phase before hitting on their voice, their style.<br />James Wright started as a formalist (not my favored style) hailing structure and rhyme sometimes at the expense of meaning and language (disclaimer...one man's humble opinion belies a personal taste and no two taste buds seem the same).  The book of course being a complete work, offers all of those poems of bandied prose.  And then the editor offers a bridge or break of sorts in Wright's translated works of German and Spanish poets.  Wright was a great poet in English, but the gift of gifted translation should have been left to the likes of W.S. Merwin, Anthony Kerrigan, Charles Tomlinson, and Stephen Mitchell for Neruda, Paz, and Rilke.<br />So, Wright's &quot;Above the River,&quot; really first breaks the surface on page 119 after his epiphany to all thing free form.  It is then that his poetry sings darkly.  I leave you with some of Wright's beautiful language (there's plenty to be had).  Buy the book for the rest.<br />In Fear of Harvests<br />It has happened<br />Before: nearby,<br />The nostrils of slow horses<br />Breathe evenly,<br />And the brown bees drag their high garlands,<br />Heavily,<br />Toward hives of snow.	2003-09-30

In the end, I'm not really sure what this book does for you?  It seems that Barker keeps the language annoyingly ultra-simplistic while trying to present the paradigm philosophy by repeating the word paradigm as much as can be linguistically saturated in the holdings of 211 pages.<br />Barker's concept that the most difficult problems in business are waiting for someone to come around and break all the rules and infuse new life into an organization and rewrite the procedural bible.  And as soon as that is running smooth, a new paradigm is up for the offing.  Along the way Barker even comes up with his own paradigm for the paragraph with these scant gems (mind you they are complete paragraphs)--<br />&quot;It won't work that way next time around.&quot;<br />and the ever-succinct--<br />&quot;The answer--Switzerland.&quot;<br />While he is busy rewriting the rules of English composition, Barker takes the time to hail the Japanese TQM revolution economic miracle and the eventual dominance of paradigm breaking e-publishing.  The Asian market turned out to be not necessarily infallible and I can't remember the last time I wanted to read an entire book on a computer screen or LED screen.  But such is the hazards of a futurist, that your future predictions can be steam-rolled ten years down the line by armchair pundits gazing through 20-20 hindsight binocs.  It's not fair, but a warning is out there Barker's book is dated.<br />The ideas are good and well enough...don't turn a blind eye to innovation, seek out the voice in the wilderness, listen to outsiders, quality, quality, quality.  But there are timeless books like Robert Pirsig's, &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,&quot; that do much the same but cry out with skill and art through the lens of a story.  Barker's work is thinnish, wanting for the meat and potatoes and grist of a bright idea worded well.ded well.	2003-09-30

There are chapters on landscape planning, plant care, gear, buying tips, annuals, perennials, vegetables, herbs, fruits, bulbs, roses, lawns and ground covers, vines, shrubs, trees, wildflowers, and even house plants.  Whew...that was a list.  Though it would seem with such an exhaustive table of contents that maybe the gardening reader would get to know far too little about a lot, such is not the case.  Once you are done reading trees per say, you feel like you got a fairly thorough branching of the woody subject.<br />Though, if you are solely interested in vegetable gardening let's say, there are more detailed and exhaustive books out there, but chances are someday you will tire of rhubarbs and radishes and get the thorny point to plant a rose or two, you will find on that piercing day that you pine to have bought Damrosch's green bible.<br />I reach for this book time and time again with dirt-caked hands.

This one's a thriller jacketed in a web of art history, age-old religious mystery, and who-dunnit Alfred Hitchcockery.  The writing is simplistic and definitely doesn't get in the way of turning the pages.  Which works well for those feeding on the thrill, but less well for those thrilled by the well-turned phrase.  But the world needs summer beach books, rainy weekenders, and lazy fall leaves turning pages on the metro.  Literary high art it's not, this we've established, but the world has it's place for, \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" and it's a rather entertaining place at that.<br />The character names are pure genre and comically laughable...there's Sophie Neveau the brainy damsel in distress, there's Robert Langdon/Indiana Jones/Jack Ryan as the American in the middle of it all, and there's even Leigh Teabing as the eccentric rich British Knight Historian to add color.  The strength of this book really is Dan Brown's religious conspiracy theory modeling behind a thriller with codes and puzzles.  It's a fetching formula that hasn't been very often previously postured in other thrillers.<br />Brown does fringe the line of pseudo-intellectualism gone bad though as he references current cultural fare to prove a point...Kubrik's \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" proves secret society sex rituals among other modern movies.  It detracts from the purloined pace like a badly placed intermission.<br />Don't let these minor critiques put you off though.  I thoroughly enjoyed Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" and it kept me engaged from beginning to end.  Do you have a Eurorail pass?  This might make perfect reading on the night train from Florence to Rome.	2003-09-04

Which maybe a good thing to say about a 96 ounce steak, is not always a redeemable trait for literature.  We want our casual readings to come easy, to whisk-fully be enjoyed, to turn the last page and say...why I had no idea this book was 780 pages.  Such was not the case with Edmund Morris' &quot;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,&quot;...with this reader at least.<br />Morris does much to deify Teddy.  And granted TR was a remarkable man with no equal in energy, drive, tenacity, and a touch of the silver spoon.  However, Morris kneels down at the altar with bowed head so frequently that I'm afraid he missed a critical look at some of TR's faults.  Leading up to the Spanish-American War over Cuban independence, Teddy was absolutely itching for a fight.  Hell-bent on Jingoism, little is said critical of this war at all cost lust.  Instead TR is credited for bringing the nation to war with scant a nod at diplomacy, and is made a demagogue in the American bellicose heart prevailing at that time.  A great man would have pursued peace going unwantingly into war if necessary.<br />In Morris' deification of TR, some of Teddy's slightly racist views are inattentively glossed over.  It can be written off with the statement that those viewpoints were prevalent at the time, but then the Earth being the center of the universe was prevalent during Galileo's time.  Not that Teddy was one to go against the grain when needed, but in his earlier days, Teddy got the race issue wrong and little is made of it from Morris.<br />It's not all bad.  I did give this one 4-stars after all.  The reading is engaging along the way.  It holds interest, but 780 pages worth is difficult to persistently sustain enthralled engagement.  Morris loves Teddy and it shows.  As in Cameron's &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; the young Rolling Stone writer gets the advice, &quot;You can't be a fan and write on a band at the same time,&quot; so do we miss out I fear on the critical fisheye lens look at Teddy Roosevelt in this book.

Yes, that's right our family is just now getting around to reading the Potter series and what a better place to begin than the beginning with \\"The Sorcerer's Stone.\\"<br />You'd have to be living under an enchanted rock to not be familiar with the plot, so I won't touch on that too much.  Let's give credit to J.K. Rowling for writing a fine tale.  This book is a rarity of rarities, a in-betweener...in-between the world of adults and kids, enchanting to all on the edges and in-between years.  For that, the plot drives you to listen and read on.  The writing, in and of itself, is nothing elevated.  It is not for the turn of phrase or the magical metaphor we read Potter.  No, it's the suspense, the drama, the otherworld-ness of wizards and witches and ogres and goblins and ghosts.<br />Though this book of the series stopped short of the five star rating for me, I highly suspect the following ones will get me there.  I look forward to being enchanted with number two and then three and four...five now...will there be more?  In comparison with J.R.R. Tolkien, this Potter book doesn't quite hold up, but the fact that it compares says a lot.  Not to be missed.  Family reading aloud by the fire.	2003-07-23

You may find yourself saying the same thing too I you should so choose to tackle Schmidt's lengthy analysis on the history of English poetry.  With that statement I suppose is the warning.  Reading this book from cover to cover is probably not for the average reader.  You have to really love poetry and not just the language but what goes into it, what resides behind the words in the fabric of each poet's life.  The book is not without merit though for the casual poetry semi-enthusiast.  It is also a pretty enjoyable read for quick bite analysis.  Pick it up, turn to an era, poet, or genre, and away you go for a quick 10-15 minute before going to sleep read.  I was reluctant to give this book 4 stars tending towards a lower rating due to the weightiness, but the fact that I made it through speaks to the entertaining value of Schmidt's writing.  To make literary analysis readable is no small feat.<br />Michael Schmidt is not without opinions.  You may find yourself vehemently in disagreeance or enthusiastically joining the choir and singing along.  For instance, Schmidt pretty much holds low opinion of the likes of Alan Ginsburg and his use of mind altering drugs to create poetry with little form.  \\"Ginsburg dropped on American poetry like a bomb; his generation outgrew him and American poetry has outgrown him.\\"  It's not so much that Schmidt has an opinion.  Of literary criticism, that is to be expected.  But instead, it is that Schmidt offers up his opinions as imperatives, absolutes not to be countered.<br />Reading Schmidt's book it's as if all of English poetry revolves around Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.  He is downright ebullient in his praises of the two.  \\"After Pound we read poetry differently.\\"  and \\"In The Waste Land he demanded to be read differently from other poets.  He alters our way of reading for good, if we read him properly.\\"  And so it goes in Schmidt's world poetic view of the ushering in of modernism.  Elsewhere, Schmidt decries the loss of formal verse or at least verse that respects formalism.  It is here that he finds the true poet's art.  Again an opinion presented as an imperative.<br />Schmidt is in need of conciseness.  He is self-critical is his choosing of format biting off too much swallowing too little.  He spends precious pages to launch campaigns for regional poets, virtual unknowns, and underappreciates.  These are pages, he could be spending making a case for his St. Eliot and St. Pound sainthood.  If a poet caters to a specific culture with a specific language virtually unintelligible to the rest of the English speaking world, why be inclusive?  Toss 'em out and save 'em for the regional anthologies.  Sorry about the preceding colloquial language, friends.<br />With all this criticism, Schmidt's massive book is a treasure for poetry lovers.  It is high brow in places, but when you finish reading the whole thing or just bits and pieces you will know more about poetry, appreciate more in depth poetry, and be indebted to the history and love of language that precedes us and will succeed us.

The moral is good telling of unconditional love between Large (Mom Fox...but please don't call the real world mother that after shipping the boy off to bed and returning to your own bed...it won't be a happy household on the whole if you know what I mean) and Small (Toddler Fox).  The language is fairly good sticking to simple rhymes but on the whole the love of words doesn't thoroughly seep through the pages.  The story line is perhaps a little too \\"everything is rosy, put your index finger in your smiling dimple and wiggle it around\\" Polyanna.  Not that optimistic feel good storybooks aren't the mark for childhood reading... But back to the illustrations...<br />...they are wonderful watercolors that drip and dip with creative colors and a wonderful sense of domestic haloed lights.  It gives off a Florentine home Goddess warmth with an enchanted play between color light and shadow.  My favorite as will probably be your child's as well, is the \\"squishy bug\\" that still gets loved and hugged.  He eats holes in his gardening book and wraps his tentacles around Large's Fox ears.  Wonderful enchanting stuff.<br />If you already have all the baby/toddler/childhood standards and classics by all means go get this one.  ...	2003-03-30

Though he enjoys it immensely, at this point he seems to get a bigger kick out of Seuss' \\"Hop on Pop\\" and \\"Green Eggs and Ham,\\" as well as a wonderful book titled \\"Down by the Cool of the Pool,\\" by Tony Mitton.<br />With Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher's wonderfully artistic illustrations this book is set apart from traditional Seuss books.  That's not a bad thing either.  The illustrations are nearly perfect artistic creations to match Seuss' particular mood he is trying to convey with the message that you will be a different type person sometimes depending on the day and mood.  The colors are bright and intriguing reminding me of a mix between Marc Chagall and Keith Haring.  My favorite is the description of purple days, \\"On Purple Days I'm sad. I groan. I drag my tail. I walk alone.\\" There is a small forlorn purple brontosaurus in the upper right hand corner on a field of white.  Across the picture is a purple trail forlornly painted by the forlorn dragged tail with streaks that emphasize the mood.  Beautiful and poignant.<br />What's even better, especially when my son hones his language skills, is the message the book carries.  It's OK to experience different emotions...just because you feel a certain way at times doesn't mean it's permanent.  Like happiness and sorrow together, this too shall pass, \\"Then comes a mixed-up day and wham! I don't know who or what I am?  But it all turns out all right you see. And I go back to being...me.\\"<br />The illustrations as well as the font and text layout all go to bolster the wonderful message of this book...a book for all ages, all colored days and all times.	2003-03-30

And a few years have passed since their adventure and those fateful seventeen months in 1914-16 when Shackleton and his men encountered the worst Murphy's Law could throw their way.  The book is a testament to human endurance, to Lansing's writing, and the leadership of a man like Ernest Shackleton.  It is an enjoyable read from front to back, from launch to recovery, from freezing to thawing.<br />As far as adventure/disaster books go, I would rank it behind Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot;  Though the author Lansing does an incredible job placing the reader &quot;there&quot; with Shackleton's men as they get their ship stuck in the ice pack in the Weddell Sea, float on ice floes, launch across treacherous seas in lifeboats, and go where no man has gone before on a last ditch desperate land jaunt, the fact doesn't change that Lansing, himself, wasn't there.  I think no matter how hard an author can apply his trade to a story, it is difficult to relay to the reader the immediacy of impending doom and the cold and dread and the spirit that drives men to survival.  Don't get me wrong, Lansing does a fine job bringing off this task, but it is short of the immediacy Krakauer gives the reader of putting you &quot;there&quot; in the desperate situation and knowing what it is like to survive from the worst nature and man has to offer.<br />If you want to read the best in adventure/disaster writing start skip by Junger's somewhat thrill-lacking &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; and head straight for &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; followed by Lansing's &quot;Endurance.&quot;  Be warned though, you will be losing out on some sleep in the process since these books absolutely prove impossible to put down.  Stoke the fire, turn the thermostat up, because you will be chilled to the bone and will probably have nightmares of Sea Lions chasing you across ice floes once you finish the book and finally get some sleep.nally get some sleep.	2003-03-21

Hop on Pop is a rhythmic romp through the joys of reading, rhyme, and sight for babies, infants, toddlers, and parents alike.  The work is both ageless and timeless.  I read this book to my 4-month old and it never fails to get him squealing and wide-eyed in delight.  Maybe he doesn't understand the subtlety and weirdness of three fish in a tree or a bunch of people in bed together but it was the sixties...besides their names rhyme, so there is fun to still be had in the PC 00's.<br />There are so many things to enjoy about this book, that it's hard to find a place to begin.  The weird hybrid creatures, the creative rhymes and wordplay...my favorites are the thing that can sing a long long song.  I break out in overblown Pavarotti-extravagance singing and the boy is sure to either laugh or look at me strangely...is this Dad or is this an alien?  But the biggest joy of the book comes at the end when Seuss strings together endless rhymes with endless rhythm in the string of run-on words, \\"hethreemewepatpuppophethreetreebeetophopstop.\\"  It will be indelibly stamped on your brain and give your child the joy of reading as well as reminding you how truly fun words and pictures can be.  Thanks for all times go out to the good Doctor.	2003-03-13

And so it was with Berke Breathed's Bloom County.  There simply isn't enough out there.  In this collection, the first five creative wacky years of Breathed's Bloom Country are captured showing Opus appearing for the first time alongside a Hare Krishna's...something is lost in translation though into Penguin-speak, \\"Pear Pimples for Hairy Fishnuts.\\"  And so it is with Breathed's Bloom County.<br />Color plates are interspersed ever so often throughout the book.  The black and white really isn't a detractor though because Breathed's off the cuff semi-liberal tongue in cheek anything goes alternate reality humor takes center stage.  There is Milo's Meadow where philosophy rules the day and Binkley chokes on the headlines screaming, \\"The Nicaraguan Contras are the moral equivalent of our founding fathers;\\" remember that was the 80's.  Like David Lee Roth Van Halen, Northern Exposure, and the Bengal Tiger, it's too bad Bloom Country has gone the way of the Dodo, or flying penguins for that matter.  All in all it's a wonderful collection; it's just too bad there's not more of it.	2003-01-24

An immense land of sage, hills, mountains, bighorn sheep, Kiger Mustangs (who were named after the Kiger Gorge who was named after Doc W.D. Kiger pictured on pg. 76), and cattle and plenty of cattle.  And did I mention the people that shaped that country with the presence of cattle and ranches and a pioneering spirit?  The author Giles French no doubt writes this book to bring the cattle barons alive with particular respect and adulation of Peter French.  So in that vein, there may be some impartiality lost along the way.  With that in consideration though, there is some fascinating history captured for anyone familiar with Burns, Harney County, the Steens, and the Malheur Bird Sanctuary.<br />Probably the best aspect of the book is the historical pictures of Burns, French-Glenn, and the round barn that still stands solid today on the P Ranch.  There are many other stories to be told in that part of the country begging for a less jaundiced eye to incorporate the push and pull of land use as well as the native people already resident there.  That's the only area where this book falls short.<br />This book was given to me by a local Vet who has had his hand up the majority of the cattle in the county and it (the book that is) made the area come alive in history.  If you are interested in that area's history, this book comes highly recommended.	2003-01-16

What a great concept!  Take a variety of modern poets, interview them and get them talking about their works alongside the poetry.  Now you see the expectations in such a book to poetry lovers everywhere.  But after owning the book for 7-odd (and they have been) years, I rarely find myself going back to it after the initial read.  Why is that?  Let me try to tell you.<br />Moyers indeed takes a variety of poets to interview, from recognized greats such as W.S. Merwin, Rita Dove, Donald Hall, Adrienne Rich, Ocatavio Paz to name a few to lesser known (at least to me) poets such as, Garrett Kaoru Hongo, Dekou Sundiata, and Mary Tall Mountain.  Some of the interviews are fascinating as one would expect them to be.  But the majority of them drag on.  Instead of making the language come alive, the power of the poetry is diluted when it is talked about.  Give credit to Moyers for attempting the project and to opening up his purview beyond the academically accepted greats and beyond strictly English-writing poets.  For that Moyers is to be commended, but the end effect leaves the reader wanting for more.<br />I have gotten so much more from any on the \\"Best American Poetry\\" series or a little known poetry compilation called \\"The Generation of 2000,\\" for the sheer love of poetry and learning about poets, than Moyers' book.  As for non-English poets, buy the bilingual editions (Paz's collected poems, Neruda's selected poems, etc) even though you don't speak or understand the original language.  It's a must to see and hear how the poetry was intended to sound and also be able to read it in a language you understand.	2003-01-15

From his vantage position of a Boston Globe Middle East reporter and Lebanese lineage, he has spent significant time in the Middle East and seems to have an insider's eye in analyzing the torrid political landscape there.<br />I went on a spate of reading books on the Middle East and Islam after September 11th and this book is at the top of my list and comes highly recommended.  In comparison to V.S. Naipul's \\"Beyond Belief,\\" I would point you to Shadid's book for a good in depth analysis of Islam's current and powerful effect on the Middle East.  Naipul's book is good for telling a story of people's lives in non-Arabic Islamic countries, but Shadid's work is what I was looking for...a well-written and engaging breakdown of a variety of Middle East countries and how Islam shapes the politics and daily underpinnings of those places.<br />Shadid's purview is definitely broad but doesn't loose out in the details of each country and movement.  \\"Legacy of the Prophet,\\" primarily covers Sudan's failed Islamic government, Iran's petered out revolution and Khatami's reform, Egypt's emerging democratic Islamic movements, with several stops in between in Turkey, Palestine, Lebanon, and Afghanistan to name a few.<br />Shadid's overly optimistic thesis is that Islamic extremism is taking in it's last dying desperate breaths and emerging from it, or as a more widespread alternative, a form of democratic political Islam that seeks to inculcate change from within existing governments.  Though optimistic, Shadid at least has taken the time to expose the broader good of political Islam to a West that largely seeks out confirmation of presupposed suppositions of a political Islam that is violent, close-minded, and bent on death and destruction of all things Western.  It seems a case of a narrow-minded and hopeless small minority of Islamic extremists that continue to represent to the West what is accepted (but uninformed) as the face of Political Islam.  Shadid points out that this may not be the case and does it in a way that will keep you interested from beginning to end.<br />I'm surprised more people aren't reading and reviewing this highly engaging work.s accepted (but uninformed) as the face of Political Islam.

It was like finding an unexpected gold mine.  K. Patricia Cross has provided an indispensable book in the field of education for adults in, \\"Adults as Learners.\\"  I recommend it for all thinking about getting into the field of educating adults, already in the field, and those that are on the receiving end of the education.  Life long learning enriches life.  Like an onion peeled away to reveal new layers beneath or a more apt metaphor would be like a caterpillar continuously ducking into the cocoon, recreating, metamorphosing.<br />Cross explores all facets of bringing education to adults and bringing adults to education in plain simple and interesting language.  She has incisive observations that go beyond a culling together of learning theory already out there.  Listen to her sharp tongue and clear wit paving the way for the development of new education opportunities for adults, \\"There are explanations behind these apparent miscues, but the point is that only a dying and unimaginative industry would attempt to base its future on consumer demand.  Consumers cannot respond beyond their experience; thus, responding to consumer demand usually means getting yesterday's answers to tomorrow's questions.\\"  This in response to adult education initiatives based only on consumer research feedback, she clearly hits the mark.<br />Though, the text was written in 1981 and is at risk of becoming somewhat dated in its empirical findings the observations and principles transcend time and are still relevant.  I will be reading this book again in preparation for going back to school to up my education on education.	2002-12-31

It was so engaging in fact that I read it in between my wife's contractions while she was well under way in early labor delivering our son, Connor.  One hand massaging the back, one hand keeping the pages of Elizabeth Marshall Thomas' engrossing book open.  They both worked well towards wonderful outcomes.<br />Thomas' title to her book may be somewhat misleading.  Though it does focus on the social lives of dogs, it more so focuses on the social life of her zoo-like household of a multitude of dogs both permanent and transitory, cats and more cats, parrots, macaws, oh my, and a husband thrown in there somewhere.  The book is more anecdotal than scientific which makes it infinitely more readable but less studied and definitive.  Her fuzzy science pleases though drawing you in to her mixed-species household and you find yourself pulling for Sundog the ever-obedient confident alpha, Misty the wary, Ruby the jester, and Pearl the ebullient life-affirming lost car-finding heralder of all things barkable.<br />It's just hard to not love a dog, the wolves among us.  Reading Thomas' book will cause you to love and appreciate them that much more.	2002-11-06

Its a nouveau re-creation of Walt Whitman jacking up the language benzedrine fueled but coming out on the other end not so much as a imitation but as some wholly new, exciting, and electric.<br />I bought this book from the City Lights bookstore, Columbus Avenue, Little Italy, San Francisco.  The bookstore and press started up by the beat Lawrence Ferlinghetti where there were wild at night readings.  I'd recommend it for the experience, but if you aren't in local proximity of Baghdad by the Bay, the very next best thing is getting it right here on Amazon.  It's pocket portable which is an important thing allowing you to bring poetry out where it was meant to be, into the world...carried in a backpack on hikes, carried in a book bag into the city, carried in, well a pocket, \\"dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix.\\"<br />It's a beautiful book with beautiful language.  Don't be slighted by the critics, make up your mind for yourself.

The book dives off from there and explores themes, the insularity of the writer's life, self-imposed imprisonment, breaking free from said imprisonment, and the losing of the self to a selfless and ominous collective.  DeLillo, as always, captures whatever he turns his ingenious eye towards with intellectual banter, probing literary probity, and beautiful language.<br />For what this book lacks on plot and characterization, it makes up for it on ideals and writing style.  I marvel at the words this man comes up with.  With that said, by now, you may have deduced I'm a fan.  And though I'd admire the writing of this book, I would also add that this one has been my least favorite of his book to date (though I'm only halfway through &quot;The Body Artist&quot; and I fully expect that to take bottom billing).  I would point you toward &quot;White Noise&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot;, or &quot;Libra&quot; if you are new to DeLillo's works and are itching to dig in.

I had to augment with another book I'm reading, \\"Way of the Prophet,\\" by Anthony Shadid to see the lay of the land that Naipaul covers.  What I found is that the closer Naipaul's interviewed subjects march towards his home country of India, the more fascinating, impelling, and impassioned the stories become.<br />The concept behind the book is for Naipaul a follow-up to his previous non-fiction work, \\"Among the Believers\\" that was written in 1981.  Naipaul covers a myriad of personalities from all walks of life in the non-Arab countries of Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, and Malaysia to see the effect a foreign religion where all the holy sites are located far away in Saudi Arabia has had on the indigenous culture.<br />By covering so many different people's stories what we are left with is an impression of each country and the lives lived there, not so much the ins and outs of Islam.  Like an impressionistic painting individual brush strokes can be viewed close-up and solitary and then one has to stand back to get a broad, though fuzzy, complete view.  So it is with Naipaul's book, the individual stories read like a fiction-writers short stories and up-close the language is beautiful and the story is engaging.  But as you back up you are left with an impression of Islam in each of these non-Arabic countries, but not a crystal clear rendition of how Islam has shaped the outlook of the people as a whole.<br />Naipaul's treatise is not doled out heavy-handed.  He observes and occasionally between the lines tells you how he thinks, how he feels.  He views Islam as more of a conquering force taking away local religion and tradition, complicating things instead of making them better.  Perhaps his strongest thoughts come out on Pakistan, a land carved out of India based on a poet's dream of having a land of their own for the Muslim's of India.  You realize what a grave impact this has had on the psyche of Indians and Pakistanis alike.<br />As a Western reader, this book was enlightening.  I went into it looking for a deeper understanding of the way Islam impacts an individual's thought processes, the way Islam might paint the Western World, the way Islam might spur an individual to action based on their beliefs.  What I got out of it was a better understanding of the lives of individuals in the four countries previously mentioned.  Your motivations for picking up this book, may have to be adjusted, like mine were.  It was worthwhile and well-written, and as a Westerner left me with an impression of countries that I had a great deal of ignorance of.  Thanks V.S.a Western reader, this book was enlightening.

It is small enough to fit in a back pocket when traversing over hill and dell tracking down that Northern Flicker.  The cover is also of durable material to weather the dirt, grass, the weather, or whatever you put it through.  Those are the good things.<br />The detractors are that when compared to other bird books, the format isn't the friendliest.  To find all the scoop about a particular bird it is easy to locate the picture, however there is a separate section identifying habitat, range, behavior, etcetera.  Then there is a numbering system separate from the page numbers that make all this cross-referencing and flipping back and forth between the pictures and the descriptions somewhat confusing.  Another confusing thing about the picture sequencing is that two different views of the same bird aren't always placed together.  For instance, on frame number 185 (not the page number mind you) we find the Pied-billed Grebe winter plumage and then a couple pages over oddly enough on frame 195 we find what the Pied-billed Grebe looks like the rest of the year.  So now we want to know more about this feathered-floater, we are directed back to the back of the book...pg. 341 (we are back to going by page numbers) to find out that this little guy has earned the local name, &quot;Hell Diver.&quot;<br />So for an easier to use guide to read from the comfort of your living room or from a car's passenger seat, I would point you to the Stokes Guide to Birds.  Audubon's book does have some good info and unique details on particular birds that can't be found elsewhere, can be carried into the field with ease, and does include some pretty good pics.  The two complement each other nicely, but if I had to choose one...it'd be the Stokes.	2002-09-29

Of the three bird books we own, I'd say the Stokes \\"Field Guide to Birds\\" is at the top of the nest.<br />Besides the individualized color-coded sections with categories for Seabirds, Hawk-like birds, chicken-like birds, bird-like birds, flycatchers, and on and on, the book also features some quick guide features that help you in a tight bind when you have spotted a bird, reached for the binoculars with one hand, reached for the book with the other hand, all the while scaring off your prized find.  The quick alphabetical index is on the inside cover if you know enough about your bird types to narrow down the search quickly.  If you are more of a visual bird boy, there's a Quick Guide displaying wonderful pictures on a white background of 53 of the most common feathered friends.<br />To even make it more handy, there are \\"learning pages\\" among all the individual bird genus species pages.  These are truly insightful giving tidbits of info on Flycatchers, Hawks, Shorebirds, Gulls, Warblers, and Sparrows.  You will be educated by them learning how to identify immature birds, birds by behavior.  It just may include that one tip that helps you put a pos ID on that hard to find match.<br />Compared to other bird books like the popular \\"National Audubon Society Field Guide to Birds\\" this book doesn't leave you flipping between pages to find all the info you are flapping your wings to get a hold of.  With this book I have ID'd Scrub Jays, Northern Flickers, Black Phoebe's, Western Kingbirds, and the Yellow-billed Magpie and consequently learned you can find that Magpie nowhere else but Northern California.  This bird book flies high, higher than the rest.	2002-09-27

It has been pretty indispensable and unbarkably good.  OK, so I didn't refer to it each of those ten years, but for people and kids and families just welcoming or planning to welcome a dog into their family, this is a good all-in-one book.<br />It has a section on different breeds to help match up your choice with your lifestyle/personality.  It has a section on how to pick out a puppy.  A picturesque, simplified, step-by-step guide to training the basics, a little first aid, and everything in between.  For a comprehensive all-in-one book this one can't be beat.  If you want to go deeper into home treatment, or advanced behavioral training, I would suggest you augment.<br />Ten years ago I bought this book and a Yellow Lab/Golden Retriever mix, Hamlet.  He passed away today and was the most phenomenal dog around.  I'd like to attribute part of that to this book, but I'd have to say he'd have probably been the same regardless of David Taylor's excellent book.  It did help along the way though.  I'll be picking it up again to do some puppy hunting in some month's time.  5 barks from me.  Woof, woof, woof, woof, and...WOOF!	2002-09-21

James McPherson touches on all aspects of the Civil War all within 862 pages.  I know what you maybe thinking to yourself...&quot;This isn't a casual read,&quot; or maybe, &quot;History can be pretty dry especially 862 pages worth.&quot;  Ease your foreboding thoughts though; McPherson's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; keeps you engaged with interesting detail, personalities, and cause and effect without ever becoming bogged down.  It's just good writing anyway you look at it.<br />Once upon a time I developed quite an appetite for all things Civil War.  McPherson whetted that appetite in one book.  To learn as much would have taken a small library.  If you read this along with Michael Shaara's Killer Angels, you too will be well on your way to Civil War buff-dom-ship.  Good read.	2002-09-15

Terrorism and the New War	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Compilation Falls Short of Answers	With such an indispensable question asked of this book's title, the book never reaches it to that indispensable mark.  It certainly hits all around the dartboard like a late night drunk randomly firing darts in his favorite corner bar at three in the morning.  But to answer a question like \\"How did this happen (9/11?\\" we need a stone cold sober dart champion focused and singular firing bull's eye after bull's eye.<br />Here's what I mean, in the same book we get disparate articles on \\"The Biological Threat From Abroad,\\" by Richard Butler, \\"What's next for U.S. Armed Forces,\\" by Gen Wesley Clark, and \\"American Society Responds to the New War,\\" by Alan Wolfe; none of which go towards answering the question that continues to burn in the minds of free people across the world, \\"How did this happen?\\" or more succinctly \\"Why?\\"<br />Give credit where it is due to the editors of Foreign Affairs (one of my favorite journals) for assembling such a powerhouse of national policy experts writing about the topics they know best, but to unroot the causes of Islamic extremist one book alone won't cut it.  Delve much deeper than what this book has to offer.  Check out some of the assembled suggested reading listmania lists here on \\"Amazon.com\\" and start digging in.  I've read about 10 books on the subject to date and feel like I have ten more to go to scratch at some sort of understanding.<br />What we need to here from is from inside the Maddrassas that ingrain a hatred of the West from an early age.  These schools are all over Pakistan and dotted about the Middle East.  If we can get at why these children are taught to hate and are hijacking a peaceful beautiful religion maybe we can get closer to answering the question, \\"How did this happen?\\"<br />Read this book to hear how the leaders in their respective fields view the terrorist problem and what is to be done all from a US perspective, but don't buy into the preconception that it will answer the question published on the title.le.	2002-09-08

This book captures that experience.<br />I had such expectations of this book due to the widespread attention and sales this book garnered that anything short of a life-altering experience would be a disappointment.  I thought it would be a transcendent meditation on life, on dying, on the human spirit.  It tries to be these things, but tends to fall short leaning towards the over-sentimental.  It is a noble ideal to share with the rest of the world the wisdom gained from a cherished person.  The author does so with honesty, but I find after reading this two years down the road, the observations, life lessons, philosophy, wisdom gained just hasn't stuck with me.  I would look to other books for life-altering wisdom.	2002-09-05

I'm sitting down here in the campfire light, searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad.\\"<br />--Bruce Springsteen, The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995)<br />And John Steinbeck's novel is still with us, still proving relevant. I would suggest listening to some Woodie Guthrie or Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska or Ghost of Tom Joad while reading this. Though many people clamored for Steinbeck to create another \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" throughout his career that would have been a shame. \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" is definitely Steinbeck's best-known novel and maybe most socially-conscious, but not the pinnacle of his writing. He creates far more in less pages in works like Cannery Row and Of Mice and Men.<br />The strength of Grapes of Wrath lies in capturing the migration West of people in need, people from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas during the dust bowl of the 30's coming to California to find work and a new beginning. The historical accuracy of the plight of the Joad's is up to debate. That is the strength of the Viking Critical Library editions of literature, because the reader gets all the background information divided into the social and creative context as well as a section on criticism. I would highly encourage The Viking Critical Library editions of any great works of literature you are planning on reading.<br />Back to the point of historical accuracy, there are articles from Frank J. Taylor and Carey McWilliams that give a point-counterpoint to what the Dust Bowl migrants actually went through during that time. Maybe the squalid pallor and rancid prejudice experienced by the Joad family wasn't the average migrant family's ordeal, but I have no doubts that there are elements of migrant families lives pieced together. But the historical accuracy isn't really what a work of fiction should be judged against. Steinbeck never claimed it to be gospel, just a work of literature.<br />What is most interesting is Steinbeck's concept of the \\"phalanx\\" or a group of people formed together to act as one person in defense or in survival. Steinbeck portrays that beautifully here. For further reading on that idea and Steinbeck, I would highly recommend Jackson J. Benson's Steinbeck biography, \\"John Steinbeck, Writer\\" as a companion piece to Grapes of Wrath. It will illuminate the man behind the writing.<br />This is not a book that would make my ten best list, though other Steinbeck works would. But I can say I wouldn't have wanted to miss reading it. We find ourselves in times of struggle. We sometimes find ourselves to be people we hadn't known before. We find others as well.

Besides the seemingly at odds title, this book is pretty indispensable as far as poetry anthologies go.  To even people that love and follow poetry the muddle of 20th and 21st century poetry writers can leave one scratching one's head fuddled at where to begin.  This collection edited by J.D. McClatchy is perhaps the best place to start.<br />This book is a smorgasbord of modern day poets.  It turned me on to such vastly different talents as Ginsberg, Robert Penn Warren, and Mark Strand.  It starts with Robert Lowell telling us, \\"I want words meat-hooked from the living steer, but a cold flame of tinfoil licks the metal log, beautiful unchanging fire of vision...\\" and ends with Gjertrud Schnackenberg, \\"Covered with snow, and snow in clouds above it, And drifts and swirls too deep to understand.  Still, I must try to think a little of it, with so much winter in my head and hand.\\"  There is a description of each writer straightforward and unpretentious.  In its compactness, 65 writers are covered with each represented by 3-14 poems each.<br />I was pretty surprised to see only one review written for this book here on Amazon.  I sure hope more people are owning, reading, and cherishing this book than reviewing it because to let it fall by the wayside would be something literally tragic.  It's a jumping off point, a springboard.  A beginning to discovery of writers and word, beautiful, unique, gymnastically agile words.  We like it so much, we have two copies, one I had for myself and one I bought for my wife before we were married.  Now which one will I read tonight?	2002-08-03

They are practical, opinionated, fun to read, and filled chock full of good economical advice on how to enjoy the essence of the place instead of spending your money on sterile luxury rooms and tourist trap extravaganzas.<br />My wife and I lived in Germany for 3 and a half years and traveled extensively within Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and I'll have to say that this Rick Steves' guide tries to tackle too much.  In including Germany, Austria, and Switzerland in one concise guide...sure it makes it easy to carry...but it also makes it easy to leave things out.  I suppose if you only have two weeks to spend and a limited budget for these three countries this book would more than do justice to your trip planning...but you just might miss Baumburg's Rauchbier (beer that tastes like smoke bacon if you can imagine that), that cool antique store on the pass between Austria and Switzerland where you can buy a huge cow bell for little to nothing, and the wine store in Lucerne on the lake where you can buy the rarely exported Swiss vino.  So maybe Rick Steves' discrimination is well and good especially in the case of liquid bacon beer but the rest of Baumburg is pretty phenomenal.<br />If you are going to live in Germany get a more expansive and complete book on each country.  It's not economical, but you have time to wait until the dollar is good against the Euro.  If you are going there with a Euro rail pass just graduating from College, by all means my dear Wanderlust, don't leave without this book.	2002-08-03

There's the Texan that kills the soldier in white through unrelenting conviviality, the cat that sleeps on Hungry Joe's face and maybe eventually killing him, the soldier who see everything twice, Major Major Major Major, the atheist chaplain's assistants who run God's service so much better than the believing Chaplain ever could, and then there is the war and the desperate unfunny catch-22 to stay alive in a business that's bound to kill you.<br />I read this book in High School and have finished it off since then about 4 times.  It solidified my love for literature.  It taught me that to keep our sometimes feeble hold on sanity we have to find the ludicrous and humor in the dead seriousness of reality.  It is pacifist's plea to find some sanity to end the state of things where we legally go out to kill each other, trading blows with the enemy underneath the bombardier's sites and the enemies among us.  I wonder if Joseph Heller could find Peace quite as tragically funny.<br />\\"The only thing going on was a war, and no one seemed to notice...Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn't know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn't funny at all.  And if that wasn't funny, there were lots of things that weren't even funnier.\\"  It's the humor amid the tragedy that in war people die and when people die, there is little laughter and to hold on to your sanity you must laugh.  That's a catch isn't it?  I'll close this in the words of Jimmy Buffet and thank you Joseph Heller for teaching us well, \\"If we didn't laugh we'd all go insane.\\"	2002-08-03

I have a thirst to learn as much as possible about the Middle East, Islam, and in particular the conundrum of Palestine and Israel.  And in a quest to fill this void, I have read approximately 10 books on the subject and to date the most fulfilling book has been Friedman's \\"From Beirut to Jerusalem.\\"<br />Although, Friedman's book mainly covers the years 1979-1989 all the issues, heated emotions, details for contempt and vehement disagreement that were alive and well for those times are very much at the forefront of the conflict today.  Friedman does an especially adept job at not taking sides but exploring the issues from the Palestinian and the Israeli camps equally<br />His reporting from Beirut serves as more of a footnote in history, but his observations from Israel go further.  They capture the media's fascination with Isreal and explain why each event in the West Bank, Golan Heights, and Gaza Strip are looked at under the microscope in the Western world.  Three major religions feel intimately connected with the land and understand the geographical references that are reported in the press.<br />Freidman's book does the best as a complete reference for Israel and Palestine.  He mixes historical understanding, current event reporting, well-worded and logical opinions, mixed with personal stories and vignettes that leave the reader with a more complete understanding than you would get from other books that only cover one or two approaches.  It is a shame that in modern day Israel there hasn't been any Martin Luther King Jr's or Gandhi's that has risen among either side.  Freidman's book though gives a person a better understanding of why that is and just how difficult a path it will be to arrive at a solution.	2002-07-27

Out of the scarce books I could locate on the subject, this one proved to be the best.<br />The greatest thing about this book is the humor that Downey approaches to the book. Laughter is always the best medicine when facing the drooling, spitting up, diaper dirtying unknown. But his humor doesn't negate from the helpfulness of the book either. After getting us laughing, Downey takes the opportunity for a teachable moment to hit us with all the details, facts, and \\"how to's\\" in a no-nonsense approach.<br />Here's what I'm talking about, \\"...the question that I'm constantly asked is, \\"What do you want...a boy or a girl?\\" This is asked with the same casualness as, \\"What do you want on your sandwich..mayo or mustard?\\"...For Goodness sake, we're talking about a baby here, not a sandwich...you get what you get.\\"<br />You also get a guide about \\"Dad\\" movies (to include some thrown in there just because they are gross), advice from Dad's around the block, and Downey's great humor and practical Dad knowledge all the way through.

After living in Europe for 3 years and using Fodor's books for the first year and a half, traveling became much easier and enjoyable, when I stumbled on Rick Steves' practical no nonsense guides to European countries.  We used this guide to see Rome, Venice, Florence, Naples, and Capri and it did not steer us astray.<br />The opinionated advice was almost always spot on and the practical advice of traveling on the cheap allowed us to save up enough money to spend on more enjoyable things then ritzy hotels, tourists trap spots, and gourmet overpriced dinners.  Rick Steves' guides are definitely not all-inclusive so if you want a complete guide to the entire country of Italy you may have to augment with another guide book, but if you want the highlights of the country told from a practical seasoned traveler perspective, this is your guide book.<br />We have done a lot of traveling and used numerous guide books and there isn't a one out there that matches up to the quality of Rick Steves' series.  It's like having your own personal unobtrusive guide, a behind the scenes ex pat that has been there and done that.  If you are going to Italy, by all means, take Rick Steves along...a guide that fits in your back pocket.	2002-07-07

Is he Don Quixote wandering the plains of Spain with Sancho Panza tagging along like the Cockatoo that pulls rings from a stripper's suit? Is he Huck Finn navigating the gothic waters of a South filled with disparate quirky characters and a whole host of preconceptions, misconceptions, and derelictions? Ignatius is all of these and more. The real genius of Toole's sprawling tragi-comedy \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is the uniqueness of the main character and the cast of dunces at the fringes, the fringes of the tale and the fringes of society.<br />When people talk of this novel, they talk of its humor. I didn't find it rolling on the floor funny, like I have with books like \\"Catch-22\\", or parts of some of Don DeLillo's novels. But I did find several scenes so uncommonly placed together with an imaginative patchwork of human freakish delights that it couldn't help but place a tattoo on your brain. That's a little deeper than laughing sometimes. There's the \\"Night of Joy\\" bar where Jones rearranges the dust on the floor and the proprietress takes charitable donations for an orphanage (illicit racy picture ring in reality). There are the misguided political rallies that I.J. Reilly heads up at Levy pants and another for a drag queen party that turn out to be not more than Quixote swashbuckling a wooden sword at spinning windmill blades. The beauty is that people take part for the entertainment, for the diversion from boredom, for the fact of being human and reveling in Reilly's misguided idealism for kicks and grins.<br />To cap off the novel, for the ending there is an escape (not to give it away with details) with a little future hope thrown on top of all the mired downtrodden tragi-comedy we've come to know and love as Reilly journeys along searching for the right words to scrawl across the myriad of Big Chief tablets strewn across his medieval cave of a room. To give the author credit it becomes a suspenseful escape, one that we as readers care about and leaves us with some hopes. What more could you want in a novel?

I read the entire book out loud to an audience and found myself wishing it would come to an end.<br />All apologies to those who liked this book.  I respect that, but the problem for me came in the amount of endless introspection that overflows the pages of \\"The Golden Pavilion.\\"  I don't mind some philosophical pandering in my literature and thoroughly enjoy it when it's done with the uniqueness of Don DeLillo or Milan Kundera.  But here, Mishima takes whatever plot is involved in this tale of a temple student gone awry in the face of foreign influence, loss of values, poverty, and psychosis and sucks the life blood right out the marrow of it.  This leaves the book with no skeletal structure, no bones, just a big lethargic mushy mass of meandering thoughts and not even well-worded or unique ones at that.<br />Here's what I mean, we get no less than 5 pages of a bee landing on a Chrysanthemum...somebody help me please.  We get laboriously repetitive words (not sure if that's the translators fault or Mishima's) with a mention of the character's Kashiwagi's clubfoot about every other sentence.  We get 7 counts of the use of the word, \\"adumbration\\" in one paragraph...7 mind you.  Who uses the word \\"adumbration\\", much less 7 times in a paragraph, 3 in one sentence?  Don't get me started.<br />Not a detail goes by without Mishima turning it over in the character's mind endlessly until we are no longer remotely interested.  It's your typical boy loves temple, temple is too beautiful, boy must destroy temple sort of story.  And where the plot starts moving along towards the end, Mishima interjects some inane meandering ethereal philosophy that seems to lead nowhere, just to kill the momentum.<br />On page 255 there's the line, \\"I was overcome by intense weariness.\\"  So true, so true.  That's how this book grabbed me through and through.ough.	2002-06-09

Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" doesn't really break new ground in original Christian thought as much as simplifies some observations of Christian strictures.  It's not a guide to prescriptive living as much of an insight to what a rationally minded Christian intellectual thinks about his religion.  I suppose I approached this book with minor expectations of life altering thought.  That's not what I got out of it, but instead was reminded and reaffirmed of some beliefs that lay dormant but still deeply entrenched.  Lewis's observations are simplistic but deep.  For that fact, Lewis earns quite a bit of admiration for turning the complex into easily digestible reading is a daunting task.<br />I found the book getting interesting about mid-way through.  The first half was almost too simplistic.  Lewis has some perceptive observations of society's obsession with sex (without being prudish), forgiveness being difficult to put into practice, and the ability of God to change a person but sometimes not in ways that person would expect or be comfortable with.  Of particular note is Lewis' observation of when a person is brought closer to God.  It is not when everything is going right in life and church visits are consistent, but rather when one is brought to question and search on their own, when life is challenging and belief is challenging.  There is a lot of truth to Lewis' writing but some of it rings through clearer than others.<br />Life altering book...not so much.  A Good reminder of God...yes.	2002-05-26

Escapism is a common thread throughout the book.  Joe Kavalier escapes Prague just before the serious persecution of the Jews occurs throughout Europe with the Nazi occupation of the late 30's and early 40's. His family is not able to do the same though and this psychological weight drives his darkness to escape into the creation of a comic book superhero that can fight back.<br />Where Chabon slightly goes astray is trying to do too much. There are artistic nods to Magritte, Dali, and others that seem to come off a little contrived.  In addition the ending feels a little bit set-up kind of like a John Irving dysfunctional family tale where all the disperse elements come together in the end.  It's a projected punch line.  In fiction we like to be enveloped in the story and not see the strings hanging from the puppets leading to the puppeteer.  Sometimes the strings can be seen jerking the characters about.<br />Those are small things that don't detract largely from the enjoyment of this book.  From about page 350 on I was pretty caught up in the story.  There are some great scenes throughout and Chabon really brings alive the theme of magic, mythic heroes in the guise of a Joseph Campbell-esque aura, and what people turn to when reality is too much.  In this current world where reality appears harsh, a temporary escape isn't such a bad thing.  Now I'm ready for that \\"Beirut to Jerusalem\\" book again.

I just finished this one this morning, sticking around in bed for an extra twenty minutes to polish off to last chapter or so.  What a surprise it is to find you're at page 1,038 and never even tired of the length along the way.  It's a tale of an engaging life told in engaging language that grabs your attention and keeps you thoroughly engaged to the end.  What a life John Steinbeck had, and what a way to tell it by Jackson J. Benson.<br />Benson must have started with near a mountain of research to draw together such a complete picture of Steinbeck's life.  It's a task that could have caught lesser writer's struggling much like Steinbeck did with the translation of Morte D' Arthur in an unfinishable Pandora's Box of a book.  But Benson sees it through with apparent love for the writer and care for the detail.  In such a private life of a fiercely guarded private man, it's amazing that Benson adds such a degree of minute detail along the way.  You realize some of the details have to be largely anecdotal and especially anecdotes loyally told carry a good degree of fiction with them.  That's just what makes this book so magical and passionate...a life well told and lived carries a large freedom of fiction along with it.  I think that John Steinbeck would have had it no other way.  Actually, he probably would have hidden away from anybody trying to capture his life in words.  It would have been a horror for him, but thank God we have this book from Jackson and are left with Steinbeck's writing.<br />I made the Haj to Salinas on Steinbeck's 100th Birthday and heard John Jr. speak about his Father and had a little birthday cake to boot.  I played a game with the neighbor's kid as he held Benson's paperweight of a book and ran from me as I chased him down.  I responded with horror as he launched it flying over the fence landing splayed on the ground.  The adult in me told him, we don't throw rocks and we especially don't throw books.  But as I wiped the dirt and dust off of the book and later finished the last fifty pages with grass stains burned into the leaves of pages...I was glad.  A little California earth to go with Steinbeck.  A book well worn is so more sacred than one pristine.  I should have thanked the neighbor's son for the unintended connection.  Rocks against the earth will never grow, but books picked up from the ground...now that's a different thing.  For all those Steinbeck-philes don't miss this book.  For those who have hardly heard of Steinbeck, there's a good deal of life in this book.  I urge you not to miss out on that life.<br />Now I'm off to chase my neighbor's son around the back yard as he carries &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; to the end zone...spike and score.of the book and later finished the last fifty pages with grass stains burned into the leaves of pages...I was glad.

I read this one aloud with meine frau, and although we kept engaged for the description of European cities the story and characters just don't stand out as one's we cared too much about and were never brought to the point of empathy much less sympathy.<br />As you know from the reviews, it's about a group of indigents that are indigent not because they have to be, but because they want to be, it's the easy thing for them.  When they go to panhandle, it's kind of like showing up for work every now and then, gaining enough money to score another hit.  It will make you think twice before doling out money to your next street person, not knowing what the money's going for.  Although this is fiction, it no doubt reflects some reality, and cheapens the truly needy.  It's a valiant attempt for a first novel and by a twenty-eight year old Irish author no less, but I would steer you away.  Try something by James McInerney instead.	2002-03-08
US	46931479	R2E5VSJ2GRS61A	0767902890	852411699	The Things They Carried	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Elevated Writing of War and not of War	I had been assigned to read Tim O' Brien's works \\"Going After Cacciato\\" and \\"The Things They Carried\\" at an Undergrad school that kind of specializes itself in all things dealing with military history, theory, tactics, etc...basically all things military.  Most books you are assigned to read you find yourself enjoying them less than the ones you find of your own fruition.  Such was not the case with the writing of O'Brien.<br />Along with Hemmingway's \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\", Carver's \\"Cathedral\\", and O'Brien's, \\"How To Tell a True War Story\\" in this book, stand out as all that is well and good with short fiction. In fact, I go back and reread O'Brien's \\"How To Tell a True War Story\\" before I take a stab at writing fiction myself to remind me how to do it or at least what to shoot for.  O'Brien doesn't suffer to make the Vietnam War experience come alive again.  Instead he goes much deeper.  He reveals the torrid mixture of fact and fiction that is kept alive in one's mind long after the last shots have been fired.  He brings out the point that fiction is sometimes as important and real as fact because in the end that is what one is left with...not the actual events, but what your mind has turned those actual events into. If I ever taught a fiction writing class, I would read aloud O'Brien's story and tell people...this is what you are shooting for...regardless if you are writing about a stock-broker, thief, young love, old love, life or loss...this is what you are shooting for.<br />Just listen to this, \\"And in the end, of course, a true war story is never about war.  It's about sunlight.  It's about the special way that dawn spreads out on a river when you know you must cross the river and march into the mountains and do things you are afraid to do.  It's about love and memory. It's about sorrow.  It's about sisters who never write back and people who never listen.\\"  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what fiction is supposed to do.	2002-03-08

At least it didn't do what I was looking for it to do.  And at the price [I paid] in the bookstore I bought it in, in Saudi Arabia, it ended up being...more than I would have been willing to pay for it.<br />I was hoping to get some insight into each and every Arabian peninsula country, learn something in-depth about the culture, maybe get a lay of the land, with a couple of in-depth descriptions of the sights, food, and sounds of those countries. Basically what any good travel book should do.  With James Peters, \\"The Arab World Handbook\\" these things are only scratched at on the surface.  It is more of a practical every day life, how to conduct business in the Arab world sort of book, instead of a cultural insight or travel discovery sort of book.  It does give you a fair dose of the language and etiquette with a whole chapter devoted to advice for the business traveler.  If you are heading to the Middle East to work, I would recommend this book. If you are going there to travel or want to learn extensively about life there, go elsewhere.<br />The book is probably due for an update as sadly and ironically within the last section for US support organizations Export assistance lists the New York organization at 6 World Trade Center.  It's a complicated place, the Middle East; complicated to the Western traveler at least...it will take a more in-depth book than this to allow you to get a good feel for that complication.	2002-03-01

Perhaps he will still get a chance to revisit the country in 2009, to get a perspective of the latest iteration of warfare and it's nature and tragic effect on the people of the Country.  At this rate anything's possible.<br />I almost dinged this book for Elliot's occasional writing style that dips into the area of over-flowery, fanciful, and meandering, but surprisingly enough if you keep reading, he keeps this distraction to a minimum.<br />I believe what Elliot achieves with &quot;An Unexpected Light&quot; is the best account of what Afghanistan and its people are like that can be achieved by a Western writer.  The reader must be cautioned to not take Elliot's perception at face value for the truth of how Afghani's think and feel and live.  That local perspective would have to be gained by a book that was written by an Afghani and translated into English.  To my knowledge there isn't a book out there like that available to English readers.  If you know of one, by all means shoot it my way.<br />At first I thought the approach Elliot was taking in writing this book, was to toss himself haphazardly into as many life-threatening situations as humanely possible to experience and still live through it.  Through these blood pressure pumping situations, at the end, Elliot would have himself a damn fine book.  What I came to realize though is that the book was written about a love affair.  A continual burning love affair that Elliot has for the country and especially the people of Afghanistan.  That intense love shows, earning this book a special place amongst other travel writings.  The work fills a distinct need to learn more about a country that Western nations' find themselves enmeshed in during the ongoing war on terrorism.<br />Internalize this book.  There's a need to make that knowledge your own.  Now more than ever.an ever.	2002-01-16

A &quot;Should-read&quot; in these Times	Ahmed Rashid's book fills a much-needed gap in the West to illuminate what was and was not known about Afghanistan's once ruling class-The Taliban.  Ignorance is a dangerous thing in these times, so I encourage you to get this book and read it.<br />With that said there are things that keep this book from getting rave reviews--for me those things are footnotes and disjointedness.  First the good stuff.  The first part of this book was captivating.  Once thing that left me scratching my head in befuddlement though was what was Ahmed Rashad, the sports journalist figure doing writing a book on the Taliban...did the T-bum have some sort of connection to the American NFL? (small but not necessarily funny joke there...it's still good to keep a sense of humor &quot;in these time&quot;).  But seriously, it's important that Ahmed Rashid, a Pakistani journalist, is writing this book because too often we fall into the trap of settling for Western perceptions about Eastern issues.  It's different hearing about the Taliban from a Pakistani journalist, who writes with the convictions and facts of an insider's perspective.  The first two chapters are extremely relevant and riveting.  These sections will enlighten you as to what the Taliban are all about.<br />Now on to the detractors in this book.  I never know what to make of footnotes in books.  Do I read them or do I not?  If I choose not to read them, will I be missing out on some gem of truth or truly engaging factoid.  With that said, footnotes abound in this smallish 216 page work.  I started off reading them and couldn't bring myself to continue flipping back and forth.  It seems if the stuff were worth writing in the first place, it would be included in the text.  Is that just me?  Next, this book really seems to be two books.  One that would hold the majority of everyone's interest consisting of the first two paragraphs and illuminating the Taliban's rise to power, Afghanistan's political and cultural challenges, and how Islamic extremism fits on the world stage.  Extremely great and to the point writing covering the knowledge that begs to be understood while the war on terrorism continues to rage on.<br />Then there is the second book within this book, the one that would draw the interest of corporate types interesting in the oil industry.  Sure that part is peripherally relevant to what is going on with UBL, Mullah Omar, Al Qaeda, and the T-bum, but it just doesn't stand out with the core of the book.  Oil barons, pick this book up and read chapter 3.  The rest of you, it can probably be skipped.<br />Bottom-line.  Good book.  Get it. Read it.  I wouldn't have wanted to miss reading it if that say something to you.w Islamic extremism fits on the world stage.

Unfortunately, I'm coming late to discovering Steinbeck.  I read &quot;Travels With Charley&quot; early on and more recently &quot;Tortilla Flat.&quot;  Of his fictional works &quot;Cannery Row&quot; has far been my favorite to date.<br />From &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; Steinbeck has come a long way.  &quot;Cannery Row&quot; is more cohesive of the two; it's storyline being more linear.  It still reads like a series of vignettes but each leading to the next to put together the tale, and what a tale it is.  It hangs on to a thread of realism and captures a greater sense of what it is to be human, the interrelatedness of a community, despair, and hope, magnifying all of humanity within a microcosm of Cannery Row.<br />Again, there is a characteristic band of Monterey merry men, but this time there is the offset of people with jobs and responsibilities.  Doc, who is based on Steinbeck's great friend Edward Ricketts, leader of the Oceanic Biological Institute, is an endearing character.  Steinbeck paints a portrait of someone you would want to meet, instantly respect, and be lifelong acquaintances.  There is a strong sense of familiarity here.<br />Chapter 2 is some of the finest writing I've come across.  A beautiful two-page poem. &quot;Mack and the boys, spinning in their orbits. They are the Virtues, the Graces, the Beauties of the hurried mangled craziness of Monterey and the cosmic Monterey where men in fear and hunger destroy their stomachs in the fight to secure certain food, where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them.&quot;<br />Truly elevated writing with a sense of melancholy that presents itself as part of life, hanging in the balance with the parties, grocery stores, tidal pools, whorehouses.  Great book.  Now on to Tom Joad.	2001-11-08

You see the Kishlaks passed by at night, raging gunfire spewing forth through the day, you taste the axel grease, bake in the heat of the desert.  Artyom Borovik captures the experience and the personality of the Afghanistan War that the Soviets unwillfully got bogged down in through the 80's.<br />Though there are several things this book is, there are also things it is not.  It is not a higher level capturing of the causes of the Afghan war.  It doesn't analyze the history.  It is not linear.  Instead it takes a broader look at what it did to the psyche of the soldiers that fought there. It spans the globe to follow those that escaped the war to America and yet yearn to return to the rodina.  Borovik's writing reads like a novel and you'll find yourself caught up in the details of military operations and wonder how he got out of there alive with a soul intact.<br />The Afghanistan War closely resembles our Vietnam and strangely enough doesn't mirror the current war waged on terrorism, but there are lessons to be drawn from here.  Outside superpower influence in countries to topple governments and sponsor leaders almost always seems to turn out poorly.  The real lesson learned is to go after Bin Laden like a tribal warlord in a land where there are many factions, the terrain is unforgiving, the people strong and willful.  One gets the sense that war is eternal in this country and that the people pay the price.  So if we don't get diverted from our initial objectives, keep those objectives clear, we can avoid the pitfalls Borovik tells of when superpowers become involved in Afghanistan.<br />Don't hesitate to go get this book and internalize it.  Knowledge will pull us through these times.	2001-11-08

As far as history goes the narrative is engaging and the concise style holds the readers attention throughout.  For the writing alone, I would give this book 5-stars.  What holds it back though, is the singular presentation of facts towards a somewhat biased look weighing on behalf of the Palestinians.  For this reason I downgraded the book to 4-stars.<br />If you are looking to gain more insight into the Israeli conundrum, which in these day and time is of utmost importance, go get this book.  However you will need an accompanying book to get both sides of the story.  Thomas hones in on the injustices enacted against the Palestinians without ever presenting the Jewish perspective.  For controversial issues, there are two sides to every story.  With this book there largely seems to be just one.<br />Thomas has the original thesis that he terms, &quot;the nazi syndrome&quot; that allowed a certain environment to exist in which certain injustices could be justified to allow the Jewish nation to be created at the expense of the Palestinians.  The Nazi syndrome briefly explained is that the Jewish people were victimized at the hands of Nazi Germany and carried that victimization with them, as well as in the eyes of world policy, to carve out modern-day Israel at grave injustices to the people of Palestine.  There is credibility to this notion and no doubt modern country's world policy has been misdirected towards the Israeli problem, but one should seek to gain a complete understanding of both sides before rushing to condemnation.  That's what you don't get with Thomas' book...both sides of the story.<br />&quot;How Israel Was Won&quot; draws parallels to the Monroe doctrine of westward expansion in the states and the analogy is made to &quot;how the West Was Won.&quot;  In doing so, Baylis Thomas gives a fascinating rendering of all the facts and history surrounding the creation of modern day Israel, but don't buy this as the complete picture.s as the complete picture.	2001-10-29

Grotelueschen displays a firm grasp of military theory and how that theory is applied or in some cases misapplied.  The voice Grotelueschen captures is one of an insider no doubt learned in the hallowed halls of West Point.  His firm grasp of all things army belies a thorough understanding of how artillery played a role in the stalemate of World War I trenches.  It is a voice to be listened to and heeded.<br />We reach out to history to not repeat the mistakes of the past.  If we ever get involved in stalemate trench warfare again in the wine country of France, let's hope that all artillery commanders have this book on their reading list.<br />Bottom line, this author Mark Ethan Grotelueschen is brilliant.	2001-10-29

I picked this book up while getting ready to run in the 104th running of Boston and it truly heightened the whole experience.  It enabled you to pick out the landmarks throughout the course (Kenmore Square, Newton Hills, the 25 mile Citgo Sign, the screaming Wellesley girls/I high-fived one of them, the Brookline cemetery in the netherworlds of the last 5-6 miles) and most of all get a good grasp and appreciation on the history that had run before.<br />It's amazing what a complete detailed history the author was able to put together and how he was able to pick out a unique individual aspect from each race.  What stands out are the American Indians running at the turn of last century with Tom Longboat, Clarence DeMar's dominance in the 20's, Kelly Senior and Junior, Bill Rodgers, Ibrahim Hussein, and Cosmas Ndeti.  They are all there with details from the race, details from the runner's lives, details of the victories, and more interesting details of the not quite victorious.  What really stands out is the focus on the plight of women runners in the marathon and how difficult it was for them to break the barrier in the 60's to enter the race.  Bobbie Gibb, Kathrine Switzer, and Sara Mae Berman were true pioneers and had to face harassment from race officials to even be allowed to run in the prestigious Boston Athletic Association great race.  Perhaps my favorite story though is that of Rosie Ruiz in 1980 that jumped the barrier from the ranks of the spectators and ran the last miles and took credit for the women's victory for a contentious period of time. She proved a little mentally unbalanced and to this day swears she won the race.  This book captures all those quirky details and puts together a great history of what the 26.2-mile jaunt in Boston is all about.<br />I hold back giving this 5-stars because the non-runners may not find this book so engaging as myself, but if you care about the sport and especially if you are getting ready to run Boston don't miss picking up this book.  Boston only gets more interesting year from year as a South Korean broke the Kenyan dominance last year and maybe just maybe Fatuma Roba will take the laurel wreath away from Catherine Ndereba.<br />The people of Boston love this race as is evidenced by not a single stretch of the course passing by without throngs of spectators handing you oranges, water, beer.  Consequently the rest of the world has caught on to the enthusiasm of the Bostonians, as Boston has become the marathon to run.  There is prestige, there is sweat, there is heartache and heartbreak, and there is a wonderful history all captured in this book.  Run on.cking up this book.

Granted, but the only reason we were given horizons in this life, was to push those babies out...that's right expand 'em every chance you get.  The Bell Jar did expand mine to some degree.<br />The writing would probably reach out to a young adult more so than someone in mid-life, but it is solid throughout and tells the story of Plath's largely autobiographical descent into mental illness.  Plath comes up with an apt metaphor for her condition, calling upon the strength of language she was bestowed with as a talented poet.  The Ball Jar descends around her cutting her off from the &quot;normal&quot; world...it sets her apart, cuts off the air.  I think Plath must not have been able to escape the Bell Jar in the end as a tragic suicide ended her gifted art early in 1963.<br />It gives us hope today, that we have found better ways to deal with mental illness since those times and individual's stricken with a condition are allowed options and get the chance to chose life.  I guess reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; at this stage of life did expand some horizons, but would probably reach out to those coming of age and let them know problems are out there, and they can be dealt with.  I wouldn't call it an essential read for me, but it might be to others.  Read Sylvia Plath for her poetry over her prose and study her life for a cautionary tale and appreciate what we have learned since then.	2001-09-25

It is a history piece in the mid 17th century that combines a little science, a little bit of politics, a little bit of mysticism, and a lot of intellect, mystery, and sleuthing along the way. All of this sounds quite engaging but the format told from four different viewpoints became distracting and unnecessarily lengthened the tale.  I really would give this a strong 3, but it didn't hold up to other books I've given a four-star to.<br />The format did provide some interesting reading, as the reader discovers that what he assumed before about characters and turn of events is based on wrong assumptions at the whim of a character's point of view.  This was interesting with two characters, but by the fourth, I was looking for the story to end.  If you have the book around, pick it up and give it a read. But I wouldn't call it an essential read.  It probably would have good appeal though if you are into English history of that time or are a die-hard mystery addict.	2001-09-24

Pirsig's semi-autobiographical, philosophical-fiction novel is in several places brilliant. It will give you reason to pause and view life a little differently.  Contrary to it's namesake, it is not a book about the ins and outs of Motorcycle mechanics.  It is about an approach to life that embraces quality as a virtue and grasping things we don't understand and living with those around us even in a state of turmoil.  It's more about life than motorcycles.<br />Sure, Pirsig's tale centers around a motorcycle journey and he definitely has a love for locomoters of the two-wheel street variety, but at it's heart &quot;Zen and Motorcycles&quot; is a high approach to philosophy and ultimately how that philosophy is turned around to care and love for those close to us...our family and friends and how that relationship is to develop even in times of trouble or when family member's face things and problems larger than themselves.<br />Pirsig's alter ego is a character Phaedrus that is waiting darkly in the wings to enter in and wreak havoc. Pirsig as well as his emotionally-challenged son Chris, must deal with this on a motorcycle trip across the states. The afterword provides us with Chris' tragic outcome and the author finds solace in the journey they had together and loved ones that remain. The book may by a little too deep of a trip for a casual read and may not be complete enough for the philosophical gestalt-expectant, but it's worthwhile putting humanity into deep thoughts. Read it. You won't be sorry.	2001-09-24

It's surprising that no one pointed me in the direction of this book to learn more about the exact personal toll of the apartheid policy.  Granted Malan tells his side and experiences as a liberal Afrikaner that becomes an expatriate South Afrikaner and eventually comes back to try to come to terms with his country's separatist racial policy.  There are other sides to this story that should be explored if one wants to get a complete look at what European colonialism and apartheid did to South Africa.  But as part of the story, Rian Malan tells it passionately and you will remember the book long after you've put it down.<br />It is naive to think that since the ugly face of apartheid has been pulled away, Nelson Mandela has been freed, that these problems in South Africa changed overnight.  One can say it was a peaceful revolution (as stated in Susan Dunn's book Sister Revolutions), but there was so much blood leading up to the point where the Afrikaners handed over the reigns of government.  Malan vividly accounts some of these personal tales of blood and what is to be made of them.  The future of his country looks bleak amid these tales of hate and cultural differences, but there is a thread of hope...that maybe they can live together in a strange land.<br />Malan starts off the book, &quot;I'm burned out and starving to death, so I'm just going to lay this all upon you and trust that you're a visionary reader, because the grand design, such as it is, is going to be hard for you to see.&quot;  You may not come to see the grand design but you will be engaged trying as you experience this book.  The grand design in anything is rarely revealed, as the endgame for South Africa has yet to be reached today...but Malan tells it like it is without a grand design, but an ugly design he has witnessed nonetheless.	2001-09-24
US	46931479	R9NETD06GW6OO	0449213447	370928266	The Chosen	Books	5	23	26	N	N	Fiction for the Soul	I only heard of this book recently, here into my third decade of life, and that's a shame really.  When certain books hit you during certain stages of life the impact can be profound.  This one missed me by a few stages.  &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; hit me during the early teens (a perfect time also to tackle &quot;The Chosen&quot;), Catch-22 upon entering college, recently &quot;Underworld.&quot;  The point I'm laboriously arriving at is that &quot;The Chosen&quot; is indeed a great book, but I wish I would have read it at fourteen.  Its message would have been more poignant and internalized then (not that it was entirely lost on a grown up child of today though).<br />The real strength of Potok's book lies in three areas.  First, the insight the reader gets into the American Jewish sub-culture of Hasidim and Orthodox at a critical point in history for Jews (1940's) is truly elevated.  Second, the strong characterization between four very different individuals reveals a beautiful relationship development between father and son, friend and friend, and growing young men encountering the world.  Third, it reaches out for the soul and stays true to things that matter; a search for spirituality, a tolerance for beliefs, a search for a place in this world (for individuals and cultures), and a search for knowledge.<br />The writing overall was simplistic and the reader is handed many things on a silver platter that could have been presented more subtle, more artistically.  Another thing, Sigmund Freud lurks in a mystical &quot;portent of doom&quot; shroud when the character Danny starts to study him.  It is never really explained why the other characters in the book have such a fear of Freud.  What the reader sees is that Danny is studying Freud and the rest of the characters know for certain bad things will befall to his tainted mind.<br />Despite these inconsequential distractions, the story, search for meaning, and character interplay more than make up for it.  I think I would have given this a 4.5 stars if allowed, but I'm leaning towards 5, baby, cuz more stars are better than less.  Give this book to a teen and help them learn tolerance.  It's fundamentally important--now more than ever.hink I would have given this a 4.5 stars if allowed, but I'm leaning towards 5, baby, cuz more stars are better than less.

Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Puts You There with the GI's Marching towards Berlin	I read this book on the heels of Ambrose's D-day and I became hooked and convinced that Ambrose's writing is remarkably engaging and that there is a reason every book he writes sells.  I was lucky enough to live in an area of Germany for three years that the Battle of The Bulge was staged from.  Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot; made the history that occurred in Europe from June of '44 to May of '45 come alive.  Several of the pictures from the book could be pinpointed to exact locations as we traveled from Aachen to Bastogne to St Lo, retracing the hard fought track that the GI's gave their live for as retold in this book.<br />With it's broad scope, this book is not as focused as some of Ambrose's other works like the magnificent &quot;D-day&quot; or better yet &quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;, but it is fantastic for anyone interested in the personal aspect of World War II history.  You will truly get a feel for the sacrifices that generation made to set things straight in the world again, if only for a little while.  With the resurgent interest widespread in America today for all things World War II, this is an excellent read to recall the ghosts of that past and learn from those ghosts to help prevent any future wars.  Read on my friends.	2001-09-08
US	46931479	R2VSJQMR6L7HUK	0553572997	501395694	The Alienist	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Not a literary accompaniment to ET or Area 51	Caleb Carr indeed adds some unique elements to the psychological-serial-killer-gumshoe-on-the-case-detective-thriller type genre.  What Carr brings to this novel is his attention to history as he attempts (and succeeds) to catch the essence of the times.  Those times would be Gotham City, The Big Apple, NYC almost at the turn of last century, in the late 1880's.<br />The reader finds all sorts of characters within The Alienist (none of which disappointingly are actual Aliens)...the quirky and innovative &quot;Alienist&quot; Lazzlo Kreizler, the crime beat reporter for the NY Times, John Moore, and the on-the-rise action -oriented Theodore Roosevelt.  Side characters include New York street denizens rescued by Lazzlo, J.P. Morgan, Crime bosses, street urchins/boy prostitutes and potential murder victims, forensic detectives and a cast of others.  All of this is centered around catching a serial killer that is offing NY boy-male transvestite prostitutes.<br />The most unique element of the book is the way Carr reveals techniques that Lazzlo and detective crew employ that are brand new at the time...psychological profiling and forensics.  Furthermore, he places these techniques in history by showing how &quot;normal&quot; society blanches at this unproven &quot;witch doctor&quot; science methods.  It is truly interesting observing the construct of the killer from clues that Roosevelt's ad hoc underground detective group pick up and build the criminal in order to stop future murders.<br />The characters aren't strongly developed.  The plot sometimes comes haltingly.  But for all that, it is an engaging read.  It doesn't top my list or get 5-stars, but I think you will enjoy it for a summer read or for enhancing those dark short days of winter.	2001-09-07

Everest Disaster	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Into Thin Air Rises to Dizzying Heights	You'll want to read this with an oxygen mask on, because Krakauer's immediate and bracing writing will put you feeling and tasting the peril of that fateful '96 Everest expedition in which 8 people perished. I can honestly say that I have never been so completely absorbed by a book as I was with &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot; I picked it up and held on tight for the horrifying, and all together engaging, ride up Everest and really didn't put it down until I was finished a day and a half later. It was that good. What puts this book above the rest of the fray of wilderness adventure writing is Krakauer's personal and extremely knowledgeable take on the sport of Mountain Climbing. In addition to that, he is just a plain good writer. He tenders and cultivates his trade as a writer much as he does his love for the skill of climbing. Krakauer's cautionary tale in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; should have kept recreational climbers far away from the overcrowded, life-taking, and littered slopes of Everest; however, it was followed by the Breshears' IMAX expedition of the film &quot;Everest&quot; that again put the wanderlust of high altitude into arm chair climbers across the globe. That doesn't lessen Krakauer's socially conscious effort to keep the mountains pristine and discourage inexperienced climbers from getting in over their collective vulnerable heads before they have had time to gain experience in their sport. This book made my &quot;15 best books that I wouldn't have wanted to miss reading in a lifetime list&quot; (that's quite a long title for that list). But the point is, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; is that good. I plan to read it again when my breathing returns to normal, my feet warm up, and I can resupply my oxygen bottles.	2001-08-28

It's my favorite of poetry books by living English-speaking writers. His early work reflects influences from Latin Surrealists like Octavio Paz. He moves later to the personal...autobiographical, beautiful elegies, and words on that basic thread that ties together the human experience...love. But enough of the pretentious crap on poetry that exists out there already in useless spades, on to the meat and bone of the matter, the poet's words. You be the judge. Here are some of my more favorite lines: &quot;Tonight as it gets cold tell yourself what you know which is nothing but the tune your bones play as you keep going.&quot; from &quot;Lines for Winter&quot; &quot;She slept without the usual concerns, the troubling dreams--the pets moving through the museum, the carved monsters, the candles giving themselves up to darkness. She slept without caring what she looked like, without considering the woman who would come or the men who would leave or the mirrors or the basin of cold water.&quot; from &quot;She&quot; &quot;Ink runs from the corners of my mouth. There is no happiness like mine. I have been eating poetry...She does not understand. When I get on my knees and lick her hand, she screams. I am a new man. I snarl at her and bark. I romp with joy in the bookish dark.&quot; from &quot;Eating Poetry&quot; and finally &quot;The meek are hauling their skins into heaven. The hopeless are suffering the cold with those who have nothing to hide...There are stones in the sea no one has seen. There is a shore and people are waiting. And nothing comes back. Because it is over. Because there is silence instead of a name. Because it is winter and the new year.&quot; from &quot;Elegy for my Father&quot;	2001-08-28

I got this lightly entertaining, packed fact chock-full, irreverent little book as a gift from my mother-in-law. Yes, a woman from Southwest Oregon, raised in cattle country on a huge ranch that had been in the family for generations. This was a sympathy gift for me, when playing family trivia pursuit, I responded with surprise when a &quot;Holstein&quot; came out as the answer to a question. First there were blank stares in my direction from around the table, and then came surprise, disbelief, and finally the boisterous and gratuitous laughter, all generated by my unknowledge of the wonderful Holstein. I could see it in their eyes...my esteem took a whack downwards that day in their bovine-wise eyes. The scandal and shame of it, with me being from Texas and all. Now I know a Holstein is a dairy cow with spots. I'm armed and semi-dangerous with this funny book. Did you know that a Piedmont has a big, big beefy butt? A Cow can detect odors up to five miles away (they must despise being a cow then with the way they smell)? How about how many stomachs a cow has? A: 4. You would know all this if you had this book. I wouldn't call this book essential or anything quite that elevated, but it is truly fun. If you get laughed at for not knowing a Guernsey from a Galloway, you might want to get this book. I used to hate cows when I saw what they did to the land, whilst hiking in Idaho. Now that I have the book, I don't hate them quite as much.	2001-08-27

This award giving out to the most outstanding work of Fiction in a given year includes the names of past honorees, William Faulkner, Delillo, Gaddis, Roth, etc. I'm sorry to say that Pete Dexter is not one of these. The premise behind the story has promise. A small town racial murder and how that town and the main characters deal with the aftermath. We do find ourselves frightened of Trout, shocked by the blatant racism, and fearful of the silent acceptance that lies beneath, but in Dexter's hands the story falls short. The writing doesn't come across as anything above the norm. Some of the plot events seem to be thrown in just for shock value and nothing more. Out of all the books that my wife and I have read aloud together &quot;Paris Trout&quot; is one of the more forgettable. If you are looking at knocking of some National Book Award winners, go read Delillo's &quot;White Noise.&quot; The award going to &quot;Paris Trout&quot; in '88 just seems a little fishy to me.	2001-08-27

The lack of giving this 5-stars isn't so much for the translation of poetry (since I could only order a ziegersnitzel, book a zimmerfrei, and little else en deutsche), but simply that the writing hasn't drawn me back into it time and time again like the bilingual translation I have of Octavio Paz. Whether it's the poetry from the poet or the poetry from the translater, I'm not sure.  With that said, there is some brilliant poetry here and Steven Mitchell being a poet himself puts it down faithfully with regard for the poet's voice. I wasn't under the impression that German could be a poetic language, but after being exposed to it and reading this book I'm moved to change my opinion. Here's some of the better lines: True singing is a different breath, about nothing. A gust inside the God. A wind. And the beauty of bilingual editions gives us Rilke's words as well: In Wahrheit singen, ist ein andrer Hauch. Ein Hauch um nichts. Ein Wehn im Gott. Ein Wind.	2001-08-27

Good point that Moore makes here and he was definitely leading the way for America to turn to a more spiritual approach to everyday life and the way we look at things. For a period of time, an author just had to toss the word, &quot;Soul&quot; in the title to sell some extra copies. Chicken Soup and everything else for the Soul, etc. So there is a recognized need there. Does Moore address this need? Yes and no. Moore doesn't seem to fall overboard into blatant spiritual new age guruism, but he's definitely leaning on the rail. As a psychotherapist, the descriptions of case studies and Moore's redress to his patients to get at what is inside their soul causing the pain holds validity. Where the validity is lost though, is when Moore tries to stretch this focus on the soul out to assigning souls to every object. The internal organs have souls, coffee tables, and the good majority of people (excepting politicians, Los Angeles, and techno dance remakers of originally good songs). Hang on to the life raft, Moore, you're almost falling starboard into the drink. Great focus--to get back to the soul, though I think there are probably better books out there to read and enlighten the subject.	2001-08-27

Paz does an ambidextrous job of mixing in elements of surrealism with the bone of natural objects and that which is very real.  His, and the translator Eliot Weinberger ... along with the help of other poet translators to include Bishop, Levertov, Tomlinson--all of their words come alive with beautiful language.  The translation seems true to the intent.<br />What is essential about this book is that each poem comes with the bilingual translation in English and accompanied by the original works in Spanish.  Two years of high school Spanish, as well as two years in college, has rendered me with a woefully inadequate ineptitude of all words and understanding of that language.  But I don't think that the translation can ever capture the sound, the alliteration, the true tongue/la lingua and fluid language that Paz meant in his original Spanish.  Even if I don't understand a lick of what's on the left side of the page in Spanish at least it can be read for it's beautiful sound. Listen to this, \\"Through the conduits of bone I night I water I forest that moves forward I tongue I body I sun-bone Through the conduits of night\\" and then on the even-numbered page, \\"Por el arcaduz de hueso yo noche yo agua yo bosque que avanza yo lengua yo cuerpo yo hueso de sol Por el arcaduz de noche.\\"<br />What are you doing still sitting here reading my crappy writing when you could be reading Ocatavio Paz?

Since it is a book about climbing mountains, it's a worthwhile read, but there are far better mountain climbing books out there...&quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by Krakauer...anything by Heinrich Harrer.  Frank Wells died shortly after the book came out from a helicopter accident while heli-skiing.  The movie &quot;The Lion King&quot; is a far better and moving tribute to a great man than this book.

Maybe he is so much of a genius that he has created in a novel, Ulysses, a work that is so far above anyone's heads that since the majority of the reading public doesn't understand, well then, by God, it must be supernova brilliant.  Was it just me?  Did my intellectual shortcomings not allow me to truly enjoy this work that makes everyone's top 10 books of the century list?  Or was Joyce just playing around?  A writer with mastery of the language decided to fool around a little and release a novel that is an exercise in experimentation on what you can do with language but nothing really more.  To harbor my fragile intellectual ego, that's the theory I'm going with.  Greatest book of all time or not, I just didn't get it.<br />This book is supposed to be about Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus and a day in the life of Dublin in 1904.  I really had to read the other reviews or cliff notes to be able to discern what happens on that day despite reading the book thoroughly. I know I sure didn't get it from the book. If cryptic meaning, having to read other books so you understand the book you're reading, and spending months slogging through a book is what your looking for in a read, by all means tackle Ulysses.  Should we have to labor so hard to enjoy a book?  I don't think so. The unique language and wordplay stand out above the rest of the white noise fray making this book redeemable, like a 783 page poem with no plot, if you can imagine enduring something like that.<br />Maybe Joyce, from an Irish heaven, 70 year later is having the last laugh, as the intellectual world hails his &quot;playing around&quot; as THE modern masterpiece.  Maybe it takes an English Literary Doctorate and many years to get enjoyment out of this book.  I don't have either though, so the enjoyment wasn't there. Joy is the reason I read.  I didn't find it with Ulysses.	2001-08-02

However, for me, it doesn't reach truly elevated sublime \\"best book in 25 years\\" or top ten list status.  With that said it's a worthwhile read for a phantasmorgorical look at India and Pakistan history and the plight of the countries.  The 1,001 Midnight's Children carry around supernatural gifts, some pretty powerful, some not so spectacular.  The protagonist Saleem Sinai, just happens to have a super-dooper nose and can converse with all the midnight's children in his head.  His archenemy, Shiva, he of the gargantuan knees spoils Saleem's leadership of the Midnight's Children ....  It's a cautionary tale of what could have been and deeper underlying, Rushdie weeps for his country of India and what could have been.  The most unique convention of the novel is that Saleem's life parallels the development of India.  It's a rather ambitious task that Rushdie sets out to do to capture India's development within a fictional life.  The writing is well-versed, intelligent, and compelling.  There is a good command of language, not quite as elevated as that of Nabokov, but good nonetheless.  It reminded me a great deal of Gunter Grass' Tin Drum in the aspect of a fanciful characters reflecting a Country's development, so may lose some originality points for that.  All in all though, an enjoyable read, but not one that I want to go back and read anytime soon, which is the true test of literary greatness for me.  I would read Catch-22, the Underworld, and Crime and Punishment again and again.  For Midnight's Children, once was enough.	2001-07-25

It has a point to make.  Important this many years later for its denunciation of totalitarian communism, Orwell felt strongly to tell the world how the Soviet's had derailed and bastardized the socialist cause.  The story is semi-compelling.  The writing is a little flat. That's what keeps it from earning 5 stars.  There once was a time when searching out the meaning behind each allegory was elevated to a Holy Grail Hunt at the encouragement of High School English teachers everywhere.  As adults we've came to realize symbolism just isn't all that cool.  It's great and fun that there is a code here...the pigs are the communist ruling class, Snowball may be Lenin or Trotsky, Napoleon may well be Stalin.  It's intriguing but a lot of work to figure it out.  Literary art takes elements of reality, life, and elevates it to another plane.  There are some eerie moments here when things come full circle and the pigs look like men an men look like pigs, but if you want the true masterpiece of Orwell denouncing the totalitarian state, give &quot;1984&quot; a read.  This one's short and cheap though and can be polished off in a day or weekend.	2001-07-16

It is powerful in its compactness.  My wife and I read it aloud to each other on the course of a 5-day backpack trip in Desolation Wilderness.  It really read like a true to life horror story of the atrocities humans can inflict upon other humans.  The most frightening thing about the book is the refusal to believe the impending hardships and relative blind sightedness the Jewish community in the Hungary village undergoes during the first part of the book.  Hindsight offers us the element of dreaded expectation we feel in horror movies before something really bad is about to happen to the unwary on-screen character.  Only with this book it really did happen.  The author starts out with a developing devout mystical faith in God and by the end loses it in its entirety.  No human bean should have to lose their faith that way and that really is the power of the book.  At some of the holocaust displays and concentration camp sites that I have seen in Europe are the words, &quot;Lest we forget.&quot;  This book sears the lessons humanity learned from the terrible tragedy of the holocaust and leaves us with a yearning to never let those events occur again. Of interesting note is that the high tide of the protagonist experience in the book is when they are sequestered off within a controlled Jewish Ghetto in their Hungary village.  The characters enjoy cultural unity and isolationism and find it comfortable and familiar.  All this in the face of eventual imprisonment and extermination.  There are parallels to the modern day Balkans and the sectionalization movement around the globe to align political entities with ethnic entities.  Maybe it makes a group feel comfortable to be surrounding with like people.  We just can't afford it in modern society.  The world moves towards diversity and those that find a way to thrive and revel in that diversity will succeed.  Lest we Forget.ive and revel in that diversity will succeed.  Lest we Forget.	2001-07-15
US	46931479	R1JGIWJ03ZFYON	0140042407	206112752	Tortilla Flat	Books	4	24	33	N	N	Steinbeck marinades Monterey in cheap wine	This is more like a series of linked vignettes centered on the free-wheeling vagrant (with a home) communal that lives above Monterey.  The Paisanos', headed up by Danny, lives are irrevocably altered once Danny is bequeathed two broken down homes from his recently deceased Viejo.  Steinbeck's writing here is direct and the life lessons the characters stumble upon haphazardly seem profound.  One of the most unique aspects of the work is how seeming dishonest thieving lifestyles are justified by the amoral moral code developed by the Paisano's.  The whole story has a deep sense of place, with the run down Tortilla Flat sitting above Monterey coming alive bit by bit.  I read the whole book on a 5-day backpacking trip, so it's a short quick read but one worthwhile.  The only other thing that I've read by Steinbeck is &quot;Travels With Charley&quot; which I thought was fairly phenomenal. The writing style deserves a 5, but since the shortness of the book didn't allow it time to delve too deep beyond linked short stories I'm reserving my 5's for possibly some of Steinbeck's books yet to be read by me.	2001-07-15

Browsing through these eyewitness guide books are almost as fun as going to explore the city itself.  With a 3-D cutaway of the Transamerica building, pictorial timeline of the history of San Fran back to 10,000 B.C., and beautiful presentation of the best of San Fran's eats, the city by the Bay never looked so good.  Another unique aspect of these guidebooks are the neighborhood by neighborhood 3-D birdseye depiction of streets and buildings with highlighted points of interest.  It's amazing that so much information can be packed into such a concise package while making room for the wonderful pictures throughout.  I used this book to plan several day trips to the State's most beautiful and unique city around, even laying out a great all day mountain bike romp through Bagdhad by the Bay.  If you are scared off thinking that this book is only surface fluff and glossy pictures, don't be, a give it an &quot;A&quot; for content as well.  Fodor's can't hold a candle to it.  Lonely planet may be more thorough but lacks the fascinating pictures and 3-D reps.  If you are spending any time in San Fran, get this book...you won't be sorry.	2001-07-14
US	46931479	R14PUUK96EUPEE	0471243787	778544091	Gandhi: A Life	Books	3	11	13	N	N	All the facts are there but where's the Passion	I guess I found myself wanting to like this book so much more than I actually did, due to the profound respect and reverence I have for the subject matter.  A read-through of this book definitely proves educational, as Chadha seems to capture all the facts surrounding Gandhi's extraordinary life.  What is lacking is the passion and enthusiasm that fails to bound the reader to Gahndi's profound beliefs in Ahimsa/non-violence and the Satyagraha/soul-force resistance movement.  Some highlights of the book are the extensive retelling of Gahndi's initial efforts in South Africa, his personal family life, and the well-researched background behind his assassins and the assassination.  Gahndi's life is such a motivational influential epic that it's a shame to not have a biography to match it.  This is a good book to read to learn about the historical facts surrounding Gahndi's life, but if you are looking to get to know his spiritual side and get caught up in his inspiration, the biography has yet to be written. I just wasn't enthralled with the writing.	2001-07-12

Delillo, in my humble opinion, is the greatest American writer writing today (at least that I've ran across) and the &quot;Underworld&quot; is the best by him that I've read (Libra and White Noise).  The opening scene of the 1951 Giants/Dodger's playoff game with Robbie Thompson's &quot;shot heard around the world&quot; is a cornucopia of characters and a brilliant snapshot of that time and that place.  It quite simply is some of the best writing I've read.  The novel traces the history of the cold war through its effect on a variety of characters all with ownership of the Thompson Homerun baseball in common.  Some of the memorable moments are the Texas Highway Killer, a lengthy discourse on garbage (it really made me think in depth about the subject of something we discard and would rather forget about), and the cold war's effect on people's personal lives (something I only caught the tail end of).  The only detractor from the work was the reverse chronological telling of the story, though a bold attempt, tends to lessen the impact of the characters' stories and the inevitable march of history.  To get a good feel for the best in modern fiction, read the Underworld. It will definitely be worth your time.  I read it as part of the Brother's Book Club (BBC) and it generated great in-depth discussions and has been my favorite to date.	2001-07-08
US	46931479	RA5V9W5OE77YL	0140103767	466312032	Arab and Jew: Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land	Books	4	11	14	N	N	Insightful and Even-handed	Great book.  If there were a way to give this book 4 and a half stars, I would have rated it such.  Shipler's book manages to give a face to both sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict without taking sides.  Never before has there been such a need for people to be exposed to the intricacies behind both sides of the Middle East conflict.  If you are interested in the historical facts that have led up to the Promised Land's current state of volatility, there are probably better books to go to.  However, if you want to hear from the inside what the Palestinian experience is like living in occupied West Bank, Golan Heights, and Gaza Strip and their viewpoint of Israelis, no book can do it better. Also, what stands out above the fray of literature on this subject, is the continual reaching out of individuals and individual groups' to reconcile their differences and the points of hope and points of futility that result from these attempts.  If you are looking for something black and white that will give you a clear conclusion on what is to be done in the middle east Pandora's Box that is modern day Israel, this book will not give it to you.  What it will give you is an epiphany as to just how complex the human dimension is between the Jews and Arabs and how there really is no clear solution to the conflict as long as things remain status quo.  It is not a hopeful book, but a deeply revealing one.  Don't hesitate to buy this book if you are interested in the human dimension in modern day Israel and Palestine.	2001-06-19
US	46931479	RAY0ILK73SZTZ	0571199895	309653111	Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light	Books	4	18	19	N	N	French Rev Bad; American Rev Good	I am surprised that there aren't more books out there tying together the American and French Revolutions.  I read this book as part of the Brother's Book Club (BBC) and thoroughly enjoyed the e-mail discussions it generated.  If you are looking for a chronological historical breakdown of the two revolutions, this would not be the book to get.  If, however, an analytical breakdown of the causes that generated and fueled the two revolutions, the thought that kept them aloft, the intellectual connection and differences between the revolutions, and lastly the impact that they had upon the rest of the world; all sound compelling to you, then by all means go buy this book.<br />One detractor is Dunn's oversimplification in her critical look at everything involving the French Revolution and high praise for all things American Revolution.  She follows this code, almost without exception.  A more objective analysis would have been more meaningful and valid.  The strength of the book is Dunn's revelation of the power of ideas.  She makes it inducingly clear that the historically decisive actions of the world were driven by the power of ideas.<br />Perhaps the most compelling chapters come at the end, as Dunn stretches intellectually by portraying the two revolutions as models and exploring the effect they have had on subsequent revolutions around the globe.  The biggest surprise is that after Dunn praises the American model, she concludes by finding America's current system of government inefficient and suggests that the British Parliamentary model is the best fitting for modern day democracies. How we come full circle.<br />Good book for those interested in the thought process behind the American and French revolution, but not so much for a historical breakdown of the two.  Through exploring the power of ideas, Dunn comes up with some powerful ideas of her own.	2001-06-16
