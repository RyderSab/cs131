This book starts at the beginning of the GHW Bush Administration and goes through to the very beginning of the Gulf War. <br />It's always a little difficult to know how accurate Woodward's recountings are of conversations and inner-thoughts of the most important people, but there are rarely serious complaints about the accuracy of his books - at least as far as I am aware.  For the most part, the book comes from the perspective of Powell and Cheney, with important additions from other key folks at the Pentagon and White House. <br />The beauty of reading about the GHW Bush Administration is that one also learns about the GW Bush Administration, for many of the key players came back for an encore.   <br /> <br />Woodward did a top notch job of discussing important issues in a way that appeals to the general reader.  I hope he continues to do so with the GW Bush Administration; both \\"Bush at War\\" and \\"Plan of Attack\\" are fine books, but \\"The Commanders\\" is much better.	2005-09-17

There are too many people who argue that the end of the Cold War had everything or nothing to do with Ronald Reagan.  As Bush and Scowcroft make plain, intentionally or not, change was coming around too quickly for anyone to claim credit.  I know the standard story-line: Reagan raised defense spending and this drove the Soviets to spend until they collapsed.  It's a simple story, but it leaves out far too much to be accurate.  Bush was on the tail end of a decades-long strategy of containment; thankfully all presidents stood their ground in confronting the Soviets.  Perhaps we should all recognize how fortunate we were to have Bush and Scowcroft in leadership positions for the four years they served as President and National Security Adviser.  Admittedly cautious, they used their time wisely in dealing with the Soviet Union. <br /> <br />Very thorough in dealing with German reunification and in standing up to Saddam.  It's amazing to read the Gulf War stuff: Bush and Scowcroft discuss the importance of alliances, the UN Security Council, containment, and the difficulties of urban warfare.  Apparently someone's son did not read the book.  Are we better off or worse off for that?  Time will tell. <br /> <br />In a sense the book is not co-written because the two authors go back and forth in describing their different memories of the four Bush White House years.  An original approach. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, no discussion on the U.S. invasion of Panama.	2005-08-27

Still, he sure did get a raw deal.  What a few reviewers here failed to note, however, was that a lot of the raw deal came from within the Republican Party.  Although the right-wingers love to whine about the media, a close reading of Quayle's book shows that his frustrations often came from dealing with James Baker and many other important people in the Republican Party and the Bush campaign organizations.  There is no doubt that the media enjoyed reporting on Quayle's difficulties, but the media ran with the background sources and leaks they were given from WITHIN the Bush White House.  Ah, but to recognize that would take some serious self-criticism, and that simply is not allowed. <br /> <br />Otherwise, the book is enjoyable.  It was an interesting look inside the Bush Administration and the only first person account of the modern vice presidency.  Well-written too. <br /> <br />PS: Anyone else notice how many of the Quayle book reviews have spelling errors?  Makes you miss the days of potatoEs, eh?	2005-08-27

The most important part of this book is the discussion about how Martin Van Buren pretty much created the two-party system in the U.S.  The idea that an organization and it's policy positions should take precedence over any particular individual was an important change in American politics.  Furthermore, it led to an important advance in the spreading of democracy in the U.S.  Of course, as with all changes, these changes did not come without costs.  But the country is, for the most part, better because of Van Buren's party leadership.  As for his presidency, who cares?	2005-07-31

There are a surprising number of little mistakes that should have been picked up in the editing process.  Granted, the topic is timely and important, but would the world have collapsed if the publishers held on to the book for an extra month for another round of read-throughs?  Also, there is just too much writing.  Editors should have crossed out a lot of unnecessary stuff.<br /><br />There are two reasons I point out one factual error I came across.  First, it makes me feel smarter.  That is less important to everyone else, but it makes me feel good.  Second, if I found one error, people who specialize in other areas may have noticed other errors, and those should be pointed out.  Anyway, on pages 218-219, Rothkopf describes Reagan's National Security Planning Group (NSPG) as having been \\"chaired by Bush and [it] ended up dealing with issues like the spate of terrorist attacks and other crises that confronted the administration.\\"  The NSPG did indeed deal with important issues, and in some sense it probably dealt with the issues he pointed out, but Rothkopf is confusing the NSPG with the Crisis Management Team, which later became the Special Situations Group, both of which were chaired by VP Bush.  The NSPG, however, was more accurately described by Bush's VP chief of staff, Craig Fuller: \\"The [NSPG] is the most restricted national security council meeting that is called.  It is usually confined to the principals, meaning the Secretaries of State, Defense, Vice President, ... the Director of Central Intelligence, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the President's Chief of Staff, [the National Security Adviser and deputy NSA] and ... usually the Attorney General and Secretary of the Treasury, but it can be expanded depending on the topic.\\"  No more than a dozen people usually attended, and only the President and Vice President brought their chiefs of staff (p. 923).  There were usually two NSPG meetings per month.  The Tower Commission report noted that the NSC meetings were becoming a bit too big for productive discussions among the principals, so the President turned to the NSPG.  And from everything I have read, Reagan was at most of the meetings.  This is not a major error, but at the same time, the NSPG was an incredibly important component of Reagan Administration foreign/national security policy.  Perhaps there are other errors.<br /><br />One of the funnier errors: the Washington Post Book World review pointed out that the picture on the cover is more likely from a Cabinet meeting.  Elaine Chao, Secretary of Labor, who is not on the NSC, is clearly visible in the picture.  Was it really that difficult to come up with a better, more accurate picture?  If people do judge books by the cover, this one has not put its best foot forward.<br /><br />The good stuff: Rothkopf's description of policy viewpoints is interesting.  Rather than the constant chatter about the personal spats between major members of foreign policy (although those are included in the book too), we should hear more about what these people think.  This important stuff is shaping the world.  Another great aspect of the book is that Rothkopf got an amazing amount of access to the key players through interviews.  These are the people who have shaped the world over the past four or so decades.  The quotations, although a bit long, are practically a primary source of data for other researchers.  Hopefully someday Rothkopf will make his interview transcripts available to other researchers.  Great stuff there.	2005-07-31
US	53022502	R3EBOBMN2NWYFL	0375508473	67444811	The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Well-written, mostly fair, not very deep	There aren't any other comprehensive books that look into the Clinton years, so by default this is the best.  Those who hate Clinton will hate this book (as is apparent from some of the other reviews here) and those who love Clinton will blush at many points while reading it.  I suppose a truly objective person will find The Survivor more pro-Clinton than anti-Clinton, but I think both the pro's and anti's will wish it was more to their liking, which is probably a better mark of its fairness than either side cares to admit.      The President Clinton that Harris writes about is more complex than most people want to believe.  He wasn't simply addicted to the polls, and he wasn't simply guided by what he felt was right.  Of course, as with all of humanity - and especially politicians - both factors played important roles with Clinton.  The big difference with Clinton was that he had bigger doses of everything.      Two important points: 1) Clinton, for all his supposed political intelligence, was incredibly naive and unprepared when he entered the White House.  It's practically embarrassing to read about his continuous complaining about the ways of Washington.  Hell, I only visited the city a few times and pay moderate attention to the news and I KNOW what's it's like.  How was it that President Clinton and the First Lady were so caught off guard?  Senator Hillary Clinton darn well better get a thicker skin if she really wants to pursue the White House herself, although everything I have read about her indicates that she really has made those adjustments.  2) President Clinton was far more likely to follow his gut and work against public opinion than many people give him credit for.  The Mexican bailout and Serbian Air War are but two examples.  He is a caring man who, like all presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush, loves his country and did what he could to make it better.  Harris fairly captures that.  And still, I can't help but get frustrated when reading about his relationship with Ms. Lewinski.  As much as I liked President Clinton, that stuff was disgraceful.  How could someone so smart be so stupid?  Well, smart people often do stupid things.  (No pun intended.)    Finally, the book's most crucial flaw is its lack of depth.  He could have dug so much deeper.  Perhaps he could have brought in more thorough analyses from the worlds of political science, economics, international relations theory, management theory, psychology, or any other field to help analyze Clinton and his presidency.  By way of comparison, the perfect journalistic coverage of a modern president is Lou Cannon's \\"President Reagan: the Role of a Lifetime.\\"  And \\"The Survivor\\" simply does not measure up; but then, few books do.  Well, for now, it's what we have, it is good, but it could have been great.	2005-07-16

John Quincy Adams was one of the smartest and most educated men to serve as president.  With all that intelligence, he really stunk up the White House.  Remini points out how absolutely blind and deaf JQA was to politics.  He would not campaign in even minor ways or do anything to help his chances for political success.  Perhaps we could use more of that in today's world, but at the same time, politics is politics.  If one truly believes in the importance of long term planning and success, he or she must be willing to make some short term sacrifices.  With all that said, JQA's secretary of state years under President Monroe were incredibly successful.  JQA practically created the Monroe Doctrine and made the case that sometimes preemptive action is necessary.  Samuel Flagg Bemis is apparently the expert historian on JQA's State Department years, and Remini relies on his work for that chapter.  John Lewis Gaddis also made use of John Quincy Adams's leadership of the State Department in a comparative look at grand strategies, along with FDR and GWB.   <br /> <br />The book is interesting, short, and well-written.  Little more can be asked for.	2005-06-11

There are flaws in it: other reviews have pointed out the occasional repetitive sentence, and Halberstam could have better cited his sources, but still, there is nothing else out there any better.  A few other gripes: Halberstam focuses far too much attention on Clinton as the poll-driven politico.  I'm not doubting Clinton's political drive, but it is possible that he was so heavily focused on polls because he had certain policy preferences he wanted to enact.  Granted, he may not have been good at laying that out there, but the Clinton-as-amoral-poll-hound seems a bit overplayed.  Halberstam could have better laid out the different international relations/foreign policy philosophies of major characters.  This might have been done a little bit earlier on in the book (I honestly can't remember), but it should have been discussed throughout.  This would have made the book more useful for foreign policy courses.  Also, in writing so much about the Balkans, a few maps would not have killed him.  Too many people know too little about the region.  There is not a single map!  Ridiculous.  Charts and timelines would have been helpful as well. <br /> <br />Still, Halberstam wrote a thoughtful and thorough analysis of the topics he covered, which were those small wars between the Cold War and the wars on terror and in Iraq. <br /> <br />	2005-04-29

The little nuggets of information in it were fascinating.  There is no doubting Gordon's central premise: the economy of the US, which is based in capitalism and the pursuit of wealth, has allowed the nation to become the most powerful in the world.  At the same time, getting to that position of power caused a LOT of pain in many regular folks.  Gordon appropriately points out slavery, but the pain has been constant.  That is not to say it hasn't been worth it, but there is always another side to every story, and Gordon - as well as those who have made lots of money - focus more on the positiive side.  The section on the 1980s offers me a little more of an ability to comment.  In pointing out the magic of de-regulation and tax cuts under President Reagan, I am sure much capitalistic energy was released.  At the same time, Gordon doesn't mention how Reagan increased taxes, Bush increased taxes, and Clinton increased taxes.  Any or all of those moves should have reversed positive economic trends that Gordon celebrates.  Of course, we know it didn't happen that way.  Even after Republicans in the early 1990s cried that Clinton's tax increases would send the nation back into recession, those Republicans were wrong.  And the Reagan-80s also left a lot of regular folks without any gains, if not losses.  Those stories are no less important.  There is far more to a successful nation than unbridled capitalism.  But I don't doubt that a country is more likely to be successful with more capitalism rather than less.  In fairness to Gordon, he does an excellent job in highlighting FDR's New Deal and how it helped bolster the US when the nation was in difficult times.<br /><br />  I highly recommend that after reading this fine book, everyone looks up Jeff Madrick's fantastic review essay from the New York Review of Books (V 52, # 4, 03/10/05).  He makes some excellent points that need to be considered along with Gordon's book.considered along with Gordon's book.	2005-04-27

I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I'm no expert on TR, Wilson, Taft, or Debs, but I think this book serves as a well-written and entertaining introduction to the people and issues surrounding an important election.  I teach an American government course and this book was an excellent vehicle for class discussion.  From the book we were able to talk about elections, political parties, the role of government in addressing societal problems, and a host of other topics.  It's a good thing that Debs was featured in the book.  Socialism thankfully never stood a chance in this country, but people need to appreciate why so many people were giving it a serious look at the time.  Debs, although misguided, was a hardworking man offering something unique.  People today do not appreciate the difficulties and day-to-day suffering so many citizens had to deal with.  So it is. <br /> <br />The book largely focuses on TR and Wilson, who were the powerhouses of the first two decades of 20th century American politics; it seemed to most of my students and myself that TR was presented in a better light.  Maybe that is the way it was.  Don't know.	2005-04-01

I think it is important to note, as some other reviewers here have done, that if you are a right- or left-winger looking for blame, you will find it.  That is, blame can be thrown at all.  Reagan and GHW Bush started the problems (and in fairness, they did so because they were facing bigger problems).  Clinton deserves credit for recognizing that Bin Laden was a problem, but did not commit to an aggressive enough strategy.  GW Bush did not at all recognize the problem at the start of his administration: he was focused on China, Russia, Iraq, missile defense, and ABC (anything but Clinton).  But when it became apparent that Bin Laden was a real threat, he seemed willing to aggressively address the situation.  By that time though, time had run out.   <br /> <br />Now, recognizing that the fault of allowing 9/11 to happen is bipartisan, we also must accept that blame falls on all of our shoulders.  The signs were there for all to see, and yet none of us were aggressively looking to solve it.  No one could appreciate the problem until 9/11 happened.   <br /> <br />Coll wrote a precious book.  I gave it four stars because it was just a little too thorough for my taste.  A little tough to slog through, but important nonetheless.   <br />	2005-03-31

Frank offers a great explanation for why so many regular folks back a party that will not help them economically.  By substituting social issues that will not address the regular Joes' needs in place of economic issues, the right is able to see their economic concerns addressed.  Those concerns are, and have always been, tax cuts, deregulation, and laissez-faire capitalism.  Amazingly, the regular folk never really see much policy progress on the social-issues front.   <br /> <br />My major concern is that Frank believes the modern Democratic Party is too moderate and business-friendly.  There are many on the left who agree with him.  As I see it, if the Democrats are to embrace Frank's remedies and move the party further to the left, the Democrats will only see more election losses.  Whether or not a moderate Democratic Party is good or bad is a secondary matter.  Stopping a conservative-led government from enacting its policy preferences should be far more important to the Democratic Party than having proud liberal-Democratic losses.  The only Democrat to win - and that was with pluralities, not majorities - was Clinton.  Perhaps he was not liberal enough for most Democrats, but having him as president sure beat losing! <br /> <br />As the country continues to face mounting deficits, federal court nominations of conservative justices, and further retreats from modest social safety net protections, hopefully future party squabbles will be minimized so that we can keep our eyes on the prize.   <br /> <br />A final note: many liberals believe that moderates do not have firm beliefs and are too willing to compromise important values.  I can't speak for all moderates, but I know that my beliefs are firmly held.  And one of those important beliefs IS compromise.  The idea that one must \\"give to get\\" is of core importance to me.  That does not mean that I care less or that I am willing give away anything for next-to-nothing.  In politics we must pick and choose wisely.Unfortunately, for the past few elections, we have not done too much with any wisdom.  Maybe better times lie ahead.

Did he win the Cold War?  Did he bust the budgets sending us into mountains of debt?  Did he bring about the great economic times of the 1980s?  Did he just put a smile over the real problems of regular Americans?  And what about Iran-Contra?  Your answers depend on your political ideology.  Both conservatives and liberals will stretch, bend, and lie to make Reagan's achievements or dissapointments match up with their ideological bent.  These wing-nuts will ignore tons of facts that argue against their position.  This will also be the case for Clinton and GW Bush.  So it is. <br /> <br />Cannon, however, has written the single greatest book on the Reagan Presidency.  Unlike the liberals who took pot-shots shortly after Reagan left office, or the conservatives who are trying to rewrite the past with overly glowing accounts, Cannon wrote a book whose format should be followed for every president after they leave office: thoroughness and fairness.  Cannon, who covered the Reagan White House for the Washington Post, was so much more than just a journalist when he wrote \\"Role of a Lifetime.\\"  He was part political scientist, part psychobiographer, a small part memoirist, and, indeed, he still didn't forget the writing skills of a well-trained journalist.   <br /> <br />If you're a hardcore conservative or liberal, you will not love this book.

My thoughts on this book match up pretty much with Oberdorfer's book on the end of the Cold War, which was originally titled \\"The Turn.\\"  They both offer a more open-minded approach.  Matlock, in this book, has a bit more distance from the event, which allowed him more access to the Soviet side.  And he was an insider's insider to what occurred.  Oberdorfer's account is as the top-notch journalist he was.  It's easier reading and thoroughly entertaining.      Matlock offers a fairly moderate view on the end of the Cold War.  For the past decade or so, the right has been on a mission to rewrite history about Reagan and the Soviet Union's demise.  In essence, they want us to believe that the Soviet Union collapsed because Reagan drove them to it by building up the US military, which in turn forced the Soviets to build up; the Soviet problem though, was that they had limited resources.  When pushed too far, they collapsed.  Clever and convenient story.  Also false.      Liberals don't really get it right either.  They feel Reagan is irrelevant and that Gorbachev came in and saved the world.  Also convenient and clever.  And again, false.    The truth lies somewhere in-between.  US policy towards the Soviet Union was well in place before Reagan came around.  That isn't to say that there weren't differences between Reagan, Carter, Nixon, etc., but the idea of containment was already in existence.  And we have Truman and Marshall to thank for that.  Still, Reagan was absolutely correct to call the Soviet Union an \\"evil empire.\\"  They were.  Reagan also offered the American people a positive vision and purpose.  Finally, he showed that we could build up in a way that no nation could compete with us.  Of course, we went further than was healthy; but alas, we are still standing - and they are not.    Gorbachev, too, was a different kind of leader.  Because he still preferred socialism that does not mean he was Stalin or Brezhnev reborn.  Gorbachev was different.  Plain and simple.  He could have fought harder and killed to maintain Soviet supremacy over the East.  Some of his predecessors have done just that - by the millions no less.      Both Reagan and Gorbachev, as well as social forces much bigger than any individuals, played important parts in a process that was much greater than its parts.  Matlock justly notes all of those facts and he takes us through a fairly brief account of the actual meetings and inside discussions that helped change the world into something better.  But the future, as we all found out on 9/11, was not without risks and problems.	2005-01-30

Truss does not escape this reality.  But she is still funny, if not hilarious.   <br /> <br />Unlike most guides of grammar and punctuation, which are desert dry, Truss's book is easy to read.  And it will help everyone better appreciate the importance of proper punctuation.  Of course, it wouldn't have killed her to let us know what a \\"greengrocer\\" is.

The Publishers Weekly blurb succinctly captures the basics of the book and Fischer's important contributions to better understanding the importance of the Crossing, the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, and the guerilla war in Jersey.  More importantly, Fischer points out Washington's excellent military leadership.  General Washington has taken a lot of heat for supposedly not measuring up to other military greats; but he better appreciated the \\"big picture\\" of winning the war, even if he lost his fair share of battles.  More civilian and military leaders today should better appreciate what made Washington's war-leadership successful. <br /> <br />Fischer also fully discusses the Hessians' contributions to the war; they are often underappreciated components of the British forces. <br /> <br />Finally, his bibliographic essay and appendixes are fantastic for those wanting to quickly find important little tidbits about Washington, the Revolution, or the specific battles of Trenton and Princeton.	2005-01-18
US	53022502	R37FGIUN44EA65	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Interesting, but not his best.	I love Michael Crichton.  His greatest book, not surprisingly, is Jurassic Park.  Of course, it is difficult to measure up to that.  The great part about Crichton's books is that I feel like I am learning something while I read fun fiction.  Kind of like the Da Vinci Code, which was much better than State of Fear. <br /> <br />In this book Crichton makes a much more political statement than he does in most others.  Simply put, cries of global warming are actually lies.  He offers tons of citations claiming that the environmental-liberal belief in global warming is not based on evidence.  Lord knows I can't speak to the science, but the names of the journals/magazines he cites appear to be some of the bigger ones in the field.  And if Crichton is even partially correct, we all need to reevaluate our beliefs in environmental policy.  And if he is not correct, those believing in global warming need to step up to the plate and show us why Crichton and his ilk are wrong.   <br /> <br />The weaknesses of the book are that the characters are for the most part caricatures of those Crichton has little respect for.  All of the environmentalists are angry, overly subjective, and base their opinions on emotions.  Crichton clearly has little regard for Hollywood types who do not practice what they preach.  There's nothing wrong with calling people out for their shortcomings, but a more realistic - and less cruel - approach would not hurt.  To be honest, I came close to giving this book 3 stars because of the caricature thing and also because the story is a little far-fetched, but then I realized that I couldn't put down the book.  That is always the true mark of success for fun fiction.   <br /> <br />Still, it is sad that most people will take from the book what they want without really appreciating all that Crichton is saying.  Liberals will hate the book because it goes against much of what they believe, and conservatives will love it more than they should.  The book is really pointing out the ridiculousness of ANYONE who puts ideology before science - and people from both parties do that.  Environmentalism is really only a case study for a far larger point, and Crichton offers some really interesting commentary at the end of the book.  His appendix on the politicization of science is really worth reading and quite interesting.   <br /> <br />Well, hopefully it starts a useful debate.  If he's wrong, science and facts should be used to prove it, not ideologically driven disbelief.  If he is correct, we need to address it. <br />	2005-01-13

Granted, it is not a page-turner in the Grisham sense, but it is quite readable.  The chapters on the actual events of 9/11 (what is known about the takeover of the planes, the NYC first-responders, and the various levels of governments' first responses) is absolutely fascinating.  I found the chapters on the actions of the terrorists up until 9/11 less interesting, but still important.<br /><br />There have been so many ridiculous assertions about who in government left us exposed.  I think the report makes a good point of showing that no one single person or entity is responsible, yet we are all responsible.  First, demagogues like Sean Hannity and Michael Moore have filled airwaves and movie theaters with lies, and the Report does a good job of dispelling many inaccuracies.  Clinton did NOT blow a chance to have bin Laden handed over to the US government from Sudan.  Bush did NOT allow any terrorist-helping Saudis to sneak out of the country immediately after the attack.  Atta did NOT meet with an Iraqi in the Czech Republic.  There was NO connection between 9/11 and Iraq.  And there was no meaningful connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda (although there were VERY modest attempts at communication between the two - but connections between Al Qaeda and Iran are stronger.  And connections were also strong between Pakistan and Al Qaeda).  Some on the right have tried to claim that the screw-ups were bipartisan with 8 years of Clinton mistakes and 8 months of Bush mistakes.  They hope to show, with that claim, that yes they both messed up, but clearly Clinton messed up more.  Total BS: it was more like 25 years versus 25 years.  BOTH parties could have done more.  Make no mistake, presidents of both parties had houses of Congress controlled by opposing parties; those outside of the White House could easily have led in-depth Congressional investigations.  Or they could have put together commissions or think-tanks or anything to look more closely into terrorism.  Frankly, we ALL blew it.  I guess we can't expect much more from politicians, but we need to FORCE them to man-up and do their jobs.  And whenever they get away with not doing their jobs, WE ARE TO BLAME.<br /><br />The United States is the greatest nation devised by mankind.  What makes it great is the many freedoms it recognizes for its citizens.  These freedoms are not given to us by our government: they are ours by virtue of our humanity.  Although I claim we are all to blame, at the same time, we will always be susceptible to tragedies like 9/11.  To have freedom is to acknowledge that it can be abused.  But as Ben Franklin said, those who treasure security over liberty are worthy of neither.  Let us fix our mistakes, but not by making other mistakes.  Let's make the country safer and stronger and stop playing the blame game.  It's time to stop listening to the Moore's, Hannity's, Franken's, Limbaugh's, O'Reilly's, and Coulter's of the world and start thinking on our own.t together commissions or think-tanks or anything to look more closely into terrorism.

George Washington owned slaves.  Nothing new there.  For anyone who looks at the title and thinks this is another attack on the foundingest (sorry) of all Founding Fathers, that person is making a big mistake.  I love reading about the Revolutionary period and the Founders, and George Washington is my ultimate favorite historical figure.  Yet we all must struggle with a great man who took part in a great injustice.  There's no way to get around it.  And don't go claiming that we can't judge him by today's standards.  Although that would be foolish, we can fault him by not living up to HIS OWN standards and the standards of many from his era.  Washington knew slavery was wrong.  Many around him argued vehemently against slavery.  And yet... <br /> <br />What Wiencek does is look at the topic from many different angles.  He is part historian, part memoirist, part current events commentator, and part novelist.  That is, he writes beautifully about a topic that clearly means a lot to him.  He tells us Washington's story, but he also talks about HOW he came about the topic and HOW he went about researching it.  For example, he writes about his trips to Mount Vernon and how he actually took in his own hands the tools slaves used at Washington's estate; he tried for only a short time the jobs slaves had to do all of their lives.  I have not read tons on slavery, but of what I have read, nothing so clearly ingrained in me the cruel monotony of the lifestyle as did Wiencek's telling.   <br /> <br />Weincek also chronicles some of the modern era's efforts to deal with our past.  When Williamsburg attempted to do a mock slave sale, he poignantly described how just a single reenactment was so emotionally draining on all involved; it was never repeated again.  One of the more interesting of Weincek's findings was that Washington actually took part in a slave raffle.  So sad.  <br /> <br />When I finished reading the book, I was not left with hatred for the great man.  I still love him, but wish he did more to end the great American moral failure.  But coming up short is not the same as coming up empty.  He freed his slaves upon his death and provided some economic assistance to them for many years later.  Other slaves continued on at Mount Vernon until Martha Washington passed away.   <br /> <br />Well.  There it is.  History, if nothing else, points out our failings so that we don't repeat them.  Of course, we often do repeat many of our mistakes, but maybe, just maybe, the next time will be less painful.   <br />	2004-12-10

To be honest, I think the Black brothers could have covered the important stuff in about 50-100 pages; instead, they walk you through just about every southern election.  They should have developed a few instructive case studies rather than covered everything.  But then, if I were so smart, I could have written my own southern politics book.    Anyhoo, the changing political dynamics of the South are incredibly important for understanding the future of our nation.  People are going to continue to move down here (I live in Columbia, SC), so the region is only going to become more important over the coming years in presidential elections and national politics.  The Blacks' theory on why the South went from strong Democrat to Republican is interesting, but you can easily get the basics from the first and last chapter or so.	2004-12-07

Not that any of the Cross books are deep, nor are they supposed to be, but this one was far more shallow.  Patterson kind of jumped around and left us hanging more than he needed to.

This and Rakove's \\"Original Meanings\\" are two must-have books that left me with a completely different outlook on the the Revolution, the Founders, and the millions of us who have followed in their footsteps.  I read a book review by some political scientist who said that the mark of a good book is if, after reading it, you can't look at the same topic in the same way again.  With Wood's \\"Radicalism,\\" I will always look at the topics under discussion differently.  So what does he say?  Well, to put it briefly, the political world we live in was changed from pre-Revolution British colonial society by our Founders.  They wanted to instill different values on how all Americans related to each other.  No longer did monarchy, paternalism, etc. dictate our social relations; as of the Revolution, republicanism, virtue, and other values ruled.  However, and this is a big \\"however,\\" the changes didn't stop with the Founders.  It is not so easy to begin a revolt of such radical and far-reaching measures - and then just shut it off when desired.  Changes kept coming.  By the 1820s or so, regular folk wanted in.  In on government, financial independence, and respect.  Democracy, equality, and the like became the important concepts - and they were treasured by the middle class, not just by the elite.   <br /> <br />Well, it was worth the ride.  The last third of the book is the best.  I HIGHLY recommend this expansive view of early American society.	2004-11-30

Oberdorfer was a journalist for the Washington Post and had as close a view to the 1980s US-USSR foreign policy process as anyone outside of the government could have.  With his fine writing skills, he offers the reader a balanced account of the changing relationship between the superpowers of the Cold War.  Of course, the powerhouses of Reagan, Gorbachev, Gromyko, Dobrynin, Shultz, Bush, and Shevardnadze are the focal points; but there are many other important players who contributed no small amounts to what happened at the tail end of the Cold War.   <br /> <br />Ronald Reagan was no doubt an important force in American government: all presidents are.  However, there is and forever will be controversy over his impact on events.  The right wingers want us to believe that he single-handedly brought down the Soviet Union by being tough and forcing them to spend money until they collapsed; the righties also believe Gorbachev had nothing to do with his country's implosion.  The left wingers want us to believe that Reagan had nothing to do with what happened and that Gorbachev deserves all of the accolades.  As with all debates among the two ends of the American political spectrum, the truth lies somewhere in-between.  And Oberdorfer offers us a look into a process that was bigger than the two leaders, albeit a process that was greatly impacted by all involved.  As America continues to debate Ronald Reagan and what he left us, maybe some day we can all accept that he was something more complex than the right-wing and left-wing want to believe.  But until then, there is this fantastic book.  Enjoy. <br />	2004-11-29

Rather than blame Clinton, the generals, the soldiers, or any specific actor or set of actors, the author walks us through a nightmare of a mission-gone-wrong.  He offers concluding comments that points fingers at MANY people involved.  And in effect, aren't we all really somewhat involved and somewhat worthy of blame?	2002-07-09

Realizing that Bailyn is quite an accomplished historian-scholar, I put off reading this - I assumed it would be brilliant but very difficult to get through.  Well, I was correct about the brilliant part - but wrong about the \\"difficult to get through\\" part.  It was increadibly readable.  Also, the main points of the book are important to understanding American political thought.  Interestingly, the country's revolutionary thinking originated from the very country we were fighting againt - ENGLAND!  In arguing the continuous debates over the tension between liberty and power, the pamphlet writers of the day turned to 17th and 18th century thinkers to make their case.  The best parts of the book are the last two chapters.  In the second to last, originally the last chapter until the enlarged edition came out, Bailyn discusses concepts like democracy, representation, and slavery.  In the final chapter, \\"Fulfillment,\\" apparently written much later, Bailyn focuses on the Constitutional Convention and the arguments between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists; particularly, what they felt about virtue residing among the country's people and how best to form a government.  One final note: Bailyn's sources from other scholarly journals will lead the read to many interesting gems - especially a few of the articles from William and Mary Quarterly (a must-have journal for anyone interested in the time-period).  <BR>ENJOY!	2002-03-14

I am not much of a war buff so I had doubts about reading a book about war.  The main reason I read it was because I was born and raised in New Jersey and love George Washington.  Ketchum satisfied both aspects - he explained the entire 1776 retreat through NJ and the subsequent attacks on Trenton and Princeton, while at the same time conveying the predicaments that faced George Washington and, in turn, his ability to overcome the continuously difficult situations he was in.  At first, I thought the book would only discuss the battles, but Ketchum provides excellent insight into the main characters of the battles with interesting footnotes that inform the reader of where many individuals find themselves in the future.  The book is both expansive and readable - a fabulous combination.	2002-01-09

John Adams ranks right up there!  I have read some rather harsh reviews of the book: they basically claim that McCullough falls in love with the focus of the book and that he is inaccurately biased by the infatuation.  Well, I cannot comment on the accuracy as I have read little else about Adams; most of what I remember is that Adams was not entirely personable, and perhaps downright grumpy.  McCullough refutes that and, most importantly, his writing is top-notch in pleasure and readability.  For those that disagree with his characterization of Adams - WRITE A BETTER BOOK! (if you can!).  Otherwise, accept that other interpretations of Adams may be accurate.    Don't be fooled - this is a great and enjoyable book.	2001-12-17

While many would have us believe that the original meanings of the Constitution can be grasped by reviewing the text of the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and other important documents/statements, alas, it is not so easy.  The Founders meant different things at different times and had different reasons for stating what they did at any given time.  Does this mean that, because they said so many things, they actually meant nothing or anything?  Of course not, however, it is not an easy task to understand them on the face of the written words - without also appreciating time, context, audience, etc.  Oh well, so it goes.	2001-08-31

As opposed to textbook description of our governmental process, Smith's book digs a little deeper to describe how American government - and politics - really works.  It is big but fairly readable.  There are some flaws: the book is a bit dated as it was written in the late 80s (e.g. Smith talks about the problems of PACs in campaign but today's problem is soft money); there are a surprisingly decent number of typos and editing oversights; finally, like I mentioned, it is a large book and at some points, few as they are, where the book drags.

US	53022502	RZLXRV8LG0XJ3	0156004801	475362106	All the King's Men	Books	5	3	8	N	N	Thick and Rich	All the King's Men is based on Louisiana's Huey Long.  Willie Stark's story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, an aide to Gov. Stark.  One can quickly realize where the entire notion for Primary Colors came from.   A note of warning: the book is set in the 1920's through 1940's of the Deep  South; within that time-line and region comes nasty social realities.  I  haven't a clue as to whether Warren himself comes out in the derogatory  racism or if he just wants to truly capture the era, however, it is  difficult to accept how casually and easily such fowl language can be used  against other human beings.  With that said, I think a far greater harm  would be done by trying to sugar coat the past into something it wasn't.    The book is incredibly well written and one can feel themselves a part of  the story with the intense description throughout.  All the King's Men is a  classic story of how a politician feels he must resort to achievement by  any means necessary as opposed to exhibiting proper means AND ends.  ENJOY!	2000-07-23

To address the Stand thing: sure there are some similarities, however, it is original.  I found the first 100 or pages to be very depressing and I  almost put it down for good but as I trucked through, the characters  started to really come to life and, as was probably the author's intent,  hope for the good guys and the world in general grows.   A fantastic  journey that makes the reader believe that good can come out of our worst  nightmares. PEACE	2000-06-19

What's really great about it is that Goodwin looks at BOTH FDR and ER.  Moreover, it is important to know how, in the most important period of the 20th century, these two people supported and  influenced each other.  We may never see such a strong team of leadership  again.  While romance may have faded between them, their care for each  other and dedication to the United States we incredibly reinforcing.  A  GREAT BOOK indeed.	2000-04-21

South Carolina politics).  Really looks into Strom's positions with race and his moderations from extreme positions.  Unfortunately, Strom has yet to admit  to taking unfortunate stances and hasn't admitted that states' rights was  no more than a cover term for racist policies.  However, he has since  moderated his stances and has lived his life in a way that doesn't condone  such nasty positions.  Also, Strom's abilities with constituent services is  praiseworthy.  Not too long and fast - read it and learn about the  twentieth century's (and now 21st century's) most enduring political  character.	2000-03-08
US	53022502	R3A0LZXQY7D0FP	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Fast paced fun and original	This is not Grisham's greatest book (the two greatest being A Time To Kill and The Firm).  With that said, the negative ratings seem unfair.  Some interesting points: Fist, it is unique for a Grisham tale to not revolve  around a main lawyer character (a couple convicted judges is as close as we  get).  Second, it is somewhat timely as one of the characters is running  for the presidency.   The story reminds me a bit of The Partner (which I  really enjoyed).  How two (or more) opposing sides deal quickly in a game  of chicken which could bring down a presidential candidate is most fun to  read.  The biggest weakness is the lack of reality.  The presidential  candidate is chosen by the CIA in a most unrealistic fashion.  Oh well,  it's not Tom Clancy or War and Peace - if you're looking for something fun,  then buy it.	2000-03-01

He doesn't simply attack Clinton, nor does he just go after Republicans.  Obviously there is much blame to go around and Judge Posner dispenses it as he sees fit - finding fault first and  foremost with the President and then moving on to each and every other group that deserves it.  The first two or so chapters are a little difficult as he dissects the intricacies of legal arguments regarding perjury,  obstruction of justice, and the like, however, when he gets to evaluating  the various groups, the book picks up pace.  From the Clinton-haters to the  Clinton-defenders, each group is exposed for what it is: less than perfect, if not downright ridiculous.	2000-02-19

It's just not the smoothest/fastest read.  I knew nothing about Huey Long before picking this up, except that he was considered a demagogue.   Apparently he was one of the most amazing politicians of at least the 20th  century, if not in American history.  Unfortunately, I knew nothing of the  supposed infamous goings-on around Huey and found some of the detailed  explanations of what seemed like tedious little legends to be far too long  and boring.  Never heard of a round robin and I am now convinced I never  want to hear of one again.  When comparing this book to &quot;Truman&quot;  by McCullough, there really is no comparison - Truman is the greatest  biography ever.  This book is incredibly well researched and (in some ways  unfortunately) does not leave anything out.   PEACE	2000-02-12

While some of the below comments express bitterness towards Truman's presidency, they offer nothing to back up their problems.  While  McCullough generally takes a favorable position towards the president, he  backs it up with facts.  And don't be fooled: McCullough discusses Truman's  weaknesses, faults, and mistakes.  To say that the Truman Doctrine,  Marshall Plan, creation of NATO, beginnings of civil rights, etc etc, were  small or bad initiatives for a president would be a mistake.  Read the book  and decide for yourself!	2000-02-03

Crichton is amazing: he can take subjects I could never think I would find slightly interesting and make them incredible page turners: never thought I would care about dinosaurs running around, female on male discrimination,  airplane safety and 60 minute-production lifestyles, etc; moreover, you  feel like you learn something from fiction.   This book is a fine addition  to the Crichton world.  Mixing time-travel with 14th century France is so  much more enjoyable than I could have ever believed.  I would have given it  four and a half stars if possible.	2000-01-02

I love all of her other books I have had the time to read.  As I recall, Hornet's Nest received many bad reviews and I could not figure out why: loved the story and loved the 3  characters.  HOWEVER, this book was just plain bad.  Hoping to get a great  continuation on Hammer, West, and Brazil, the characters were shells of  their former selves.  Too many incredibly unreasable things going on and  far too many characters scrunched into a very lame ending.  Worse yet,  these folks are high level police personnel in Richmond, VA (why couldn't  they stay in Charlotte anyway?) and there was no run-in with Scarpetta or  Moreno?  Lord knows I couldn't do it any better myself, but still, Cornwell  could have.  I do hope the big three appear again, however, I definitely  hope it is better than this.  PEACE	1999-12-29

Understanding how presidents make policy decisions in the modern political environment can help us understand the constraints operating serious change.  Presidents often feel they have a certain agenda to push through  the system: that is why they were elected.  However, it is far easier said  than done.  Instead of coming up with unique ideas to address the problems  of the country, a president's staff must choose from among policy ideas  that have already been floating around.  Presidents are often forced to  choose between legislative success and good policy - they usually choose  the former at the expense of the latter.  Hence the country is stuck with a  no-win presidency.  This book is well researched through extensive staff  intereviews and first hand accounts of the inner workings of many past  presidencies.  If you have ANY interest in the presidency, this is a  definite book to have on your shelf.	1999-12-11

I read somewhere that people criticize Patterson for being unrealistic.  The criticism is accurate although it should be said approvingly of the Alex Cross novels.  Granted,  there aren't too many doctor psychologists in police forces that are  perfect physical specimens and decide to live in the inner city; but then I  ask, don't we need heroes like Alex Cross?  So what if it is unrealistic!   I can turn on the 11pm news for all of the depressing realities.  Take a  couple hours away from reality and READ THIS BOOK: it is well worth it!  PEACE	1999-11-17

My favorites were McCullough's Truman piece, Doris Kearns' FDR section, Ambrose's Ike selection, and the section on Carter.  While most of the authors are a bit biased towards their president/topic,  they write well and make many good points.  The book is a fast read.   Noonan's piece on Reagan, also incredibly well written, simply bipasses the  Iran-contra scandal with but a mention of what Reagan tried to do for the  Contras.  That is all well and good but it is difficult to read something  about a president's character and the biggest scandal of that president's  administration is conveniently left out.  That would be like discussing  Nixon's character and never bringing up Watergate or mentioning Clinton and  not the Lewinski scandal.  Fact is, those events are integral parts of a  president's tenure.  Such is life; still incredibly fun to read.	1999-06-25

I was not incredibly excited about reading this book as I read less than flattering reviews, however, loving Grisham novels as I do I gave it a shot.  AND IT WAS GREAT!  The story was quite different as it centered on a  recovering alcoholic and addict as he searched out an unsuspecting heir to  a huge fortune.  Nate O'Reilly (the main character) found himself in the  Pantanal of Brazil in search of a woman who did not want to be found.   Meanwhile, back in the States, the other heirs, all greedy underachievers  at best, hired lawyers to stake their claim to a fortune they were  rightfully left out of.  Normally Grisham's tails take us through court  room dramas or other legal excitement but in The Testament, all such legal  matters took a back seat behind an interesting and witty character as he  soul searches and tries to overcome his past.  Don't believe the reviews  and GIVE IT A SHOT!	1999-05-31

I was so thoroughly impressed with this excellent insider's account of the Clinton world.  Perhaps such an eye openning book of a president should not be released while he is still in office, however, Steph. presents an  extremely fair look at President Clinton and does not pull any punches  against himself.  Many advisor tell-alls make large and disingenuous boasts  about how the author was the one true guiding light or was thoroughly  repulsed by the president's behavior; George is honest about his mistakes  and how he often eagerly went along with ethically lacking innovative  political techniques .

While I don't often feel  sympathy for politicians, this book at least lets us know what they have to  go through to become President.  WE COULD REALLY USE A KERRY KILCANNON IN  POLITICS! Also, if anyone is a R.N. Patterson fan, you should read  &quot;Private Screening&quot; and &quot;Silent Witness&quot; as small  aspects of No Safe Place relate to the prior books.

In any other presidential book, one will see  Neustadt's referred to quite often.  As a realist, he describes the  presidency not in terms of how it was designed by the framers.  Neither  does he describe the Constitutional process of accomplishing policy  objectives.  Neustadt explains that the truly effective president uses his  position of authority to persuade others.  FDR, Neustadt's shining example,  knew how to work with people and get them to do his bidding.  Downfall  (and perhaps because I am no brain surgeon): but the book was sometimes  tough to follow, hence it is often boring.  Oh well, perhaps the true  intellectuals will grasp it all.

Mr. Cannon wrote an excellent look into our most overlooked modern President.  President Ford, never considered an &quot;electric&quot; leader, certainly deserves to have his story told.
