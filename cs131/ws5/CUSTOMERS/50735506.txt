Rebecca York, Ann Voss Peterson and Patricia Rosemoor tell three stories so seamlessly it's like reading one story in three parts.  <br />Ten years earlier, a Gypsy was railroaded into a murder conviction.  As revenge, his mother cursed the sons of the three men responsible.  The three younger men have all felt the effects of the curse.  Now, with the Gypsy scheduled to be executed, can they prove his innocence before it's too late?<br />The main couple in Rebecca York's \\"Alessandra,\\" Wyatt Boudreaux and Alessandra King, were once in love.  Then she learned his police chief father helped send her cousin to death row.  They are reunited years later.  They're still on opposite sides of the case, and now Wyatt is blind because of her aunt's curse.  Garner Rousseau, the son of the DA who convicted the Gypsy youth, has also experienced the pain of the curse.  In Ann Voss Peterson story, he joins together with another of the man's cousins, \\"Sabina\\" King.  He knows his father wasn't always ethical.  He doesn't know if he can open his heart to the beautiful Sabina.  Patricia Rosemoor finishes the set in \\"Andrei.\\" Can the title hero and the murdered woman's daughter find the killer before they become the next victims?  <br />\\"Gypsy Magic\\" is the best of the Harlequin anthologies like this I've read.  Others like \\"Night and Day\\" and \\"Final Approach to Forever\\" have had problems keeping the same voice for the characters with the authors? different writing styles.  In \\"Gypsy Magic,\\" the three authors do an excellent job matching their styles and voices to make the stories flow together.  \\"Gypsy Magic\\" is so much better constructed than the earlier Intrigue anthology \\"Bayou Blood Brothers\\" I wish I could go back and lower my rating for that one.  The stories are all equally strong and do a good job advancing the overall storyline while telling each couple's story.  The authors don't miss a step dropping clues that will come in useful in another story.  It takes skill for one author to pull a story like this off and keep everything straight, not to mention three.  <br />\\"Gypsy Magic\\" is one of the best Intrigues this year.	2003-02-04

Even Harper Allen's last one wasn't one of her best.  This one's right up there.<br /><br />\\"The Night in Question\\" is an intense read that combines moving characters and a strong mystery.  Julia and Max are two deeply felt characters with tragedy in their pasts who find the strength and courage to overcome them.  Julia is a gritty and more flawed character than most Intrigue heroines.  That's what makes her so fascinating.  Unlike the heroine of Allen's \\"Protector with a Past,\\" another tortured Julia, this one is easier to relate to and sympathize with.  She's also given a hero in Max with just as much to overcome and as much to gain from love.  The author takes as much care to develop the mystery as she does the romance.  There are plenty of secrets to be uncovered along the way and a good amount of action.  The witness protection angle did strike me as a little off too, but the author has been very meticulous with her research in the past. She included author's notes in her first two books to note changes she'd made and there were parts of \\"The Night in Question\\" that demonstrated she'd done her homework.  I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and go with it.  It's such a little thing I wouldn't let it bother me when there are so many wonderful things in this book.<br /><br />I was about ready to give up on Intrigues after the last few months of so-so books.  I wasn't sure why I was reading them anymore (contrary to popular belief, I don't like writing bad reviews for Intrigues).  This one was wonderful, full of the emotion and mystery the best Intrigues should have.  There might be hope for the line after all.	2003-01-28
US	50735506	R2VLIT0XOPHRH4	0373226837	198686108	Contract Bride (The Colby Agency)	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Contract Bride	Debra Webb's \\"Contract Bride\\" is a fast and entertaining story with an evil villain and nonstop action.  On her wedding day, Dr. Jennifer Ballard's fiance orders her killed, forcing her to go on the run.  She turns to the Colby Agency and Agent Ethan Delaney for help.  Jennifer has no identification and can't prove who she is.  Ethan doesn't know whether to believe her story, or if she's trying to use the agency to cause trouble for the Ballards' pharmaceutical company.  Can she convince him to help her save her and her father from her fiance's evil plan before it's too late?<br /><br />It's interesting.  I had many more problems with \\"Contract Bride\\" than Webb's other books this year, yet I enjoyed it more.  Like most of Webb's heroines lately, Jennifer does some very stupid things for a woman who is supposed to be a genius.  Her uncle bursts into her dressing room, shot in the back, and tells her not to trust her fiance.  What does Jennifer do?  As soon as her fiance comes in, she thinks, \\"Oh, he'll help us!\\"  She's the kind of woman who complains the hero is driving too fast when he's trying to outrun the killers chasing them.  He's trying to save your life.  Why are you complaining?  Ethan is worse.  He's sexist and rude.  He keeps referring to the much younger Jennifer as a little girl at the same time he's lusting after her.  It's a little weird and off-putting, and gives his attraction an almost perverted feeling.<br /><br />The story was still good enough that I got past the characters.  After that opening prologue with Jennifer thinking her murderous fiance is going to help her, I thought I was going to hate this book.  Surprisingly I enjoyed it a great deal.  There are a number of satisfying twists and turns.  The book moves faster than the author's last few, like \\"Personal Protector\\" and \\"Physical Evidence.\\"  The constant action makes for a fun read.  Jennifer may be stupid at times.  She's also tougher and less of a victim than most of Webb's heroines.She shows a good amount of determination and courage. By the end she seems more like a full participant and equal partner in the action than someone waiting around to be saved.  \\"Contract Bride\\" is told with Webb's usual gritty tone.  She has a unique, almost mainstream voice.  That helps heighten the suspense.<br /><br />If I hadn't had so much fun reading the story, I probably would have gotten hung up on the annoying things the characters sometimes did.  Other readers may not be able to do the same.  For me, Contract Bride was a fun read.	2003-01-25
US	50735506	R1YD2S6HACWYCV	0373835310	720309062	What Lies Beneath (Feature Anthology)	Books	4	9	11	N	N	What Lies Beneath	Harlequin presents three very different romantic suspense novellas in \\"What Lies Beneath.\\" From Anne Stuart, we get a highly romantic and atmospheric tale. From Joanna Wayne, a suspense tale with a sweet love story. From Caroline Burnes, a mystery novella with a dash of romance. The authors' voices and styles are so different that I'm not sure any reader will love all the stories equally, as each will appeal to a different reading tastes, but \\"What Lies Beneath\\" serves as a good sampler of the varied styles and types of stories available in romantic suspense.<br /><br />Anne Stuart's \\"The Road to Hidden Harbor\\" is my favorite of the three. In fact, this story is the best thing I've read from her recently, better than her last two full-length novels, \\"The Widow\\" and \\"Still Lake\\" despite being a third as long. She pulled me in from the first paragraph and held me to the page until I'd finished the story in one sitting. It's a relatively simple, character-driven plot that still provided some good twists and suspenseful moments. Jake and Molly are familiar Stuart characters, but better versions than some that we've seen recently. Yes, Molly is inexperienced, but she's also smart and determined. Yes, Jake is dark and secretive, but I loved that he's a real bad boy, not some watered down version. The story has strong conflict between this dangerous man and the woman who doesn't know whether or not she can trust him. One thing I especially liked is the way Stuart captured the magic of good writing and the effect an author's work can have on a reader. While most of us won't have the obsessive reaction Molly does to O'Flannery's work, Stuart proves she's worthy of our admiration and appreciation with this novella. I would have thought this book was worth the cover price based on this story alone. Five Stars<br /><br />Joanna Wayne's \\"Remember Me\\" is more typical. Like the summary up above states, this is another \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\"-type story. Crazy husband. Battered wife on the run. Sensitive protector hero. This is a plot most readers have seen before. The romance was more sweet than passionate, which seemed to make it a poor fit coming after the Anne Stuart story. It does move quickly and goes down easily, but I never got involved in the clichéd storyline. Two Stars.<br /><br />Caroline Burnes's \\"Primal Fear\\" is more mystery/suspense than romance. Readers who don't mind that there's not much of a love story should enjoy this one. The characters don't spend that much time together and their relationship never goes much deeper than flirting, but as a mystery plot it's solid and very original. I liked the unusual setting and storyline that aren't often seen in romantic suspense. Libby the marine biologist and Chad the scavenger/pirate were good characters, and the action-driven story moves with Burnes's usual quick pace and smooth style. \\"Primal Fear\\" also has a pretty good climax where there are two possible bad guys each looking dangerous which keeps the suspense high to the end, even if I did figure out which one was the real villain a little too easily. Still, a good example of this author's work. Four Stars<br /><br />One thing I did appreciate about this collection is that none of the three stories features the usual kind of Harlequin hero, the cop, the PI, the cowboy or the soldier, proving that there are romantic suspense stories to be mined with different types of characters. If only Harlequin was willing to publish more stories like this in its full-length books.<br />\\"What Lies Beneath\\" is a good collection that should appeal to fans of romantic suspense.	2002-09-25

Hired by the uncle of a missing woman to find her, he has no trouble locating the frightened woman.  But nothing he was told prepares him for Hannah Jones.  It doesn't take him long to figure out there's more to the case than he was led to believe, and Hannah is in real danger.  <br />\\"When Lightning Strikes\\" is an okay book.  It gets off to a wonderful beginning, and for the first few chapters I was so glad to have Thurlo back writing for Intrigue, positive I had a five-star read in my hands.  The opening is gritty and interesting, and the first chapter immediately pulled me in with its presentation of Daniel and the secret agency.  The story gets off to a fast start, with events happening at a good clip.  After a while, though, I started to lose interest.  I began to realize that both a lot and very little was happening in this book.<br />I like stories where one event leads to another to keep the story momentum going, or at least where every scene seems vital to the plot.  Here, it felt like Daniel and Hannah were going around and around in circles, doing a great deal but accomplishing very little.   I think the problem is that while \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" is a longer book than most Intrigues today, the plot isn't that complicated.  There aren't very many characters and it's easy to see how the story will end and what they'll figure out.  The big revelations in the end are no surprise.  It didn't need to take the characters nearly as long as it did to put everything together.  For most of the book it felt like they were treading water, and some of the incidents in the middle of the story could have been cut without anything being lost.  It probably would have tightened the story and made it better.  Insteadthis is a book where the destination is visible and we're left wondering what's taking them so long to get there.<br />There also isn't much of a romance.  It's one of those books where the couple falls into bed early on, then decides they can't have a relationship until the mystery is solved, and spends the rest of the book focusing on that.  There's no real sense that they're falling in love over the course of the story.<br />Despite a great beginning, \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" is a too simple storyline stretched out longer than it needed to be.  I like Aimee Thurlo's writing style and am glad that she's writing for Intrigue again.  I didn't really care for this story.  I'm hopeful the next Gray Wolf Pack book, \\"Navajo Justice,\\" will be better.	2002-09-18
US	50735506	R1BU0DP5646PG9	0373226756	960582899	Mystic Isle  (Hidden Passions)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Mystic Isle	Joanna Wayne has an unusual and original story to tell in \\"Mystic Isle.\\" Kathryn Morland comes to New Orleans in search of her missing sister. The trail leads her to the mysterious Mystic Isle, a club whose charismatic owner has a strange pull over his followers. Trying to uncover his connection to her sister, Kathryn finds herself up against the mysterious Roark Lansing. Roark knows she's asking too many questions that will only place her in greater danger. Can he protect her without revealing the truth about himself?<br />It's been almost a year since the last Hidden Passions book, \\"Another Woman's Baby,\\" so I don't really remember if any of these characters were in that book or how the two are connected. \\"Mystic Isle\\" was easy to understand on its own, so I don't think it's necessary to read the other book first. Readers looking for a different kind of romantic suspense book will want to try \\"Mystic Isle.\\" I don't think I've ever read an Intrigue quite like this before. The storyline is different than the normal Intrigue plots these days.  Wayne takes a different approach to her story than we usually see. She doesn't focus only on the hero and heroine, but also shows us what's happening from several other characters' perspectives. This opens up the story more and gives the supporting characters a little more development than we're used to. We get to see everyone with their separate motives and see how one person's decision affects something someone else is doing that they don't know about. It's a neat method that pushes the limits of category and makes \\"Mystic Isle\\" seem almost like a mainstream romantic suspense in its style. <br />At the same time, the romance is somewhat lacking, mostly because the characters are so focused on the suspense plot that falling in love seems like an afterthought. I also never really got a good impression of who Roark was as a person. It is possible to have a mysterious hero who keeps his secrets while still showing enough of his personality to make him a full-blooded character.   I don't think Wayne is completely successful at this. That made it even harder to get involved in the romance. Kathryn is a good heroine though, a determined woman who won't back down when her sister is in danger.<br />\\"Mystic Isle\\" is recommended for readers tired of the same old thing. This book certainly isn't that. Kudos to Joanna Wayne for creating such an unusual, enticing tale for Intrigue readers.	2002-09-11

She instantly finds herself in conflict with Harad Dukhan, who tries to warn her against rushing into a dangerous situation she doesn't understand.  When Amelia is captured in the desert after coming to her sister's rescue, it is the darkly handsome Harad who comes to save her.  Can Amelia resist this powerful man as danger tracks them through the desert?<br />\\"Familiar Oasis\\" is good companion to \\"Familiar Mirage,\\" the rare sequel that is just as good as the original.  Readers who liked book one should like this one too.  I do think anyone who hasn't read the first book should read it first, since it follows what happened in \\"Familiar Mirage\\" and the events and characters of that book are all an important part of the story.  The books don't really stand on their own.  They're like two parts of one whole.<br />\\"Familiar Oasis\\" is not without flaws.  Amelia and Harad seem to go from dislike to love in about a page, there are so few supporting characters the villain is far too obvious, and Familiar doesn't have much to do this time around for most of the book, which may disappoint some diehard fans of the feline detective.  For the most part, he's just tagging along on Amelia and Harad's adventures.  \\"Familiar Oasis\\" is still so much fun readers may not notice.  It has all of Burnes's characteristic touches, with a tough, strong-willed heroine and a fast-moving, action-packed storyline.  The author does a good job of placing Amelia in situations where she needs her desert rescuer without making her seem like any less of a strong woman who knows her own mind.  Harad is a compelling hero, a good combination of modern businessman and desert sheikh.  Interestingly enough, I found him more believable than most romance novel sheikh-types, despite the obvious fantasy elements of the plot.  There's not a dull moment to be found in this larger-than-life adventure.  <br />For fun and passion under the desert sun, \\"Familiar Mirage\\" and \\"Familiar Oasis\\" can't be beat.	2002-09-11

Alex Preston to Tennessee in \\"Physical Evidence.\\"  Investigating the disappearance of a young woman, Alex is attacked and left with amnesia.  Sheriff Mitch Hayden doesn't like a big city investigator coming into his town and asking questions.  Alex is the main suspect in the death of his deputy.  He doesn't trust her, even if he is attracted to her.  Can he keep her from getting herself killed before he can uncover the truth?<br /><br />I've had varying reactions to Webb's other books, not caring for some of her stories, though her writing was always strong.  This is the first one that fell pretty flat.  \\"Physical Evidence\\" is hindered by a foolish heroine, an obvious villain, and a lack of chemistry between the characters.  It's hard to take serious the claim that the Colby Agency hires only \\"the best\\" (and Webb lays it on pretty thick, right down to the last line) when they have someone like Alex working for them, who makes many bad choices.  Worse, she makes more and more of them as the book goes on.  Just when I thought she couldn't do anything dumber than the last thing she did, she does!  The ending in particular had me shaking my head.  Anyone who has a major clue and the entire truth practically thrown in their face and doesn't even notice is a terrible investigator.<br /><br />Unlike the author's previous books, I never felt the attraction between the main characters, so the usual sex scene seemed to come out of nowhere.  Mitch spends so much time thinking about how he was attracted to Alex before the murder and what happened between them then that the author never really shows how he's attracted to her now.  The sex is hot.  Everything that comes before it is not.  The story is fast-paced, but predictable, and I had the villain pegged within a few chapters.  You'd think if I could figure it out so soon, an agent from the incredible Colby Agency could too.  No such luck.  It's also interesting to note that Alex is only the second female agent we've seen working for the Colby Agency, and the last one got amnesia on her case too (in \\"Safe By His Side\\").  Hmmmmm.<br /><br />Lacking in the white-knuckle suspense of \\"The Bodyguard's Baby\\" or the powerful romance of \\"Personal Protector,\\" \\"Physical Evidence\\" is far from this author's best work.	2002-08-29

As they work together to uncover his identity, it becomes clear someone wants him dead.  If this is her husband, has she been reunited with him, only to face losing him again?<br />I was skeptical about this story at first.  This is the fifth Intrigue in six months with this premise (man who looks like woman's presumed dead true love appears) and the Texas ranch setting and amnesia plot device are things most romance readers have seem a million times by now, making this seem like the same old story.  In the case of such a familiar tale, what matters is how it's told.  Fortunately Blake has a strong storytelling voice that drew me into the book almost against my will and kept me involved.  Her characters are compelling and sympathetic, and though they make some choices that defy logic at times, I never thought they were stupid.  (I'd rather see characters being overly cautious than foolishly reckless).  Her writing and pacing are unusually smooth for a first-time writer.  If she hasn't been published before, then she is an amazingly polished debut author.  A good cast of secondary characters add to the drama in a story that is a solid blend of romance and mystery.  The best thing I can say is that I was so unexcited about this book that had to make myself pick it up to read it, and once I did I never put it down.  A good one-sitting read.<br />Anyone who's not too tired of stories like this might want to try \\"Would-Be Wife\\" to discover an author worth watching.	2002-08-29

Texas oilman Quint Crawford comes to Chicago to help the new branch on a case.  An oil company has come under attack by tourists, and his job is to protect independent PR woman Natalie Van Buren, daughter of the company's president.  Can he keep her safe from a devious assassin while fighting his own powerful attraction for the feisty lady?    \\"Not on His Watch\\" was a book I really wanted to like.  I usually like Cassie Miles's books.  I loved her \\"Wedding Captives\\" earlier this year.  This book wasn't a mindless 250-page chase the way the first Texas Confidential and Montana Confidential books were, even if it was another bodyguard book, just like those were.  It had a real plot.  \\"Not on His Watch\\" has the same premise as another Intrigue from a few months ago, \\"Personal Protector,\\" where the hero goes undercover to protect a heroine who doesn't want a bodyguard, but it fixes the one thing that drove me crazy about that book.  Unlike the heroine of \\"Personal Protector,\\" Natalie not only says she can take care of herself, she gets to show that she's not all talk.  There are so many reasons why I should have liked this book.      There was one problem.  It was so boring.  I usually read an Intrigue in a few hours, a day at most.  I started \\"Not on His Watch\\" on a Sunday and made myself finish it the next Saturday.  I kept putting it down and not wanting to pick it back up for a whole week.  The story was very hard to get into.  Like many opening books in a series, such as the first Moriah's Landing book in February, this book has to setup everything for the whole series.  The plot the editors have come up with for \\"Chicago Confidential\\" is way too convoluted.  Miles's first chapter, where she has the agents sit down and explain all this stuff about Middle Eastern bad guys and twin princes and oil interests was so far-fetched and over-complicated I knew I wasn't catching most of it and I really didn't care enough to go back and reread it.      I also never really cared about Quint and Natalie, two perfect people without any flaws.  While the villain is chilling, the story moves slowly.  Very slowly.  It does pick up steam after a while, though, and the last section of the book is incredibly tense and exciting, if a little uncomfortable to read about after September 11th.      The other Confidential series started off with weak books and improved.  Hopefully this series will get better too.	2002-07-29

Instead she is kidnapped and held for ransom.   She knows better than to trust Cade St. John, the most mysterious of her kidnappers.  Can she resist this dangerous man she can't help being drawn to?<br />\\"The Duke's Covert Mission\\" had some good points and weak points.  The best part of the story is the wonderful beginning.  Dramatic and suspenseful, Miller immediately made me feel for her heroine, then plunges the reader straight into a terrifying situation.  Ellie is a great, unusual heroine.  I liked how she was a shy, regular woman who still fought back when her life was in danger.  She comes across as stronger than many trained cop or secret agent heroines I've read recently.   Many authors tell us their heroine are strong women but show them as victims the hero has to save over and over again.  That's not the case with Ellie.  She may have had a sheltered childhood and no training, but she rises to the occasion when her life is in danger the way a true heroine does.   This book also features a gritty, suspenseful tone and tense scenes Miller's last book, \\"In the Blink of an Eye\\" lacked.<br />Despite the great opening and unique characters, I slowly lost interest as the story went along.  While this book features some crisp, taut writing and exciting action scenes, it is also very repetitive and doesn't seem to go anywhere.  She tries to get away.  He catches her.  She tries to get away.  He catches her.  That's all that really happens.  I'm not sure if the author or her editor was afraid of writing too complicated a story that would turn off American Romance readers used to more simple tales, but \\"The Duke's Covert Mission\\" is a very simple story with no twists or surprises.  The hero and heroine really aren't eveninvolved in investigating who's behind the kidnapping, and the mastermind's identity is easy to figure out.  Miller's strong storytelling carried me through the first half of this book, but the second half was harder to get through.  There really wasn't enough to the story to hold my interest.<br />Miller's fans and anyone who wants to find out how the Carridigne series ends won't want to miss \\"The Duke's Covert Mission.\\"  Readers who like meaty stories with twists and surprises may want to pass.	2002-07-15

Can a certain feline detective play matchmaker and help Beth find who poses a bigger threat to her mission, and her life?<br />\\"Familiar Mirage\\" is a very different kind of Intrigue, a larger-than-life tale that sweeps readers into a grand adventure.  Taking place entirely in a foreign setting (finally!), it's the perfect story for readers looking for a fun escape.   It's not a very deep book, but it is loads of fun.<br />Burnes has come up with some interesting details that take advantage of her exotic locale in a story that is a welcome change of pace.  The conflict between Omar and Beth adds to the drama.  He has vowed to his people that he will keep the city a secret.  If she doesn't find it, her professional reputation will be destroyed.  This isn't one of those stupid misunderstandings, but a real conflict that leaves you wondering how they'll work through it.  The author keeps readers on their toes trying to figure out who's a bad guy and who's not, until it doesn't look like anyone can be trusted.  No one does strong heroines like Burnes, women who refuse to back down in the face of adversity, women who don't cry and wait for the hero to save them, and Beth's determination makes her worth rooting for.

She makes him feel things he hasn't for years, but can she be trusted?<br />\\"From the Shadows\\" is an unusual and unique Intrigue story.  Readers eager for something different will find it here.  An interesting puzzle with constant action and good twists, \\"From the Shadows\\" should keep readers guessing.  Although Sara often seems stranded on the sidelines during this story, more of a supporting character than a heroine, and the romance is slight, Rebecca York has a fresh, intriguing story to tell.	2002-07-15

That night on the Red Thunder River left him with severe injuries and a new face.  No one recognizes him, not even Ellen Paxton, the woman he always loved.  Ellen needs his help more than ever.  With a dangerous villain targeting her ranch, can she rely on a familiar stranger?<br />\\"Red Thunder Reckoning\\" is a good follow-up to \\"Remembering Red Thunder,\\" though not as extraordinary.  Anybody who hasn't read the first book should read it before this one or you might not understand everything.  I don't think this book would have been as easy to follow if I hadn't read the other a few weeks before.  <br />The best part of \\"Red Thunder Reckoning\\" is the strong, emotional romance between Kevin and Ellen.  Both are wonderful characters, two tough, determined people hiding wounds that only the other person can heal.  Ellen is another great heroine who has been through a nightmare (in book one) and now isn't about to stand by and let someone terrorize her life again.  Unlike some of the other heroines in this month's Intrigues, there's a good reason for her stubbornness and refusal to back down, so she comes across as strong, not stupid.  Kurtz does a good job building the chemistry between Kevin and Ellen, so we can feel how they are meant to be together and how strong their connection is.  This is an excellent romance.<br />Unfortunately the suspense plot is not as strong.  The author told us who the villain was in \\"Remembering Red Thunder\\" from the very beginning and it really added to the suspense.  She does the same thing in \\"Red Thunder Reckoning\\" and it doesn't work so well because this villain is nowhere near as scary.  So there's not as much suspense.  Plus, by constantly taking us into this person's point of view and showing us what is being planned before it happens, it took some of the surprise out of what was going to happen next.  However, the author has come up with a very creative motive for the intrigue that most readers won't have seen before.  Her characters will keep readers eagerly turning the pages to see them triumph in the end.<br />\\"Red Thunder Reckoning\\" is a wonderful story and a good ending to the saga started in \\"Remembering Red Thunder.\\"	2002-06-24

Tara Ford has tried to get on with her life after testifying against her former boss.  Then U.S. Marshal Brad Harrison comes to tell her that the other five witnesses in the trial have all been killed.  She's the only one left.  Brad vows to protect her.  Can he resist his attraction to the vulnerable beauty long enough to figure out who is after her?  <br />\\"In His Safekeeping\\" was an acceptable read.  It wasn't a terrible book.  It wasn't a good one either.  The beginning is awkward and I had trouble getting into the story.  This is another book where the characters feel an instant attraction and immediately begin fixating on the other person's body.  Sometimes it can work.  Here it felt too forced and unbelievable.  The author tells us they are attracted to each other instead of showing it or making me feel it.  Tara is also a very weak heroine, both foolish and naïve.  Some of the information she withholds from Brad because she doesn't think it is relevant is so obvious I had to shake my head in disbelief.  The setup is also slightly unbelievable and the story is occasionally hard to follow.<br />On the plus side, \\"In His Safekeeping\\" improves on the fatal flaw of Delacorte's last Intrigue, \\"Secret Lover,\\" where so much time was spent on the secondary characters that the hero and heroine weren't a big part of the story.  Here the focus is mainly on Tara and Brad.  Delacorte does a reasonably good job keeping the suspects balanced so any one of them could be the guilty party.  \\"In His Safekeeping\\" is an okay book, but not one I can recommend.	2002-06-24

For five years, Catherine Erickson believed her fiancé, Ryan Christopher, was killed in an embassy bombing.  She raised their daughter alone on her family's Montana ranch, until a mysterious stranger appeared in her life.  He said he was a friend of Ryan's.  So why hadn't she ever heard of him?  Trace Gallagher couldn't reveal his true identity without putting Catherine in danger.  Can he keep her safe without breaking her heart?<br />\\"Montana Secrets\\" was an okay story, but nothing special.  It's a well-written book.  The story moves quickly and the storytelling is smooth.  The characters are charming, the emotions feel real, and while there isn't much actual suspense for most of the book, the story is engaging enough to keep readers turning the pages. <br />I think I would have enjoyed \\"Montana Secrets\\" more if I hadn't read the last few months of Intrigues first.  This is the fourth month in a row where one of the Intrigues has been about a presumed dead man returning to the woman he loved.  Linda O. Johnston's \\"Operation Reunited,\\" Intrigue 655, was the most suspenseful and dramatic.  Sylvie Kurtz's \\"Red Thunder Reckoning,\\" Intrigue 657, had the richest characters.  Harper Allen's \\"The Bride and the Mercenary,\\" Intrigue 663, was the most romantic.   All of those books had something that made them feel a little different and special. \\"Montana Secrets\\" didn't.  By throwing in amnesia AND a secret child AND the Montana ranch setting, the author really makes this seem like the same old story most of us have read before.  <br />There's really nothing wrong with \\"Montana Secrets.\\"  It's a nice book.  There just wasn't anything that made it stand out and a little too much that made it feel like a story I'd read before.  It's a little too predictable, a little too familiar.  Readers who haven't read stories like this before and Douglas's fans should enjoy it more than I did.  I would haveto recommend any of those other books before this one.	2002-06-24

Now he's back, at the same time as Lindsey Warner, the girl who pursued him relentlessly in their youth.  He was too old for her then.  He's not now.  Sparks fly between them until a series of murders begin, placing them both in danger.  Can they unmask a killer before they become the next victims?<br />Childs has come up with a solid story in \\"Return of the Lawman,\\" with a tangle of old secrets and revelations for readers to try to solve with the characters.  I love this kind of story, with an intricate mystery that shows the author spent more than five minutes coming up with her plot.  Everybody in this small Michigan town has a secret and a hidden motive, and readers will have fun trying to figure out who can be trusted.  There are some good atmospheric elements, and the author delivers a story that offers both chills and emotion.  <br />While the story was strong, \\"Return of the Lawman\\" did have some rough spots that weakened the story at times and made it a difficult read.  Some of the transitions were jarring and there were times the author tries to surprise the reader that were more confusing than shocking.  Dylan is a good hero, strong and sensible, though I had some trouble with Lindsey.  Many of her actions seem inappropriate with what's happening around her.  When a doctor is talking to her about her mother in a hospital and Lindsey's busy making goo-goo eyes at Dylan down the hallway, all I can think is she needs to rethink her priorities.  Often she seems to be thinking with her hormones instead of her head, and much of the time I didn't understand her choices and her reactions toward what is happening around her.  <br />The author shows a flair for interesting stories that are too rare in Intrigues these days.  I expect she'll only get better inupcoming books.  \\"Return of the Lawman\\" was good enough that I look forward to them.	2002-06-24

Throwing caution to the wind, she goes after him.  Soon she finds herself on the run with a man with no memory, running from assassins who will stop at nothing until he's dead.  Can Ainslie convince him he knows her, when she's no longer sure she knew him at all?<br /><br />\\"The Bride and the Mercenary\\" is a solid tale by this author, though it doesn't rank with her best.  It features most of the elements her fans have come to expect from her:  nonstop action, creative storytelling, a strong-willed heroine and a highly romantic tone.  Allen fills her story with many inventive touches that make it unique.  I loved Seamus's hideaway.  I loved that Ainslie was a boxer.  I loved that she had an adopted daughter, but that the kid wasn't a big part of the story.  It was just part of the heroine's character.  I love the attention the author gives to minor characters we meet along the way.  Witness how fleshed out the hero's former partner is in a few pages compared to how some authors can fail to develop their characters in entire books.<br /><br />That said, I didn't enjoy \\"The Bride and the Mercenary\\" as much as the first two Avengers books.  If those books were fantastic, this one was only very good.  It was somewhat disappointing to see the third book in this series be an amnesia story when the first Avengers tale, \\"Guarding Jane Doe\\" was also an amnesia book.  Seeing amnesia strike twice in such a small group of people, let alone the first and third books in a series, is a little far-fetched for me.  Just like in GJD, the amnesiac here is convinced he must be a bad person and a murderer, though this conflict is much more frustrating and exhausting than it was in the earlier book.  It's also a little too easy to predict what's really going on and most readers will figure out who the villain is early on, though the road there is filled with unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of Allen's books is that unlike many romance novels these days, they are romantic.  They aren't just two people with a lot of sexual chemistry or a lot in common who get to know each other over 250 pages and decide to get married in the end.  Allen's books have such a strong sense of romantic atmosphere that the reader can truly feel these are two people who are meant to be together.  This is one author who manages to capture the magic of falling in love.  Her heroines are some of the best around and her heroes are strong, honorable men any woman would fall for.<br /><br />While \\"The Bride and the Mercenary\\" wasn't as surprising as the author's other books, it was a pleasure to read, being swept up in the action and emotion of good romantic suspense.	2002-05-31
US	50735506	R2FXX32MP8YLY6	0373226624	992251471	Behind the Veil	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Behind the Veil	Joanna Wayne, who wrote the weakest of the Texas Confidential books, delivers the best of the Moriah's Landing books in \\"Behind the Veil,\\" the finale of Intrigue's modern gothic series.  Newcomer Becca Smith has been fascinated by David Bryson since she first came to town.  The reclusive doctor lives in an isolated castle on the edge of town.  He was scarred in the accident that killed his fiancée and some of the townspeople say it wasn't an accident.  Becca knows she shouldn't get involved with the mysterious man, especially when a serial killer begins to murder young women in town.  Can she resist the powerful allure he has on her?  Does she want to?<br />Of the four Moriah's Landing authors, Wayne does the best job of mimicking the gothic tone her story calls for.  The tone is dark and mysterious.  It may be too melodramatic and over the top for some readers, but that's how gothics are.  Becca is a good heroine.  She is strong and courageous.  Like most gothic heroes, David remains somewhat mysterious and we don't get to know him too well.  Anyone looking for the moody hero who lurks in the shadows and the young, too-trusting heroine who is drawn to him will find what they are looking for here.  <br />At the same time, the story does move slowly and I felt the author could have cut some of it without losing much.  It seems to go on and on without getting anywhere for too long.  After a while I grew so weary of Claire's whining, David's moodiness, and the townspeople's over-the-top screeching about how evil David was, my patience ran out.  If I was Becca, I would have left town and gotten away from all these nutcases.  I also could have done without the constant Beauty and the Beast references that seemed to push the theme too hard.  I think most readers would have gotten the point without the characters comparing themselves to Beauty and the Beast.  It took me out of the story for those moments.<br />Gothic fans should enjoy \\"Behind the Veil,\\" though readers who've read enough of them may have read this particular story many times before.  There's not much new here, just a revival of the old gothic clichés without anything fresh thrown in.  However, the strength of the writing and the good atmosphere makes sure this is one nod toward the gothic romances of old that is very well done.	2002-05-31

When Jane Grantham and her prize horse are attacked, Curran comes from Ireland to see if the horse he trained can be saved.  He doesn't expect to be drawn to the horse's fiery owner, a woman he instinctively knows is in danger.  Jane needs the crazed horse to run in an upcoming race that could save her farm.  She doesn't want to admit she needs the mysterious Irishman.  She doesn't have a choice when the attacker begins to stalk her again.<br />\\"Mysterious Stranger\\" is Rosemoor's best Intrigue since \\"Cowboy Justice\\" three years ago.  It's not as extraordinary as the first four McKenna books, some of her all time best, but a definite improvement over some recent efforts.  While the mystery is somewhat muddled and easy to figure out, there's a good sense of danger lurking around every corner.  The romance is very strong.  Both characters are well developed with their own reasons for not wanting to get involved and we see them grow and get used to one another over the course of the book.  This isn't the kind of story where they're immediately falling into bed.  It feels more natural, as we get to see initial attraction lead to something deeper and more meaningful.  Jane is no weepy ninny, but a tough woman with a vulnerable side.  Fans of Nora Roberts-style Irish heroes or anyone who likes a real Irish charmer should find Curran appealing.  Both are thoroughly likable and their romance is charming.<br />The McKenna Legacy is in full effect as Rosemoor delivers a magical tale that will please fans who've been waiting for this story and send newcomers searching for the other books, \\"See Me in Your Dreams,\\" \\"Tell Me No Lies,\\" \\"Touch Me in the Dark,\\" and \\"Never Cry Wolf.\\"	2002-05-31
US	50735506	R1OY3UMHHTUH5G	0373226594	885375945	Personal Protector (The Colby Agency)	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Personal Protector	Debra Webb's Colby Agency takes on another case in \\"Personal Protector,\\" when Ric Martinez is called in to protect Atlanta reporter Piper Ryan.  A terrorist group is killing reporters who aired negative stories on them, and Piper is on the list.  Ric goes undercover as Piper's cameraman to keep close to her.  Can he save the life of a woman he's also drawn to with a fierce passion?<br /><br />This is another expertly written tale by Webb, an author with a strong, sure voice and a true way with words.  The characters and the romance in \\"Personal Protector\\" are flawless.  Ric and Piper are both fully-fleshed, realistic people who come to life for the reader.  There is real character conflict they must overcome and strong development in their relationship.  The sexual chemistry is high and the love scenes sizzle.  This is a romance to thrill.<br /><br />At the same time, the suspense in \\"Personal Protector\\" is so frustrating that I had to keep putting the book down to keep from getting too annoyed.  From the start I had basic questions about the premise that went unanswered for a long time.  For instance, it was almost a hundred pages in before Webb revealed that this was a domestic terrorist group and what their cause was.  It could be a sign of our times that I would assume that a terrorist group would be foreign.  This does seem to be a basic element that should have been spelled out at the start.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Personal Protector\\" is that the plot development is too contrived.  This isn't a story where we wonder how the villains will strike next.  It's one where we wonder how the heroine will put herself in danger this time.  It bothered me to no end that so many of the threats to Piper were avoidable.  The only reason they took place was because of Piper's insistence on putting herself in dangerous situations.  Ric tells her over and over that she should not be doing certain things.  He keeps warning her about safety and makes suggestions that make perfect sense.  She never listens.  I wanted to shake her and say \\"Listen to him!\\"  Perhaps I'm not driven enough to think a career is more important than staying alive.  I couldn't work up much sympathy for a woman who thought that way.  When he's trying to keep her alive and all she cares about is getting an interview, my patience ran out.  The best and worst example comes near the end.  The climax of \\"Personal Protector\\" is very creative and exciting, but again, Ric saw it coming.  It was avoidable.  He made a specific point to Piper that would have prevented it from happening.  But no, Piper blows off his concern.  While very tense and frightening, I couldn't completely get into the final action sequence because I kept thinking, \\"This didn't have to happen.\\"  If Piper hadn't been so stubborn, it wouldn't have.  There's a problem with a suspense plot when the heroine does more to set up the danger than the villains do. She reminds me of those dumb girls in horror movies who are always running right toward the killer when the audience knows she should be going the other way.  Then the audience doesn't feel bad for her, they cheer because she's so stupid she's getting exactly what she deserves.  Reading the story became like anticipating a train crash you know doesn't have to happen but can't stop.  I grew weary seeing this woman throw herself into dangerous situations again and again.  She was asking for every terrible thing that happened to her.<br /><br />Although \\"Personal Protector\\" is one of the best-written Intrigues of the year, I couldn't lose myself in the story.  Some readers may not have the same problem.  I know many people enjoyed Webb's \\"Protective Custody,\\" where I thought the supposedly strong heroine was merely stupid for placing herself in danger over and over and over again and insisting she didn't need the hero to keep her safe when her actions said she did.  \\"Personal Protector\\" has the same problem, though without the nasty edge and downright meanness between the hero and heroine.  One of the pleasures of \\"Personal Protector,\\" and there are many of them, is the way the characters' initial hostility gives way to a meaningful, emotional love story.<br /><br />\\"Personal Protector\\" is a book that can be enjoyed for its romance, good characters and sensual scenes.  This is a rare Intrigue where the couple meet, have personal issues to overcome in their relationship and convince us their love will last.  Some readers may find the suspense more frustrating than satisfying.  Beautifully written, I thought for a while this would be Webb's best book yet.  For me it needed more of a plot than \\"What stupid thing is Piper going to do now?\\"	2002-04-25

The only man she can turn to is Trevor Sloan.  Sloan's wife and son were killed by the assassin called Angel.  Can he open his heart to this woman and the son of his mortal enemy?<br /><br />\\"Solitary Soldier\\" is a story that should appeal to readers who like their romantic suspense heavy on the romance and light on the suspense.  After a promising beginning, \\"Solitary Soldier\\" turns out to be a story with little action and minimal plot, where the characters do little more than sit around and wait for the villain to show up.  There's no mystery because we know who the villain is and what his motives are from the start.  There's little suspense because almost nothing happens in this story.  He teaches her self-defense.  They argue.  They have sex.  Except for one action sequence, this book's middle sags horribly.  The story comes to a complete halt for almost forty pages where the characters do nothing but have sex, then worry about their growing feelings, then have more sex.  However, readers who enjoy steamy sex scenes and good character development should find plenty to like here.  We are allowed to see Sloan and Rachel fall in love and grow into their relationship.  It is a very convincing romance about two people opening their hearts to one another.  Too bad the romance isn't developed with the suspense.  It overwhelms it.<br /><br />\\"Solitary Soldier\\" isn't helped by its scheduling.  Once again, the Intrigue editors have scheduled very similar books back-to-back.  Regular readers may find this story contains too many similarities to December's \\"Lassiter's Law\\" by Rebecca York.  Fragile heroine desperate to hide a young boy from his murderous father.  Tortured hero who lost it after the death of his wife and child, turned to drinking, and who has a score to settle with the boy's father.  The difference is that book is action packed and has some big surprises along the way.  For me the impact was lessened because I felt like I had just read this story a month ago.<br /><br />Webb's growing number of fans should enjoy this tale.  Personally I would recommend Gayle Wilson's \\"The Stranger She Knew,\\" Intrigue 513, a story about a desperate mother forced to depend on a dangerous man that manages to be emotional and romantic without losing track of the sense of danger, instead.	2002-04-25

In the fifteen years since he was rescued from the Red Thunder River, battered and with no memory, Chance Conover has made a life in Gabenburg, Texas.  He is now the town sheriff and is married to his beautiful wife Taryn.  But one day an accident leads him to forget who he is again and sends him searching for the truth of his past.  Refusing to give up on the man she loves, Taryn goes with him.  Can she save him from the dangerous secrets he uncovers before they destroy him?<br />\\"Remembering Red Thunder\\" is an amazing tale, the kind of rare, once in a lifetime romance novel that will move readers with the depths of this couple's love.  Add a tense and exciting suspense plot and this story cannot be beat.  Although Kurtz demonstrated she was a strong writer in her previous Intrigues, her stories were never as good as her voice.  \\"One Texas Night\\" was repetitive, slow and obvious.  \\"Blackmailed Bride\\" had some sizeable plot holes.  \\"Alyssa Again\\" was mechanical, predictable and ignored too many relevant character issues.  All three had some glaring plot flaws in the setup.  Based on those three books, I never would have imagined she was capable of writing a book with this much complexity, emotion and white knuckle suspense.  Finally her storytelling catches up with her voice. <br />The biggest strength of \\"Remembering Red Thunder\\" is its heroine.  Taryn is an amazing heroine:  strong, determined and courageous.  She loves her man with all her heart and will stand by him and fight for their marriage through everything they face.  If romance heroes are the men we all want to be with, romance heroines are the women we should all want to be.  Few are.  They're usually wimpy or wishy washy or insecure.  This is one of the few romance heroines to deserve the title of heroine.  The strength of her character and the depth of her love are amazing to read about.  This is a heroine to cheer for.  It seems like everyone is out to stop her.  The good guys tell her to give up.  An entire small town and a very evil villain will do anything to stop her.  She keeps fighting.  It's a shame the hero can't quite match her.  Chance is a frustrating \\"hero.\\"  His attitude is too often defeatist and some of his actions are inexplicable.  \\"Be reasonable,\\" Taryn tells him late in the book.  I laughed out loud.  He'd given no sign in this book he was capable of that.  However, this also makes the story more suspenseful because Taryn is given overwhelming odds to overcome.  <br />\\"Remembering Red Thunder\\" is a unique story for Intrigue because Kurtz reveals who the villain is from the very beginning.  This adds to the suspense because the villain is truly evil.  There's not much of a mystery here, only which of two missing twin brothers Chance will turn out to be, and astute readers should be able to guess it easily.  The nonstop action and unbearable tension should still keep readers anxiously turning the pages to see how the characters will triumph over so much adversity.<br />\\"Remembering Red Thunder\\" is an amazing story full of passion, emotion and action that shouldn't be missed for any reason.	2002-04-25

Now she has received a hearing implant through an experimental technique.  When she first wakes up after the surgery she hears more than she expects:  the screams of a woman being kidnapped.  The doctors tell her she was dreaming or that the device was malfunctioning.  Sarah knows what she heard.  Her search for answers leads her to Detective Adam Black, whose sister has disappeared.  Denise was a research scientist on Nighthawk Island.  Did she hear his sister, and can they work together to find her before it is too late?    The editor's letter inside the front cover claims this story is \\"truly innovative.\\"  It's not.  The basic idea is the same that Herron did in an earlier Intrigue, \\"Her Eyewitness.\\"  In that one, a blind man received a cornea transplant and saw a murder.  In this one, a deaf woman receives a hearing implant and hears a kidnapping.  This book does make better use of the gimmick.  While \\"Her Eyewitness\\" only used it in the beginning and end and told a regular story in between, \\"Silent Surrender\\" has Sarah \\"hear\\" the woman throughout the book.  However, like \\"Her Eyewitness,\\" this is a story where I knew who the villains were early on and was left sitting through all the filler until that predictable ending came along.  The villain may as well be given horns and a pitchfork, this person is so obviously baaaaad!  And both books are about the cutthroat development of medical products.  \\"Her Eyewitness\\" has pharmaceuticals.  \\"Silent Surrender\\" has medical research.  It's an interesting idea, but this book isn't innovative at all.  It's a retread.  I would recommend \\"Her Eyewitness\\" over \\"Silent Surrender.\\"  It was a better book.    Unfortunately, \\"Silent Surrender\\" contains none of the elements that made \\"Saving His Son\\" strong and too many of the ones that made her earlier Intrigues weak.  Gone is the gritty writing and strong heroine of \\"Saving His Son.\\"  The worst part of \\"Silent Surrender\\" is Sarah.  I can't even call her a heroine.  There is nothing heroic about her.  Sarah is so fragile she comes off as pathetic.  She seems to do nothing in this book but cry and sob and have tears in her eyes.  This is her reaction to her first, very brief sexual thought about the hero:  \\"Shaken by her own thoughts, her legs threatened to buckle so she clutched the wall for support.\\" (Page 39).   What a ninny.  A regency heroine might be able to get away with being such a delicate flower.  What modern woman reacts to one little sexual thought like that?  Oh no!  Sex!  I'm going to pass out!  Her absolute lowest moment comes when Adam and Sarah break into an apartment to search for clues.  Sarah feels tired, so Adam tells her she can take a nap.  She does!  He searches for clues.  She lies down on the sofa and falls asleep!  Why did she come along and commit a crime in breaking into the place only to take a nap?  That's a good indication how useless she is and it's when I officially gave up on her.  I don't know what the author has against strong heroines but it's women like Sarah that give romance heroines an bad name.      Adam isn't that much better, the kind of self-pitying, self-sacrificing mope whose routine lasts only long enough to delay the happy ending.  \\"Silent Surrender\\" is readable, though one jaw-droppingly awful moment revolving around Eric Clapton's \\"Tears in Heaven\\" had me laughing out loud.  It's the kind of forced sappy moment that is unforgivable.  Herron does keep the action coming at a constant rate, so the story at least passes quickly and isn't boring.  She's also one of the few new Intrigue authors who tries to provide a mystery her heroes, if not her heroines, investigate.  If only her villains weren't so easily identifiable.      \\"Silent Surrender\\" looks to be the first in a new series about Nighthawk Island.  Hopefully the author will be generous enough to give the heroines of those books some spine.	2002-04-25

This is a story whose success depends on the reader's expectations.  Those looking for a good police procedural type story should be pleased.  Those wanting a good gothic and paranormal flavored story may be disappointed.<br /><br />Undercover FBI agent Jonah Ries returns to his hometown of Moriah's Landing to investigate the disappearance of a fellow agent in the town.  There he meets P.I. Kat Ridgemont.  Years ago, Kat's mother was murdered by a serial killer who struck in Moriah's Landing and was never caught.  As soon as he meets her, Jonah knows Kat is in danger.  Can he protect her and himself from the dangers that are after them both?<br /><br />As a procedural detective story, \\"Howling in the Darkness\\" is strong.  In terms of her mystery plotting, this is Daniels's best book in over a year, since \\"The Agent's Secret Child.\\"  There are several different storylines all happening at once, with Jonah's investigation, Kat's danger, and her own investigations into several of her cases.  All these storylines develop and finally intersect.  There's a real plot here with some meat to it.  Mystery readers should enjoy trying to figure out how everything is connected.  This approach also allows Daniels to do something Amanda Stevens didn't do last month in book one, \\"Secret Sanctuary.\\"  She gives us a real sense of the town of Moriah's Landing and all the relationships and secrets between the townspeople.  That's part of the charm of a small town setting, seeing how everyone is connected and the little dramas between them.  Daniels makes Moriah's Landing and its townspeople seem vivid.<br /><br />As the modern gothic the cover promises, \\"Howling in the Darkness\\" disappoints.  This is really only a regular Intrigue with a few paranormal elements thrown on top.  They could easily be removed and the basic story would be the same.  For instance, Jonah is given a hint of supernatural powerbut it is barely defined and a small part of the story.  Unlike Amanda Stevens last month, Daniels is not an author who is natural for this kind of story.  She may have been in her early books, like the wonderful gothic-influenced \\"Undercover Christmas.\\"  Ever since, her storytelling \\"voice\\" has become light and breezy, which is the exact opposite of the kind of tone a gothic or paranormal needs.  She keeps mentioning the creeping fog and threatening shadows but it isn't enough to create a convincing atmosphere.  It doesn't feel authentic.  The way Jonah and Kat meet, where he pretends to be the blind date she met online, is an example of how wrong the tone is.  It's \\"cute,\\" even a little \\"funny.\\"  That's what Daniels's readers will expect from her (especially if they read the blind date scene that started \\"Love at First Sight\\").  But that's not dark, suspenseful or remotely gothic, and no matter how much creeping fog Daniels throws on top of it, it's never going to be.  What \\"Howling in the Darkness\\" is missing is the darkness.  There are some authors who can really make the reader feel how dark and scary the story is, like Amanda Stevens, Jenna Ryan and others.  Daniels is not one of them.  She excels at lighter, even humorous romantic suspense, and she keeps this one that way instead of as dark as it needs to be to be convincing.<br /><br />The romance is also underwhelming.  It moves slowly and is not very developed.  In the first half of the book I don't think Kat and Jonah spend more than 15 pages together.  They're both so busy investigating their separate storylines.  They do spend more time together in the second half.  Until then, the romance is barely present.  This adds to the sense that this is more a procedural than a gothic romance.<br /><br />\\"Howling in the Darkness\\" is ably told with well-crafted scenes and good characters.  It's a solid procedural tale. It's also not much of a modern gothic.also not much of a modern gothic.	2002-03-21

Her family doesn't take her seriously as a PI and her sexy rival Dallas McFarland keeps stealing her cases.  When they are hired by different people to investigate the same murder case, Christy is forced to work with Dallas.  They're going to need each other with this case, a mystery involving voodoo and murder with a killer who is soon after them.  As the bodies pile up and the danger builds, can Christy and Dallas keep their focus on the challenging case and not their growing attraction, before it is too late?<br />\\"Private Investigations\\" is another strong entry for the Hawke agency.  Though there is no mention of it on the cover or inside the book, this is the second book in Barrett's Hawke Detective Agency series.  Book one is \\"The Hunt for Hawke's Daughter\\" (Intrigue 605).  That was a more dramatic tale.  This is more of a fun, fast paced romp, though it does have plenty of dark suspense. The strength of \\"Private Investigations\\" is the banter between Christy and Dallas.  Christy is feisty and smart mouthed.  Dallas is brash and larger than life.  Barrett keeps the comments flying between them, and their chemistry is strong.  Readers who enjoy that quick back-and-forth relationship between two smart, funny people should enjoy this story.  Although Dallas starts out getting the better of Christy, Barrett comes to show that they are equals who work well together in every way.  The case puts them into some suspenseful situations  while keeping the focus on their relationship.  One perfectly advances the other in this well-plotted tale.  Only a subplot involving Dallas's hidden motives for wanting to investigate this case is tiresome and overly predictable.<br />Overall \\"Private Investigations\\" is a fun and entertaining novel from this talented writer.  Romantic suspense fans shouldn't miss it.	2002-03-21

Johnston finally gets it right in her third Intrigue, \\"Operation: Reunited,\\" easily the best book she's written for the line.  Two years ago, the love of Alexa Kenner's life, government agent Cole Rapaport, was killed in an explosion.  Since then she has been trapped in a sinister plot by a dangerous man, forced to cooperate to save her parents' lives.  There is no one she can turn to.  Then a familiar stranger arrives at Alexa's mountain inn.  He reminds her of Cole and makes her feel the way only he could.  Does she dare hope this stranger is the one man she knows she can trust?<br />That's not really much of a question.  Johnston tells us from the very beginning who the stranger is and the title is a dead giveaway.  What matters is that Johnston takes this well-used plot hook and delivers a wonderful tale of romantic suspense. <br />\\"Operation Reunited\\" is a clear improvement over the author's previous Intrigues, the plodding and predictable \\"Alias Mommy\\" and the mediocre \\"Marriage: Classified.\\"  First and foremost, this is Johnston's first Intrigue to have an actual romance, one with all the passion and emotion the genre demands.  While the characters in \\"Alias Mommy\\" had no chemistry and behaved like brother and sister and the leads in \\"Marriage Classified\\" were so underdeveloped that it was hard to care about their romance, the characters in \\"Operation Reunited\\" are placed in the kind of highly dramatic situation that is made for an emotional romance.  That is exactly why this plot device has been done so often.  Few that I have read have managed to do it this well.  <br />The hero and heroine's relationship is passionate and has the feel of a couple who are meant to be together.  This adds to the suspense.  They can't show their feelings for each other because it would put their lives in danger.  They also can't deny the attraction between them.  Johnston uses this to add a high level of tension to her tale.  Alexa is faced with a terrifying dilemma,the stakes are high and the villains are truly evil.  I love this kind of story, where the characters are faced with insurmountable odds so the reader is really wondering how they will get out of it.  That is suspense.  <br />The story takes a number of unexpected twists toward the end that caught this reader off guard since, after reading enough Intrigues, you tend to believe things are going to happen a certain way.  Instead Johnston keeps her story gripping to the finish.  Alexa is a strong heroine.  Although the hero's distrust toward the heroine grows tedious, it does have a worthy payoff.  Frustrated readers should keep going.  The destination is worth it.  <br />The only thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars is a small one.  I simply found the basis for the intrigue to be too far-fetched.  Even after we've experienced terrorist attacks on American soil, the plot in \\"Operation: Reunited\\" is so big and elaborate and over the top in its intentions and execution that I couldn't make myself buy into it.  The story is effective when it sticks to Alexa, \\"John\\" and their personal dilemma, but less when it gets into the conspiracy at the heart of the suspense plot.  Other readers may not have this problem.<br />\\"Operation: Reunited\\" is an excellent Intrigue, with pulse-pounding romance and suspense in equal doses.  This gripping read will pull you in and not let go until the last page is turned.	2002-03-21
US	50735506	R22VNRIW97EQZG	037322642X	500470612	Secret Agent Heiress (Montana Confidential)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Secret Agent Heiress	The Montana Confidential series concludes with \\"Secret Agent Heiress\\" by Julie Miller.  This is a solid, if underwhelming, end to the series.<br />The book picks up right where the last one, \\"Licensed to Marry,\\" left off (this series should be read in order).  Political heiress Whitney MacNair, who was sent to the Montana Confidential agency after a scandal drove her out of Washington D.C., has been kidnapped by the terrorist the Confidential agency has been after from the start.  Agent Vincent Romeo is sent in to rescue her.  He doesn't expect to like the scandalous heiress, let alone fall for her.  Can he keep his heart in check to save the woman he loves?<br />One aspect the Montana Confidential authors have succeeded at is in the characterization of Whitney.  She has appeared in all the books and has been developed consistently throughout them.  Readers who've read the earlier books will feel like they already know her.  I had mixed feelings about her.  On the one hand she is determined and resourceful.  She's not the kind of heroine who sits around and waits to be rescued.  On the other, her actions are often foolish and several times I was disgusted by her lack of common sense.  She's the type of woman who won't stop talking when she's hiding from the bad guys a few feet away because she wants to keep bickering with the hero.  I liked that she always wanted to go out and do something.  I didn't like that her actions were seldom thought out before went through with them.  She's likable, though frustrating.  Unfortunately, Vincent's character seems sketchy next to her, and I never felt like I got to know him.  A man of few words, he was just this dark silent person lurking in the background.  The villains exhibited more personality than the hero, which diminished the romance somewhat.  <br />In spite of my doubts toward the characters, \\"Secret Agent Heiress\\" is a strong story.  Miller's tale is well-paced and unpredictable.  There are several instances where I thought I knew where it was going, where most books would go.  Miller keeps things interesting by shifting her plot at several points and sending it in a different direction.  For instance, many authors would be happy to have their characters do nothing but run for the length of the story.  Miller doesn't do that.  There's more to \\"Secret Agent Heiress\\" than that, which should keep readers engaged and interested to see what will happen next.  <br />One disappointment readers of all the Texas and Montana Confidential books might have is that Daniel Austin, the only character to carry through all the books, is deprived of his own story.  The way his storyline is wrapped up here is dissatisfying, though that likely is not entirely this author's fault. <br />Overall, the Montana Confidential series was nowhere near as good as the Texas Confidential series.  Let's hope next year's Chicago Confidential series doesn't continue the trend.  With \\"Secret Agent Heiress,\\" it at least ends something of a high note.	2002-03-09

Full of dark suspense and strong romance, this is one of the very best Intrigues in some time.<br />Thea Sarazin's best friend has been swept up in a whirlwind courtship with a mysterious millionaire.  Now Thea is attending the wedding at the groom's isolated caste in the Rocky Mountains.  She doesn't expect to find her own ex-fiance in attendance.  Thea doesn't have time to recover from the shock when the wedding party finds themselves trapped in the castle, cut off from the rest of the world with no way of getting help.  A madman wants revenge on all of them for a secret he claims they all have in common.  Unless they confess, he will kill them.  Can Thea and Spence work together to figure out the secret that links them all before a murderer takes his final revenge?<br />\\"Wedding Captives\\" is a superb Intrigue, combining a good romance, an emotional conflict, a devious villain, a puzzling mystery and the kind of dark, mysterious setting that sucks the reader in and won't let go.  The story is not a new one.  Regular readers may remember Jean Barrett executing the same plot in Intrigue 351, \\"White Wedding\\" : the isolated wedding party in a winter setting, the maid of honor, her former love, the killer coming after them all, even the same red herring, executed no better here than before.  In \\"White Wedding\\" it was too obvious.  In \\"Wedding Captives,\\" it is too pointless.  This is still the better book.<br />\\"Wedding Captives\\" is clever and very smart, a perfect blend of character-based romance and a mystery full of twists and turns.  The reasons for Thea and Spence's breakup aren't based on some stupid misunderstanding.  They had serious differences of opinion that kept them apart.  Now they are different people and it is interesting to see them grow and overcome their past.  The suspense is strong.  Not only is there a constant sense of danger on every page, this is the kind of book that will appeal to readers who enjoy a story they can try to figure out with the characters.  Miles drops clues and lets the reader play along with the mystery.  I love it when it is clear an author has put a great deal of thought into her story.  Miles has obviously put a lot of effort into plotting and working out every aspect of this tale.  I started out having serious doubts about the plausibility of the premise, and the author had her characters address them one by one, such as how a castle accessible only by ski gondola was built on such an isolate mountain to begin with.  Her attention to detail is incredible and gives the story a realistic, present-day grounding that makes even this outlandish premise seem like it could really happen today.  For instance, Thea and her friend are both teachers, and at one point Thea notes how difficult fit is to be a schoolteacher in Colorado post-Columbine.  Details like that make Thea and Spence fully rounded characters, make them that much easier to care about and make the story seem more real.  <br />\\"Wedding Captives\\" is the second book in Miles's Colorado Search and Rescue series, though it stands on its own.  It's so much better than book one, \\"State of Emergency\\" that readers might as well start here.  This book has everything I read Intrigue for and everything I've missed for so long.  If you're looking for the very best in romantic suspense, including tension-filled suspense, puzzling romance, passion and emotion, this is the book for you.  I have no doubt that it will turn out to be one of the best Intrigues of the year.	2002-02-22
US	50735506	R1GELHGZO1HR2V	0373226500	709234890	Secret Sanctuary	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Secret Sanctuary	Harlequin Intrigue returns to its roots in \\"Secret Sanctuary,\\" an interesting, though uneven, modern gothic by Amanda Stevens.  Moriah's Landing, Massachusetts has a dark and mysterious history reaching back to when witches were burned at the stake in the 1600s.  Twenty years ago a serial killer swept through the town and was never caught.  When Professor Elizabeth Douglas discovers the body of a young woman drained of blood, it appears to be starting again.  Bodies begin to pile up and Elizabeth offers her help to police detective Cullen Ryan. Can this man she's always desired protect her when the killer comes after her?<br /><br />For this reader and hopefully many others, \\"Secret Sanctuary\\" marks the beginning of a return to the kind of story Intrigue used to tell before the line became devoted to baby, cop and cowboy stories, when there was a real feeling of danger on every page and the stories were genuinely scary and suspenseful. It is reminiscent of Elise Title's Thornhill stories, also a New England college town with paranormal happenings, and the dark suspense of Jenna Ryan, Elaine K. Stirling and Bethany Campbell.  Amanda Stevens has given many of her books a darker, almost gothic feel, so she seems like a good choice to begin this series.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Secret Sanctuary\\" is a book I wanted to like more than I did.  I was thrilled to see Intrigue embracing so many paranormal and gothic elements again.  But there are way too many of them.  Witches, curses, ghosts, serial killers, mysterious recluses, isolated castles on cliffs, cults, secret societies, mad scientists.  It's not a modern gothic.  It's gothic stew.  Somewhere along the line \\"Secret Sanctuary\\" lost all fictional believability for me and became a too obvious mishmash of all the weird themes Stevens (or since this is a multi-author series, the authors and their editor) could jam into one book.  It stopped being suspenseful and started being silly.  I could buy a town with a few extraordinary happenings but all this happening in one town?  Eventually I had to roll my eyes and give up on even trying to believe a town like this could exist.  It's interesting to note that, despite all the gimmicks, \\"Secret Sanctuary\\" is neither as gothic, atmospheric or suspenseful as another of this month's Intrigues, \\"Wedding Captives\\" by Cassie Miles.  In that book, Miles takes one element, the isolated castle, and uses it to good effect.  Here, the gothic overload lessens the effect.<br /><br />\\"Secret Sanctuary\\" also suffers from the problem faced by most first books in a series.  The author has to fit in so much information to set up the series that readers may be overwhelmed with information.  Stevens stuffs huge chunks of information in at a time, not integrating it very well.  The story comes to a stop, or takes a while to get going, because we're too busy being spoonfed information.  The first few chapters are particularly overstuffed, and some readers may find themselves having to go back and reread passages to keep all the characters straight.  With so much going on, the romance is shortchanged.  While Elizabeth is an interesting, well-developed and unique heroine, Cullen is barely developed beyond what we learn about him in the first couple of chapters: former bad boy, now a cop.  That's it.  And the more unique and interesting part of their conflict, that Elizabeth is a genius and Cullen always thought she was a know-it-all, is overshadowed by the more predictable rich-girl/poor-boy conflict we've seen before.<br /><br />Once the story gets going, Stevens delivers her usual pageturner, although the effort to begin the series must not have left her much time to plot her mystery.  The killer is surprisingly obvious for an author who is usually so good at keeping readers guessing.  On a more positive note, the story is certainly never boring.  Stevens pens several suspenseful sequences with Elizabeth in danger that are gripping.  I love how the title isunique, not an attempt to show what hook this story uses (for instance, no mention of a cop hero) and actually has a meaning that is revealed in the story, like a great title should.<br />I do think Stevens did the best she could with a tough assignment.  Since most of these elements are related to the other authors' books, she had no choice but to incorporate them.  It does give me some hope that, with all of this out of the way, the next books will be able to tell their own stories and not fill every page with as much gothic weirdness as possible.<br /><br />\\"Secret Sanctuary\\" isn't a great book.  It is a fun and entertaining one that should leave readers waiting to see what happens next in Moriah's Landing.	2002-02-22

Melinda's long-lost brother recently came into possession of an old notebook belonging to their secret agent parents and sent a copy to Melinda.  Clay's mission is to get the notebook and decode it.  But when he finds Melinda, she's under attack and drowning.  He saves her, only to discover she has amnesia.  Can he unlock the location of the notebook from her mind and protect her from the men who are also after it?<br /><br />Kearney has gained fans for writing fast-paced stories that keep readers turning pages.  They are easy reads that go down quickly.  Like most of her books, \\"Lovers in Hiding\\" goes by fast, fast, fast.  If all you're looking for is a fast read that you'll forget as soon as it's over, \\"Lovers in Hiding\\" is an acceptable choice.  If you're looking for something more, like characters, believable plots or any plot whatsoever,  \\"Lovers in Hiding\\" would not be a good choice.  There is simply nothing to this book other than the fast pace.  There's no mystery to solve because the villain's identity is so obvious from the start.  There's no plot to follow.  The hero and heroine meet, they run and run and run (and run and run and run and run) and they live happily ever after.  The end.  There's not much of a love story.  The book takes place over a very short period of time and the characters are always running, so they have to fall in love almost instantly.  This is the kind of story where characters who just met are hot and heavy for each other within a half an hour.  I believed Clay and Melinda were in lust.  I did not believe they were in love.  There are no characters.  Kearney gives a few basic facts about Clay and Melinda but never gives them any dimension or development.  The reader never gets to know the characters.  It is impossible to believe they got to know each other.  Good Intrigues are able to provide a strong relationship, emotional romance, well developed characters and an interesting plot.  \\"Lovers in Hiding\\" has none of these.  I've been able to recommend Intrigues with weak romances if the mystery is that spectacular, or weak intrigue because of a stunning love story.  \\"Lovers in Hiding\\" doesn't provide either.<br /><br />\\"Lovers in Hiding\\" is also contrived and not very well thought out.  The author changes the rules of Melinda's \\"amnesia\\" from page to page, shifting what she remembers and doesn't remember until it's impossible to believe she has amnesia.  Her \\"amnesia\\" lasts for about two seconds and a couple of pages before she starts to remember.  One minute she doesn't know anything, the next she's spouting off all of these details about her life, the next she's still claiming she has amnesia.  Melinda conveniently remembers everything about her life when she needs it and conveniently can't remember anything that would make the story end sooner, like where the journal is.  It doesn't make any sense.  She remembers nothing.  She remembers everything.  No, almost everything.  Then she remembers more.  But she still can't remember one little thing....  And this is all within the first few chapters.  This seems like an obvious attempt by the author, who knows that amnesia books sell well, to get fans of amnesia books to buy this one without her having to write an amnesia book, much the way she did the secret baby plot in \\"Cradle Will Rock\\" while having her characters ignore how real people would react to the discovery of a secret child.  Kearney's treatment of the CIA is also amateurish and unconvincing.  While authors like Gayle Wilson have written dramatic, believable stories about intrigue in the CIA, Kearney's version is lightweight, as realistic as a bunch of kids playing cops and robbers. On a more positive, the ending is typically exciting.  Kearney's books are never boring and the climax and epilogue of \\"Lovers in Hiding\\" are verynice.<br /><br />Kearney's fans will likely know what to expect from her and enjoy this one as well.  Her stories move so fast some readers may not have time to think about the story any more than the author did.  While I've enjoyed some of her books (\\"A Night Without End,\\" \\"Little Boys Blue\\"), this is not one of them.  It doesn't approach her worst (\\"Deceiving Daddy,\\" \\"Priority Male,\\" \\"Lullaby and Goodnight\\").  That doesn't make it good either.	2002-02-09

A surrogate mother, Megan agreed to carry her best friend's baby before the parents were killed. Now Megan is struggling to decide what to do with the baby when Bart Cromwell arrives in her life. Bart is secretly trying to protect Megan from a danger she doesn't know she faces. Can he also help her make a family with her baby?<br /><br />\\"Another Woman's Baby\\" is a well-written story with an emphasis on the relationship between Bart and Megan. It is slowly paced with good development and scenes that help us to see how they fall in love. Though the book does take place within a few weeks, this is a nice change from most Intrigues, where the characters are on the run and fall in love in a few days. Because the characters are in one place, they have the opportunity to learn about one another.  Bart is a protective and kind hero. Megan is strong and determined.  Readers who enjoy the kind of love story where the characters spend a lot of time together and get to know each other will enjoy this one. Readers who enjoy strong suspense in their stories may be disappointed, because the romance is the strength of \\"Another Woman's Baby,\\" not the suspense.<br /><br />I found the suspense portion of to be too obvious and boring. I suspect many mystery readers and diehard Intrigue readers will find the same. Within a few chapters, I immediately guessed everything that was ultimately revealed about Megan, the birth mother and why someone was after her. There's really only one solution to the mystery that will ensure not only a happy ending, but an ending that will wrap everything up so neatly and place a bright red bow on top. This makes it far too easy to guess the big surprises in the end and may leave some readers bored or frustrated waiting for the characters to come to conclusions they already have.  If Wayne had made it seem like any other solution was possible it would have made the story more suspenseful. It also would have added to the emotional drama. Issues are tied up so neatly the characters don't have to make any tough choices. They're all made for them. Also, while the slower pace adds to the romance, it lessens the suspense. The villain's threats are spread out over so much time that I wondered why this person didn't seem in any hurry to get rid of Megan if that was really the goal. Though Wayne's setting and tone is atmospheric, the suspense plot was too obvious for me.<br /><br />Had the ending been more of a surprise, I would have enjoyed the story more. Instead, it became a too-predictable waiting game and I was bored. Romance readers should enjoy \\"Another Woman's Baby\\" more than mystery readers.	2002-02-09

Peterson keeps the story flowing and has a way with the unexpected.  Although the hero is hard-headed and the main couple seem to repeat the same arguments about their past over and over without making any progress, the action and suspense are strong.

She claims she was kidnapped, held prisoner and artificially inseminated with his child.  Jake doesn't believe such a crazy tale. Then it becomes clear that someone is trying to kill her and Jessie knows things she can't possibly know.  Though he doesn't trust her he has to keep her close until he discovers if she's being used to destroy him.  Could this stranger be carrying his child?<br />&quot;His Child&quot; has the kind of storyline that is very hard to believe.  Many people will probably read the first two sentences of that summary, think it's stupid and pass on this book.  What makes it stand out and makes it such an entertaining read is the writing.  Fossen is a talented author and the story flies by.  The pace is incredibly fast and the twists never stop.  This is a real pageturner.  I was having such a fun time reading it that I was able to get past how far-fetched it was.  The mystery is strong with a number of suspects to keep the reader guessing.  The characters are dynamic and the situation they find themselves in is naturally dramatic, providing the story with a strong conflict and highly emotional scenes.  Although one Big Misunderstanding threatens to derail the story, Fossen manages to create enough empathy for her characters that I wasn't alienated.  I cared enough about the characters to want to see them overcome it.  <br />&quot;His Child&quot; is a book I read in one sitting.  Despite its convoluted premise, it has all the emotion, mystery and suspense of a great Intrigue.  The biggest compliment I can give this book is that it contains most of the elements I'm tired of, and I still liked the book.  One of the most sheerly entertaining Intrigues I've read in a while.	2002-01-12

Daniels delivers a Christmas Intrigue in \\"A Woman With a Mystery,\\" an entertaining, though flawed, romantic suspense.  A year ago a mystery woman walked into Slade Rawlins's life, became his lover, then disappeared.  Now she's back.  Except Holly Barrows doesn't seem to remember him.  She wants to hire him to find out what happened to her baby, a baby Slade knows must be his.  The doctors claim the baby is dead.  Holly says it was kidnapped by \\"monsters.\\"  Can Slade believe her and find his child?<br /><br />\\"A Woman With a Mystery\\" is a compelling pageturner, though Daniels regular readers may find it far too similar to her other books.  It's interesting that out of the 12 Intrigues she's written, 8 (8!) of them have involved a secret child or baby being passed off as someone else's as part of the plot.  That's two thirds of them.  It's not surprising that this book starts to feel old from the start.  I had the entire story figured out far too early, mainly because the author has taken me down this same road too many times before.  I have the feeling she could have come up with this story in her sleep.  Like most of her books, it's overly convoluted and stretches credibility in ways that makes it hard to believe several plot points.  That isn't to say it isn't well written.  Daniels's prose is typically engaging and fast-paced.  Despite the predictability of the plot, I was never bored or anxious to put it down.  I was never completely engaged either.<br /><br />Part of this has to do with another element of the book.  Daniels makes it hard to completely empathize with her heroine because so little of the book is told from her perspective.  The book is 250 pages long, and no more than twenty-five of those are in the heroine's point of view.  This makes it really hard to get into her head and know what she's feeling.  She never really came to life for me.  The book is hero-driven and we do get to know Slade and his motivations very well.  Readers who enjoy goodheroes might like this one.  But Holly is mainly a victim who gets shuffled from one event to the next, and the lack of insight into her head only makes her seem more passive.<br /><br />\\"A Woman With a Mystery\\" is a pleasant way to spend a few hours.  I suspect though the author's talent would be better served with a more original storyline.  Something without a secret parentage?  Her upcoming entry in the Trueblood Texas series doesn't sound promising.  Hopefully her upcoming gothic in the Moriah's Landing series will be.	2001-12-26

Sullivan's detective agency was investigating her sister.  Now both the investigator and Bailey's sister are missing.  Can Bailey work with Sullivan to find out what happened, and uncover the secrets that kept them apart?<br /><br />Allen's Intrigues tend to be thoroughly different and imaginative.  \\"Sullivan's Last Stand\\" is no exception, an interesting puzzle told in her distinctive voice.  I don't think I've ever read a mystery quite like this in romantic suspense, full of unexpected twists and shifts in direction.  As always, readers looking for a breath of fresh air in the often stagnant world of romantic suspense will find it here.  Her heroine is strong and fiery, her hero full of dark charm, and their story culminates in another spectacular, emotional and unforgettable climax.  This is the perfect companion to the wonderful first Avengers book, \\"Guarding Jane Doe,\\" not letting down readers in the least.  Probably the best one-two punch since the first two books in Gayle Wilson's Men of Mystery series.  Don't miss it!	2001-12-26
US	50735506	RK9VWG56FQP0G	0373834721	5961341	Bronze Mystique / Secrets in Silence	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Bronze Mystique & Secrets in Silence	Harlequin's latest 2-in-1 collection is a combination of a 1984 Harlequin Temptation, \\"Bronze Mystique,\\" by Barbara Delinsky and a new Harlequin Intrigue by Gayle Wilson, \\"Secrets in Silence.\\"  I'm always skeptical of these collections.  They usually exploit the better selling author, in this case Delinsky, by reprinting one of her older books that is dated and nothing like the books she's writing now, while drawing attention to the newer author who might not get it otherwise.  Since the newer author's book is more contemporary and suited to today's readers, it comes off better than the reprint and makes the old favorite look weaker. That was the case in the last one of these 2-in-1 Intrigue collections, with Delinsky's \\"Threats and Promises\\" and the then-new \\"Her Secret Past\\" by Amanda Stevens.  The difference is more noticeable here since \\"Bronze Mystique\\" was not even an Intrigue.  Why not reprint an actual Intrigue in an Intrigue collection?  Nora Roberts's \\"Night Moves\\" seems a perfect fit with this book.  Anne Stuart's \\"Catspaw\\" fits even better, with her Wilson collaboration on a new \\"Catspaw\\" sequel coming out next month.  Wilson's book is so good only something like those books would have been able to withstand direct comparison in a collection like this.    I found the book inexplicably chosen instead, Delinsky's \\"Bronze Mystique,\\" to be a solid read.  Anyone reading it in 1984 might like it even more.  But the series romance novels of 1984 were very different than most of what we see today and I don't think it's fair to completely judge it in today's terms.  Readers may want to keep in mind that the book is seventeen years old and does read like it.  Those more familiar with Delinsky's current work and bestsellers will find something far different here.  The romance is good, though the story is very slowly paced and the subplot takes a while to develop.  Ironically, that would normally make it a perfect companion for a Wilson story.    Wilson's \\"Secrets in Silence,\\" though, is nearly worth the price of the collection by itself.  I've had a wide range of responses to this author's Intrigues over the years.  One thing has remained the same for all of them:  I've never understood why her books were Intrigues and not Intimate Moments.  None of her Intrigues have been plot heavy or mystery oriented whodunits, the two elements that typically separate Intrigues from Intimate Moments.  I've never been able to tell the difference between her brand of romantic suspense and the Intimate Moments version.      \\"Secrets in Silence\\" is a first.  For me, it's the first Wilson contemporary that is unmistakably an Intrigue and doesn't feel like it could be an Intimate Moments.  Most of her books to feature a whodunit (\\"Echoes in the Dark,\\" the Home to Texas books, \\"Her Private Bodyguard,\\" \\"Never Let Her Go,\\" \\"Heart of the Night\\") failed as mysteries because there were too few suspects and so few developed secondary characters that it was too obvious who the villain had to be (like most Intimate Moments).  \\"Secrets in Silence\\" is the first to feature a large cast of characters and a number of suspects to keep readers guessing to the end.  It's the first Wilson Intrigue to feature a heavily plotted, intricate mystery that's as important as, if not more than, the romance.  This has to be the best contemporary murder mystery Wilson has ever written.  So of course, it's not being published as an Intrigue.  What irony.    The story: Ten years after a little girl was murdered in a small Alabama town, Callie Evers has come to investigate.  She found a connection that links this case to the murder of another little girl.  No one seems willing to discuss the murder that tore the town apart, especially not former police chief Ben Stanton.  Stanton was torn apart for bungling the case and failing to charge the killer.  Now he may have a second chance.  Callie has become a target of someone who doesn't like the questions she's asking.  Can Stanton finally close the case that's haunted him all these years and save one more victim from a deadly killer?    If \\"Bronze Mystique\\" was dated in a bad way, \\"Secrets in Silence\\" reminds me of old Intrigues in a good way.  It's a throwback to the kinds of books the line used to publish.  Dark, atmospheric, full of small town secrets, it's the kind of story I've missed.  Some category readers may want to be warned that this story contains some mainstream elements not everyone will be comfortable with.  The murder of children is not an easy topic to read about, and I found some parts of the story unsettling (and rightfully so).  This may not be a story for everyone.  Those that do try it will likely find a wonderfully engrossing and suspenseful tale you won't want to read in the dark.  It's one of the best Intrigues of the year.    Normally, I wouldn't recommend paying a higher price for a category-sized novel and a reprint.  In this case, \\"Secrets in Silence\\" is worth the price all on its own.  One of the very best by the author.	2001-11-12
US	50735506	RLD051LNANLV0	0373226373	438877365	Night And Day	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Night and Day	Two celebrated authors combine for two \\"editorially connected stories,\\" as the ads say (because just saying \\"connected stories\\" would confuse people???) in \\"Night and Day.\\"  Anne Stuart offers the latest sequel in her classic Catspaw series, while Gayle Wilson brings her latest Man of Mystery.  The result is a highly entertaining romp through a world of spine-tingling danger and romance.<br /><br />There's some irony in the title.  Although Stuart is known for her \\"dark\\" heroes, she's no stranger to more light-hearted capers, while Wilson's tales are unerringly dark and humorless.  In this collection, Wilson's \\"Day\\" is substantially darker than Stuart's \\"Night,\\" something that shouldn't surprise readers of their Harlequins.  In Stuart's tale, cat burglar Michael Blackheart decides to make his final heist by stealing a priceless collection protected by the father he never knew.  He doesn't expect to meet Isabel Linden, a woman he would risk everything for, or to find himself facing a deadly conspiracy.  In \\"Day,\\" Duncan Cullhane agrees to help Andrea Sorrensen recover the music box her grandmother lost in World War II.  Duncan has always loved Andrea, his best friend's widow.  Can he protect her when the search leads them to a deadly plot that threatens the world?<br /><br />I must admit to dreading \\"Night,\\" despite my love for \\"Catspaw\\" and \\"Catspaw II.\\"  The idea of Blackheart and his Francesca (Ferris to everyone else) being pushed into middle age to accommodate a new, younger generation held little appeal.  I should have had more faith in the author.  Stuart dodges the issue by producing an illegitimate son Blackheart never knew he had in Michael, who's been unwittingly following in his old man's footsteps.  \\"Night\\" seems to take place in \\"real time,\\" about thirteen years after \\"Catspaw II,\\" appropriate since that book came out 13 years ago, keeping the couple from the earlier books in their prime of life.  Ferris and the elder Blackheart are as delightful as ever, their chemistry is still potent on the few pages they appear, and I have to admit my favorite parts of the story were theirs.  Some readers may have difficulty believing Michael and Isabel are able to fall in love for keeps in one night when they don't spend that much time together.  However, the story is still loads of fun, packed with steamy romance, plenty of action and truly evil villains to keep you desperately turning the pages.  This is one of the more purely \\"fun\\" stories Stuart has written, with one of her patented bad boy heroes.  Readers will likely enjoy reading this short novella so much that any concerns about whether this love will last will pale compared to how entertaining the story is.<br /><br />Fans of Ms. Wilson should find that \\"Day\\" delivers what they've come to expect from her.  Strong romance, a somewhat slow start, and a stunning finale in a world made plausibly real.  \\"Day\\" actually takes place over several days, allowing Wilson to develop more of a full love story than Stuart could.  It's also interesting to note that \\"Day\\" has as much plot as most of Wilson's Intrigues, but the shorter length prevents her from dragging out her story (meaning the endless narration and introspection her characters usually indulge in has been cut), resulting in a faster, more relentless pace.  The 140 or so pages will fly by.  Her heroine is also wonderful, strong and couragous, though some may find her hero overly familiar.  Wilson seems to enjoy maiming her heroes more than any villain does, and Duncan with his prosthetic hand is yet another of her blinded, scarred, and other physically battered heroes tormented by the past.  However, this story also features one of her trademark explosive finales that will leave readers gasping for air and simply stunned in the end and the love story is genuinely moving.<br /><br />Both stories are good.  Together, they're great, complementing each other perfect in an ingenious and original plot unlike any you'll findin most romantic suspense novels.  This is one of the fastest reads I've had this year.  I finished it in one nonstop setting, unable to put either story down.  It's a good thing there was that brief break between them so I could catch my breath.

Montana Confidential Agent Kyle Foster gives her the chance.  Someone in her father's lab is connected to the terrorists; Kyle wants to go undercover inside to find the mole.  The only way to do this is for them to be married.  Neither Laura nor single father Kyle is looking for love.  What will they do when they find it?<br />\\"Licensed to Marry\\" is a light little story that will entertain, though some nagging nits keep it from reaching its full potential.  The characters are likable, the story all too real and the writing smooth enough to keep the reader quickly turning the pages.  Some readers may find this story, with its plot revolving around bombings and anthrax threats, too close to recent events for comfort.  For some, it will be hard to find this entertaining when we've seen the reality.  However, I was surprised to find myself less bothered by this than by the characters' willingness to enter into a marriage with so little consideration to how it will affect Kyle's daughter.  She's already lost one mother.  Giving her another one they have no reason to believe will stick around after the case is closed seems cruel and the way they dismiss the issue by saying the child is \\"resilient\\" is utterly heartless.  The child's heartbreaking reaction to the announcement that they've married without telling her only punctuates the hero and heroine's thoughtlessness.  It's a shame because otherwise, the characters are likable.  The fact that they could treat a child like this made it difficult to completely respect them.<br />This is still the best of the Montana Confidential so far, which may be faint praise but it still true.  Douglas provides the best plot, the most exciting action and the strongest characters so far.  If only her characters were morethoughtful about some very relevant issues.	2001-11-12

He doesn't expect to find an old love there.  Sabrina is someone he loved and left behind.  Now she's trying to keep her brother from falling under the militia's influence while guarding a precious secret from Court.  Will he discover what it is?<br /><br />Debra Webb's writing is excellent as always, but it's not enough to save a fundamentally boring story.  \\"Special Assignment: Baby\\" is as predictable as Intrigue gets.  This is a story that hits all the expected notes and offers few, if any surprises.  Primarily a romance with a little (very little) suspense, it is hard to tell how this book is romantic suspense and not a regular long contemporary.  There is neither much danger or suspense for most of this book nor any mystery.  It's hard to understand why books like Suzanne Brockmann's, which contain more action than this, are considered long contemporaries around RITA time while this is considered romantic suspense.  Compared with the nonstop action of Ms. Webb's previous Intrigues, this was a bore.<br /><br />\\"Special Assignment: Baby\\" also suffers from a weak and stupid heroine.  You would think that any intelligent person would question an FBI agent suddenly signing up with a militia group.  Wouldn't she at least wonder if he's undercover?  Of course Sabrina's too dim to think of that.  Worse, the heroine is completely separated from the intrigue element.  Unlike most Intrigues, which involves the heroine in the Intrigue at its premise, most of this book moves between Court dealing with the intrigue and Court romancing Sabrina.  Sabrina never knows what's going on and for most of the book never seems to be in any danger.  Most of her scenes are dull and drag badly.<br /><br />\\"Special Assignment: Baby\\" also has something in common with Webb's previous secret child Intrigue, \\"The Bodyguard's Baby.\\" This is a book where the story ends but the book does not.  It continues past its natural ending.  The plot has a good climax that signals the story should be coming to an end.  It doesn't.  Webb stretches it out with another two chapters with filler that does nothing to advance this story and, after a long while, sets up the next book.  Finishing this book became a chore.<br />Webb's voice is too strong and her writing too polished for this to be a bad book.  Had this been an Intimate Moments or Superromance I may not have had as much of a problem with it.  But \\"breathtaking romantic suspense\\" this was not.  Romantic, yes.  Breathtaking or suspenseful, no.	2001-10-26

Haunted by psychic visions she cannot stop, Beth Wagner has been hiding from the world in her remote farmhouse.  Her latest vision shows her the murder of an old high school friend, and brings Detective Cal Rollins into her life.  The skeptical cop doesn't believe her but soon comes to realize how much danger she's in.  The only way to protect her (supposedly) is to pretend to be engaged so that he can move into her farmhouse without raising too many questions.  But how can he save her from the visions that have lured a killer and placed her in more danger than ever?<br />Though it's been forever since Intrigue has published a story like this or even a paranormal romance, some romantic suspense readers may find this premise to be a familiar one.  Fortunately, the execution is what matters here.  Glick has enough tricks up her sleeve and powerful moments to make her story unique and memorable.  What initially seems tiresome and trite (poor tormented female psychic, mean cop who thinks she's a nut and doesn't believe her, the high school revenge killer, the pretend engagement) soon reveals itself to be something more.  So many books simply skim the surface of their hooks and premise and offer the predictable (ironically, the first book in this trilogy, \\"The Man From Texas\\" was one of them).  \\"Never Alone\\" is the rare exception, a story that uses the familiar hooks as a starting point and develops beyond them.  In \\"Never Alone,\\" the author keeps pushing the story into the unexpected, especially in regard to the paranormal elements, creating a story that is consistently surprising and often startlingly moving.  Glick takes full advantage of the opportunities paranormal romances offer to bring readers a powerful and unforgettable love story.<br />So much of what makes the story enjoyable is how unexpected much of it is, so I won't mention any more of the plot.  What can be said is that the characters are strong and sympathetic.  These kinds of fragile psychic heroines can often come across as weak.  Beth never does.  Glick provides her with a core of strength and basic decency that makes her easy to root for.  It's interesting that I found Beth stronger and more heroic than the heroine of \\"The Man From Texas,\\" who was a cop, perhaps because that heroine's angst was inexplicable.  Beth's torment is presented vividly, making it easy for the reader to see what she is going through and to empathize.  Although Cal's initial disbelief is frustrating (Just once could we have a book where the cop believes the psychic and doesn't call her crazy, or at least is willing to keep an open mind?), he should please readers looking for a rugged, masculine hero.  I did have some reservations with how quickly they fell in love, but the end result is so powerful that it's easy to overlook.  Anyone who finds themselves resisting the swiftness of the romance, rest assured, it's for a reason and certainly worth it.  Go with it.<br />It is somewhat unfortunate that this book is being published now, since one of last month's Intrigues contained a scene startlingly similar to the centerpiece moment here.  However, I think both books are strong enough to stand the comparison.  Densely plotted and packed with story,  \\"Never Alone\\" should have everything a reader wants:  strong emotion, unforgettable scenes, good atmosphere and suspense.  I should also mention that this is the second book in the Light Street trilogy \\"Mine to Keep\\" and advances the story started in \\"The Man From Texas.\\"  However, the other book doesn't need to be read first to read this one.  \\"Never Alone\\" is so much better than \\"The Man From Texas,\\" why not start with it?  A superlative work, \\"Never Alone\\" deserves to stand with the best of the Light Street books.	2001-10-26

When he receives word that a woman is using her name and identification, he immediately tracks her down.  Luke is determined to find out if the woman calling herself Mary Calder is connected to his wife's death.  He doesn't expect the attraction he feels for her.  But is he attracted to this woman, or to her resemblance to his wife?<br />The best word I can come up with to describe \\"In His Wife's Name\\" is \\"pleasant.\\"  This is a sweet story about nice people.  It's not particularly suspenseful, and the tension is rather low, but the characters are likable and the story moves smoothly.  I may not have been on the edge of my seat, but I was never bored.  The story is somewhat slow in the beginning.  Part of the mystery is diluted because we know the truth about \\"Mary\\" and who she is from page one.  Much of the book is spent watching Luke figure it out.  The real mystery surrounding threats against \\"Mary\\" and the truth about Luke's wife's death, doesn't  really kick in until a good ways into the story.  Until then, everything she goes through seems more like silly pranks than anything truly menacing.  This contributes to the \\"lighter\\" feel of the suspense.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though I'm sure I'm making it sound like it.  It's good from a character standpoint, less so for the suspense.  It offers a chance for the reader to get to know the characters well. As always, Sullivan's characters are warm and sympathetic, generating strong rooting interest.  It just takes some time before the threats against them feel too urgent, despite the fears the heroine expresses.  Meanwhile, Sullivan does a good job using the villain's point of view to tease the reader with information, leading to a particularly strong climax and resolution.  The romance is sweet and engaging.<br />Many readers will find this approach appealing.  Like \\"The Mysterious Twin\\" two months ago, this is a good story for those who like their romantic suspense a little lighter, without too much hard violence, and this book has a better ending.  \\"In His Wife's Name\\" is a good read.	2001-10-10

This is a sequel to last year's Texas Confidential series.  In \\"Someone to Protect Her,\\" former military pilot Frank Connolly is assigned to escort a British scientist to a Montana research facility.  But when their flight is sabotaged, the pair is stranded in the Montana wilderness.  On the run from the mercenary hired to kidnap her, C.J. Birch must trust that Frank will keep her safe.  Can she also unlock the demons haunting this rugged man?<br />So far, Montana Confidential is looking less like a sequel to Texas Confidential than a copy, so much so that I almost feel I should cut and paste my review of the first TC book, \\"The Bodyguard's Assignment,\\" here.  Both series start out with a reliable mystery writer being forced to write a couple-on-the-run Intrigue, both involving a bodyguard with a haunted past assigned to transport a woman in danger. \\"Someone to Protect Her\\" and \\"The Bodyguard's Assignment\\" could easily switch titles.   And the second book for each series is a secret baby story.  If the third book turns out to be a fake couple story, I'll really be worried. <br />As with \\"The Bodyguard's Assignment,\\" this book does not show its author at her best.  Like Amanda Stevens last year, Rosemoor is an author who usually delivers intricate plotting and interesting mysteries, and this simply isn't that kind of book.  She gives a half-hearted attempt at some mystery, but overall, there's nothing to this plot.  It's one of those stories that is simply 250 pages of the characters running, bouncing from one dangerous situation to the next while being chased by the most inept mercenary ever.  The story simply isn't that interesting.  It's nothing more than the killer catching them, them getting away, the killer catching them, them getting away, the killer catching them...and surprise!  They get away.  You can probably guess what happensthen.  The formula is dull and repetitive.  I was bored a hundred pages into it and had to struggle to make it to the end.  The twists are few and far between.  As for what mystery there is, it's too easily predicted (honestly--what else could it have turned out to be?).<br />There are also several annoying elements, for instance, the way the C.J. continually refers to Frank as \\"more handsome than George Clooney,\\" a comparison she makes about nine times.  George Clooney.  George Clooney.  George Clooney.  Enough already!   We get it!  He looks like George Clooney, only more handsome.  Got it.  On the plus side, Rosemoor does a much better job setting up this series than Stevens did last year.  The main characters for the other books have been given reasonably well-defined personalities, the agency is well-defined, and we understand who the overall villains and players will be better than in Texas Confidential.  <br />It's nice to have this veteran author back.  Now if only the editors would let her write the mysteries she excels at.  This is Rosemoor's thirty-first Intrigue.  I'd have to say at least twenty-nine of those were better than this one.	2001-10-10

Can they dare to work together to unravel the truth about the daughter she believes they share?<br /><br />Like book two, \\"The Tempted,\\" \\"The Forgiven\\" is an engrossing emotional drama and a true page-turner.  Everything that made that book good is present in \\"The Forgiven.\\"  This book stands with Ms. Stevens's strongest, a story with deep emotion and strong characters.  The premise faced by the main characters is heartbreaking and Stevens fills their story with her usual moving prose.  Naomi and Alex are instantly sympathetic.  \\"The Forgiven\\" is less melodramatic and more emotional than \\"The Tempted,\\" making this story that much more effective.  This is the kind of book that shows you don't need lots of explosions and action scenes to make a fast-paced read.  The story here is mystery and character oriented and flies by.<br /><br />One weakness that's unusual for Ms. Stevens is the mystery.  The intrigue is surprisingly weak for one of her book.  The clues aren't dropped with Ms. Stevens's usual grace, and many readers may figure out the ending long before it comes.  This is partly because there is really only one solution that makes much sense here.  Stevens tries to keep the secret to the end.  This results in scenes where we think the characters will catch on, only to have them jump to clearly wrong solutions instead of the more obvious true one.  It can be very frustrating watching the characters miss the obvious truth time and again before it finally comes out.  However, the romance and character drama are so strong that this flaw is a minor one.<br /><br />Two words of warning:  this book SHOULD NOT be read unless you've read Book Two in the series,\\"The Tempted.\\"  This book flows directly from that one, and the entire plot of \\"The Tempted\\" is summarized in the first few pages of \\"The Forgiven.\\"  It can be read on its own, but you won't be able to go back and read the other one later.  Also, the back cover copywriter does the reader a disservice by once again revealing late developments in the book.<br /><br />\\"The Forgiven\\" is a very nice end to another solid Stevens miniseries.	2001-10-08

It's been a month since Tess Campbell's five-year-old daughter disappeared (in book one \\"The Innocent\\").  The police are ready to give up, the volunteers are going home, but Tess refuses to quit.  Needing money to continue the search, she goes to the only man she can think of, Jared Spencer.  Their relationship ended on bad terms six years ago.  Can she keep the secret of the past from him while trusting him to help her?<br /><br />All the elements for a great Intrigue are here.  A highly emotional story, a good mystery with plenty of possibilities and hissable villains.  Although the plot is undeniably melodramatic, it contributes to the emotional tone, pulling the reader in and keeping them turning the pages at a frantic pace.  Stevens has also covered this ground before, in books like \\"A Man of Secrets\\" and \\"Someone's Baby.\\"  Evil rich people.  Sibling rivalry.  But it works.  Her story is also one where the suspense plot is a perfect match for the romance.  Unlike book one, where it was difficult to believe the characters were falling in love in the middle of those circumstances, \\"The Tempted\\" does what the best Intrigues do, using the suspense plot to pull her characters and heighten the emotions between them.  Both the high stakes and the unresolved feelings in their past make it easy to understand why they would be experiencing these emotions and falling back in love at such a difficult time.  The unrequited love theme and the odds the characters face give the hero and heroine strong rooting interest and will make the reader as involved in their story as they are.<br /><br />Although the heroine makes many questionable choices and too often is just plain irrational, the hero is (fortunately) patient enough to deal with her, at least making them a good match.  Stevens does an exceptional job making us believe these two aremeant to be together.  This is also another very strong mystery.  The surprise ending leads straight into the next book, and will have readers eagerly reaching for their copy of \\"The Forgiven.\\" \\"The Tempted\\" shouldn't be missed.	2001-10-08
US	50735506	R12DFF3CP5LNHJ	0373226284	362211061	Guarding Jane Doe (The Avengers) (Intrigue, 628)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Guarding Jane Doe	Harper Allen kicks off a new miniseries with another amazing read in \\"Guarding Jane Doe.\\"  Soldier-of-fortune Quinn McGuire lived each moment as if it were his last, until he received a letter from a woman who'd once saved his life and Jane Smith walked into his life.  Bound by a promise he'd made years ago, he became Jane's protector.  Someone was after her, leaving threatening notes and endangering her life--and Jane couldn't remember why.  She knew nothing about her past<br /><br />Allen's best book since \\"Twice Tempted,\\" \\"Guarding Jane Doe\\" is an amazingly emotional and action-packed read that combines all the best elements of Intrigue.  In spite of my trepidation to see yet another amnesia plot (the second one this month), this is an author known for thoroughly inventive plotlines, and I wasn't disappointed in this book, another original tale unlike any other.<br /><br />This is the rare book that manages to combine a good mystery with strong sensuality and the kind of deeply romantic scenes that leave readers sighing.  Although Jane initially seems like a disappointingly wimpy heroine, Allen soon reminds us that no one is who they first seem to be in one of her books.  Identities are uncovered, secrets are revealed, and everything we think we know is turned on its head several times over.  Although I had the misfortune to figure out the ending long before it came (more dumb luck than anything on the writer's part), it didn't ruin my enjoyment of the book, because Allen delivered enough action and intensity before the ending came to keep me wondering if I could be so sure what I thought I knew.  Ultimately, I could, but getting there was still a blast.<br /><br />As with all of her Intrigues, Allen shows a remarkable talent for creating memorable scenes, the kind that will stick with you long after the book is over.  There are so many choice moments that make this book unforgettable, both emotional and suspenseful, including a climax that is both.  There especially, the hero and heroine show what incredible people they are.<br />I think it's safe to say this is the best Intrigue I've read this year, and the way this year's been going, I don't expect it to be beat.  Whether your first book by this author or your fifth, \\"Guarding Jane Doe\\" will keep readers anxiously awaiting the arrival of Book Two, \\"Sullivan's Last Stand,\\" next month.	2001-08-22

When Dare Hamilton dies mysteriously, her stalker turns her attention to her twin sister, Desire. Desire is determined to find the truth about her sister's death. Unfortunately Dare's ex-husband Nick intends to do the same. Nick refuses to leave Desire, especially when it becomes clear someone is after her. Can he protect his only Desire?<br /><br />Sorry about that bad pun, but it's no worse than the ones seen throughout this book. It's hard to take seriously any book where the heroine is given such a ridiculous name, and Lee makes sure we can't by making a joke out of it repeatedly. Hearing the variations on the phrase \\"his only Desire\\" used by both the hero and the villain, I couldn't stop snickering throughout the story. What a bad idea.<br /><br />However, the most questionable part of this story is the \\"hero,\\" an LAPD cop with a dubious service record.  Knowing that he has been suspended without knowing why casts an uncomfortable shadow on his character for too much of the book, when it's not strong to begin with. I had a real problem with a \\"hero\\" who marries one sister, then falls in love with her \\"twin\\" the very next day. What's heroic about that? It makes him look too fickle, if not like a sleaze. I finally gave up on this story when the inevitable sex scene came, occurring at the worst possible time and in the worst possible place and making the characters like complete fools. I honestly gasped, \\"What are you doing???\\" when they started up.<br /><br />The mystery is reasonably well done though, and the ending is a nice surprise. It's rare for an Intrigue these days to catch me off guard. This one did (though maybe I was simply distracted by the hero and all those \\"my Desire,\\" \\"his Desire\\"s).<br /><br />Mystery readers may find a puzzle to enjoy, if they can get past all the overwrought, silly and unbelievable plot elements. I could not.	2001-08-22

Now two more children are missing.  FBI profiler Sam Burke offers his help.  But Sam has secrets of his own and hidden motives he can't tell Abby about.  She could use his help.  Is trusting him a mistake?<br /><br />\\"The Innocent\\" gets this trilogy off to a solid, if unspectacular, start.  Two thirds of the book, the parts containing the mystery, work well.  The other third, the romance, does not.  As with her last trilogy, Gallagher Justice, Eden's Children begins with a book that has a solid mystery and a romance that takes too long to build.  (Actually, with all three of her Intrigue series, Stevens begins with a book where a cop falls for someone keeping secrets about their identity.  And the second book in each is a reunion story.  Hmmmm...)  In that book, the romance was still believable.  In \\"The Innocent,\\" it's not.<br /><br />It's always nice to read an Intrigue where the people actually investigate a case and isn't just 250 pages of running.  Stevens does a good job showing Abby and Sam as professionals who are good at their jobs.  Both are law officers who know what they're doing, and it's especially nice to see a smart, strong woman like Abby.  Readers who enjoy following clues and trying to put the case together while the hero and heroine do will find Stevens in top form.  It's too bad the sexual tension is so low.  This is one of those books where you'd think the characters would have more important things to think about than falling in love, where the suspense doesn't enhance the romance, but detracts from it.  Both Abby and Sam have personal stakes in the little girl's disappearance and most of their attention is rightly drawn to it.  The love story is almost an afterthought, thoroughly unconvincing in every way.  Every time the attention is drawn toward it andaway from the mystery, it feels forced.  Abby and Sam show little chemistry, fall in love far too quickly when they've spent most of the book thinking about the case, not each other.<br /><br />As a police procedural with a good mystery and nice twists at the end, \\"The Innocent\\" works well.  As a romance, I'm not convinced.  Fortunately, the next book, \\"The Tempted,\\" manages a happier medium.	2001-08-22
US	50735506	R2W99YV37NKQDY	037322625X	117270856	The Man From Texas (43 Light Street)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	The Man From Texas	The new 43 Light Street miniseries, Mine to Keep, kicks off in &quot;The Man From Texas,&quot; the latest by Ruth Glick writing as Rebecca York. A man wakes up in a hotel room with no memory and one million dollars in cash. Picking the name Luke Pritchard out of the phone book, he seeks help from private investigator Hannah Dawson to help her find out who he really is. Former cop Hannah finds herself drawn to this stranger. But is he a hero or a criminal?<br />Obviously, most readers probably know the answer to that one without reading the book. Unfortunately, they can probably guess everything else about this plot before it happens too. &quot;The Man From Texas&quot; is the polar opposite of the last 43 Light Street book, &quot;Amanda's Child.&quot; I started out loving that book, then ended up strongly disliking it as it went along. This time, I started out hating &quot;The Man From Texas,&quot; then grew to like it more and more as it went along. The first hundred pages, though, were rough going. I almost didn't make it past the first paragraph:<br />&quot;It was an indecent hour of the evening, at least as far as Hannah Dawson was concerned. Too early for sleep. And too late to save her immortal soul.&quot;<br />Her immortal soul? Sheesh. That kind of melodrama sets entirely the wrong tone for this story, and the paragraph is gibberish. Whether it's &quot;too late to save her...soul&quot; has nothing to do with the lateness of the hour, while &quot;too early to sleep&quot; does. The sentiment is obvious, but the sentence itself doesn't make sense. Within the first five pages, the heroine turned me off, when the author explained exactly why she's in fear for her immortal soul. It's simply ridiculous; she didn't DO anything! No one with any sense would be this concerned about their &quot;soul&quot; over what happened, or didn't happen, to her. Hannah's supposedly tragic past includes a mean, mean former lover who said some mean things to her when the tragedy struck. How mean! The problem is, I agreed with everything he said. It sounded more like the hard truth than anything mean, mean, mean, and the heroine's pouting and inability to grasp that showed what an idiot she was. We're supposed to feel bad for her that she's not a cop anymore. It's hard to feel any sympathy when she's such a pathetic mope and obviously not cut out to be a cop if she's going to let such a non-incident get to her. She also seems to be severely brain damaged (I loved when she starts out by asking Luke where he got the money. I wanted to scream &quot;HE HAS AMNESIA! HE DOESN'T KNOW, YOU TWIT!&quot;). Unlike &quot;Amanda's Child,&quot; where the hero's high-handedness toward a strong heroine annoyed me, I couldn't blame Luke for telling Hannah what to do. She needed all the help she could get. Luke was fine, though the way he didn't think twice about spending money he wasn't even sure was his was ethically questionable.<br />The author gives too much information up front. I had the entire story figured out before Page 100, making most of what came afterward and the truth about Luke too predictable. And for those who haven't read the other 43 Light Street books (and the Peregrine Connection books), the barrage of characters from those books can be overwhelming. I can't think of any 43 Light Street book that did as much name dropping as this one. Every time they turned a corner, they seemed to find someone else. (Although, those waiting for news from certain old characters might not find them here. Most of the ones mentioned are the regular faces. In other words, don't expect to hear about anyone from &quot;Whispers in the Night&quot; or &quot;Trial By Fire.&quot; I think they've been kicked out of Baltimore.)<br />Needless to say, I wasn't seeing much good in this story. Then something strange happened. The heroine got progressively stronger as the book went along, finally proving her worth toward the end. The cliffhangers became more natural and less forced or silly. And though the story never became any less predictable, it was at least well told, moving at a fast clip and offering some moving moments along the way. The action is high, and the sexual tension between the leads begins to feel more natural. The inclusion of past characters seems less intrusive and more fitting to the plot, and the suspense is kicked up a notch. While I'd figured out much of the storyline, seeing how it would all be resolved became more compelling as the author added more complications and danger to her characters. I did have one big question in the end and the coincidence that ties everyone together strains credibility. But if you're enjoying a book enough, things like that don't matter so much. In the beginning, I wasn't. In the end, I was. <br />I would give the first hundred pages two stars and the last 150 darn near five stars. That probably works out to a four. All I know is that in the beginning I was ready to give up on this series.   The way the book ended, I can't wait for the next book, &quot;Never Alone,&quot; in two months. Anyone having trouble with the beginning of this book, don't give up. It gets better.	2001-08-22

His murder destroyed Assistant District Attorney Dillon Reese's case.  Now he needs the testimony of Jacqueline's daughter, the only witness to her father's murder.  Dillon had promised to keep her ex safe.  Did Jacqueline dare listen to the cowboy lawyer when he said he could protect her daughter from the killer who now wanted her dead?<br />\\"His Witness, Her Child\\" is a hard book to review, not bad but not close to being what it should.  There aren't any huge problems.  There are many little ones that undermine the story.  As a mother, watching Dillon put Jacqueline through this ordeal for his own selfish motives (and the ultimate revelations about his past only makes them seem more selfish) was painful.  I find it hard to sympathize with a \\"hero\\" when he makes the heroine's life even more miserable than the villain does.  Perhaps Peterson did too good of a job portraying Jacqueline's panic and desperation, because I was rooting for her to get away from this guy.  Forget justice.  She had every right to try and save her child.  <br />Very little in this story rings true.  Every time they discuss Dillon's Texas roots, he tends to speak with an accent, something he never does at any other point in the book.  Inconsistent characterization isn't limited to Dillon.  Jacqueline's reaction to certain characters in the epilogue doesn't square with the way they were portrayed through the rest of the book at all.  This is especially egregious with one character.  Dillon and Jacqueline's relationship is also strangely lacking in passion.  The only time they demonstrate any fire is in the sex scene, which feels obligatory and seems to come out of nowhere.  It felt more like they were having sex because this is a romance novel and romance novels are supposed to have sex scenes, not because they were that inspired.  The author's choice of similar names for her characters (Kit and Britt, Janey and Jancey), occasionally slows the pace.  There were several instances when I had to go back and read a line to remember who was Janey and who was Jancey, in particular (\\"I thought her name was Janey...no, wait.  This is that other woman...\\")  The ending also isn't much of a surprise.<br />\\"His Witness, Her Child\\" isn't a bad book by any means.  The story flows smoothly.  There's plenty of action.  Jacqueline is a strong and sympathetic heroine.  There are just so many little flaws that I had trouble getting past.  Other readers may not have the same problems.	2001-07-22

Neither knows that there is more to the job offer than meets the eye and the rich man who hired Jill as a nanny for his grandchildren has secret motives.  Kyle Stone has been assigned to watch Jill for their employer.  The woman who arrives is nothing like the one who's been described to him.  Kyle and Ashley are drawn to each other, but how will he react when he learns she's not who he thinks she is?<br />It's not a bad idea.  Unfortunately, it's one Karr visited before in \\"Bodyguard\\" (Intrigue 309), where a woman agreed to take her twin sister's place to infiltrate a rich man's home, and fell in love with the bodyguard assigned to watch her.  There are actually more similarities which I won't mention.  The books are about even in quality.  The main difference is that this one is less suspenseful and has more of a gothic feel.  Those who have read Karr's recent Intrigues (\\"Innocent Witness,\\" \\"Mystery Dad\\"...) know her books have become more light and pleasant than gripping and suspenseful.  \\"The Mysterious Twin\\" continues this trend.  It isn't a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, but though it doesn't have much action or mystery, I was surprised to find that I was never bored at all.  Karr's writing is smooth and flows well, carrying the reader along nicely even without most of the usual surprising plot twists and dangerous situations.  Readers who are looking for romantic suspense without too much violence will find \\"The Mysterious Twin\\" highly enjoyable.  Karr uses a gothic tone and creates a nice sense of atmosphere.  Her characters are likeable, and though the ending is too abrupt, the story is well plotted.  Altogether, it is a pleasant read.  <br />Unfortunately, much of the story was ruined for me by the back cover, which revealsat least one big secret that doesn't come out until very late in the book.  I spent most of the book wondering if the back cover was wrong (they often are), since there was no mention of this element at all for the first two thirds.  Then the \\"surprise\\" revelation came.  Or it might have been a surprise if the back cover hadn't ruined it. I know exactly why the copywriter did this, and I find it unconscionable that the publisher would be willing to ruin the story just to sell more books.  In the end, I was angry that the book was ruined for me by an inconsiderate copywriter.  I might have enjoyed the story more if I didn't know what was coming.  I'll never know.<br />Leona Karr has written a pleasant story in \\"The Mysterious Twin.\\"  It might even be better if the reader is able to read it without having it spoiled first.	2001-07-22

Johnston returns for her second Intrigue with \\"Marriage: Classified.\\" This is an improvement on her first Intrigue, \\"Alias Mommy,\\" though still a lackluster tale.  Sara Shepard Dawes awakens after her wedding to find her memory gone and her police chief father dead on the floor beside her.  Her new groom, Officer Jordan Dawes, claims her father was killed by a serial killer who also murdered her brother, and who was now coming after her.  Can Sara trust this man she can't even remember marrying?<br />The back cover actually gives away more of the story (the second of this month's books to do so--something I wish the copy writers would stop), but I'll stop there.  Johnston's story has one big strong point, the suspense, and one big weakness, the romance.  The main strength of \\"Marriage: Classified\\" is the very thing Johnston didn't provide in \\"Alias: Mommy:\\" a mystery.  This book actually has one, and a fairly good one at that.  Johnston offers a number of suspects who are all equally suspicious and keeps them that way through most of the plot, not giving away who it is and keeping readers on their toes.  Those who like following clues to figure out \\"whodunit\\" will find much to enjoy in this part of the story.  Though the suspense is slight (the killer is so over-the-top I laughed out loud at one of the supposedly \\"scary\\" threats), the mystery is deftly plotted and quite impressive in its attention to detail.<br />Unfortunately, the romance falls flat because of almost the opposite reason.  Sara and Jordan are two generic characters who aren't well defined enough to make the reader care about them.  They seem like they've been generated from a computer program that assigned the most popular hooks to them:  She's a BRIDE and an AMNESIAC!  He's a COP and a TEXAN (a Texas Ranger, no less, something that's mentioned about 20 million times in this book.  If I had to read the words \\"Texas Ranger\\" one more time I was going to scream.)  Plus, he used to be a NAVY SEAL!  All that's missing is a secret baby or a pregnancy.  Thank goodness the author showed some restraint.  Sara and Jordan are familiar types, but Johnston doesn't provide enough personal detail to make them seem like any different from the other Texas cops and amnesiac brides we've seen before.  In addition, for two supposedly intelligent people, Sara and Jordan do some very foolish things at various points in the story.  The closest I came to any understanding of them was that they were stupid people.  That's not much to make me care about them or their love story.  <br />Mystery readers may find a story to enjoy in \\"Marriage: Classified.\\"  Romance readers may not feel the same way.	2001-07-22
US	50735506	R2LID7Z8UX2JKH	0373226209	690303461	The Lawman Who Loved Her (Harlequin Intrigue, No. 620)	Books	2	2	5	N	N	The Lawman Who Loved Her	Mallory Kane makes her Intrigue debut with \\"The Lawman Who Loved Her.\\"  This is a deeply flawed tale that has some decent ideas but doesn't use them to their full potential.  Three years ago a vengeful criminal shot Detective Cody Maxwell.  Now he's out on parole and terrorizing Cody and his ex-wife Dana.  Dana left Cody because his job was too dangerous.  He's the only man who can keep her safe, but is his protection worth the risk to her heart?<br />Although it gets off to a good start, \\"The Lawman Who Loved Her\\" has a number of serious problems in both the story and the execution.  The premise doesn't stand up to logic.  The idea that a criminal who deliberately shot a police officer could get parole after only three years is completely unrealistic.  (It could be this bothered me so much because I just saw the recent episode of \\"Frasier\\" where the man who shot Frasier's policeman father was denied parole eight years after that shooting, and he was nowhere near the nutcase Fontenot is.  It's true: people who shoot cops just don't get off that easy.)  Although we see quite a bit of Fontenot, he's too sketchily defined to be truly menacing.  Kane tells us only one thing about the crime Cody was pursuing Fontenot for, providing no details for far too long.  (Then again, considering what is ultimately revealed about what he is accused of doing, that might not be a bad thing.  When Kane did reveal it, I had to put the book down for a few minutes until my eyes stopped rolling.  Were we supposed to take this seriously?  It's purely silly.)  Most of Fontenot's threats on Cody and Dana seem more like childish pranks than anything frightening, making him hard to take seriously as a villain.<br />Romantic suspense is a difficult genre because the author needs to keep both the romance and suspense high throughout the story.  I've been noticing more and more new Intrigue authors who have trouble with this, and Kane is another one.  Like \\"Hers to Remember\\" and \\"Alias: Mommy\\" last year, this is a book where the author fails to balance both elements well.  There is long stretch of more than a hundred pages in the middle of the story where nothing suspenseful happens.  It's all romance.  The characters fight and cry and kiss, and fight and cry and kiss, etc..  I couldn't help thinking how nice it was that the killer was giving them all this time to work out their relationship without interrupting them.  A good sense of danger and action is vital to a story like this, where there's no mystery and we know who the bad guy is from the start.  Too often the characters seem to forget they're in danger, which makes it easy for the reader to do so too.  The killer seems to be taking his time for no reason, other than that the writer wants to focus on the love story now.  Most of this story is about 90 percent romance, 10 percent suspense.  Then there's an explosion of action, and the balance tips to 75 percent suspense, 25 percent romance.  That's not too good.<br />The characters were also weak.  Dana is a difficult \\"heroine\\" to like.  She's either crying or complaining, and the ultimate revelation about her past is all too predictable.  Cody was bland but inoffensive, until he does something late in the plot that makes him look like a complete incompetent.  If he's that dumb, he's not someone I would want protecting me.  <br />Two years ago, Jean Barrett wrote an Intrigue called \\"My Lover's Secret\\" with many of the same plot elements as this book.  It was the story of a woman being targeted for revenge by a recently released killer who murdered his wife.  The only man the heroine can turn to is an old love with a background in law enforcement.  Together, they must work through all the old hurts that kept them apart.  I would recommend that book over this one.  The characters are more courageous, and the villain truly is ingenious and very frightening.  It's a pageturner, full of danger and passion, with none of the story problems this book has.  Kane shows some talent as a writer in \\"The Lawman Who Loved Her.\\"  A stronger story would make better use of it.	2001-07-02

When the man's daughter reports her child has been kidnapped, he doesn't believe her.  After all, a mobster's daughter has to be a liar, right?  Can Amanda make this mysterious man believe her?<br />\\"Secret Bodyguard\\" reminded me a lot of Daniels's \\"Love at First Sight.\\"  In that book, all the characters were connected to one another in a dozen different ways, something that was implausible in a city the size she was describing.  In \\"Secret Bodyguard,\\" it's even worse, especially in a state the size of Texas.  \\"Love at First Sight\\" pushed the limits of believability.  \\"Secret Bodyguard\\" bulldozes straight through them.  <br />For most of the book, there are two separate stories:  the kidnapping of Amanda's daughter and the mystery of Jesse's birth.  This isn't a very successful tactic.  The stories don't progress together.  The characters focus on one, then turn to the other, then back again.  For a woman whose child is missing, Amanda doesn't have too much trouble forgetting about that while she and Jesse investigate his birth.  I had the impression the book would have been stronger if the mystery surrounding Jesse's past was left out and the story focused on the other storyline.<br />Jesse isn't much of a hero.  He continually jumps to the wrong conclusions about Amanda and his arrogance toward her is not endearing.  It does provide the book's best moment, though, when he guesses what Amanda majored in at college and she knocks him out of his seat with her answer.  There's nothing like seeing an arrogant hero get his comeuppance.  The story is fast-paced and full of action, but the romance is underwhelming.  Jesse and Amanda have very little contact for the first 75 pages of the book, which means they have to fall in love in a very short period of time.  It's not very convincing, and the love scene in particularseems forced in rather than a natural reaction on the part of the characters.  <br />Daniels does a good job setting up the next book, \\"Unconditional Surrender\\" by Joanna Wayne.  \\"Secret Bodyguard\\" is an entertaining read, but is ultimately too far-fetched to be credible.	2001-07-02

When it becomes clear the local police are intent on framing Fiona Halsey for the crime, Matt can't stand by.  Fiona doesn't trust this man who's suddenly defending her.  She suspects he's the killer himself!  Matt has no idea Fiona has some deep secrets of her own.  How will he react when he discovers who this mystery woman really is?<br />I had mixed feelings about \\"No One But You.\\"  There are several very good things about it, and several very big problems too.  This is the third book in a trilogy and it does not stand on its own.  The characters from the other books keep showing up in this one.  Unless you are interested in knowing what's happened to them since their own stories, their appearances are distracting and don't serve much purpose here.  This will be rewarding to readers who read those books.  Anyone else won't get much out of it.  The storyline is also a direct followup to events in the first two books.  The author makes a brief attempt at summarizing what's happened before, but it will be hard to understand unless you've read the other books.  I have, but it's been over a year since book two came out and I was confused.  A bigger problem is how the events in this book often are confusing on their own.  The storytelling is sometimes muddled and it's hard to tell what's going on at times.  In the end, I had a general idea what the entire story was about, but I would have a hard time explaining the individual details.  <br />That is not to say I didn't enjoy parts of  \\"No One But You.\\"  The case the undercover agents have been investigating in all three books takes on an international aspect in this book, which is a nice change from most Intrigues.  Fiona is also a British heroine with a fresh, unique life history.  In spite of the ranch setting, the story feels unique because ofthese different elements Bishop adds to her story, which is always nice.  Though the story as a whole is sometimes hard to follow, some isolated scenes work very well.  <br />I can't recommend this book, not on its own anyway.  Anyone interested in \\"No One But You\\" should buy \\"No Baby But Mine\\" and \\"No Bride But His\\" first and read them back-to-back-to-back, or reread the others first.	2001-06-13

Detective Ginny Rafferty is driven by the unsolved murder of her sister more than a decade ago.  Now a body has been found that could be connected to her sister's death.  Ginny needs answers, and the only way she can get them is to cooperate with Brett Taylor, who grew up in the neighborhood.  Can she handle being his fake fiancee for the length of this case, or will she forget that it's a ruse?<br /><br />I really didn't care for Miller's first Intrigue, \\"One Good Man,\\" a story I found too predictable and familiar.  \\"Sudden Engagement\\" is better in every way, featuring strong characters, a well paced plot, and an excellent mystery.  I remember the days ten years ago or so when I could count on a good mystery in every Intrigue I picked up.  That's rarer now, with many writers telling simple on-the-run stories or tales where the killer is too easily deduced.  So I was delighted to find in \\"Sudden Engagement\\" a well thought-out mystery, the kind with a number of suspects and clues and doesn't feel like the author came up with it in five minutes.  Miller drops clues with ease.  I figured it out before the characters did, but this is still one puzzle romantic mystery lovers will enjoy trying to solve.  Old secrets and a good sense of danger enhance the tale.  Add a stirring romance between two warm, courageous characters, and this is everything I like to see in an Intrigue.<br /><br />I genuinely liked the heroine, a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability.  It took a while for me to warm up to Brett.  His attempts to protect Ginny from seeing anything he deems too difficult for a lady are often annoying, especially considering her profession, such as when he tries to keep her from viewing a dead body in Chapter One.<br /><br />Brett: \\"You can't go in there.\\"<br />Me: \\"She's a cop.  You're an idiot.  Get out of her way.\\"<br /><br />At least his heart's in the right place, and he's nothing like the jerk who was the hero of \\"One Good Man.\\"  Brave and bold, he's the right match for Ginny.  The two of them have excellent chemistry.  Miller also does a good job introducing other members of Brett's family in a way that feels unobtrusive.  It's obvious they're being set up for their own stories, but it doesn't feel like they're being thrown in for that reason only.  She actually finds reasons for them to appear.<br /><br />The only reservation I have about the story is the sudden engagement itself.  Like most books based on a hook, the one used in \\"Sudden Engagement\\" is gratuitous.  There is absolutely no reason for Brett and Ginny to pretend to be engaged.  They could pretend to be dating.  He could go with her on her interviews to vouch for her and get people to open up.  That works the first time they try it.  Brett even suggests they pretend to be dating at first.  It's Ginny that comes up with the engagement idea, probably because fake fiancees are a plot hook.  It's never clear why she takes it this far, and that nagging element did bother me whenever it came up.  (One more thing:  whoever wrote the back cover copy should be fired.  \\"Beckoning broad shoulders?\\"  Yeccccch.)<br /><br />A rating ultimately comes down to how much I enjoyed the book, and I enjoyed this one too much to give it anything less than five stars.  \\"Sudden Engagement\\" is a very well-written, original tale of romantic suspense that shouldn't be missed.  One of the year's best.	2001-06-13

One stormy night undercover cop Caleb Carlisle appears on her doorstep.  He claims he and his partner were ambushed in their sting operation.  Shannon's not interested in getting involved with another cop, but she can't turn him away.  She also can't resist him.  Can she trust him to protect her from the danger he brings into her world, and with her heart?<br />I wasn't a fan of the author's first Intrigue, \\"Hers to Remember.\\"  Luckily, \\"Conception Cover-Up\\" is better in every way.  Shannon and Caleb are much better heroes, because they're so much more interesting.  Caleb may be another cop hero, but at least he's not boring.  A strong, honorable man, he's given a compelling back story that helps us understand why he does what he does throughout the book and makes him easy to root for, unlike the hero of HTR, who had little dimension and was just \\"nice.\\"  Similarly, Shannon's story makes us understand her reluctance to be with Caleb.  As a result, the love story is so much more dramatic.  These are rich, three-dimensional characters with intricate lives.  We know more about them than just the action plot they're involved in, so we care about them and really want to see them succeed in the end.<br />The story is mostly well plotted and packed with suspense.  Unlike HTR, there are several twists in the storyline.  I was sure I knew who the bad guy was, only to have Barrett fool me, then do it again later.  There is plenty of action spread throughout the story.  The love scenes are sensual and the characters' chemistry is powerful.  The book only falters near the end.  The climax comes too early, resulting in an ending that goes on and on and on forever.  I was ready for the book to be over long before it was, I was so exhausted by the end.  But that's a small price to payfor the great story that comes before it.<br />One item unrelated to the author's work:  (Rant starts now) \\"Conception Cover-Up\\" is an excellent book, one of the best of the year.  It certainly doesn't deserve to have one of the worst Intrigue titles EVER.  If I didn't pick up every Intrigue by habit, I never would have bought a book called \\"Conception Cover-Up.\\"  It doesn't even make sense.  There IS a conception (No use avoiding it.  Harlequin splashes that fact all over the cover), but it is never covered up.  There is NO conception cover-up in this story.  The characters don't exactly run around yelling, \\"We're having a baby,\\" but they also don't engage in the kind of large scale plotting and scheming that the words \\"cover up\\" imply.  When I think cover-up, I think people being murdered and blackmailed and bribed to keep some information secret.  That isn't even close to what this story is about.  What are they talking about?  What does it mean???  Of course, whoever wrote the back cover copy is also calling this a secret baby story.  It certainly isn't a secret in the way we usually think of secret babies.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the way the child aspect came about in the story.  It didn't feel as contrived like many secret baby stories do.  Barrett has put a nice spin on a familiar element and made this an interesting new story all her own.  Too bad someone at Harlequin doesn't want you to know that.  (end rant)<br />In any case, any regular Intrigue reader knows she can't judge these books by their covers these days.  What's inside is what matters, and inside \\"Conception...\\" is a fast paced suspense tale and emotional love story.  It's the kind of book that gives Intrigue a good name.  Too bad Intrigue didn't return the favor.	2001-05-16

A baby is found on the doorstep of a prominent Washington D.C. couple, and Detective Mel Haskin is on the case.  Everywhere he looks, reporter Lily Markey is there.  Mel suspects the beautiful lady knows more about the baby than she's saying.  Can Lily trust the by-the-book cop with her secrets?<br /><br />\\"Familiar Lullaby\\" is a prime example of why this series is so good.  Burnes somehow manages to combine all the elements of a great read in one smooth, fast-paced tale.  One of the author's trademarks is her strong heroines and Lily is no exception.  She's the kind of strong, feisty woman who will do anything to help someone in need, never mind the risk to herself.  Mel is her equal, a hard-headed cop with a strong sense of duty and honor.  He also has a moving back story that's seamlessly introduced, sad without being overwrought.  There's genuine tension between them as they clash over this case.  Familiar fans will be happy to know that Clotilde takes a starring role of her own this time.  The kitty detective is his usual genius self, knowing exactly what clues to give the humans and when to play matchmaker when he has to.<br /><br />Most of all, \\"Familiar Lullaby\\" is just plain fun to read.  Many Intrigues are able to provide the romance and the suspense, but I can't remember the last time I had this much fun reading a book.  The line \\"I laughed, I cried,\\" is a cliché, but with this book I did that and more.  I laughed at Familiar's antics and couldn't help being impressed at how much smarter this cat is than most humans.  I shivered at the terrible villain and was moved by the dilemma faced by the baby's mother.  I was left holding on to the edge of my chair at the suspenseful passages, which made up most of the book, because Burnes is always surprising the reader.  Most Intrigue writers these days settle for straightforward stories withfew twists.  With Burnes, I know I can count on a complex plot with plenty of unexpected turns along the way.  Somehow the author is able to juggle so many diverse elements into one seamless, delightful read.  Her books feel like bigger stories, because she gives you so much more in them.  The result is sheer reading pleasure.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm not crazy with how many Intrigues these days are about the same subject.  Three of this month's books (out of four!) are about babies.  If you can only get one, this is the one to choose.  It may be based on a hook, but this is a story you haven't read before.  Whether this is your first Familiar book or your fourteenth, \\"Familiar Lullaby\\" is a must-read.	2001-05-16

For the 43 Light Street series, that weak entry is &quot;Amanda's Child.&quot;  After such recent stunners as &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; &quot;Midnight Caller,&quot; and &quot;Never Too Late,&quot; this is a big disappointment. When Amanda Barnwell made the decision to get pregnant through artificial insemination, she didn't know it would put her in danger.  A powerful man who believes his dead son was the sperm donor would do anything to get his hands on her baby.  He doesn't count on Matthew Forester overhearing his plan.  Matthew has been attracted to Amanda from the first time he saw her.  Can he keep her and her baby safe?<br />&quot;Amanda's Child&quot; begins very well with a fast opening (everything explained about happens in the first ten pages) and taut suspense.  A couple chapters into it I was thinking, &quot;This is why I read Intrigues.&quot;  It was that good.  But starting with Chapter Four or Five, the story falls apart.  By the end, I was very unsatisfied.  A story that began with great promise fell into a muddled mess.<br />The weakest part of the story was the heroine.  Amanda is constantly described as a strong person who took over her father's ranch after his illness.  With one exception early on, we never see this part of her.  Matthew completely takes over, telling her what she's going to do now, planning every part of their escape, not allowing her any input in her own fate.  As a result, Amanda becomes a supporting character in her own story.  Especially galling was one scene where she apologized to him for demanding to know what was going on.  It's her life and her baby in danger.  She shouldn't have to ask the &quot;hero&quot; not to keep things from her.  For those who like men who take over women's lives, for their own good or otherwise, here's a hero for you.  I was unimpressed by his high-handedness.  It's a good thing the book wasn't called &quot;Matthew's Child.&quot;  We would have had no idea if it referred to the baby or Amanda.<br />There are also problems with the story.  What seems like a clear plot with a tight focus eventually becomes unwieldy and all over the map.  Glick has trouble maintaining the suspense for the entire book.  Too often her characters seem to forget they're even in any danger.  I was baffled more than once, wondering why Matthew and Amanda were doing things that could have waited until after they were out of danger.  The romance is forced, happening too fast to be believed.  The appearance by a character from another book in this series is welcome, although it only demonstrates how far this book is from that one, one of the best Light Street Books ever. <br />The beginning of this book is so good that I can't completely condemn it.  Or it could be that my reaction wouldn't be as harsh if it wasn't as strong.  I'm willing to allow the series one weak entry, since it's been years since I've had such a negative reaction to a Light Street book.  Let's hope the next book finds the series back in good form.	2001-04-25

Years ago, it was Agent Nicole Reed's job to see that Ian Michaels failed at his mission.  Now she needed him to keep her alive.  The last case they worked together was coming back to haunt them.  Could Nicole trust Ian with her life?<br /><br />I was looking forward to this, Webb's most original Intrigue so far.  This is a talented author and I was curious to see what she could do without secret babies or amnesiacs involved, so I was surprised at how strongly I disliked this story.  First the good points.  I liked that Webb didn't drag out the secret of what really happened on the case Nicole and Ian worked together.  The truth came out early and exactly the right time (early enough that it didn't feel like the back cover was ruining anything by revealing it).  The book is well-written with a number of exciting action sequences.  The new Colby agents who are introduced are likable and interesting, which is a good sign for their upcoming stories.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those secondary characters only helped to show how unsympathetic and unlikeable the main characters were.  What ruined the book for me was Ian and Nicole and the nasty edge to their \\"romance.\\"  Those who appreciate stories where the couple gets to know each other and falls in love won't find it here.  \\"Protective Custody\\" falls in the dreaded category of the \\"I hate you-I want you-I hate you-I want you-I hate you...\\" romance, where the characters do nothing but yell at each other, then have sex, then yell at each other, then have sex, etc. for the whole book.<br /><br />Ian is the kind of \\"hero\\" I dislike the most, a domineering control freak who tries to run the heroine's life and does everything he can to keep her from making a decision for herself.  I would have enjoyed the way Nicole got the better of Ian time and again, except that most of her actions make her seem foolish andconstantly put her in danger.  What bothered me the most was the way their antagonism fueled their sexual relationship.  Every time they had sex (and there is quite a bit in this book), it was out of anger or revenge or trying to trick or manipulate the other person by turning them on, never about trust or affection or mutual desire.  I don't know which bothered me more, the scene in the cabin or in the woods.  I don't consider myself a prude, but reading about two people using and abusing each other this way wasn't sexy, it felt sleazy.  Nicole refers to it as making love.  Where was the love? After watching these two be cruel and hateful to one another for most of the book, the deeper emotions they suddenly display toward the end did not ring true. Reading about characters who refuse to let the other person \\"have the satisfaction\\" of knowing how they feel doesn't do much for me, especially when I don't believe what they think they're feeling.  In the end I didn't believe they liked each other, let alone loved each other.  I also didn't have any idea why they should.<br /><br />I'm giving \\"Protective Custody\\" two stars.  It's well written and half of the romantic suspense formula is there, but I can't say that I enjoyed reading this book.  I think it's possible to show a strong hero and equally strong heroine without making them hateful.  Some recent examples are \\"Midnight Remembered\\" (Intrigue 591), \\"To Die For\\" (Intrigue 595), and \\"Mystery Bride\\" (Intrigue 604), books with courageous heroes and smart, capable heroines.  \\"Protective Custody\\" is a reasonably good story about two people who enjoy \\"doing it.\\"  An emotional story about two people falling in love, this is not.	2001-04-25
US	50735506	R1DQ8LIEWA63DH	0373226098	849631561	Undercover Baby	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Undercover Baby	This month's Top Secret Baby comes from Adrianne Lee in \\"Undercover Baby.\\"  Months after her baby died at birth, Joanna Edwards learns that her child is alive.  Her hunt for the baby's midwife, who disappeared after the birth, leads her to Cade Maconahey, the woman's ex-husband.  Cade has enough on his hands with the baby his ex-wife left with him, the child he never knew he had.  Can he help Joanna find hers?<br />Lee puts an entirely different twist on the usual secret child plot that makes this a cut above the rest.  I enjoyed the way she turned this cliché on its head and made her story one of a kind.  I've never seen an author do what Lee does here and I liked it a lot.  (That doesn't mean I want to see it repeated a hundred times by other authors, thank you.)  The Top Secret Babies miniseries has featured better than normal secret child stories, but what they've also had in common was some very fast-paced, gripping stories.  \\"Undercover Baby\\" is no exception.  Like Lee's best work, this is a true pageturner, packed with emotion and suspense.  The pace is blistering, never letting up for a moment and Joanna's search will grab reader's hearts.  Though there's not much in the way of character growth and Joanna and Cade are pretty thinly developed, they are likable and easy to root for.  <br />There are a lot of books that claim to be romantic suspense, and while most of them put their characters in dangerous situations , few of them really keep me on the edge of my seat, gripping the book tightly and anxiously turning pages.  This is one.  Like her last book, \\"Little Boy Lost,\\" \\"Undercover Baby\\" has a true sense of suspense.  Lee is also one of the few authors able to write a reliably good mystery, and here she has penned another one.  She has a good grasp of her suspects, knows how to drop clues, and offers a surprising and satisfying resolution.   <br />\\"Undercover Baby\\" is an excellent romance told in Lee's singular style, with the perfect balance of suspenseand mystery.  If all secret child books were as good as this and the last few Top Secret Babies have been, I might be more excited about them.  Don't miss this one.	2001-04-09

Readers looking for steamy suspense will find it here, though some may wish the authors had written a trilogy of three separate books so they could have had more of these stories.<br /><br />Rebecca York begins the set with \\"Tyler.\\"  An undercover federal agent is surprised when his latest case brings him into the life of the sister of his boyhood friend.  Tyler feels he let her brother down.  When killers chase them into the bayou, can he do right by her?  York doesn't have much room to tell her story, since she has to provide the prologue that sets up the trilogy and the events that lead into the next two tales.  Eighty pages isn't much to tell a whole story.  As a result, there isn't much to \\"Tyler,\\" a straightforward couple-on-the-run tale with few surprises but good suspense and a high level of sensuality.  There aren't many twists and some may have trouble believing these two could fall in love in such a short period of time.  Good atmosphere and page-turning suspense do compensate.  Fans of constant action and steamy love scenes will find them here.  Four Stars.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best story in the set doesn't come from an Intrigue author but from Metsy Hingle.  In \\"Nick,\\" a man returns to his hometown for his brother's wedding to the only woman he's ever loved.  When his brother is murdered, Nick becomes the prime suspect.  Can he find the truth and reclaim the only woman for him?  Hingle's story is the best because she manages to combine all the elements of a full-length Intrigue into her eighty pages.  Both characters have interesting and involved histories that make them seem more three-dimensional.  Hingle keeps her characters in constant danger, but she also spaces her story over several days.  It is fast-paced but doesn't feel rushed.  This is the only story where I really felt like the characters had a chance to talk about their relationship.  By the end I was convinced they would last as a couple.  A good mystery, dangerous situations and enjoyable antagonists make this a joy to read.  It's not  easy to pull off in eighty pages (some writers can't do it in 250).  Hingle does it with ease.  Five stars.<br /><br />Joanna Wayne finishes the set with \\"Jules.\\"  A murder brings Jules close to the truth of the man out to get him and his friends.  It also reunites him with his first love.  Can Jules protect her when her involvement with him puts her in danger?  Wayne's story is a solid follow-up to the second one.  It has some good character development and twists along the way.  The climax is somewhat weak.  The dangerous situation the characters find themselves in is so contrived I couldn't understand how this could be happening to intelligent people.  Wayne does offer some chilling scenes and confrontations with a truly evil villain to keep readers turning the pages and the romance is solid.  Four Stars.<br /><br />The Louisiana bayou country is a setting that has mostly been forgotten in Intrigues (out of the last 100 Intrigues, only one full novel and one novella were set in Louisiana, both in New Orleans).  It's a shame these stories couldn't have been offered as three separate books to allow readers to spend more time in this setting and the authors more time to build their stories.  The idea was strong enough to support a trilogy.  For what it is though, readers looking for fast reads will enjoy \\"Bayou Blood Brothers,\\" so much they'll probably wish there was more of it.	2001-03-16

Devlin Hawke made it clear he never wanted a family.  Can Karen dare to hope he'll find their child and become a father for her?<br />That summary doesn't do justice to this story (it makes it sound like a hundred other books).  I can't say more without giving away the plot.  I will say that the reasons behind the child's kidnapping are unlike almost anything I've read before in an Intrigue.  Unlike most secret child Intrigues, which use predictable motives and expected suspense plots, this one kept me guessing.  This is a book the only gets better as it goes along.  The revelations that come out along the way are original and suspenseful.  Barrett writes with a gritty style and fast pace that pulls the reader in and keeps her turning the pages.  As Karen and Devlin learn the truth about her husband, the story builds to a stunning climax.  The final fifty pages are absolutely thrilling, full of unexpected twists and breathless suspense.  Fans of great suspense thrillers will find an excellent one here.<br />The book does have one serious flaw that keeps me from giving it a full five stars.  This is the most I've enjoyed a child book in a long time but that's not because of the secret child part.  That part is the book's biggest problem.  The reason for Karen and Devlin's separation is one of the oldest cliches.  Worse, Barrett doesn't offer enough time in Devlin's head.  For instance, out of the first seventy pages only 2 and a half are spent in his point of view.  I would say that in the whole book about thirty or less are told from his perspective.  This doesn't allow us to get to know Devlin and understand him as much as we need to.  Devlin has to do the most changing over the course of the story to turnfrom a man who refuses to be a father to one ready to make that commitment.  His response to learning he was a father made me furious and for most of the book I didn't like the man. Though all is explained, in the end I didn't see enough to make the change believable.  The result is a romance that is somewhat lacking.<br />\\"The Hunt for Hawke's Daughter\\" is an excellent book in spite of the secret child part and the lack of insight into the hero's growth.  I recommend it on the strength of its plot, not its characters.  It is a masterful thriller with true originality, a couple that actually investigates the mystery and a wonderful ending.  Anyone who is tired of secret babies, this one is worth the risk.	2001-03-16

Hitting her with his car gives her amnesia (what else?).   &quot;Mary&quot; is in danger (of course).  Can you guess who will protect her from what she can't remember?  <br />&quot;Private Vows&quot; is one of those stories where strong writing pulls in the reader, helping to disguise the weaknesses in the plot for a while.  The strongest part of &quot;Private Vows&quot; is Steward's smooth story-telling style.  Unfortunately, the story she's chosen to tell is thin and full of problems.  Steward is able to cast a spell with her words and strong characterizations.  Deep down though, she's not saying too much.  <br />Is &quot;Private Vows&quot; suspenseful?  Occasionally.  Is it pretty stupid?  Definitely.  Where to start?  The premise is ridiculous, another book where all it takes is a bump on the head for the heroine to get amnesia.  Worse, Mary's amnesia is so contrived that it just seems dumb.  Mary remembers plenty of things when it's needed to develop her character.  She just doesn't remember anything that might show who she is or what happened to her.  (For instance, she remembers everything about her parents, but not their names.)  Everything she remembers and when is conveniently dictated by the requirements of the story.  Amnesia books seldom give an accurate depiction of what amnesia victims go through but this one had me laughing at how contrived it was.  Poor Mary.  She remembers everything except what she can't to keep the plot going.  Give me a break.<br />Other than Cole, Mary and Cole's cop friend, there are only two characters in the book.  I looked at the cast of characters in the front of the book before I started reading and I automatically picked out the killer.  (Once again, two suspect mysteries are bad mysteries).  The mystery element is also poorly plotted.  Mary and Cole's investigation spends too much time going nowhere.  Too much of this book feels like they--and the reader--are treading water, waiting for a killer any smart reader has already picked out to make a move.  Looking back after I finished the book, I couldn't figure out what took this person so long.  How nice of the villain to stay out of the way long enough for Cole and Mary to fall in love.  <br />Any patience I might have had left with this book was destroyed by the last fifty pages. Then there's the final confrontation, which never would have taken place if the characters were using their heads.  Their actions made no sense.  The scene that sets this up had me shaking my head and saying, &quot;Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.&quot;  A real wallbanger moment.  The book continues with too much romantic hand wringing after the mystery is over that only pads the length of the story.  We know these two are meant to be together.  We know they will be together (romance novel, right?).  Delaying the obvious for no good reason is dull and pointless.  Worse, there is an unresolved feeling to the ending that undermines the essential happy ending romance novels require. I was uncomfortable with it.<br />Steward sprinkles some chilling scenes throughout her book but the contrived and manipulative plotting and poor mystery weaken it overall.  It's easy to enjoy Steward's storytelling if you don't think about the story and expect it to make much sense.  The best part of &quot;Private Vows?&quot;  If Intrigue keeps publishing amnesia books this bad, people will eventually stop buying them and they'll stop publishing them.  That's a day we can all look forward to.	2001-02-27

Amy Thomas is shocked twice in one day when her child's secret father appears and a dead body is unearthed at a construction site.  One threatens her heart.  The secret of the other threatens her life.  Can Jake save Amy, win her heart and create a family with her?<br />&quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; is really two books: a fairly good mystery plot and a boring secret child story that uses every cliché in the book.  If you can find anything in the circumstances of Amy and Jake's separation that you haven't read in dozens of other books, you haven't read enough of these books (Lucky You!).  I spent much of &quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; counting all the many cliches.  The mystery element is far stronger.  There are some juicy secrets to be uncovered and plenty of danger.  Late in the book, the story picks up some steam with good action and some twists.  Unfortunately, there's more of the secret child nonsense than the mystery.  After being pulled away from the mystery too many times, I started to lose interest in it too.  The suspects aren't developed enough for us to guess who it could be or why.  By the end I was having a hard time understanding why I should care who did it.<br />I don't think you can dismiss secret child books simply because they involve a secret baby.  Recent titles like &quot;The Bodyguard's Baby&quot; and &quot;The Agent's Secret Child&quot; have used this hook effectively to create compelling stories.  Unfortunately books like &quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; are why many readers are growing unhappy with its overuse.  Secret babies by themselves aren't interesting; it's what the author does with it, the emotions she has her characters go through.  There is nothing interesting about what Sinclair does with it here.  The characters repeat the same arguments we've read a million times before.  Frankly I didn't care about them because I've read about these characters before.  There was nothing special about Amy or Jake.  Without a strong plot, strong characters are critical.  This book didn't have them.  There is only one interesting character in this book:  a teenage boy.  I kept thinking about Rafe and Kendra from Sinclair's last book, &quot;The Specialist.&quot;  They had complicated pasts and much depth.  Amy and Jake do not.  <br />Well-written but uninspired, the book is as unremarkable as its title.  Two years after the Intrigue editors renamed Adrianne Lee's &quot;The Real Mac Coy&quot; &quot;The Best-Kept Secret,&quot; we get &quot;Best-Kept Secrets.&quot;  They make it sound like a rehash, and in many ways it is.  That isn't to say it's awful.  Out of the four books in this series, &quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; is probably tied with &quot;My Baby My Love&quot; in terms of quality.  It's better than &quot;The Silent Witness,&quot; not as good as &quot;For His Daughter.&quot;  It's not as confusing or muddled as TSW but it's also not as exciting or emotional as FHD.  It's boring.  More of the mystery, none of the secret child muddle would have improved it.  Overall, I would recommend &quot;For His Daughter&quot; or Sinclair's recent Texas Confidential book over this one.	2001-02-27
US	50735506	R2H6OZ8H4DGARN	0373226012	185493021	Saving His Son (Top Secret Babies, Book 2) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #601)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Saving His Son	In 1996, Harlequin Intrigue published \\"A Baby's Cry\\" by Amanda Stevens (Intrigue 388), the story of a woman who is told her child died at birth.  She begins receiving anonymous notes that her son is actually alive.  She goes to the child's secret father, a police detective.  Will he help her find the truth?  Now Intrigue is publishing \\"Saving His Son\\" by Rita Herron (Intrigue 601), the story of a woman who is told her child died at birth.  She begins receiving anonymous notes that her son is actually alive.  She goes to the child's secret father, a police detective.  Will he help her find the truth?<br />Sound familiar? <br />It's another case of Intrigue deja vu (and from the looks of it, two months from now, we'll be seeing this story again in Adrianne Lee's \\"Undercover Baby\\").  The secret baby hook is one thing.  A story based on such a similar premise is harder to accept.  Stevens's book was almost perfect, with the exception of about 500 scenes where the characters stand at windows staring out into the night.  Herron's can't help but suffer in comparison.  The similarity is unfortunate.  This is the best book Herron has produced for the Intrigue line.<br />\\"Saving His Son\\" contains none of the flaws of her previous books:  the slow pacing and repetitiveness of \\"Send Me a Hero,\\" the awkward prose of \\"Her Eyewitness,\\" or the passive heroine, obvious ending, selfish hero and soap opera weepiness of the dismal \\"Forgotten Lullaby.\\"  The storytelling is brisk, packing plenty of plot in 250 pages.  The heroine is a woman who is distraught over the loss of her son.  She is still strong enough to fight to get him back, unlike the heroine of her last book, who seemed content to sit around and be victimized.  She shows strength and cleverness, earning the title of \\"heroine.\\"  Unlike so many secret child stories, it was nice to read one where the father doesn't throw a fit about not being told, but acknowledges how he was at fault.  That's a real man, and a real hero.  There is emotion and angst, but the plot never comes to a complete stop to allow the characters to wallow in it.  \\"Saving His Son\\" is the first real page-turner Herron has written.<br />To her credit, Herron is one of the few new Intrigue writers actually bothering to attempt to write the kind of story this series was built on: a mystery.  After four books, she finally wrote a good one.  Her last book, the awful \\"Forgotten Lullaby,\\" took the approach of all bad mystery writers:  she tried to make the ending a \\"surprise\\" by having the characters suspect everyone except the actual villain.  Never mind that she spoiled the surprise in the first chapter.  This only made the characters look foolish (they're suspecting everyone they know, including friends and family, and yet they never manage to suspect the one person who has complete access to their lives???)  and the obvious tactic  made it clear to smart readers who would end up being the villain (why else would she being trying so hard to divert attention from this person?).  I mention this only because \\"Saving His Son\\" is so superior it's hard to believe the books were written by the same person, though Herron's storytelling style makes it clear they are.  The mystery keeps throwing surprises at the reader.  There is a large group of suspects, all of whom are kept equally suspicious until late in the book.  It's nearly impossible to know who the kidnapper is and the ending is a surprise.  That's the sign of a good Intrigue.<br />\\"Saving His Son\\" is a story with likeable characters, strong emotion and good plot twists combined in a highly entertaining read.  Readers who aren't immediately reminded of the earlier book will enjoy it even more.	2001-02-14

Daniels offers up a refreshing change of pace in \\"Mystery Bride.\\"  Will Sheridan meets a mysterious young woman at a party and falls in love at first sight.  The woman gives him a passionate kiss and disappears.  What he doesn't know is that Samantha Murphy is a private investigator and his attempt to track her down lands him in the middle of her latest case.  Suddenly he's on the run with Sam, with bodies falling everywhere they turn and murderers on their trail.  Will they survive long enough for him to learn all of this woman's secrets?<br /><br />In spite of the misleading and fraudulent title, which would have been perfect for Intrigue 603 (This book has nothing to do with weddings or brides.  Harlequin editors, shame on you.), Daniels's book is surprisingly and wonderfully original. No cop heroes, no cowboys, no weddings, no secret agents, no secret babies (well, sort of), no Texas.  There is a child involved, but he's used better than in most books that play up the presence of children on the back cover.  It doesn't feel like he was tacked on because kids are required in romances these days.  He's an integral part of the plot in a complex romantic mystery.  \\"Mystery Bride\\" has a neat puzzle involving computers, a subject that isn't used in too many Intrigues.  There's plenty of action and mayhem to keep readers turning the pages.  The characters are likeable and the way Daniels uses Samantha's point of view is humorous.  Fans of strong heroines will find one here.  This is an entertaining read.<br /><br />The sense of freshness does help carry the reader past some of weaknesses in the story.  The setup, though entertaining and fast-paced, is purely silly and the romance virtually disappears for about 75 pages at one point when the plot takes over.  I'm pretty forgiving if Intrigues have an emphasis of plot over romance (Sharon Green's recent \\"To Die For\\" is one example), and for a while, the investigation is interesting enough that the lack of romance didn't bother me.  The weak ending did bother me.  I like surprising endings, but this one seemed like the \\"came out of nowhere\\" variety.  We know too little about the secondary characters to be able to figure out who it could be.  Daniels could have changed the villain's identity and I'm not sure we would have known the difference.  The ending simply isn't set up very well.  (Examples of better surprising endings would be Daniels's \\"Undercover Christmas\\" and \\"Intimate Secrets.\\") I also had at least one question that remained unanswered.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fresh, light and exciting read that doesn't feel like they've read it a hundred times before.  Fans shouldn't be disappointed.  It's not the author's best work, but it is an entertaining ride.	2001-02-14

Kendra has personal reasons to want to see this criminal punished.  Rafe may have met his match in the tough-as-nails Kendra.  But can he keep her safe when trouble starts to follow her everywhere she goes?<br /><br />There are several aspects that make \\"The Specialist\\" the best book of this popular miniseries.  It's the only one of the \\"Texas Confidential\\" books where the agency comes to life and we can feel the connections between the agents.  I got a better sense of the group from this book than any of the others.  The mystery is also complicated without being convoluted and never becomes as muddled or confusing as some of this author's other works.  \\"The Specialist\\" is her best book since \\"For His Daughter.\\"  It's full of surprises and suspenseful moments in a well-plotted tale.<br /><br />Most of all, I enjoyed the depth of the characters.  Kendra is a smart and tough heroine whose history is revealed in an interesting way.  Fans of a Cinderella story will enjoy how this woman who thinks she's plain is shown how beautiful she is.  Rafe is the bad boy you can't help loving.  Over the course of the book, they have real character growth, which is too rare in these short books.  Sinclair's talent for dialogue pays off in the banter between the two and there are many amusing lines.  This pair is evenly matched and it's fun to watch them slowly realize their love for one another.<br /><br />For a book filled with strong characters, good mystery, humorous dialogue and a passionate romance, \\"The Specialist\\" is a top-notch read.	2001-01-29

The secretive Lexie Dale tells him what happened but Lucas senses she's hiding something.  It soon becomes clear the danger isn't over and only Lucas can protect her.  Who is this woman and what secret is she hiding?<br />Gordon doesn't reveal the answer until a hundred pages in, but the title and back cover summary go out of their way to spoil it.  In case there's actually someone who can't figure it out, I won't mention it.  It's probably worth mentioning though that, unlike some books where the back cover spoils a big secret and diminishes the enjoyment of the book, &quot;Royal Protector&quot; is a strong enough story that it doesn't matter.  Gordon has proven to be a master storyteller over the years and she's only gotten better with each new book.  She has a pleasing voice and an engaging writing style I really enjoy which pulls the reader in.  This is one of the best &quot;royal&quot; romances I've read.<br />Lucas and Lexie are strong characters who feel normal enough that they seem like real people we might know despite the romantic archetypes they embody.  The large cast of characters is filled with unique and amusing people, each of whom makes an impression.  The western setting is evoked well without dipping into any of the usual cowboy cliches.  Although some late developments push the story into soap opera territory, the emotional payoff is worth it.  <br />Gordon is an author with a strong voice and a pleasing storytelling style.  \\"Royal Protector\\" is one of her best.	2001-01-22

The grown-up flower child claims she's seen a dead criminal walking around alive and well.  Not only is there no proof of her story, but Matt's having a hard time proving Jenna even exists.  The law firm she says she works at claims not to know her. There's a strange old woman living in the apartment Jenna claims as her own.  Is Jenna nuts? Or is Matt the crazy one for believing her?<br /><br />I don't know how Allen is able to get away with writing fresh storylines and quirky characters, but I'm glad she is. Her stories are breaths of fresh air in the stale world of category romance.  \\"Woman Most Wanted\\" is a tale that combines mystery,  humor, suspense and romance in one wonderful read.  This is one fun book.  There are so many unforgettable moments to savor: Jenna's monologue about television on page 59, one of the most emotional scenes I've read in a romance recently, involving--believe it or not--a cat, and best of all, a priceless confrontation in Chapter Nine that had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />\\"Woman Most Wanted\\" is an unusual Intrigue, with a twisting plot and unique characters we haven't seen before. The humorous elements work because they're easy and unforced. Jenna is well-drawn and sympathetic, offbeat without being either annoying or dingy--not an easy task. Books where heroines are being made to look crazy, with no way to prove they're telling the truth, are always intriguing (there's even another one this month, Debra Webb's \\"The Bodyguard's Baby\\"), and Jenna is a heroine who is easy to root for.  A man willing to stand by the heroine and listen to his heart instead of his head is always heroic, and Matt is no exception.  One thing that makes \\"Woman Most Wanted\\" stand out is the richness of the characters.  As in Allen's first two books, even the most minor of characters are surprisingly well drawn, from a waitress to a group of hookers, receiving more depth in a sentence or two than more major characters do in whole books by other authors.<br /><br />I probably liked this one a little bit less than Allen's last book, \\"Twice Tempted.\\" It's not as seamlessly plotted, one big misunderstanding near the end is disappointing and one huge coincidence that is revealed late is a little hard to swallow.  Even so, \\"Woman Most Wanted\\" is a surprising and unique  romantic suspense tale unlike any other you're likely to have read lately.  The mystery is compelling, the passion is steamy and the twists never stop.  \\"Woman Most Wanted\\" is a true original and a delightful read that shouldn't be missed.	2001-01-15
US	50735506	R1MYH22MHHUH4C	0373225970	886347013	The Bodyguard's Baby (The Colby Agency: Top Secret Babies, Book 2) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #597)	Books	4	5	8	N	N	The Bodyguard's Baby	Debra Webb kicks off a new line of secret child books with \\"The Bodyguard's Baby.\\"  Two years after the woman he was supposed to be guarding disappeared, Nick Foster learns that Laura Proctor has been spotted.  He goes after her, intending to return her to her brother as he was originally hired to do.  Laura claims her baby is missing, only she can't prove she has a baby and all the evidence is disappearing.  Someone is trying to make Laura look crazy.  Can she hope that Nick will believe her without giving away the secret of her baby's father?<br /><br />\\"The Bodyguard's Baby\\" is a big step up for Webb from her first Intrigue, \\"Safe By His Side.\\"  In this taut, compelling thriller, the author's relentless pacing dares the reader to leave the edge of her seat.  The mystery is far superior to that in \\"Safe By His Side,\\" full of old secrets and hidden motives (though again, only two suspects makes it a little too easy to guess who the villain will turn out to be).  The heroine is also better.  Laura is stronger and more courageous for everything she has to go through, though too much of it comes at the hands of her hero.  Nick's hardheadedness and lack of faith in the heroine make him hard to warm up to (I laughed out loud when a villain made a comment about the hardness of Nick's skull.  It's so true) and go on far too long.  But it's impossible not to root for a heroine who finds herself in the nightmare Laura faces.  Chased by a killer no one believes exists, trying to find a child no one believes she had, Laura's struggles make this a thriller in the best sense of the word.  This is a truly frightening scenario, and any reader who puts herself in Laura's shoes will be anxiously turning pages to find out what happens next.  Best of all, Laura doesn't whine and she doesn't give in.  She keeps fighting.  Anyone who wants to read about a great heroine, here's a book for you.  In 220 pages, Webb delivers a better thriller than most mainstreams I've read, with enough suspense and emotion to lift this book above its cliched plot hook.<br /><br />For the first 220 pages of this book, I was sure I had a five star read on my hands.  It's the ending that disappoints.  The wonderful tension of the first twelve chapters vanishes, and the final two chapters sputter along after the story should have  reached its natural conclusion.  The delay of the happy ending is unnecessary and annoying.  One final suspense-free action sequence and a drawn-out emotional climax are not what this book needs.  The wonderful beginning and middle needed a great finish.  Sadly, \\"The Bodyguard's Baby\\" doesn't have one.  By the end, I just wanted the book to be over before I got more irritated.<br /><br />On a side note, I really wish the Intrigue editors could space out books that are so similar.  This is the second January Intrigue to involve a woman being made to look insane, with Harper Allen's \\"Woman Most Wanted.\\"  (For the record, Allen's is more original, humorous and wonderfully surprising, Webb's more suspenseful and scary.)  Both are excellent books.  Did we have to have them in the same month?  (\\"The Bodyguard's Baby\\" also has a lot in common with Adrianne Lee's \\"Little Boy Lost\\" from five months ago, right down to the secret baby, people trying to make her look crazy, and some of the revelations.  At least five months separate the two.)  Why release such similar stories so close together?<br /><br />Despite the ending, \\"The Bodyguard's Baby\\" is a strong enough book I have no trouble recommending it.  The suspense is wonderful, the romance steamy and the heroine terrific.  I'm giving it four and a half stars.  Too bad it was so close to five.	2001-01-11

His first love, Officer Molly Sparling, is the only one who can find him.  Can she bring him in before the killers on his tail catch up to him?<br />\\"Tall, Dark and Wanted\\" is a book for those who love emotional, action-packed romantic suspense.  I liked how it was the heroine who was the police officer, not the hero, a nice twist on the expected.  Mitch is also not a cowboy, despite what the cover art makes it look like (he's an architect), and Molly isn't a weak, vulnerable heroine.  She's a strong, capable woman who can take care of herself.  That doesn't mean Mitch is weak either.  He's smart and tough-minded, and he and Molly make a great pair.  <br />Although the solution to the mystery is obvious and the villain's identity clear, Hayes provides good action sequences and exciting moments to keep readers engaged.  The dangerous moments the characters find themselves in are some of the best of the book.  The beginning of the story is also slow, burdened with too much narrative and back story that slows down the plot.  The payoff is worth it though.  Mitch and Molly's relationship is defined and explored well.  It's not hard for us to think they are meant to be together.  <br />\\"Tall, Dark and Wanted\\" is an excellent romantic suspense novel and an entertaining read I thoroughly enjoyed.	2001-01-02

She is also being stalked by an unknown villain. Can this surprise father protect his unborn child and the woman he's afraid to love?<br /><br />The Sutton Babies began with the shallow but exciting \\"Cradle Will Rock,\\" improved with \\"Little Boys Blue\\" and stumbles badly in its final installment with \\"Lullaby and Goodnight.\\" There are so many things wrong with this story I can't possibly name them all. The biggest flaws include a man who sleeps with a woman and refuses to call her for nine months, then has the gall to be angry with her that he wasn't told about the baby. What a hero! Kearney already wrote a secret child story in the first Sutton book, \\"Cradle Will Rock.\\" As I said with Joanna Wayne's Randolph series, aren't two secret babies in one family too hard to believe? (On the plus side, the child is used more effectively than in \\"Cradle Will Rock,\\" and the characters' reactions are more realistic, if not heroic.) Add a heroine who makes one of the dumbest decisions I've ever read near the end of this book. Any respect I had for the character disappeared. Worse, this entire section of the story is unnecessary. The next to last chapter (not counting the epilogue) is useless, dragging out the plot for no reason, when the author should have used that space to expand her climax. The end of this book is ludicrous, wrapping up the entire three-book storyline in a page and a half. It's not suspenseful, it's not believable, and then the book's over! When I turned the last page, I thought, \\"That's it?!?\\" The abrupt ending is a ripoff for anyone who took the time to read about these characters over three books.<br /><br />The solution that explains everything that happened in the three books makes little sense. We found out in book one that someone wanted to destroy the Sutton family. Now that I know why, I have to say, the villain could not have chosen less effective methods. Why did the villain create these convoluted schemes in the other books when there were easier ways to go about ruining the family? You won't get the answer here.  I think the only answer is because Kearney likes writing convoluted plots. It made no sense. One question out of the many I had when I finished: Why did the villain stalk Rhianna instead of attacking or kidnapping her outright? Why was Cameron's wife killed in Book Two instead of trying to kill Cameron? Why try to kill the eldest Sutton brother in the first book and then forget about him after that? The series does not hold together. The ending not only made this book look worse than it already did. It made the other two look weaker than they were.<br /><br />The beginning is also awkward and confusing. It's hard to figure out where we are in the time line for the first two chapters. The action throughout is all over the map in a plot that lacks focus. The romance is nonexistent. Rhianna loves Rafe from page one and spends the next 250 waiting for him to tell her. The \\"romance\\" consists of Rafe thinking \\"I can't tell her I love her, I can't tell her I love her, I can't tell her I love her....the book's almost over. OK, I love her.\\" (That is not a spoiler. This is a romance novel. What else could he say in the end?) Rafe and Rhianna have no depth. Compare them with the characters from book two, \\"Little Boys Blue,\\" two well-developed characters with strong rooting interest.  What do we know about Rafe and Rhianna in the end of \\"Lullaby and Goodnight?\\" Next to nothing.<br /><br />This is only the second one-star review I have given in two years. I know I'll still be slammed for \\"ulterior motives\\" or \\"grinding axes.\\" I'm sorry. The year 2000 brought Intrigue titles like \\"Twice Tempted,\\" \\"Midnight Remembered,\\" \\"Texas Midnight,\\" and a wonderful secret child story in \\"Never Too Late.\\" Those were five star books, stories with depth, stories that made sense.  To give this one four, three, even two stars seems like a stretch, would be an insult to those authors and those books. No one who's read those books or some of the other great Intrigue titles this year could think this one is anywhere near as good.  \\"Lullaby and Goodnight\\" was a huge disappointment.	2000-12-26
US	50735506	R1N910CQUV1TT1	0373225814	86681614	The Bodyguard's Assignment (Texas Confidential, Book 1) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #581)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	The Bodyguard's Assignment	Amanda Stevens kicks off the Texas Confidential miniseries with \\"The Bodyguard's Assignment.\\"  Reporter Grace Drummond is on to the scoop of her life when she witnesses a murder.  All she wants is to get herself and her mother into hiding.  The only thing stopping her is Texas Confidential agent Brady Morgan.  They were once in love, until Grace betrayed him.  With so much on the line, can she trust him not to betray her?<br /><br />In my reviews of her \\"Gallagher Justice\\" series earlier this year, I said that the books were rich in story and characters while not quite as page-turning as her other books.  \\"The Bodyguard's Assignment\\" has the opposite problem.  This is a very fast paced tale.  It is also the most shallow book I've ever read from Stevens.  It's all action and light on the characters and story.  The plot is almost nonexistent.  They think they're safe, a sudden threat proves the villains have caught up with them, and they run.  Repeat that about ten times and you have the story.  There are no plot twists, not even any real plot developments.  Safety, surprise, more running.  That's it.  In those quiet moments they share stories about their pasts, which accounts for some development of the romantic angle.  There is no development of the intrigue element.  The characters make no real attempt to solve it, more eager to banter about their relationship when they're not running.  The romance receives some attention.  The mystery is barely there.<br /><br />\\"The Bodyguard's Assignment\\" also falls short as the first book of this miniseries.  The Texas Confidential agency is barely defined and the other agents blur together.  The secretary made more of an impact than any of the agents.  I was also unsatisfied with the ending.  The details of the conclusion and the happy ending open up some unanswered questions and some issues that aren't entirely credible.<br /><br />I can't say this is a bad book because it held my attention throughout.  I've also read all ofStevens' books except for a couple of Intimate Moments and this is the most unsatisfied I've been in one of them in years.  It was enjoyable but I wanted a meatier story with more depth.  I once compared one of Stevens' books to a roller coaster ride.  \\"The Bodyguard's Assignment\\" is the ultimate roller coaster ride.  It's exciting while it lasts but the effect doesn't last long once it's over.  A fun, but instantly forgettable story.	2000-12-26
US	50735506	R3PJ6X5RA2RRMO	0373225954	540748025	To Die For (Harlequin Intrigue, Book 595)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	To Die For (Version 2.0)	Sharon Green returns to Intrigue after a seven year absence with the line's second \\"To Die For.\\"  When Tanda Grail's brother is murdered, he's only the first victim of a serial killer who murders five victims in a week.  Tanda hires a private investigator to work on the case when the police get nowhere, only to see the P.I. become the killer's latest victim.  Lieutenant Mike Gerard has been assigned to the case.  As the bodies continue to pile up, can they hope to unmask the killer before it's too late?<br /><br />I changed my mind about this book's rating several times while reading it, from three stars to four to five to four and finally back to five.  \\"To Die For\\" left me too stunned and excited not to give it the highest rating I can.  It's not flawless (more on that later), but it packs a wallop most Intrigues these days can't come close to delivering.  Green delivers a mystery of such complexity and stunning twists most Intrigue authors today could never dream of inventing.  It's so daring I kept checking the cover to make sure this WAS an Intrigue.  The back cover even goes so far as to try to make this sound like another generic cop story.  It's not.  This is a wonderfully original read.<br /><br />\\"To Die For\\" is a book that will satisfy readers more interested in the \\"suspense\\" portion than the \\"romance.\\"  Those who prefer the love story to be the priority in their romantic suspense will likely be disappointed.  The romance in \\"To Die For\\" is forced and unconvincing; the character development nonexistent.  But the mystery is thrilling.  It reminded me so much of the Intrigues that used to be published back when Green started writing for the line (The love story often got the short end then too.  To Green's credit this one is more credible than the one she delivered in \\"Haunted House.\\")<br /><br />The first hundred pages are rather slow, full of setup that comes in useful later but isn't terribly compelling when presented.  It's around page 100 that the book takes off and never stops.  The mystery begins twisting and turning, with a scenario so unique and fresh I found myself grinning gleefully as I read.  This was when I started to believe I had a five star book on my hands, an impression only diminished when the forced \\"romance\\" made an appearance before thankfully handing the rest of the story over to the mystery.  This is simply the best mystery an Intrigue book has told since \\"Same Place, Same Time\\" a year ago, so well constructed and expertly plotted.  It was a pleasure to be in the hands of a writer who wasn't telling her story because this type of book is supposedly popular (i.e. babies/cowboys/amnesia victims), but one who had a special vision all her own for this tale.  So much about this story is just so wonderfully different.  The heroine's occupation, which is used to wonderful effect.  The richness of the details (although the Connecticut setting is so vague the story could have taken place anywhere.  A shame.  When was the last time a Harlequin novel took place in Connecticut???)  The mystery also brings out the best in the characters.  Through most of the beginning, they seem pretty cardboard.  Though they don't exactly pop into three-dimensions later on, their actions in dealing with the mystery as the story goes along make them easy to root for (LOVED Tanda's comeback starting on page 172.  Brilliant.)  Romance readers may (justifiably) have quibbles.  This book is a mystery reader's dream.<br /><br />I do find it ironic though that a book that brings back an old author and comes closest to the spirit of what this series used to be also shows the current Harlequin regime's lack of regard for this line's history.  The title \\"To Die For\\" was already used for an Intrigue, Number 214 by M.J. Rodgers, a book even more imaginative and full of twists than this one (It also had an actual romance).  In a battle of the two \\"To Die For\\"s, the first is still the best, though both are must-reads.<br />Books likethis are why I continue to read Harlequin Intrigues month after month, enduring recycled plots, uninspired writing and unimaginative stories in hopes that I'll find a book that knocks me off my feet.  In \\"To Die For\\" (Version 2), I found one.	2000-12-13
US	50735506	R13B3MCQ7YFP6J	037322592X	932910211	Alias Mommy (Secret Identity) (Intrigue, 592)	Books	2	0	3	N	N	Alias Mommy	Three years ago, Harlequin Intrigue's Hidden Identity series brought us Adrianne Lee's \\"Alias Daddy.\\"  Now Intrigue's Secret Identity series brings us Linda O. Johnston's \\"Alias Mommy.\\"  The only difference is how inferior this book is to that one.  The pregnant heroine, Polly Black, runs off the road in a storm and is saved by Dr. Reeve Snyder.  Reeve delivers her baby and can't help but notice the young mother's fear.  Can Polly hope the young doctor can protect her from the danger she's fleeing?<br /><br />I can't say I disliked \\"Alias Mommy.\\"  I've also given three stars to books which were better written and which I enjoyed more, so I can't give this one more than two.  There were so many problems with the story that I can't even call it acceptable.  Like most books built around a plot hook, the gimmick, the baby, isn't integrated into the story and comes off as unnecessary.  Polly's motherhood serves no purpose in this tale.  It could have been left out and it would have changed nothing.  Polly could have been a regular woman on the run.  She drives off the road, the doctor saves her, the story continues unaltered.  Other than the forced climax, nothing would have had to change.  The baby has no point in this story.  Why is it even here?<br /><br />It was annoying enough to see a book sold on a hook that is insignificant in its pages.  Then I realized the HERO was unnecessary to the story.  Reeve is barely developed past a tragic back story that is pushed too hard and then discarded too soon once it's finally explained.  He has no personality and no distinguishing characteristics.  The two-dimensional secondary characters are as fleshed out as Reeve.  Less than a quarter of the story is told in his point of view and nearly all of that is him reacting to other people's actions.  He seldom takes any action of his own and what he does is inconsequential.  Except for the minor bit about calling other doctors, one part in Chapter Fourteen and his role in the ending, Reeve could have been taken out of the story too and nothing would have changed.  A plot hook that isn't integrated well is a minor problem.  A hero who plays almost no role in the story is a big one.  Polly is only slightly better, and only because we see so much of the story through her eyes.<br /><br />If the hero is underdeveloped, the romance is nonexistent.  I must have missed the falling-in-love part; I guess it took place in all those lunches Reeve and Polly have that aren't shown.  They move from not trusting each other to having sex with no transition.  After that it is taken for granted that they are in love.  The romance disappears and except for when they were having sex I honestly couldn't tell the difference in the way they acted toward one another before the consummation and after.<br /><br />There are also problems in the storytelling.  Johnston repeats the same notes too many times.  Reeve asks Polly not to run.  She can't make him any promises.  That one has to be repeated at least ten times.  The scene where Polly listens to a news report about her and gets scared is repeated so often it starts to seem ridiculous.  Johnston also explains what happened to Polly early on in the narrative, which sucks the impact out of the moment where Polly finally explains it all to Reeve later.  She has to have Polly tell Reeve later.  Why not wait to tell us then too?  The revelation scene falls flat and lacks any drama because we know all of this.  It's just repetitious.  \\"Alias Mommy\\" is also hindered by a lack of mystery.  Books where the killers are known from the start can work, but not like this.  Like \\"Hers to Remember\\" earlier this year, this is a book where we are left waiting for the villains to show up.  Every reader knows what part of the story this will happen in (the beginning?  The middle?  The end?) and though the author offers more than that earlier book did to hold up the sagging middle it still drags.  The story is predictable, with too little done to change that.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a good read should check out \\"Alias Daddy.\\"  \\"Alias Mommy\\" is not worth the time.	2000-11-29
US	50735506	RUOCF02XF98JC	0373225903	891537145	Little Boys Blue (The Sutton Babies)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Little Boys Blue	Susan Kearney continues her Sutton Babies trilogy with \\"Little Boys Blue.\\"  After the murder of his wife, Cameron Sutton moves his twin sons back to his hometown in Colorado.  The family's new life is interrupted when his rich in-laws sue him for custody of the boys.  His wife's cousin Alexa comes to help him fight for his sons.  When danger strikes, putting Alexa and the children at risk, can Cameron find who's targeted them before it's too late?<br /><br />\\"Little Boys Blue\\" is an improvement on Book One, \\"Cradle Will Rock,\\" and Kearney's best book in years.  An energetic tale full of action, the author throws her characters in one dangerous situation after another.  This is a page-turner readers will have to try hard to put down.  Best of all is the care given to the characters.  Cameron and Alexa's romance is well-done.  They have palpable chemistry and depth of emotions.  Alexa is given a compelling back story that adds to her character, and the boys are adorable, naughty without being bratty.  The characters from the last book are also used well.  Like book one, \\"Little Boys Blue\\" uses a plot hook.  I won't mention what it is, since it comes so far into the story that it seems like a spoiler to have the back cover copy spell it out.  Unlike book one, it's well integrated and feels necessary to this tightly written story.<br /><br />Although the villain's identity is fairly easy to guess, the suspense is kept high.  My only real concern is that this book doesn't continue the storyline started in \\"Cradle Will Rock.\\"  That book  indicated there was a larger plot targeting the entire family.  This is not mentioned at all in \\"Little Boys Blue,\\" which seems to have dropped the whole element.  It's not a major issue.  It does make me wonder where the series is going.  That could be a good thing.<br /><br />\\"Little Boys Blue\\" is a entertaining read that should please fans of \\"breathtaking romantic suspense.\\"	2000-11-29
US	50735506	R1BGXTJECM46HJ	0373225865	139044634	Cradle Will Rock (The Sutton Babies, Book 1) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #586)	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Cradle Will Rock	Susan Kearney begins a new trilogy called The Sutton Babies in \\"Cradle Will Rock,\\" a book that really has nothing to do with babies.  Two years ago Laura Embry ran from Colorado, believing she'd killed the brother of the man she loved, Chase Sutton.  Now Chase has found her.  He wants her to go back to Colorado to face her crime.  When new danger surfaces, can Laura keep her child and the man she loves safe from harm?<br /><br />If that summary sounds vague, it's because I don't want to ruin any of the plot twists of Kearney's story.  They're the best part of an otherwise unconvincing book.  Of course we know there will be more to the case than it first appears, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a story here.  \\"Cradle Will Rock\\" is a very fast and energetic tale that might remind some of Kelsey Roberts and Amanda Stevens' books.  It's a fast, fun book.  It's also one with far too many narrative excesses and unlikely elements that keep it out of the realm of believability.  Too often Kearney's characters don't behave like real people would in the same circumstances.  Their reactions seem false.  For instance, Chase has learned Laura was pregnant when she disappeared.  For all he knows, he was the only man she's slept with.  But when he finds her living with a child who looks just like him, he never asks her if it's his.  He doesn't say a word about it.  It is not believable at all.<br /><br />The most objectionable part of the book is the manipulative title.  The series is called \\"The Sutton Babies.\\"  The book is called \\"Cradle Will Rock.\\"  The story has nothing to do with babies!  Books like this are why I object to the secret child plot.  The baby has no impact on this story.  Chase could have found Laura childless and the story would have remained exactly the same.  It's clear the child is here for no reason but to offer the book its much needed plot hook, not to add anything to the story.  The only purpose he serves is his predictable role in the climax, the burden of secret children in romantic suspense novels everywhere.  From what I've read from other people, the appeal of this plot is seeing a couple fall in love and find forgiveness over such a deception.  \\"Cradle Will Rock\\" doesn't even have that.  As far as I could tell, Chase and Laura are back in love from the beginning.  There is no developing love story and no real growth in their relationship over the course of the book.<br /><br />With no romance, the appeal of \\"Cradle Will Rock\\" is limited to its action, which is entertaining until the plot contrivances go too far.  I had a little too much fun reading \\"Cradle Will Rock\\" to give it a negative review.  I also rolled my eyes too often to give it a positive one.  \\"Cradle Will Rock\\" is a fun book.  It's also pretty shallow and annoying.	2000-11-20

In the middle of a dangerous mission, CIA agent Joshua Stone made love to his partner, Paige Daniels.  The next morning he and the top secret toxin they were sent to recover were gone.  Three years later, a man matching his description has been found.  Paige knows the man known as Jack Thompson is Josh.  Can she unlock the secrets in his mind and hope he can remember her too?<br /><br />The \\"Men of Mystery\\" series ends with a book that finally ranks with the first two, \\"The Bride's Protector\\" and \\"The Stranger She Knew,\\" as truly dazzling.  Books like this are why I have no problem saying that others aren't as good.  Saying that \\"Her Private Bodyguard\\" or \\"Renegade Heart\\" are on the same level as \\"Midnight Remembered\\" only diminishes this remarkable achievement.  Those books were nowhere near as good.  Few books are.  Wilson has won plenty of acclaim.  This is truly one of her best.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Remembered\\" is one of those special stories that delivers it all.  Mind-boggling twists and heart stopping suspense.  Compelling mystery and emotional romance.  The book is a feat of plotting, keeping both the romance and suspense at a consistently high level throughout the book, something I wish Wilson would remember for all of her books.  The characters are developed over the course of the story as they try to understand the strange circumstances they find themselves in, not by sitting around arguing with each other or through pages of narration.  The main idea behind the story isn't a new one (I've about given up on finding those)--Rebecca York's classic \\"Talons of the Falcon\\" is built on a similar idea and Wilson herself has used variations on the theme.  But this is a story like no other you've read.  The way Wilson tells her story makes it feel new and fresh, her characters are complex originals and the international aspect adds unique flavor.  (Two of the best Intrigues I've read this year have stories that go beyond the United States.  I don't think it's a coincidence.)  The best stories in this series have taken advantage of the wealth of possibilities the CIA aspect opens up, and the story here feels frighteningly real, even with name like Vladistan, so phony it's cheesy.<br /><br />The romance is strong and beautiful.  Josh and Paige's love story is very emotional, one readers will cherish.  The climax is one of those heart-pounding situations where you won't be able to figure out how they'll get out of it.  The amnesia element doesn't feel like a worn-out plot hook.  It is a vital element used for maximum impact.  The mystery is unique, not a situation of who-did-it, but what's happening.  I could write pages on how great this story is.  All you need to know is that it's a stunner.<br /><br />I don't give five star reviews to too many books.  I think they should mean something and go to books that are truly special.  This one is.  \\"Midnight Remembered\\" is one of the top three Intrigues I've read this year and I've read them all.  If you thought the last two books were great, you haven't seen anything yet.	2000-11-10
US	50735506	R1CAPC8UNN1CBM	0373225857	282246191	The Agent's Secret Child (Texas Confidential, Book 2) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #585)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	The Agent's Secret Child	BJ Daniels continues the Texas Confidential series with this month's first secret child book and amnesia story in \\"The Agent's Secret Child.\\"  Six years after the woman he loved died in a fiery explosion, agent Jake Cantrell receives a call from a five year old child, a child who calls him father.  Her mother bears a striking resemblance to Abby Diaz, the love of his life.  She claims to have no memory of her life before the last six years.  Could she be Abby, and can he keep her and her daughter safe from the drug lord who wants them dead?<br /><br />The title and the expected happy ending shouldn't make it too hard to answer those questions.  \\"The Agent's Secret Child\\" is told with enough energy and emotion to make it an exciting and refreshing read.  Though the circumstances of Jake not knowing about his daughter are contrived, they were at least unique and didn't turn me against one of the characters.  Anyone who is tired of secret child books, and I've complained enough about them, should know this is the first in a while that didn't aggravate me.  Daniels makes Abby's slow discovery of her identity quite poignant.  Jake and Abby's relationship is full of passion.  This is a romance many readers will cheer for.  The action never stops moving, and the equally strong hero and heroine prove their strength more than once.  The mystery is well done, with juicy secrets to be uncovered and some nice investigating on the part of the heroine.  The climax was slightly familiar (see last year's \\"My Lover's Secret,\\" Intrigue 528) and one final twist so obvious it only made one of our heroes look stupid.  Honestly, how else could it have turned out?  The romance and suspense are still both consistently high and strong enough to make this one a winner.<br /><br />This book could easily have been five stars (right now it's a solid four and a half) if it had been longer.  (Unless you're interested in a really nitpicky point, stop reading now and go buy the book).  This isn't only a book where readers will say they wished it was longer.  It needed to be.  \\"The Agent's Secret Child\\" is 233 pages, fifteen less than the average Intrigue, with huge margins and big type.  (Temptation length.  Why isn't it Temptation priced?)  There isn't any place where the emotions or details couldn't have been expanded upon for greater effect.  The Texas Confidential agency especially could use more detail.  Two books into the series and the agency is still vaguely defined.  Too many of the agency characters and background details are offered in quick one line descriptions that read like this is how her editor or the other authors described them to her.  They aren't her characters, so Daniels has no idea who they are and isn't going to bother with them any more than she has to.  For instance, the author keeps mentioning another agent who disappeared a year ago.  This probably will come into play later in the series, but Jake thinks about this so casually and unemotionally that it seems to have no impact on him or his coworkers.  It's only going to make it less effective if this plot point comes up in the future, and makes me wonder why Jake would bother thinking about it if he cares so little.  It's a very minor point but a crucial one.  It says \\"Texas Confidential\\" isn't holding up well as a series.  (All the ads say these agents are cowboys by day.  We have yet to see them do anything cowboy-related.)  It's not like Daniels doesn't have room to add more detail.  The book could have been expanded, and should have been.<br /><br />I have no problem recommending \\"The Agent's Secret Child\\" highly.  The central relationship and suspense are wonderful.  Only the foundation the book and the series are set up on are too fuzzy around the edges.  For top notch romantic suspense, this is still one book that should not be missed.	2000-10-23

Let's leave it at this:  Taryn Scott's job is to find people.  One night she is hired by attorney Nick Travis to find a man who has been missing for a year.  The case seems clear cut, until Taryn finds herself in danger and naturally the mysterious Nick is not what he seems.<br /><br />I began \\"Her Mysterious Stranger\\" with hope.  There were no obvious hooks and the story sounded fresh.  I should have known better.  The familiar plot elements take a while to make their presence felt but they're there.  The basis of this story and the ultimate revelations are all standard and predictable.  The entire story hinges on a plot twist that would be more effective were it not foreseeable from a mile away.  Not only was the exact same twist used just as obviously in an Intrigue from the old \\"Hidden Identity\\" promotion a couple of years ago, but there really is only one twist that could make this story interesting.  Such inevitability ensures that it isn't.<br /><br />The first half of this story is deadly dull; the second half a mix of unconvincing romance, eye-roller plot twists and uninvolving action.  The first part isn't boring because nothing is happening  (Although an entire chapter is dedicated to Taryn and Nick sitting in a bowling alley having an impromptu date.  I nearly fell asleep.).  Taryn does standard detective work on the case, so things ARE happening.  It is boring because Taryn and Nick don't seem to have anything at stake in what's happening.  Nearly all Intrigues revolve around crimes and mysteries in which the hero and heroine have a personal interest.  That is vital to making the story emotionally compelling.  Here Taryn's investigation is dull because there is nothing to give the mystery an emotional element.  The people who knew the missing man all act suspicious.  Why should we care?  Things do improve when Taryn's meddling finally puts her at risk, but the personal element comes too late to salvage the story.  Everything that follows is too predictable and cliched, though I can't say why without \\"ruining\\" it.  I will say this.  The revelations open a giant plot hole that is never clearly resolved and only ensures the story doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Recent attempts by American Romance writers to pen Intrigues have been mixed, from the fantastic (\\"When Night Draws Near\\") to the average (\\"Little Girl Found\\") to the subpar (\\"A Man of Honor\\").  This is the weakest yet.  Unless you haven't read much romantic suspense and are surprised easily, I'd skip this one.	2000-10-23

An escaped killer has put his last victim, Casey Maynard, back on alert.  Scarred emotionally and physically, Casey has hidden from the world at her family estate.  She doesn't trust anyone she doesn't know.  That includes Mitch Taylor, the cop who's been assigned to protect her.  Their attraction is immediate.  With a clever killer moving in, can Casey trust Mitch with her life and her heart?<br /><br />Creativity and originality have been in short supply in this year's Intrigues.  Too often, books have been too similar too ones that came out not long before.  Amanda Stevens' \\"The Littlest Witness\\" was followed by Leona Karr's \\"Innocent Witness.\\"  The final book in Joanna Wayne's Family Ties series was much like the first book.  Man pretends amnesiac is his wife in \\"A Night Without End.\\"  Man pretends amnesiac is his wife in \\"Love at First Sight\\" a month later.  This does have more to do with the editors not telling their authors they already have a similar story in the works than the authors themselves, but for readers, the similarities are hard to miss.  In this case, \\"One Good Man\\" is very similar to Gayle Wilson's \\"Her Private Bodyguard,\\" which came out six months ago.  A woman with a severe leg injury that causes her to limp has shut herself away from the world.  When she finds herself in danger, she is saddled with a bodyguard she doesn't want, who is scornful of rich women like her.  A key emotional scene involves the heroine dancing in her hero's arms for the first time.  I'm not saying Miller knew about the other book.  I am saying this is a bit much to take so soon.<br /><br />On a positive note, \\"One Good Man\\" is a better book than \\"Her Private Bodyguard.\\"  The romance and suspense are balanced better and the heroine is more sympathetic.  Though it is also well-written, \\"One Good Man\\" fails to rise above a routine stalker story because Miller uses too many cliches.  The killer is a master of disguise (aren't they all?), a device so tired most mainstream thrillers are starting to have the good sense not to use it anymore.  If he's as good as described, why hasn't he moved on to more impressive crimes than the petty ones he is first attributed with?  Mitch himself is a huge cliché.  He's a working class cop who was once married to a woman from a wealthy family who cheated on him because he couldn't give her the life she wanted.  Now he's bitter and resentful to all rich women.  Have we heard that one before?  That is about as obvious as Casey being rich, causing the expected friction.<br /><br />Even if I didn't know the man was nothing but an irritating \\"type,\\"  I wouldn't have liked him.  Mitch's prejudices make him hard to warm up to and the condescending way he calls Casey \\"Princess\\" annoyed me throughout.  Worse than a cliché, he's not a sympathetic one.  Miller offers several fascinating facts about her characters, then fails to explore any of them.  Casey's past as an Olympic swimmer and the loss caused by her attack are hardly developed, and the fact that Mitch took back his wife and cared for her when she was dying is intriguing, but never delved into at any length. Miller tells us things about her characters.  In the end they feel more like a collection of facts than real people.<br /><br />\\"One Good Man\\" is also a story with no surprises.  The villains are practically announced with neon letters, acting so suspicious it is impossible to miss how guilty they are.  The story is generally well told, but the story is predictable and the clues obvious.  Miller is never able to work up a consistent level of suspense despite some good atmosphere and moments.  It never drags, but it's not a page-turner.  \\"One Good Man\\" is an acceptable story.  The familiar story and characters ensure it is not more than one.re it is not more than one.	2000-10-16
US	50735506	RMN7SPSUGX84A	0373225830	683817513	Safe by His Side (The Colby Agency, Book 1) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #583)	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Safe By His Side	New Intrigue author Debra Webb continues the \\"Secret Identity\\" series while starting her own in \\"Safe By His Side.\\" It's a good sign of things to  come.  The author pens convincing action sequences and keeps the romance  steamy.  The love scenes are hotter than usual for Intrigues and the sexual  tension consistently high.  Her villains are also appropriately chilling  (One irritating point: With the language toned down for series romances,  it's better if some curses are avoided altogether.  It's obvious \\"crap\\"  would not be the villains' swear word of choice and it just sounds  strange.)  Altogether, \\"Safe By His Side\\" is a solid tale full of danger  and desire.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  If I was unable to muster more  enthusiasm for the book, it was because there is little here we haven't  seen before.  The increasingly common secret agent hero.  The amnesia,  which seems particularly contrived coming when it does here.  (So far, the  \\"Secret Identity\\" series seems to be nothing more than a continuation of  the \\"A Memory Away\\" promotion under a different title.)  The heroes are on  the run in the type of story Gayle Wilson and Rebecca York have told  better.  The comparison isn't a fair one to make with a new author, but it  does go to show Webb is in good company.  As solid as it was...well, that  is what it was.  Not unique or inspired in any way.  A solid reuse of  familiar elements in a story that comes across like one we've seen before.  Webb has done an admirable job absorbing the hooks the editors love, but  she doesn't do much to make them seem fresh and new this time around.<br /><br />I also never really warmed up to the heroine.  For much of the first half,  Kate is very childish.  A grown woman who stomps her feet, sticks her  tongue out and never stops complaining doesn't earn high points for  maturity with me.  The ending also falls a bit flat.  Part of the plot  involves Raine finding out who inside the government blew his cover.  We'regiven two suspects (savvy readers can likely guess who it is early on), but  we're never introduced to either character, never get a chance to meet  either of them over the course of the book, so we have nothing invested in  either of them turning out to be the traitor.  In the end we find out which  one it was but it could have gone the other way and it wouldn't have made  any difference in terms of impact.<br /><br />Despite those quibbles, \\"Safe By His  Side\\" is a well-told tale sure to be enjoyed by those who haven't had their  fill of stories like this and perhaps some who have.  Webb is an author to  look for.  A more original tale will likely make better use of her talent.	2000-09-20

That is hard enough for Annie to deal with.  The arrival of her first love,  the man who walked out of her life without a word, is worse.  Michael Slade  vows to protect Annie and her grandfather.  But what secrets is Michael  keeping from her, and can she trust him to stay this time when she needs  him most?<br /><br />\\"Undercover Protector\\" isn't the best book from this author or the line but I did enjoy it the most out of this month's Intrigues.  Miles  has a strong voice and a pleasing storytelling style that will pull readers through from beginning to end.  While there are a few rough spots in the  story, I never lost interest for a moment.  Although one big  misunderstanding is foreseeable a mile away, it fortunately doesn't derail  the plot like it could have.  Annie and Michael's romance develops nicely,  and the small town flavor is a nice added touch.  Unfortunately, the title  is a bit of a spoiler, since we don't find out the undercover aspect of  Michael's mission until near the end.  I still enjoyed \\"Undercover  Protector.\\"  Fans of her \\"Captive Hearts\\" books last year won't want to  miss it.	2000-09-20

We learned in book three that Ryder  Randolph is the father of the mystery baby who was dropped on the Randolph  family doorstep.  Now the mother is back, running from killers and trying  to save Ryder from a murder rap she knows he isn't guilty of.  Ryder can't  understand this woman who abandoned him and their child.  That can't stop him from wanting her.  Can he save them both and dare to find a future for them?<br /><br />\\"A Mother's Secrets\\" is an acceptable read, though a letdown after  the other books in the series.  It took me a while to write this review  because I couldn't quite figure out why I didn't like this book more than I  did.  Then I figured it out.  A pregnant young woman chased by danger runs  from the man she loves.  She later hatches a plan to leave her child with  the father while she faces the risk on her own.  The man no longer trusts  her, and his brother Branson, the town sheriff, treats her with suspicion  and disrespect.  The hero finally understands the danger she's in, decides  he has to trust her, and works with her to save her.  That's the basic plot  of \\"A Mother's Secrets,\\" but it's also the basic outline of the first  Randolph book, \\"Family Ties.\\"  The specific details are different, but this  book still seems very familiar.  It's annoying enough to see an author  reuse plot elements.  I had a hard time believing that such a similar set  of events would happen twice in the same family.  Both of Mary Randolph's  grandchildren were secret babies born in the circumstances explained above.  Isn't that a bit much for one family?<br /><br />I was also bothered by the  heroine.  The heroine of the last book, \\"The Stranger Next Door,\\" never  really came to life for me, but it was okay because she had amnesia.  She  didn't know who she was, so it was understandable that I didn't either.  Kathi had her memory, and I felt I knew her even less than I did Danielle.  Perhaps it's because she only does one thing in this book:  cry and say she  has to go on the run again.  We learn almost nothing about her family or  who she is as a person; all I knew by the end was that she wanted to run.  It wasn't enough for me to form any attachment.  What are her likes and dislikes?  We never know.<br /><br />I was also bothered by the characters'  inability to ask necessary questions until long after they should have been  voiced.  When Branson (back in jerk mode after a brief reprieve in his own  story) finally questions Kathi, he neglects to ask some very obvious  questions about her story that any logical person should have wanted to  know.  In the end the author does wrap up all the loose ends that nagged me  all through the book.  It still took too long to satisfy me.<br /><br />I know there  are those who will disagree with me.  The Romantic Times made this book a Top Pick.  Then again, they also gave a mediocre rating to the original  \\"Family Ties,\\" a book I still think is Wayne's best.  \\"A Mother's Secrets\\"  is a must-read for those who have been following the Randolph saga.  But if  the original \\"Family Ties\\" was the best book and \\"The Second Son\\" was the second best, for me \\"A Mother's Secrets\\" definitely comes in a distant fourth out of four.	2000-09-15

Carleen Ellison wakes in a motel room to find her  son and her identity have been stolen from her.  An impostor claiming to be  her has taken over her life.  The only person who might believe she is  herself is Kane Kincaid, her son's secret father.  Kane and Carleen's love  has never died.  Will it be enough to regain Carleen's identity and their  son?<br /><br />\\"Little Boy Lost\\" is Lee's most suspenseful book to date.  The story places the heroine in a terrifying situation we can't help but  sympathize with and sends her on the run with the hero of her dreams.  Full  of dangerous situations and hissable bad guys, it's a book where I got mad  anytime someone tried to interrupt me while I was reading.  Be sure you  have the time to read it from cover to cover before picking this one up!  Lee's unique voice keeps the story coming fast and furious, concluding with  an ending that delivers one surprise after another.  We might think we know  who the villain is, but Lee keeps the twists coming so that nothing is as  it seems.  This is also one of the few secret baby books where that element  is essential to the plot, unlike so many books where it feels like it could  be cut without changing the story.  A nice change of pace.<br /><br />\\"Little  Boy Lost\\" (no relation to Lee's \\"Little Girl Lost.\\"  Merely  an unimaginative title.) will keep readers on the edge of their seats from  start to finish.	2000-08-21
US	50735506	R3OHLVW5KFVKWO	0373225792	352967109	Inadmissible Passion	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Inadmissible Passion	Ann Voss Peterson makes a strong Intrigue debut with \\"Inadmissible Passion,\\" a gem of a first novel.  I usually wouldn't bother providing a summary when the author already has, but the back cover copy is so misleading that I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea what this book is  about. (At least once sentence is totally false, making me wonder whether  the person who wrote the copy actually read the book.)  The basic premise  is this:  Assistant District Attorney Brittany Gerritsen's best friend has  been murdered and Britt is positive she knows who the killer is. Not only is he a state congressman, but he's the brother of Jackson Alcott, her  former fiance, who broke off their engagement five years before.  Jack  doesn't believe his brother is guilty, and as the opposing attorney, he  intends to prove it.  Can Britt hope to find justice when at every turn  she's facing the man who broke her heart?<br /><br />\\"Inadmissible Passion\\" marks the return of the legal thriller genre to Intrigue after a too-long  absence. It was worth waiting for.  A fresh tale with strong characters,  it would be a good choice for romance readers looking for something new.  Like last month's \\"Blackmailed Bride\\" (a very different kind of story), it  reminded me of a time when Intrigues were more original and less hook  driven.  The passion sizzles and the mystery is well done, sure to keep  readers guessing until shortly before end.  The author has a smooth writing  style and a way with words that results in some very nice descriptions  along the way, and you can feel Jack's agony about the secret he keeps from  Britt (even if, like Britt, I thought he should have told her long before).  It's a story of separated lovers sure to touch a few hearts.<br /><br />It also proves that a book doesn't need to be action packed to be suspenseful and  compelling, one reason I object to that \\"breathtaking romantic suspense\\"  slogan.  Anyone who expects that to mean constant action sequences and characters who are always in danger (as the cover copy implies) might be  disappointed (That's the only explanation I can think of for the Romantic  Times reviewer calling the beginning \\"slow\\").  Yes, it takes a  while for the threats on Britt's life to develop but I was never bored.  The story is still packed with enough engrossing drama and puzzling mystery  to make this a real pageturner.  Most important, it's a story that never  stops moving.  Things may not be exploding and bullets flying from the  first page to the last, but the story flows smoothly and quickly from one  dramatic moment and revelation to another, with plenty of tension and  suspense (It's an ability a few veteran authors could stand to learn from  this novice.)  The characters may not have always been in danger, but I was  always in suspense wondering when the truth would come out, what would  happen next, etc.  I read it in one sitting and was highly entertained from  start to finish.<br /><br />The book's only possible weakness is the heroine, who  does some very stupid things for a supposedly intelligent woman.  Her  continued insistence that Jack's brother had to be the killer when there were a number of other people who had the same motive for killing Tangi made little sense and grew tiresome very fast.  Her fast turnaround from  trusting Jack to doubting him without even talking to him didn't speak well for her faith in their relationship, and her inability to see the truth in  the end when it was literally staring her in the face was very  frustrating.<br /><br />That one weakness is minor compared to the book's considerable strengths.  \\"Inadmissible Passion\\" is still a wonderful  mystery and strong love story from an author to watch for.  Highly  recommended.	2000-08-15

Two  years later a stranger with familiar eyes arrives on her doorstep.  Has  Dylan come home?  Is he a killer?<br /><br />McBride uses several of the same  devices she did in \\"Wed to a Stranger?\\" (Intrigue 418).  A  husband returns with a different face, a wife doesn't know whether to trust  him.  It's been done before and can work, but McBride's treatment of it  here is much less plausible.  The number of contrivances and coincidences  used to keep the story going and the characters from learning the truth is  aggravating.  I spent too much of the story thinking, \\"I'm not buying  any of this.\\"<br /><br />McBride's writing is smooth, although it does have a  lighter feel that prevents any real sense of danger from building.  It does  help carry the reader past some of the more hard to swallow aspects for a  while, until the book completely unravels in the final fifty pages.  Out of  nowhere, the heroine is convinced the hero is the killer.  The hero is  convinced he's the killer.  They whine and cry and wring their hands, and  all the reader can do is scream in frustration.  Of course, we know Dylan  isn't the killer.  (That should not be considered a spoiler.  The day a Harlequin hero turns out to be a psychopathic killer is the day Harlequin goes out of business.)  Other writers have managed to create a sense of  suspense where we really have to wonder, but it never seems possible here.  Most readers will have figured out the only possible solution long before.  It cannot be more obvious, yet the characters never seem to catch on.  This reader's patience with the story and the characters ran out long  before the climax, when one of the figures it out, conveniently, at the  last possible moment.<br /><br />Many readers will appreciate the glimpse McBride offers of Dylan and Alice's relationship before the wedding, so we can see  what they are trying to recapture.  The romance is generally well done until the characters turn into idiots.  An annoying read.	2000-08-11

But the man is dead and his widow is  shocked by Drew's claims.  Maggie Cannon understands too well why her  husband would agree to lie on the stand and agrees to help Drew prove his  innocence.  Is it because she feels she owes him, or because of the  attraction she feels for this dangerous man?<br /><br />\\"Renegade Heart\\"  is a book packed with compelling scenes and emotional moments, told in  Wilson's unique style.  The author keeps the reader nicely off balance.  Just when we think we know where a section is going, there is an unexpected  twist.  This makes for a satisfyingly suspenseful atmosphere that will keep  readers on their toes, while the sparks between the main characters will  draw them in.<br /><br />The book is being sold on the basis of its  \\"mysterious\\" hero.  For me, its strongest part was really the  heroine.  Unlike the heroine of the last Men of Mystery book, \\"Her  Private Bodyguard,\\" Maggie was someone I sympathized with and admired.  Like the best Intrigue heroines, she's not superwoman, but an ordinary one  who shows how strong she is when faced with extraordinary circumstances.  I  liked how it was Maggie who turns detective and actually does some  investigating.  Drew might be the former CIA agent, but it felt like Maggie  was his perfect equal, the way it should be.  She was the kind of woman I  could identify with and imagine what I would do in the same circumstances.  Both of the characters had hard pasts but never became too self-pitying,  even though Drew probably had good reason.  For two strong, dynamic  characters who you can actually root for while they face down danger and  fall in love, \\"Renegade Heart\\" can't be beat.<br /><br />I'm not crazy  about the title, since Drew never gets a chance to show he's much of a  renegade (\\"Fugitive Heart\\" would be more appropriate, but that  Intrigue title's already been taken.).  Under any title, strong character  development, intense scenes, and some big surprises along the way make this a book Wilson's fans won't want to miss.	2000-08-11

The story of a man and  woman united when his son turns out to be her kidnapped child, it not only  is moving, but a real pageturner when it comes to the intrigue element.  There is a lot that needs to happen to make the romance believable in a  situation like this, and Roberts pulls it off with ease. The dialogue is  great, with banter that's thankfully based on real emotion instead of  sniping and innuendo. Parts of the story are so honest and raw they're  almost painful to read, but in the end, the reading experience is much more  rewarding because we've come through it all with the characters. The rest  of the Landry brothers are introduced in subtle ways that indicate Ms.  Roberts has some interesting tales in store for us. A red hot start for a  series that finds this favorite author in top form.<br />(This is a repost of  my review from October.  I recently reread it and decided it certainly  deserved that fifth star. I haven't always enjoyed her books, but this is  one of her best. A must-read.)	2000-08-03

Now she sees him everywhere.   On the street.  Outside her apartment.  Liza is afraid she's losing her  mind.  Mike Davis has come to New Orleans to discover what happened to him  before he was found beaten half to death in a train car five years ago.   Can a feline detective bring these two together to solve the mystery of  their mutual pasts?<br />&quot;Familiar Obsession&quot; is a story whose  strongest parts come in its second half.  The first 100 pages are a bit  slow moving; it takes f..o..r...e...v...e..r for the main characters to  meet.  The hero and heroine don't have their first conversation until page  90, something sure to drive some readers nuts.  Most of the confusion of  the first 100 pages wouldn't exist if the two simply talked to each other  (as the ever-perceptive Familiar points out).  It is a lack of  communication at its most annoying.  <br />Their first meeting comes so late  that most readers won't expect a full-fledged romance.  They won't get it.   When the main characters finally reunite, they're back in love in the blink  of an eye and the mystery becomes the focus of the rest of the book.  That  isn't exactly a bad thing.  Burnes handles the mystery with her usual  expertise, as she offers a range of suspects and motives, and deftly drops  clues and information.  She also includes one of her hallmarks, a juicy  antagonist who keeps interfering with the leads' investigation at the wrong  moments.  It's always fascinating to see how the author fully integrates  Familiar in the story, when some writers can't seem to come up with enough  for two characters to do and as usual, the cat proves wiser than any of the  human characters.  The final fifty pages feature some clever plotting, good  twists and another nail-biter of an ending.  What started outas a  three-star book finished as a four for me.  Romance readers may have their  quibbles, but &quot;Familiar Obsession&quot; should delight mystery readers  and Familiar fan's alike.	2000-08-02

The  job gets to be more interesting when the beautiful Danielle arrives in  town.  Danielle has been struck with amnesia after an brutal attack in New  Orleans.  The only key to her identity is a letter from her dead uncle, who  left her his ranch neighboring the Randolphs.  Someone begins terrorizing  her in an attempt to drive her off the land.  Can the substitute sheriff  keep her safe and find the culprit?<br />In this well-told romantic suspense  tale, the author manages a nice balance between the romantic and mystery  parts of the story.  Every chapter ends with a dramatic or suspenseful  moment and in between the tension is kept high.  The mystery has a number  of suspects to keep readers trying to solve it all the way to the surprise  ending.  At the same time, there is good character development between the  leads.  The romance between Langley and Danielle is developed better than  the one in &quot;The Second Son.&quot;  This is also the first amnesia book  I've read in a while that didn't immediately annoy me, maybe because I  didn't feel like the cover copy was shoving that plot hook down my throat.   <br />The author's clean, spare writing is effective, highlighted by amusing  dialogue (&quot;I bought you a present.&quot; &quot;It's not my  birthday.&quot; &quot;It might be.&quot;)  Best of all, she sets up the  final book, &quot;A Mother's Secrets&quot; in a way where we won't be  waiting to find out who baby Betsy's father is, sparing us a drawn out  revelation in that one.  I would have to say that readers who haven't read  &quot;The Second Son&quot; should probably do that first, or else skippages 158 and 159, where Wayne explains the whole plot of that book.   Better yet, try and get your hands on a copy of &quot;Family Ties&quot; and  start at the beginning.  Either way, &quot;The Stranger Next Door&quot; is  sure to win Joanna Wayne even more fans.	2000-07-27

Tessa is pregnant with the  child of Cord's brother Hunt, an undercover agent of some sort. Cord has  always loved Tessa.  Now, with Hunt nowhere to be found, this man of honor  knows it is his duty to protect his brother's woman and child as though  they were his own.<br />It is an idea with promise. Sadly, &quot;A Man of  Honor&quot; is an unconvincing story with little real suspense. The back  cover teases what happens &quot;as danger closed in...&quot; The problem  is, the danger never does close in. The villains know where Tessa is from  Chapter One, but they never do anything about it.  If their plan is to use  her to lure Hunt into the open, why don't they ever make their move? They  have numerous opportunities to try and kidnap her, since Tessa foolishly  insists on going to work and leaving Cord's protection several times. They  never even try. The author keeps showing them sitting there, watching her.  Why don't they ever try to do anything? Maybe Tessa's unconcern with the  threat to her life and child is understandable. I sure never felt like  Tessa was in any real danger from such lazy villains.<br />Because of the low  suspense and no mystery, the book moves very slowly. Tessa bonds with the  beauty store owner. Tessa gets a puppy. Tessa's mother is mean to her.  Cord...I don't know what Cord does. Not much. He is an underdeveloped hero  whose love is established early and who spends the rest of the book waiting  for her to return it.  This man of honor is not a man of action.  And the  bad guys lurk. And lurk. And lurk. The action does not begin to move until  Chapter Thirteen. At the same time, the romance does not begin to develop  until a ways into the book either. It's mostly Cord's heart shattering,  Cord's heart breaking, repeatedly while he can't have Tessa.I was never  entirely comfortable with the idea of Cord and Tessa falling in love and  raising the baby together when his brother was still alive out there, not  knowing about the baby. The transition from Tessa pushing him away and  turning to him was not convincing.<br />Like the kidnappers who never try to  kidnap, the book is riddled with inconsistencies that show an inattention  to detail and kept me from getting into the story. On the first page, an  ice storm is &quot;gripping Crookseye Canyon.&quot; The next day, the  characters are trying to predict when the ice storm will come. Is this a  new ice storm, because it doesn't sound like it. Tessa also continues to  insist she would be safe in her own home, where the killers couldn't get  her. She owns it, so it must be in her name. Why would it be so hard to  find out where she lives? (Then again, I never was clear on how they were  able to find out where Cord lived. If Hunt is an undercover agent, it seems  unlikely he would have been using his own name in Spain. How did they  figure out where his family ranch was, or who his family was? Did they  follow Cord and Tessa back from Spain, and if so, why didn't they act seven  months ago when Cord and Tessa returned? A big hole in the plot.) At one  point, Cord insists the baby has to be born in the United States so it will  be a U.S. citizen. Since both the parents are U.S. citizens, the baby would  be too, no matter where in the world it is born. That renders Cord's  argument and the following hurried action pointless. For such a simple  plot, I had far too many questions afterward.<br />This probably makes &quot;A  Man of Honor&quot; sound horrible. The truth is, it is not a one-star book.  That is given to books I absolutely hate, which offend me with their sheer  awfulness. I didn't hate &quot;A Man of Honor.&quot; I didn't feel anything  at all. The intrigue wasn't suspenseful, the characters weren't engaging,  the romance wasn't that touching (the lovemaking scene is very well done,  though). It passed easily with no thrills and was too pleasant for romantic  suspense. It is not a bad book. It is not a good book.  If you're looking  for romantic suspense, at best you may find it is a boring one.	2000-07-24

Set in an abandoned monastery in the middle of nowhere in the dead  of winter, it is the kind of page turner sure to send a shiver up your  spine.  In a way it is reminiscent of Jenna Ryan's early books.  There are  no hooks, but several original elements, which makes it feel like a welcome  breath of fresh air.  Unlike many attempts at the modern gothic, the  characters aren't stuck as stock characters.  Cathlynn is a tough heroine  who won't back down. Jonas is remote, but wasn't one of those hard-headed  heroes who I frustrated me to the extreme.  Their interplay sizzles, the  suspense builds, the characters find themselves in danger repeatedly.   While her first Intrigue, &quot;One Texas Night&quot; was very repetitive,  Kurtz keeps the action moving and the thrills coming throughout.  I read it  in one sitting.  I couldn't put it down.<br />So I don't mislead anyone, I  will admit &quot;Blackmailed Bride&quot; is not without flaws.  Kurtz  doesn't play fair with the mystery.  It isn't too hard to figure out who  the villain is.  It is impossible to figure out why, since Kurtz withholds  quite abit of information about characters until the climax.  These are  things the characters know about each other.  Only the reader is left in  the dark.  It is a bit of a cheap trick when it's not even teased at.   There are also some melodramatic moments and some overlooked points (if  Jonas needs money so bad, how could he afford to buy the Heart out from  under Cathlynn?).  But the story is so fresh, the setting so well done, the  danger so wonderfully suspenseful, that those minor points were easy for me  to overlook. (And the melodramatic and over the top passages are still  pretty fun.)  I never lost interest for a moment and never stopped turning  the pages.  A very entertaining read I highly enjoyed.  Anyone tired of  kids and cowboys, here's one for you.  A fabulous change of pace.  Don't  miss it.	2000-07-21

Deanna turns to Dr. Steve  Sherman for help and hopes the child psychologist can break through to  Penny.  But somewhere, a killer would do anything to keep Penny from  remembering.  Could Steve keep Penny and her mother safe from a  murderer?<br />&quot;Innocent Witness&quot; is a cute story, but is  unfortunately overshadowed by Amanda Stevens' &quot;The Littlest  Witness&quot; (Intrigue 549).  That book came out a few months ago and had  a very similar premise.  &quot;Innocent Witness&quot; is a cross between  that book and Karr's own &quot;Child of the Night,&quot; where a child  psychologist uses play therapy to break through to a little girl who has  become remote following the death of a parent.  I would recommend &quot;The  Littlest Witness&quot; over this one (but not &quot;Child of the  Night,&quot; which is horrible).  Readers who do decide to give  &quot;Innocent Witness&quot; a chance will find a warm story with  well-developed characters told in Karr's unique style.<br />Though not too  suspenseful, the author provides many suspects for the mystery, and the  story has its share of unexpected moments.  This is one of those rare  Intrigues that takes place over an extended period of time (over a month),  so we can see Deanna and Steve's romance progressing gradually.  Their  relationship is also surprisingly low on sexual tension.  There is no sex,  so readers who don't like too much overt sexuality will be relieved it  isn't here.   The antics of Deanna's daughter and Steve's son are amusing,  though anyone who doesn't like books with cute kids in them will want to  avoid this one at all costs.  Only the ending is jarring in a story that  moves slowly and smoothly, with an abrupt climax that comes out of nowhere.   While not very exciting, this is a sweet book featuring characters readers  might enjoy getting to know.  A pleasant read for a summer afternoon.	2000-07-19

The plot thickens when the woman falls over with a bullet wound in  her back.  Branson teams up with the woman's sister, who insists her sister  has not had a child, to solve the mystery.  It looks like Lacy Gilbraith is  in as much danger as her sister.  Who better to protect her than a tough  Texas lawman?<br />I was more a fan of &quot;Family Ties&quot; itself than the  brothers so many readers seem to have demanded hearing more of (Branson  himself wasn't the nicest of characters in that book, and one didn't even  appear), but I have to admit they bring out the best in the author.   &quot;The Second Son&quot; is a masterfully plotted book with strong,  dynamic characters and a story that never stops moving.  Branson and Lacy  meet in a unique opening encounter that sets off sparks right away, and  Wayne crafts a complex, twist-filled mystery to keep readers turning the  pages.  Readers should be gladly looking forward to the stories of  Branson's brothers in the next two books.  Taut and exciting, &quot;The  Second Son&quot; is an excellent start to this new miniseries.	2000-07-19

There doesn't seem to be much chance of  that when the guest of honor is murdered in the middle of it.  As the only  witness, the police are concerned her life is in danger.  Against her will,  rancher Cade Landry carries her off to his Montana ranch to protect her.   Cade really makes Barbara's blood boil.  Too bad it looks like she'll have  to depend on him, especially when his ranch turns out to be less safe than  they imagined.<br />I never know what to expect from Kelsey Roberts, whose  books can strike me as excellent (&quot;His Only Son&quot;), atrocious  (&quot;Her Mother's Arms&quot;) or somewhere in between  (&quot;Unforgettable Night&quot;).  I put off reading &quot;Wanted:  Cowboy&quot; for nearly a year because of that uncertainty.  It was well  worth the wait.  In terms of the story, this is the author at her best.<br />I  may be alone in thinking that Rose planning an Elvis-themed party for  Barbara's presentation was more thoughtless than amusing, regardless of the  end result.  For me, the first chapter was grating.  In general, though,  the humor and fast dialogue that makes her books unique are in place.  What  moves it to another level though, is the strength of the mystery and the  romance.  The mystery is successful and the ending so surprising because   Roberts drops clues in a clever way that doesn't seem like they're relevant  to the mystery.  Unlike some books where I instantly spot relevant  information, &quot;Wanted: Cowboy&quot; is expertly crafted.  I may have  guessed who the villain was, but not the motive.  I love it when a book can  catch me off guard.  This was one of them.<br />I also enjoyed the way the  relationship between Barbara and Cade's teenage daughter was developed.   Barbara was a very strong romance heroine in general, Jess was a nicely  portrayed, realistic teenage character, and the way all the relationships  built and grew was well done.  A sexy romance, plenty of suspense and a  strong mystery make this one of Roberts' best.  An excellent book.	2000-07-03
US	50735506	RUA01WVF2ZDQH	0373225717	171694184	Urgent Vows	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Urgent Vows	Joyce Sullivan returns with &quot;Urgent Vows,&quot; a page-turner with good action and nicely developed characters.  More of a suspense thriller than a mystery, it isn't the kind of book the reader can try and follow  clues to figure out who the villain is.  There are suspects, but it's clear  who the author is pushing all the attention toward for most of the book.   That isn't a criticism.  Her approach works; those looking for that kind of  mystery should simply know it isn't that kind of book. <br />What it is is an  irresistible mix of fast-paced action and high drama.  The story begins  after Quinn's brother and sister-and-law have been murdered and he is  already on the run with their children.  The emotional tension stays at  that consistently high level for much of the book.  The characters are  smart and likable and their dilemma is compelling, the kind where many  readers will be asking what they would do in the heroine's place.  The  story moves with a swiftness that breezes the reader past some of the more  far-fetched elements of the tale, making them more acceptable than they  might be if we stopped to examine them.  The shifts from scenes from the  leads' perspective to the killer's and some secondary characters' give the  story a wider scope and effectively adds to the suspense.<br />Sullivan  enriches her tale with a lot of new, interesting facts and information, all  seamlessly integrated in an unobtrusive way.  Even without the list of  acknowledgments, it's clear she's done her research, a nice change from so  many stories that are fuzzy on some details or authors who use generic plot  elements to avoid doing actual research.  It's the kind of book where I  felt like I learned something while being entertained.  A roller coaster  ride of emotions and suspense, &quot;Urgent Vows&quot; is a most successful  romantic suspense novel.	2000-07-03

She doesn't expect to see the  brother-in-law she's never met by her bedside, or the unexpected news that  she was pregnant.  Why didn't her husband tell her their fertilization  treatments were successful?  If that wasn't enough of a surprise, several  attempts are made on her life.  Her brother-in-law, Major Noah Inglewood,  vows to protect her.  It soon becomes clear she'll need all the help she  can get.<br />I enjoyed the first Fools Point book, &quot;For His  Daughter,&quot; but put off reading this one because of the nauseating  title and what I thought was going to be an amnesia plot.  I was downright  grateful to find that it wasn't.  Just when I was wondering when a romance  heroine could have a head injury and not get amnesia, Sinclair offers this  one.  She gets a big thank you from this reader.  How refreshing!<br />Fans of  Sinclair's brand of romantic suspense should not be disappointed.  The  action moves quickly and clearly.  The reader is pulled along from one  heart-stopping incident to the next.  The sexual tension is very high and  the characters are likable.  I can't judge the mystery, since I read book  three, &quot;The Silent Witness&quot; before this one and had too much  information going in.  The book did seem very predictable, though, even  with what I didn't know.  I suspected the husband's secret from the start  and was annoyed that it took Sydney so long to catch on.  She may be  excused for not guessing the eventual secret about her baby, though I still  thought that was obvious, even without the help from the back cover copy.   The pregnancy element was very forced.  It seemed unnecessary, tacked on to  add that much-needed plot hook.  The whole thing felt like it could have  been cut without changing the story too much, but then the editors wouldn'thave been able to mention it on the cover.<br />I was ready to give &quot;My  Baby, My Love&quot; four stars, since I gave &quot;The Silent Witness&quot;  three and it is better than that one.  Except that two hours after  finishing it, I'm already having trouble remembering parts of it.  I can  recall details of books I read more than ten years ago, so I don't that's a  good sign.  A little too predictable, a little lacking in depth, &quot;My  Baby, My Love&quot; is an entertaining page-turner with a lot of passion  and danger.  Just don't expect it to last in the memory too long afterward.	2000-07-03

Years ago,  her parents were accused of stealing artifacts from the tribe.  To  guarantee her son's legacy, she must prove their innocence, even if someone  is making it clear they want to keep the truth hidden.  The one man whose  help she doesn't want is the one who offers it.  He may not know it, but  Nick Black Raven is her son's father.  Can she trust that he's changed  enough for her to tell him?<br />&quot;Black Raven's Pride&quot; may please  those new to Thurlo's work.  Unfortunately, regular readers may find much  of it to be a less successful retread of her other books.  Like most of her  books, there is the expected racial conflict between one character who is  Native American and one who is not, though it is given an interesting twist  by having Eden be half white.  That at least offers a fresh element to it.   However, some of her other books, such as &quot;Breach of Faith&quot;  (Intrigue 200) and &quot;Shadow of the Wolf&quot; (217) used the same theft  of tribal artifacts plot, with one of the leads trying to prove an accused  family member is innocent.  The story line was more successful in those  books, both of which are recommended over this one.<br />This book's first  chapter is its strongest.  It kicks off with an action sequence, followed  by some heated moments as the leads reunite for the first time since their  child was conceived.  From there, the book slows way down.  The  storytelling becomes lazy in more ways than one, like when the author  offers exposition by having characters tell each other things they already  know.  (Having them preface it by saying &quot;As I'm sure you know&quot;  before launching into a long speech doesn't make it more acceptable.)<br />The  book drags in the long stretches between the action sequences and more  emotional moments.  The mystery of who is threatening Eden is solved too  early, which gets rid of much of the suspense element.  The other, less  interesting, mystery with the theft keeps going on and on for another  hundred pages.  It fails to compel because there are only three suspects,  and the characters point out from the start that one was too young to be  involved in the robbery.  A mystery with two suspects isn't much of a  mystery at all.  Even if you haven't seen her use this plot before, it  isn't very interesting.  There are also at least one distracting subplot  whose point I never understood.  It only detracted from the main  story.<br />&quot;Black Raven's Pride&quot; contains Thurlo's usual Native  American flair, a lot of good detail, and strong characters.  The story  also moves slower than most of this author's other books and the secret  baby element offers nothing we haven't read a million times before to  justify its use.  While better than last year's dismal &quot;Brothers of  Rock Ridge&quot; duet, it does not approach the author's best work.  The  Four Winds series, especially &quot;Her Destiny&quot; (427) and &quot;Her  Hero&quot; (441) are recommended instead.	2000-07-03

Now she sees him everywhere.   On the street.  Outside her apartment.  Liza is afraid she's losing her  mind. Amnesiac Mike Davis has come to New Orleans to discover what happened  to him before he was found beaten half to death in a train car five years  ago.  Can a feline detective bring these two together to solve the mystery  of their mutual pasts?<br />&quot;Familiar Obsession&quot; is a story whose  strongest parts come in its second half.  The first 100 pages are a bit  slow moving; it takes f..o..r...e...v...e..r for the main characters to meet.   The hero and heroine don't have their first conversation until page 90,  something sure to drive some readers nuts.  Most of the confusion of the  first 100 pages wouldn't exist if the two simply talked to each other (as  the ever-perceptive Familiar points out).  It is a lack of communication at  its most annoying.  <br />Their first real meeting comes so late in the book  that most readers won't expect a full-fledged romance.  They won't get it.   When the main characters finally reunite, they're back in love in the blink  of an eye and the mystery becomes the focus of the rest of the book.  That  isn't exactly a bad thing.  Burnes handles the mystery with her usual  expertise, as she offers a range of suspects and motives, and deftly drops  clues and information.  She also includes one of her hallmarks, a juicy  antagonist who keeps interfering with the leads' investigation at the wrong  moments.  The tension, at least in the suspense portion, remains at a high  level throughout the book.  It's always fascinating to see how the author  fully integrates Familiar in the story, when some writers can't seem to  come up with enough for two characters to do and as usual, the cat proves  wiser than any of the human characters.  The final fifty pages feature some  clever plotting, good twists and another nail-biter of an ending.  What  started out as a three-star book finished as a four for me.  Romance  readers may (justifiably) have their quibbles, but &quot;Familiar  Obsession&quot; should delight mystery readers and Familiar fan's alike.	2000-06-28

When Nicki Michaels' friend witnessed a murder but refused to come forward and tell  the police what she saw, Nicki reluctantly went in her place.  Too bad the  man she implicated was Alex Coughlin.  She and Alex had a brief affair  before he left town years ago, and now the former bad boy was back in Fools  Point, finding trouble all over again.  Nicki didn't believe Alex could be  the killer.  And when a murderer whose specialty is in making bombs  suddenly targets Nicki, Alex may be the only man she can  trust.<br />Sinclair's tale is blessedly free of most of those  &quot;hooks&quot; the editors (and no one else) seem so fond of.  No kids  of any kind, no weddings, no amnesia.  That's reason enough to like it.   The book will also appeal to those who like their romantic suspense novels  to be more of a thriller.  Sinclair launches straight into the action and  never lets up.  Constant action and characters who are in danger and always  on the move will leave many readers breathless.  <br />At the same time, the  relentless pace sacrifices a lot.  The story is frequently confusing.   Sinclair often introduces information with a familiarity that suggests this  is something we should already know.  There's no time to absorb any of it  because we're already moving on to something new.  While I had a pretty  good overall idea what the mystery involved by the end, I was still fuzzy  on many details, and really didn't care enough to go back and try and  figure it out.  I don't think the mystery was that complicated, yet the way  the author tells it makes it seem far too complex and hard to  understand.<br />The frenetic pace also makes it hard to form any attachment  to the lead characters.  The romance seems forced, often popping up out of  nowhere and then dropping out of sight for extended periods.  There are  long stretches in the second half when any trace of romance, or even any  sense that Nicki and Alex are still working together, disappear, as the  scene begins to get crowded with secondary characters.  I would almost say  this is a book mainstream thriller readers would like better than romance  readers.<br />Another concern:  I still haven't gotten around to reading book  two, &quot;My Baby, My Love&quot; (the hook-heavy cover--pregnant woman is  struck with amnesia and man pretends to be her mate!--gave me every reason  not to), yet the events of that book are discussed so much I feel like I  know half of what happened in it, plus who the villain is.  Anyone with any  desire to read it might want to hit that one first.<br />There is much to  admire in the style Sinclair has chosen, a welcome change of pace from  books that overdose on the romantic hand wringing and don't give enough  meat in the mystery.  Sinclair packs a lot of mystery in her book and her  voice is strong and distinctive, but the story is almost too fast-paced.   Combining the style with a little more clarity will make her a writer to  reckon with.  I would recommend the first Fools Point, &quot;For His  Daughter&quot; instead.	2000-05-28

Daniels' &quot;Intimate Secrets.&quot;  Two years ago, Josie O'Malley fled her home in Texas.  Pregnant, in danger, and unwilling to be forced into  marriage with a man who didn't love her, she made a new life for herself  and her baby daughter in Montana.  Then Clay Jackson turned up in town.   Clay Jackson, who she's known all her life.  Clay, the father of her child.   He's been trying to solve a jewel theft that happened shortly before she  left town, and he's sure it can't be a coincidence that the trail has led  him to Josie.  He knows she's keeping something from him.  But  what?<br />&quot;Intimate Secrets&quot; features all the conventions about  secret child books that make me and most people I know throw up their hands  at this overused device.  I groaned at every one of the annoying  complications the author threw on to justify the baby secret and drag out  the revelation for as long as she could.  The number of misunderstandings  are insanely convoluted.  The book even contains one of those irritating  sequences where Josie has something to tell Clay, but no, he says she can  tell him later.  Anyone who cringes at the very mention of a secret baby  should be warned, there is nothing here to convince you this plot should  ever be used again.<br />That said, the story still worked its way under my  skin, enough for me to say that it is the best of this month's Intrigues.   It's also probably Daniels' best book since &quot;Undercover  Christmas.&quot;  My main complaint about some of her more recent work  (&quot;A Father for Her Baby,&quot; &quot;Stolen Moments&quot;) is that, in  keeping her characters constantly on the run, I never got the impression  that they got to know each other well enough to make the sort of  life-changing decisions they inevitably did in the end (especially in  &quot;Stolen Moments&quot;).  It's different this time, as Josie and Clay's  relationship changesand evolves enough to make us believe they have a  lasting future together.  Even when I was annoyed by the cliche they were  trapped in, I kept reading.  Daniels writes with warmth and charm and her  characters are likable.  Josie and Clay are both strong and intelligent,  and their passion feels real.  I came to care about them both.  The  secondary characters are developed in a few deft strokes that brings them  to life without overshadowing the leads.  The mystery is well done, an  equal part of the story with the romance as it should be in an Intrigue.   The final twist is a surprise because we've been expertly mislead to  believe things were more straightforward than they are.  Nicely done.<br />The  book is still seriously underwritten, even more so than usual for this  author, with some moments and emotions skimped on.  Judging by the huge  page margins and large type, there was more than enough room to flesh out  this tale some more.  (Normal type and margins would probably make this  more of a 220 page book than the 248 it clocks in at).  Still, I would  recommend it as a solid example of romantic suspense.  Anyone who can still  stomach this plot hook will find &quot;Intimate Secrets&quot; to be a  satisfying romance and mystery.	2000-05-28

Detective Jack McCabe is on leave from the police force while he recovers  from a bullet wound.  For Jack, it means uninterrupted days of drinking  beer and watching TV...until his downstairs neighbor arrives on his doorstep  in the middle of the night with his four-year-old daughter in tow.  Giving  Jack the girl before he can refuse, the man runs off, only to be killed in  the building parking lot moments later.  Jack has no idea what to do with  young Megan and turns to her babysitter, Hailey Bishop, for help.  When it  becomes clear that Megan is in danger, too, Jack and Hailey have no one to  rely on but each other.<br />Leigh's tale begins with a welcome touch of  attitude as our grumpy hero finds himself with a kid he doesn't want and  doesn't understand.  Some of Jack's beliefs about kids will inspire some  laughs, and Megan is as cute as expected.  Her reactions to losing her only  parent are often quite moving.  Though the romantic aspect is somewhat slow  to develop, with the sexual tension really not appearing until almost the  midway point, Leigh allows her characters to get to know each other first  before any sparks appear, an approach many readers will find rewarding.   This gives the growing relationship more of a basis, and several extended  romantic interludes will please.  Hailey is an appropriately plucky  heroine, Jack is perfect for those who like their heroes to have a slight  edge, but naturally with a heart of gold deep down inside, and their banter  is quick and funny (&quot;Are you laughing at me?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;)   The authors fully develops three warm, likable characters who readers  should have no trouble rooting for.<br />The mystery aspect is somewhat less  satisfying.  Leigh keeps the action moving and the suspense sequences are  well done, but the mystery itself simply isn't that interesting, despite  some nice touches along the way.  It is fairly straightforward, with few  suspects or real surprises to take the story off a predictable path that's  pretty clear a third of the way in.  With its generic bad cops and  motivation, the crime element is overly familiar, with nothing added to  spice it up this time around. The secondary characters are never developed  well enough to make the &quot;surprise&quot; ending too effective.  Jack  and Hailey might have been &quot;stunned&quot; by the revelation of the  main villain, as the good guys in these books always are, but since we have  little invested in the secondary characters and even less in any of the  relationships but the main one, it fails to have that much of an impact.   There are also some loose ends whose answers weren't really provided.  Were  we meant to accept the possible explanations the leads characters thought  up as the real ones?  With one exception, where they figure out Megan's  role, the scenes where Jack and Hailey try to figure out the mystery are  the least interesting ones in the book.  Not a good sign.<br />&quot;Little  Girl Found&quot; (A title that makes no sense.  Megan is never  &quot;found&quot; in any sense of the word.  She's simply handed over.)  is  still a pleasant tale with a solid love story and, for those who like kids  in their romances, a cute child.  Those who are more interested in the  romance than the mystery will find characters worth spending time with in  its pages.	2000-05-20

A prominent New Orleans attorney has been found murdered in Michelle  Pelletier's apartment.  She was there when it happened, but can't remember  exactly what did happen.  That makes her the prime suspect to the police,  including Detective Phillip Betancourt.  But as Betancourt finds himself  drawn to the fiery Michelle and increasingly convinced of her innocence,  the evidence against her builds.  Someone wants to make her look guilty,  even if it means getting rid of her for good.<br /><br />I don't usually read  Intimate Moments and I'm pretty tired of amnesia stories, but I decided to  get this one when I saw that it won the Golden Heart.  I'm glad I did.  \\"Remember the Night\\" is the kind of polished work that makes it  hard to believe this is Ms. Castillo's first book.  Simmering with sultry  energy and a consistently high level of suspense, it's a fine example of  the genre.  Both of the leads were well-defined, and Michelle was  especially complex: alternately angry, weepy and tough as nails.  I highly  enjoyed several encounters where she fought back against anyone who was  pressuring her or being just plain cruel.<br /><br />\\"Tense\\" is the word  I think best describes the book.  It's one of those novels where the  characters' angry confrontations keep you turning the pages, the dialogue  flies and suddenly you realize you've zipped through the chapter and you  need to stop gripping the book so tightly!  Castillo keeps raising the  stakes all the way to the end, putting her characters against  insurmountable odds and letting them triumph through the strength of their  personalities.  It's true that the mystery won't surprised seasoned  readers, and there's very little here that we haven't seen in one form or  another.  What makes it special is the author's sharp writing, strong  characters and ability to create loads of sexual and emotional tension, all  of which combine to make the story feel fresh and engaging.<br /><br />There are two  things that keep me from giving it five stars.  While I admired Michelle's  self-reliance early on, toward the end I started to get irritated.  Her  early distrust for Betancourt made sense, but after he put his job on the  line and bent over backward to help her, wasn't it about time she started  trusting him?  At one point, she's confident in their love.  There is a  time lapse, and as the next paragraph starts, she's sure he never loved her  and it was all an act, or some nonsense like that, for a ridiculous reason.  I just wanted to shake her.  Also, the end left me a little unsatisfied.  Some of the people in the book were just awful toward her, and I wanted to  see their reactions once she was cleared of the crime.  She also learned  some things that changed her relationships with the people around her and  her own future, yet we never get to know how those people responded to the  revelations, or even how Michelle's life would change.  In the last  chapter, we find out about Betancourt's plans for the future, but nothing  about Michelle's.  I read it three times to see if I missed anything, but  the information wasn't there.  I read the book in one sitting, partly  because I wanted to see those reactions and find out those answers, and was  disappointed not to find them.  It probably says something about how much I  liked it that I cared enough to want to know.<br /><br />But those are just nitpicky  things.  \\"Remember the Night\\" is still an excellent book I highly  recommend to romantic suspense fans.	2000-05-17

Chance Quarrels' restless spirit made it so he could never stay put in one place for long.   Yet when he came back to Silver Springs he always knew he could count on  Prudence Prescott to be waiting for him.  This time, he didn't come back by  choice.  He was driven back by killers who wanted to stop him from  testifying in an upcoming trial.  Except now Pru wanted nothing to do with  him.  He'd left her one time too many, pregnant with a daughter he knew  nothing about.  But when the killers found out about the baby before Chance  did, Pru had no choice.  She needed him.<br />&quot;The Lone Wolf's  Child&quot; smoothly continues the storyline started in last month's  &quot;Heart of a Lawman&quot; while telling a fully formed story of its  own.  Chance and Pru's romance is quite poignant.  They long for each other  even when they're apart and we can feel the love that burns between them  even before their first encounter in the book.  This rodeo man and the  preacher's daughter make a couple to root for.  As usual, Rosemoor find  numerous ways to put her leads in dangerous situations, keeping the tension  high and the action moving.<br />About the biggest compliment I can give the  book was that I went in not wanting to read it at all and still enjoyed it.   Rosemoor's entry in the secret baby marathon is a well told tale that drew  me in by making me care about the people involved, which went a long way to  helping me overcome the fact that they were living a cliche.  I was able to  understand their motives and sympathize with both sides by the end.  I  started out siding with Pru 100%, but Chance's wanderlust was well  explained and established.  By the end, I just wanted them to find a happy  ending.  Well done.  Anyone who's had enough of this plot hook won't find  anything new here, but those who can't get enough of it should find  &quot;The Lone Wolf's Child&quot; to be a fine example of the genre.	2000-05-07
US	50735506	R8U669ZPUX4W7	0373221339	738005742	Jigsaw	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Characters in Search of a Clue	I read this book when it came out in 1990 and always remembered it fondly.  Unfortunately, when I reread it recently I learned it wasn't as good as I believed.  Laura Penn is dragged into a murder investigation when the prime suspect, her ex-husband, names her as his alibi, then asks her to play  along.  Laura is horrified, but doesn't believe him guilty so agrees.  But  when more murders occur, with her ex looking more and more suspicious,  Laura begins to fear she made a mistake.  Then there are the strange items  that begin appearing in her locked home, items linked to each of the murder  scenes.  Detective Max Elliott knows Laura is lying about something.  Can  he get her to confide in him before she becomes the next  victim?<br />&quot;Jigsaw&quot; is an acceptable romance.  Max and Laura's  relationship is developed well, though it won't set the world on fire.   This is also one of the most frustrating suspense novels I can remember  reading.  There aren't that many twists.  The only thing that keeps the  plot going on so long is the leads' inability to see the obvious.  St.  George lays out all the necessary clues early on, making it easy for the  reader to see where she's going, but the characters consistently refuse to  see what's right in front of their faces.  I felt like I was having a  flashback to when my kids were trying to learn math.  1 + 1 = 3?  No.  1 +  1 = 4?  No.  1 + 1 = 5?  NO!  (OK, for the record, my kids were better at  math than that!)  More than once I threw down the book when the characters  dismissed important information or failed to see that 1 plus 1 does equal  two.  The book  also features the kind of climax where the heroine is made  vulnerable through sheer stupidity.  By the end of this exercise in  frustration, I really didn't care if they lived or died.  Just as long as  they finally got a clue.  (On a side note, Laura Gordon tells a similar  tale in Intrigue # 282, &quot;Dominoes,&quot; which is slightly better.   Slightly.)<br />St. George's other Intrigues, &quot;Murder By the Book&quot;  (# 198), &quot;Cache Poor&quot; (# 230) and &quot;The Renegade&quot; (#358)  are all far superior to &quot;Jigsaw,&quot; which is neither as deep or  well written as her later work.  I would suggest passing on this one and  looking for any of those instead.	2000-04-30
US	50735506	RBCDCTD0BHSW6	0373225644	527579704	No Bride But His (Lovers Under Cover) (Intrigue)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Good Story; Second In a Trilogy	Carly Bishop returns with &quot;No Bride But His,&quot; a Lovers Under Cover title.  Undercover agent J.D. Thorne has made enemies while investigating the militia group known as the TruthSayers.  When he stumbles too close to one particular truth, an attempt is made on his life, right on  the doorstep of Seattle PD Detective Ann Calder.  J.D. and Ann had shared a  simmering attraction she refused to let develop.  Now, with his life in  danger, she has to hide him.  Ann has no choice but to take him to the  isolated religious community where she grew up.  Shunned for a youthful  transgression, she has never returned since she left.  Now, to gain  admittance, she has to claim J.D. is her husband.  It is a charade he is  too willing to be a part of.<br />The cover and inside copy makes no mention  of this, but this book looks for all the world to be the second in a  trilogy, following November's &quot;No Baby But Mine&quot; (538).  This is  an important to know, because the events on this one are so dependent on  what we learned in the first that it does not stand on its own.  I read  &quot;No Baby But Mine&quot; months ago, and although Bishop begins by  summarizing the events of the previous book, I still had a hard time  remembering everything about the TruthSayers and what their operation  involved.  The first couple chapters are a bit confusing, as the reader has  to keep track of all these characters they haven't really been introduced  to other than in passing.  My advice to anyone who hasn't read the first  book would be to get that one first and read them back to back.<br />This  story is certainly worth it.  Once Ann and J.D. arrive in Cold Creek, the  story becomes more about them than all those external elements, as it  should be.  I can't recall a recent Intrigue, if at all, that involved this  kind of Amish-like community, and it is a fascinating change of pace.  Ann  has to struggle to reconcile with the family and life she is no longer a  part of, keeping her true nature subdued to keep them alive.  Call me a  sucker for a strong man, but I loved the moments where one of the elders  would try to berate her and J.D. would face him down and say, &quot;No man  talks to my wife that way.&quot;  Not that Ann is a wimp.  She more than  holds her own in the numerous action sequences and knows how to put J.D. in  his place when he gets too overbearing.  They make a perfect, evenly  matched couple.  A plot twist around the midway point kicks the story into  high gear, sending the characters on a desperate race against time that  will keep the pages turning.  <br />Filled with action and emotion, this was a  story I truly enjoyed.  It's a bit hard to get into, but &quot;No Bride But  His&quot; is worth the effort.	2000-04-30
US	50735506	R2I443PS8WOLEV	0373225598	429357554	Heart Of A Lawman (Sons Of Silver Springs) (Intrigue, 559)	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Love and Danger in the West	Patricia Rosemoor kicks off her latest trilogy, The Sons of Silver Springs, with &quot;Heart of a Lawman.&quot;  Bart Quarrels has returned to the ranch where he grew up to take over from his ailing father.  The ranch is in trouble, but so is Josie Wales, a newcomer in town who has amnesia.   Someone she can't remember is stalking her.  When she gets hired on at the  ranch, the danger follows, and the former lawman is forced to protect his  beautiful ranch hand.<br />&quot;Heart of a Lawman&quot; is a pleasant tale  with the feel of a traditional Western.  Cowboys are always a popular  romantic hero, but Josie is also a great heroine, a strong and capable  horse wrangler living the life many readers dream of.  Rosemoor does her  usual fine job building the sense of danger, with a number of tense  encounters and perilous moments.  I suspected who the villain was at one  point, but the author made it so I was never too sure I was right.  The  final showdown is a nail-biter, and the glimpses of what's to come in the  next two books are truly intriguing.<br />I do have to admit this is a story I  liked more than I loved.  While I've often commented on Intrigues that have  plenty of romance and too little action, this one has the opposite problem.   There is plenty of action and a number of subplots, but the romance is  very underdeveloped.  It's 200 pages in before Bart and Josie move past the  little sparks they occasionally feel around one another and really seem to  make a connection.  This is the kind of book where the author has to  mention in the epilogue how the relationship has progressed, since she  didn't have time to show the development of the romance in her story.  She  also leaves some loose ends, some of them obviously set up for events in  the coming books, but some of which felt like they should have been  answered in this one.  Sadly, the characters of Bart's children probably  could have been cut and the story would have hardly changed, they were sounderdeveloped.<br />On the whole, Rosemoor's fluid writing style and flair  for keeping readers guessing will have them turning the pages.  &quot;Heart  of a Lawman&quot; is a pleasing tale that indicates she has some  interesting tales in store for her readers in the coming months.	2000-04-23
US	50735506	R2IZA8S1OLEMCP	037322561X	984385930	Her Private Bodyguard (Harlequin Intrigue #561)	Books	3	8	13	N	N	A Different Kind of Mystery Man	Gayle Wilson's team of former CIA operatives are back in \\"Her Private Bodyguard,\\" a different kind of story from the first books in the \\"Men of Mystery\\" series.  Valerie Beaufort doesn't want a bodyguard.  Grey Sellers doesn't care.  She's probably not in any danger,  but Grey's been hired to make sure nothing happens to her anyway.  Isolated  on her ranch, Grey discovers that the greatest danger to a man with secrets  isn't a bullet, but a woman like Valerie.<br /><br />Although all of Wilson's  present-set romances have been published under the Intrigue banner, they  really fall into two different categories:  romantic suspense (the  \\"Home to Texas\\" trilogy, the first three \\"Men of  Mystery\\" books) and more standard long contemporary romance  (\\"Each Precious Hour,\\" \\"Never Let Her Go,\\" etc.).  In  the first, the suspense and the romance unfold at the same time, as the  characters fall in love while struggling to stay alive or solve a mystery.  In the second, the characters fall in love in the middle of relatively  uneventful surroundings.  The danger, only alluded to before, appears in  the final half or third to test the relationship or force them to confront  their feelings, more a plot element than a full part of the story.  \\"Her Private Bodyguard\\" falls firmly in the second category, a  tale heavy on the romance and light on the action.<br /><br />In the first respect,  Wilson gives readers a romance to cherish.  Grey and Valerie are her usual  hard-edged hero and fiercely independent heroine, two people with no  intention of falling in love and no idea how to deal with it when they find  they are.  Their interactions sizzle, and both are well-drawn  three-dimensional characters.  Unlike in Wilson's last book, \\"Each  Precious Hour,\\" we get to see them grow and change and their love  story clearly develops over the course of the book.  They also have a ton  of angst to work through and by the time the book closes with a triumphant  and poignant scene, we get tobask with them in the glory of overcoming  their pasts and fears.<br /><br />At the same time, two very unhappy people  bickering and mistrusting each other with little plot movement to break it  up can make for slow going after a while, even for those (like me) who like  some angst.  Of course, no one expects comedy or even lighthearted moments  in a Wilson book, but in some of her others the suspense element has served  to balance the angst.  Here, not only do the characters each have a dozen  chips on their shoulders (Men, her money, painkillers, her disability...why  isn't Valerie in therapy?), but there is nothing to break up the anguish  for most of the book.  It got to be pretty depressing after a while.  For  the first 150 pages (out of 251) there is only one sort-of suspenseful  moment; the conflict is all internal and most of the events are along the  lines of \\"Should Valerie take an aspirin?\\"/\\"Should she take  him a dinner tray?\\"  There are almost no secondary characters to speak  of, as they are given the most perfunctory characterization; the four main  suspects blur together.  Beautifully written though it is, even readers  engrossed early on may find the book a bit of a slog by the midway point.  The final third is pretty action packed, though the change is so radical  from the earlier sections it is almost jarring.  The CIA also feels like an  afterthought and not as compelling as before.<br /><br />Readers just finding the  series may want to start with the first three books (the RITA nominated  \\"The Bride's Protector,\\" the even better \\"The Stranger She  Knew,\\" and \\"Her Baby, His Secret\\") while they're still  available, since the references to characters from those books in this one  may be meaningless or confusing.  Those who like the emphasis on the love  story, the angst high, and don't like other elements interfering may find  this to be their favorite.  I'm sure some will love it.  In any case,  readers may want to know this is a very differentkind of story than the  other \\"Men of Mystery\\" books, and for me at least, not as fulfilling.	2000-04-23

The mother's body was found later that night, and  Kate has been in hiding ever since, raising another woman's children as her  own...  Joe Riley never knew about the twins he'd fathered, and his search to  find them leads him to Kate's door.  It also brings back the danger she'd  been fleeing all those years ago.  Suddenly, the family is on the run  again, with Joe forced to protect the children he never knew, and the only  mother they've ever known.<br />It's always nice to find an Intrigue that has  the power to truly surprise me, and this was one.  Rice tells a taut,  suspenseful tale sure to keep readers riveted, and just when you think  she's settled into a groove and you know where the plot's going, she  delivers a jolt that sends her characters in another direction.  There were  about three times when I had to put down the book and recover from a sudden  plot twist (although in retrospect, at least one of them shouldn't have  been so surprising.  More savvy readers than me might catch on quicker).   The climax alone contains a horrifying moment sure to send shivers down  your spine.  Anyone who's grown weary of predictable category romances:   Get to your bookstore now!<br />While that element is what makes  &quot;Protecting His Own&quot; such a standout, it also fulfills the  requirements of romantic suspense.  Although throwing the reader right into  the action means the character development doesn't start until a ways in,  Rice does take the time to show Joe's growing devotion to his children and  the possibility that these people can truly form a family.  The  six-year-old twins, Robbie and Ashleigh, are more &quot;real&quot; than the  too-cute kids in so many romances and played a key part of the story.  Theheroine does have an unfortunate tendency to be slow on the uptake at  times, but with her inner strength and determination to keep her children  safe no matter what, she is a true heroine.  These are four characters it  is impossible not to care about, which makes the sudden circumstances  they're caught in so much more compelling.<br />Now that I've said all that,  buy the book for the thrills.  Although not one of the bigger name authors,  Rice has written a book worth getting for anyone looking for a story both  surprising and heartwarming.	2000-04-23
US	50735506	R26ZICO36XX8CP	0373225571	768827244	Forbidden Lover (Gallagher Justice, Book 3) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #557)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Ending on a High Note	Amanda Stevens wraps up her &quot;Gallagher Justice&quot; trilogy with the best of the three books, &quot;Forbidden Lover.&quot;  Dr. Erin Casey never knew her father and brother, members of a crime family her mother fled when  Erin was just a baby.  She's come to Chicago to accept a prestigious  position in forensic science, not to reconnect with the O'Roarkes.  Then  she meets Detective Nick Gallagher, who needs her help determining the  cause of death for a newly-found body.  The attraction between Nick and  Erin is quick and powerful.  Until Erin discovers that the O'Roarkes and  the Gallaghers are mortal enemies.  In the struggle between her love and  the family she has never known, another party enters the fray:  a killer,  determined to bury the secrets of a long ago murder that ties the two clans  together.<br />Of the books, &quot;Forbidden Lover&quot; comes the closest to  that page-turning quality the cover quote mentions.  Nick and Erin find  themselves targeted by a killer from the moment they retrieve the body.  A  thrilling sequence in a cabin in the woods is edge-of-your-seat stuff, and  things don't let up much from there.  I read it in one sitting, not wanting  to put it down once I started.  Nick and Erin were two people I honestly  liked.  They were the kind of characters who felt like personal friends by  the time the book was finished, and I really cared about their wonderfully  written love story and how they would find their way out of the dangerous  situation they found themselves in.  Though the final chain of events  unfold a bit too easily, with a series of revelations and reconciliations  that hardly touch on the emotions they must inspire, happy readers are not  likely to mind in the least.  The surprise twists keep coming until a  satisfying ending that not only wraps up this tale, but loose ends from the  last two.   <br />Although the Gallagher books do stand on their own, readers  just starting the series might want to be warned that Stevens does mention  the villain of the previous book, &quot;Secret Admirer,&quot; in this one.   They don't need to be read in order, but it might be more rewarding to get  in from the start.  Like the author, readers may want to save the best for  last.	2000-04-08

Captured and tortured by government agents in her small Latin  American country, he soon returned to the United States, knowing nothing of  the child she carried--his child.  Mariana has been on the run ever since.   Now, desperate to find a safe life for her and her daughter, she reaches  out for help--and is led to Scott.  He's never forgotten her or what she  did, but now they will have to work together.  To discover why individuals  in both of their governments will do anything to find them, and to  recapture a passion that neither time nor betrayal could kill.<br />In this  era when prices go up while page counts go down and type gets bigger, Glick  is one of the few authors offering more story for your money.  This isn't a  disposible romance sure to be forgotten as soon as the last page is turned,  but one that will stick with the reader for a long time.  Here is what is  offered in &quot;Never Too Late:&quot; truly gripping suspense, several  steamy encounters that are among the most sensual the series has had to  offer, plenty of action sequences, heart-tugging emotion, and two  strong-willed, intelligent adults involved in the kind of passionate  romance that we know will last.  Scott and Mariana's is the kind of  larger-than-life love that seems fated.  Mariana, in particular, is a  unique heroine, a combination of old and new world sensibilities, and both  she and Scott are more nuanced than many romance leads these days.   Watching them overcome danger at every turn, and do it together, is a  joy.<br />Glick also takes that overused plot device, the secret baby, and  makes it her own.  Anyone who's sick of reading about secret babies should  check out this book to see how it can work.  The circumstances for why  Scott knows nothing about his daughter make sense, unlike so many books  where it's based on a stupid misunderstanding.  The author doesn't drag it  out for some kind of phony confrontation in the final third.  Instead,  Mariana deals with the secret like a rational human being, and Scott's  reaction to finding out is perfect.  These scenes in particular are packed  with amazing moments.  <br />Unlike nearly all the Intrigues released today,  which seem to reflect a belief that nothing happens outside North America,  this is a tale that covers a lot of ground, from Miami to the jungles of  Latin America.  It's also the kind of story full of government agents and  military treachery that only Glick and Gayle Wilson seem willing to take on  for Intrigue.  An adventure to set pulses pounding and a romance that won't  soon be forgotten, this is romantic suspense at its best.  For those making  their twentieth visit to Light Street (fans of #318, &quot;Til Death Us Do  Part&quot; will find some old friends involved) or those discovering the  series for the first time, this is one book that should not be missed.   Quite simply, I loved it.	2000-03-28

Detective Tony Gallagher is the black sheep of the Chicago Police  Department.  Years ago, he was implicated in the murder of his girlfriend.   Recently, he was  cleared of taking excessive action against a suspect.  A  true loner, he has been assigned a new partner, Detective Eve Barrett.  Eve  has more than a few secrets, including a secret crush she has harbored ever  since they grew up together in the same neighborhood.  Time has only  increased her attraction for him.  When a series of murders begin to occur,  with Tony shaping up to be the prime suspect, can Eve trust her judgment,  or her heart?<br />&quot;Secret Admirer&quot; is another wonderful Stevens  tale, with her usual strong hero and heroine and unique storytelling style.   What I liked most was that while it was a romantic mystery, it felt like  more than that.  Stevens provides the mystery and the love story, but also  spends more time fleshing out the secondary characters than we are used to.   They are not just one-note characters whose only purpose is to look  suspicious or to support the leads.  The author has created a true  community of Chicagoans, all with pasts and complicated relationships.  It  makes for a richer tale and more interesting puzzle, which compensates for  a somewhat slower pace than some of her other books.  <br />Although hardcore  mystery readers are likely to be tipped off to the killer's identity long  before intended and the ending is a bit too neat, Stevens does deliver at  least one very clever red herring sure to lead some readers astray.  Still,  the love story is the best part of all, as our heroine finally wins the man  she has loved for so long.  Tony will appeal to readers who like darker,  bad boy heroes, and Eve is his equal in every way.  The romance in book one  was more sweet and gradually discovered.  Tony andEve's romance, like the  characters, is more fiery and passionate, and readers should not be  disappointed.<br />Anyone starting the &quot;Gallagher Justice&quot;  miniseries (#549 The Littlest Witness, # 557 Forbidden Lover) in the middle  will be happy to know &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; stands on its own, a book  new readers can pick up without feeling lost at all.  It's a good thing,  too.  &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; is a book few will want to miss.	2000-03-28
US	50735506	RI4AKCVOVNWKJ	0373225601	370868277	Hers to Remember	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Romantic Suspense Without the Suspense	New author Karen Lawton Barrett provides this month's amnesia book, \\"Hers to Remember,\\" a novel where people do a lot of talking and not much else.  Three years ago, Sam Donnelly met a woman with no memory of her past.  Eventually, he married her, and the couple is expecting their  first child.  Then a head injury causes his wife's memory of her first life  to come rushing back--and leaves her unable to remember her life with him.  Adrienne Winston only remembers the ex-husband she was desperate to escape.  Can she possibly believe in safety, and a future, with this man she  doesn't know?<br /><br />Beyond a very bland hero and some goofy moments (Adrienne's  memory comes back when she trips and hits her head on the VACUUM  CLEANER? ), the biggest problem with \\"Hers to Remember\\" is that  it is another Intrigue (too common these days) where nothing happens.  For  the first hundred pages or so, the heroine keeps screaming that she is in  DANGER, but there is no indication that she is.  Some sense of the external  threat making itself felt would have been nice.  There isn't any.  There  are no threats against her, not even the slightest sign that her ex-husband  has any idea where she is.  All we have is her hysterics.  When the only  reason we have to believe the bad guy is bad, or that there even is a bad  guy, is because our heroine says he is, a heroine whose memory is  admittedly pretty spotty, it doesn't create much tension.<br /><br />Worse, the  whole book is like that.  It takes forever for any threat to develop.  For  the most part, this is just another romance where the characters spend  200-some slow pages getting to know each other, with scattered bursts of  the heroine's panic attacks and a very forced crisis at the end.  At one  point, a flood-level storm strikes the area where the characters live.  A  prime atmosphere for something suspenseful to happen or a romantic  interlude, right?  Nope.  All we get is more talking, talking, talking  about the mostmundane topics.  Worse, this is in the middle of a nearly  eighty page stretch where the \\"threat\\" from her ex-husband is  seldom mentioned, if at all, having been all but dismissed by the  characters.  She does some painting; he does some landscaping.  It's all  about as exciting as watching one of the heroine's paintings dry.<br /><br />The  opening letter tells readers to \\"hang on to your seats\\" while  reading this book.  Rest assured, only the highly excitable will be  anywhere near the edge of their chairs.  Anyone seeking just another  romance novel where people gradually fall in love, talking about their  relationship endlessly while little else happens, you may find it here (I  could see this as a Silhouette Special Edition).  Those expecting some  action, mystery or even suspense from their romantic suspense novels should  look elsewhere.	2000-03-23
US	50735506	R3IJJEN6UN48MZ	0373225555	783175063	Love At First Sight	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Entertaining, but Overstuffed Romantic Mystery	In her latest novel, B.J. Daniels takes an \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" approach to storytelling, throwing in far more elements than can be comfortably handled in such a short book.  Terrible blind  dates, long-kept secrets, matchmaking aunts, murder, grave-digging,  amnesia--even a secret baby.  Then there's a love story.  The setup is so  bizarre and unwieldy it's almost impossible to describe what the story's  about (which is one of the reasons the back cover copy is so misleading).  The gist of it is:  When an old friend is found murdered, Karen Sutton  realizes she may be able to identify the murderer.  The determined Karen  throws herself into the investigation and goes chasing after a man she  thinks is the killer--only to run into Detective Jack Adams.  It may indeed  be love at first sight, but she's going to need more than his love.  When  she becomes bait to catch the killer, she's going to need his  protection.<br /><br />While I would love for books to be this ambitious, in this  case the story's strong points are often buried by its excesses.  The first  few chapters, while often funny, are also really goofy, with a series of  far too coincidental encounters taking place one right after another.  The  back cover dutifully informs the reader that the heroine is struck with  amnesia, but that aspect takes so long to appear--and then does so out of  nowhere--that it seems like a bizarre afterthought in a story that didn't  need one more twist.  Even if the \\"man pretends to be married to woman  who can't remember otherwise\\" plot hadn't been used in an Intrigue  just last month (#552, \\"A Night Without End\\"), I doubt it would  have worked here.  It adds nothing except to give the heroine a sudden  personality transplant.  The spunky, determined Karen of the first half  bears little resemblance to the starry-eyed, lovestruck version that  appears after she loses her memory.  Compared to \\"A Night Without  End\\" and even this month's \\"Forgotten Lullaby,\\" the  heroine's reaction to find herself married to someone she doesn't  remember--simple acceptance--doesn't ring true.<br /><br />Daniels' tale does have  more than its share of strengths.  Boring is not a word anyone would  associate with it, as Daniels' plotting will keep readers on their toes  from start to finish.  Jack is a solid hero bound to win a few hearts,  strong, sexy and charming.  Though everything wraps up a bit too neatly to  be believed (Unless Missoula has a population of ten, the way all the  characters happen to be connected to one another is ridiculous), the  mystery element is the book's strongest, a puzzle many will be eager to  solve.  Unfortunately, the wildly shifting tone is its weakest.  The climax  is so taut and suspenseful, the final image of the villain so wonderfully  haunting, that it seems completely out of place with the wackiness that  started the story.<br /><br />While nowhere near as good as the moving stories full  of in-depth writing Daniels used to pen (\\"Hotshot P.I.\\"  \\"Undercover Christmas\\" \\"Odd Man Out\\") but seems to have  moved away from, readers seeking a fast-paced, lighter tale with a dash of  mystery shouldn't go wrong here.  I was certainly entertained by \\"Love  at First Sight.\\"  I also didn't believe a word of it.	2000-03-06
US	50735506	R2RMEPPDYV2N00	0373225563	449427017	Forgotten Lullaby (A Memory Away, No. 9 / Harlequin Intrigue, No. 556)	Books	1	5	16	N	N	Forget About It	Rita Herron's \\"Forgotten Lullaby\\" is the latest entry in Harlequin's amnesia derby, and easily one of the weakest. At best, it's forgettable; at worst, it's intolerable.  New mother Emma Wadsworth is  returning home one night when someone drives her off the road.  Struck with  amnesia after the accident (but of course!), she returns home to her  husband Grant and their baby daughter. Her attempts to remember her old  life are hindered by further attempts to kill her. Someone wants her dead.  But why?<br /><br />The problems start with the characters. The \\"hero,\\"  Grant, isn't my idea of a hero at all.  Besides being completely  unbelievable as a male in his twenties (he's going to sigh thinking about a  romantic night dancing to CELINE DION? ), he's also relentlessly whiny and  only concerned with trying to get his wife to remember him, regardless of  her feelings.  I couldn't blame Emma for getting upset when he kept  bringing up sappy memories of their past--I was just as tired of hearing  about them.  Someone's trying to kill your wife and all you can think about  is how she can't remember your wedding?  How about trying to create a  future, pal? His reaction to one key revelation Emma makes late in the book  said it all for me; the biggest baby in this book is Grant.<br /><br />Worse is  Emma, more of a victim than a real character. I've tried to think of a  recent Intrigue heroine as weak as this one, and thankfully, I couldn't.  Intrigue heroines are strong, capable women ready and willing to fight for  their lives, loves, and what they believe in.  That description doesn't fit  Emma at all. The woman does NOTHING in this book but sit around and wait  for the next attack on her.  I've read about annoying heroines who act in  stupid ways and infuriating ones who act in the wrong ones, but I don't  ever think I've read a book where the heroine NEVER takes a SINGLE action  against the threats on her life. The only thing she does in response to the  threats is tothrow herself into her husband's arms and hope he'll make it  all better--a foolish hope since he's more interested in his job than  finding the attacker. I kept yelling, \\"DO SOMETHING! \\" She never  did. Insufferably weepy, she didn't seem to have a backbone at all, let  alone a personality, simply letting the story happen TO her. Neither of the  leads do anything to try and solve the mystery, leaving the investigating  to the police as they move through page upon angst-ridden page in the soap  opera plot.  If they don't care enough about the attacker to interrupt  their busy lives, why should I?<br /><br />What there is of a mystery is far too  easy to solve, since the clues might as well be underlined in the book.  Every once in a while Herron brings the leads' hand-wringing to a grinding  halt and has secondary characters step forward and, out of nowhere, deliver  information about themselves that seems to have no relevance. But of  course, it does! DUH! The title is also horribly misleading, playing up the  baby angle that is a very minor part of the plot. Anyone looking for a book  about a baby, don't let the title fool you. That's not really what this  book is about. The baby is conveniently passed off to secondary characters  except for when she's needed to inspire Emma's \\"How can I be a mother  if I can't remember giving birth?\\" moaning. Ms. Herron's original  title, \\"Remember Me,\\" was much more relevant, since it contains  multiple meanings in the book. But then, this title is no more misleading  than the book itself, which has the words \\"romantic suspense\\"  written all over it. It is not romantic suspense. It is a domestic drama  about two weak, whiny people, and an excruciatingly boring one.  This was  the first of this month's Intrigues I tried to read and the last one I  finished.  I could not stop putting it down.  If only I had forgotten to  buy it.	2000-02-26

The story of two people accused of  murder and on the run, it's sure to keep hearts pounding from cover to  cover.<br />When Anna Red Shoes confronts novelist Jeremy Masterson about the  way her grandfather is portrayed in his latest book, it sets off a chain of  events she couldn't have known about. First Jeremy's editor is murdered.   Convinced that Anna killed the man, thinking it was him, Jeremy chases  after her.  But when he catches up with her, a friend back home tells him  some shocking news:  the whole world thinks that Jeremy is the killer--and  Anna his accomplice!  With the world against them, they have no one to turn  to but each other...in more ways than one.<br />Like her earlier &quot;Remember  Me, Cowboy,&quot; Burnes sets up what seems like an unwinnable situation  for her hero and heroine, then keeps raising the stakes.  &quot;How on  earth are they going to get out of this one?&quot; is the question most  readers will keep asking.  The best part is how we know they have to--not  because a happy ending is ensured, but because these are two characters  capable of fighting for their happy ending.  A proud Native American woman,  Anna is another of Burnes' notably strong heroines.  Watching her turn the  tables whenever Jeremy catches her off guard is a delight, yet she's not so  tough she doesn't realize love when she finds it.  Jeremy is a rakish  heartbreaker who gives as good as he takes, and shouldn't fail to win the  hearts of readers.  The process of this confirmed ladies man figuring out  that this might be the real thing is a winner.  Together, this is one team  we know can't be beaten.  <br />The first chapter, setting up the events  before the murder, is a bit slow.  Then the story takes off at a fast clip,  offering a dizzying series of action sequences,betrayals, and dangers from  both man and nature.  Burnes' tale isn't passive entertainment, since her  suspense is nail-biting and all of her characters inspire some kind of  emotion, good or bad (I so wanted to slap Anna's friends for how suspicious  and nasty they were toward Jeremy!).  Unlike some books that are set in  Texas simply because so many are these days, the setting comes to life and  is used to full advantage.  The Native American element is handled well and  adds another layer to an already strong tale.  A wonderful romantic  adventure.	2000-02-21
US	50735506	R1TMPP4NRGSEIF	0373225520	53529673	A Night Without End	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A Pleasing Alaskan Adventure	&quot;A Night Without End&quot; is an Alaskan-set romantic mystery that should entertain fans of that exotic locale and action-packed romances.  Sean McCabe is stunned to discover the body of his foster father and mentor  in the mine they're both working, and even more shocked at the woman he  finds next to the body.  Recognizing her as Carlie Myers, the widow of one  of his best friends, he believes her when she says she's not the killer,  but her amnesia prevents her from naming the true murderer.  Thinking  quickly, he keeps her from being arrested by claiming she's his wife, not  bothering to tell Carlie it's not true.  He thinks it's the only way to  keep her out of jail and protect her from the killer, an idea that proves  to be true when the attempts on her life begin.<br />Yes, another amnesia book  (but who's looking for innovation from Intrigue, anyway?  This is the line   that makes all their books the same boring color while leaving the design  the same and calls it a &quot;new cover look.&quot;  Instead, it's a pretty  good statement about how they're trying to make these books exactly the  same.). Fortunately, author Susan Kearney packs enough action sequences in  her story to distract from that too-familiar plot element and some of the  more far-fetched aspects of her plot.  From an avalanche to a plane crash,  Kearney keeps her characters, and readers, on their toes at all times.   Carlie is also a nicely strong-willed heroine.  She may have lost her  memory, but she hasn't lost her will, or her brains. Watching her face the  dangers thrown their way with just as much courage as Sean is one of the  book's delights.  <br />The mystery is pretty well done, all of the suspects  equally suspicious throughout.  As a hero, Sean is to-die-for, and the  romance packs plenty of passion, even if the idea that the relationship  between these two is going to last is a bit unearned.  In spite of an  unnecessary prologue, which adds nothing, most of &quot;A NightWithout  End&quot; is suspenseful and engaging.  This is an entertaining tale that  is bound to keep readers dreaming about those cold Alaskan nights.	2000-02-20
US	50735506	R1YT46YR55Y9X	037322494X	726171686	Dear Santa	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Repost Review--from Intriguefan@hotmail.com	For some reason, this review was messed up in the transmission.  There are some missing passages in the copy below.  Here's the full review:<br />Alice Orr's &quot;Dear Santa&quot; pales in comparison to her last Christmas  mystery, &quot;Protect Me, Love.&quot; It begins with a great thread, with  two kids trying to keep the secret that the &quot;aunt&quot; they live with  isn't related to them at all. But just when Coyote Bellaway is on the brink  of getting the money to save him and his sister, he witnesses something  that puts his life in danger. It's up to two adults from the local  children's community center--Katherine Fairchild and Vic Maltese--to save  the boy from the danger stalking him and his sister. <br />Unfortunately, the  story becomes less interesting as it goes along. The pace isn't helped by  Orr's endless paragraphs, which basically amount to one and a half  paragraphs per page, but there's also the fact that the bad guys stay in  the background far too long and the wrap-up happens far too fast. Plus, the  bantering between Katherine and Vic is given too much time, leaving less  time for plot development. I liked the characters and cared about what  happened to them, but Vic's big secret is somewhat of a letdown (I don't  know what the back cover copy is talking about, but it is not certainly not  heart-rending.)  There are also some plot holes:  Katherine's stepson is  mentioned early and brought up a lot, yet it's never explained what  happened to her ex-husband. I had far too many questions when I was  finished.  Orr has written better books before. Some sweet moments, but not  much more.	2000-02-16

An Intrigue book digging up that dusty old romance standby, the sheikh?  Not exactly my cup of tea.  So it was a pleasant surprise to find in &quot;Captured by a Sheikh&quot; a well-told  mystery that firmly engages from page one.  <br />Holly Rivers' sister had  disappeared, leaving her baby in Holly's care.  Holly would do anything to  care for her nephew, even if it meant marrying a man she didn't love.  But  Holly's wedding plans came to a halt when Sheikh Sharif Al-Khalil, a man  who claimed he was the baby's father, tried to kidnap him.  Holly went  after him and found herself in the middle of a mystery of international  proportions.  Could she possibly trust a man who had every reason to get  rid of her sister when he claimed he had done nothing?  And what of the  killers suddenly on their tail?<br />&quot;Captured by a Sheikh&quot; tells a  tale of international intrigue too seldom seen in recent Intrigues, with a  strong emotional line that gives it an instant immediacy and rooting  interest in the characters.  Though the book shares more than a few  similarities with Diamond's first Intrigue, &quot;And the Bride  Vanishes,&quot; it is actually a breath of fresh air in many ways.  Holly  and Sharif's romance is tender, complicated by cultural issues the book  doesn't avoid, and they're surrounded by a complex cast of characters  covering a wide range of types.  While some moments and emotions are a bit  perfunctory, the author never fails to keep you turning the pages.  It's  also a book that only gets better as it goes along.  The final fifty pages  or so, full of surprise turnarounds and unexpected twists, are  white-knucklers, full of edge-your-seat suspense as the characters are  thrown into mortal danger, in a true race to survive.  Fans of this  particular theme, and those that aren't, will find much to enjoy in  &quot;Captured by a Sheikh.&quot;	2000-02-07

The main character, single mom Joni Peterson, has enough problems-which  only get worse when her ex-husband is found dead in her house.  Suddenly,  the police are treating her like the prime suspect, and the only man she  can turn to is her handsome brother-in-law, Dirk. Dirk seems to believe  her, but there's also something very important about Joni's son that he  doesn't know...<br />Diamond writes with a light style that works well for her  American Romances, but it may not work as well here. I never really felt  any of the danger Joni faced early on, and a lot of emotions seem to be  skimmed over. The title secret is revealed so casually that I had to reread  the scene just to make sure that I had just read what I thought I had. (By  the way, what secret? Even if you couldn't figure it out from the title,  the back cover spells it out in such express detail that any surprise is  ruined.) Around the midway point, things do pick up, as the suspense  finally builds, and Diamond does a good job keeping her cards close to her  chest, so the ending is both surprising and satisfying. Mainly, though,  &quot;His Secret Son&quot; is probably a good bet for those who like their  mystery light and not-too-suspenseful.	2000-02-05

Thea Lockhart is on the run with her young daughter, with more than  one reason to avoid the cops.  She has created a new life for herself and  her daughter in Chicago when a woman is killed in their building, and  Detective John Gallagher enters their world.  Gallagher insists her  daughter could be a witness; Thea wants nothing more than to get him out of  their lives.  With danger from all sides, can Thea dare to put their lives  in the hands of a man with the potential to destroy her?<br />A nicely  original story, Ms. Stevens' tale neatly avoids the clichés becoming too  common in series romance.  Hers is a tense, compelling story that should  engage readers' sympathies from the start.  Thea is the best kind of  romance heroine, an admirably strong woman, willing to do anything to  protect her child.  I doubt most of us could be as tough in her  position--her foresight with the fire escape was one detail that really  caught my attention.  Nearly all of moments involving her young daughter  will touch your heart.  As usual, Stevens keeps readers on their toes, and  the ending is a nice out-of-nowhere surprise.  Although paced slower than  usual for a Stevens book, mainly due to the need to provide so much back  story for the other two books in the trilogy, &quot;The Littlest  Witness&quot; won't disappoint.  With many plot threads left dangling, many  will be anxiously waiting for next month's portion of the Gallagher saga,  &quot;Secret Admirer.&quot;	2000-01-26

Ho hum. Another secret baby. Another federal agent with amnesia. When I picked it up, I was  pleasantly surprised.  The flashback that makes up the early chapters are  suspenseful and engrossing. The kind of fast-paced detective work Rachel  and Stephen are forced to go through in their race against time to save a  kidnap victim is a blast. Then the story moved back to the present, and  everything became familiar. Very familiar. <br />There are two things I need  to make me love these kind of books and forget that it is a story told too  often: good explanations for both the amnesia and the baby being kept a  secret. This time, the cause for the amnesia was so abrupt that it came  across as stupid and random. One minute Stephen doesn't have amnesia, the  next he has to hit his head because this is an amnesia book. I can also buy  some reasons for heroines to keep their pregnancies a secret and not let  the father know. The one offered here was not one of them. After winning my  respect in the beginning, the characters quickly lost it. Throw in the fact  that the villain was obvious, the result of too few suspects to chose from,  and &quot;Undercover Dad&quot; (A bad title. Stephen is not really  undercover through most of the book, if not all) left me cold.<br />The  problem with pointing out a three star book's flaws is that it can sound  worse that it is. &quot;Undercover Dad&quot; isn't terrible by any means.  It is old hat. Charlotte Douglas is an able storyteller with an engaging  writing style and some clever plotting. The moment where Stephen meets his  daughter is very moving. I liked her other amnesia story, &quot;A Woman of  Mystery,&quot; earlier this year. That one was surprising. This time I felt  two steps ahead of the characters most of the time.  Anyone who hasn't read  variations on this theme so many times, or who likes itreading it  repeatedly, will get more out of it than I did. A fast read, but not much  more.	2000-01-20

Carmichael's Intrigue debut, &quot;Same Place, Same Time,&quot; is an expert blend of romance and mystery, new and old, danger and passion.  Therapist Trista Emerson doesn't know which is worse.  One of her patients  has turned up dead, and her ex-husband, Detective Morgan Forester, is back  in her life.  Pain and misunderstandings broke them apart.  Now Trista  needs him.  Morgan insists she is in danger, and it isn't long before  Trista knows he is right.  She can trust him to keep her safe.  Can she  trust herself enough to let him back into her heart?<br />Carmichael's tale is  one readers will not want to miss.  The murderer's identity is sure to keep  readers guessing, and Carmichael ultimately offers a fresh take on a  classic premise.  The mystery has a similar feel to the older, much missed  stories Intrigue used to tell.  At the same time, Trista and Morgan's  relationship is complex and moving in the way some of the more recent  titles have become.  Many authors spell out everything about their  characters right away.  Carmichael has a way of slowly revealing  information about the characters' back story that feels strange early on.   In the end, it pays off big time.  We are slowly discovering who these  people are as they rediscover each other, so we are experiencing what they  are in a way few books achieve.  Throw in an original title, an excellent  use of setting in the city of Toronto, and a nail-biter finale, and  &quot;Same Place, Same Time&quot; is a New Year's treat.	2000-01-06

This is one book no romantic suspense fan  will want to miss out on.<br /><br />Bounty hunter Annie Ryan met her match in jewel  thief Liam \\"Lucky\\" Logan.  Right when she thought she had him,  the charming Lucky turned up the heat...and got away.  The last thing she  expected was for him to appear on her doorstep the next day.  Or had he?  FBI agent Matt Logan looked like his twin brother, but that was where the  similarities ended.  The by-the-book agent wanted to find Lucky, too, along  with the priceless jewel he'd stolen.  But that didn't stop the spunky  Annie from getting under his skin, or him from under hers.<br /><br />\\"Twice  Tempted\\" is similar in style to the classic \\"Catspaw\\" books  and should win fans of both those books and anyone who enjoyed \\"The  Thomas Crown Affair\\" last summer.  A caper full of surprises, Allen  has more than one trick up her sleeve that will keep readers wondering how  she's going to resolve it in the end.  The sexual tension makes this one of  the sexier Intrigues to come out recently.  This is one steamy book!  The  Boston setting adds unique flavor, and the relationship between Annie and  her family offers some moving moments.  The book also has one of the best  uses of cliffhangers at the ends of chapters that I've read recently.  Almost every chapter ends with a surprise twist that sends the story in  another direction and raises the odds.  Pretty soon, the idea of reading  \\"just one more chapter\\" has become meaningless, since the  temptation to keep going on to find out what happens next is too great.  It  kept me up all night.  I could not have been happier.<br /><br />The only problem  with the book is Harlequin's strange decision to run a letter from the editor on the second page like Silhouette does, instead of offering an  author biography and backlist.  I don't knowwhy they want to copy what  other lines do, but a list of previous books would be more handy for  readers sure to be looking for Allen's other books.  The year 2000 is not here yet.  \\"Twice Tempted\\" is still a strong contender for the  best 2000 Intrigue.  I loved it.	1999-12-28

The Canadian setting is used  well to take readers on a coast-to-coast tour that is always a welcome  change of pace.  More important, Paige and Matt's relationship develops  nicely, offering moments both moving and passionate, and by the end it is  clear they are made for each other.  The final chapter where they find  their happy ending is beautiful.  And I remember my own pregnancy well  enough to admire Paige's creative choice of weapon in the climax. :) <br />The  only problem I had was with the boring title.  They could have called it   \\"Obligatory Baby/Amnesia Book #...\\"  at that rate.  It also doesn't reflect  the book too well.  Ms. Sullivan's first title she had listed on her web  page was much better.  The covers may not impress.  What is between them is  sure to.	1999-12-27

Anyone expecting another thrilling, fast-paced tale like those  from her &quot;Men of Mystery&quot; trilogy earlier this             year  should probably put those expectations on hold. <br />            Senator  James McCord is preparing to announce his candidacy for president on  January 1, 2000, and his niece Robin is             fully involved in the  preparations. But Robin has other things on her mind: she's three months  pregnant, and the campaign             has brought her back to New York,  where the baby's father lives. Differences kept them apart in the past, and  he doesn't             know about the child. But when a deadly political  plot begins to emerge, with Robin right in the crosshairs, Jared forces              himself back in her life, and Robin has no choice but to accept his  help. <br />            I could probably overlook the fact that the villain is  clear by the midway point or that it's yet another secret baby book.              But although there's a high level of sexual tension, the romance is  pretty static. Jared and Robin's positions on the             difference  that kept them apart have been established before the book began, and they  don't change until one character             finally caves in the end to  ensure the happy ending. For the most part, the love story amounts to  little more than them             coming together, saying nothing's changed  and they have nothing to talk about, then parting repeatedly. <br />             A high interest in politics is probably required, too, since the first  hundred pages has more political strategizing than actual             plot.  I don't care about politics that much, so when Wilson actually takes the  time to let us know McCord's positions on             Russia and Israel, I  was thinking this was a little more info than I needed. Plus, certain plot  points make little sense. In the             beginning, we're told that  McCord plans to announce his candidacy from a hotel in Times Square just  after the ball drops             on New Year's Eve. In the real world,  haven't all the candidates declared long before the first of the year?  Don't they             have to? And the idea that McCord thinks anyone  would be paying attention to him in Times Square on the beginning of              the year 2000 is either supreme arrogance or sheer stupidity.<br />             As usual, Wilson's use of language in her prose is superb. More than a  few scenes will linger in the memory: Jared's             discovery of  Robin's pregnancy is very well done, and one erotic moment involving taste  is enough to make you need to             open a window. Too bad the first  100 pages are a bit tedious, buried in political planning and little  forward movement, with             few threats to make you think there's  going to be any suspense (I think there's a grand total of...one). The  second hundred slowly but surely begin to pick up             steam  (threats actually arrive!) and the final fifty is a complete adrenaline  rush, with a climax that is nothing short of             amazing. Wow--just  try to hold back the tears. The book is probably worth it for the final ten  pages alone. But whether a             great payoff is worth it without  much of a buildup is to the reader's discretion.	1999-12-06

She's forced to turn to the town sheriff, with whom she had a relationship  she can't remember, and who has more than a few secrets of his own.<br />A  page-turner to keep you up all night, &quot;Memories&quot; is an able  blending of past and present, love and danger, that shouldn't fail to  capture any reader.  Clint and Darlene's previous love affair is  intertwined with their current flirtation very effectively, making it clear  this is a couple with a future.  The tangled web of relationships between  everyone involved adds another layer to the tale, although the impact of  Wayne's story is diminished somewhat through Harlequin's atrocious decision  to spell out the relationship between Clint and McCord in all of the ads  for &quot;The McCord Family Countdown,&quot; when she keeps it a studied  secret through much of the book.  Still, there's enough danger and action,  as well as a complex mystery, to overshadow that minor annoyance.<br />Unlike  so many books, it's refreshing to see one set in the two weeks before  Christmas that barely mentions the holiday.  (Not surprisingly, the  characters have better things to do).  And how's this for a Christmas  present: next year will finally bring the sequels to &quot;Family  Ties&quot; (still my choice for her best book) when Wayne offers a new  trilogy about the Randolph family in the summer.  If they're as good as  this, her fans will be waiting on pins and needles until they arrive.	1999-11-30
US	50735506	R33EQ5DHQO7ALL	0373225431	134036395	Stroke Of Midnight	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Stroke of Genius	New books from Jenna Ryan don't come out nearly as often as they used to, so each one is cause for celebration.  \\"The Stroke of Midnight\\" is no exception.  With her distinctive writing style and flair for  suspense, Ryan tells a tale that's sure to turn up the heat, even when  sending chills up your spine.    In Philadelphia, a serial killer has  murdered a radio talk show host on each Christmas of the last seven years.   Last year, a man confessed to the crimes.  But now, Devon Tremayne is  receiving the same threats of the seven women killed before her.  The  police believe it's just a hoax--all except Detective Joel Riker.  The  sexy, closed-mouthed cop has vowed to protect her.  But when even Riker has  secrets he refuses to let her know, is there any hope that Devon won't be  another victim--killed on Christmas Eve at the stroke of midnight?    A  top-notch antidote for those tired of the glut of sappy holiday releases  coming our way, \\"The Stroke of Midnight\\" is another of Ryan's  dark, atmospheric tales of love found in the most frightening of  circumstances.  The romance between Devon and Riker smolders before sparks  begin to really fly, and both characters are well-drawn, an impressive feat  considering all that's going on around them.  Though astute readers will  probably get clued in to the killer's identity long before intended, Ryan  provides enough twists and excitement to keep you glued to the page.  I would relish any Ryan story just for the  atmosphere, and \\"Stroke of Midnight\\" doesn't fail on that count.  Even the cover is beautiful--and not only do the characters look like  they're described in the book, but they're wearing the colors they're  constantly described as wearing!  It may be a little thing, but considering  how often the heroes on these things look like those same cover models or  the heroine has the wrong color hair, it's a relief.      If you love  romance and true suspense, put \\"The Stroke of Midnight\\" on your  To Buy list and watch a master at work.	1999-11-29
US	50735506	R256LR80QEWIPQ	0373225423	774618507	Familiar Christmas (Fear Familiar)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Time to Curl Up with a Holiday Classic-to-be	Caroline Burnes' Fear Familiar books have always been thoroughly captivating, so it's saying something that \\"Familiar Christmas\\" might be the most charming book the series has had to offer.  Throw in the  fact that it's also an excellent romantic mystery and holiday tale and  Burnes' accomplishment is even more remarkable.<br /><br />Sylvie West has never  been a big fan of the holiday season.  It doesn't look like that's about to  change when she's kidnapped from her job in a toy store by a gunman dressed  as Santa Claus.  Hunter Semmes insists that Christmas is about to be ruined  by those determined to get their hands on his new toy invention--so  determined they might harm children to do it.  Sylvie's head tells her  Hunter has to be a madman; her heart isn't quite so sure.  And with just  three days til Christmas, there's no time to waste finding out who the true  threat is.<br /><br />Burnes manages to find the right balance between light and  dark elements, suspenseful action and holiday warmth in a tale that never  fails to delight.  The characters are in a constant state of motion, yet  Burnes is still able to develop them into three-dimensional characters we  truly care about.  Hunter and Sylvie are both strong, intelligent people,  and I appreciated how, with one big exception, there wasn't a multitude of  distrust and misunderstandings--just smart thinking and working through the  situations thrown at them.  These two were using their heads, and I liked  them that much more for it.  The mystery is consistently surprising, where  no one is what they seem to be.  The ending alone is packed with twists  until the final villain is revealed.  And of course, there's the intrepid  feline detective Familiar, as entertaining as ever.  The scenes with the  credit card alone were wonderful.<br /><br />Truly original, first-rate  entertainments like this don't come along very often.  It doesn't matter if  this is your first encounter with the series or your twelfth,don't miss  out.  Heart-tugging and action-packed, \\"Familiar Christmas\\"  deserves to become a holiday classic.	1999-11-28
