This is a real loser. I bought it thinking it was relatively new before I realized it had been written a few years ago, early in Meltzer's career. <br /> <br />For those looking for a thrilling, well-written read for the beach or an airplane flight, I recommend you check out the author Harlan Coben, who I recently discovered, and just love.	2005-06-19

I found the tone of the book to be somewhat self-pitying and monotonous. Strangely, the only review here I seem to agree with was written below by the wife of another quadiplegic.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect about this topic, the devastating accident and its immediate aftermath, are glossed over quickly in the first few pages. The remainder of the book is the author going, \\"Woe is me, look how my life has deteriorated.\\" Don't get me wrong, I don't think I could have handled what she went through, but the book makes the wife more of a victim than the husband.<br /><br />There is nothing in the book about the husband's initial reaction to waking up and learning he was paralyzed after such an active life; virtually nothing about how he coped with the injury psychologically.<br /><br />One problem with this book is that the author tells the whole story from the standpoint of me, me, me. I understand how hard her life must have become in the wake of her husband's devastating accident, but I had a real problem with the fact that, according to the book, for the most part, the author parked her formerly active husband in the living room in front of the television like a potted plant and pretty much left him there.<br /><br />There is very little interaction described between the author and her disabled husband. The author goes on and on about how wonderful her husband's caretakers are, but treats the quadriplegic husband as a two dimensional burden. For example, Ms. Parker will describe in great detail some conversation or interaction she had with one of her husband's attendants, and then she throws in something like, \\"and we gave Ralph a sleeping pill, emptied his urine bag, put him to bed, and then [the attendant] took me upstairs and made love to me tenderly.\\" I am no prude, and I understand the woman has needs, but I found the whole thing horrifying and insensitive.<br /><br />She parks the husband in a hospital bed in theliving room, and then spends the next few years sharing a bed and sex life upstairs with his 60-year old care attendant. When the husband says he does not want to know how she satisfies herself sexually, she tells him anyway, saying telling him would make HER feel better. Who knows how the poor husband felt. He could hardly complain, since he is helpless without both the wife and the attendant.<br /><br />She says her old friends and life \\"dropped away,\\" after the accident, leaving as her only social life, an odd assortment of lovable misfits that took care of her husband. The book gives the impression that, if one is rendered disabled, their only social life is going to be with their ex-con, ex-drug addict hired attendant [who also services the author sexually for years] and assorted neighbors.<br /><br />I did not find the book uplifing. I found it completely depressing. Usually when I love a book, I am sad when I finish it. This one I was glad to put down. If you want an inspiring book by or about dealing with quadriplegia and its aftermath, I highly recommend \\"Eleven Seconds\\" by Travis Roy [the former hockey player]; \\"Still Me,\\" by Christopher Reeve; or \\"Miracles Happen\\" by Brooke and Jean Ellison.	2005-05-19

I initially thought the book too sappy, but I kept thinking about it, and coming back to read passages of it, and that's the sign of a great book.<br />I also saw Brooke on Larry King, and she was amazingly articulate, compassionate, smart and beautiful. It was not just that she was \\"inspirational\\" for all she had gone through: she was also incredibly intelligent [not surprising, given her Harvard education], and is using her enegies to do great things.<br />She spoke about her experiences in such a thoughtful way. I have since done some research and found articles Brooke has written on a web site dealing with disabilities.<br />I have read, and promptly forgotten, a lot of mediocre books, but this is one I'll remember, so change my review to a wholehearted recommedation.	2004-11-29

Like many of you, I loved this book as a child, but re-reading it in 2004, what jumped off the page to me was how much everyone smoked. <br /> <br />While Marie is recovering in the hospital from the birth, she lights a cigarette. When they take baby Karen to the doctor, the doctor lights a cigarette, and then offers the cigarette box to the Killileas. <br /> <br />I know this was in 1940, but still, it was disturbing, given that we now know smoking causes premature birth, and may well have led to Karen's CP.  <br /> <br />I would still recommend this inspiring book, but if I gave it to a child, I would have a talk with them about smoking first, since this family is supposed to be role models.	2004-10-13

I had read Lucy Grealy's own book, Autobiography of a Face, and it was interesting to read about Grealy's life from the perspective of her best frient, Patchett. I did find it weird that, while Patchett writes that her relationship with Grealy was the most important one in her life, I don't believe Grealy even mentioned Patchett in her own autobigraphy.    This book was beautifully written, and even though I know how it turns out [Grealy dies tragically, yet inevitably], I had to keep turning the pages to see how the story unfolded.    I have one correction to one of the reviews above: Lucy Grealy did not die of cancer. Her cancer never returned. She actually became a heroin addict, and it it believed that her mixing drugs and alcohol ultimately caused her death. Thus, I have to wonder if that review even read the book, or whether they got the \\"cancer\\" story from an inaccurate blurb on the Internet.    The topic of this book would lead one to believe it's a dull story of the friendship between two female writers; but for me, once I started reading, I could not put it down. I'd recommend it, especially as a nice change for people who usually read legal thrillers and romance novels.	2004-09-13

I have read many stories of \\"inspiring\\" people with spinal cord injuries, but never one as honest and emotionally open as this one. Roy shares not only the medical details of his injury, but his deepest feelings about what happened to him; and how he continues to deal with it on a day to day basis. <br /> <br />Instead of just giving uplifting blather about having a relentlessly positive attitude, he admits to bouts of self-pity; he talks about how other \\"well meaning\\" but patronizing people sometimes make him feel. It gave me a lot of insight into the difficult life of a quadriplegic, and definitely made me want to reach out more when I see someone in a wheelchair, and not to treat them as if they are invisible, which is often what happens in our society. <br /> <br />I had read another book called [I think], \\"Miracles Happen,\\" by Brooke Ellison, who was rendered a ventilator dependent quadriplegic at age 11, and went on to graduate from Harvard. While I found Ellison very inspiring, her sugar-coated, surface description of her life and emotions somehow left me cold. In contrast to that, Travis Roy lays it all out there: everything he was and is thinking and feeling, whether or not those thoughts and feelings were \\"admirable.\\" <br /> <br />He even talks about how awkward it is to be an \\"inspring\\" celebrity just by virtue of breaking his neck; and how he'd trade places any time with a normally abled anonymous person. <br /> <br />This is a fast read, and I would highly recommend it.	2004-09-13

For example, she does not describe exactly how far down her body she has sensations; she talks about being in a wheelchair, but never describes learning to move the wheelchair with breath control, and what her typical day is like.<br />She states she was in rehabilitation for 8 months, and that it was hard, but gives not a single description of what that rehabilitation actually consisted of. She talks about the three-hour ordeal of just getting ready in the morning but does not describe it much. She talks about her mother tending to her medical needs, but doesn't describe them.<br />I know it sounds like I want more &quot;gore,&quot; but really, one of the reasons you buy a book like this is to try to understand on a deep level what it is like to be in someone else's shoes, and I didn't get that feeling from this book. It gives a really surface description of an &quot;inspiring&quot; story, but I never really got to know who Brooke is from reading it. It does not even say how in the world this family of limited means afforded Harvard, and all the medical care.<br />Parts of the book seem cliche. <br />With that having been said, one cannot help but admire Brooke for her optimism and perseverence; and especially her Mom, who not only went with Brooke to all of her junior high school and high school classes; but also went with her for 4 years to Harvard, leaving her husband and other 2 kids in New York. <br />[Parenthetically, I wondered why in the world Medicaid or Social Security did not pay for nursing care to give her Mom a break, especially since Brooke's dad worked for Social Security for over 20 years and should have been able to find his way through the system!]<br />I would recommend this book for its inspiring story and tale of an amazing family, but if you like this sort of book, I would more strongly recommend, &quot;Tales from the Bed,&quot; by Jenifer Estess [who died of ALS, Lou Gherig's disease] and &quot;Autobiography of a Face,&quot; by the late Lucy Grealy, a detailed account of childhood cancer and the resulting disfigurement. Both are beautifully written, and much less sappy than this book.	2004-06-19

His barbs are sharp, but never mean-spirited, and every one of his accusations of inaccuracies by the right-wing media is backed up by statistics or direct quotes by the &quot;liars&quot; contradicting themselves.<br />A terrific book. I read it in just two sittings. Not only did I learn a lot about the issues; the book also gave me ammunition to use when Republican friends start spouting stuff about how Al Gore is a liar. I can now come back with why George Bush is much worse, and then spout off a bunch of examples. <br />Warning to Republicans: this may be a difficult read for you. But to those frustrated with the barrage of mean-spirited right-wing propaganda, this book will make you feel great!!!! Thanks, Al.	2003-12-18

I found this book well-written, nicely capturing the, &quot;life of quiet desperation&quot; led by the protagonist, Meg. The premise and execution of the book are interesting [is this boy, or is it not, her son Charlie; and if it's so clearly not, why is no one asking the hard questions to which only the real Charlie knows the answer; why no computer picture comparisons or DNA?]<br />The fact that everyone acts so normally, and no one is yelling, &quot;What's going on here,&quot; is strange; the whole family scene is strange and awkward, and, when all is said and done, did not really ring true to to me.<br />I was waiting for some revelation in the book that never came; and in the end, found it a quick and unsatisfying read.<br />For a fabulous family novel, I would recommend The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold. This book does not hold a candle to that one.	2003-05-08

I could not put down this book. Watching beautiful but somewhat emotionally immature Julie ruin, and ultimatelly lose, her life, is heartbreaking, but strangely fascinating. Glatt does a great job of setting up the murder by profiling the victim's parents, and her difficult childhood. The background information makes it easier to understand how such a beautiful woman who seemingly had everything [handsome successful husband; lovely home; adorable baby] would chuck it all for a not too attractive and impoverised Greek cruise line worker. Well, not 100% easy to understand.<br />While reading, I felt like screaming at the victim: don't go with him. What, are you crazy? But, of course, if you read the book description, you know exactly how the story will end. Knowing does not make the read any less gripping, which is the sign of a good writer.	2001-08-08

I got so engrossed in this great book, I literally read through the night, and realized at 6:00 a.m. it was getting light out. The writing is so immediate, I got a clear mental picture of the horror that was going on as these brave men endured the unimaginable.  I had heard of the Indianapolis tragedy, but many have not. <br />When this ship failed to arrive at its destination on time, after being sunk by the Japanese, it is through a series of inexcusable snafus that no one realizes they are missing, and they have to float helplessly in rafts, while one after another, they are eaten by sharks. The author did a fantasitic job researching the entire story so many years later. He spoke at length to some heroic survivors, and their families. <br />This book should be must reading in school history classes.  I can't recommend it enough. Just don't start reading it if you have somewhere you have to be soon. :-)	2001-08-04
US	51267531	R3HNBB30HQ89Y8	0786889608	783765194	Middle of Nowhere	Books	3	4	6	N	Y	Surprisingly slow-paced for a Pearson Book	The plot and characters in this book are great, but it would have been a lot better if the length was cut by about 100 pages. Just one chase sequence goes on for so many pages uneccesarily. The police are following a suspect on foot, and Pearson goes on and on with the suspect getting on a bus; off a bus; in a building; out of building; etc., while the police keep switching off chasing. Rather than being suspenseful, the story comes to a complete halt. This happens repeatedly througout the book.<br />This book just took too darn long to get where it's going. But there's also a lot to like. The recurring character of Lou Boldt is an interesting one, and his relationship to his fellow detective, Daphne Matthews, is interesting. The plot, in which Boldt is trying to solve the brutal attack on a fellow officer, whose neck was broken, is quite good. The attack took place during a &quot;Blue Flu&quot; and pits striking officers against working officers like Boldt. There are clues that suggest cops might have been involved in this and other attacks. The author does a good job of showing us how torn up Boldt is by the tension between him and his fellow officers.<br />I would recommend the book to avid Pearson and Boldt fans, but warn them they'll have to suffer through a lot of extraneous pages to get to the good stuff.	2001-07-31

Dunne's essays on the Simpson case were written as the trial progressed, and it was fun to read things like that there's no way, with this DNA evidence, that he could get acquitted!  Dunne's books are unique because he lets you know exactly what he is thinking; when he thinks a witness was lying, or a lawyer, or even a judge, was unethical, he lets them have it. That makes the book very satisfying [more so if, of course, you agree with his point of view.]<br />My quibble with the book, and it's a picky one, is the constant name-dropping, even when not necessary to the story. Sometimes Dunne comes off as someone with low social self-esteem, who tries to make himself more important by dropping the names of rich and famous he knows personally, particularly in the Simpson essays. On Virtually every page, he states something like, &quot;I was having dinner with movie mogul Marvin Davis, with so and so sitting at the next table, when so and so came up to me and said, &quot;Dominick . . ..&quot;  Other anectdotes are preceded by statements like, &quot;I was at a party for Mr. Big Shot famous movie producer, and schmoozing with Ms. Big Shot Movie Star, when the following incident occurred.&quot; It tends to get old after a while, particularly when I had never heard of some of the allegedly Big Shot people.<br /> It's a small quibble, though, because the book really does give you a front row seat into some of the more fascinating crimial trials in history; not just what went on in the courtroom, but also what was going on behind the scenes. Thus, by the time you are finished reading the book, you can forgive Dunne for throwing in so much self-important name-dropping, because he took us along for such a fascinating ride. I would recommend the book to all who are interested in the more tawdy criminal trials of our day.	2001-07-31

The book includes some information also discussed in &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; but also lots of interesting stories about the IMAX team's climb. It also has gorgeous pictures of the climb [although there appears not to have been a still camera at and near the very top, because presumably it wasn't working in such high altitude.] I could have done without the detailed descriptions of how an IMAX camera worked, but it's a small quibble, and probably necessary to the story. There is also a list in the back of statistics and names of people who have summitted, which is terrific for climbing afficianados like me. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of climbing and adventure books to add to their collection.	2001-07-16

He sees on a store video tape that one of the victims was grabbed from behind, the robber/murderer puts the gun to her left temple and fires, while holding her with his right hand. Not once in the 498 page book is there a discussion that the guy they are looking for is a lefty. The book ends, and the fact that his watch was on his right hand, and he shot someone in the head with his left, when they had absolutely no other clues to go on would seem huge. I was shouting at the book, \\"at least you can narrow down the suspect pool to lefties.\\"<br />Second, the killer is diabolically clever, evading capture for a long time by extremely intelligent means. Yet, the way he is ultimately found is such an incredibly obvious and stupid mistake, it was a total cheat to have the murderer screw up just to get a clue for the protagonist before the end of the book!<br />Also, maybe it's the trial lawyer in me that scrutinzes the details too much, but I also guessed who did it and why about 200 pages before this brilliant FBI agent figured it out [the big shocking revelation was not at all shocking to me.]<br />I am a big Connelly fan, and because his writing is so entertaining, I would still recommend the book; but it seemed that he was a bit lazy on this one. I would still recommend it as a fun read, but disagree with the people who think it was brilliantly plotted.	2001-07-02

I don't want to sound morbid, but when you buy a book about shark attacks, it should not take 93 pages for the first person to get eaten. Capuzzo spends an enormous amount of time describing buildings, clothing, towns. Every time a new character is introduced, the author has to go back a generation or two, with endless descriptions.<br />Because the setting is 1916, a time unfamiliar to many, it is understandable that Capuzzo has to set the stage for the drama, but endless description and exposition gets extremely tiresome. The shark attacks are described in a very compelling way, but the author also uses the tiresome strategy of teasing us by introducing some character who goes in swimming, but then does not get attacked, just like those murdered teenager movies, where the scary noise turns out to be the cat.<br />Also, the book claims to be extremely realistic, with no conversations recreated, but then the author tells us exactly where the shark was swimming, and what it was thinking! How is that realistic?<br />This book would have been a lot more compelling if it was about 150 pages shorter. It might have even made a better lengthy article, since there really wasn't enough to fill a whole book.<br />For those who like ocean-adventure-survival stories, I would recommend you read In Harm's Way, about the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, and the resulting shark attacks. Much better written. I couldn't put that one down.	2001-06-25

Why, then, can't he stop thinking about Bonnie Spencer, the ex-wife of the victim and the prime murder suspect?  The description of this plot on the cover sounded shmaltzy and stupid, but being an Isaacs fan, I read it, and highly recommend it. <br />Before long, you forget the author is a female, because the male narrator is so believable. The characters are well-drawn, even the minor &quot;supporting&quot; characters. My only quibble is that I figured out the &quot;shocking&quot; actual murderer looonnnggg before the last few pages when it is revealed.

This book was a real eye opener for me. It explains how the estrogens naturally found in a woman's body can't be patented, because they are just natural bodily hormones. Therefore, the drug giants who court all the doctors have no financial incentive to tout naturally occurring hormones. Instead, they push the horse estrogens, and other unnatural products, which cause side effects.<br />This book explains how a woman with a good doctor can get a pharmacy to mix a custom-blended natural hormone replacement with few, if any, side effects, because it's what's in your body already.<br />I took this book to my doctor who said of course he'd be happy to prescribe natural hormones as suggested in the book. Had I not brought it up, I, too would have been prescribed that horrible Premarin or Prempro, made from the urine of pregnant [and abused] mares.<br />I've spoken with other women over 45-50 who take the horse estrogen, Premarin [the name comes from PREgnant MARe's urINe], and they were shocked that there was an alternative their doctors had never bothered mentioning.  <br />Anyone interested in natural health should buy this must-read, and then discuss with your doctor.	2001-01-14

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery about the sabatoge of varous roller coasters around the country. At the same time Rachael, a fortyish investigator for the National Traffic Safety Board, is investigating several deaths on sabatoged roller coasters, Sam Garvey, a genius widower engineer, is designing and building the Jumper, an improbable roller coaster, where two cars going at the same time criss-cross in mid-air at a gap in the track, and are then go back on the track on the other side [an idea no sane insurance company would cover, but fun in the book].<br />Garvey and Rachael meet, and the sparks fly while they try to catch the saboteur, and to clear Garvey, who is apparently being framed as a suspect. The book is not too deep, and is best for a vacation beach read, but I'd highly recommend it. I read it as a respite after reading Wally Lamb's 900-page emotionally draining book, &quot;I Know This Much is True,&quot; which I loved.  Jumper was the perfect light  followup. I read it after reading an Amazon review.  It's a quick and fun mystery for those who enjoy this genre.	2000-11-18

I was initially skeptical about all of the glowing reviews of this book,and all of the hype surrounding its &quot;Oprah&quot; status, given my hatred of the overly schmaltzy Brigdes of Madison County; that, combined with the subject matter [mental illness and despair] initially delayed my reading of this book. I'm so glad I decided to read it. The story of protagonist Dominick's life history [as an emotionally abused child, whose identical twin develops schizophrenia, and is at that same time very much loved brother, and a horrible burden] is intertwined with the history of Dominick's horribly unlikeable grandfather, Domenico. Domenico's written &quot;autobiography,&quot; which Dominick is reading at the same time we are, alternates with both younger Dominick's life story, and what is happening in the &quot;present&quot; to him. Sound confusing? It would be in the hands of any other writer, but Wally Lamb masterfully interweaves the stories, going seamlessly back and forth in time, pulling it all together in a terrific ending.<br />Without giving too much away, Dominick never knew who his real father was; when the book opens, his grandfather and mother are both dead, his wife has left him, and his brother is on his way to a mental institution, not for the first time.  His only other living relative is his hated stepfather, who abused Dominick and his twin brother when they were young. <br />As Dominick reads the autobiography of his arrogant grandfather, also an abusive man, and reflects [along with the reader] back on his own hard life, he unwittingly learns lessons about his family history, and how to live with his mistakes, and to forgive others theirs.<br />The story is really one of heartbreak and despair, followed by eventual foregiveness and salvation, which might sound sappy, but is really wonderfully executed.  Take my advice, and give Wally Lamb's book a shot. You won't regret it.	2000-11-10

For some reason, it's fun to  see Ned Allen's high-style life fall apart, and then watch him try to hold  it together. One big quibble: Any time the protagonist or anyone else flew  somewhere (South or East or out of the Country) Kennedy would always  mention in the book that it was an American Airlines flight. Even a flight  to Cayman is on American Eagle. It was so distracting, at one point, for no  reason, Ned is asked, &quot;Are you flying Delta&quot; and he says,  &quot;no, American.&quot; I thought maybe the airline figured into the plot  later, but now, having finished the book, I'm wondering if Kennedy received  a stipend from the airline! <br />Otherwise, it was a quick, fun, page-turning  read, and ironically, I finished the book while flying an American flight  from Boston to LA, so maybe the subliminal messages worked!	2000-08-24

In this otherwise well-written book, I found some sloppy mistakes. First, one of the main characters is  color-blind: a fact mentioned several times. Yet, when he goes to visit a  patient's father, he notes that the father has the same mesmerizing blue  eyes as the patient. How would he know that if he were color  blind?<br />Elsewhere, a murder victim is being buried. She moved to L.A. from  St. Louis, and her parents live in St. Louis. Yet her funeral is in L.A.  Why would the parents bury her in a city where she has no  family?<br />Otherwise, this is a scary and fascinating read. I'd recommend  it, but I wish Passman would be more careful.	2000-08-01

This illustrated edition is worth the second purchase. The newly added photos, which Krakauer obtained from various  sources, incuding the cameras found on two dead climbers, and other members  of his expedition, give the book an added dimension.<br />I would highly  recommed that fans of climbing books, and of Into Thin Air, add this  terrific book to their collections.	2000-07-26

Kay's life is getting so depressing, it's getting progressively harder to read this series. They've  now killed off two of her love interests in a row [both in law  enforcement], which ranks her just below Sipowicz on NYPD Blue on the  unbelievable string of tragedies scale.<br />I still enjoyed this book, but  Black Notice was an appropriate name. Because the character is a coroner,  and there is so much death and tragedy, Cornwell needs to add at least some  reason for these characters [Kay, and her equally depressed neice, Lucy] to  want to go on living.<br />The book was good enough to recommend to Cornwell  fans, but I won't read her next book unless I am in a really upbeat,  resilient mood, so I won't feel like jumping off a bridge when I'm done!	2000-07-21

Junger keeps things  moving, seamlessly switching from the &quot;protagonist&quot; boat, the Andrea Gail, to other boats caught elsewhere in the same storm.<br />Junger's  unflinching description of what death by drowning must be like, and how it  is one of the worst ways to go, is chilling.  I know nothing about boats or  fishing, and have never been to Glouster; yet I could not put this book  down. <br />The cover will probably be changed to include George Clooney,  which I think would be inappropriate. Otherwise, I highly recommend this  book, even to folks who normally don't read non-fiction: It is so well  researched and written.  You can tell the author developed a genuine  affection for his subjects, and his lack of objectivity, which would  usually be a negative, makes for a much more involving read.	2000-07-21

This book shows how a moment of senselss  violence, which is usually given a brief amount of news coverage, actually  has a ripple effect that lasts a lifetime. A must-read.	2000-07-21

The plot was involving,  and the author gives the reader a real feel for the atmosphere of Boston  [where I have never been.]<br />In this book, there is no clear line between  who the bad guys are, and who the good guys are; there's a great deal of  moral ambiguity, something missing in most books in the   &quot;detective&quot; genre.<br />The protagonists are wonderfully developed  and realistic. I highly recommed Lehane, and particular this book, which is  his best to date.	2000-07-21

As this series progresses, I've noticed that the stories have become more socially relevant. I agree with other Amazon reviewers that V.I. taking so many  physical risks in her 40's is getting just plain stupid, but Paretsky's  writing and plotting is so good, it's hard to nit pick.  <br />One thing: I  started reading this series years ago. V.I. ages, but Golden Retreiver  Peppy must be about 20 years old by now. Similarly, Old Lottie and Mr.  Contreras must be about 100.<br />Nontheless, for fans of Sara Paretsky, her  books are too few, and too far between. This is one of her best.	2000-07-21

While it has some snippets of good advice for women [don't be hesitant, apologetic or act unsure], it also had some ridiculous  inconsistencies and stereotypes.<br />For example, Evans almost worships the  way men do things, and portrays all women as incompetent at business, given  their alleged stereotypical upbringing of playing with dolls and nurturing.  She reinforces every negative stereotype about women.  She discusses how  men are naturally confident, and suggests that women pretend they are  confident, even if they are not; however, in a later chapter, she says,  &quot;be yourself; be a woman; use your feminine wiles,&quot; because if  you pretend, they will see through you.  That's just not consistent  advice.<br />She says women must appear serious about their work; but then  later says it won't hurt your career to go off on the &quot;Mommy  track&quot; for a few years. That is simply unrealistic in most  companies.<br />In early chapters, she says women have to demand what they  feel they deserve in the workplace just like men; yet, at the end of the  book she contradicts this by grousing about how men can get away with  things we women can't [they are allowed to get angry and be rude, fat and  ugly; we absolutely cannot]. So which is it? Do we try to act like them; or  like women; hard to tell from this rambling and inconsistent  book.<br />Finally, the worst advice of all! She tells women they can  contribute more to society and their careers by trying to work their way up  in a large corporation, rather than leaving to start their own business, or  by getting more fulfilling work at a smaller employer. This is  preposterous. Even Ms. Evans is not at the top of the heap at CNN, and  probably never will be. Her book is to justify her own choices.<br />As a  woman who left a very successful career in a male-dominated field to start  her own very successful business, Iwould recommend to women looking for  career advice that, unless they want to spend their career working in the  middle of a giant corporation, and being an employee all their life, don't  bother reading this book.	2000-07-07

While reading it, it did seem that the author was portraying himself in the most positive light, and downplaying the roles of his team. However, it was not until  reading this fascinating book that I realized how the author of the  original Annapurna had manipulated the story to take full credit for the  climb.<br />Herzog became a national hero in France, while no one even  remembered the name of the climber [Lachenal] who accompanied Herzog to the  summit, and who sacrificed his fingers and toes to the ordeal, only to die  in obscurity. Nor does anyone remember the two other climbers who forfeited  their own chance to summit to save Herzog's life.<br />Roberts' s research  sets the record straight, not only on what really occurred during the  climbers' ordeal; he also meticulously researched how Herzog, the team's  leader, controlled access to the press, so that only his version would be  told for over 40 years.<br />In this new book, the other climbers, often  referred to interchabably in Herzog's book, emerge as individuals, each  with his own story. The real tragedy is that, other than Herzog, none of  the team lived to see this book be published.<br />This is a must-read for  fans of &quot;climbing&quot; literature.	2000-07-02

But closer up, Ridgeway describes in  fascinating detail, how the expedition dissolved into competing cliques,  and how selfishness and teamwork collided. There's even an extra-marital  love triangle. <br />While this book is not as much of a page-turner as Into  Thin Air, it is one of the finest mountaineering books out there; a must  read in this genre.	2000-06-30

In my opinion, this book received the Nobel Prize more for its subject matter  than for the actual quality of the book.<br />The characters of Sethe and the  ex-slave, Paul D., are wonderfully written, and when the book stayed with  the story of how they endured, and escaped from, slavery, it was  gripping.<br />However, every time the story shifted to the ghost of Sethe's  dead daughter haunting her, and the mother-sister-daughter squabbling, it  lost me.<br />The book left me hungry to read a long, well-written, historical  novel about slavery and its aftermath, sort of the African-American  equivalent of a Herman Wouk or James Michener novel. Until that is written,  I recommend Beloved because of its historical importance, but I found the  book disappointing after reading so many rave reviews.	2000-06-30

He has also led an amazing life. Therefore, I really  wanted to like this book.<br />The pictures are fantastic, but the problem  with this book is Scott's writing. He is terrible at conveying what it  really feels like to be way up in the freezing and isolated Himalaya, or  hanging from a vertical rock.<br />A great writer like Jon Krakaur or Joe  Simpson can spend pages explaining how their fingers were numb; their  bladders were full, but it was too cold to do anything about it; the wind  slammed the tent against their faces, etc., so you know what it really  feels to spend a shivering night up in the mountains. In contrast, Scott  will say, &quot;and so we spent the night on the mountain and it was really  cold. So, the next day.......&quot;  The writing is cold [no pun intended],  and rather boring.<br />For readers interesting in great mountaineering  writing, I would recommend Into Thin Air by Jon Krakaur; Touching the Void  by Joe Simpson and/or The Last Step by Rick Ridgeway, all well written.  They cover less geographical ground than Scott, but they are all great  reads.	2000-06-30

Joe Simpson's personal account of his &quot;near-death&quot; experience is written in a simple, yet eloquent style.<br />Cliches such as  &quot;inspiring&quot; and &quot;harrowing&quot; don't do this book justice.  It is a one of a kind read.  Into Thin Air is also a terrific climbing  book, but for me, Simpson's story was more personal and in a way, almost  spirutual.<br />Even though he comes across as an unbelievably brave hero, it  is evident that he is not trying to, which makes him seem all the more  heroic. I would recmmend this book for sportspeople and couch potatoes  alike.	2000-06-26

The book also made the  scientific information about dirt, insects and chemicals interesting,  seamlessly weaving the &quot;educational&quot; material into the terrific  and ultimately page-turning plot.<br />This was the first Deaver novel I have  read, and now I plan on getting them all [yes, through Amazon of course]  and reading them.
