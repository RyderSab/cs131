I also loved the organization of the novel - starting in the present with flash backs from time to time.  And I loved the calligraphy.  However, all the characters are very wooden and remind me of the stereotypical Japanese character, where you never know what they are thinking or why they do something.  While I could understand some of the reasons certain characters did certain things from the aspect of Japanese societal rules - such as why Hanako feared retribution by her husband - I think this really needs to be made clearer and explored further in order to be understood and appreciated by an international readership.  Otherwise the reader is just left wondering - \\"Why on earth would they do that?!\\".	2005-03-22

Another Amazon reviewer, Shanghai-vixen, who gives a damning review of the book here, actually has this book on her Shanghai book list.  For myself, who has been living in Tokyo for a number of years, I actually found it a breath of fresh air in revealing the complexities of what it is to be an Asian female in an Asian culture of today.  The protagonist may be a bit self-obsessed, but her acute observations of herself are also complimented by her acute observations of others and the surroundings.  The descriptions of the weather of the different seasons, the suffocating summers, the polluted rivers, the crowds, the landscape views, the contrast of the thinking between the older and younger generations, are very much what it can be like and highlighted the very claustrophobic yet changeable atmosphere of some cities in Asia.  As some other reviewers remarked, the translation, especially in the beginning was a bit strange, but did get better as the book progressed.   <br />	2005-03-07

Unfortunately, it also has a lot of contradictions which a sensible editor should have sorted out.  The book sets out 10 principles of why dieters will forever be losing the weight loss battle and explains how to relearn to listen, feel and feed our body's natural hunger.  This aspect of the book is great, and there are lots of scientific references to back them up.  However, while on the one hand telling you to trust your body to select the healthy food it needs, the authors spoil it all in the last chapter (principle 10) by then prescribing a healthy low-fat diet plan.  This seems totally out of place on a book purporting to teach you to eat intuitively.  As some other reviewers have said, dieters don't need another &quot;plan&quot; to follow.  Instead they need to learn how to survive without the prop of plans that forever fail them.  It seems the authors are themselves stuck in their category of &quot;careful eaters&quot; and can't let go.  But this is just criticism of a small part of the book.  I would recommend &quot;The Seven Secrets of Slim People&quot; by Vikki Hansen and Shawn Goodman in addition to this book to reinforce the good parts.	2003-09-08

I am a complete adult beginner with hardly any knowledge of music theory.  While I like the exercises and explanations in general, some things are too minimalist for me and I have had to ask people I know to explain things.  For example, after an explanation of the treble and bass clefs, followed by some exercises of how to play with both left and right hands at the same time, there is an exercise with four staffs.  The first staff  begins with a treble cleff and then there is a bass clef at the end of the staff.  There is no explanation about this sudden new presentation of staffs and clefs, although if one is musically clever enough you could perhaps guess.  I found out from a friend that this presentation just means effectively &quot;play the treble clef (with the right hand) and then switch and play the bass clef (with the left hand) from here&quot; as opposed to playing with left and right hands simultaneously.  Another thing I found a little too brief was the explanation of the major and minor keys.  I had to resort to another book I have on basic music theory to understand this.  I like the style of this book and will continue ploughing along with it, but if you are an absolute beginner like me and have no one to ask or no other books to rely on it may not be the best choice.	2003-07-17

Josef Lehvinne is of the old school of thinking, namely, he believes that only meisters should be teaching how to play music, although he grudgingly acknowledges that demand outstrips supply and American &quot;method&quot; teaching has reached acceptable standards.  I dread what he would think of me trying to teach myself.  I could make fun of his attitude, but in reality he is a perfectionist, and that is what it really takes to make an outstanding musician of any instrument.  Furthermore, he shares in a very readable style what is important when mastering the piano.  Even a beginner like me can appreciate the value of his very generous advice.  Every page has at least one or more important gems, and his style of writing is such that you are sure to remember them!	2003-07-17

Yet while the information on each card is great, I have a few complaints.  First of all, the quality of the box and the cards is basic and not particularly durable.  The box is made of light cardboard, and the cards are also made of fairly lightweight card paper.  For the price I expected better quality.  Another feature I don't like, but which seems to be the standard for Kanji cards, is that rather than turn over the card from left to right (or right to left) like a page, you turn it &quot;up and over&quot;. Any more complaints?  Yes, a little colour coding on the cards would be nice.  However, I do appreciate the effort put into creating these cards, and hopefully future editions will be more durable, more colourful and a little cheaper.	2003-07-11

Perhaps this is partly because I am not American and also because I don't know much about either the places the author mentions or most of the names he drops.  But I persevered, and am glad I did, because although I didn't get what I expected I did enjoy reading about the experiences of going to a music camp and the authors encounters, conversations and interviews with various amateur and professional musicians.

Eric Maisel has constructed an easy-to-follow step-by-step method to harness our unconscious in solving what seems in broad daylight to be the unsolvable.  He provides several typical case studies including work problems, artist's block and having a problem with a roommate.  Writing down and refining the key issues surrounding the problem and keeping a dream journal are recommended.  Solutions may not necessarily appear after the first night's sleep on it.  The whole process may take a few days or several months.  But once you get into the habit of sleep thinking it becomes easier.  This technique is very similar to various meditation techniques I have come across, but sleep thinking is a more comprehensive and constructive approach.  I believe it also provides more possibilities because you are not continuously consciously focused on the problem you are trying to solve.	2003-07-10

I especially got a lot out of reading the exerpts from other people about depression, creativity and the meaning of life.  Meaning is a difficult concept, and I think Eric Maisel makes a brave attempt to break it down and pull it apart from all directions.  However, towards the latter end of the book, I felt that trying to label everything with a &quot;meaning&quot; label, lost meaning for me.  Nevertheless, the main thing I got from this book is that there are a lot of people out there trying to make sense of their lives, artists or not, and finding ways that give us pleasure in creating things or admiring others' creation is one way to achieve this.  I feel the core message of this book is that when you feel depressed, identify it, accept it and find your own personal way out, whatever that may be, to deal with depression when and as it occurs  - which it undoubtedly will and on a regular basis for many of us.	2003-07-10

Those that come to mind include: Twelve Steps for Overeaters (L. Elisabeth), The Seven Secrets of Slim People (Vikki Hanson, Shawn Goodman), Fat is a Feminist Issue (Susie Orbach),  Feeding the Hungry Heart (Geneen Roth), The Goddess Diet (Larrian Gillespie), Intuitive Eating (Evelyne Tribole, Elyse Rech) etc.  Reading the other reviews, I can see there seem to be two main views  -  either 1) this book is great or 2) this book lacks something.  As someone with long-term eating problems (over 25-years' worth!), my advice to prospective readers/purchasers is this.  If you do not have a big issue with eating and/or being overweight, this may be the perfect book for you to get back on track.  But if you have had long-term eating problems, one book may not necessarily be enough, it may be better to read this as well as a selection of books on related topics and work slowly step by step in your own time and in your own way towards your goal. Becoming fit from within is a very personal issue.	2003-07-09

This is in contrast to other techniques which focus on concentrating on a specific object or image.  The book can broadly be categorized into three sections - introduction &amp; background, the practice itself, and application to daily life.  I found the earlier chapters a bit long-winded, but it is worth reading them to fully understand what this technique is and what it is not.  The instructions on how to practice and organize a regular meditation are exceptionally clear.  By regular practice of the breathing meditation we can become more aware of life - like moving into the slow lane - and as a result we can learn to appreciate what really matters in life.  We can become less greedy and selfish and can delight in the simple and natural things around us.  The latter part of the book explores how our lives will change and how to embrace an attitude of &quot;loving friendliness&quot; in all that we do and with all we come into contact with.  A great book for helping people to dissolve the stress in their lives and learn to live more meaningfully.	2003-03-07

Although I can sense an energy about people, I have never been able to see colours there.  Once I was at a dinner party and I couldn't fathom why something seemed very different about one of the other guests.  He died a couple of months later.  It was only after reading this book that I understood that I had picked up on his lack of aura.  Edgar Cayce encourages us to look at all the other little clues surrounding people, including the colours they choose to wear, in order to get an impression of the colour of their aura and offers some interpretation of various colours.  While some people may feel this book lacks substance and depth, the real message is that we each need to develop our own ability to read and interpret auras through our own intuitive faculties.	2003-03-06

So it was undoubtedly a surprise for him in the course of hypnotherapy on one client to find the client regressing to previous lives, and further to hear voices of &quot;masters&quot; from the spiritual realm giving information on the lessons of one's lives on earth. This kind of experience must have been fascinating and his account of it is wonderful -  as is the amazing progress his client makes through a number of regression sessions.  Since I am already a believer in reincarnation I did not get as much out of this book as &quot;Only Love is Real&quot;.

This book shows us that love is there always, and that we will be guided to it when the time is right for us.  Our life - or rather lives - on earth are for a specific learning purpose, and once we accept this, and that there are our families of soulmates either here on earth or above to help us always, we can be reassured that we are not alone ever.

To this end, I was not disappointed.  Doris Lessing explores the meaning of love, not just infatuation, but also the loves of friendship, marital love and brotherly love and the their incumbent duties, as well as the (ab)use of love for personal gain or entertainment.  It may be true, as some reviewers suggest, that people who have been untouched by love may not appreciate this book as much as those who have, but I think anyone interested in the meaning of love in all its aspects and across generations can get a lot out of reading this book.  The main criticism I have is that while the story itself is about the staging of a play, I found the characters in the book and the aspects of love they portray rather over-staged, too.  It is as if no character has been wasted in an attempt to explore the meaning of love, and this is a bit tiresome at times.  On the other hand, this may be the point - that all people are in some ways generating or responding to the love or lack of love around them.  One book I would recommend to readers of Love Again is Love Letters (an anthology) by Antonia Fraser.	2003-02-12

The reason I was considering it was mainly because of the ear acupuncture, which is often not covered in much detail in mainstream acupuncture books.  Anyway, about a year after looking at it (since it was always popping up when I was browsing), I took the plunge - and it was well worth it.<br />The book is paperback size and weighs about 280 g (10 oz), mainly due to the glossy high quality paper used.  The contents are extremely well organized and key information is presented clearly.  The illustrations and photos are excellent.  The introduction covers the body cun measurements.  Part I covers the 12 main meridians and the conception vessel (Ren mai), governing vessel (Du mai) and extra points.  For each meridian, all the points of the meridian are shown in one photo of a real human body, followed by detailed illustrations (showing bones, muscles and tendons), locations, actions, indications and needling of the major points.  There are also blue boxes containing extra tips for locating points or warnings about treatment.  Part II (50 pages) covering the ear is well done with reference to both the Chinese ear points and Nogier's ear points, including indications.  The locations of points (or areas) in this section are depicted on photos of real ears.  Part III (90 pages) on trigger points is equally well done.  The references indicate a wealth of acupuncture research and resources in German.  While this book may never become a recommended text in North America due to the already well-established texts available, it would be useful as a compact compendium for carrying around or as reference for both the student and practitioner.	2002-08-28

When I became interested in this topic more than 20 years ago, there were very few books around that did not have an \\"occult\\" or \\"other-worldly\\" tone to it, which I found off-putting.  It has been well worth the 20-year wait for a book like this, which deals with all aspects of being psychic from just that gut feeling to astral projection and written in a style that recognizes that these are very real intuitions/communications that a lot of people experience and that can be developed in each individual (although not all people may be able to develop all of the skills).  This is a remarkable book that packs in more than you can imagine on this vast topic - well worth buying.	2002-08-26

Not only are the contents inspiring, but the book itself is inspiring with its glossy feel, breathtaking photographs, and unique layout and design.  This is not a book to be rushed, rather savour each chapter one by one, taking the time to absorb and assimilate the guidance and thinking about the questions to work out your own problems and solutions to a more fulfilling life.  It is also a book to come back to again and again to help recentre ourselves when we need it.	2002-08-26

The book describes how to use the pendulum, using an gattuningh technique before each question, and provides troubleshooting hints, such as what to do and what it means if the pendulum does not move or if it just swings up and down instead of in a clockwise or anti-clockwise circle.  This is followed by some interesting ideas for using the pendulum using astrological charts and maps included in the book.  This is a fun book to learn about using the pendulum and dowsing.	2002-08-26

However, when I got home and started reading I found that in spite of the fascinating discussions on exploring one's palm to discover about oneself, I was disappointed by the lack of attention to detail for novices like myself. The basic palm shapes are not clearly presented, especially in terms of similarity and differences (I still do not know what mine is). Also different terms are often used for the same thing - the illustration on finger shapes has one finger labeled as \\"pointed\\" but is referred to as \\"conic\\" in the text. Furthermore, on closer examination some of the photos are out of focus and clearly should not have been included. On the other hand, the explanation of mounts, and major and minor lines, including variations, cannot be faulted. To sum up, this book would be useful for people who already know the basics of palm-reading (or have another book that covers this) and want to explore it further.	2002-08-26

This slim volume doesnft go into specifics of which path to follow, but through various exercises and examples of other people, leads you to discover what are your strengths and weaknesses.  Using this as a base and through meditation and further exercises you can find what feels right for you.  It does not necessarily mean finding the perfect job, but finding something in your life that fulfils you.  One point that is not often dealt with by other similar books is that finding meaning in our own lives should not be self-centered: we should also include some form of service to others.  Most of all, finding fulfillment does not mean we must all be high achievers and have some visible form of success.  We can each find meaning and fulfillment in our lives by living our soulfs purpose, which is unique to each and everyone and which in turn complements that of those around us.	2002-07-22

His message is that with open hearts and minds we can all achieve our dreams: we just need to trust in ourselves and our angel helpers, which should all be asked for help because there is an interconnection between their different roles and how they can help us.  Although I would have liked a bit more on this interconnectedness to help me understand it better, I enjoyed reading this book immensely and have gained a lot from it.	2002-07-19

The first part explains the meaning of karma with exercises to help us be aware of the message of each section and how it relates to the reader personally.  The second part is the 9-day gkarma clearingh plan, during which one should do devoid of any news or other media intrusion, eat one meal a day, not criticize, not communicate dissatisfaction, arise earlier and meditate, do something you do not want to do, do a selfless act, and observe our thoughts and actions.  This will help you attune to yourself to your karma and help you understand more clearly what is important to you and what you want to do with your life.<br />The author admits that the 9-day plan is nearly impossible to achieve, he himself only having done it once.  However, karma affects us each and every day.  If this book had addressed this in some depth in addition to the 9-day plan, it certainly would have earned five stars instead of three.	2002-07-19

Included is a list of 150 foods with their characteristics in terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).  The strength of this book lies in its explanation of how and why certain foods are healthy, not healthy or have certain effects.  After reading this book you will certainly think twice before reaching for a cup of coffee! I would, however, have liked to have seen a few examples of case studies of how to apply this valuable information.<br />One reviewer complained that the author self-promotes his other books.  That is true.  And the reason is that in his books Bob Flaws takes one topic within TCM and focuses on that to help readers new to this vast field appreciate one small aspect without being overwhelmed. And a natural consequence is to point the reader to books on related areas, which he has written about - and we should be very grateful for this because Bob Flaws is a very experienced and successful TCM practitioner. If I have one complaint about his books, it is that they seem a little dry. It would be nice to see a more user-friendly page design including a few illustrations here and there, with summaries as appropriate to help the reader consolidate the information in their heads.	2001-11-29

In this book he imparts the wisdom of a Chinese emperor on longevity, interpreting how it can be adapted to contemporary life.  This wisdom includes: appreciating different body needs for different stages of our life from childhood to old age; a regular lifestyle; modifying one's eating habits to include more grains, fruit and vegetables, and less meat; moderation in sex; ensuring sufficient but not too much rest and relaxation; self-massage exercises; good types of exercise; and the benefits of qi gong. The book is interspersed with excerpts from classical TCM literature as well as anecdotes from Bob Flaws personal clinical experience as an acupuncturist and herbalist.  Readers new to TCM may find some of the terminology in the book a bit strange, but all readers will undoubtedly want to make some changes to their lifestyle after reading it. A few suggestions on further reading would have brought this up to five stars.	2001-07-18

This is a collection of six well-documented articles on acupuncture including its history, practice in the West, analgesic effects, effects on the circulatory and immune systems, clinical effectiveness and adverse effects.  The authors include well-known practising acupuncturists some of whom are also MDs and affiliated to respected institutions such as Harvard Medical School. References to the articles include fairly recent research from publications such as the Lancet and the British Medical Journal, as well as Chinese literature. This book leaves little doubt that acupuncture stands up to both the test of time (some 3000 years) as well as modern rigorous scientific evaluation and is a beneficial complement to Western medicine.	2001-07-18

The book is prepared in a logical format in 11 &quot;phases&quot;, with a useful tree in the front flyleaf mapping out the organization. There are numerous exercises, which are clearly presented with answers included at the back of the book. I agree with the previous reviewer, but I do have a few quibbles. One is that a few exercises are extremely long - especially the first one, which could benefit from being a bit shorter. There is nothing more off-putting at the start of a book than to be asked to underline words in a passage that spreads over three pages. There are also a few odd errors in the answers (for example, in Ex 5 No.23 &quot;chickens&quot; is stated as being a common singular noun). One final point is that the book could be much improved by including a brief summary of rules at the end of each phase.  Nevertheless, apart from these minor problems, this book is definitely well worth the price for anyone wanting to learn or brush up their articles.	2001-07-17

Anne Stilman in &quot;Grammatically Correct&quot; has forged a new style in presenting information that is both enjoyable to read and provides the necessary rules.  This book literally breezes through the basics of spelling, punctuation, grammar and style that meets most of the needs of both writers and editors, yet at the same time holds itself up to the highest standards. The book itself is printed on high quality paper, and has a well-thought out layout and lots of examples, often using passages from well-known past and contemporary writers to illustrate a point. What a departure from all the other grammar or style books I've read!	2001-07-17

From choosing cutting tools to repairing a button hole, there are lots of tips to satisfy the beginner sewer. While I like the layout, which includes step-by-step instructions accompanied by photos, this little book could be vastly improved by adding a few more pictures to some of the tips to make them more clear. A couple of pictures could also be improved by better choice of colour (e.g. attaching a flat collar, which is a glaring yellow, and darning a hole, which is so well done you cannot see the example stitches clearly enough!). Nevertheless, overall it is a very useful book.	2001-07-16

Miriam Lee shares here insights into how to treat people in a busy acupuncture practice with minimal effort and maximum results, yet at the same time ensuring each patient is given quality time.  The author covers treatment of common health problems in the West such as depression, allergies, asthma, diabetes and obesity.  This she does using a core set of points which are mainly the 5 Shu (transport) points of the meridians and whose functions she explains with remarkable clarity. The book is a true inspiration for both beginning and experienced acupuncturists. Miriam Lee shows us not only how to heal patients, but also to consider our own intention as healers.	2001-07-16

But once you delve into the book and try some recipes, you realize what  value for money you have in this 600 page tome with literally a hundred  recipes to choose from for each course, all concise yet clearly explained.   This book is a wonderful resource for traditional North American cooking.  ranging from chowder to glazed ham to devil's food cake.	2000-09-08

I do a lot of proofreading in my job, and often  need to check correct usage of words including which preposition to use.  The inclusion of American and British spelling and pronunciation  differences is also invaluable.<br />What is especially useful for learners of  English in addition to the example sentences are: the notes on whether  certain words are formal, informal, colloquial or offensive; the tips on  politness; and the frequency of use of certain words in spoken or written  English.	2000-09-07

It  explains in easily understood language the imbalances in our bodies as a  consequence of past dieting (such as unstable blood sugar, yeast problems  and hormonal imbalances) and gives practical advice on how to rebalance  together with lots of resources.<br />However, there are a few things which  detract from an otherwise excellent book.  Rather than being split into  separate chapters in two different sections (resulting in a lot of  repetition), I would have preferred the symptoms and &quot;cures&quot; for  each topic to be in one chapter.  Also, in the text there are often vague  cross-references, such as &quot;see Chapter 4&quot;, when a simple page  number would be more helpful.<br />I was also surprised at the stand on soy.   Contrary to many recent articles reporting on the benefits of soy regarding  menopausal symptoms, Julia Ross opposes the use of soy.  For example, she  states that soy is responsible for menstrual disturbances in female  athletes.  But it is well known that female athletes have a high  muscle-to-fat ratio that can cause amenorrhea.  Julia Ross also states that  soy is probably responsible for the high rate of osteoporosis among  Japanese women since the Japanese are known to eat a lot of soy products.   However, no mention is made that dairy products (one of the best sources of  calcium) were only widely introduced in Japan in the post-war years of the  1950's.<br />In spite of my criticisms, this is an invaluable book to have on  your shelf if you are at all interested in finding a way to regain your  health and vitality.	2000-09-07

It encompasses everything you could  possible want to know about writing a scientific paper, posters, letters to  the editor, press releases, naming and numbering of chemical compounds,  conventions in chemistry, copyright, ethical issues as well as preparing an  effective oral presentation.  In addition, it has a clear and concise  section on grammar and punctuation, a very functional index, is up-to-date  including guidelines on how to cite references from Web sites, and provides  a useful bibliography after each chapter.  My job often involves  proofreading of abstracts or journal articles in various fields of science;  apart from a dictionary to check spelling, this is the resource I reach for  most.	2000-09-07
