When I finally did receive the book, I really tore into it.  I understand the path of darkness that the author is following, but at the same time can't there be a little more joy allowed?  Harry Potter has been turned into an angry, simpering, annoying twit in this installment.  Poor put upon Harry blows up at anything that glances his way.  I felt no sympathy for him at all throughout the book.  The long-awaited revelation comes in the last 30 pages or so - and even then it's no great surprise.  I'm sure that even thinking these thoughts is blasphemy, but I feel that the spirit of the first three books is being squashed.  There IS a place for darkness in the path that this character is on, but a little bit of light to complement the darkness would make it all a bit more spirited and enjoyable and not so monotonous and unrelenting.	2003-06-23
US	52983463	RKWEY1P2OQ2YK	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	2	10	17	N	N	Clockwork is right	I recently finished reading \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and quite frankly, I expected more.  Instead I found it to be quite predictable and ordinary.  The protagonist, Alex, is nothing more than a posing hooligan trying to fit in with his \\"crowd.\\"  His brand of violence is not really shocking in this, the 21st century.  He is merely a victim of peer pressure.  The only thing that sets him apart and adds a slight air of menace is that he embraces a lot of different types of violence - from rape to beatings to petty theft.  He is not a true believer of his own world, though, with his reluctance to pull off true crimes in the form of burglary and out-and-out murder. And his supposed shocking \\"rehabilitation\\" is simply aversion therapy.  The last \\"lost\\" chapter is neither a shocker nor a surprise and I really don't see any significance in it at all other than the numeric importance to the author.  Sort of a cop out - time heals all wounds... and psychopaths.  I will grant that the slang language invented by Burgess is a very good tool for transporting the reader into the \\"droog\\" world.  Otherwise, I don't see the fuss over this predictable novella.	2002-07-07

I also have the privilege to enjoy Peter Greene's writings every week (and live in fear that I may do something silly to appear in one!!). And on top of all that, I have also had the privilege to have been a student of the author.  Greene has a way of connecting with and bringing out that side of us that we all wish we could harness regularly.  A dry sense of realism mixed with a little of the absurd is a hallmark of his style.<br />As a student, I can remember looking forward to diagramming sentences in his class.... Yes, you heard correctly; LOOKING FORWARD TO DIAGRAMMING SENTENCES!!  Who could believe it?!  Witty, obscure, unique, hilarious - everyone just couldn't wait to see what he would come up with next.  From \\"pusillanimous cows\\" to \\"polka-dotted thingummies,\\" we ate it all up.  He taught that writing was not something to be afraid of... it was something to be embraced, a form of artwork and expressionism.  He taught satire and cynicism, optimisim and reality.<br />You can see his connection with language, it is both symbiotic and honest.  Greene is an Amazon Top 1000 Reviewer, so you may have already sampled his brand of humor and sense of society.  If you haven't, please look him up.  What you read is what you get.  The person truly is represented by his written \\"voice.\\"<br />A deeply personal work, this book is a collection of essays written about and for our community.  And when I say community, I include not only Venango County, but the entire world.  One tale can bring you to tears and the next can enrage you.  Read about family foibles, add in some twisted humor, and you'll be laughing in the aisles before you know it.  Everyone can relate to that big-time, \\"community-clueless\\" business in town or the need to recognize the heroes in your life or the death and loss of a mentor or the silliness of your own family.<br />These essays are writings that appeal to all peoples and all personalities and all sensibilities.  Please do not miss a chance to learn a little about Peter and all of us that make up these Venango Tales. Who knows... you may find that a little of yourself resides in Venango too.ities and all sensibilities.

If the length doesn't frighten you away, the details may.  Full of techno-talk, crossing generations, and incredible attention to precision, it was a little tiring at times.  There was a lot to keep track of and I felt that perhaps the two generations could have been split into two different novels to fully explore each set of protagonists and give them their own forums.  However, Stephenson definitely has something here and it's definitely fascinating and captivating.  Be sure to leave plenty of open time in you schedule for this one!	2002-02-22
US	52983463	RVQ8PIUZDDREE	1559361441	1086387	The Mammary Plays: Two Plays	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Two are better than one	This volume of two Paula Vogel plays is a very fascinating and valuable work.  How I Learned to Drive deals with a taboo topic in literature and in most of society - familial sexual abuse.  The lives of Li'l Bit and her Uncle Peck are displayed with a coy frankness that warrants a couple of reads to more fully understand.  As the story unfolds, the readers find themselves flopping between one character and the other.  You're never really sure who is abusing who.<br />The Mineola Twins is a very fine social satire of alternate lifestyles and obsession with power.  The quirkiness of the characters and some of the absurd situations provide an extremely insightful and amusing view on Boomerism and society's interest in appearances.<br />Both plays are great reads - especially when taken in this one-two punch of a book.  And, if you have a chance to see them on the stage, don't miss out.	2002-01-31

This was in her personal library and when I'd visit we would always pull it out and make at least one of the figures in the book.  She had already managed to do nearly every figure but she was patient and I would try my best to keep up.  When she died, I looked for the book but it had mysteriously disappeared.  I saw that it was back in print and I snatched a copy up right away.  This is the best folding book that I have ever run across.  It has models that range from the very simple to the VERY difficult.  You can fold out of this book for a lifetime and never fail to learn something or see something new.  A great book... grab it while you can and fold your heart out!	2002-01-20

Alleyn is Ngaio Marsh's &quot;handsome&quot; creation who went on to star in over 30 novels and short stories.  Marsh has often been overlooked in the mystery genre, but in my opinion she is one of the very best.  Her wit, characters, and tight story-telling make all of her books very enjoyable to read.  The murder may seem to be a little difficult to solve yourself, but as you get used to Marsh's tools and style, you quickly catch on and start to think like her hero.  I highly recommend this book as a great introduction to Marsh's wonderful world.	2002-01-14

The story begins with a house party and a clutch of very unique individuals... of course, murder can't be far behind.  It is true that Inspector Alleyn doesn't enter the story until halfway through the book, but that is really incidental.  The characters are fascinating studies of human folly and they more than carry the story until Alleyn shows up.  Aubrey Mandrake, a guest at the house party, plays a &quot;Dr. Watson&quot;-ish character and is himself quite engaging.  This book is a must read for its quirkiness and it's wit.  A great Marsh mystery.	2002-01-14

Marsh is know best for her creation of the &quot;handsome inspector,&quot; Roderick Alleyn.  This volume presents previously unpublished works, &quot;lost&quot; works, and Marsh's own account of the creation of her famous detective.  Marsh's wit really shines in this collection of work and you don't have to be a rabid Marsh fan to enjoy it.  I recommend this book highly.	2002-01-13

This simple book carries a beautiful message about the search for fullfillment.  Don't let the label of &quot;children's book&quot; turn you away... The Missing Piece and it's sequel The Missing Piece Meets The Big O are brilliant books dealing with this journey we call life.  Enchanting and moving.	2002-01-13

It's not a gory thriller and it's not a deep psychological thriller.  What it is is an engaging tale of a psychic investigator trying to sort out the many ghosts - both earthly and unearthly? - haunting Paradine Hall.  Paul Gallico has a magic to his writing and it's very apparent here.  The characters are engaging, infuriating, and every emotion in between.  This is a great read if you're looking for something enjoyable yet with a little suspense and mystery.  Wonderful tale.	2002-01-13

My best friend called me one day and told me about this book and how incredible it was and how moving and riveting and how it was the best book I would ever read.  The amazing part of this is that my best friend is a heterosexual male.  I borrowed his copy and devoured the book in an evening.  He was right.  This is one of the best books I have ever read or ever will read.<br />Eve Ensler interviewed hundreds of women and reported and interpreted their stories, their thoughts, their beliefs, their souls, their fears, and their strengths.  She deals with rape, shame, masturbation, childbirth, and many other topics.  The wonderful thing is that she deals with these sensitive areas with humor, grace, understanding, and empathy.  This is a work of celebration - celebration of women, celebration of survival, celebration of life, celebration of the vagina.	2002-01-11

I first saw Kathy and Mo perform &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; on a TV special.  Of course it was slightly edited but it was still brilliant nontheless.  I kept trying to tell my friends about this show but something always managed to get lost in the translation.  Finally, I found this script and I immdiately snatched it up.  This is an amazing two-woman show concerning relationships, women, and life.  This is a great piece and you should also try to catch it on video.  There aren't enough strong female writers/performers out there, but these are definitely two of the best.	2002-01-11

I eagerly grabbed &quot;Necessary Targets&quot; thinking it would have the same emotional impact as one of her previous monologues about the horrible acts performed against women in war.  I hate to admit it, but I was very disappointed in &quot;Necessary Targets.&quot;  Until the last 15 pages of the play, I was unable to really find a connection with any of the women portrayed.  I tried again and again and even felt guilty for feeling nothing.  I would still recommend this play for the overall message Ensler presents and the play's themes.  It is educational and eye-opening concerning the horrors of war that no one likes to talk about.  Please, also consider picking up a copy of &quot;The Vagina Monologues,&quot; by far Ensler's best work to date.  You won't regret it.	2002-01-07

This book, however, is as far from British mystery as can be.... and yet I loved it.  Perhaps a new genre can be started by Eliot Pattison - the educational mystery.  This book is rich in Tibet and Bhuddist lore, rites, and beliefs.  The main character is an imprisoned former investigator who has been called upon to investigate the discovery of a headless corpse.  What follows is brilliant story-telling and an amazing exploration of philosophy and religion.  The characters are full and fleshed out - avoiding any sort of attachment or being unable to sympathize with the characters is practically impossible.  I was very pleased to hear that Pattison is publishing another book featuring the continuing journey of Inspector Shan Tao Yin.  An excellent read and incredibly thought provoking and educational.	2002-01-02

Marvelous characters and a great mystery make this one of Marsh's best.  The character of Troy Alleyn, a respected portrait painter, starts off the tale never expecting to be plunged into intrigue.  She more than manages to hold her own until her husband is called in to solve the case.  Quirky players, a little twisted holiday spirit, and the standard Ngaio Marsh wit make this book stellar.  A must read and a great first book for Marsh newcomers.	2001-12-31

They use the art work to reveal parts of their characters that they would otherwise never reveal to each other and possibly never admit to themselves.  A definite must for anyone's personal library and should definitely be seen on the stage if possible.	2001-12-27

The Diaries of Adam &amp; Eve is an incredible representation of both sides of Mark Twain.  The cynical side that most people seem to know, as well as a softer side that has largely been kept hidden.<br />From the unflinching stubborn &quot;maleness&quot; of Adam to the innocent yet knowing Eve, this book is an amazing testement of Twain's love for his ailing wife.  It was her persuasion that led him to write the sweetly naive character of Eve.  The gentleness of the work is very touching and may be a surprise for people who think that Twain was just a tetchy grown-up Tom Sawyer.  Adam and Eve both have equal say in various &quot;experiments&quot; in their new world and their wonderful differing interpretations of shared events make the characters pop off of the page and into your soul.<br />I would also recommend the audio version of this book as read by Mandy Patinkin, Betty Buckley, and Walter Cronkite.  The true musical nature of the text and the spirit of Twain's words really come to life in a spoken format and may move you to tears.	2001-12-27

The play deals with the relationship between two actors - one older and one younger.  Occasionally the dialogue between the two is mildly interesting, but more often than not it is tedious and boring.  The scenes are short and virtually interchangable with no real depth of character.

I admit that I had never heard of Harry Potter until the huge fuss over the release of the fourth book.  I didn't buy into the hype until a friend of mine dragged me to the movie... I admit that I became a Harry believer after the first 10 minutes of the film and wanted more.  I immediately asked to borrow her books and read all four over the next two days.  After reading her set, I decided that I had to have my own copies.<br />The Harry Potter books are wonderfully imaginative and great for children of all ages (I myself am a 31 year old child!!)  I loved being taken out of the real world and submersed in a world of fantasy and magic.  Some say the stories and events are derivative of other classic &quot;good vs. evil&quot; stories; I don't happen to feel that way.  The attention to detail of both the Muggle (non-magic folks) and the Wizard worlds is staggering and fascinating and unique.  The J.K. Rowling style is also very refreshing and accesible to everyone even with the immense attention to specifics and details.<br />These books are great and I highly recommend them.  They are so unassuming and pleasant and can teach kids a lot about acceptance, forgiveness, and the true meaning of goodness.	2001-12-27
