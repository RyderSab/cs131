Joiry's lady glared back at him from between her captors, wild red hair tousled, wild lion-yellow eyes ablaze.<br /><br />'God curse you!\\" snarled the lady of Joiry between clenched teeth.  'God blast your black heart!'\\"<br /><br />In such fashion did Jirel of Joiry, the first female protagonist in the genre now defined as sword-and-sorcery, explode from the pulp pages of Weird Tales in October of 1934.  The story, \\"Black God's Kiss,\\" is the first and finest of the five collected in this book.  (The five are essentially the sum of Jirel's legend.  A sixth, \\"Quest of the Starstone,\\" was written to combine Jirel with Ms. Moore's other famous lead, space outlaw Northwest Smith, and is not included here.)<br /><br />\\"Black God's Kiss\\" establishes the tone and theme of Jirel's legend, as well as the basic plot for each tale: she ventures to a strange and/or dark otherworld and, through her spiritual and emotional willpower, manages to survive, gaining not treasure but self-knowledge.  A curious and noteworthy detail: though an expert swordsman, Jirel does not fight a single duel throughout the tales.  Rather, she herself is the sword wielded against sorcery.  (\\"The face above her mail might not have been fair in a woman's head-dress, but in the steel setting of her armor it had a biting, sword-edge beauty as keen as the flash of blades.\\")<br /><br />Ms. Moore's writing is, on the whole, transparent and clean.  It does suffer from some of the tendencies common among other writers of the time (longer descriptions than necessary; multiple adverbs; an unhealthy fondness for abstract words--gulfs, vastness, fathomless, etc.).  More detail about Jirel as a character--precious little is mentioned of her parentage, childhood, and the nature of her fiefdom--would have been welcome, too.  (Then again, the heroine can be said to spring newly forged into the stories' setting--she simply is what she is.)  Many of the otherwordly descriptions are vivid and haunting, even by modern fantasy standards.  Her willingness not to spoon-feed the reader the precise nature of the powers Jirel encounters (e.g. the light-devil in \\"Kiss\\" and the witch in \\"The Dark Land\\") is also appreciated.<br /><br />Although \\"Kiss\\" is likely the only one of the five that would be published by a professional magazine today, this is an easily read and worthwhile collection for the serious fantasy fan--and \\"Kiss\\" is a must-read.

For whatever reason, this volume includes stories published in 2002-03, so it feels a bit dated.  Nonetheless, it contains several gems:<br /><br />* The Mask of the Rex, Richard Bowes: elegaic display of third-person-omniscient craftsmanship; possibly the most well-written story in the collection--it leads off and sets a high standard for the rest to live up to in a reader's eyes (and most don't)<br /><br />* Lambing Season, Molly Gloss: vivid narrative of no-nonsense Westerner's encounter with an exploring alien; excellent sense of place and characterization; poignant<br /><br />*Of a Sweet Slow Dance ..., Adam-Troy Castro: incandescent, stirring account of an outsider's visit to a place where life alternates, literally, between nine days of heaven and one of hell<br /><br />* The Empire of Ice Cream, Jeffrey Ford: Ford's work only continues to impress; in this case, he presents the autobiography of a young man blessed or cursed by the sense-melding condition of synesthesia<br /><br />I could see how most of the others won over fellow writers; however, for the 'usual' fan of speculative fiction, this would be a collection worth checking out from the library before purchasing new.  (I won't name names, but some of the stories here simply weren't very accessible or beautifully written--and one, a winner no less!, has absolutely *no* fantasy or sci-fi elements at all.)  A collection of essays is also valuable for the serious follower of spec-fic.<br /><br />An uneven collection worth three stars--but the three it merits are bright indeed.	2005-07-05

Adapting that main plotline from *Willow*, Madeline Howard's first novel *The Hidden Stars* further combines several Tolkien-esque elements (wondrously dexterous elves/fey; vastly powerful wizards; not nine but twelve misshapen servants of the villain) to create an initially promising but unfortunately disappointing fantasy experience.<br /><br />All or almost all fantasy plots have been explored time and again.  What matters is the execution, and that's where this story falls short.  It opens with the birth of the promised child and her disappearance (or death) in a cataclysmic battle between a wizard and the empress's servants.  It then moves twenty years forward, to a time when the promised one has reportedly been sighted in a distant land.  The good forces dispatch a small company to find her, racing, of course, against the evil forces.<br /><br />A core problem is that, in the opening section, it's never shown how the empress became so powerful or why she's evil.  We're simply to assume she is both.  Echoes of this problem continue throughout (perhaps because of the strange viewpoint shifts--a main character is not well established).  In the way of characterization, telling is often preferred to showing, perhaps because there's little of depth to show.  In comparison with the characters from Martin's *A Game of Thrones* or any of Guy Gavriel Kay's novels, these are quite bland and stereotypical.  (The wizards are calm and wise; the young heroine determined yet self-questioning; the half-elven prince amazingly agile and quick-witted.)  The book's cover is perhaps ironically telling: no characters shown, just a generic sea-serpent attack.  Inexplicably, too, there is no map of the fantasy world, which is almost necessary, given the importance of travel.  However, one can be found at the author's website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The above disappointments are only magnified by Howard's writing ability.  She can truly write well, often with wonderful clarity and beauty.  However, she is perhaps a bit too enchanted with the high-fantasy storyteller's voice and employs far too many adjectives, adverbs, and redundant descriptions.  (She also changes tense in descriptions of places and is prone to telling instead of showing character behavior and feeling.)  *Stars* is the first of a projected trilogy.

Please take this for what it's worth: one person's opinion.  I'm a 28-32 year-old man who enjoys fantasy and literary fiction.  Fantasy authors I admire include Guy Gavriel Kay, George Martin, Robin Hobb, Steven Brust and Patricia McKillip.  I offer this for the benefit of those with similar tastes.<br /><br />I simply could not finish this book (and have already donated it to my public library).  It begins adequately and has decent world-building, but about halfway in (once the strong-yet-unremarkable protagonist, Kallista, and company start toward the capital city) it sinks into a nauseating quagmire of romantic pseudo-plots and issues.  The scenes are poorly paced, and for no apparent reason (other than weak attempts at creating tension), chapters begin and end in the middle of the same scene.  Most glaringly, the writing is at best pedestrian and, at its worst, contains some of the most awful sentences I can recall.<br /><br />An example from p. 220: \\"[His] hips bucked, his tip just nudging her entrance, and they both hissed with the feel of it.\\"  (Note that neither character being described is a snake-person.  Also, how could neither the author nor editor chuckle whenever an agent of the 'bad' sect, The Order of the Barbed Rose, refers to his boss as the 'Master Barb'?)<br /><br />If you enjoy romances and don't mind fantastical elements, then this may be a decent library loan or airplane book.  However, if you're looking for a fantasy adventure, a good character-driven story, or something well-written, then I strongly recommend avoiding it.<br /><br />One regretful star.	2005-04-13

Like a mystified and riderless horse, Sharon Shinn's fantasy novel \\"Mystic & Rider\\" gallops to the point of fatigue and frustration.  This conclusion is especially unfortunate in light of the excellent opening chapter.  But buyer beware: the tension and excitement rarely increase from that point, and the last of the 440 pages brings us little closer to some kind of resolution or revelation than the first.  Rather, the *entire* novel is simply a prologue for the rest of the series.<br /><br />The novel's plot is perfectly plain.  A band of adventurers is dispatched by the king to investigate troubling rumors in the southern provinces.  Shinn's writing is usually transparent and, in some places, strikingly good.  Her characters are likable if on the bland side, and the magic system is passable. (Some people are born as \\"mystics\\" with useful, though usually minor, powers--not unlike mutants in the X-Men comics.)  But neither the writing nor characterization overcome the lack of focus and tension in the story itself.  To elaborate (and not be thought unfair), I'll discuss my specific problems with the story after the next two paragraphs.  Please stop there to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />In sum, I really liked the first chapter or so, and Shinn's writing kept me chasing this riderless horse of a novel until the unsatisfying end.  It may be that, now that the set-up for the fantasy kingdom is complete, this turns out to be a wonderful series (because this could have been a great book with a stronger plot and focus).  However, I'll wait and see before spending any more time or money on the chase.<br /><br />Recommended as a library loan for die-hard readers of fantasy.  Two-and-a-half disappointing stars.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT* (PLOT DETAILS INCLUDED)<br /><br />*Most genre novels follow a pattern of rising action, climax and resolution.  (The Fellowship journeys toward Mordor; it splits and the situation darkens as Frodo struggles toward Mount Doom; the characters reunite in the aftermath, and loose ends are bound.)  I'm all for creativity, change, and other advancements of genius that limit cookie-cutter tales; however, there's a reason why the pattern of rising action is the standard: it makes good stories; it's logical; it works.<br />*By contrast, Mystic is entirely episodic.  On the plus side, I've never read a fantasy novel with this wandering feel before.  On the minus side, I realize there's a reason why.  (See above.)  What you have here is a company setting out with a goal, yes, but an unfocused one: see what's out there and gather information.  So there's no tension or increasingly difficult series of obstacles or increasing political or relational entanglements.  Rather, the company meets a different problem in each spot along the way.  A series of episodes results, and the chapter titles could be listed accordingly:  They rescue a mystic boy from slavery.  They find slain mystics.  They endure a snowstorm.  They save a village from a strange predator.  They help deliver a mystic baby.  And so on--and the tension never intensifies because it's as if they're not staying in the same story.<br />*What's even more maddening: early on, they've mostly gathered the information the king will need.  However, they just keep wandering in and out of trouble, just to get a bit more.  They meet two potentially interesting villains along the way, but just as quickly, they leave them behind ....  (Nor do they consider sending someone to report back to the king in case the others are killed or captured.  Also, their rescue of Tayse from the convent was absurdly easy: (1) the leader trots out her defenseless novices to meet this dangerous company, instead of surrounding them with armed soldiers; (2) a raelynx can dodge whole volleys of missiles?; (3) why not shoot the companions instead of the raelynx?  Better yet, use some foresight and cunning and hurl glass globes of powdered moonstone at their mystics to disable them.)<br />*As a final note, the main character, Senneth, is decent: a powerful mystic (with a mysterious past, of course) who is also a competent swordswoman.  However, how can the reader even begin to worry about her or the others when, time and again, she's described as the most powerful mystic in the world?  In fact, no one even comes close to her--she can even burn down cities!

(At least, I think he has.  If not, one can add delusional to the above list.)  With such an assortment of issues, any move Alan makes is almost certain to produce turmoil and/or hilarity; and *Wake Up, Sir!* brims with both as Alan narrates a madcap week during which he (and Jeeves) leave the relatively safe but confining home of his aunt and uncle and arrive at a prestigious artists' colony whose denizens are almost as cracked-up as he is.<br /><br />This is the first of Mr. Ames's books that I've read, and I was impressed by his clear, brisk style and intelligent, observant, off-beat sense of humor.  (I recently read Michael Chabon's *Wonder Boys*, another first-person account of a short but eventful period in the life of a writer-addict; and although Mr. Ames is not the \\"stylist\\" Mr. Chabon is--though perhaps the former isn't aspiring to \\"style\\"--*Wake Up, Sir!* drew many, many more smiles and laughs from me than *Wonder Boys*.)  I would love to give this book five stars; however, the simple fact is that it ultimately proves to be a series of sketches and vignettes rather than a completed story of change (either personal growth or ruin) in the face of conflict (here, a man versus himself).  The plot is more or less episodic and concludes ... well, it doesn't, really.  Is Mr. Ames secreted in a colony even now, diligently typing up a sequel?  One could hope so.<br /><br />The bottom line: come along for a fast, bumpy ride with Alan (and Jeeves) if you dare.  You'll probably enjoy it, but don't expect a life-changing or enlightening experience.  I have absolutely no qualms about recommending this as a library loan, but I'd hesitate before purchasing it brand new.  Four impressive but slightly disappointing stars.	2005-02-13

But Tristran isn't the only one who seeks the star, and the star itself is much more than he imagined ...<br /><br />Gaiman weaves a quickly paced, beautifully structured adult fairy tale--'adult' because it doesn't neglect the human experiences of sex, death and time.  His language is that of the gifted storyteller--clear, concise and lyrical, resonant with mythic lore and archetypes.  I highly recommend this book (even as a new purchase) for fans of fantasy, fairy tales, mythology, and/or romance, as well as for those who simply enjoy a well-told tale.<br /><br />It would be a disservice to an interested reader to make this review any longer.

He's been 'working' on his fourth novel, \\"Wonder Boys\\", for over seven years, producing 2,600 pages but not quite reaching the halfway point of his outline.  Over the course of one weekend, at his college's annual \\"WordFest\\" literary gala, his world finally begins imploding beneath the combined pressure of his failing marriage, his editor, his lover, and his students (one worries him, one wants him).  Close encounters with a transvestite, a tuba, and a boa constrictor do little to ease his predicament.<br /><br />As in his debut, *The Mysteries of Pittsburgh*, Chabon employs a sardonic, first-person narration and academic ('town and gown') setting (still Pittsburgh) to create an unpredictable story colored with brilliant but troubled characters, hetero- and homosexual lustings, and prevalent substance abuse.  He again proves himself as an absurdly gifted writer with a superhuman vocabulary and ability to select from that embarrassment of riches the precise bon mots to enliven and enrich Grady's narrative.  It's the effortless effervescence of his storytelling that captivates and draws the reader along, since--although the set-up for Grady's calamitous weekend is excellent--the unfolding structure of the novel proves uneven.  (And Chabon does perhaps grow too fond of uncommon words and allusions, especially with regard to furniture and fashion.)  In particular, the visit with Grady's wife and Jewish/Korean in-laws for the Passover meal is far too long and detailed, especially since none of the characters or related issues reappear once he leaves.  (In this aspect, as with *Mysteries*, a more comprehensive resolution of each plot-thread would have been welcome.)<br /><br />Overall, *Wonder Boys* is a brisk, light, 'literary' read with a handful of laugh-out-loud moments and genuine insights into human relationships.  But until the very end, Grady proves a passive protagonist, battered every which way by his acquaintances' escapades and his pot addiction; and (perhaps as an effect of the first-person narration) we don't come to understand or identify with the supporting characters as well as we should.<br /><br />A good, entertaining read--but not a great one.

Because of its scope, it's also a hard book to review.  The word \\"epic\\" has been thrown around to describe it, and perhaps it's an appropriate one: the book displays both the strengths and weaknesses of a fantasy tale that spans centuries and planes of existence.<br /><br />The strengths:  Erikson displays a prodigious imagination and broadly constructed world; GOTM is indeed a good example of world-building.  Some aspects of his magic system and assortment of enchanted objects feel fresh, as does the creation of a city illuminated by natural gas.<br /><br />The weaknesses: As might be expected with a new novelist, Erikson's storytelling ability lags behind his imagination.  The most glaring problem is that he can't seem to decide whether to tell the story from multiple, limited points of view (as George Martin does so well in \\"A Game of Thrones\\") or from an omniscient perspective.  More often than not, he seems to settle for the latter--which has the consequence of distancing the reader from the characters.  With so many characters in play, this proves to be a nearly fatal flaw.  I found it incredibly difficult to relate to any of the characters; the soliders and assassins blurred together, and few motivations and biographies came to light.  Often, simple clarity--where are they now?  is this before or after that?--was lacking and jerked me right out of the story.<br /><br />Speaking of, there's much less actual story than the book's density would lead you to believe.  An empire is trying to conquer a wealthy city on another continent, and a broad array of warriors, assassins, sorcerers, politicans, and--most intrusively--gods factor into the conflict, plotting and scheming away.  Yet, for all the surface action, the shallow characterization mentioned above never quite pulled me in and inspired me to care about the story.  I often felt as if I were reading an incredibly detailed, turn-by-turn account of an intense and long-running Dungeons & Dragons campaign--something intimidating and inaccessible to outsiders, with minimal emotional payoff.  Some will praise GOTM for 'allowing' the reader to figure out some things for him or herself, and that can certainly be a valid praise for a book (e.g. for \\"The Briar King\\" by Greg Keyes or anything by Patricia McKillip).  In this case, though, the lack of explanation and clarity seemed less than intentional on the author's part.  (And a final, minor irritation: though Stephen Youll's cover is eyecatching, I have no idea how it relates to the story or who the two warriors are supposed to be.  The title is tangential, as well.  Such is marketing, I guess, in this age of ten-plus book trilogies ...)<br /><br />In a nutshell, GOTM was tolerable.  And to be fair to Mr. Erikson, it was first published in England in 1999, and the standards for the genre may have changed in the past five years.  However, this note from Terry Brooks in \\"The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference\\" may have proved instructive: \\"The temptation to free-fall through a story chock full of incredible images and wondrous beings can be irresistible--but, when not resisted, almost invariably disastrous.\\"<br /><br />GOTM isn't disastrous, but I can't recommend buying it or committing to another nine servings.

The majority of it is a wonderful read; unfortunately, it loses its freshness and momentum toward the end and fizzles to an abrupt, unsatisfying conclusion.  My take on the good and the not-so good:<br />The Good<br />** Fresh, detailed setting and magic system.  The story takes place in an alternate, early 20th century England, with a vast counterpart of Hadrian's Wall separating the country from the Old Kingdom, in which magic (called Charter magic) is a reality and the dead tend not to stay dead.  Sabriel's father, a necromancer who banishes the dead, disappears and calls to her for help.  Armed with his enchanted sword and seven bells, which have power over the dead, Sabriel enters the Old Kingdom and confronts a powerful, growing evil.<br />** Good, descriptive writing, featuring several wonderful similes and metaphors.<br />** A true teen novel, with direct (if more or less irrelevant) references to drinking and sexuality.<br />The Not-so Good<br />** Flat characterization, including a semi-passive protagonist: Sabriel has no truly defining character traits.  For the most part, she is simply cool and competent, except when the action requires her to get worked up.  She makes few true choices; answering a father's call for help is hardly a choice, and once in the Old Kingdom, she more or less bounces from point A to B to C.<br />** Confusion as to key fantasy elements: the double-edge of the creative setting.  Nix leaves the exact nature of Charter magic for the reader to puzzle out, and the background of the (again, two-dimensional) villain is hastily glossed over.<br />** Reliance on coincidence: at two major points, in the middle and climax, the plot turns on sheer happenstance, forcing the reader to frown and mutter \\"Huh?\\"<br />** Lack of resolution: several minor plot threads seem unresolved after the abrupt ending.  As good as the majority of the novel was, I felt as if someone came and yanked away my four-course supper during the third course.  Perhaps this was done to set up the next book (Lirael) in the trilogy, but perhaps I won't be reading that one.<br />Despite these flaws, I do recommend Sabriel for teens and adults who enjoy fantasy fiction.  The combination and contrast of the Old Kingdom (and the realm of the Dead) and the early twentieth century military outpost that guards the wall is a true addition to the genre, and the necromancer's bells are a fine grace note.

The plot is straightforward: Artemis, a 12-year-old genius and the son of the missing overlord of a criminal dynasty, concocts a scheme to acquire the little golden book of fairy lore and, using its secrets, hold a fairy hostage for an enormous ransom.  The only thing is, Colfer's fairies aren't delicate little Tinkerbell-types; rather, they boast an elite \\"LEP-Recon\\" unit of laser-toting, time-stopping commandos.  Can Artemis and his highly trained bodyguard Butler hold off their assault/rescue attempt and claim a fortune in fairy gold?<br />Colfer's yarn moves quickly and cleverly reimagines the 'little people' for the 21st century.  It also has more than its share of humor, especially when Mulch Diggums the dwarf is involved.  (Colfer provides a new spin on a dwarf's ability to tunnel through the earth.  A two-word hint: pants flap.)  However, while Artemis is often a fascinating character, he's seldom a likable one, given his less than noble motives.  Also, while the lengthy descriptions of the fairy underworld and their technology are \\"neat\\" at first, they become a bit tedious after a while--as does the hardboiled, militaristic dialogue of the LEP-Recon unit (which contains some very mild profanity).<br />In the end, while it has more than its share of machinery and magic, Artemis Fowl falls short on the scales of morality (nothing more than a few references to environmental pollution) and memorableness.  As strongly as the author ties it to the early 21st century and fails to ground it with universal lessons, it's likely that this particular book will one day become obsolete (when our technology does).  I recommend it as a fun summer read from the library (with parental guidance), but build a personal collection with The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, and The Prydain Chronicles (among others) before ordering this one.

What I mean by that is this: in terms of actual plot development, very little happens here.  Each paperback in this trilogy is about 400 pages long (1200 total), so this could easily have been a 2-book saga with little to no impact on its quality.<br />As for the story itself ...  There are some books you can read when you're tired, some you can't, and some that just make you tired.  At its best, this book falls into the first category; at its worst, in the third.  The writing is clear but rough and unremarkable (much more telling than showing, especially where character emotions are concerned, not one clever simile or metaphor), while the plot is uneven and filled with numerous, extended chase and fight sequences that create a sense of deja vu.  (Other reviews here describe the plot, so I won't, except to express complete disappointment with the climax, in which the hero saves the day not through his own talents but through, not just one, but two instances of deus ex machina.)  Two sub-plot threads are interspersed with the main one; however, the female protagonists in those receive so little stage-time that one can only hope their actions will actually mean something later in the trilogy.<br />The book's one strength is its ability to keep you wanting to know what happens next, which is certainly a literary virtue.  However, few to none of the other ones (style, plausibility, insight, etc.) are present here.  I strongly recommend _A Game of Thrones_ by George Martin or _The Briar King_ by Greg Keyes instead of this (though this one does contain a lesser degree of sexual content, if not violence, than those very fine tales).  That said, if you're looking for a fantasy book to distract yourself during a long plane ride, this one would probably work.  2-1/2 disappointed stars.	2004-02-27

At times brilliant (especially in the descriptions of the seasonal festivities), often captivating and humorous, often sluggish and overly subtle, ultimately unfulfilling, it's a book I recommend borrowing from the library before buying.  Not everyone will enjoy such decadence.<br /><br />Speaking of decadence, the tale takes place in Renaissance-era Albion, the England of another world.  Queen Gloriana presides, with the assistance of her counselors, over an empire of remarkable peace and prosperity: a romantic Golden Age in stark contrast to the cynical, iron rule of her father.  All is not well, however, for the queen cannot--despite a veritable circus-stable of lovers male, female, both and other--achieve sexual fulfillment.  (Whereas our own Queen Elizabeth was the 'virgin queen', in name at least, Gloriana proves quite the opposite.)<br /><br />This \\"Queen's Trouble\\", as it's known, correlates to the delicate balance through which peace and prosperity are preserved.  And when one of her counselors makes a personal and political error of judgment, events are set in motion which threaten to topple it all; for the 'underworld' of the past, both figuratively and literally (in the form of the endless, forgotten rooms and passages beneath and within the palace and those who prowl them) begins to rise up and ensnare the present.<br /><br />Within these mazes of intrigue (and shaping them) is an astonishing array of characters: nobles, ambassadors, spies, magicians, servants, poets and so on.  However, one of the book's main weaknesses is that, with so many characters and the story's constantly shifting viewpoint, it's difficult to understand or empathize with any of them.  Then again, many of them are so perverse or amoral that you don't even want to try.  (E.g., one of the main characters murders at least two relative innocents to further his or her plans; and 'kinky' sexual activity in Albion is, so to speak, rampant.)<br /><br />In the end, the means by which the Queen's Trouble is solved was somewhat vague, disturbing and, ironically, unsatisfying.  If I did understand it all correctly, though, it was also disappointing and, IMHO, had nothing of the ring of truth about it.  Although _Gloriana_ has a World Fantasy Award in its crown, I'm sorry to report that, twenty-five years later at least, the queen has no clothes.  Come one, come all to the spectacle (if what's been said above intrigues you), but don't come with your (ahem) hopes too high.<br /><br />2-1/2 stars.

A corporation discovers a stunning new technology, a group of characters gets trapped in the universe opened by technology (where they are both strangers and prey), and adventure ensues as they try to escape.  For those who enjoy this sort of thing (high on tension, pace and detail--in this case more historical than scientific--and low on characterization and 'literary'/remarkable prose), this is one to enjoy.  For others, it's a library loan at best.<br />In a nutshell, the story concerns three graduate students who have been assisting their professor and mentor with an excavation in France.  The group comes to believe that, somehow, the corporation has more information about the dig site than they do.  The professor returns to the U.S. to meet with the Machiavellian CEO, and the students don't hear from him again ... until they uncover a 600-year-old parchment with the words &quot;HELP ME.&quot;  The pace then kicks into overdrive as the students learn their mentor has been transported into 14th century France and that they must travel back to rescue him.  How many of them will return home, if any?  Keep turning pages to find out.<br />Some criticisms now, and spoilers:<br />* The overall premise is horribly flawed.  It's explained that the technology is not really time travel at all, but transportation into another of endless, alternate universes (since quantum theory posits a 'multiverse').  Fine, but if the professor is sent into the past of _another_ universe, then how can his handwritten message reach the students in _this_ one?  (And the whole application of the technology, it's explained, is to enable an 'authentic' recreation of the past; but how can it be 'authentic' if its the past of another world?)<br />* There is far too much action once the students arrive in the alternate past.  As soon as they arrive, they're attacked ... apparently so that they can be separated and problems can develop.  Then it's like all the author's research about jousting, swordplay, siege, etc. (which does look very thorough) had to be crammed into their 37-hour stay.  (They can only stay 37 hours; the chapter-headings are in countdown format.)  For example, it seems that the female student, an architecture specialist, has to be chased into ceilings and rooftops so that the author and she can demonstrate their knowledge of medieval roof construction.  (Again, this assumes the roofs of this alternate world were identical to our own.)<br />* The takedown of the 'heartless CEO' is simply over the top and cruel.  Instead of calling the cops or having the board vote him out, the 'good' executive transports him back to a village decimated by the Black Plague--in essence, murders him.  I think we're supposed to feel a sense of poetic justice.  Unfortunately, my sense was more of disgust.<br />If you're a fan of Crichton or time travel books, you'll probably enjoy this one and can knock it out in a weekend or long plane ride.  If not, you may want to see if the upcoming movie draws good reviews and go with that instead (or not), as the novel, with its pace and constant action, looks like it's always been a screenplay waiting to happen.

When I was in fifth grade, I thought this was the funniest and most entertaining book in the world.  Twenty years later, despite high school, college and law school, my opinion of it is just as high.  This is a wild, wacky, cult-classic that kids, young adults and even parents can read, enjoy and re-read over and over.<br />The sequel to _The Snarkout Boys & the Avocado of Death_, the book features the return of snarkers Walter, Winston and Rat, as well as Uncle Flipping; Osgood Sigerson and Dr. Sacker; the Mighty Gorilla; and that rascally Napoleon of Crime, Wallace Nussbaum.  Just as the young snarkers discover the Dharma Buns Coffee House and a rising Transylvanian poet, the city of Baconburg begins to be terrorized nightly by something dark and fast and ... furry?  A werewolf?!  Quick, grab your stuffed Indian fruit bat and defend yourself!<br />Just as in _Avocado_, Pinkwater writes simply and clearly, deftly weaving the different plot-threads into a (literally) blazing finale.  Quite simply, this is a great, often gut-busting, blissfully zany ride.  (I only wish he'd write another one!)  I ordered a copy off the internet, read it twice, and am donating it to my local library so that kids can enjoy it just as much as I did, back 'in the day'.  Praise St. Barbara of Blint, five burning stars!	2003-11-24
US	50839381	R2DYXRCJLU6HC1	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	3	84	111	N	N	Neither a curse nor a blessing	I read The Curse of Chalion because I was looking for a stand-alone fantasy novel (I'm hesitant to commit to a series after the Wheel of Time debacle), because I hadn't read any of this award-winning author's work, and because of the many glowing reviews here.  It's obvious many people have loved this book.  I had more mixed feelings about it, but I'll try to give my reasons why honestly.  I simply hope that being honest instead of glowing doesn't draw unhelpful marks.<br />Unlike several other non-glowing reviewers, my criticism doesn't come from the author's 'dabbling' outside of the sci-fi genre in which she's established and honored.  Readers (and publishers) do authors a great disservice if, and when, we pigeonhole them in that way.  My criticism focuses on the more practical areas of the story and writing themselves.<br />The most significant flaw is, in many scenes, the writing is overdone or too descriptive and thus slows the pace considerably or else simply proves distracting.  (It reads like a final draft, instead of a professionally edited manuscript.)  For example, here's an exchange between a man and woman who have become attracted to each other, though an obstacle remains between them.  She asks:<br />\\"Do you think I lack courage?\\"<br />\\"Never that,\\" he breathed.<br />She addressed her feet in a growl.  \\"I'd storm heaven for you, if I knew where it was.\\"<br />So I respectfully disagree with the back cover blurb that this is \\"writing as good as it gets.\\"  It's competent and in some places clever, but hardly Pulitzer-caliber.  Overall, I felt the book could have been edited down to three-fourths of its length and been not just as good, but better.  It does accelerate nicely to an ending that ties up all the loose ends (but uses a pretty amazing/eye-rolling coincidence to make the ending possible).  Also, the main character's self-effacing nature--his great competence in seeing everything except how wonderful people think he is--does become tiresome after a while.  And other than him, the characterization is unremarkable.<br />On world-building, the theological system created here is impressive, as is its integration into a well-done calendar, court fashions and funeral rites.  There are five gods in Chalion: the Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, and Bastard.  Each has his or her own colors and devotees, and while it's a well-developed pantheon, it raises a strange question: where did the Bastard come from, if not the Father and Mother?  Also on world-building, the lack of a map greatly inhibited some of the scenes in which the characters discuss plans for traveling or military action.<br />At the core of this book, there's a good story to be found, but you have to be patient, especially through the slow middle chapters.  I'd recommend it as either a used paperback purchase or a library loan for fans of medieval court intrigue or this particular author.  Three neither-regretful-nor-glowing stars for a novel that's hardly a curse, but not quite a blessing either.while.

On a whim, some twenty years later and with a law degree to my name, I tracked down a copy at the public library and ... wow!  I enjoyed it every bit as much.  Daniel Pinkwater deserves major kudos for such a book--someone buy that man a Napoleon or twelve.<br />The fast-paced story is told from the viewpoint of Walter Galt.  Walter is a teenager on the verge of dying from boredom at Ghengis Khan High School, until he meets Winston Bongo, another suffering student and the self-proclaimed inventor of 'snarking out'.  The boys' late-night snarkouts eventually bring them into contact with a smorgasbord of oddball characters (such as Ms. Bentley Saunders Harrison Matthews, aka Rat) and places, from Blueberry Park to Lower North Aufzoo Street to Beanbender's Beer Garden and beyond.  Ultimately, with the help of the world's greatest living detective, Walter, Winston and Rat must locate the world's largest avocado and save the world (or at least the nations' realtors)--but watch out for stuffed Indian fruit bats!<br />Pinkwater is a true original and writes this surreal, comic yarn simply, cleanly, and hilariously.  Highly recommended for kids, parents, avocado lovers ... and even lawyers who used to be kids.  Five stars!	2003-11-10

Reading it, in fact, is more like reading a short story or, more precisely, a tragic play.  (Note how Steinbeck begins almost every chapter with a description of the place in which the chapter's events unfold, almost like stage directions.)  Steinbeck's creation of the man-child Lennie Small, his description and development of the dream shared by Lennie and his guardian-friend George Milton, and the foreshadowed, heart-wrenching conclusion are all sublime.<br />A must-read and must-own.

Loosely based on Louisiana boss Huey Long, Stark is an ultra-charismatic, larger-than-life, Clinton-esque, Southern governor looking to reach the U.S. Senate.  In truth, though, the political story ultimately yields to the personal story of Jack Burden, a reporter turned right-hand man to Stark and the first-person narrator of the book.<br />Burden's vibrantly crackling, descriptive, often lyrical narrative drives the story throughout, frequently delving into the past--his own and others'--to comment upon the present and, just as frequently, infusing descriptions of events with cutting questions of philosophy and observations of human nature.  Burden's chronicles introduce a variety of utterly realistic and memorable minor characters--his ex-wife; his mother; Stark's chauffeur; a judge; the girlfriend of his youth and her brother, just to name a few--and seldom wane in intensity.<br />The one weakness I noticed was that much of the language and dialogue relies on Depression Era slang that can prove distracting and require a bit of thought to figure out.  This proved especially true in the beginning of the novel, the pacing of which is by no means fast; however, once the story got going, I noticed it less and less.  And the last chapter, as Jack struggles with the meaning of all that has happened--struggles to understand if there even is any meaning--is simply sublime.<br />A highly recommended tour de force and great American novel--not so much for its insight into politics, but for its insight into human nature in the whirlwind of history and politics.  A book worth owning and re-reading.  A masterpiece.	2003-09-04

It is, in a word, a keeper.<br />TBK opens with one of (if not the) best preludes in fantasy, which raises the overshadowing concept for the saga: a warrior-queen leads an army of enslaved humans in the storming of their demonic masters' citadel, only to learn that the means of their victory may have set in motion the doom of the world.  In the story itself, set over 2,000 years later, the first signs of this doom begin to appear in the kingdom of Crotheny.  The mythical Briar King, doom's harbinger, is said to be waking from his ancient slumber, even as the wars and intrigues of the human nations carry on, seemingly unaware ...<br />I've been deliberately vague about the actual story and principal characters so as to let the book speak for itself.  I read a good deal of fantasy fiction (and write it as well), and I'm pleased to say that this is one of the best I've read in recent memory.  Keyes writes in clear, often artful prose and has a true gift not only for world-building (and the research that surely underlies it) but also for showing the world and its wonders and horrors vividly without over-description or telling.  (Or at least, when he must tell, he does it in a plausible, often inconspicuous manner.)  The dialogue is crisp and spiced with wit and various languages; the characters are, for the most part, realistic and distinct.  The plot is well-balanced and builds to a page-turning crescendo.  If I have a quibble, it's that not enough of ancient history and mysteries are revealed to make the climax wholly comprehensible.  That is, the hook for the next book is a bit heavily baited, but it's bait that I'll bite on nonetheless.<br />With the medieval/&quot;British&quot; nature of Crotheny and the chapter-by-chapter shifts in character viewpoint, TBK will indeed draw comparisons to A Game of Thrones.  However, they should mainly be favorable comparisons; moreover, TBK develops a different &quot;feel&quot; or texture as it progresses--the lands of Westeros didn't spring to mind as I read on.<br />The bottom line: I read this book free of charge from the public library; I've since ordered it because I'd like a copy for my fantasy shelf and, more importantly, because Keyes deserves our support and encouragement.

It's more of an alternative history than a fantasy--there are no mythical creatures or magic here, although superstitions of both remain.<br />The story falls into two parts. In the first, a stubborn girl seeking vengeance for her murdered family arrives at the mountain home of an exiled hermit who was the greatest warlord in the Empire prior to the death of the old emperor and the takeover by an evil regent. The girl wears him down, and he agrees to teach her swordsmanship and so on, convinced that she will eventually tire and lose hope in her foolish quest. Instead, she perserveres, and he finds himself growing fond of her. Over a two-year span, she becomes a promising pupil; he finds his defenses against the world he left behind crumbling ... and how much he now needs her.<br />In the second part, the two leave the mountain and begin their desperate quest to assassinate the evil regent. It's enough to say that there are no surprises as the tale lumbers towards its anti-climax. In fact, I recommend stopping once they leave the mountain--the development of their bond is the true story here, and frankly, the second part is tedious. Why so?<br />M: Mapping. The political and strategic references that arise in their quest are so convoluted and filled with names and rulers' names that you can't understand what's going on unless you keep flipping back and forth to the map at the front.<br />S: Swordplay. The pair train and train, and the girl learns wonderful fighting patterns and how to make a stronger man's sword slide off her own, and yet, when they finally get into fights, the action is basically described by the swordmaster's count of bodies: \\"one-two, three, four and five.\\" The training scenes are far superior.<br />G: Grammar. Perhaps it was intentionally done to give the story a \\"different\\" (Asian?) feel, but the grammar/style is very unorthodox and often forces the re-reading of passages. Dashes, italics and fragments are everywhere (often thought-fragments), slowing the scan constantly. (I tend to read quickly, but reading this book was often like running through a rice paddy--in ankle weights.)<br />Finally, most of the story is told from the man's viewpoint, and he's simply not likeable. Of course, a character doesn't have to be likeable, but his constant irritability and \\"damn\\" this-es and thats ultimately prove tedious.  (If he is a paladin or samurai, he surely missed his etiquette training.) His repetitive lusting for the girl--though very realistic given the time/place context and often well described--may also seem creepy to some readers. (He's forty; she's sixteen.) His retired warhorse, in fact, is the most pleasant character present--and I can't understand why we're never even given one look at the man through the girl's eyes.<br />The first part of the novel is worth reading, especially if you like realistic characters and Oriental culture.

The seed for the next book (The Devil's Armor) is planted well in the first, and I hope more of the good than the bad from the first book carries over.<br />TEOG consists of three parts. (And before that, a beautiful cover--one of its very best features.) The first is basically a rehashing of Camelot's love triangle. The book does open very well indeed with excellent, fresh introductions of the scholarly King Akeela the Good; his handsome champion, Lukien the Bronze Knight; and his new bride, Cassandra, the beautiful seal on a peace treaty. However, even with the twist of Cassandra's mysterious illness and Lukien's quest to heal her, the first part fails to escape Camelot's shadow--it simply starts too squarely within it.<br />The second part begins sixteen years after the first, depicting how the consequences of the first have transformed Akeela the Good into the drunken, insane Akeela the Ghost. A crippled boy, Gilwyn, born in the first part, takes center stage and finds himself drawn into the tragic current of the past, which is sweeping the kingdom and a peaceful, foreign land into an even more destructive future. This theme continues in the third part, which introduces a hidden sanctuary of \\"Inhumans,\\" persons born or made deformed, and the mysterious woman and spirits who lead and assist them.<br />Marco's main strengths are his no-nonsense writing style and ability to describe large battles. However, these are often hindered, and in places overcome, by some very poor dialogue and questionable plotting. At times, the noble/successful/intelligent characters make utterly capricious decisions that, in retrospect, seem to have been made just so that the plot could follow a fixed outline. (A minor quibble/example: over a period of years, wouldn't even the most inept husband be able to make love in total darkness to his wife? A strange question, I know, but the book's answer--for the plot's sake--is apparently not.)

US	50839381	RB57JWM4SVV4Q	0380791269	858619462	The Gilded Chain:: A Tale of the King's Blades (Tales of the King's Blades Series)	Books	3	14	17	N	N	Musketeers on speed	Fantasy books can be like beverages: you have your exquisitely aged wines (The Lord of the Rings, Mists of Avalon); your rich ports and liquors (the works of Guy Kay and Patricia McKillip); your searingly clear vodka (A Song of Ice and Fire); your boxed wines (The Wheel of Time, The Sword of Truth); and your panoply of Bud, Coors, Schlitz and so on. This novel, the first in Duncan's King's Blades series, is the Jolt Cola of the fantasy canon:  for those who love page-turning, caffeine-burning, sword-and-sorcery sugar, this is one for you.<br />The King's Blades are master swordsmen trained from youth in Ironhall. The senior trainee, when called upon by the king, endures a magical ritual in which a sword is driven through his heart by his ward. If the trainee survives, he becomes a bound blade, a bodyguard with magically enhanced strength, speed and stamina, one of the greatest swordsmen in the land: a musketeer on speed, whose first priority is always his ward's safety.<br />The Gilded Chain chronicles the life of Durendal, perhaps the greatest of all Blades, from his beginning as the Ironhall Brat, through his fabled career as Blade, adventurer, captain of the guard, and so on. Duncan tells the story at breakneck speed with a minimum of commentary or description, spinning off a huge yarn of adventure and intrigue in a land reminiscent of 16-17th century England. (There is the minister of this and that, Parliament, the Exchequer, and so on; and with armor largely obsolete due to new conjurations, rapiers are the weapon of choice.) The overall feel certainly recalls Dumas's musketeers and the episodic French tales of Gargantua and Pantagruel and Candide.<br />This is not to say that the writing itself is especially elegant or refined. Certainly there are better-written works rotting in the slush pile of every publishing house. It doesn't help that the first chapter after the prologue can only be understood hundreds of pages later or that women have almost no presence whatsoever (with the possible exception of Durendal's wife), except when they're mentioned in the running gag about how the Blades' superhuman stamina doesn't require them to sleep at night ...<br />Fun, fast, furious, potentially addictive--The Gilded Chain is best obtained as a library loan. Unless you really love this kind of thing, there's no need to 'jolt' your wallet or reserve a special place in your cellar.e whatsoever (with the possible exception of Durendal's wife), except when they're mentioned in the running gag about how the Blades' superhuman stamina doesn't require them to sleep at night ...<br />Fun, fast, furious, potentially addictive--The Gilded Chain is best obtained as a library loan.

The Innkeeper's Song is a one-volume fantasy for mature readers that is by turns (or even simultaneously) lyrical and maddening.  Lyrical because much of its language is, in contemporary fantasy, on par with only Patricia McKillip and Guy Gavriel Kay.  Maddening because--despite the full-throttle beginning, intricately woven characters and a world made wondrous without a map or long descriptions but simply by names and prosaic brushstrokes--the promise of the beginning and middle absolutely fizzles to a all-but-incomprehensible anti-climax in which none of the characters' skills, virtues or flaws seem to matter.  It's the equivalent of dreaming oneself into a world of rich and dread beauty, flying over that world so freely as to go beyond dreaming entirely ... and then being slapped awake to find oneself flailing at the air and wondering, \\"What might have been ...\\"<br />Sigh.<br />The tale concerns three women who arrive at an inn in the course of their quest to protect their ancient magician-friend from a renegade apprentice so that he might die in peace and not rise as a tormented ghost.  The three are a warrior-nun who has escaped her convent; a legendary thief-sailor-swordsman; and a village girl whom the thief raised from a drowning death with the magician's ring.  Added to these memorable figures are the earnest stable-boy; the gruff innkeeper; the nun's companion (a fox); and the stubborn boy who was betrothed to the village girl and follows her in the hope of reclaiming their lost love.<br />Each chapter proceeds from the first-person viewpoint of a different character (central or not), which works well overall but sometimes proves tiresome, especially when the author chooses (or is forced to) use a minor character as the \\"camera\\" for a particular scene or plot development or when the character's \\"voice\\" is confusing or not quite right.  However, the chapters told by the thief are particularly well done; and she emerges as one of the most admirable, engaging characters in contemporary fantasy.

A race of sorcerors that was once betrayed and conquered but now, as advisors, holds great power in the land. A conspiracy led by a mysterious dream-walker. Assassins, torture, secrets, fortunetelling, ghosts--even wonderful titles for both book and saga. And yet . . . something's missing.<br />It's hard to say exactly what that something is. It's not the author's writing technique, which flows well and, in places, is elegant. Rather, someone once said that reading a good book or a poem in translation is like making love through plate-glass: you can see everything, but it just doesn't feel the same. It's like that here: you can see all of these elements and hear the characters and watch them in life and death situations . . . but you're not really afraid for them because you know they'll be just fine. (Part of this may be the book's general \\"PG-13\\" atmosphere, as compared to the solid \\"R\\" or \\"NC-17\\" of, for example, _A Game of Thrones_. Thus, younger fans or fans of \\"high\\" fantasy may find this book more engaging than their older or \\"lower\\" counterparts.)<br />Not fearing for the character is a minor problem; however, not being able to know them is not. They have faces and a trait or two, but not full-blooded hearts. None has a distinctive way of speaking, and the ones who must be different (such as the alcholic duke whose belief in the hero's guilt cannot be shaken for the plot's sake) are perilously close to caricatures. Character interaction is also weakened by ad nauseum descriptions of small smiles, head nods, and one person saying the other's name to stop him/her just before he/she leaves the room. (And while it would giving away too much to elaborate, one of the two \\"hooks\\" in the final chapter was so cliched that it provoked a spontaneous groan.)<br />If you enjoy a fairly clean, high fantasy tale, you may very well find this to be a 4-5 star book. But if you're looking for a fantasy with true fire and passion, the works of George R.R. Martin, Robin Hobb, and (particularly) Guy Gavriel Kay should prove much more satisfying.

Barnes and his comrades, including the \\"damned good looking\\" Lady Brett Ashley, make their way from Paris to Pamplona and partake of the week-long bullfighting fiesta.  Hemingway reveals his own passion for bullfighting in his smooth description of the matadors' artistry and in the distinguishing of those whose work is mere illusion from those who work with true grace and courage.<br />Throughout the story, moments of violence burst through the affected nonchalance of Jake's circle.  Emotions run high as the men strive for Brett's affections, win them . . . lose them just as quickly.  One of the most enticing anti-heroines in literature, Brett is an alcoholic and (possible) nymphomaniac, as much at the mercy of her whims as those around her.  She is described as \\"Circe\\" because she turns the men around her to pigs; a group of Spanish dancers form a circle around her but prevent her from dancing--she must be still, worshipped as an idol.  She is a remarkable character, adored and yet worthy of our pity: only an impotent man is safe with her; only a healthy man can satisfy her cravings.<br />A fascinating achievement in twentieth century writing, TSAR has aged in places, where much of the characters' slang is unfamiliar.  Nonetheless, it reads quickly and often easily, providing a good introduction to Hemingway's work and a disturbingly vivid picture of the lost generation.	2002-10-20

Their stories begin separately but merge into one, as Ash--inside of whom a massive, frightening power is building--must reach the legendary Cavern, the only place where Ash can discharge the power without breaching the world of the damned. The story thus becomes a race against time and the merciless elements of Jones' northern lands.<br />Jones deserves credit for painting such a _different_ landscape: stark, vivid, and breathtakingly cold. Breath instantly condenses to ice crystals on fur-lined hoods; eyelids freeze shut in the night; and wounds and frostbite . . . it's all very intense, to say the least.  Some may find all of this engaging; others may find it an exercise in shock-value.  Personally, a bit of each appears to be true.<br />Jones writes with a brutal power of description, frequently employing creative and graphic similes which sometimes work and sometimes are just too over the top. The book is _very_ long and could have been shortened without much loss, and some parts are confusing and need a bit more explanation of the history and powers involved. (And some are simply designed to bait hooks for the next volume.) The supporting characters and villagers--they, their names and voices never quite find a comfortable niche, falling somewhere between medieval Scots and American hillbillies. Though often described in detail, the main characters themselves are not especially unique (with the exception of Magdalena Crouch, assassin), yet you find yourself caring for the young heroes, alone in the deadly wilderness on their desperate quest.<br />A solid, graphic, often gripping effort, yet one that demands significant time and attention and seems to require much more reading for an appreciable payoff. Recommended for mature, hard-core fantasy readers.	2002-04-23

The difficulty arises primarily from the same thing that my lukewarm 3-star rating does: the uneven, jam-packed narrative and the periodic confusion that it caused.<br />The narrative is really three-fold: (1) the main story, as seen through the eyes of Livak, a tough, lucky female thief who stumbles into a quest for artifacts that may somehow be linked to a lost race and new kind of magic; (2) near-simultaneous events occuring elsewhere, told from a third-person viewpoint but focusing on an irritating, pompous minor wizard, Casuel; and (3) excerpts from treatises in the fantasy world that are supposed to provide key information to understanding things that will soon happen. The problem, in a nutshell, was that there were just too many things--a pantheon/religious system that is only explained piecemeal; systems of magic explained sometimes in too much or too little detail for comprehension; scenes where you can't tell how many wizards are talking in a room or exactly which villain is which in a combat; etc.<br />To the author's credit, Livak is an engaging protagonist, and her narrative (often filled with clever details of thieving) is usually fun to read. Just when things tend to get moving, though, the next chapter begins with a dense passage from a treatise or, worse, whatever Casuel is doing--and the frustrating thing (having read it through now) is that he really is only a bit player in the story! Why so much of the story focuses on him (an unlikable character) is a mystery to me, as is using &quot;stuff the chicken&quot; repeatedly as a synonym for sex and having the wizard Livak accompanies declare his homosexuality (apparently for no other reason than to make it a &quot;modern&quot; fantasy) when to keep him straight might have actually done more for inter-character tensions and connections.  (And the name for the main villain is &quot;The Iceman&quot; . . .)<br />One bright note is that the author's writing does seem to improve in both substance and style as the book progresses (although the final battle scene is still a mess). I don't know whether the next books in the series benefit from tighter, cleaner plotting and description, but on the strength of this one, I'd recommend Robin Hobb's _Liveship Traders_ series if you're looking for a strong, vibrant female protagonist (and fascinating story).

The Mirror of Her Dreams is a low fantasy that chronicles the &quot;translation&quot; of the beautiful but insipid Terisa Morgan into the beseiged realm of Mordant by way of &quot;Imagery,&quot; sorcery that brings things out of mirrors. In this case, a clumsy apprentice, Gerarden, enters a mirror in Mordant in hope of finding the &quot;champion&quot; that the mirror depicts. Instead, he finds himself in Teresa's sterile New York penthouse and, thinking that she may instead be Mordant's savior, persuades her to return with him. A maelstrom of court intrigue arises on Terisa's appearance in Orison, the sprawling castle-capital of Mordant (reminiscent of the castle in Peake's Gormenghast saga); and of course, someone (or multiple someones) desire the newcomer's death. Meanwhile, the elderly king feigns silent senilty (or does he?), armies march, and monsters summoned by Imagery assault the countryside. Can Terisa and Gerarden stay alive and help Mordant do the same?<br />Unfortunately, the first book of the duology suffers from a plodding pace and creates more questions than it answers. The 3-star rating reflects a general admiration for SRD's imagination (as exemplified by the creation of Imagery and its central debate about the independent existence of things shown in mirrors) and his ability to describe people, places and action sequences in fine detail. (The king's daughters and Master Eremis are particularly well depicted, as is Terisa's eerie attraction to the latter. The opening description of her dream of riders in the snow is also wonderful.)<br />However, the rating also reflects the uneven depth of characterization and the general sense of frustration created by (to name a few things), Terisa's persistent doubts about her own existence; King Joyce's inactivity; the castellan's Gestapo-like interviews; the inability of the greatest swordsman/assassin in an adjacent kingdom to kill Terisa in multiple attempts; and Gerarden's clumsiness (which eventually becomes a weak plot device).<br />Uncertainty and frustration indeed seem to be the major themes of the novel; and as themes, they sometimes turn pages as the intrigue thickens, but they also make it difficult to actually like or identify with many characters, the bland Terisa in particular. (In fact, the only readily likeable character in the entire novel is Gerarden's heroic brother Artagel, strictly a supporting role.)<br />In sum, TMOHD exemplifies both the strengths and weakness of low fantasy. The realism created by the use of imperfect characters and complex, ambiguous situations can be engaging. However, too much imperfection and groping in the dark can result in the &quot;translation&quot; of the reader out of a keen and poignant realm of imagination and back into our own problematic world.

In a time when fantasy novels can achieve best-seller status, it both amazes and troubles me that, until last year, I had not heard of GGK's splendid work. But now, fortunately, I have heard and read _The Fionavar Tapestry_ and _A Song for Arbonne_ and most recently this . . . masterpiece.<br />It is difficult to summarize the plot, for so much of the story unfolds organically--indeed, as a near-perfect tainflower--that one fears to spoil the pleasure of becoming swept up in the narrative. That said, the tale concerns the Palm, a mythic penninsula reminiscent of Italy, a land divided between two wizard-conquerors. One conqueror has utterly blighted the province of Lower Corte with an undreamt-of dark magic. (Take a fresh look at the map of the Palm mid-way through, and you will grasp the immensity of the spell!) A handful of refugees must undo the spell . . . yet if the one wizard falls, the other will irrevocably gain control of the Palm, leaving the deadly choice: the breaking of the spell, interminable conquest . . . or, perhaps, perhaps, the smallest gleam of freedom.<br />GGK's writing flows well, as always, fresh and lyrical and soaked with human understanding. The first chapter is a work of genius for its perspective on the heroes' way of building toward their goal, as is the surprising revelation in the climax, and--perhaps most of all--the heart-tingling last paragraph. (Wait!) The only flaw is Baerd's strange, protracted battle with the Night-walkers (a touch cliched), and (just perhaps) a touch of gratuitous eroticism in Castle Borso. Even so, these flaws are minor and only faintly detract from the beauty of the whole, which merits a solid 4-1/2 stars.<br />\\"Tigana, may the memory of you be like a blade in my soul!\\" (And may GGK's work receive its just recognition)	2001-07-23

This is a work of both high and low fantasy, marking the beginning of a remarkable 6-book tale (the Chronicles Trilogy, followed by the even more magnificent Legends Trilogy), which greatly increased the interest in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game throughout the 1980's. (And here in 2001, it's still being read . . .) It certainly does contain more than a few stock fantasy elements (e.g. dragons, elves, dwarves, an unlikely group of friends somehow being chosen to stop the conquest of Evil . . .). However, the straightforward, simple way in which the tale is told and (even more so) the distinct, &quot;real&quot; nature of (most of) its characters set it apart from the paperback fantasy pack.<br />(Another wonderful aspect of the trilogy is the title sequence: autumn twilight, winter night, spring dawning. Why? Because this is the timeless pattern of fantasy tales: the strengthening of Evil compels weakened and bickering good forces to unite and strengthen, to become Good so that the glory of life may continue--weakness to death to resurrection, as with each turning year, as with us . . .)<br />Who can forget the irrepresible Tasslehoff, the conflicted Tanis Half-Elven, or the cynical, amibitious Raistlin as they strive to carry word of the ancient, true gods to a war-torn land? Some of the other companions (particularly Sturm and Riverwind) are a little bland in comparison, and the comic relief with the gully dwarves and the magician Fizban is sometimes too modern-feeling and cute (like the ewoks in Return of the Jedi).<br />Nonetheless, this series is worthwhile reading for the fantasy fan, often resounding with the true voice of a legend (greatly assisted by splendid songs and poetry throughout), leading onward into the heart of story (as one of the poems proclaims).	2001-05-10

Be warned, though, REH's writing can be quite different from that of modern writers: sometimes brooding, sometimes utterly pulp-ish in its almost garish vividness.  Nonetheless, it's that very quality that makes it so fascinating and, at times, as strong and elegant as the axe of the protagonist.<br />Speaking of whom, he is like Rodin's &quot;Thinker&quot; with larger muscles and longer hair.  An Atlantian usurper of the throne of Valusia, he finds himself perpetually assailed by conspirators (whether domestic, foreign or, for something completely different, possessed of human bodies and serpent heads).  One could thus group the stories here into a couple of categories: (1) The Conspiracies (The Shadow Kingdom, By This Axe I Rule, and Swords of the Purple Kingdom--the latter two being quite similar); (2) The Oddities (e.g. Delcardes' Cat, The Striking of the Gong and The Skull of Silence); and (3) The Unfinished (which are obvious).  (So yes, be forewarned, especially if you need closure in your tales.)<br />REH's genius shows through most clearly in the Conspiracies, where one marvels at the power of his imagination--he seems to have created this pre-Flood world out of whole cloth!  As noted, the writing is often fine, and from the viewpoint of the fantasy fan, this is foundational reading.  From here, it's logical to read _The Hour of the Dragon_, REH's only novel and a tale of that legendary king who evolves from Kull of Atlantis: Conan of Cimmeria.	2001-04-02

KB also has a nice eye for imagery, the most powerful being the gray-clad rider and his sinister pairs of black arrows. And she, on the whole, creates a clean, refreshing fantasy setting. These traits will serve her well if and when she publishes again . . .<br />And now the bad: As can be forgiven in a first novel, the plot often becomes a mess, either bogging down or running haywire. The former occurs near the beginning with the whole, weird episode with Miss Bayberry and Miss Bunchberry, whose presence simply throws the otherwise late-medieval setting entirely out of alignment by stuffing it with things Victorian. The latter occurs, as might be expected, at the climax, where KB conducts something of a gambit with a super-magical chess game, the foundation for which is not entirely laid. A strong sense of resolution is also lacking.<br />That said, the book is readable and does draw you in nicely at times. While KB's work by no means approaches that of, e.g., Robin Hobb's, it has potential. Writing is a long ride, as KB (referring to herself as a &quot;Green Writer&quot;) might realize.

(GGK does allude to Fionavar quite nicely, however, in a brief lullaby.)<br />While the plot is perhaps too complex for adequate summarization here, it's certainly not too complex for your reading pleasure.  At the heart of this tale of an alternate medieval reality is Blaise of Gorhaut (Germany), a knight who has traveled to &quot;sun-blessed&quot; Arbonne (France) for the primary purpose of leaving his past behind.  As events unfold, however, Blaise is carried higher and higher into the ranks of Arbonne's ruling class, and soon he must confront the daunting destiny that his past has placed before him . . .<br />GGK writes well, as always, and like a good troubadour, he pays tribute to the fantasy genre while ensuring that the reader/listener is surprised and touched by his work.  Perhaps most importantly, GGK believes in the beauty of Art and power of Art's beauty to make more beautiful the things which it depicts, in this case Mankind, Men and Women striving to preserve what is good and noble--that is, to ensure that life's music does not become harsh noise, but remains forever a soft, bright song . . .  (Thus savor the book's lyric harmonies.)<br />Note:  If you enjoy GGK's work, you may wish to see an excellent fan website, brightweavings.com.	2001-02-19

If there were justice in the literary world, you'd think he'd have received more acclaim and notice than a certain Mr. J-----, also a TOR author, as Brust's writing is crisp and lively, his pacing excellent.<br />As explained in an &quot;interview&quot; with the book's pompous narrator, Brust writes for those who love to read, i.e. those who enjoy a good vocabulary, good grammar, good phrasing, and (indeed) a good story.  This is not some &quot;page-turner&quot; to be engulfed at one-sitting; if you did that with a box of Godiva chocolates, you'd become ill and lose the appreciation for each one.  Just so with each of the book's chapters.  The plot does slow a little too much in places--often due the musings of the intruding, over-erudite narrator--but there are worthy adages, tales and metaphors therein; don't miss them.<br />This is a fine, fine work.  The swashbuckling spirit of _The Phoenix Guards_ remains intact, but partially cloaked by ominous portents.  Do not miss these two books if you enjoy a good tale (fantasy or otherwise).  I'll eagerly await the third.<br />(Postscript: Perhaps best of all, the story ends! Take note, Messrs. J----- and G-------.)	2000-11-29
US	50839381	R1AFYBH6VUX73H	0812506898	61718670	The Phoenix Guards	Books	4	18	18	N	N	Very nice change of pace	The brief review:  I had a slight smile on my face the entire time I read this book.  It is, as a reviewer of the Three Muskateers might have once said, &quot;charming.&quot;<br />To elaborate:  Brust is very well (some might say &quot;over&quot;) educated and knows how to turn a phrase.  The plot moves along briskly; the characters, while not fleshed out too thoroughly, do have distinct and effective personalities.  I was, at first, a bit lost about the world's/realm's infrastructure of Houses and about the characteristics of each (and what animals the fantasy names correlate to).  However, I've not read the Vlad Taltos series, which apparently sheds some light on those matters.<br />This is not a book to be read at breakneck speed, as the dialogue must be savored and as there are plot details that could otherwise be missed.  That said, even if one does commit to reading each excruciatingly polite phrase that the characters utter, there are still times when one wants to throttle them for not getting to the point.  Brust plays this game nicely, but he perhaps goes to the well one too many times.  Nevertheless, in two words, as the wonderfully pompous narrator might say, this is an amiable sabre-and-sorcery frolick, and I plan to check out Five Hundred Years After, the next book, very soon.  (Closer to 3-1/2 or 3-3/4 stars, but 4 is certainly not a stretch.)	2000-11-20
US	50839381	R1VLOCMEJ8IV3S	1568650094	386081136	The Complete Book of Swords (Omnibus, Volumes 1, 2, 3)	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Nothing special	I'd really give this 2-1/2 stars, mostly because of the very good premise with the Swords and the setup in the first few chapters of Book One (in which the writing is markedly better than in later chapters--deadline rush?). In essence, the god Vulcan forges 12 magical swords, each with distinctive powers, and lets them loose in the world, in the hands of mortals.  From then on, though, the story's a rapid, sometimes confusing yarn where things just don't seem to add up. And, perhaps most glaringly in the light of modern fantasy standards, there is _no_ distinctive characterization. The characters are just shells who ride the whirlwind of the narrative: Mark is a bland hero with a mysterious father; Ben is big and strong and not as dumb as he looks; Barbara is a woman who can use a sling; Baron Doon has a Machiavellian, treasure-hunting streak. That's about it. (I think Nestor simply disappears after Book One. What the heck happened?)<br />In sum, it's fun to watch the introduction of each Sword, its power and weakness, but the Swords are much more interesting than the characters. If you're in the mood for fantasical adventure, read something by Fritz Leiber or Robin Hobb instead (or, for a true change, Guy Gavriel Kay).	2000-11-14
US	50839381	R2DFVJNJG8J79M	031293243X	143014365	The First Book of Lost Swords: Woundhealer's Story	Books	2	3	7	N	N	Innocuous fluff	I read the Complete Book of Swords just to introduce myself to an older fantasy writer whom I hadn't read before, and I read this one just as a follow-up, perhaps hoping the tale would get better.  It didn't.  The story is simplistic, with an absolute minimum of characterization.  There are a couple of clever moments (e.g. Amintor's desperate gamble while holding Woundhealer), but overall, there's just not much good fantasy &quot;meat&quot; here.  I might recommend this at a 8th-9th grade reading level, i.e. if someone that age really needed to read a fantasy book.  But even then, Alexander's Prydain Chronicles are far superior.	2000-11-14

It departs from the genre in that its characters are not exceptionally gifted or powerful adventurers or warriors.  Instead, they're traders and sailors and matriarchs in more of a sixteenth to seventeenth century atmosphere.  The discussions amongst the Vestrit women in Bingtown and the political machinations do tend to drag in places, and some of the plot lines are tied either too neatly or too loosely at the end. (Who/what is Amber?  Did I miss a revelation?)  Nevertheless, as with the Farseer Trilogy, this trilogy is a breath of fresh air--with some fine writing, too.<br />I would now like to criticize and rebut the extreme and unjust comments in the 10/28/00 review by Survivor 33, who stated that Ms. Hobb believes it is acceptable to rape characters.  This is simply wrong.  Yes, there are rapes in the trilogy; and yes, one's heart can go out to those who have themselves been scarred by the evil of others in real life.  However, shall authors then refrain from holding a mirror up to such evil, where it can be seen and considered and condemned?  The following quote from p. 437 of the hardcover edition should sufficiently rebut Survivor 33's insulting claim:  &quot;'It is the greatest wrong that can be done to a female, human or dragon.  It affronts and disgusts me on all levels.  If you have done this . . . it is irreparable.  Not even your death could atone for it.'&quot;  Enough said.<br />In sum, this book and trilogy are imperfect, but they are engaging.  The first, Ship of Magic, is particularly strong.	2000-11-07

I tend to avoid hack-and-slash paperback candies, as well as the ridiculously endless doorstops (Has the Wheel turned yet? What a pity . . .). This book is neither. Ms. Hobb (a pen name, and that was one mildly irritating thing, as she published other works in the '80's and so is not a new author as the book jacket suggests) is a wonderful word-smith and storyteller. Her first-person narrative is effective and engaging, although the introductory set-up of the events as a flashback/memoir somewhat undercuts the later dramatic tension. I.e., the teller obviously lived through all the related events.<br />This is a coming-of-age novel about a castle bastard's growth into a young assassin.  Beyond that, though, there are wonderful details of medieval life, of a medieval town, and of more intimate things--of dogs and the maturing of boys and girls. The build-up to the climax was a little prolonged and at times confusing, and the climax itself was somewhat predictable; nevertheless, one of the last paragraphs is nothing less than sublime. (Of course, it involves a dog.)<br />Questions do linger, e.g. what is the process of Forging exactly? Thus, the stage is set for the next book. Will I rush out and read it? I don't know, but if I don't, I can still count this as one of the better--and more different--fantasy novels I've encountered. Well done.	2000-10-06

From Juan de las Alas, who defies the Church and gravity, to Pedro and the child Catarina, the characters have depth and personality. In a story that is engrossing and entertaining, the author sheds light not only on a forgotten corner of colonial Latin America but also on the place of women, Indians, and heretics within it.	2000-07-12

As with the Harry Potter books (silly as they may be), we Christians need to use careful, intelligent discernment and not automatically condemn anything with &quot;magic.&quot; After all, what then do we say of C.S. Lewis' _Chronicles of Narnia_ or _The Lord of the Rings_, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, a Catholic?  (And yes, Catholics are Christians, contrary to some misinformed opinions.)<br />As occasional entertainment, where the players play good characters, D&amp;D has its merits. Playing in that way is not inconsistent with devotion to Jesus Christ; the greatest danger is that, in playing it, you not be spending your time in a way that best advances God's kingdom. Thus the need for moderation . . .  I found that my playing of the game aided my vocabulary, imagination, organization, memory and writing skills--and my friends and I had fun and didn't go out drinking, using drugs, or womanizing. In that sense, it was a good thing.	1999-11-19
