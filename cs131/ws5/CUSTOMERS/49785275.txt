He has high standards for women, but not in the usual sense. He won't date a woman who doesn't like Pinot, you could say that he's obsessed with wine.<br /><br />In the midst of waiting to hear about his book getting published or rejected once again, he takes his buddy Jack on a \\"last week as a bachelor\\" road trip to Santa Ynez Valley, \\"the poor mans Napa/Sonoma.\\" Jack looks forward to the trip and sees it as a male bonding experience, but also hopes that he will get lucky one last time, before marrying Babs in a week. He knows nothing about wine and wine tasting, but Miles tries to educate him. Like a good student, Jack answers, \\"I will try to remember that.\\"<br /><br />With Jack's fiance waiting for him at home, Jack and Miles tour wineries during the day and scan the local bar scene at night. Miles meets Maya once again, a waitress/goddess in the only restaurant he frequents while traveling there. Jack gets acquainted with Maya's friend Terra and they become a foursome. Miles is getting over his ex-wife who is recently remarried, and Jack starts to wonder if he wants to go down that path, as he becomes more and more infatuated with Terra. They are both living a lie as Terra knows nothing of Jack's upcoming nuptials and Maya isn't aware that Miles's novel is not even close to becoming published. Miles is the voice of reason, but will Jack listen? What will happen if/when their new friends find out the truth?<br /><br />I found that the book was very similar to the movie with a few slight alterations and character descriptions. I liked that the ending was different, but I probably would have enjoyed the book more if I hadn't watched the movie first. It was interesting to see the differences between Miles and Jack, like an angel and a devil. Miles is cynical but honest, and feels guilty about everything. Jack floats through life and has the drive of a 15 year old boy. It's about friendship and how they change when someone gets married, getting over lost loves and finding new ones, and (of course) about wine.when someone gets married, getting over lost loves and finding new ones, and (of course) about wine.	2005-08-13

The first time I had heard of Munchausen by Proxy was in my Abnormal Psychology class. I couldn't believe that something like this actually existed. How could someone do this to their child? It is when a caretaker (often a mother) will keep his/her child sick or try to prove to others that the child is sick to gain attention for themselves. Unfortunately many cases go unnoticed because of how easy it is to hide. \\"A recent study indicates that when a case of MBP is finally recognized, up to 25% of the sickened child's siblings have already died---most likely earlier victims of the perpetrator.\\"<br /><br />Julie has always been a sickly child, for as long as she could remember. Her mother and grandmother often ran her to the hospital for food poisoning. There were very strange things that would go on in her family. Her grandmother would take her on fishing trips at the age of 3 or 4. She would tell her to hold on to something in the car, and get in a minor car accident. She would do this often, and it would always end the same. The grandmother would \\"disappear\\" and Julie would wander off, while crowds gathered, and someone would take her home to her mother. Her grandmother would come back, looking around for her lost granddaughter.<br /><br />Her father had strange habits as well. He was a war veteran, who would spend days in front of the television, watching endless hours of M.A.S.H., and would yell at anyone who walked in front of the TV. He would only talk to you during commercials.<br /><br />Her mother took her to endless doctors, only rushing her away to another one when they couldn't find anything wrong with her. When that didn't work, she kept her from eating and didn't give her lunch money. Julie was weak and malnourished. She got migraines quite often. When she did, Sandy (her mother) gave her a white pill to put under her tongue. Somehow, the migraines only got worse. When Julie stayed in the hospital so the doctors could take a closer look at what was happening with her heart, the sickness disappeared like magic. Doctors were baffled and her mother surprisingly wasn't happy about the good news.<br /><br />I felt tremendous sympathy and compassion for this little girl and wondered why she didn't leave earlier. When she finally did leave (they weren't keeping her under lock and key) it surprised me that she came back. She had been humiliated, put down, beaten, forced to eat tissue, and many other things. I have never been the victim of abuse, so I don't know the feelings  of attachment and dependence that she connected to her abusers. There were times that I almost put the book down because I had a hard time digesting the fact that this actually happens to children.<br /><br />It was difficult to read, especially at the parts where no one believed Julie, and some people turned against her because they thought that she was telling lies about her mother. Sandy was an exquisite actress. She played the role of the perfect mother to a tee, horrified that something could happen to her baby, and that maybe Julie only had a little while to live. The fact that she got out without getting killed was astonishing.<br /><br />I would have liked to see an epilogue, and whether or not she confronted her mother. I would also like to know her mothers thoughts and the allegations against her. I would also like to know the details of such things like the \\"white pills\\" that were used to take away her migraines and what her mother was doing to her to make her sick.<br /><br />This should be recommended reading so people will be aware of this not commonly known, life-threatening illness.was happening with her heart, the sickness disappeared like magic.

I loved Whitney Gaskell's last book, Pushing 30, so I was very excited to read this one. It takes place in New York and (one of my favorites) London.<br /><br />Claire meets Jack on the flight to London because she is doing a piece for her travel writing, not so hip magazine, Sassy Seniors. Jack seems to have no flaws, and very interested in her, but there's a catch: He already has a girlfriend. Good news! He's going to break up with her as soon as he lands. When their witty, friendly banter turns into flirting, she wonders if he is lying, that he really wants to get her into bed. But truth be told, he genuinely likes her and spends a couple days with her in London.<br /><br />When she finds out who he has broken up with, she has a moral dilemma to deal with. Will she leave a relationship with a man she actually feels could go somewhere just to save this person's heart from breaking more or tell this person that she wants to be with Jack, and nothing will stop her?<br /><br />There are slight twists and turns throughout the novel, especially toward the end and I was hoping it would stop there. But, unfortunately, it had to keep going and what follows is a truly predictable ending. I don't have a problem with light, beach reads, (chick lit is obviously a favorite of mine) but I'm usually the last one to know when it comes to secrets. Not in this novel. Either the main character is not very intelligent, or too jaded to analyze things, but I felt my eyes start to roll and knew what was going to happen before it did.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the humor kept it afloat, though sometimes the dialouge was too flawless to be real. It read quickly and kept me interested, though I was hoping for a different ending. I didn't give it more stars because, like the dialouge, the character of Jack was also perfect. Claire's friendship with Maddy, Max, and all of those around her had problems that were solved with a neat little bow, and maybe I'm the one too jaded for that.<br /><br />Read if you would like a fun, though foreseeable book. Especially if you are an armchair traveler who loves London, as I do.jaded for that.  <br /> <br />Read if you would like a fun, though foreseeable book.

She tells a story like no other author I have read. The simplest description is beautifully woven. The writing was still beautiful and it kept me interested, until all sorts of improbable scenarios kept popping up.<br /><br />Betta recently lost her husband to cancer. She decides to leave their home in Boston, which has been recently sold, and move to a small town in the midwest. She has no money worries, since their home has been sold for 1.something million. She decides to take a year and grieve for her beautiful husband.<br /><br />When Betta and John met, they needed no one else. She deserted her friends and spent her life with him. He was the perfect man, and I'm not exaggerating. The descriptions she wrote about him were unbelieveable. I'm sure that there are men out there that write cryptic one or two word messages for their wife after they die, but do they also hide gifts for them all over the house, including a jade necklace? Do they say, \\"Welcome to Tuesday, Betta,\\" everyday with a greeting like that? Do they go to high school productions, and, after seeing that a girl does not receive flowers from her family, run out and buy some for her and say, \\"These are to express my admiration.\\" ??? Maybe I'm just jaded. Or, maybe this was the beginning of the unrealitic events that took place within the book.<br /><br />The ten year old boy comes over and hangs out with her a few times, asking a lot of questions. She makes dinner for him. All the while, the mom never comes over to meet her. Would you let your child hang out with some older woman you have never met? I'm sure people worry about their children and the company they keep, even in the midwest.<br /><br />The strangest situation of all is that Betta befriends a man of 20, with a very mean girlfriend. Betta, who is in her 50's, goes to Matthews and Jovannis house to keep them company and make them dinner. Not only that, but Betta asks her friend to go on a double date with Matthew and his girlfriend, to make the girlfriend jealous. Apparently, his girlfriend is envious of beautiful older women.<br /><br />Lastly, Betta deserted her friends 30 years ago. One day, out of the blue, she decides to reestablish their friendships. They welcome her back with open arms, no question.<br /><br />I could go on. If one aspect of the book is unrealistic, I could overlook it. But, when everything seems so perfect time and time again, I begin to wonder where the conflict seems to lie. The only thing that saved it was Berg's writing.

The first half of the book keep me reading into the night. It started out with a threesome, who wouldn't be interested in that? Nancy and her female friend \\"fake it\\" with each other at the expense of their male companion. He, of course doesn't know. She would do it \\"for real,\\" but why would you need to? The average john has no idea.<br /><br />We are then swept into the life of call-girls, their friends, and their shopping woes. Nancy has wanted to be a call-girl from the age of 10. First, a librarian, then a playboy centerfold, then a call girl. She ran away at 13 and lived with a strange boyfriend in London a year later, who used to lock himself (and sometimes Nancy) in a room with splitting headaches. Her history, her experiences, all of this was interesting.<br /><br />Until...<br /><br />The book started to take a different turn. She became very interested and obsessed with the lifeof her friend Allison. Why is Allison getting involved in this political thing for call girls? Why is Allison seeing Jack (a man we do not speak of anymore) on a regular basis? Why he is he paying for her education? All of a sudden, it wasn't about Nancy and her lifestyle anymore. The love scenes turned from juicy to ----wait, what happened? They were getting undressed, and now they are getting dressed?<br /><br />It was interesting that she was trying to hide her profession from her fiance and she felt pressured to marry him. How would she have her \\"dates\\" with her husband that didn't know about it. He thought she was a copy editor. I thought it was a little bit unbelieveable because what kind of person has no idea where you work or has never been there? I just don't think it's easy to keep secrets when you are going to marry the guy.<br /><br />Started out hot, then fizzled slightly.	2005-07-20

Charlotte is the youngest, in high school, daughter to Karen, who had her while she was in high school. She is only 33, but at times she \\"feels 60.\\" She is daughter to Nan, who is somewhat senile, but sweet and loving. They are all living in the same house. You know how three women under one roof can be.<br /><br />All is normal, except for one thing. Charlotte is more like her mother than she cares to be. She has found herself pregnant and the boyfriend is nowhere in sight. Will she follow in her mum's footsteps and have this baby, or take another road?<br /><br />Her \\"friend\\" Daniel is there for her all of the way. He seems to have ulterior motives, but who wouldn't? He is a sweet Napoleon Dynamite looking type character, but knows a lot about pregnancy and does a lot of research on the internet. (Also on how to please a woman.)<br /><br />This is a tale of growing up, getting along (or not) with your parents, and how women deal with each other.<br /><br />It was fun to read and quick, the only thing I had a hard time with was the fact that it takes you a minute to realize which character is talking. All of a sudden there is a star and I realized that the characters switched, but the only one that uses a different font is Grandma Nan. I kept confusing Karen and her daughter Charlotte.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-07-20

Sure, he's not the greatest writer, but I don't think he \\"dumbed it down\\" for anyone, I think that's just the way he writes. He never claimed to be a great writer, but he does know what he's talking about.<br /><br />It was a very quick read and it just reminded me of the things that I knew already but took me years to follow. He wasn't only talking about McDonalds, but fast food places in general. It scared me to read about the way people make fast food. He mentioned that he left a chicken sandwich at his friends office, and a year later it was still intact and looked as if it had been put there yesterday. It's obvious that fast foods are pumped with chemicals, the portions are much too large, and we don't get enough exercise.<br /><br />Children are developing diabetes and not playing outside anymore. French fries are the most eaten vegetable in America. (I can vouch for that, my nephews are given Mcdonalds fries quite often.)<br /><br />I think that Supersize Me the documentary along with this book gave me a nice little wake-up call. Don't eat so much fast food, get more exercise (I now run 3 times a week) and eat at home as often as possible. I try to eat organic fruits and veggies as often as I can.<br /><br />Recommended. I will pass it along to friends and family.	2005-07-10

I had a misconceived notion that this book was about infidelity, but it really dealt with the day to day frustrations of the \\"mother in law.\\"<br /><br />Ellie has a good life. She is about to marry the man that she loves. She has always wanted to create her own family, and nothing is going to stop her. Except, maybe...Linda. To anyone else, Linda (aka..mother in law) would seem like a perfectly normal woman. To Ellie, she is the beast that seems to get in the way of everything. She welcomes Ellie into the family, calls her often, and tries to make her feel at home. Ellie can't stand her and thinks that every move is a manipulative one to keep her away from her precious son.<br /><br />When Ellie gets pregnant and has the first grandchild, things proceed from bad to worse. Linda won't stay out of their lives and wants to see the baby constantly. Even though I didn't really find much wrong with Linda, Ellie constantly complains to Dan about what his mother does wrong.<br /><br />When an unexpected event threatens to tear them all apart, Ellie has to sit back and reassess the meaning of family and the life they created. Secrets will come out, and maybe Linda won't seem like such a \\"bad guy\\" after all.<br /><br />I thought that this was an interesting choice for a book. While most chick-lit stories are about finding and keeping a man, this one touched on family, intimacy, and overbearing parents. It was almost 400 pages, but read fairly quickly. I'm not sure if the author wanted us to hate the mother in law along with the main character, or we were supposed to feel sorry for her. At times, it appeared that Ellie was exaggerating about how irritating Linda was. After the last book that was only so-so, Jane Green has once again redeemed herself.	2005-07-05

It was a creative idea and that pulled me into the story.<br /><br />Martin has screwed up his life. He had a TV show, a wife, and kids.

He basically has to be looked after 24/7 and Maureen can't handle it anymore.<br /><br />Jess is young, lonely, and has recently been rejected by her newest guy. Her family life isn't the best either.<br /><br />JJ's band has never worked out, and he and his girlfriend aren't together anymore. That was the whole reason he came to London.<br /><br />All of these characters end up at Topper's House, the place where people go to jump off the roof and kill themselves. They become each other's guardian angels, so to speak. They will be there for each other and start their therapy sessions then and there.<br /><br />They make a point not to do it till a month later on Valentine's Day. Will it happen? Or will they grow as people, find their happiness elsewhere, and learn to live with the cards life dealt them?<br /><br />Though it seems that there were a lot of positive reviews for this book, I never really got into it. I was about halfway through when I realized it, and I didn't want to give up on it, because it's happened before that the ending completely changes a book for me. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here. I love Nick Hornby's books, and I will continue to buy/check out/read everything he puts out, but I wish I had enjoyed this one more.	2005-06-27

What she doesn't know, is that night, everything will change, and she will be forced to make a decision that will affect her life. Already having had the worst past you can imagine with an irresponsible mother and and loser boyfriends, Chyna has developed a strength that not many people have.

To see them everyday, in ordinary household items, or strangers on the street.

She obsessively read Challa's webpage and wrote mean, nasty things to her to bring her down.<br /><br />When Gert and her friends are not at bars trying to find men to date, they are having slumber parties obsessing about them.<br /><br />I loved the author's other work, \\"Carrie Pilby,\\" and maybe that's why I had such high hopes/standards for this one. Caren Lissner writes with originality through comedy or drama and I look forward to the next book.	2005-04-11

Robyn Sisman always seems to have good ideas for novels, and this one didn't follow through for me.<br /><br />Suze lives and works in London. She is a single, working woman and prefers it that way.<br /><br />Lloyd lives in New York, and has the once in a lifetime chance to trade apartments with Suze, because they both work at the same company. They do the exchange, and Lloyd brings his not-much-personality, extremely clean girlfriend who scowls at Suze's cluttery apartment and puts her cat to sleep. (not knowing it's her cat of course.)<br /><br />In the New York office, Suze is trained by one of Lloyd's co-workers, soon after, Lloyd loses his job because he (supposedly) passed information to their competitors. The only one that can save him is Suze. Can she help him get his job back?<br /><br />I didn't feel that the book was going anywhere. I liked reading about the different environments (London and New York) and how the author writes about those big city locales. Even though it was great that she tried to make it less about the \\"romance\\" and more about the \\"job-scene,\\" I was disappointed in the predictability and the fact that the main character (Lloyd) seemed unrealistic and not written well at all.<br /><br />I liked the last book, Weekend in Paris a little more than this one.	2005-03-07

Thank goodness, or I would have missed it-- having been placed in the \\"romance\\" section! I picked it up last night on a whim, needing something that would provide an original, lively story. How lucky I was to guess right!<br /><br />Mona lived in a commune in Montana where her family and others tried to create lives for themselves without counting on \\"outside\\" jobs and income. They lived off of the land, sold hand-made objects, and tried to create a peaceful world for their children.<br /><br />When tragedy strikes, Mona has no other choice but to move to San Diego with her \\"grammy,\\" in a house that could be compared to Gone with the Wind's \\"Tara.\\"<br /><br />Mona feels like her life or her personality has not brought her much excitement, but she receives the opportunity of a lifetime: to take an early retirement from her engineering job. Only then does she decide to \\"reinvent\\" herself, and marry the man of her dreams.<br /><br />Her best friend Greta tells her to look within for true happiness, but Mona ignores this advice and looks to Adam as her salvation. (he has done her taxes for seven years) Not having too much experience with men, Mona finds \\"The Dog,\\" aka Mike, who writes a column in \\"Maximum for Men\\" and he tells the truth about what men want from women. She hires this man as her coach. (while completely aware that this man acts like a misogynist) Suddenly, her life changes. She joins a woman's soccer league, takes a stripping class, and singing lessons, while trying to trap Adam into loving her.<br /><br />Have you ever felt that maybe you were in love with the *idea* of someone rather than the person himself? Have you ever wanted to be completely different, only to discover that your \\"real self\\" was already inside of you?<br /><br />Though I was a little disappointed with the \\"out there\\" scene during the musical, I was happy to know that hours flew by as I finished the book in two sittings.<br /><br />So far, she has written 2 out of 2 books that have satisfied me.

I had once read the Pigman in high school, unfortunately, this book doesn't measure up.<br /><br />Maggie and Liz are friends. Liz is a little more outgoing and popular, who sets Maggie up on a double date with her and Sean. Maggie goes out with Dennis who looks like an \\"undernourished zucchini...and always wearing the same baggy sweater.\\"<br /><br />Liz and Sean are very into each other, but Sean keeps pushing the issue with whether or not they are going to \\"do it.\\" When they get into a fight once again, Liz goes out with an older guy who practically rapes her. When Sean and Liz meet up again, she gives him what he wants, but... with a price.<br /><br />Even though the book was written in the late 60's, some underlying themes stay the same: pregnancy, abortion, not getting along or being able to communicate with parents, suicide, and premarital sex. It seems as though the author had covered everything...but...for a long while, the book just wasn't very interesting. It's a very quick read, but I didn't get into it until it was almost over. Also, I didn't get the closure I needed at the end between Liz and Maggie.<br /><br />It's a nice cautionary tale for students that are of high school age, but maybe I've read too much good Young Adult literature in the past to be impressed by this one.	2005-02-13

I had always seen it at my local library and the pink cover and picture with a girl snarling out the window at her mother was too difficult to avoid---it's obvious that most of us will be able to identify with this character!<br /><br />Claire's mom comes to visit out of nowhere and decides to stay, uninvited, on her couch. Claire is less than thrilled because her life is a mess already: She recently had been broken up with by the *perfect* man, she hates her job, she has no friends to speak of, and she and her mom clearly have issues. Her mother nitpicks incessantly, leaves personal and highly private notes with Claire's secretary, and still can't accept the fact that her other daughter Stephanie, is a lesbian, even though everyone else has.<br /><br />Can she survive a week or two with this woman staying on her couch without strangling her?<br /><br />Wendy French's quick wit and fun dialogue made me want to read more!

(3 1/2 stars)	I have a tendency to gravitate toward novels/short stories where women are the main characters. I found the title and cover interesting not knowing how the inside would turn out. I liked a little less than half of the stories, while the other half I could discard.<br /><br />One that stood out to me was the title story, \\"The Porno Girl.\\" It was different not only because a woman visited a shop where you could watch peep show videos for a quarter, but while she watched, she had her baby \\"strapped to her chest.\\"<br /><br />Skip forward to \\"daughters.\\" In this section, I was intriqued with the story \\"Waiting to Discover Electricity.\\" A girl becomes involved with the dad of the children she babysits.<br /><br />One of my favorites is \\"The Closet.\\" It features two sisters and a mom trying to avoid the dad's visit. He arrives in a Hummer, speaks through a megaphone while standing barefoot and yelling,  \\"Sound the alarm! All troops report to their stations! The mobilization has begun!\\" You don't have to read very far to figure out that something is seriously wrong with this man. Not only that, but what he did on the street toward the end shocked me.<br /><br />The last story of the collection called, \\"Solomon and his Wives,\\" caught my attention as a married woman of 5 years, more than befriends a man twice her age. It's not that I haven't read stories of this nature before, but those scenes were described in such a way that it pulled me in.<br /><br />My favorite story of the book would be \\"Helen of Alexandria.\\" A single woman is teaching at an all-girls school where many of the girls are from the \\"First Families of Virginia.\\" This seems to make them feel privleged and they try to take advantage of the teacher, who is less privleged and somewhat shy. It reminded me how catty and dangerous girls and women can be, especially when they are in groups.<br /><br />Even though I read quickly through the others, these stories mentioned had made me feel strange, and sometimes uncomfortable, but that's what I liked about them. They were realistic and not full of happy endings. I'm interested in this author's upcoming novel.and sometimes uncomfortable, but that's what I liked about them.

I read this book all the way from So Cal to San Francisco and back.<br /><br />Sarcastic with a biting sense of humor, Carrie Pilby is the perfect anti-heroine. The book takes on an interesting character study. She goes from one spectrum to the other: not needing anyone to realizing that being social is not half bad.<br /><br />Carrie's psychologist gives her a list of things to accomplish:<br /><br />1) List 10 things you love<br /><br />2) Join an organization/club<br /><br />3) Go on a date<br /><br />4) Tell someone you care<br /><br />5) Celebrate New Years<br /><br />To almost everyone, these tasks might seem fairly simple to finish. On the other hand, if you are a 19 year old prodigy who has skipped grades in school and doesn't quite seem to connect to many people, these items may seem taxing.<br /><br />She places an ad in the paper, looking for a \\"date,\\" and, at the same time, gets involved with a man who is \\"looking to have fun,\\" though he has a fiance who doesn't know about it.<br /><br />The more you read, you wonder if Carrie will be alone for the rest of her life. Or, will she let others in? She goes through a growth process, and by the end of the book, you may not recogize her.<br /><br />There were chuckling out loud parts to where I had to read passages to my driving companion. Her dry sense of humor kept me going. The end could have been a little less of a neatly tied bow, but I'll forgive her because it kept me entertained the whole ride through.	2005-01-11

Do you follow him, break up with him, or obsess about him?<br /><br />Emma Carter never had a chance, or a choice. Her boyfriend goes to California to be a script-doctor, possibly sell a screenplay, and leaves her, the newly titled \\"ex girlfriend,\\" all by her lonesome in New York.<br /><br />While surrounded by other couples who seem perfectly happy to be together, Emma plays it off and pretends that everything is wonderful between her and Derrick. People continually ask about her relationship status (like her mother who is on her third marriage) and want Emma to get married too.<br /><br />With \\"Sex and the City\\" type characters, Jade, who jumps in and out of every bed in New York and happy to do it, Rebecca, who seems the perfect girlfriend (and she hopes) soon to be wife, and Alyssa, who should be happy in her relationship but is starting to fall for her veterinarian instead, Emma is heartbroken and feels that she will never find love again. Or, will she?<br /><br />I gave it as many stars as I did because the author captured what it feels like to be heartbroken over a guy, and broken up with when you didn't see it coming. How everyone else seems more happy than you are and you just need to be with someone again!! I loved the quotes at the beginning of each chapter and the \\"confessions\\" sprinkled throughout the book.<br /><br />I didn't give it more stars because it seemed rather formulaic at times. Emma never seemed happy with herself on her own. (Of course, being heartbroken may do that to you) but there were some added subplots (with work and her alcoholic dad) that didn't seem to make it that much  more interesting. At times it became predictable and I wanted to finish it.<br /><br />All in all, it was pretty good and I will read Lynda Curnyn's books again.	2005-01-11

I usually don't read books like this, but the cover and previous reviews pulled me in.<br /><br />When Maya meets Ilan, it starts out so innocently. They don't even sleep together right away. Once they start to date, they never leave each other. They move in together, get a job at the same office, and their lives are forever intertwined.<br /><br />Their lovemaking starts to take many turns, once Maya finds out that Ilan cheated on her. She makes him promise: if they get married, he will be able to sleep with other women, but she always wants to be present when it happens. He agrees.<br /><br />He brings women into the bedroom, ones that look like like her, and weigh the same. She will have it no other way. The longer this goes on, the more adventurous they become, and the more inventive it is. It even starts to become dangerous.<br /><br />When a dramatic change enters Maya's life, she meets a mysterious woman that Ilan has picked out for her. This woman knows much about her and tries to be everything that Maya would want, but something is wrong. Will she go on being obsessed about her life with Ilan, or will she let a \\"new life\\" come into play?<br /><br />Part erotica, part mystery, this story also did not fail to make me wonder and make the temperature rise. Disturbing, yet titilating at the same time, I recommend it for late nights alone, or with another. I think I found a new genre that would be interesting to explore.	2004-12-26

Instead of putting out fires, he starts them. We find this out right at the beginning. It is not just regular fires he starts, but book fires. If they catch you with books, they will burn them, and maybe they will burn you. In this society, they don't want you to think.<br /><br />There are walls that speak to you, you can drive as fast as you want, billboards stretch out for hundreds of feet because they want to make sure that you still get advertisements drilled into your head. Is this in the future, or did Ray Bradbury know what our society was coming to?<br /><br />When Guy came home from work, he met up with a strange girl who was curious, charming, and not like anyone he has known. She put questions into his head, and he would never be the same. After their meeting, he started to sneak books into his house knowing what would happen if he were caught. The question is: should he risk his life for the sake of knowledge, or live like everyone else: happy but ignorant?<br /><br />The only problem I had with it (and I don't normally say this) was that it was too short. It ended so quickly, that I didn't see it coming. I read this book in highschool (like everyone else) but it had a different effect on me the second time around. I definitely recommend it, especially for book-lovers.	2004-12-26
US	49785275	R3TIVLF5VYR9VI	0743423526	764771953	Tunnel Vision	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Went a little long, but altogether enjoyable...(3 1/2 stars)	This almost 400 page book takes the time of an entire day starting at 5:00 in the morning. Andy leaves his flat early while his fiance Rachel quietly sleeps. He's supposed to leave on the Eurostar train with Rachel, at midnight, but he happened to make a bet with his \\"friend you love to hate\\" Rolf, who is a \\"tube enthusiast,\\" like himself.<br /><br />So, the bet goes like this. Rolf thinks that Andy cannot travel around the ENTIRE tube in a single day. Andy thinks that he can.  He is supposed to go around and take pictures of all of the signs, pick up envelopes that are taped to non-moving trains and behind soda machines, and finish before the Eurostar is supposed to leave. He is supposed to receive the last envelope from Rolf, which contains his tickets. Will he make it?<br /><br />Knowing the unpredictability of the London underground, this made for an original plot. There can be delays, accidents, people throwing themselves on the tracks. He can't take any overground transportation, it has to be the tube. If Rachel finds out about this bet, where he basically threw his marriage in the pot, would she still marry him? She tries to ignore his obsession with the underground, but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />All in all, it was fun to read about. It was very detailed and made me wonder if the author walked through his book, tracking down small details as he went. For a while, I was starting to wonder if it would become boring, following Andy through his travels all alone, but he met Brian, a homeless man who jumped on his coattails. Andy is annoyed with him at first, but the longer they are around each other, they start to form an unlikely friendship. Brian makes the story a little more readable.<br /><br />I didn't give it more stars because even though it was interesting, it wasn't engrossing, and I picked up and put down the book several times before I finished it. Maybe it was the length of the novel. Maybe, even though I'm obsessed with London and it's contents, that a book about traveling on the underground doesn't have enough drama for me. But, it was a nice ride, all the same.'s contents, that a book about traveling on the underground doesn't have enough drama for me. But, it was a nice ride, all the same.	2004-12-22

(3 1/2 stars)	A little more original than the boy-meets-girl chick-lit, this story is about three roommates who couldn't be more different.<br /><br />But speaking of men...<br /><br />Emma is very friendly (especially where males are concerned) and she keeps going back to her jerk boyfriend, Nick, hmmm...until someone new comes around.<br /><br />Jodine is the law student, no frills, uptight, and not all that emotional. She has been off and on again with Manny, who she couldn't care less about, but he worships the ground she walks on.<br /><br />Allie is the one they move in with. She is the 22 year old virgin, who is chasing after Clint, assuming that he is her \\"soulmate.\\" He has other ideas.<br /><br />The reason that this story is different, is because it doesn't center on single girls, looking for love (though one of them finds it.) It all starts when there is an accidental fire in the kitchen that gets out of control and the roomies need many thousands of dollars to get out of this predicament. (No one has renters insurance)<br /><br />They decide to throw parties at a local bar and get to keep some of the proceeds, depending on how many people they can get to come.<br /><br />They throw three parties in all (Halloween, New Year's, and Valentine's Day) and in those three parties, their lives, and they way they look at each other, will change.<br /><br />I liked the story because it moves fast, especially the more you read. Towards the beginning, I was trying to get through it. Usually, when you read a story about multiple characters, (and some extra characters thrown in) you don't care, much less remember, who is involved. But, I was able to follow all of the stories with no problem.<br /><br />Having said that...why didn't I give it more stars? For starters, it's very long. 360 pages long. If a book is going to be that long, it has to hold my interest throughout.<br /><br />I had a problem with the omniscient narrator. Sometimes, the author would go on random tangents that had nothing to do with the story. It was probably a tactic where she was trying to be funny, but it just didn't \\"fit.\\" It bothered me when the book was switching chapters back and forth between the characters. Like I mentioned above, I didn't have a problem following it, but, like other reviewers, the characterizations were not always consistent.

Also her dad: who is looking for a \\"slow bloom of affection,\\" and is continually running away from one of his psycho girlfriends Dolly, who thinks he is a \\"no-good alley cat.\\"<br /><br />I found the whole personal ad--finding love thing something to hold my interest at first, but Sarah doesn't like anyone and jumps back and forth between not-very-entertaining characters. I kept getting the names mixed up and found myself reading quickly to find something worthwhile. The other part of the book, she spends her time being lonely and hating her life because she is not as pretty as her co-worker, she has never been the \\"good looking sister,\\" and she just wants to be with someone again. I found myself feeling more and more sorry for this woman who wants to fill the void by \\"finding a man.\\"<br /><br />I was attracted to the book because the cover caught my eye: the title written in black curly handwriting, two cute puppies held on leashes by two pairs of legs, but maybe I shouldn't have judged the book by it's cover.	2004-11-07

I received this book as a trade on bookcrossing.com and all I knew about it, was that it was \\"chick lit,\\" one of my favorite genres. I could see how this book would offend some people. Two people meet, one of them is married, yet they continue to see each other. I was one of those people, but I chose to read it anyway. I feel that it's important, as a reader, to separate my personal feelings from the subject, and find a good story and writing within. I am happy to say that I did.<br /><br />Teri met Jamie on Platform 8 (in London) after falling down and having the insides of her briefcase scattered everywhere. As a true gentleman, he helped her up and even bought her some new stockings. Out of guilt and attraction, they shared a cab to their respective houses. He had yet to tell her that he was married, even though he knew that was something that should have been done.<br /><br />They continued to see each other every morning, she getting up earlier than usual to catch the train to work. After they had the \\"drink after work,\\" she discovered his marital status, and of course was crushed. They had both developed feelings for each other, and they still kept meeting every morning.<br /><br />Pamela, Jamie's wife and a stay at home mom starts to notice that there is something funny going on, late nights, less attention paid to her, and decides to \\"fake an affair\\" to get Jamie back. Will her made up extra curricular love activites drive Jamie into Teri's arms, or will she get him back? Will she find something that she has been looking for in her staged affair? The ending may surprise you.<br /><br />I liked that even though the book disagreed with my morals, it kept me locked into the story, and I really wanted to know what happened. Of course I was rooting for the family to stay together because the characters of Jamie and Teri could be irritating and unlikeable. But, then again, it could be my emotions talking because I didn't like how they built their relationship on a lie.<br /><br />It was a little bit longer than it should have been, but it was well written, and went beyond the usual boy-meets-girl, boy-wants to-be-with-girl-even-though-boy-is-married story.<br /><br />Recommended!ger than it should have been, but it was well written, and went beyond the usual boy-meets-girl, boy-wants to-be-with-girl-even-though-boy-is-married story.

She recently parted with her boyfriend of 6 years, her parents live in France, and her sister lives a couple hours away and is about to have a baby. Maggie has many secrets. She tells people that she works for Amex (American Express) but she actually has a job that she is ashamed of. There are things in her past that need to be kept private. She doesn't get close to anyone.<br /><br />While buying baby monitors for her sisters soon-to-come baby, she notices that they pick up on the frequency of her neighbors' monitors. From then on, it's like a fun soap opera she never knew existed. Libby and David also live in the building with their baby Charlie, and David wants to take a sabbatical off work and move to Cuba to learn Spanish.<br /><br />Libby, who had a life as a lawyer before she met David is not happy, but does it anyway. Maggie realizes that she can't let go of the psuedo-friends who don't know her...yet. She also picks up and moves to Cuba, while gently trying to invade their lives.<br /><br />At first, I started to think, this is a lonely, sad, girl. I did feel sorry for her, though she seemed slightly pathetic. She obviously has problems, and they eventually come to a head in Cuba. Will they befriend her? Even if they find out the horrible truths from her past?<br /><br />Emily Barr writes as someone who has been on a lot of adventures to exotic locales and keeps you interested throughout. I definitely recommend reading Cuba.	2004-09-06

(daughter of playwright, Arthur Miller) All of the stories have women at their center. Most of the stories are independent, but there are a couple that share characters. I have seen the movie, which only included three of the stories. This may have made me biased, since I got a visual of those three stories.<br /><br />Greta was about a woman who was planning on leaving her husband and has always had a problem with infidelity. She is always trying to impress her father, who left her mother when she was young. She is a cookbook editor who gets to edit a very popular authors book, and gets involved with him as well.<br /><br />Delia is a woman who leaves her husband, finally, after continued beatings. She goes from a woman's shelter to an old acquaintence's house. She grew up very promiscuous and hasn't changed that much.<br /><br />Louisa, who is also promiscuous, (I'm starting to notice a theme here) goes from lover to lover, and leaves when she starts to feel comfortable.<br /><br />Julianne and Bryna go hand and hand, as Bryna is Julianne's maid. Bryna imagines being interviewed and often talks to herself. She looks at Julianne as being this perfect woman who is married to a poet/writer 15 years her senior. Bryna always wanted to be glamourous, but instead, marries a farmer and lives with him and his strange mother.<br /><br />Nancy is a child who always has a nanny looking after her, but this nanny is also observing her, to see if she has anything wrong with her, because she once locked another girl in a closet.<br /><br />Paula is a woman who picked up a hitchhiker after being with a man  who traded places with her on the street and got hit by a car. She thinks that this will change her karma.<br /><br />I liked the way this author writes, because she shows rather than tells, and she writes very simply to tell a deep story.<br /><br />I liked certain stories more than others, some just grabbed me more, which is why it didn't receive a higher rating.<br /><br />Basically, it was a little better than ok, but I have read some collections that I like more.than others, some just grabbed me more, which is why it didn't receive a higher rating.  <br /> <br />Basically, it was a little better than ok, but I have read some collections that I like more.	2004-08-16
US	49785275	R2UPIPCSUJHNC5	0446692867	259444644	English as a Second Language	Books	2	9	17	N	N	Kept waiting for something to happen, and it didn't.	The premise sounded interesting---I was brought back to college, where I went to England for a semester. I met English boys, drank a lot, sometimes did my work, and I wrote it all in my journal. Maybe I should have published my journal, because it was more interesting and better edited than this book.<br /><br />The author, Megan Crane also spent time in England doing her Masters and PhD in literature, for 5 years, so she had some experience to draw from. But, I could only wonder what kind of a story she was trying to create with this book?<br /><br />The character Alex, who lives in Manhattan, moves to England to kill two birds with one stone: pursue her Masters degree and get back at an ex-boyfriend, one she really didn't care about in the first place. While she is there, she goes to the pub often, has some snog and shag experiences, stalks her teacher, and hangs out with her not-very-interesting friends. That's pretty much it.<br /><br />There is a tiny bit of drama, that didn't really go anywhere, I was waiting for some kind of a conflict that would add to the plot, but I started to lose hope for the book after about the first 100 pages. I was racing for the finish, but only so I could see if something really happened. Aside from some romance with her British friend and some drama with the girl that's stalking him, there is really nothing else going on in this almost 300 page book.<br /><br />The other few reviewers seemed to enjoy it, so mine is the minority opinion. Still, having a lot of recent experience with some good chick-lit, I would tell you to pass on this one.	2004-08-14
US	49785275	RENA3N4RKIYPP	0670032816	74215522	Children of God Go Bowling: A Novel	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Shannon Olson is back! (3/12 stars)	Said to be the sequel of Welcome to my Planet: Where English is Sometimes Spoken, Shannon Olson is back, with her character by the same name, in Minnesota, doing laundry at her parents house and going to therapy.<br /><br />I honestly don't remember much about the first novel, only that I liked it, and I found some connections with the character also being single, and contemplating about marriage and children. Only, she is on the other side. I wonder about it, and she obsesses about it.<br /><br />This character is very quirky and lonely, visiting her sister in Portland, hanging out with her mom (who is a very unique character, more like a sister) and passing the time with Ellie, her married friend, and Adam, her token-male friend from college who is also single.<br /><br />You might think that not a lot goes on in this novel. You would be right. It's mainly about the introspections of her everyday life, the fact that she goes to McDonalds too much, or takes in too much TV. A lot of things she figures out are helped along by her counselor and group therapy sessions. She's extremely neurotic and insecure, focusing too much on herself (I wonder how autobiographical it is, knowing that the main characters first and last name are also the same as the authors.) She has a tendency to be irritating, but at the same time, her sarcastic, dry-biting humor got me to chuckle out loud a few times. It's not life-changing, but it's honest.<br /><br />This book is for those readers who ever wonder what it would be like to change a friendship into something more, only for the friend in question to have a different perspective altogether. She also had a twist at the end that some people would not have seen coming.<br /><br />Fun at times, looking forward to her next book.	2004-08-05

I really wanted to like this book, because I really like Anna Maxted, whose book, Getting Over It, got me hooked!! I did not read Behaving like Adults or Running in Heels yet, but I found a kindred soul in this character, because she reminded me of me!<br /><br /> Hannah is in her early 30's, who, in the very first chapter, gets a proposal from Jason, her boyfriend of 5 years. Does she really want to get married? No, not really, but &quot;every woman likes to be proposed to, even if she means to refuse.&quot;<br /><br /> She has been married once before, at the age that most girls are starting out in college, to Jack, and she cheats on him. Somehow, this puts her off the marriage idea for a while, and she is kind of a committment phobe. She uses her Private Investigator (her job) ways to find out why she turned out this way. Which means, &quot;coming to terms with her past.&quot; That's it, her family. Her mom and dad have a couple of secrets, that she stumbles upon, and she realizes why everyone turns out the way they did.<br /><br /> I'm all for the &quot;become aware of your past, heal your present.&quot; I feel like that character in that way. Maybe it was because this book could have said what it said in 100 less pages. (It was almost 400 pages long.) Maybe it's also because we compare the authors works to the one that we read last, (in my case, Getting Over It) and it's hard to measure up. That book was very funny, this one only so-so. I always give an extra star or two for the premise, what pulled me in, and what the author was trying to do.<br /><br /> To me, this book was just OK, with a lot of not needed extra characters, but I look forward to Maxted's next effort!	2004-08-04

It's not that I thought I was the only one, but when people ask me why I have so many books that I haven't read, then I buy more, I answer, \\"I'm saving them.\\" They scratch their heads in confusion, not understanding why I have so many books in the first place. They just don't get it. But, Sara gets it.<br />Sara Nelson has been an editor and a reporter who has a library the size of my room. She is also a voracious reader. She looks for books that fit her \\"mood.\\" She wanders around her library in her nightgown knowing exactly where every book is. (Like I do.) She talks about how she wasn't always that way. She used to go to the \\"Multiplex\\" and go dancing.<br />\\"So when did my life change? Looking back, I can see the early warning signs of readaholism, like when my mother gave me Marjorie Morningstar when I was thirteen and I pulled an all-nighter reading--and weeping over--the Herman Wouk novel.\\" (Mine was around the same time, but not as grown up. Judy Blume's \\"Are you there God, it's me Margaret?\\" Doomed to turn any outdoor loving girl into an indoor one.)<br />Basically, she decided to read a book a week, and write how she felt about it. Now, this is not a book full of lists (which to me, is not a fun book to read, but more to make notes from.) This is a book that takes what she reads and she connects it to personal experience. She read books about baseball when her son was interested in baseball. She read books about Japanese Americans during WWII (because her husband is.) It makes so much sense. When I was in a bad place in a past relationship, I bought relationship books. When I was single, I bought single girl empowerment books. Now that I just want to enjoy books, I buy literature and chick-lit. Sometimes, we want to read what we know, or what we are experiencing at the time.<br />She talks about books that are overhyped, ones that really are not that great, but people talk about how great they are, and everyone wants to read them. The book is like a celebrity: the more exposure it has, the more famous it gets, no matter how much talent is there.<br />She talked about how when you are an adult, it's ok to STOP reading if you aren't into it. (I recently received similar advice from another reviewer who said that her mom told her she should read to her age, and stop if you don't enjoy it.) Does that work with me? If the book is really bad, which doesn't happen that often, I have stopped. But, sometimes I trudge through, hoping it will get better. But, why waste your time with something you don't enjoy? Were we taught that we had to finish the whole thing, because in school, we read it whether we liked it or not? Maybe you can try it a few years later. I got to chapter 13 in Brave New World when I was in the 12th grade. I couldn't finish. I was done. I faked my tests, and somehow made it through. 10 years later, I tried it again, and finished it. Not only did I finish it, I enjoyed it.<br />Basically, there is a lot more to this book than \\"Read this, don't read that.\\" She digs deeper, and inspires me to read some more! I hope that she writes about a 2nd year of passionate reading.

I really don't like instant messenging and email format when it comes to reading books, but I decided to take a chance anyway.<br />The beginning was slow and confusing. You are introduced to all of these annoying people, who are having sex in chat rooms. Basically it goes like this: Literoticus was supposed to become a place where people would discuss big ideas about art, literature, and life. How wrong they were.<br />Lisa is an oversexed, stay at home mom who met her husband at her father's funeral, ran off with him, and married him two weeks later. At that moment, she knew it was a mistake.<br />Tag is hardworking husband and dad who finds himself attracted to \\"Lisa33\\" and tries to get to know her, through messages and email. (This WHOLE book takes place with im's and email, just to let you know. There is not one phone or face to face conversation throughout.) He starts to fall for her. She falls for him. Neither one knows what the other looks like, has eachother's address, or phone number. All of it is very annonymous and impersonal, except where the cyber-sex is concerned.<br />And a lot of cyber-sex there is, with Lisa and Tag, and with the other participants that communicate through the website. Through all of the lies, deceit, and drama the others seems to create for themselves, Tag and Lisa seem to find a real connection and want to be together. But, will they step out of the safety net, leave their spouses, and actually do it?<br />The reason that I gave it as many stars as I did:<br />I really liked the email stories, particularly the ones that Tag wrote Lisa. He talked about how he first met his wife, a little girl he once knew, and some sexual \\"fantasies\\" involving Lisa. (Those did the job for me as well.)<br />A previous reviewer talked about how the conversations in the book were based on stereotypes. When I was 19, I was pretty involved with AOL. Chat was becoming popular. I became addicted and was talking to people across the United States that I would never meet. So many strangers, that I can't even remember the names now. It's very real. Unfortunately. It's also true how many of them want to \\"cyber.\\" So, I think that this author caught that environment quite well.<br />Why I didn't give it more stars:<br />I didn't like how it ended. I was looking forward to seeing what happened (and I was imagining all of the things that COULD happen) but it didn't work. It didn't go anywhere.<br />I found a few typos. Maybe this is not the authors fault, but where was the editor? They were little things, but not little enough for me not to notice.<br />All in all, I liked how all of the things you thought about the characters at the beginning, did a 180 at the end.

I started reading this book at 11:00 PM---bad idea---I was up for two more hours, and had to force myself to go to bed!<br />Nick Clifford finds himself married after only dating Trish for two months. He knows her almost as little as we do, as we start reading. She seems fun and beautiful, and very interested in pleasing her man. All seems perfect, until page 14, when we realize that Trish is not the most faithful wife.<br />\\"She doesn't know the man with her, doesn't know why she let him buy her a drink at the hotel where they're both staying, doesn't know why she came to his room when the bar closed. She especially does not know why, when he kissed her in the bar, with his dark good-smelling skin, she didn't really resist.\\"<br />Maybe this was the part that really threw me for a loop. I assume that people who cheat, at least feel guilty about it. She goes with her emotions, whichever way they fall. \\"What happened, in this second week of her marriage---does she feel bad about it? How can she? It has no connection to her real life.\\" (Unfortunately, like many others, this is how people rationalize their little affairs.)<br />She comes home, knowing that she is not going to tell him. Why would she? He is loving, sweet, the kind of man that a lot of women say they want, and then go for the bad-boy instead. (Except for me, of course)<br />She finds that she is pregnant (hopefully by Nick, we never really find this out) and they are like the perfect couple \\"he is aswirl with joy, but too full of it to feel it as joy. He loves this women, easily to death and past it.\\"<br />She sees her ex-boyfriend of 6 years, someone who really treated her badly in the past, and tries to get her back, knowing she is pregnant. It took her a few weeks. Just when you think she is going to stay with Nick, she leaves him for Joe.<br />After her baby, it gets more complicated. Nick is the greatest father on earth. Even though he moves to New York for half of the time (they live in London) he comes back often, has sleepovers with his baby, and proves to really love his daughter Charlotte, and she loves him as well. Does Trish ever stop sleeping with Nick? Does he want her to? Does Joe know? Does he care? These are the questions that get answered in this immediate page turner (almost) all the way till the end!<br />I realized that it's not so much the plot that sucks you into this novel. It's the author's style of writing. He makes you think, read back on what he's wrote just to make sure you have read it right, and the sizzling sex scenes.

Molly Clearwater is a secretary for Malcolm Phipps at a pharmaceutical company in London. He invited her to a weekend conference (in Paris no less) and she delightfully took him up on his offer. Even though he had never tried to get anywhere before, she overheard two women in the bathroom talking about why he is taking her there. After that, with no other explanation provided, she assumes the worst, and sends him a resignation email. Even though her reaction was a little impulsive  and short-sighted, it turns out that she made the right decision.<br />As she is deciding just to go home and decide what to do now-- she chucks it all and takes a train to Paris instead, with a little intermediate French knowledge under her belt. Why shouldn't she be able to have some fun? Not telling anyone where she is going, (since they assumed she was going there anyway) she's off, and manages to find a Paris hotel late at night.<br />Obviously something has to happen since Molly doesn't know anyone, right? Well, Alicia knocks on the door, looking for Janine who has &quot;done a runner with her rollerblades,&quot; from the company she works for. They are fast friends, as this black haired Australian pushes her way into the room. All of a sudden, they are out in Paris, enjoying each other's company.<br />They are out at a club, and Molly meets Fabrice, a French artist of course!! He takes her for a ride on his scooter, and she falls in love! (Her naivete can get a tad bit annoying at times)<br />Though the ending was not predictable, (thank goodness) she meets a man who turns out to be someone she has been searching for all of her life!!!

I had never heard of Karyn Bosnak before I read her book. (Maybe I don't watch as much TV as I thought I did.) I was just looking to read some good chick lit. I had no idea that it was based on a true story.<br />Karyn moved from Chicago, Illinois to Manhattan, New York to be a TV producer. She once worked for the Jenny Jones show. Like many Americans, she was looking for a new life, identity, and of course, to make some money. Which she did. She made about 8,000 a month working on a Court show, but spent it faster than she earned it. Her rent was 1,800 dollars a month, she discovered Bloomingdales and Gucci, personal trainers, pedicures, etc. You name it. She spent money on it.<br />At first, it seems that she was rationalizing everything she spent her money on. &quot;I made a vow to use it (Amex card) only for emergencies and this was an emergency!... I would charge the shoes, and then walk to and from work every day for a month. Since the bus was 1.50 either way, I'd save myself $60 in a month.&quot; ...and so on and so on.<br />After a while, you could tell that her spending got out of control. She didn't even rationalize anymore. She basically was looking for a way out. She had run up about 20,000 dollars in debt from credit cards alone. She started to do something called a Buy and Return Credit Payment Management Plan where, if you buy something, then return it, it will credit the card, and then she won't have to pay the full balance until the next month. (Apparently, the credit card she had makes you pay off a full balance every month. Could you imagine paying off a 20,000 dollar balance in one shot?)<br />She realized that she had to downsize a little. She moved to Brooklyn with a roommate, started using drug store makeup instead of department store makeup, and tried to pinch pennies, all while paying off credit cards. It wasn't easy though. She lost a couple of different jobs (that's how television is, I guess) and needed a miracle.<br />Jokingly, her roommate told her that she should put a sign out that says she needs money, kind of like a panhandler. Later, she took him seriously and started a website, called SaveKaryn.com. She basically asked people to donate money, told the truth why she needed it, and sold some of her &quot;expensive&quot; items on ebay as well. Did it work? You'll find out when you read it!<br /><br />Also, with with every positive reaction from people, she received  negative ones as well. This is where I was shocked. There were people that called her an idiot, a fat pig, a liar, a cheater, etc. Someone actually threatened to come to her house and shoot her. Yes, I believe that what she did wasn't the smartest thing (charging everything and running up debt.) But, I don't know a lot of people who HAVEN'T been there. I myself owe money on credit cards from books, movies, and I was dumb enough to put my college terms on a credit card. Basically, people shouldn't be so judgmental. I think that the real problem is people are angry with her because she did what others wish they had thought of. She is asking for help, getting a lot of news and radio coverage because of it, wrote a book, and there might be a movie. So, instead of being jealous, they should just go out there and do it themselves.<br />Now, would I have donated to her website if I found it earlier? Probably. I believe in karma and random acts of kindness. Plus, I give a dollar to a homeless person once in a while, or give food on the street if someone doesn't have any. The only difference between them and Karyn is that they aren't as lucky. But, maybe they ended up there for the same reasons. You never know.<br />Anyway: about the book:<br />* It was entertaining, somewhat funny (she is not AS funny as she likes to think she is, but her responses to the &quot;mean&quot; people's letters are pretty good. You can tell that she put thought into them.)<br />* Her writing needs a little work and a little more editing. I know she probably wantsto be looked at as &quot;cute and quirky,&quot; but some of her vocbulary and writing style can be just plain annoying.<br />* I read it in about three days. It was very interesting (and stressful) to see someone get in and out of that mess.<br />* While I would never duplicate what she did, I don't have a problem with it. If you like it, donate. If you don't, go somewhere else.<br />Enjoyable!wants to be looked at as &quot;cute and quirky,&quot; but some of her vocbulary and writing style can be just plain annoying. <br />* I read it in about three days.

His essays range from interesting to hilariously funny. He has a way with words that cannot be duplicated.<br />\\"Us and Them\\" had to do with his neighbor and family who did not own a TV, and how David used to spy on them and wonder how they lived and learned about life, if they didn't have a television. These neighbors went trick or treating the day after Halloween, (as they were on vacation the day before) and David was forced to go upstairs and fetch some candy to give to the kids. Instead, his mom found him in his room, mouth dripping with chocolate. One of my favorites.<br />\\"Full House\\" had to do with sleepovers and the fact that their parents don't go to bed at a normal time, so the children didn't either. I laughed out loud when he talked about his mother, who falls asleep anywhere, and didn't understand why they gave her a nightgown for Christmas, \\"...she'd look at us strangely, as if, like the moment of one's death, the occasion of sleep was too incalculable to involve any real preparation.\\" You find out more about his mother in this story as well. In the last story, she locked the children out of the house and they threw snowballs at her window. In this essay, she gossips about the neighbor's mom. \\"'What is she on?' my mother would whisper whenever we passed Mrs. Winters waving gaily from her front yard.\\" I found her to be more of a friend to the kids than a mother, maybe a little dysfunctional.<br />\\"Blood Work\\" was probably my favorite. David starts cleaning houses, and goes to an apartment where a very sweaty man resides, who is not in favor of air conditioning. He continually talks about FIRE ISLAND in a very loud voice, \\"...as if it were a prearranged code, the watchwords signaling me to hand over the microfilm.\\" As David starts to find gay pornography piled about the apartment, and wonders why the guy asks if he is coming to clean at 2PM or 2AM, he slowly catches onto the fact that this guy didn't just want any housecleaner. He watches a \\"movie\\" and pleases himself in David's presence, then proceeds to pay David $230 dollars for his services, even though he didn't \\"service\\" him, as this was a mixup in cleaning services.<br />A previous reviewer stated that she had a bad feeling about a couple of the stories, because she thought that there was some underlying pedophilia going on. She didn't go into detail, but mentioned what stories she was suspicious about. In \\"The Girl Next Door,\\" a neglected 9 year old girl hangs out with 26 year old David much like the character Marcus hangs out with Will, in Nick Hornby's \\"About a Boy.\\" I didn't see any problem in that book, and I don't see any problem here.<br />In \\"Chicken in the Henhouse,\\" David discussed how a young boy was in a hotel getting coffee for his parents, and naively asks David for help, as any child might do. David then worries about how people might \\"think\\" it looks, mixed with the fact that sometimes he has a need to touch people's heads. (It sounds more like an obsessive compulsive disorder than closet pedophila, but that's just my opinion.) I just think that if he was, he wouldn't be publicly announcing it in a book. It just bothered me that this reviewer made him look like something bad because of her own suspicions. I don't agree.<br />All in all, it was a quick read.

In this case, it was OK.<br />Alice has known Joe most of her life. He was her brother's friend, and completely out of her league.<br />Years passed, and they met again, when she had a thriving catering business. One thing led to another, and they got married. Sounds perfect, doesn't it? Only problem: Joe has a bad habit. He cheats. A lot. Alice knows nothing about it. Will she ever find out? Or will she be doomed to unhappiness in her marriage while Joe plays all he wants?<br />The reason that I gave it the rating I did, was because much of the book talked mostly about the above synopsis, with a few extra characters, and some light flirting on Alice's side. The conversations had a tendency to be cheesy at times, especially while flirting. They just didn't seem realistic. The reason that I didn't give it a lower rating, was because it was a quick read, and somewhat entertaining, just not her best.<br />Note: Some people were upset by this, but I thought it was known. In the UK, Spellbound is the exact same book as US To Have and To Hold. I don't know why the change of title, but thought I would let you know.<br />Still looking forward to Green's next effort!	2004-06-29

It starts out with a cold night in February, in Trafalgar Square in London, with Louise and her husband going to a photo exibition where his mother was once a model. This is somewhere that Louise does not want to be, and of course she doesn't. Her mother in law Mona, who is elegant and beautiful in her advancing years, treats Louise like she is a frumpy nothing. In a way, she is, at least to the outsiders.<br />She is overweight and self-conscious, an American married to a British man who calls her pumpkin which she doesn't like, and doesn't care about her looks. But, he is also not the most loving man. He met her when he was trying to escape his &quot;other&quot; life, and she saved him from it. Unfortunately, she was not saved.<br />She stumbles upon a book entitled: &quot;Elegance,&quot; by Genevieve Antoine Dariaux, which is a real book. She has allowed the author of this book to use bits and pieces from her own. Every few chapters or so, in alphabetical order, Madame touches on ways to give yourself style and class. She touches on accessories, beauty,  daughters. &quot;The more simply a little girl is dressed...the more chic she is.&quot; She feels the same way about Quanity/Quality. &quot;...she buys very few garments: her goal is to possess a single perfect ensemble for each of the different occasions in her life, rather than a wide choice of clothes to suit every passing mood.&quot;<br />Louise starts to use this book as her bible, slowly changing her appearance and attitude, and others start to notice. Of course, when you start to alter your life, some people aren't always as happy as you are. Her husband, for example, was annoyed that she wanted to change. She didn't know why he cared so much to begin with, when he didn't care about her looks in the first place. But soon, we find out that his &quot;other&quot; life, that we thought was gone, reappears.<br />She soon moves in with two friends, and her real life begins. She is likeable aside from her &quot;food issues,&quot; and even though the ending is a tad bit predictable, it was still an enjoyable book.

Ellie is a &quot;good&quot; girl who always washes off her makeup, writes thank you notes, and sends Christmas cards. Being this kind of girl, it is extremely hard to break up with a man. In this first chapter, this is what she is struggling with. Breaking up with (another) boyfriend who just doesn't seem right for her.<br />Sooner than later, she runs into a new man. 20 something years her senior, his dog nuzzles up to her dog, and she's in love. She goes on a first date with him, and still has a thing for him, even after he guesses that she is 10 years older than she really is. Unfortunately, it doesn't go so well when he finds out what her age really is.<br />Fortunately for Ellie, his attraction to her doesn't cease, and he comes back for more, even though his morals keep trying to keep him away. He thinks that dating younger women is wrong, and as a newscaster, he wants to keep a professional reputation. There is also the matter of the ex wife, who doesn't like to see any woman take her place.<br />Quick, fun, and laugh out loud funny at times, this is a good summer book and only took me a couple of days to finish!	2004-06-29

(3 1/2 stars)	I usually don't give half stars, but I feel that it was almost good enough to be a 4, but not quite.<br />Elizabeth Berg can always be counted on to discuss the deeper issues in life, and describe them in a way, that makes you want to drink in her writing. She touches on alleged abuse, the makeup of families, and even death in this story. Her books are always quick, I can usually finish them off in no more than 3 or 4 sittings.<br />It starts out with a memory of three siblings: Steve, Laura, and Caroline. The year is 1960, and they are going to the fair. This short chapter was describing how Laura and her sister were not really close, no one is really close to Caroline. She is too hard to understand. She is a &quot;brownnoser,&quot; someone who is always giving their mother gifts.<br />Fast forward forty years. Out of nowhere, Caroline wants to talk to Laura and Steve, about some things that have happened in the past, things that have been bothering her. These are things that their mother may have done. Both Laura and Steve are dumbfounded, because they weren't aware of anything in the past that was less than pleasant.<br />As the story unfolds, we realize that there may have been abuse that went on with Caroline and their mom. Even though they start remembering things that do not fit perfectly with their sugar-coated memories, Caroline is still Caroline. Who do you believe? The woman who loved and cared for you all of these years, or your dramatic and difficult sister? As the secrets unfold, you realize who is telling the truth, and who wants to hide from the past.<br />Even though I wasn't that satisfied with the way the book ended, I am always pleased with Berg's style. Though others have described her as &quot;too wordy,&quot; I feel that, that is the most beautiful part of her works. The pieces that pull you into the story and these character's lives. I recall one paragraph,<br />&quot;...Maybe it was the tender irony of the way that we, blind ourselves, offer our arm to others, hoping to ease the crossing. Maybe it was the odd surges of love one can feel for an absolute stranger. Or maybe it was the way we give so little when it's in us always to give so much more.  Thomas Merton wrote about feeling a sudden awareness of a profound connection to others, understanding that 'they were mine and I theirs.' I loved reading things like that, things that pointed to our oneness and, by extension, our responsibility to others.&quot;<br />It's the fact that she is my magnifying glass to the beauty in life, the armchair philosopher, full of wisdom, that keeps me coming back.ffer our arm to others, hoping to ease the crossing.

After reading \\"How to be Good\\" and thinking it was only ok, I decided to try my luck at this one.<br />I will give Nick this, he is always funny. This book went by very quickly.<br />Will is in his mid-thirties and lives off of his dad's one hit wonder song called, \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\" What else does he do? Not much. He basically does all of the things that we do in our down time (those that have jobs) read, sleep, watch tv, visit with friends, work out, go out to eat, and so on. He didn't find anything wrong with it really, and he understands that women may not always be that attracted to him because of the lack of ambition he carries, whether or not he is a good looking man.<br />He stumbles upon a single mom who feels that she does not have enough to offer him, and realizes that he has struck gold. They (single moms) are this hidden resource that he never knew existed! He doesn't have to spend every waking moment with them (because they have less time) great sex, and he looks like this good guy because he thinks it's hard for them to find men to date that will put up with the fact that they have children!<br />He starts going to these single parent meetings S-P-A-T (Single Parents Alone Together) and tries to gain access to all of the single moms only to find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be. But, what he ends up getting out of it, is something that he never knew existed---a life. He meets Marcus, who is the son of a depressed single mom who cries almost every day. He strikes up a frienship with Marcus, who shows him that maybe it's better to give and receive, instead of just receive. He finds meaning in life when he never knew there was any.<br />A touching book, and at times, laugh out loud funny. I'm looking forward to Hornby's next effort!	2004-05-03

I once tried to read Rachel Cusk's &quot;Saving Agnes,&quot; but for some reason, I didn't take to it. I assumed that it was because I was less experienced in reading books that are similar to her style, and vowed to try again.<br />I picked up &quot;The Lucky Ones,&quot; took it home, and realized that it was made up of five short stories. I don't read them that often, but am always looking for books that will pull me into that genre.<br />I was pleased. Cusk's writings are &quot;show,&quot; rather than &quot;tell,&quot; as if you are in this persons body, feeling the things they have felt.<br />&quot;Confinement,&quot; is about a woman who is imprisoned for (possibly) killing her children.<br />&quot;The Way you Do It,&quot; is about some couples and singles that go skiing in the Swiss Alps, and one man, Martin, who has recently had a baby with his girlfriend. It seems that all the others care about is if she is breastfeeding, and it appears that he is trying to find his old life again.<br />&quot;The Sacrifices,&quot; is about a woman who goes back to the home she grew up in and remembers the life that she and her family shared, while trying to understand her present. She is raising another man's child, while living in close proximity to her twin-sister Lucy, who is her complete opposite.<br />&quot;Mrs. Daley's Daughter,&quot; was one of my favorites. Mrs. Daley is miserable, and tries to make everyone around her miserable as well. She seems to be constantly complaining about her past and her husband (what he didn't do for her) and is jealous of her daughter, who has what she would have wanted for herself. She makes every effort to insult her daughter, who either takes it in stride, or doesn't realize what Mrs. Daley is doing.<br />The last story (my favorite) is called &quot;Matters of Life and Death,&quot; about a stay at home mom who got into a car accident and befriends a neighbor Serena Porter, who writes a column about &quot;life&quot; in the newspaper. She seems to be very independent, yet only  writes about her life with her children. Meanwhile, her husband is dying of cancer.<br />I really enjoyed the book. I will have to read it again to make the connections of each character that went from one story to another. I didn't realize that all of the characters were somehow connected until I was half-way through. She writes with such rich, lyrical language that keeps you locked into the stories the whole way through.<br />Recommended!er.

I was walking around the bookstore, and this book popped out at me! I'm not normally an art fan, but I'm big on pop culture, and I had to pick it up to look at it!<br />I found it a strange book, which I loved. It's just filled with ordinary and not so ordinary items that we may have used ourselves. (or not)<br />Example: Do you remember Squeez-its? I remember drinking those juices in elementary and junior high. What happened to them?<br />There were Japanese \\"blood type\\" condoms that are said to sell 2 million every year in Japan.<br />One very interesting item I found was \\"Doti,\\" which is hardened termite excrement, believed to give strength because they are rich in minerals. Women in Zambia eat it during their pregnancy.<br />One very disturbing picture I found was of an Aryan doll that KKK members give to their children to play with. One good thing I read was that the membership is dwindling, from five million in 1920, to two thousand, five hundred in 1998. Not perfect, but getting better.<br />Basically, it's a good small coffee table book that will generate some interesting conversations. It's written in French and English. I think that it would be good for all cultures to read, in order to understand each other better.<br />Don't forget to look up the \\"edible cow pie!\\" Which is really chocolate, caramel, and pecans, which is destined to turn some heads.	2004-04-15

Of course I'm going to buy the two books together, the first one was so interesting!<br />On the cover, shows some Petrodex, which is toothpaste for dogs, something that I actually used in the past! It gives some useful information that not everyone knows, which is: if you don't brush your dogs teeth often, it can lead to gum---AND heart disease. If you buy them toothpaste, don't forget to buy &quot;music for healthy pets,&quot; which has a cute puppy on the cover. The Japanese veterinarian Norio Aoki claims that, &quot;Cheerful but serene music is good for dogs and romantic music is good for cats.&quot; I wonder how he found that out. Keeping with the pet theme, don't forget &quot;Thirsty Dog!&quot; It's a pet drink in crispy beef flavor, and fish flavor for cats. Who knew?<br />I thought that the &quot;teddy bear passport,&quot; was really cool. Basically, they started being handed out to children to keep abductions from happening by parents who don't have custody. Now, Japanese, British, and Australian babies have to have them. There are two teddy bears on the cover, and their are instructions inside how to keep &quot;teddy&quot; safe.<br />Of course, just like the last book, it shows the ugly side of things. There is a &quot;Kaba Kick,&quot; Russian Roulette for kids. You point the gun at your head and pull the trigger. If the gun doesn't fire, and the pair of feet don't kick out, you win points. Disturbing.<br />One more I found was the &quot;Battered Doll.&quot; Basically, it's this smiling doll with missing teeth, a bandaid on his cheek, a bruise on his forehead, and a black eye. It claims that, &quot;physical and psychological abuse is a serious problem in Spain.&quot; Psychologists have said that &quot;if they (children) see a battered child, they won't find it alarming. They get used to holding it, find it cute, and this desensitizes them.&quot; I couldn't believe this but, they tried to ban it, and they failed!<br />Once again, this book is in English and French and gives you a little peek into other cultures and their daily home items.

She writes an original book, and then emails people who may be interested! Otherwise, I may have never known about this book!<br />At first, I was very repelled by the main character, Prudence. She seems to have no redeeming qualities, she cheats on her husband, tells her new boyfriend that her old husband is dead, and agrees to marry the new guy, while her poor &quot;nice guy&quot; husband Reilly is back at home in New York with no knowledge of any of it... yet.<br />I realize, we are supposed to dislike this character! Because, like all of us, she is not perfect. She is somewhat of a self-serving narcissist, who gets collagen, botox injections, and an eye lift, wears blue eye contacts, all before she hits 40. But, does she get what she deserves at the end? Or, will she get the man of her dreams, and get to &quot;recycle&quot; her husband to another lonely woman through the personal ads, all the while, having her cake and eating it too?<br />It didn't take me that long to find out because I was forcing myself to stay awake for this one!

I thought that this book was very interesting when I picked it up, because I had never seen anything like it! Even the author states:<br />\\"Do you remember the day one of your parents sat you down to have a serious talk about advertising? Me neither.\\"<br />Basically, no one really teaches you about this stuff. I remember that in seventh grade, one of my favorite subjects was called, \\"Propaganda.\\" It taught you about how advertisers use good looking people to sell products, or how they compare against other products. It was interesting, but didn't last very long! You usually learn about it yourself and by that time, you are up to your eyeballs in debt!<br />The book looks at both sides of the story. It points out how advertisers try to get your attention and may do things that aren't always ethical, but it also points out the facts.<br />There are some sections called \\"Try this at home!\\" Basically, these are exercises to make people more aware of the advertising around them. One suggests to look around your environment and see if the melting pot of society exists on your TV or in commercials. Chances are, it doesn't. On another section similar to this, the book asks you to look at the ingredients on a \\"brand name\\" product and a \\"no name\\" product and see if the ingredients are the same. Usually, they have similiar contents but people are more familiar and feel more comfortable with the brand name. So, we are more likely to buy it.<br />Towards the end of the book, there is a section that gives you information on how to speak out about what you think may not be right. If you are offended by something that is advertised to you, it suggests that you write to the company, because writing is taken more seriously than a phone call. There are also resources in the back on how to get a hold of companies and organizations that can continue to help you in your quest!<br />Must read for pre teens and teenagers alike!	2004-02-26

I am familiar with Meghan Daum having been part of the &quot;Self&quot; generation, and I have always liked her honest, witty articles in that magazine. I was tempted to read her book for that reason, and to be honest, I liked the idea of taking yourself out of the rat race, to try to find something more meaningful. The concept worked, but the book was a little shaky for me.<br />  Lucinda Trout was a 20 something &quot;Lifestyle Correspondent&quot; who went to Prairie City orginally to interview meth addicts who were also housewives. Apparently, they would do it, lose weight, and even have a very clean house. Lucinda fell in love with the simplicity of the place, the natural beauty, and said goodbye to New York, at least for a year, so she could broadcast her &quot;Quality of Life Report,&quot; to New Yorkers, to show them that it is possible.<br />  While she is there, she meets Mason, a 40 year old &quot;Jeremiah Johnson/Brad Pitt&quot; type, and finds herself intrigued by him, so she accepts his proposal to go out sometime. This man has three kids by three different women, and lives in a little cabin in the woods.<br />  So, she starts to date him and ignores other men that have been interested in her. She starts to get acquainted with his kids, and before you know it, they move in together! Unfortunately, this is where I started to lose interest because the book starts to drag in unimportant scenes and details.<br />  Such as: Lucinda starts to get involved with this women's group talking about &quot;empowerment&quot; and reading inspiring books. Mason starts to develop a &quot;problem,&quot; but Lucinda stays with him and doesn't seem to be quite affected by it. She doesn't have too much of a life after that, and her boss Faye's (5'11 and weighing 119) emails are irritating because they are trying to say that she's illiterate. I got that point a long time before. There is also too much obsession with weight in this book and too many stereotypes: about midwesterners, about lesbians, and about people in general, which started to grate on my nerves.<br />  I gave it three stars because I spent a couple hours in a coffee shop engrossed in the first 150 pages, but after that, I kind of lost the point of the whole book (and maybe she did too.) I will read her books (or essays) again, but I wished that this one had held my interest.rs, about lesbians, and about people in general, which started to grate on my nerves. <BR>   I gave it three stars because I spent a couple hours in a coffee shop engrossed in the first 150 pages, but after that, I kind of lost the point of the whole book (and maybe she did too.)

The author of this book, Barbara Feldon, was once on the series Get Smart, as the spy \\"99.\\" She has been through a divorce and even though she started out nervous and felt lonely, she was able to live alone and finally appreciate it.<br />I was attracted to this book. I am always drawn to the books that emphasize how being \\"single\\" or \\"alone\\" is not a scary thing. In today's society, from friends or family, you are constantly pushed to be with another person, to get married or have kids. Even though this is everyone's right, it isn't the answer for everyone.<br />I was expecting a guided list of how to live alone and love it. This was not what was within the book. It was full of wisdom and life lessons. On some parts, I felt as though she were reading my mind what I was never able to verbalize.<br />She writes: \\"Living alone gives us the freedom to nourish the things we love wihtout the constraints of a partner's timetable or his or her conflicting desires.\\" This is not to say that we can't fulfill our hobbies or our dreams with someone else there. I think the problem is that we become distracted with taking care of this other person, like having a constant guest in our home. When you live alone, there seems to be more time to get to know yourself and what you love.<br />This is not a \\"don't get involved with others in a romantic way.\\" It's quite the contrary. Some people are deeply fulfilled by another person sharing their life, and others have too much they want to fulfill on their own. She writes. \\"...a love life is not a need like food and air, it's a desire. If we don't eat or breathe, we die; we don't die from unsatisfied passion. Having to set aside romance from time to time is only tormenting if we choose to view it that way.\\"<br />I loved this passage. \\"I learned that there are ways to experience romance outside of sexual possession. I had savored for the first time what the sixteenth-century essayist Montaigne called 'passionate friendship': one that is deeply loving, unconditional, and heightened to the level of poetry. We delighted in each other's company, expressed ourselves freely, and brought out the best in each other. Not all conventional relationships call make those claims. There were so many delights that the lack of a sexual component wasn't felt as a deficit.\\" I have experienced this very thing, but I couldn't describe it. There are more ways to connect than just with one person. We connect with people all of the time, but sometimes, we are too busy to notice, or don't put our finger on it why it felt so good to have a passing conversation with a stranger or acquaintance. You will never be lonely if you don't put yourself out there. (Spoken from a true introvert, who also tends to be shy as well.)<br />Does this mean that I won't couple up? No, I have a boyfriend. Does this mean that I would never get married? No, not exactly. What does this mean? The significance for me is that someone echoes my true feelings about being single. It's not evil, it's not lonely, it's just something that is easier to handle when you are comfortable and love yourself. It also gives you more time to travel around the world which I hope to do someday. If I find myself single again, I hope that I take advantage of all the things single life offered me.is deeply loving, unconditional, and heightened to the level of poetry.

I checked this book out from the library, interested in this whopping 500 page book! I had heard about the author from her Educating Esme book. I was interested in what she had to say, being a teacher myself. This book is quite inspiring, for children, teachers, and parents alike!!!<br />I am obviously a huge advocate for children being surrounded by books and as well as ordering from scholastic every month, I scan the titles at the local bookstores, hoping that someday, the book fairy will come down and wave his/her magic wand at me! All silliness aside, reading about reading always gets me excited!<br />I have no idea where she came up with all of those titles, she must have done tons of researching, because there are over 3000 titles in this book alone!<br />I loved the little pages full of advice and ideas... example: Your Job: Connect children with books. Basically, if they want to be an accountant, read: Alexander, who used to be rich last Sunday. If they want to be in hotel management, read Rabbit Inn.<br />Her chapters range for ages from infants to teenagers, stopping at interesting subjects in between! Books in the bath, alphabet and counting books, wordless books, unbirthday stories, civil war, slavery, Africa, Asia, the list goes on and on!<br />Also, there are lots of little advice columns for those that need help. She responds, Dear gentle reader...<br />I wish there was a book around when I was younger so I could have a greater access to all of these titles! Reading to children is the most important thing we can do for them because it spells out love and caring! I have to buy it!	2003-12-21

First of all, I really enjoyed Shopgirl, but it ended too quickly. I did have the same result with The Pleasure of my Company, but it was still an enjoyable ride.<br />There are some people who do not find this book funny, and I guess that's understandable. Some people would not find someone with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder humorous. But, since some people have a little of it in us (making sure that nothing touches electrical outlets, not stepping on cracks, etc) there is a subtlety of humor that gets to you. It does feel, very obviously, Steve Martin but there are not tons of laugh out loud moments. There are chuckles, and it was fun to read, starting at the beginning, where the main character thinks that Mensa had a clerical error in his IQ score, when leaving the 1 off of the 90. This is obviously someone who thinks a bit much of himself.<br />Daniel Cambridge lives in Santa Monica, right across from the beach. He would probably enjoy going there, if he was able to step off of the 8 inch curbs. Instead, he makes treks to Rite Aid, to pick up his prescriptions and stare at the pharmacist Zandy, while he enters an essay contest of why he is average, sponsored by Tepperton's Frozen Apple Pies. \\"I am average because... I stand on the seashore here in Santa Monica and let the Pacific Ocean touch my toes, and I know I am at the most western edge of our nation, and that I am a descendant of the settlers who came to California as pioneers. And is not every American a pioneer?\\" he writes.<br />He doesn't do MUCH else except get visits from the student therapist Clarissa, staring at Elizabeth the realtor across the street, and slipping Quaalude into drinks for his upstairs neighbor, because, he believes that, when she gets drugged, her relationship with her boyfriend is better. Explain that logic.<br />When I read the paragraph about his walking by Elizabeth the realtor, trying to impress her, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.<br />\\"When I hit the street, I encountered a problem. I had forgotten to wear sunglasses. So, as I walked by her, facing west into the sun, while I may have been an aloof figure, I was an aloof figure who squinted. One half of my face was shut like a salted snail, while the other half was held open in attempt to see. ...Elizabeth looked over (I intentionally scuffled my foot, an impetuous betrayal of my own plan to let her notice me on her own), I was half puckered and probably dangerous-looking.\\"<br />To me, this man seemed a very strange individual, and these are the best people to read about, because there was unpredictability at every turn.ed a problem.

This is a must for those who can appreciate intelligent characters and plot schemes.<br />We meet Alice Thrift, who is an intern at a hospital in Boston. She eventually wants to work with the underpriviledged doing  surgery on those in 3rd world nations, correcting birth defects, burns, and such. She is not like any character I have read about in the chick lit genre. She is very intelligent, but has a low emotional IQ. She can be funny without knowing it and her mother thinks that she has Aspergers Syndrome (a mild form of autism) because she is not very social and doesn't make eye contact very often.<br />She meets Ray Russo, a character who is talked out of Rhinoplasty, by accident. It's not that she didn't think he should have the surgery, it is because she was anti-plastic surgery.. she was waiting to perform surgeries for more noble purposes.<br />He seems taken with her and asks her out. She accepts, but probably doesn't know why. He is not good looking, but he is big on flattery and can be charming. He also has some habits such as calling her &quot;doc&quot; every chance he gets, and constantly bringing up the fact that she is a doctor in mixed company. You would think that he is very proud of that fact.<br />Their strange courtship aside, Alice comes in contact with other interesting people: her roommate Leo and his midwife girlfriend Meredith, her new neighbor Sylvie, who's &quot;hair was spiky, the ends the color of Cheddar Cheese and the roots dark in a fashion I knew was deliberate.&quot; She is also an intern at the same hospital, strangely enough, and they become fast friends. Her only friend besides, Leo, in fact. Sylvie helps her through her strange relationship with Ray, the problems that come about later.<br />The main point is: Ray: is he to be trusted? Can anyone really trust a fudge salesman? Only you can ever know for sure by reading this book, but he has some sketchy habits that would make a normal person doubt him. Is Alice a normal person? Not exactly. Therefore, she is the perfect candidate for the Ray Russo relationship. Craziness ensues!<br />The characters are real as if Elinor Lipman (the author) went through this experience herself. Highly enjoyable.n? Not exactly.

Books	5	13	13	N	N	Perfect for new elementary teachers!	Since I am somewhat new to the teaching profession, I was looking for all of the resources I could get!! I came across this book, and I really like the way that it's set up. It is simply written, and broken up into organized bullets in each section!<br />There are chapters containing subjects such as: Countdown to the first day, the first day, the first month, the first year, the end of school. Within those sections, you have things like classroom procedures and rules, student helpers, lesson plans, substitutes, working with parents, learning centers, assessment, and everything else that you could imagine!<br />I loved the &quot;helpers&quot; on the sides of the pages! Seymour Books gives you resources for more reading!<br />Sir Chalott gives you webpages!<br />Uneeda Halt comes around to make sure that you do the most important things first!<br />Pierre Tutor directs you to the person you need to talk to when it comes to site-specific info, mentoring, and peer coaching!<br />Mia First encourages you to take time for yourself and to relax!!<br />At the very end, there are reproducible pages for behavior charts, progress reports, behavior bucks, and agenda chart icons! (reading together, art, music, library, drama, ABC's, etc) There are also helper chart icons so you can copy and laminate for class jobs! I have always loved scholastic books and I highly recommend this one for new classroom teachers grades K-4!<br />Diane (kindergarten teacher)	2003-10-06

I was skeptical about trying out this book, because I have seen Keyes's books before and they all seemed too long, and not for me. Maybe the cover just attracted me (Yes, I judged the book by it's cover) and I thought that the title was interesting. I was not disappointed!<br />The book generally deals with three separate women, and their circle of friends. The first is Lisa, she works on a womans magazine in England, but she ends up getting sent to Dublin to start up a new women's magazine, and doesn't have any choice in the matter. She is less than thrilled, but picks up anyway, leaves her husband (which she had problems with anyway) and tries to make a new life for herself in Ireland. Being bitter and stubborn the whole way.<br />Also getting a job at this same magazine, but with a much better attitute, is Ashling, who is really excited for this opportunity. Apparently, magazine jobs were rare in Ireland, so it was said.<br />Clodagh is Ashling's very best friend and she is saddled with two kids and a husband. Apparently devastatingly beautiful and feeling neglected and needing something different, she also tries to get a job with no experience to speak of. She has the perfect life, in Ashling's eyes, also because Clodagh stole this man away from her  and married him herself.<br />There are many many other minor characters in this novel, some needed, some not. Ted, Ashling's up and coming comic friend who introduces her to her self-centered new boyfriend, Marcus Valentine, who is also an up and coming comic who writes Bellez-moi and his phone number and napkins and gives them to unsuspecting girls. Jack Devine is the rumpled yet handsome boss of Lisa and Ashling, and both of them have a crush on him. Lisa is stylish and beautiful, Ashling is plain, but down to earth. They still have competition with the lovely, exotic girlfriend Mai, who is constantly screaming back and forth in Jack's office, which is what keeps them together. There is also the homeless man Boo, who becomes fast friends with Ashling, and helps with her downward spiral of depression like her mom, as she wonders, why is life so unfair?<br />But, I'm getting ahead of myself, and my review is becoming as long as the book! Which leads me to the little problem of 426 pages. I am not saying that it was not interesting, it was, but half way through I started to realize how long this was taking me to finish, and the awareness of it slowed me down a bit. I will also mention again that there are many characters to get to know, but... for what it's worth, Keyes does an excellent job of making you remember them, and connect them to each other. To put together so many personalities that are so different is the genius in this book. I really enjoyed it. I may even try her books again (even though they are all kind of long) :)oo, who becomes fast friends with Ashling, and helps with her downward spiral of depression like her mom, as she wonders, why is life so unfair? <br />But, I'm getting ahead of myself, and my review is becoming as long as the book!

Jane Green usually writes about single girls living their lives, not married women wanting babies, but I knew that she wouldn't do me wrong!<br />There are three parts to this book: simply, Julia, Maeve, and Sam. These women couldn't be more different! Julia, has a live-in boyfriend and wants a baby with him, because she wants to patch up their relationship unknowingly. Maeve, on the other hand, couldn't be farther away from wanting that commitment, but she ends up pregnant instead! Sam, Julia's best friend, has the husband and baby, and looks perfect from the outside, but the inside story is way different.<br />This author shows that she knows what it's like to have the baby: postpardum depression, weight gain, feeling like you have lost your own life BB (before baby) and your own identity! She also knows that women can have a life as well as a family! Don't be put off by the 400 something pages, I did not get bored once!<br />Also, I was afraid that once I finished with the womans &quot;story,&quot; that we would never see them again in the book, never know how everything turned out. I was wrong! Apparently, these three women are all interconnected, and that was great how she wove them all together!<br />Highly recommended!	2003-07-29

She takes the mundane things in life, the normalcy, and she changes it around, to help us remember what we saw once, as well.<br />In this new book, Say When, it opens with a wife and husband, Griffin and Ellen, where the husband has found out that his wife is in love with someone else, and she wants to leave him. To me, this is news enough, because I always feel as though Im reading about the husband doing this to the wife. Needless to say, Griffin is not happy with the separation. He seems to be a character who is happier when married.<br />The twist on it is, is that no one wants to leave the house. The one thing that they seem to have in common, is the great love they have for their eight year old daughter, Zoe. From then on, they try to reside in the same household peacefully, but, instead, they have much anger and resentment toward one another. I noticed that Griffin, like many others in relationships, thought that everyone was happy and satisfied. Instead, he never realized how unhappily married she had become. She used a great metaphor, &quot;I think our marriage was like a house we stopped using. I mean, you know, you move in, and there are all these terrific rooms, .... and you end up being in the same two rooms all the time... We got swallowed up by a domestic routine that didn't leave room for us as the individuals we are.&quot;<br />I think the good thing about Griffin, was that he found satisfaction within himself, so that, if she ever did come back, he would know that he was being with her for the right reasons, not because he didn't want to be alone.<br />There is a lot of deconstruction of people and what keeps them togther and pulls them apart. There are a lot of memories and nostalgia so you get to know who you are reading about, wonderful descriptions of people so you feel you can see them, and it was a very quick read. Highly recommended.	2003-07-15

This book inspired me to make my own &quot;happy list&quot; once upon a time!! It is basically 612 pages of things that make the author happy. You might say, &quot;how boring!&quot; But, it's not! She received a PHD in Linguistics and that's quite obvious, because not many people could pull this off! I used to use this as a mood book, where I would underline things that made me happy. It would always take away my bad mood, because it would remind me that there is no reason to focus on the bad when there are so many little things in life to remember!<br />Some examples:<br />a chance to sleep in<br />naming your baby<br />buying fresh flowers<br />the pleasure of water<br />smelling corncob-smoked bacon sizzling, maple-scented muffins, and pancakes off the griddle<br />hair towels<br />going to three museums in a row<br />roller skating around the block<br />See what I mean? A lot of the things on the list have to do with food, really good, home cookin', so beware if you read it while hungry!! It reminds you of all the tiny, great things in the world!

In the past, I have explained that I hate predictibility and stories that seem non-realistic. Well, in this book, only a couple of parts made me say, \\"Yeah, right!\\" The rest made me say, \\"OH YEEAHH!\\"<br />I don't know if it was the sexy Nick character, or Libby, the main character, or her irritating mom. I can't pinpoint it. It was extremely enjoyable.<br />Libby is a brit chick who works in PR (Thank goodness it didn't focus too much on her job, like some other chick books, I would have been very bored) It had just the right amount. She was trying to make a morning news woman famous, all the while, charging up her love life.<br />She meets Nick. No money, but a lot of charm! He's an aspiring writer, and he was \\"supposed\\" to be a fling. He's fun, good in bed, and if he was real, I would even try to grab him! She tries to keep it casual, but he sees through her, and slinks out of the picture. In comes Ed. Yawn, is all I can say, and that's how he is supposed to be. He's apparently famous in the financial world, and rich as Aaron Spelling, but he never has time for a social life, or to date for that matter. He falls head over heels for Libby. Now, she must decide. Should she be with the predictable, terrible in the sack, but loyal and in love Ed? Or, should she be with the fun-loving, wonderful, but broke Nick? Read to find out!<br />Unfortunately, yes, this character places a little too much emphasis on the \\"money\\" bit, and living a rich life, but I can forgive it! I just felt that it was so well written (especially the bedroom scenes) and even with 357 pages, I was never bored!<br />Highly recommended!	2003-05-13

I thought that this book would be sort of fun, or maybe well written! I was wrong! Formulaic, of course! Jane is an associate editor at a publishing house! (Can writers of chick lit ever work anywhere else?) She needs a boyfriend, so she can take him to her perfect cousin's wedding and please her aunt! She goes through some not so interesting blind dates, finds some possible love, loses it, and ... ta-dah! The end proves that the formula is always followed!<br />I think what bothered me a lot is the fact that the author used actor/actress names to describe someone. What ever happened to good, old-fashioned writing? Where you use your &quot;talent&quot; and &quot;show, not tell?&quot; Natasha looks like Nicole Kidman, a guy she dated looked like Greg, from Dharma and Greg, and she danced with a guy that looked like someone from Northern Exposure! Please!! Don't make it so dated, that people can only understand who these celebrities are in the years 2000-2005 or whatever!! Cheesy!<br />At the beginning, it was interesting, somewhat entertaining, and funny in parts, but the longer I read those almost 300 pages, I tried to hurry up to the inevitable end! I normally like being right, but I hate it in these situations! Save your money, read Milkrun instead. A much better Red Dress Ink book)	2003-05-02

Even though this book wasn't very realistic, I was still going to give it a chance. The premise sounded interesting: A woman goes to a \\"life enhancement\\" doctor because she finds fault with her husband and wants to \\"enhance\\" him. That seems to be the age old question: \\"How do you change a man?\\" Well, for Elizabeth Baskin, that proved to be easy, with the doctors herbs from South America!--or something to that effect. She drops it into his orange juice every morning, and tah-dah! He is a changed person! He has become more attentive, more loving, more amorous! He has become so perfect, in fact, that he wants to make her perfect as well, nitpicking every thing she does, much like SHE DID before she slipped him the drugs!!!<br />Unfortunately, throughout the book, it went up and down, like a rollercoaster. She touched on something interesting, then it went back to the ---I think someone else's review explained it perfectly--- Lucy and Ethel routine! Elizabeth, and her friend Clover, try to break into the doctors office, end up in jail, and make friends with a prisoner named \\"Cherry.\\" After that, it became a little bit too predictable for me. There were some extra added subplots (Chris Eckersly, the Cherry stuff, hotel manager holding her captive) that just wasn't needed.) I did like the detailed description of her job, reviewing hotels. That was very interesting.<br />Usually, I need a little more depth when I read novels (not entirely true, because I like chick lit) but if there is no depth, it should at least be fun. It just wasn't too fun, or funny for me. Maybe good for some, but not good enough for me.	2003-03-16

I keep reading reviews that say these authors were whining and complaining. I couldn't find any of that. What I found were very diverse stories that kept me interested (almost)until the end! It was very interesting to read about these women with very different lives! Even though I don't agree with some of their lifestyles, I found them very honest and a quick read. I especially liked these stories:<br />Getting the Milk for Free--about a woman (like me) who has never felt that &quot;need&quot; for marriage, like so many others. She decided that &quot;living together&quot; was good enough.<br />Crossing to Safety -- about a woman who decided that she got along better with her boyfriend and they enjoyed each others company more--when they were living in different states.<br />Papa Don't Preach-- she had an affair with a married man and decided to keep the baby.<br />Why I won't marry-- a beautiful story about a woman who has a &quot;common law&quot; husband and the daughter they have, the lives they share.<br />Houseguest Hell--this is probably one of my favorites-- by Chitra Divakaruni... the clashing of Eastern and Western lifestyles--or why she is a slave to her houseguests.<br />My Marriage. My Affairs-- how a woman and her husband attempted an &quot;open marriage,&quot; and how she really felt about it.<br />Anyway, not these stories are for everyone. I felt connected with them, because they let you into their lives. Maybe you won't live the kind of lives they do, but maybe you don't want to. A very good book.<br />Warning: my interest dropped a little toward the end. Other than that, it was great!	2003-03-07

People who have jumped over BIG hurdles just to help other people.<br />We have to learn to give and receive love, without wondering what they \\"want from us.\\" Stop being so suspicious. One little thing does make a difference. Maybe not to the world, but to yourself, or someone else. Last week, there was a guy that worked at a radio station who was staying in this little tarp-covered contraption 30 feet above the ground until he received 2000 toys to donate to Toys for Tots or until 100 or so hours had passed. When I came to donate, he said, \\"It feels warm in there.\\" I just had read some of the book that day, and when I made cookies for my school's workroom, I put some aside and delivered some warm cookies to him. When the security guard called him over, he had this little smirk on his face, like I was some kind of secret admirer, or stalker. That part bothered me. It's like no one can do something nice, just to be nice!! So anyway, I don't know what happened after that or what, but just one thing we do for someone else.. well.. doesn't that make us (and them) feel good?<br />She talks about a woman who stayed in a redwood tree and lived there two years so they wouldn't be cut down, a man who paints huge murals on every wall he can find, a woman who adopted 28 children (not Mia Farrow) and 27 of them have special needs. These are people that we don't know about, because we worship celebrities in movies or on TV. People that are famous just because their faces are bodies are familiar or beautiful to us. I am just as guilty and can be \\"star-struck\\" at times. We need to remind ourselves that what we give is what matters, not what we get. We learned this when we were little around the time of exchanging Christmas presents.<br />Pam Grout mentions that \\"last year, we spent 40 billion dollars on weight loss products, 98 percent of which did absolutely no good. With that 40 billion, we could give a million dollars a day to a worthwhile cause for the next 85 years. Maybe instead of looking for the next big diet, we should ask: What is the one thing that makes me want to get up on the table and dance? What do I ache for? How can I inject surprise, fun, and outrageousness into this day?\\" Losing weight gives you a temporary feeling of happiness, but it doesn't last, cause it's not as important as many other things in the world. SUV's, big houses, and lots of money is also NOT AS IMPORTANT. I think we need to be reminded daily of that. Our children, other people, humanity, those things are important, but we spent \\"10 minutes a day talking to our kids.\\"<br />This book is wonderful. Everyone should read it, then it wouldn't just be \\"one person making a difference.\\" It would be everyone working at it. I want to live big. Don't you?nd can be \\"star-struck\\" at times.

US	49785275	R2EX4OP8HDYL0T	0373250134	559572782	Slightly Single (Red Dress Ink paperback}	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Doesn't the author get how sad this is?	First of all, I'd like to mention that I normally love the \\"chick lit\\" genre. I think a lot of us do. I don't expect it to be deep or anything; mostly light and fun. But, when I started this book, after about 10 pages, I realized: \\"I don't have to finish it! I know exactly how it's going to end!\\" But, I did finish it. I was hoping it would turn around and prove me wrong.<br />So, it starts out with Tracey. The insecure, slightly overweight woman who is obsessed with her boyfriend for half of the book and obsessed with her weight for the other half. Her boyfriend is an actor who leaves to do summer stock, in another part of New York. They have been together three years, but strangely enough, he has never really treated her right, but she has always stayed with him. She is constantly fretting over girls that he knows who have \\"Pamela Anderson bodies and Catherine Zeta Jones faces.\\" She thinks that if she loses weight, gets rid of clutter, makes some money, and reads classics, her boyfriend Will, will see how wonderful she is, after having reinvented herself.<br />Enter Buckley. The boy next door, handsome, but not too handsome sweetheart of a guy. She met him at her friend Raphael's party and assumes he's gay, as does Raphael, because he wants Buckley. She continues to think he's gay, until they go on a pseudo-date, and Buckley kisses her. She exclaims, \\"OH! We are on a date???\\" Hello, Tracey!! When the character was introduced even I saw that he would like you, because things like this happen in books like this. So, that was pretty cheesy. He stays her friend, through everything and is supportive and wonderful.<br />I just dislike this book. I wish the main character was stronger and not pathetic. She says, \\"I'd gladly swap everything between my ribs and clavicle for a flat chest if it came with the ten year old boy body I so covet.\\" Everything seems to be about appearances. Even her boyfriend Will looks like a cross between \\"Ben and Noel on Felicity.\\" PLEASE!!!<br />The saddest part is when she starts to lose weight, then feels sorry for her sister for being overweight, and her family for being so tacky. \\"Don't overdo it,\\" my sister warns, sounding just like my mother. I look at my sister, standing there in her sweatpants and sweatshirt that do little to conceal her belly and hips and thighs, and I feel sorry for her.<br />Basically, she lives on 1,000 calories a day, she skips breakfast and lunch to fit into some little dress, and is surprised when her boyfriend still doesn't want her. Maybe because he sees her like she sees herself: Not good enough for him and concentrating on things that aren't as important as she thinks they are. Like her self obsessed appearance.<br />I did give one extra star because the author is able to grasp the pain of break-ups, and you actually start to feel sorry for the character, at least for a little while./>The saddest part is when she starts to lose weight, then feels sorry for her sister for being overweight, and her family for being so tacky. \\"Don't overdo it,\\" my sister warns, sounding just like my mother.

In the past, I have owned my fair share of spanish guidebooks. Normally, I buy books that have exercises in them, as a way to practice the spanish language, not just look up a word here or there. But, this book would be good for a student in a class, or someone trying to learn on their own.<br />Not only does it have many examples of many ways to translate certain words, (ie, to go out: salir &quot;I'm going out to dinner.&quot; &quot;Voy a salir a cenar.&quot; then afterwards, it says: to go off: dispararse &quot;The pistol went off accidentally.&quot; &quot;La pistola se disparo' accidentalmente.&quot;) it also has certain idioms as well.

I started the book last night and finished it this morning. It was a very easy read in the way that it flowed, but there were some things that I just didn't get. That doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy it.<br />It starts out where Rosemary wakes up from a 27 1/2 year long coma and wonders what has happened to her (then) 6 year old Andy/Adrian. It turns out that he is the most loved, charismatic man in the world, bringing people together under one faith, where everyone is equal. Apparently, he is able to temporarily get rid of his tiger eyes and the horn-buds with black magic.<br />Andy, the leader of GC (God's Children) wants to unite the world with a candle lighting on New Years Eve, 2000. \\"Everyone, everywhere, all of civilized humanity, lighting sky-blue-and-yellow GC candles, in the year 2000's very first minute, Greenwich Mean Time!\\"<br />Now, people have complained that Rosemary's naivete was shocking and a little too much, but really now, wasn't she that way through Rosemary's Baby as well? She would start to get an idea in her head that would save herself, and someone would tell her a lie, then she would believe it! She has always been that way, so it's no surprise that her son and everyone else would tell her lies that she would eventually believe, because she wanted to believe that Andy had been more human than devil's spawn.<br />Some of the parts are a little predictable. I started to realize what was going to happen with the candles even when Rosemary had someone check them out. To be honest, i really didn't understand the incestuous nature of Andy and Rosemary.. and how it bothered her at first, but she didn't give it much thought when he kept persisting.<br />The ending can be viewed in one of two ways: both seen in the many reviews I read by the customers: 1) a copout or 2) a genius ending that one has to think about, and not just let the printed word entertain you. SPOILER: if it really had ended as just a dream, then how do you explain the line spoken by Hutch: \\"Oh, before I forget, Roast Mules? Exactly three minutes and twelve seconds by the clock.\\" Some might say deja-vu, but I'm sure that it is something more.<br />Also, this isn't really a spoiler since we never know what happens to him.. many people seem to wonder about Guy. Isn't it possible that he is dead? The reason why I say this, is because Rosemary wakes up when the last member of the cult dies, and he joined the cult back in the 60's. Maybe they lied to him as well, promising him good parts...so he did not succeed in his acting ventures and killed himself?<br />I guess we are on our own to figure it out.poken by Hutch: \\"Oh, before I forget, Roast Mules?

I have tried to read them for years and I can't get into them. The stories never seem to sum up a point, it feels like as soon as I start getting into it, it ends! The only reason I tried this one is because I have read a few of her books and loved them. I read this book in two days! I had to keep coming back to it!  Some of my favorites:<br /><br />The first story \\"Ordinary Life: a Love Story\\" gets you right off the bat because the main character locks herself in the bathroom for a week! It's as almost if everyday life is too loud sometimes and the only way you can think is to shut yourself out from it for a while. A seventy-nine year old woman does this and her husband thinks that she has gone crazy. She just sits back, relaxes, and thinks about her life.. her marriage, her children, her sister that died of breast cancer. Memories plague her and she gets the relaxation she needs.<br />The third story in this collection is called \\"Things We Used to Believe\\" This is about a women Martha, who spends her time with a male best friend. \\"She thinks sometimes that she would like to marry him, but she is already severely married.\\" This story got me.. how many times have I been with someone, wondering what it would be like to be with someone else, someone you are close to, but never attempted a relationship. (though I am not married) One of my favorite lines: \\"They get up, and she sees that his sneakers are huge. She understands that there is much about him that is unfamiliar to her. They start walking toward the lake. They walk to keep from the bedroom, where things would only get more difficult.\\"<br />\\"Take this Quiz\\" is the sixth story about a husband and wife who have been together for a while, and the wife wants her husband to take a quiz in a magazine asking, \\"How Happy are you?\\" I once attempted something like this by trying to make my ex-boyfriend read \\"Men are From Mars, Women are from Venus.\\" It didn't work. SPOILER: The most beautiful lines, metaphor in this story, and maybe the whole book in my opinion, was the way she described what happened to them after she was pushing about the quiz. \\"She is remembering the time she was nine and took apart a jewelry box she loved, to see what made the ballerina turn around. Though she paid careful attention to each step, when she tried to reassemble it, it didn't work the way it had before. No one else could fix it, either.The ballerina stayed in place, permanently turned away, oblivious to the music she had danced to before.\\"<br />There are so many beautiful stories in this book. It's as if Elizabeth Berg takes the small, yet still important things about everyday life and creates descriptions so pure and beautiful, they remind you of the things you miss everyday when you are in such a hurry. Read this book.most beautiful lines, metaphor in this story, and maybe the whole book in my opinion, was the way she described what happened to them after she was pushing about the quiz. \\"She is remembering the time she was nine and took apart a jewelry box she loved, to see what made the ballerina turn around.

I don't know much about quantum physics (or science in general), Ayurveda, or biological aging, but I do know that there are many older people who have the energy and attitute of those 20 years younger. Maybe it has to do with diet, exercise, and vitamins. Maybe it does have to do with &quot;letting things go.&quot; I know that it is possible to break your body down by having bad attitudes about life and not taking care of yourself in general. I have worked with a lot of older women who laugh at me when I tell them that I will be a strong older woman who is not only going to talk about my aches and pains all of the time. I agree that &quot;what you see, you become.&quot; I also believe that you can look and feel younger by getting lots of sleep, using sunscreen, exercising, deep breathing, eliminating toxins, being flexible (physically and emotionally) loving, and expanding your mind and perceptions. That is the whole point of this book. I know that many people seem to disagree about this book, but my grandmother lived to a healthy 91 years old because she continued to do things she always did. She swam till she was in her 80's and painted until her last year of life. I hope that I keep a good attitude throughout life to be as healthy and she was, and this book had a lot of good ideas and recipes!	2001-12-19

It was straightforward, interesting, fun, breezed right through it. I love books about urban legends anyway, but I also enjoy how they add history, Like &quot;Did Shakespeare write Shakespeare?&quot; and &quot;Did Catherine the Great really do it with a horse?&quot;<br />Also, it has a lot of emails that are circulated, since email is a big part of our lives nowadays which makes sense about how they can get passed from person to person so quickly.<br />I like the sidenotes that have &quot;don't believe it&quot; (you get the background on stories that are too weird to be true)  or &quot;fable facts&quot; (trivia related to the legends) also &quot;strange but true&quot; (extended anecdotes, case histories, or other tidbits)  and &quot;legend lingo&quot; explains the more difficult vocabulary words. There is even a chapter on what an urban legend is, and how to spot one. For example, is the story demonstrably false? Has the story appeared in multiple versions? Does the story carry an important lesson or warning? I remember being scared many times during my childhood because i thought the star tattoos were laced or if i went to the movies, i would be stuck with an HIV infected needle. It's great to put my fears to rest, but still entertaining!!!	2001-12-19

I am very interested in books written for teenagers. Maybe because there weren't as many life skills guides when i was a teenager ten years ago. I feel that they can be very helpful, and talk about things that can assist teenagers and adults alike.<br />I don't have a problem with those that have strong religious beliefs, but when it shapes the way a book is written, it carries that undertone. For example, when Marshall Brian talks about sex, he explains that it is not an option for teenagers. That is a very unrealistic view. Even if he doesn't believe its a good idea for teenagers, express that, then follow it up with... &quot;if you decide to have sex, this is how to be safe.&quot; Whether or not he thinks they should, it will happen, and the author shouldn't be in denial about it. Another thing is, he acts as if marriage and children is the end all, be all. The point is, he only discusses one path for teenagers to follow. He never discusses gay teenagers, and they do exist, whether he wants to admit to it or not. Some people are not interested in marriage or children, and in this day and age, a lot of people stay single when they are older.<br />It's great how he breaks down the money situation, like how much money you need to move out and start on your own, and how to develop your talents and skills, so it can help you in the job situation later. However, sometimes, it seems that he leans toward money being everything, or the most important thing, which isn't true. There is a lot more to life than being successful in a job and making money. He never mentions having fun, building self esteem, enjoying your time being young. It's like he is presenting a life that looks good &quot;on paper,&quot; rather than what is good for the individual.<br />He also talks down to the teenagers quite a bit, saying things like: &quot;As a teenager, you are fairly naive about the real world,&quot; and &quot;most teenagers also life in a protected dream land created by their parents.&quot; Maybe that's true for some teenagers, but I feel that in the new millenium, teenagers are more aware about what is going on arounnd them.<br />He is the president of a software development firm and taught computer science. He seems to make some good points and it is easy to understand. But, in the future, I think that he is better off writing books having to do with what he is best at. Not everyone can write books for teenagers.

US	49785275	R1VPIA5BR27Y44	0385484003	556397817	Bitch	Books	3	64	72	N	N	There are things I liked about it and others I didn't...	I did not like:<br />*that the book did not follow any sort of train of thought. Even though it was broken up into five or six essays, she would go from one person to the next so quickly, you don't even know she was talking about a different person. I skipped most of the stuff on Delilah, the character showed up on occasion throughout 2-3 of the essays, and sometimes stayed for pages. I wasn't interested in it, and the author probably should have just written a whole essay on her. Apparently, this book was written on some kind of speed, which makes sense, but couldn't it have been cut down a little? Or, at least, molded into something readable? Maybe its supposed to fit with the running theme: &quot;Bad girls: young, beautiful, and on drugs.&quot; Which leads me to the next thought...<br />*What is her obsession with beauty? It seems like every woman she mentions is somehow tragically beautiful.. and these are the women who are bi#$%#s, the &quot;difficult&quot; women... how she says: &quot;I am still pretty. I still have time to work out my marital status.&quot; &lt;---What is that about? As if the only people who are married are good looking? Since when is marriage about &quot;looks&quot; anyway? or she also says..&quot;even worse, it seems inevitable that there will come a time when I won't look good, when men will stop flirting with me, when this freedom sh#$ will start to feel more like free-falling. Will I know? Will I become pathetic?&quot; No, you will just have to win people over by personality for a change! I just don't understand the superficial attitude for someone who is supposed to be a feminist. I have known women who are not great beauties, but everywhere they go, men fall in love with them. Once again, love is not about outside beauty. Unless, she is worried that at 50, she won't be able to have lots of one night stands, and men falling at her feet. This is probably true.<br />*Her opinions didn't even follow anything concrete. It seemed that at one moment she believed wholeheartedly in something, and then turned around and said.. oh wait, i forgot about that. nevermind, i believe this instead. Unfortunately, i can't come up with an example, because I would have to plow through this monstrous book for it. At least, she broke it into paragraphs.<br />What I did like about the book:<br />* the way she uses examples of movies, books, stories, and songs in her essays. Most of the movies are familiar to me, Fatal Attraction, Foxfire... then she mentions others that maybe some people wouldn't know, but should watch.. like Welcome to the Dollhouse or if Lucy fell. Many books that I own, have references or what the author has as a bibliography... My favorite author SARK recommends books on every chapter, sometimes music or web pages. It's just like a chain where you are exposed to things you would never have been before you read this book. Unfortunately, in Wurtzel's bibliography, i think she fails to mention the movies.<br />* I liked the essay, &quot;Used to love her but I had to kill her.&quot; This touches on a lot of things having do to with O.J., and his late ex-wife Nicole. I never really followed the trial, but I do agree with the author, that he did it. It's funny too, because she doesn't use the word &quot;allegedly&quot; anywhere in the chapter. It's written like: when he killed her.... or he probably killed her because. It's as if she believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he committed the crime, and she is not going to believe otherwise no matter what you say...<br />*which leads into this: the honesty of the book gets me. I would be afraid to let go of myself too much into a book. She has very strong opinions. Not only that, but she talks about her life, how she feels about herself, what she has done. One of my favorite paragraphs is where she talks about how she is not married and why she is not.. the reason is because there are things she &quot;needed to do.&quot; the start of this paragraph is... &quot;I needed to spend a week in Florence by myself, to check into the Excelsior Hotel and eat breakfast and dinner in bed with a view of the Arno, watching soccer on Italian television and be amazingly bored, I needed to walk the streets of this most romantic and recherche of cities all alone...&quot; I loved that. It goes on for about two pages but I didn't mind. You get a peek into her life and all of the adventures she has had. For me, I yearned for those experiences to be mine. I want to go back to Europe, this time all by myself, and see things I didn't get to see the first time because I was going to pubs and hanging out with friends.<br />To sum up, it is a whale of a book, but if you have the patience to go through it, you should. She is very intelligent and has a lot of insight on things that I had never thought to analyze. If it is confusing or boring, skip it. That's what I did. There are just little gems scattered throughout. You just have to look for them sometimes.&quot;I needed to spend a week in Florence by myself, to check into the Excelsior Hotel and eat breakfast and dinner in bed with a view of the Arno, watching soccer on Italian television and be amazingly bored, I needed to walk the streets of this most romantic and recherche of cities all alone...&quot; I loved that.

US	49785275	R2UN1R9Z0FRWM	0689821867	738359886	Just Ella	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Brought a realistic view to a cheesy fairy tale...	It took me a night and a morning to read this book and I thought it was very clever and original. Now, I'm not saying I didn't grow up with the fairy tales about Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and happily ever after, (I enjoyed them as well) but maybe it's the fact that Im a little bit older and get tired of happily ever after (cause it doesn't exist) is what made me like this book.<br /> I disagree with a lot of the reviews. One of them talks about how Ella is not a real character because she disagrees with how things go in the castle. It is quite possible that there were people many many years ago who had more modern views about how the world and its people should behave. (eg. H.G. Wells believed in equal rights for women in the late 1800's, early 1900's) Just because you are raised in a certain era, does not have to mean that you agree with what goes on in that era. The world is full of different opinions and the fact that Ella is more &quot;liberal,&quot; is what makes her interesting. I'm sure that there were plenty of unhappy people in the &quot;olden days&quot; because they were oppressed. (Especially where women were concerned.) Another thing is that, nowhere in the book does it say the date, or when this takes place, its sort of an ageless tale. This was a good idea because it gives the author more leeway on language use and so on.<br />I thought that it was the perfect book for todays young adults, because they so often believe that you will meet a perfect guy, fall in love, get married, and live happily ever after. Disney taught us this, and so did Barbie's. I even believed it at one point. But, this book is for a young woman with more up-to-date views on life and love, not for someone looking for a happy ending fairy tale. (Even though I thought that the ending was perfect.)	2001-09-17

Now, at a youthful 26, it was only a year ago that I started to accept that I was going to \\"grow up.\\" When I was thirteen, this was a bad thing.<br />Like all of Veronique Viennes books, she shows you the good side of things that are seen by society as bad. (getting older, imperfection, doing nothing.) I have finally learned that getting older is great! It does get harder of course because there are so many more decisions to make, but I wouldn't trade that for wisdom, intelligence, and the fact that I am the one who gets to make those decisions!<br />The pictures in this book were taken by her daughter, Jeanne Lipsy, a photographer and camera assistant in her own right. They are black and white in style with a brown tint that brings an old fashioned look to it.<br />I think her next title should be \\"the art of eating ice cream while laying in bed and reading books and watching movies.\\" :)<br />We need to teach young women that \\"old\\" and \\"young\\" are just attitudes, not numbers! Read this book!	2001-09-12

Whenever I like a book, i try to read it as much as possible... at home, waiting for an appointment, in traffic. :) This is one of those books. It was so REAL. I don't know if being a prositute is close to what this character went through, but it was mostly about her, and not what she did for a living.<br /> Bennington was a strange, imperfect, hilarious character that i don't think you have to &quot;like,&quot; to enjoy reading about. She took on many jobs as an escort, had a serious commitment problem, tried to raise all of this money to go to NYU, only deciding to quit it not much later. She also made a bad choice with her boyfriend, Adam, who treated her terribly. Of course she would try to do everything he said only to have him find fault with that as well. Obviously this is not a woman I would want to hang out with because she has some serious problems, but seeing her from afar, you can't help but feel sorry for her and be intrigued about what makes her tick.<br />What I liked best about the book was the style in which it was written. She made observations about people that stick with you or make you laugh out loud, like &quot;she had an unfortunate Pippi Longstocking appearance&quot;, or &quot;I was friends with a girl in my building who was emotionally disturbed. She could recite Alice in Wonderland from beginning to end without stopping. Sometimes she would just scream for hours, going up and down in the elevator. I liked her a lot.&quot; Its obviously a book I should read more slowly next time, because I'm sure I missed a lot.<br />I could have done without the Vivian and Lars characters, or at least leave them out of the second half of the book. Other than that, it's great!	2001-07-21

Like everyone else has said about her, she knows people. She can get inside and make a character so real, that you have to believe it. She was able to do that for me with the character, Myra. Unfortunately, some of the other characters I thought were a little bit weak. I'm very half and half on this book. There were times when i couldn't put it down.. and there were others when i couldn't put it down cause i just wanted to get on with it. I thought that some parts didn't work, like the robber--the (SPOILER---Don't look if you haven't read) the budding romance between Myra and Chip) and some of the DeWitt parts. I did cry though, when Myra was grappling with a decision that she had to make at the end, and I sat back, quiet.. just thinking about it when i was done. As a whole, it didn't totally work for me.. but, its just like the author to leave me with something, little bits and pieces that I loved about her book.	2001-07-08

I bought this book because I know that she is one of SARKs friends so i guess i expected her to write like SARK as well. It's a good start, I think that she has a lot of potential, especially with her art. I could just look through the book at the pictures and the collages, all of the color, and it sucks you in..<br />Some of the writing though.. its hard to understand. I wanted more coherance.. There were bits and pieces that i would have loved to read more about.. but most of it were fragmented and that disappointed me. I will read Brave on the rocks.. her next book that comes out in August, I just hope that its easier to see.<br />Overall though, she captured the feeling of being a &quot;girl&quot; and all of that problems and scary feelings that go along with it. I think you should see it just for the art alone.	2001-06-27

This book has everything you need to know about the Peace Corps! Wanting to join myself, I haven't been able to find a lot of updated books on the subject. There are a lot of fictionalized accounts, but this is the best book I could have found!<br />The author himself served in Camaroon a few years back and has first hand knowledge of what its like. He talks about everything I wanted to know, including: the application process, traveling after the two years are up, the different jobs that are offered, statistics on who serves, dating, whether or not there will be electricity, and other important things!!<br />The book has a different question on every page, so you can turn to the subject you need---gets right to the point!<br />I recommend this for anyone looking to go into the peace corps or anyone interested in seeing what its like... he describes it so clearly, you feel like you are there.	2001-06-14

I first read Material World: a Global family portrait. This one is similar, and has some of the same people in it, but this one focuses on the women in the family, and how she takes care of her family, what she thinks about, how she gets along in life in general.<br />There are some statistics about the country, things about how much money they make, the literacy rate, etc.. none of it boring. the book makes you feel like you are traveling around the world and meeting all of these people. The pictures are also beautiful.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in other cultures and the way that women live around the world.. i would love to find more books like this. It makes me thankful for how much I have and the opportunities in this country that are open to women!	2001-06-11

Not only are there a ton of them, but there is also a history behind them. Some reviewers have mentioned that they don't like them, but I think that's what makes it interesting! You find out where the story first circulated, or if some calls came into the police station about it!<br />i personally believe that some of them happened. How many times did i fall for that coke/pop rock story? I'm still scared to flash people who dont' have their lights on, even if its pitch black outside, and I was so ready to make cookies from that 250 dollar recipe from Neiman Marcus after I got it in an email!!!<br />I think this is a great book with a lot of information---so read it if you are obsessed with urban legends like I am!	2001-05-28

I finished this book today and most of the time, i couldn't put it down. Unlike the bigger, bulkier books with lots of history behind them, this one gets right to the point. I do like the ones with the history, and even though this book provides some information like different variations or when the story started, sometimes I wanted more.<br />There are a ton of legends in here though--and its very easy to read--its like hearing a good joke and you can't wait for the punchline. Even though some of them scared me--the poodle in the microwave (i can never read that one without cringing) and Bloody Mary (I still can't look into a mirror around midnight--cause then i will think of this story---you dont even have to do it at midnight, but for some reason, i always connect it to that!!)<br />Plus, there are fun ones, like the college ones I enjoyed since i just graduated--i also loved hearing how elvis is alive and paul is dead.<br />Quick and easy read... a &quot;no nonsense&quot; urban legends book! :)	2001-05-28

I am extremely intimidated by painting, so I took baby steps and bought this book. It comes with some beautiful watercolors that are rich and color--and a brush as well.<br />They start you off with painting some small pictures, even blobs if you are comfortable with it, and you will be amazed to see how much your lil paintings look like paintings instead of a piece of crap (which is what i expected---can i say crap?) anyway, they give you pages where you can &quot;play&quot; and you don't start color mixing and other frightening things until later.<br />Later on, you do landscapes and play around with some light and shadow. Its like the fisher price version of learning to paint!! Sometimes, my pictures blended in with their little pictures along the way, which made me happy. They just turn something very scary, into something a lil more easy.<br />If you run out of paints or brushes, or you want some more paper, there's a phone number in the back you can call to order some more!! I love klutz products, cause I am one!! Highly recommended!!	2001-05-28

I was reading back in one of my old diaries today--and i came across a sentence that read: you are most like the character--and there was a blank. I had written Margaret. I knew exactly where it came from. I think I read it in 4th or 5th grade and I just remember it made me feel like the author understood what we were going through--and how could she have remembered all that? i swallowed up the details and I laughed and felt bad for the character. I thought it was funny about what a big deal the periods for the girls were---and how she was struggling with religion and what she should believe. I have recommended this to some parents for their daughters but I worry that the \\"religion choosing\\" thing might bother them. I loved this book and i think every young girl should read this book. It was written 20 or 30 years ago and she still understood what i was going through!!	2001-05-16

I thought she was a non perfect person that a lot of women could relate to--with her insecurity, her feeling of desperation when it came to getting her boyfriend back, etc!! I read this book in four days or so (i even dumped another book i was reading to finish this one!!!) There was even a part in the book where i thought &quot;whoa, i never thought that would have happened!!&quot; but i can't say what it is, cause it would spoil it!! But, there were some things that I also had a problem with... the friendship with the movie star for instance---wouldn't happen!! maybe im just one of those people that don't always want a happy ending because that's just not the way it is. but, overall, i thought that the book was a quick read (kind of like reading an elizabeth berg book or some other girl-y book) and if you are like me---you will feel connected to the main character. Oh, I also loved how she didn't have to change herself physically to have everything work out perfectly. Its about time we have books like this!! not everyone in the world is a size 6!! and just cause you are a size 6, it doesn't mean you are going to be happy!! (ok, lecture over) read this book!!	2001-05-16

I don't even remember the details of why i liked this book so much, but I can tell you the way it made me feel. Maybe this was the first book that inspired me, or made me pick Psychology as my major. Maybe it was the fact it showed me that cancer survivors can live normal lives or it taught me about mind over matter.. it was such a long time ago but I know that I remembered this book---its like you see a good movie or read a book that makes you feel like you can acomplish anything! that's what this book did for me.	2001-05-16

I don't need to, to write a review!! this book is hilarious!! I was recommended David Sedaris by a friend who was reading Naked, and we have taken turns reading chapters out loud to each other. I would be at work reading to myself, and my boss had to ask me what was making me crack up so much!!! I don't normally laugh out loud when reading a book, but he is great!! not only is he funny, he writes the words in a way that you can hear his voice (even if you have never heard him speak before) .. my favorite so far is the essay about his french class! I highly recommend this book!	2001-05-08
US	49785275	R1MYYB778DAW2O	0802137008	910496991	Pure	Books	1	4	5	N	N	let down	I saw this book and thought i would give it a try because the first page or so looked interesting, and it caught my attention that the author dropped out of school at 16 to write this book. Maybe she should have stayed in school, or at least, take a writing class. I don't know how things like this get published. She goes on for 3-400 pages about descriptions that aren't even important, she brings up subjects about how she likes to be pushed around or hit by her 31 year old boyfriend when she is 14 or how her best girl friend appears to be in love with her, but she doesn't reach any farther than that. its as if she got tired of writing and decided just to let things lie as if it would be more &quot;mysterious&quot; or something. I kept on with it, giving it a chance, hoping it would get better, but i reached the end and felt sad when I could have been reading something better. Too vague, too long, too bad. :(	2001-02-19

I loved this book, like the other Veronique Vienne books! In a time and culture that makes you feel like you have to be everything to everyone, and look good in the process, this makes you want to be yourself and remember that people don't like perfect people anyway!! They like people who are like themselves!! Don't you love hearing from other people, &quot;oh my gosh!! i do that too!! i thought i was the only one who does that!!&quot; its about quirks (and how beautiful it makes us as an individual) how imperfections make you unique, and that we should have a sense of humor about it... cause no one is perfect, and the most interesting people to me are the most &quot;imperfect.&quot; Now if you will excuse me, i have to go watch threes company on nick at nite.. (see? i watch it too!) :) PS... the pictures in the book are amazing as well and really adds something to it.	2001-02-19

She inspires me to the fullest and I think that this is probably the best book she has written, out of all of the books I've read. She covers all topics: healing, sexuality, fat, and creativity! I think we need more authors like her to make us feel empowered and happy and to help us realize that we can be imperfect, yet still wonderful!	2000-04-19
