Is he unemployed, having a day off, or perhaps a stay-at-home dad?<br /><br />In Little Pumpkin's story, not only is the grandmother of this black baby rather white, she's also rather young - at least, young enough to still have blonde hair.  And is she babysitting, or - like many grandmas these days - actually raising Little Pumpkin?<br /><br />Finally, I love the illustrations that accompany the Little Bird story because as the baby sleeps, the mother is converting a sofa/daybed to a cozy sleeping place for the baby.  Not every baby has her own bedroom, and not every family can afford a crib or toddler bed.<br /><br />It amazes me every time I read the story that Little Bird is no less loved than a baby with a more elaborate nursery.  These may seem like little things, but I believe even babies look for themselves in the stories we read to them.  In More More More, my baby - who has no nursery of her own - will see the kind of unconditional love that transcends ethnic or economic stereotypes.<br /><br />The tone of this book is soothing, though the lilting words and some phrases were a little odd for me at first (\\"little guy's father has to run so hard just to catch that baby up\\").  But through repetitions and simple, uncomplicated rhythms, this is a lovely going-to-bed book once you've got its cadences down pat.<br /><br />This is a marvellous book for a wide range of ages... my sleepy 9-year-old daughter still loves to listen to it, along with her 4-month-old sister.  Get this book and then \\"catch your baby up\\" to share it with her!sten to it, along with her 4-month-old sister.  Get this book and then \\"catch your baby up\\" to share it with her!	2005-07-04

I guess it must be about 10 years later and Reiser's gentle, loving humour is still funny & fresh throughout this, my third pregnancy.  I also love it because it's from a dad's perspective, so you don't get mired down in all the whining that all us mommies tend to do (even the funniest of it).  Reiser is cute and clueless but touchingly genuine throughout the whole experience; this is one you'll read over & over and even maybe pass on to others as they embark upon this madcap journey into parenthood...	2005-02-09

Little choking noises, big chortling noises, running over to my husband to share some of these pictures with him.<br /><br />Brown wallpaper matching sofas, matching matching rugs -- with an innocent turquoise lampshade trapped in the middle of it all... at first, one can only ask, \\"what were they thinking?\\"<br /><br />But then, perhaps, one can also look around and think, \\"which of these trendy rooms will look this way in 30 years?!?\\"  Let this book be a warning to interior decorators everywhere and anyone who's ever been suckered in by those glossy home magazines touting the latest in architectural and home fashions!!!<br /><br />Highly recommended, along with Lileks' \\"Gallery of Regrettable Food\\" for anyone with a sense of humour who isn't TOO defensive about this particular era.	2005-02-09

However, I also noticed that some of the signs Briant mentions aren't included in the book at all - most notably, \\"WHAT?\\".<br />This is a sign she refers to all over the place, yet it doesn't seem to be included among the 60 that she provides.<br /><br />I realize that a book this size has to limit what is included... and it definitely leaves you wanting more, perhaps a full-sized book to leave at home and this one to take on the road while you're just beginning to sign.<br /><br />I really like Briant's common-sense approach:  you don't have to start too young, make it fun, introduce just a few new words at a time - all of this is easier on baby, and definitely easier on YOU.<br /><br />But I did get the sense that this book may outlive its usefulness pretty quickly once you have both mastered the 60 basic signs included... and that the \\"front-of-the-book stuff,\\" the sales pitch for baby signing, is a little light & thin on details for repeated re-reading.<br /><br />I will try to report back in about a year, once I have an actual baby to practice signing on and let you know what my final verdict will be.  :-)))<br /><br />UPDATE:  She signs back!<br />(a little)<br />Have been using signs with my baby since 6-7 months, and last week she started signing back (a little)... (she's now 11.5 months).  We are still using just the ten \\"beginning\\" signs most systems recommend.  Basic things like POTTY, MORE, etc.  And last week, the baby signed MORE.  She can also sign MUSIC and is starting to put her hand to her head for BED when she's sleepy.  It is the cutest thing in the world and she is soooo proud of herself.<br />Will update this review - hopefully! - in about 6 months.in about 6 months.	2005-01-14

This approach has stood me in good stead through an often-overwhelming deluge of baby-store paraphernalia.<br /><br />However, I was annoyed later on in the book by her defensive approach to the idea of moms (specifically herself) working outside of the home, and found this inconsistent with her general feelings of caring for her kids.  She explains that children are enriched through exposure to a variety of caregivers... enriched, perhaps (if we are lucky enough to afford halfway-decent English-speaking, knowledgeable caregivers -- most of us aren't!), but perhaps traumatized also by the absence of the one person they thought had committed to care for them forever.<br /><br />Anyway, a good book, funny, touching and true in many ways, but the last section was definitely a turn-off for this reason.	2005-01-03

Iovine won't give you much in terms of learning about how to care for a baby... this is a book for US!<br /><br />This book is honest, direct and FUN to read, even before you deliver, although she is painfully honest about a few things that you probably won't want to think too hard about until after your baby arrives.  (but who gets a chance to read then, anyway, really?)<br /><br />Because she veers off the traditional how-to-diaper-a-baby / what-to-do-if-they-cry formula, some reviewers have found this book &#34;depressing&#34;, disappointing inconsistent or unwise medically.  This is NOT a medical book.  It is NOT a baby-care book.<br /><br />Some say it's overwhelming to read about the challenges on the road ahead.  They should stick with the perky books that tell you that you can get your baby on a schedule painlessly by the age of &#60;however-many&#62; weeks.  This book won't do that.<br /><br />Iovine tells you you'll be sleepless, so you'd better drive carefully.  She tells you you will be in pain, so get other people to help out whenever you can.  She points out that even if you can get baby on a schedule, he or she may not stick with it for more than a few days at a time before a growth spurt or teething or other changes kick in to undermine the whole thing.<br /><br />This, like the pregnancy Girlfriend's Guide, is fun reading and realistic for MANY women (not all).  And it reminds us to focus on caring for ourselves, something we may lose sight of in the<br /><br />months ahead.  Also, that no matter what shape you're in when you come out of the delivery room, you WILL recover.<br /><br />This is a terrific book, especially if you're looking for a change from all the baby whispering type books that are around these days.	2004-11-10

Pregnancy BBS's are riddled with the abbreviation \\"TMI,\\" meaning \\"too much information,\\" which drives me crazy.  Posters use it when they're about to timidly discuss the really horrible aspects of pregnancy, usually involving orifices or bodily fluids.<br /><br />Well, you won't find the abbreviation in Jenny McCarthy's book, and that's 'cuz there's apparently no such thing as \\"TMI\\" in her world.  Orifices & fluids aplenty:  what a refreshing approach!<br /><br />I read this book, then passed it along to my husband so he can see that even glamourous, beautiful celebrities suffer from hemmorrhoids and other afflictions.<br /><br />This book is down to earth.

As the Publisher's Weekly review suggests, Graham's first essay, &quot;Member of the Club,&quot; is the highlight of the collection, head and shoulders above the rest.<br />Beyond that essay, which I have also heard excerpted on This American Life, I found this book somewhat uneven.  I, too, was troubled by his rationale behind cosmetic surgery to make his nose look &quot;less black.&quot;<br />However, I found this book useful for the obvious reason that it is a window, albeit a somewhat blurry one, into a world I will never know first-hand.  I have to admit, though, I kept asking myself whether Graham's upbringing and ivy league education truly represented the mainstream experience -- whether he's that much more a part of &quot;blackness&quot; than, say, I am?<br />Graham writes well and articulately, though most of his work lacks the immediacy of &quot;Member of the Club.&quot;  I did go on from this book to read &quot;Our Kind of People,&quot; Graham's chronicle of the black upper class.  I was less impressed with that book, and my interest petered out midway through.  As a lower-class white person, I guess I was kind of horrified by all that privilege, no matter what colour the person is who's wielding it.  :-)	2003-08-10

Unfortunately, Coupland kills off the most likeable character in the first chapter, and the rest of the book kind of struggles from that point to find a stable footing, never quite accomplishing it.<br /><br />\\"Hey, Nostradamus\\" is readable enough, with echoes of \\"Girlfriend in a Coma,\\" as Cheryl's family and friends try to find meaning in the message of her demise.  However, I came to the end wishing she'd just woken up to answer some of the questions and heal some of the broken lives.<br /><br />Coupland chooses to end with the least sympathetic of the four protagonists, and I thought this was a mistake.  Really, if I'd put it down after Cheryl's segment, I might have been content.  After Jason's, maybe still.  Beyond that, the thread that pulled this book along was never quite re-connected, and my patience, at least, was gone.<br /><br />If you're new to Coupland, stick with Girlfriend in a Coma, for the same teeny-bopper angst and time-travel elements, drawn together in a much more optimistic, philosophical, and cohesive way.  If you're a fan looking for your next fix, well, go ahead and buy it, but this probably won't be your new favourite.<br /><br />*** POSTSCRIPT ON RE-READING A FEW MONTHS LATER ***<br /><br />On re-reading this book, I decided it wasn't a bad thing to end with Reg, the unsympathetic father character.  A strange thing, perhaps, and highly unexpected.  Yet Coupland writes it well and pulls it off.  I still like Girlfriend in a Coma better, but this is a worthy new novel.  Enjoy!	2003-08-10

In this collection, Schreiber gently re-introduces the issue of religious hair covering, which for most Jewish women is simply Not Discussed.  Either they do it or they don't...and most would never consider doing otherwise.<br />This book opens the door to dialogue on a subject that's usually hushed up; dialogue not just between women, but between husbands and wives, mothers and daughters, religious and non-religious -- if those distinctions even make any sense, given the free flow and open intellectual exchange surging among all the essays gathered here.<br />Schreiber has collected writings from women who have always covered their hair, with sheitels (wigs), tichels (scarves) and everything in between, some hating it and others cherishing the opportunity, women who used to cover their hair and stopped, women who never covered their hair and started doing it.<br />Women's voices come through loud and clear in this unique collection:  one started in her 60's following chemotherapy; another wrestled with the issue for years, insisting on covering her hair even as she went around in jeans.  A chassidic woman writes of her joy as her mother-in-law arrived to shave her hair off the morning after her wedding... while another says she's still struggling with concealing her proud mane, even years into her marriage.<br />This mitzvah -- or custom, depending on who you ask (and all opinions are represented here, proving the issue isn't entirely black-and-white) -- isn't the no-questions-asked litmus test of frumkeit (religiousness) that I once thought.<br />There are important questions here that we all need to answer for ourselves... questions which have been silenced for a very long time.  Break the silence by sharing this book with other women around you.	2003-07-16

This is more than a travel book; it'll take you into the underside, and the overside, and every side Vancouver has.<br />Vancouver is lushly fertile and starkly commercial, historical and modern; Vancouver is Every City, with an emergent personality all its own.

This is a butch, almost brutal science fiction novel that can hold its own against Max Barry or any of the &quot;cult&quot; new writers.  I had to keep peeking at the author picture to remind myself that I was still reading Atwood.<br />I have felt that her books, though always beautiful and lucid, have gotten more cluttered lately.  Oryx and Crake pares all that away and returns to basics:  What does &quot;extinction&quot; really mean?  What qualities make us human?  Is scientific &quot;progress&quot; always for the good?<br />This book's dustcover draws tired-sounding comparisons with Handmaid's Tale which bely the true essence of this book.  Just about the only thing they have in common is that they're both set in the future.<br />Where Handmaid's Tale was centred around women and their bodies, this newest work embraces us as a species, from a largely male viewpoint.  It ripples with both vigourous youth and wise experience; it's absolutely a delight.	2003-05-14

I don't know; maybe it's because I'm a Canadian, but I really don't get what people see in Vowell.  Maybe it's the appeal of the \\"young-smart history-nerd combo,\\" like somebody thinks that's a rare thing.  Probably all of the above plus a dash of great writing and a sprinkling of apple pie spice for Old Glory.<br />Personally, though, I couldn't find in this book the howlingly funny curmudgeon that reviews here had led me to expect.  Some insight, perhaps, though I felt myself wishing she was writing from a little more experience.<br />Maybe it's like that thing with airline pilots, imagining them with salt-and-pepper hair and, though their hands are steady, just a trace of crows' feet around the eyes.<br />Deep down, maybe I prefer my historians and history buffs to be way older than me.  Vowell is probably a great way for younger audiences to get into political issues, but -- and maybe it loses something, not hearing it read aloud in her own voice! -- I personally found it hard to get excited about her causes, and harder to empathize with her odd American passions.	2003-05-14

From what I've seen of Rosie O'Donnell, she's entirely self-absorbed, her quest of &quot;single parenthood&quot; being only one illustration of her &quot;me-first&quot; universe.  THAT SAID, I love adoption, and I was intrigued by the premise, so I picked this book up.  And I enjoyed it, which is why I set out to write a good review.<br />But as I wrote this review, I kept coming back to a few flaws until, finally, I went back up and changed my mark to a 3.<br />First, the story is probably not as Big or as Intense as Rosie would have us believe.  Yes, it is a fascinating story, and it's relatively well-told, with enough enjoyable moments that I made it all the way through -- in a single sitting.<br />BUT... I'm not *that* fast a reader; for a 200-some-odd-page book, there's a lot of fluff and white space.<br />As for what it's a story about, well...I'm not quite sure.  We're meant to come away with the impression that Rosie is Full of Love, that her heart bleeds for young birth mothers.<br />BUT...in the meantime, she dumps her *own* kids with a nanny so she can get on with her career.  Apparently, she feels no empathy for them; they're not pregnant teenagers, I guess (yet!).<br />This book has been lauded for its honesty, which is what we say anytime a star brings herself down to our level.  That, this book certainly does, and it does create an interesting story around Rosie's relationship with a vulnerable young woman.<br />BUT... ultimately, it is &quot;Real&quot; and &quot;Honest&quot; only in a cloying, self-conscious way that contrasts bitterly with the details of the real life that O'Donnell has tried to acquire for herself.<br />She bought herself a couple of babies, she bought herself a career, and now, with this book, she's trying to buy herself a halo.  She'd probably do better trying to *earn* it by making time for the kids she has already misguidedly brought into her life...rather than by chasing complete strangers over the Internet.	2003-02-11

As a \\"state of the nation,\\" this book is a touchingly honest reflection on many contemporary Jewish realities -- or, at least, *Conservative* Jewish realities, since I'm not so sure the situation described here could have arisen in either an Orthodox or Reform congregation.<br />This book plunges the reader into the midst of a typical American Jewish community as it searches for a leader -- and for an enduring identity for itself and its movement.  You learn who's who and share all the gossip -- perhaps even a little too much of the gossip, as Fried reveals the intricate star system of \\"hot\\" rabbis and pulpits around the country.<br />Along the way, Fried takes his own baby steps towards finding a grown-up spiritual identity.  This \\"memoir\\" side of the book is honest without being navel-gazing, a relief after some other recent books which go too far in the introspective direction.  Most authors' spiritual quests are NOT worthy of a book in themselves, and luckily, Fried seems aware of that fact.<br />This book will inevitably draw comparisons with Paul Wilkes' \\"And They Shall Be My People: An American Rabbi and His Congregation\\" -- indeed, Fried mentions Wilkes' book at one point! -- and like Wilkes, Fried doesn't really offer any big answers about where the Conservative movement is going.<br />But for those who have already written the movement off as a vital force, both books will make you think again... at least briefly.  Conservative Judaism ain't dead, yet, and with fine authors like these on the pulse of the movement, it'll probably be beating for some time to come.	2003-02-11

But after dozens of &quot;star tragedies,&quot; I worried that it would be overly precious in coming down to &quot;my level.&quot;  Or, worse, Drescher might put on airs, acting like a bigger star than she actually is.<br />To my relief, she dodged these bullets elegantly.  Her voice carries the day:  she is of the common people because she talks like the common people.  But she IS a star, and her story relates all-too-poignantly how the &quot;star treatment&quot; almost killed her.<br />This abridgement captures the spirit of the book and the lady so tangibly that I could have sworn she was standing there in the car with me on my commute.<br />In her own ummistakable words, Drescher indeed shows us how the &quot;other half&quot; lives, but also relates an unforgettable  message for all of us -- that we must be vigilant about our medical care; that cancer is a great equalizer.<br />This book's bitter pills are sweetened to palatability by Drescher's sardonic wisecracking and, of course, the Voice.  &quot;Cancer Schmancer&quot; is a mature and helpful book, fun and funny, but also thoughtful and meaningful.	2003-02-11

I've read &quot;The Giant's House,&quot; I've read, &quot;Niagara Falls,&quot; and then, there is this truly unforgettable collection of characters... and they are truly a collection.<br />What McCracken is selling here is the kind of figurines you'd order from an 800 number and store for posterity on a handsome pine display shelf.  Except these &quot;figurines&quot; are sculpted in words, some of the most beautiful, haunting, captivating words you can imagine.  And they're all set in stories, each one a limited-edition display piece of cutting wit and honest, hopeful humanity.<br />I'd say Elizabeth McCracken is, along with Lorrie Moore, my favourite &quot;emerging&quot; fictioneer, and I am breathlessly awaiting her next entry.  Frankly, I'd happily read her shopping lists while I'm waiting, desperately soaking up as many of her fabulous words as I can.	2003-01-05

I was hoping for a little depth, a little insight, a little of the sexual tension that's so clear in other classic prep-school novels to which The Coming Storm has inevitably been compared.<br />There are a couple of promising relationships established here, but their potential is never realized.  This book is characterized mostly by lost opportunity, as the potential for character and situational depth gives way to simplistic stereotyping that could just as easily have been composed by a homophobe as by one within the fold.<br />Obviously, St Martin's Press (a/k/a Stonewall Inn Editions, their queer imprint) has no problem promoting mediocrity.  I just hate to think of all the talented gay writers who are having a tough time breaking in while this ditzy author and his fluff novel gets all the glory.<br />P.S.  What dimwit picked this title?

She is just as wise as that rabbi ever was, though, leading us straight to a happy ending your kids (mine are 6 and 8) will enjoy over and over.<br />Forest has chosen a loose, semi-rhyming scheme which is soothing but never predictable or \\"doggerel-ish.\\"  And the ending, though it IS predictable, is delightful when it comes, as this beleaguered \\"baalabos\\" (homeowner) is finally able to get some rest.	2002-11-06

Ahuvah Gray's story is different.<br />Readers will surely find it wonderfully refreshing to discover that Gray's Jewish life is rooted firmly in the teachings of her Christian grandmother.  Gray's Judaism is not a rejection of Christianity, but a natural outgrouth of her quest for Emes, truth, begun years before she ever set foot in eretz Yisrael (Israel).<br />Having just come from hearing Gray speak in person in Toronto, I have witnessed first-hand how many people, Jews and non-Jews alike, were moved by her words.  The Jewish world needs more dedicated, spiritually energized \\"pilgrims\\" like Ahuvah Gray, and I am proud to be able to call her MY sister, the Jew.	2002-10-07

(0 star review)<br /><br />Happened across this book in the library, and I thought I'd put in a few words against it, since it's doubtless highly recommended among books to help kids \\"cope\\" with alcoholism in the family; that is, if your idea of teaching children to cope is training them to accept their fate, bury it in euphemism, and move on from one depressing day of abuse to another in the shadow of what this book seeks to excuse as a sickness.<br /><br />The father in this book is typically horrendous, lying and near-abusing his daughter, yet the non-alcoholic mother insists on keeping her child in this situation, breaking down in tears rather than offering a beacon of safety in what must be the poor child's hopeless world.<br /><br />True, this book is realistic.  Yet I cannot imagine any parent or counsellor offering it to a child, since it doesn't offer any real advice besides<br />a) alcoholism is something to be ashamed of (the girl says she used to not have anyone she could talk to about her father, but now her mother has one friend she CAN confide in)<br />b) feel free to get out for an evening of fun before returning to the same bad situation.<br /><br />Yuck, yuck and double-yuck.  I'm all for building a body of fiction to help kids cope with issues, but this is a nasty addition to the bunch and could destroy more than a few already-fragile kids...<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT, added June 16, 2010:<br />As adults, it's OUR job to protect kids.  You wouldn't buy a book called \\"Pedophilia:  my uncle has a disease and he can't help molesting me.\\"  Or would you?<br />If you're thinking of giving a child a book that encourages her to excuse a parent's inexcusable behaviour, please:  skip the \\"understanding\\" literature and get the child out of the situation if you can.	2002-07-12

I cannot tell you how impressed I am with this book's holistic  approach to Hebrew learning.  It teaches the language in exactly the right spiritual context and with immense respect for the versatility and beauty of the language.<br />This is the book I have been looking for for years -- the perfect guide for adults who are looking to continue their study, adding both understanding and practical reading skills.  It starts simple, covering concepts like root words, prefixes and suffixes.  Each chapter is an easy-to-swallow bite of the whole; by the end of the book, students will be able to understand and follow HUGE chunks of services in almost any synagogue.<br />Though this book is put out by the Reform movement, and is intended, most likely, for converts and others within that movement, the selections are almost entirely universal -- what this book has to offer can benefit adult beginners of any denomination.<br />One of this book's biggest strengths is that it offers a sampling of how the same Hebrew passages are translated in different siddurim and texts; what a fantastic way to introduce students to the breadth of the Jewish experience!  It also lightens up the educational experience by adding tidbits of Jewish knowledge and philosophy along the way.<br />There's also a set of flashcards available to go with this book.  If you can't buy that at Amazon, though, go ahead and make your own.  With those plus this book, you'll be well equipped to navigate your way through any siddur you come across!	2002-06-26

Ehrenreich expertly dodges the glibness potential inherent in her \\"dressing up as trailer trash\\" premise.

This is one of our perennial read-aloud favourites.  As a previous reviewer points out, it IS a little strange; in our house, that's what makes it stand out from the run of the mill.  You never know exactly WHY the baby is called a \\"bad baby\\" even before the story begins -- but that makes it even more intriguing for kids.<br />And of course, the art does look dated and peculiar, and the words (\\"crisps,\\" \\"sweet shop\\") are all kind of funny to my kids.  Also, because we're Jewish, when I read it, I say \\"meat store man\\" instead of \\"pork butcher,\\" so as not to offend my kids' kosher sensibilities!  But all of these quirks just make it more fun to read and -- judging from their reactions -- all the more fun to listen to.<br />The story is straightforward and fun -- a baby and its kleptomaniac elephant friend go out for a romp on the town, a romp which culminates when the elephant decides that the baby is not polite enough and must be brought home for pancakes.  That's the basic plot, but it is thrillingly executed in a classic style.<br />We have been taking this book out of the library regularly for years, and my only fear is that we and other fans of this book will eventually wear out their single copy -- leaving us without this one-of-a-kind gem!!!	2002-06-17

This book is a fun, low-key, high-quality way to introduce kids to the miracles of development and birth.  Mine (6 and 7) were less interested in the pictures of actual babies as they were in those of the developing fetuses, and their long looks over each page allowed plenty of time for my narration -- about how much each of them was wanted, about how amazing it is that a real baby can be so tiny, and so on.<br />My daughter seemed a little uncomfortable with one of the pictures, which depicts a woman \\"giving birth\\" -- you do see the side of her hip exposed, in a fairly realistic position, but there's not much more skin visible here than you might see on a beach.  I think overall, the pluses here -- especially allowing kids to see the developing fetus as an actual baby -- outweigh any possible drawbacks (the very slight nudity).<br />As \\"facts of life\\" books go, this one is full of fascinating facts, doesn't dodge any tricky issues, and can help instill a much-needed sense of reverence around the whole process.<br />NOTE:  There is nothing in this book about how babies get made in the first place.  If that's what you're looking for -- and in my case, it was, in part -- you will need other books to cover THAT information.	2002-05-14

DeBaggio gathers snippets about the disease from medical journals and mixes them with his own perceptions from the inside of a brain gone bad.<br />At times, I admit to feeling frustrated with his \\"wallowing\\" -- repeating over and over the gloomiest sorts of thoughts about his imminent death. Much more affecting, in my opinion, were his insights into the role of memory in forming our human minds, and how tenuous our life becomes when memory is no longer reliable.<br />For anyone dealing with the early stages of this disease, this book is a treasure -- uplifting and thought-provoking. Limited by its very nature, it cannot show much of what lies beyond the short \\"early dementia\\" period DeBaggio is capable of cataloguing. But beyond that, as DeBaggio says, we must all embark on our own journey, our own struggle with words and our own grapplings with memory.<br />Even for someone like myself who is, thank God, not coping with Alzheimer's, this is that rare book that offers readers a chance to hold the author's hand as he is unwillingly tugged along the first few steps of one of the most hellish of human journeys.	2002-05-14

This book really took me by surprise; as both history and memoir, this is definitely NOT my usual \\"type.\\"<br />Reading almost like a novel for all its southern warmth and charm, this memoir evokes a vivid time and place that will never exist again.  Through her delightful and unforgettable characters, Suberman tells the story of a family who never quite finds a home -- until, too late, they realize Concordia -- the pseudonymous town in which her family lived -- had perhaps been home all along.<br />This is a book about Jews in small towns, but it is also a book about strangers of all kinds, and towns of all kinds.  Its lessons are never trite or cheap; in fact, the lessons here, if there are any, are bittersweet with right and wrong choices of all kinds.<br />This is the story of a family that could be any family, and about the kind of success that goes beyond the material -- that forges a lasting legacy for generations to come.  Worthwhile reading for anyone who's ever wondered about the other side of history; the stories that don't always get told...	2002-05-14

Why not?  Their daughter's grown up and far away; why NOT just skip the nuisance and take a cruise?<br />Thus begins Grisham's attempt at a seasonal fable of pseudo-Dickensian proportions... and this is pretty much where it fizzles, too.  You see, everything goes wrong for the Kranks (maybe you could have guessed it would from their names!), with the whole thing ending in a debacle I won't reveal in case you do decide to waste your time reading this thing.<br />This annoying little book amounts to little more than a tract for peace, joy and goodwill among men -- as expressed in the only way Grisham apparently sees fit:  with a tree and lights and an electric Frostie propped up on your roof.<br />Grisham's smeared-thick moralism might not be out of place in a seasonal sermon, but in a book targeted for popular consumption... well, like every heavy, super-sticky, rich meal I've ever eaten, it just didn't seem to sit right.<br />I could handle A Painted House; honest, I could.  I'd love to support Grisham's attempts to burst out of the apparently-oppressive mold his best-selling legal thrillers have imprisoned him in.  But I can't vouch for Skipping Christmas for the plain & simple reason that it stinks.<br />Believe it or not, Christmas isn't all about big parties, bright trees, presents and carols.  It's not even all about family and love.  For Christians, it's about the birth of a messiah who brought God's message of hope to a pagan world.<br />And for us non-Christians...?  Well, Christmas is a time when we hope our Christian neighbours will live up to that message and treat us with the kind of tolerance that doesn't attempt to force everybody on the block into some image of cookie-cutter perfection.<br />I consider this book only one step up from hate literature, with non-Christmas people depicted as outcasts and humbugs, if not downright evil for undermining the spirit of the season.  There are better, warmer Christmas stories, every one of them more true to the holiday's real message than this icky confection.season.

Forgive me for saying so, but I suspect the quotes from Puff Daddy, Dr. Laura and the like perhaps lost something in the translation to O'Reilly's bemused but determined tones.<br />This format also makes it hard to tell what's an actual source quote and what's O'Reilly's paraphrase.  And no matter who's being quoted, it seems that O'Reilly always gets the last word.  I'm sure he would say that if someone wants the last word, they should get their own audiobook, but he just comes across as smug and overly triumphant -- a shame when most of these conversations end in such calm, cool moral and intellectual victories for O'Reilly.<br />While I generally enjoy hearing non-fiction audiobooks read by the author, I believe this book might have been one better experienced in print form.  It would probably be more enjoyable imagining the different voices than hearing O'Reilly debating these pithy issues with *himself*.  As it is, it tends to become one-sided and pointless after a while.	2002-03-07

I got this book for my daughter, a little girl who, like Sophie, can get very VERY angry at times.  We read it together, and then she went through it on her own, staring in amazement at the dazzling illustrations which show clearly the power of Sophie's rage.  Our favourite was the one where Sophie, at the peak of her anger, fills the page with a giant R-O-A-R before heading off to console herself in her special tree.<br />The book's ending is absolutely perfect.  When she's ready -- and not before -- Sophie is welcomed back into the warmth of her home; everything is back together again, the cat purring contentedly beneath Sophie's painting of her family, whole and perfect.  For any child who might worry that he or she has done something unforgivably bad (don't they all, at some point?), this book will offer much-needed reassurance that their family will be waiting when their anger has passed.	2002-01-22

I'm a bit of a scrooge anyway, so these stories were the perfect December read for me, with their odd combination of cynicism and holiday spirit.  Like Sedaris' other work, these stories are often laugh-out-loud funny, so read with caution and be prepared to share bits with whoever happens to be sitting nearby, because Sedaris' writing is too big and bold to just lie there passively on the page.

This is a book I could never before have read with an open mind.<br />Fifteen years ago, I'd have dismissed Ner-David as an apologist for Orthodoxy, trying to cram modern sensibilities into a hopelessly outdated mold.  Ten years ago, during my own tumultuous &quot;return,&quot; I'd have sneered at her willingness to entertain thoughts of mixed seating, uncovered hair and egalitarian prayer.<br />It's only now, I think, that I'm ready to hear the honest questions Ner-David and others like her are asking and to understand that the Judaism we share is resilient enough to answer to -- and thrive from -- challenge and diversity.<br />Ner-David's narrative, interwoven with threads dealing with her own physical frailty, tells a story not of a senseless rebellion against Orthodoxy but of a young woman's awakening to a deeper, more genuine love of her tradition.<br />I wish Ms Ner-David a Yasher Kocheich -- may she never stop asking.	2002-01-03

I've seen a few knock-offs of this story, and actually, they're all based on a classic Yiddish folktale, so I guess they have the right.  But in my mind -- and my kids'! -- Gilman's sweet take on this tale of old-world frugality and love will always be the &quot;classic.&quot;<br />Gilman's richly colourful paintings are full of action, vivid cross-sections depicting events playing out in all the rooms of Joseph's house, out on the street, and even in the cellar where a growing family of mice plays out a surprising &quot;bonus&quot; story of their own.<br />The characters here are all believable; Joseph is as mischievous and playful as any modern child.  And the time flow in this book is exquisite:  as in life, Gilman's transforms Joseph from page in subtle but certain stages, bringing him from early childhood into his cheder years.<br />This is a story kids will love to listen to over and over, and even adults will enjoy making new discoveries within the familiar illustrations.  A superlative gift for any child, one which will grow with them and be cherished for years to come.	2002-01-03

Stories from a Yeshiva	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Sweet, funny, touching... and REAL	In this short but sweet book, Albarelli, a non-Jew, ventures behind the walls of one of Brooklyn's many yeshivas, discovering the often-touching human face behind the stereotypes, and learning more about himself as a process.<br />Albarelli is clearly the hero of his own story, particularly in contrast to the other English &quot;teachers&quot; in the yeshiva, who treat the kids like animals.  But the students, too, and the principals, come across as heroes, if heroes of a different kind.  Albarelli paints the school's characters with crude strokes -- writing down their Brooklyn Yiddish accents almost syllable for syllable, for instance -- but the overall effect is surprisingly delicate.<br />Though Albarelli never fully becomes one of the chassidim, in the end, he is accepted and -- even more important -- he is beginning to understand their world and world-view.  This book is a surprising gem, a sympathetic but realistic portrait of a universe most of us will never see for ourselves.  I read it in an afternoon, but its sentences -- reading almost like self-conscious fiction -- and its message will likely stay with me for years.	2001-10-23

Two of kids' most exciting themes -- loose teeth and international travel! -- are delightfully captured in this sophisticated book by Peter Sis.  Madlenka's tooth sends her on a journey through her multi-cultural neighbourhood, visiting shopkeeper friends from Asia, France, Latin America, and beyond.<br />Though the thrill of the loose tooth seems to disappear into the background somewhat through all her marvellous adventures, it comes back with a bang in the terrific &quot;surprise&quot; ending.  This book perplexed my kids (5 and 6) somewhat initially; they were expecting a story about the tooth.  But they enjoyed the easy-going, &quot;world beat&quot; plot tremendously nevertheless, particularly the detailed illustrations of the shopkeepers' home cultures, delightfully woven around the facing pages.<br />I'd highly recommended this book for urban families or anyone who wants their kids to know we're not alone on this big crowded planet.	2001-10-19

Originally published in story form as &quot;How the Animals Took a Bath&quot; in a children's magazine, this was recently &quot;rediscovered&quot; and published as &quot;The Dirty Little Boy,&quot; mostly -- I suspect -- to make a quick buck from the Margaret Wise Brown craze that has brought us such lovely recent books as &quot;Two Little Trains.&quot;  However, this is definitely not her best, which is probably why it was never published in book form before.<br />What story there is here is annoying and brutally simplistic... this boy, apparently the stupidest kid in the world, is told by his big fat mother (also apparently lacking in intellectual capacity), to go off and take a bath like the animals do.<br />The illustrations are generic and cheerful, with the slightly-clever addition of touchable &quot;slippery&quot; patches to accentuate mud puddles and the like, but the boy's rather obvious experiments bored my children almost immediately, as he idiotically dove into puddles (like birds) or scraped his legs with a horse-comb (like horses).<br />The book's finale ploddingly offers the only &quot;real&quot; solution -- too late, the big fat mother comes to her senses and gives the stupid annoying kid a REAL bath.  To which my kids (5 and 7) were pretty much saying, &quot;Well, duh.&quot;<br />This book might be of some use with very young children who will enjoy the animal pictures and the slippery illustrations -- and, most importantly, who won't care that the story is vacuous and dumb.  But by the time they're old enough to realize that there are better stories out there, they'll want to hear one of those instead.	2001-10-19

The &quot;clever girl heroine&quot; idea is not a new one, and Osborne (of Magic Treehouse fame) will disappoint many fans with this book which -- though critically acclaimed for breaking new ground -- is actually a rather ho-hum retelling of the original which will be entirely predictable to parents who are forced to read this thing aloud.<br />The traditional &quot;fee-fi-fo-fum&quot; that resonates so well in the original is here supplanted by &quot;fee-fi-fo-fum-un,&quot; to rhyme better with &quot;woman,&quot; and that's just the start of where this book goes wrong.  Osborne holds Kate up as a heroine before a generation who -- thanks to great books like &quot;The Paperbag Princess&quot; -- are already aware that girls can hold their own in a fable.  Osborne forces this point, and her version comes across as more polemic than enchanting.<br />Potter's illustrations are bright and cheerful in her signature style, which works well in other books, but which (again, dare I say it?) seems a little too ugly for the fairy-tale genre.  And I suspect they'll make this book look rather dated in just a few years, though your kids will probably tire of this story long before then.<br />My kids (5 and 6) had somehow never heard the original &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; story before.  They enjoyed this version enough on its first telling, but haven't asked to hear it again.  Osborne's version clearly lacks the timelessness of the original.	2001-10-19

We recently discovered this book and, given the word &quot;die&quot; in the title, I wasn't so sure it would be appropriate.  I was quickly reassured by the good-natured tone of Allard's prose, and the kids (5 and 7, both reading) had a great time hunting for quirky &quot;in-jokes&quot; in the background on each page (like a picture, hanging in the Stupids' home, of three beach balls with the caption &quot;The Pyramids&quot;).<br />This book was originally published in the 1977, and it's amazing to see how innocent its prose is in contrast to kids' books today.  But this book is never dull or didactic, and it will delight the entire family over and over, while its simple dialogue will thrill early readers (when the lights go out, the Stupids simply declare, &quot;We must be dead.&quot;!!!).  I'm thrilled this book has been reprinted; we will definitely be hunting down other &quot;Stupids&quot; books in future.	2001-10-19

This sweet and innocent book weaves the parallel stories of two &quot;little&quot; trains, one real and one a toy.  There isn't really a story here, just the moving poem which draws parallels between the real and the toy train -- illustrated with vintage simplicity, in muted colours, by the Dillons.<br />The trains travel up hills and through tunnels, but always with their goal in mind.  The toy train's mission is just as important as the big one, and though &quot;professional&quot; reviewers have quibbled with the absence of a child pushing the toy, I see that as a plus -- when a child plays trains, he is not the engineer or a passenger, but the unseen &quot;deus ex machina.&quot;<br />I suspect this is one of those books that I enjoy more than my kids (5 and 6); they didn't quite &quot;get it&quot;, at first, and though my son is interested in trains, this book isn't really about trains in the sense that he enjoys.  Though the parallels might be lost on younger children, that age group would probably respond better to the images of trains and scenery -- real and domestic -- that are so eloquently depicted in this book.<br />ALSO...If your kids like this book, check out Burl Ives' album, &quot;A Twinkle in your Eye,&quot; which has a lovely sung/spoken version of this book's verse:<br />http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000062EA/	2001-10-19

She doesn't dish up easy plots or pat endings, and that, at least, isn't a problem.  Bittersweet is her specialty, and it's what I've come to expect.<br />However, although her stories are often unusually distanced and cool, I think this book has slid a little too close to the &quot;frigid&quot; end of the spectrum.  The main character, Rebecca, bloodlessly navigates her past and present, and readers are left watching as if through a valium-induced haze as the events of her life unfold with little comment or emotion.<br />Tyler's writing is masterful as always.  And I can't fault her for her plot, which is full of fascinating developments and achingly realistic family interactions.  Tyler paints a keen portrait of Rebecca and her entire (very!) extended family -- so vivid, in fact, that I felt frustrated, and ultimately, disappointed, that Tyler didn't let me FEEL her story as vividly as I could see and hear it.	2001-09-12

If you've read any of my other reviews (click on my name above to see them!), you'll know I don't read &quot;fluff&quot;.

This book's terse diary-entry format and its guileless, often-clueless heroine reminded me of an Adrian Mole book more than anything else -- only all grown up (and yes, I KNOW there are &quot;adult&quot; Adrian Mole books, but I didn't enjoy them...!).<br />Life can get pretty depressing on a steady diet of &quot;literary&quot; fiction and non-fiction. Sometimes, I need a break, and a book like this is the perfect opportunity to immerse myself in pure reading enjoyment. Since reading &quot;Edge of Reason,&quot; I have reserved the first Bridget Jones book from my local library, and am waiting on the edge of my seat for (hopefully!?) the THIRD installment in Bridget's madcap adventures.	2001-09-12

Something tells me Wisniewski wrote and illustrated this book out of sheer love of the classic Jewish folktale of the Golem, a man made of mud. Certainly, it's not written in a typical &quot;kiddie book&quot; style, and in Wisniewski's version (unlike some other retellings), the plot is eerily complicated by the fact that Golem doesn't want to die.<br />A cross between Superman and Frankenstein, Golem is invoked for a single purpose, and when his purpose is fulfilled, he's put to sleep (literally; he never dies in this version, but is buried in holy books in an attic). It's this aspect that I think kids might find the most disturbing. The line between &quot;bedtime&quot; and &quot;death&quot; is so narrow in childrens' perception that this book's ending may frighten them more than the somewhat low-key mayhem Golem causes in his lifetime.<br />Despite the unusually blas&eacute; retelling, this story comes to life through Wisniewski's gloriously intricate papercut illustrations -- also seen in &quot;The Secret Knowledge of Grown-Ups&quot; -- which will thrill any child in their hellish spookiness. Although my kids seemed a little perplexed by the above-their-heads text, in the end the pictures kept them riveted, thrilling to this well-known epic from the dark days of our history.	2001-09-05

Well, that's silly! You probably are going to buy more than one children's book. But the truth is, even if you own some of these books on their own already, this collection is a great &quot;take-along library,&quot; perfect for travel or curling up on the sofa.<br />Though the stories lose a little in the full-page format (stories like &quot;Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom&quot; are really meant to be read a page at a time, and the built-in &quot;suspense&quot; suffers somewhat by seeing the pages all together), the book's comprehensiveness definitely makes up for it, as does its quality.<br />This book is amazingly well-bound and will stand up to a surprising amount of wear and tear. We've had ours for two years now, and even with some fraying around the edges, I've been pleasantly surprised at how durable this jumbo paperback has been. Even more surprising, the kids keep pulling it off the shelf long after newer books have lost their appeal. They can always find new and old stories: Madeline, the Tub People, Curious George... they're all here, and more.<br />For the old favourites you've always loved and the new ones you'll wish you had as a kid, this book makes a timeless addition to any children's library.	2001-09-05

I used to be a victim of the fast food mentality, eating every other meal at a ...urban dining. Then, for religious reasons, took myself out of the loop, committing to eat kosher food, most of which I cook myself at home. I won't say I've never regretted the decision, but in this book, Schlosser gives me many more reasons I'm glad I removed myself from the \\"fast food loop\\".<br />Like a previous reviewer, I thought this book would be about ...and their ..., but he actually covers much, much more territory -- so skilfully that I didn't mind his chapter-long tangents (few of which, in the end, are actually tangential to his main argument). However, I did find I was disappointed with this book's \\"epilogue.\\" Schlosser hopes to empower his readers, charging them with the \\"you can make a difference\\" mindset. The corporations are afraid of you, he says, urging readers to use their buying power sensibly. Frankly, I felt this conclusion is weak after the sensationalistic charge the rest of the book elivers.<br />Are the big food franchises really afraid of me? I don't know. But as the years go by, I see how my decision impacts not only myself but my children, who can watch ...ads enviously, but without begging me for a trip there -- because they know there's no chance I'll give in. They're among the minority of North American children who can walk past ... without whining. I don't even know if they know his name. For those small things, at least, I'm grateful.<br />If you're looking for reasons to take yourself out of the loop, Schlosser dishes up a few compelling ones here. But chances are, you'll keep eating whatever the big conglomerates want you to, at least a couple of times a week. My own reason for not eating fast food was my decision to answer to a force more powerful than any franchise. Schlosser can't offer that kind of motivation, but this book might go a long way towards convincing you to think twice before chowing down.	2001-08-27

This has been called the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; of Judaism, and it certainly is that. A little skimpy on halacha (Jewish law) and day-to-day practicalities, this book is all about having a good time, making a difference, saving the world.<br />Illustrated throughout with scary 1970's black-and-white photos, cartoons, and clips of Yiddish proverbs, this book actually manages to overcome its &quot;feel-good&quot; message, providing a joyful introduction to important Jewish themes. It might be nice to see an updated edition of this book, but in the meantime, it and its siblings certainly fill a gap.<br />If nothing else, the &quot;Jewish Catalog&quot; books capture an era in Jewish thought, informed by the youth movement, when havdalah was hip because you could use incense, and Jewish music was anything Jews felt like singing together. We may mock it now, but maybe we could use a little of that enthusiasm today.	2001-08-27

In this book, the parallels and rivalries between &quot;Jewish&quot; and &quot;American&quot; are brought to the fore both in the political and economic setting of Postville, Iowa and in Bloom's own life as an assimilated Jew.<br />It might be tempting to dismiss &quot;Postville&quot; as one more hostile attack on Orthodoxy by a non-observant Jew, a disturbing trend in recent (Jewish) media. But Bloom manages to mostly keep his book from deteriorating to that level. He rarely stoops to rhetoric, choosing to let the facts speak for themselves. I have no doubt that he's editing the facts to support his story, but that's the task of any decent journalist.<br />If he allows the Postville Lubavitchers to hang themselves with their &quot;anti-everyone else&quot; sentiments, they've certainly provided him with enough fodder to do so. And as for the inevitable questions about whether Jews ought to air &quot;dirty laundry&quot; for a non-Jewish reading public, Bloom is honest enough about his motivations, and shares enough of himself, poignantly depicting the clash between his suspicion of the &quot;very Jewish Jews&quot; of Postville and the kinship he (at times) desparately wants to feel with them. It's clear from his personal angle that he's not writing merely for sensationalism.<br />This book doesn't offer concrete closure, either in terms of the Postville situation or Bloom's own life. Politically, the &quot;native&quot; Iowans vote against the Jews, but they stay anyway (despite having threatened to leave). The palpable tension still hangs in the air, but nobody's backing down. As for Bloom, at the end of the book, he's left with a Hebrew name and a Jewish son and little awareness of where he needs to go with either one. Alienated from the Postville Jews by his unwillingness to become Orthodox, and alienated even more from his superficial cultural Judaism by the physical distance to New York, Bloom's situation in the end mirrors that of many American Jews. The fact that he's able to write about it eloquently -- though he may not be able to draw any immediate conclusions -- makes this book worthwhile reading for Jews in the heartland, and anyone else who hopes to understand the current exile.that he's able to write about it eloquently -- though he may not be able to draw any immediate conclusions -- makes this book worthwhile reading for Jews in the heartland, and anyone else who hopes to understand the current exile.	2001-08-27

There are some religious themes thrown in here, but I found these less significant in Eliza's journey than Goldberg seems to have intended them to be.<br />However, the book was marred for me most by its predictable, almost trite, ending.  I might have forgiven it had there been less build-up (in other words, if it had been a short story).  But instead, Goldberg drew her narrative out to an almost agonizing extent, tossing in lengthy passages about Eliza's brother Aaron's journey into the heart of a Hari Krishna group.  This is Eliza's story, and I would have liked it more if the focus had stayed on her.<br />But that wouldn't have been enough for a novel, which apparently, is what Goldberg was determined to write.  Despite this, I am definitely impressed with her talent, and her strong, evocative style.  I look forward to seeing more from Goldberg as her story-weaving skills grow.	2001-08-22

[Audiobook Review only]<br />The gravelly-voiced White has never been one to mince words or present a &quot;disney-fied&quot; view of life even in his kids' stories. His characters are real, their problems gritty and even his talking swans, spiders, pigs and mice are faithfully true to real life -- not the slick, &quot;animated&quot; version of life most kiddie authors dish out.<br />Trumpet of the Swan is no exception; parents who have long enjoyed the book form of this classic will love the extra zest White's flat (yet mysteriously expressive) drawl adds to the narrative. As in his writing, White speaks his story as if he really believed it, as if he really loved it, as if the uncertain fate of one plucky swan has meaning for every one of us, which -- of course -- it does.<br />Even the most cynical modern kids will enjoy sharing Sam's adventures, and the sheer length of this recording makes it an excellent travelling companion on long trips. On our recent vacation, we listened to it all the way out to the Canadian Rockies and back, and the kids (5 and 6) were content throughout.<br />As with White's other children's books, older kids and adults will get a kick out of many references (like Sam's slightly sleazy &quot;agent&quot;) that little kids might not catch, making this a hit for the entire family. This audiobook is a bargain at any price. Don't leave home without it!	2001-08-14

She sheds the usual anthropologist's garb of objectivity, admitting from the start that she is passionate about her subject, and the work is stronger for it.<br />However, I eventually got annoyed that there were no illustrations provided to help the reader along (it may be just the Canadian edition that suffers from this tragic flaw).  As visual as her language is, this book proves the maxim that a picture is worth 1000 words.  Those thousand words can be as beautiful as they like, but sometimes, dummies like me need a picture as well.<br />Reading about the spectacular details of St Agnes' church, I got more and more frustrated.  Visser presents each column, each section of ceiling and floor, each mosaic tile, with such loving detail that I needed to examine them -- but lacking the plane fare to Rome, that's a nearly-impossible dream.  Flipping from her descriptions of columns to the front cover hoping to catch a glimpse of them was eventually too much for me, and I returned this book to the library unfinished (this almost never happens).<br />A book of this quality deserves glossy, full-colour illustrations.  Without the multimedia assist, you're going to find this book to be dry and tough going, even if you've enjoyed Visser's work in past.  But still... I've recently discovered that Visser has her own website with many small images from the church ...<br />Perhaps I'll print out the pictures from the website and curl up with this book again at some point.  Her language is so lovely, it may be worth another shot.	2001-08-14

This is a short book, but what is included here will definitely resonate with most non-religious thirty-somethings, GenX'ers searching for meaning in some pretty weird places. Like Schiffman, we've grown up Jewish, which makes us different, &quot;but not in the right way,&quot; and we've spent our adult lives trying to discover a version of this faith which makes sense to us.<br />Schiffman does spend a bit of time agonizing (I believe a previous reviewer called this &quot;silly whining&quot;) over not being able to find a rabbi to perform her own intermarriage. But for me, those sections only detract a little from what is basically her own inner journey. If this book had been much longer, I might have lost patience, but as it is, she manages to skilfully (and with humour!) avoid falling into the navel-gazing trap of so many &quot;search for meaning&quot; books.<br />Though my personal answers are different from Schiffman's, I do agree with her when she quotes Rabbi Jane Litman that &quot;Judaism -- even the most Orthodox Judaism -- believes in ongoing revelation.&quot; That awareness infuses the rest of Schiffman's travels throughout this fascinating little book.<br />While some may disagree with the tactics Schiffman chooses to explore her Judaism (taking on an &quot;all-trayfe diet&quot;, for instance), her sincerity shines through. She doesn't offer the easy answers some of us may be looking for, but at least she lets us know we're not alone in the search.	2001-07-03

Getting your characters up a tree, 2.  Surrounding the tree with alligators, and 3.  Getting them down from the tree.  Coupland gets all his characters up a pretty impressive tree:  basically, the end of the world as we know it.  That means that getting them down is going to take some pretty ambitious footwork.  If Coupland doesn't quite make it, this book is so lyrically written that we can't hold it against him.<br />The language he chooses to tell his story is simple; his characters are basically grown-up teenagers.  Their problems, too, are simple -- growing up, getting jobs, marrying, moving away, coming back to the old neighbourhood -- except for Karen, who spends quite a bit of time in a coma before waking to (briefly) rejoin them.  For all its simplicity, though, this book is marvellously, intricately human.<br />The ending Coupland has chosen is the only likeable, humane way down from the tree; he does it with humour, laughing at himself and his characters all the way to the finish line.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a while and laugh right along with him.<br />It's rare to find young storytellers this gifted, writers who do more than just muck about in the shallow angst of their sophomoric young lives.  We should definitely support them when we can, lest we spawn a generation of the most depressing literature humanity has seen to date.<br />(this review is in honour of Canada Day; buy Canuck!!!)	2001-07-03

I had no delusion that we Jews would get a fair shake in LaHaye's and Jenkins' best-sellers, but I wanted to see just how bad it was.  I came away shaking my head in shame that I am living and working alongside actual people who actually believe this....<br />A major theme in the book is the conversion of the 144,000 Jews apparently predicted in the book of Revelations.  In other words, the authors' dream is for us to realize that our whole religion has been wrong for 2000 years.  All the Jewish stuff going on, like the rebuilding of the Temple, is depicted as a stepping stone for the book's true \\"Christians\\" to trample on their way to heaven.<br />I put the word \\"Christian\\" in quotation marks because as much as LaHaye and Jenkins would love to believe that their book is going to win souls to their cause, even mainstream Christian readers will probably just come away chuckling at all the predictable literalist, Fundamentalist touches that mar this admittedly exciting science-fiction book.<br />The authors are clearly of the impression that by calling all alcohol \\"booze\\" they can sound real casual-like; almost as if they'd tasted the stuff themselves.  You get the impression that they'd call anything \\"booze\\" -- light beer, Kahlua, a nice Merlot, Communion wine.  Booze, all of it.<br />Same with anything having to do with sex.  All the good women have disappeared, of course.  While the men left behind are basically nice guys who didn't happen to get saved in time, the women (including Steele's own daugher, at first), are basically harlots.  Is it just coincidence that Hattie, a loose, bosomy cliche of a stewardess and one of only two major female characters, quickly becomes an accomplice to Nicolae Carpathia, a/k/a the anti-Christ?<br />There's a lot of fun plot-driven stuff here, if you have the patience to wade through this book's anti-woman, anti-Jewish, anti-anyone-else sentiments.  That's a big IF....<br />Luckily, I've learned for myself that Christianity is neither as small-minded nor as simplistic as LaHaye and Jenkins make it out to be.  There's a right way and a wrong way to win followers to your beliefs and despite strong sales, I'm confident that the Left Behind series is the perfect example of the wrong way.nts.

But they're not totally brainless. Instead, they reflect Gen-X culture and attitudes, taking important issues like globalization seriously but having fun with them at the same time.<br />I love the Toronto-isms sprinkled throughout this book; not so many that it's overbearingly regional -- just enough to give it character.

Surprisingly, though, there was none of that here.  Instead, this book tells the heartfelt story of Hammer's quest to understand not only his brother but his own Jewish spiritual leanings.<br />There are no cheap epiphanies in this book:  Hammer doesn't come away a &quot;convert&quot;, and neither can he bring his brother Tuvia back from the edge of extremism where even his wife Ahuvah feels he may get hurt.  Rather, they find common ground:  with hard work and compromise on both sides, they manage to cultivate a vocabulary that bridges their two very different worlds.<br />Neither brother, it becomes clear through Hammer's sensitive narrative, is &quot;right&quot; -- but they manage to speak to each other with love and come to respect each other's journeys.<br />A book like this will certainly have many fans among those who seek to denigrate &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot; Judaism -- it is scathingly honest about the poverty and even criminal activity of a few of its adherents.  But if that's all you're looking for, you will hate this book for its honest, truthful portrayal of the beauty and excitement of traditional Jewish spirituality.<br />Though Hammer initially suspected he'd lost his brother to a cult, he comes away from his journey accepting that this IS who his brother was all along:  an extremist, perhaps, but one for whom Judaism is a good fit after all.  The conclusions of this book aren't the usual trite condemnations of one lifestyle or another, but they are satisfying and real, which makes this book's contribution truly meaningful, rather than merely sensationalistic.	2001-06-18

It took me years to figure that out, and now I'm amazed that I ever went without one.<br />The Artscroll is the single best siddur for general use.  It includes daily, Shabbat, and many holiday prayers, as well as the entire book of Psalms, weekday Torah readings, inspirational verses, along with simple instructions in English to guide you in what may be your first steps towards praying as a Jew.  While some of the sections (like the Psalms and Torah readings) are exclusively in Hebrew, in general, this is a very accessible book with lucid modern translations.<br />This book makes no apologies for its traditional leanings, but serves them well and proudly.  The prayers recall the historic Temple, sacrificial practices, our faith in God, the future messiah and the world to come.  Jews from a Conservative background will find much of the material here familiar, but for others, this siddur may offer a first introduction to these ancient values which, for centuries, have been the backbone of Jewish prayer.<br />No matter which Siddur they use in your shul, this beautiful volume is a proud addition to any Jewish home.	2001-06-13

Prager teaches that the key to &quot;happiness&quot; is not perpetual entertainment, but understanding our own values -- and making sure we choose high-quality, lasting values.<br />Does he assert that certain values are higher than others?  Sure!  But in an era when moral relativism is rapidly overtaking common sense, Prager's approach is a cool breeze in the stifling room of Political Correctness.<br />Even if I don't always agree with him -- as so many of his callers say, to his great amusement --  Prager is a clear thinker, and, illuminated by his biblical and practical perspective, this book is a much-needed discussion of the kind of happiness all of us need in our lives.	2001-06-05

Spong is probably right to assume that the early Christians would approve of his reconstruction of their Gospel message for the new era.  However, much as I admire him, I can imagine how a believing Christian might feel perplexed by this book.  As Spong picks off the founding myths of Christianity, the virgin birth, the resurrection, and so on, I might find myself asking, &quot;what would he have me believe, then?&quot;<br />For Spong, who has spent a lifetime as a theologian, it may be a simple matter to replace broken myth with meaningful Midrash.  But I can't help wondering how the Christian-on-the-street, who is not theologically sophisticated, would take to being told by a bishop (no less!) that he no longer has to believe in the things he's always taken for granted.<br />In Spong's memoir, &quot;Here I Stand,&quot; he speaks with sadness of how the press has woefully misinterpreted his teachings, presenting him as an &quot;unbelieving bishop&quot;.  Sure, the media do tend to twist things around, reducing his life's work to headlines and sound bites, and they're always looking for controversy.  But I think this is also a very telling indication of how Spong misjudges what the common Christian, even the *intelligent* common Christian, is looking for.<br />Fox Mulder of the TV show &quot;The X-Files&quot; always insisted, &quot;I *want* to believe&quot; (in his case, in UFO's and extra-terrestrial life).  This is the plea of Christians, too.  They don't want to watch theological sleight of hand -- they want a faith that will help them weather the storms of life.<br />In his memoir and elsewhere, Spong comes across as a man absolutely certain of God's redeeming goodness.  Perhaps, then, the mechanisms of how Jesus lived and died and how the Gospels were written and canonized are simply less interesting to the average person than that clear, simple truth, which I wish he'd expressed more clearly in this book.<br />As a non-Christian, I deeply enjoyed &quot;Liberating the Gospels&quot;, finding it both rigourous and easy-to-read.  But I sense that if I were Christian, it would leave me with an uneasy feeling about the current state of my religion and its future as a source of inspiration and hope.ating the Gospels&quot;, finding it both rigourous and easy-to-read.

Spong's goal here is simply to demonstrate that the Bible is not the exclusive terrain of people like the \\"Creation Scientists\\" and that a range of interpretation is not only possible, but exactly what God intended.<br />Judaism, of course, has always taught this, and even in the middle ages and further back, Jewish scholars were debating, from a biblical perspective, important contemporary issues ranging from the age of the universe to the moment human life begins.  Yet this diversity of Truth has often been lacking from Christian scholarship.<br />Of course, the Bible is important for non-Christians, too -- even the Christian Bible.  If you've always viewed the Gospels as the exclusive domain of missionaries out for our souls, Spong's work may be your gateway into a greater understanding of the Christian culture around us.	2001-06-05

The content of \\"Outline of my Lover\\", however, is not so much a novel as a collection of more-or-less plotless but poetic ruminations that are enjoyable in the way they are conjoined and juxtaposed.<br /> I was expecting a little more of a story, but what conventional plotting does take place in this novel is handled so  delicately that it is barely perceptible.  Nevertheless, Martin's  reflections on stardom are important observations of our society, where we  often live side-by-side with celebrities but rarely acknowledge them in  any human sense.<br />This book, despite its sparse tone, is a promising addition to Martin's literary career.  REM fans looking for voyeuristic detail won't find it here, but readers looking for a sensitive, thoughtful interpretation of the persistence of love will be rewarded in abundance with this novel.	2001-06-04

The characters are basically stereotypes -- the burned out producer, the former child model -- bumping up against each other in an attempt to create meaning.<br />Coupland's talent shows through here, despite the hackneyed premise of the book.  He manages to invigorate many of these old stereotypes and create a novel which does redeem itself to some extent from its iffy initial premise.  But I agree with a previous reviewer that this is NOT the best introduction to Coupland's work.<br />What he accomplishes here is a demonstration of his considerable skill, working himself into and out of corners most writers wouldn't touch.  But in the end, this book is unsatisfying, leaving me dreaming of the realistic characters he gave voice to in Shampoo Planet, Microserfs, and perhaps most strikingly, Girlfriend in a Coma.<br />Coupland may have begun the Gen-X literary revolution, but he has dropped the ball rather obviously with &quot;Miss Wyoming&quot;.  I hope he'll find his way back on track in time for his next novel, due out this fall.	2001-06-04

(this is another where I *would* give zero stars, if I could)<br />I would normally hesitate to dismiss any person's life story as having NO merit, but &quot;The Hole in the Sheet&quot; is going to be the exception.  This book confused and saddened me.  The sections of memoir are painfully authentic, but the degree of vitriol in the rest of the book is frightening.<br />  When I picked it up, I expected a scholarly work, with at least some reasoning and argumentation.  Instead, Kaye rambles on hatefully, extrapolating a vast web of all-male conspiracy from just her own upbringing within one particular Jewish family.  I mean, I'm sorry her experience was so awful -- but only the most twisted mind could really blame the world's oldest monotheism, the source of all our society's morality, for all the evils Kaye charges it with.<br />Don't forget, it is SHE, not the men of the Talmud or the Shulchan Aruch, who writes Jewish women out of the picture -- by making the assumption that our foremothers in Europe (and farther back) had no hand in forging the religion we have inherited from them.  Judaism has always been in the forefront of women's rights, though it may prioritize those rights differently from Kaye.  Women in Judaism are more than just careers; instead, Judaism honours foremost our role as bearers of life.<br />This book has become required reading for antisemites, a frightening reminder of how the eyes of the world are still on us, waiting for any sign of evil beneath the surface.  One antisemitic website refers to &quot;the Jewess Evelyn Kaye&quot; and the conclusive &quot;proof&quot; she provides of Judaism's ultimate deception.  While such lunacy may keep Kaye's book in print, I can only hope this isn't the audience she envisioned when writing her book.<br />I pray that Kaye has somehow been able to reconcile her troubled past with the genuine worth and wisdom that Judaism has been able to offer so many, and that she's found contentment in her own life.  Even that, however, cannot undo the damage this book has done.en that, however, cannot undo the damage this book has done.	2001-06-04

But after three failed attempts, and reading the rave reviews here at Amazon, I decided to give it another try.  By the time I got a couple of chapters in, I was hooked.<br />With her spicy and textured prose, Diamant paints an honest and three-dimensional heroine.  Her brothers, too, spring to life on the page:  Reuben, Simon and all the twelve tribes right on down to Joseph.<br />In this book, Diamant has managed to weave midrash with modern insights to bring her women's lives into focus.  While the men tend to fade into the background, probably some would say the Bible itself is guilty of this in reverse.<br />Some readers may object to Diamant's diverges from traditional interpretation; for instance, Dinah's rape is turned into a love affair.  But Diamant writes so knowledgeably and with such respect for existing traditions that it's difficult to fault her, especially given her clear fascination with her subject matter.<br />While it may be uncomfortable to discover in our foremother Rebecca a petty old crone, or see our other mothers practicing the fertility rites of their ancestors, there is a reverence here as well, a compassion for all these mothers and fathers who paved the way for monotheism and morality as we know it today.<br />This is an important work for Jews and non-Jews, believers and non-believers.  The Bible wasn't given in a vacuum -- it was earned by the sweat and blood of the earnest, hard-working desert nomads we meet perhaps for the first time through Diamant's novel.	2001-05-31

It's not *about* time, though time does figure into it, in the sense that Atchity will teach you how to get time on your side through mastering some very basic skills.  The secret here is getting to know your brain and familiarize yourself with all the tricks it gets up to in order to undermine you writing instinct.<br />This book is part inspiration, part how-to, part common sense and part unique insight from Atchity's experience writing, teaching and producing.  I found the section on &quot;breaking into show business&quot; least useful, while his concise exposition of the elements of fiction and drama will be useful even for writers of non-fiction who want to spice up their writing.<br />I must admit that A Writer's Time is a real mixed bag, but I won't hesitate to recommend it.  Atchity will micro-manage your writing career if you let him, from how you organize your desk to how many index cards you use to compose your first novel.  But all of those are only suggestions, and, as he says, if his suggestions don't work for you, toss them out.<br />But even if you disregard his suggestions, hang onto this book, if only for its enthusiasm -- it's hard to come by from veterans in this business.  As Atchity says, &quot;Writing is a craft.  A craft not only can be learned, it MUST be learned.&quot;<br />In every paragraph, his confidence shines through that not only can you do it, but that you will.  Atchity is no ra-ra cheerleader -- he knows what he's talking about.  He's created many successful writers before, and he wants to help the magic work for you.

I enjoyed this book and I'd highly recommend it -- it's become the &quot;classic&quot; modern Orthodox text on the status of women, and it was very &quot;formative&quot; for me in my own religious growth.  Greenberg, as I've said before, loves Judaism, and takes seriously both its challenges and the forces of modernity.<br />However, I found that her chapter on &quot;The Issue of Abortion&quot; was a little forced.  Surprisingly, I *agree* with some of her conclusions, but I disagree with her premise that we can be less reverent about issues of life and death in the modern age.  Greenberg suggests that because children used to die in infancy and early childhood, large families were essential, but now, with longer lives almost guaranteed, we can kill off babies in utero.  That piece of the puzzle just doesn't fit for me.<br />Apart from this one chapter, which seems to depart from her usual rigour when dealing with matters of tradition, this is an excellent response to many &quot;women's issues&quot; -- most of which, like divorce, are really issues BOTH genders need to evaluate in a good, honest light.<br />A previous reviewer has said she ought to re-release this book, and I agree.  Much has changed, politically and in Jewish religious spheres, since the first edition of Women and Judaism, and I'd love to see how Greenberg's views have evolved over the years.	2001-05-17

From the history of margarine to the ubiquity of corn, there's just so much we don't know about the way we live our lives.  And so much we take for granted, too:  the order we eat our meal, the table manners we will use, the salt we casually sprinkle without wondering about its provenance.  Visser's writing is light and cheerful as she tosses out fact after fact on these and many other subjects.<br />This book has no real central thesis; Visser has no agenda here.  Though she presents many potentially-dismaying facts (such as the extinction of several varieties of produce), she's not a doomsayer.  She never goes too far in any potentially-negative direction.  But in this context, I think she's made the right decision, never branching off into polemic or getting up on a soapbox, even for a second.<br />I'm not saying those issues aren't important.  They're just not central to what Visser wants to write, so although she overlooks them somewhat.  Instead, she stays on topic throughout, delivering what almost every author promises but many can't deliver:  a thoroughly enjoyable read.	2001-05-17

And for Lerner, that's the ending she dreams of every single time she picks up a manuscript.<br />What a reassuring guide this is to the often-&quot;bedaffling&quot; world of publishing!  Lerner has been there and back and lived to tell the tale... and it's a tale we unpublished authors are eager to lick up.  She dishes out all the tasty stuff, showing us the hard truth about what editors are really thinking as they pick up our manuscripts from the slushpile.<br />Her overview of &quot;writerly personality types&quot; is amusing but a little superfluous.  Anyway, there's probably a little of each type in every writer.  We're cocky, we're ambivalent, we're junkies... all rolled into one.  It's a pity this section is right up front, because I was reading this book to find out about editors.<br />But anyway, as she says right out, this ultimately isn't a book on writers, or on how to write.  Editors are people too, Lerner says, showing (not telling!) how she helps &quot;her&quot; writers.  Editors (and agents) like Lerner want to be partners in creating quality books, and she's right to say they're the often-unsung heroes of the industry.

From the &quot;zogerin&quot;, the women's prayer leader to Misha the midwife dispensing her various potions to induce a pregnancy or get rid of one, the mythical town of Blaszka comes alive through the voices of its women. Although at times the story is a little uneven, with tidbits inserted that seem to have no relation to the plot (one of the women has an affair with a gentleman in Warsaw that seems as though it's excerpted from another book altogether), Nattel draws out her story in a fascinating, almost midrashic way, layering interpretation upon interpretation until, gradually, the whole picture emerges.<br />Perhaps the greatest flaw in this book is Nattel's attempts to weave a magical theme into the book, for example in the characters of &quot;the Traveller&quot; and &quot;the Director&quot; (and with one of the main characters being able to turn herself into a tree frog). These insertions, too, are a little annoying, and overall, they are too subtle to make any meaningful point. Luckily, they manage not to detract from Nattel's lively and evocative shtetl tale, so different from some others we've seen and heard.<br />Let's just say that Blaszka isn't Anatevka, the mythical town seen in the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, with its clean (if slightly dusty) streets and its cheerful, sexless cast. Blaszka's women and men are lusty and three-dimensional; they menstruate, they ejaculate. And Blaszka itself is muddy and strewn with filth and ruins.<br />In her notes at the end of the book, Nattel writes that in her research, she tried to avoid historical records from after WW2 because of the rosy-coloured nostalgia for pre-war Jewish life, and there is certainly no sentimentality here.  Yet, with all her honesty and truth to life, a certain beauty emerges in her depiction.<br />Out of the filth and mud and bickering of small-town Poland, Nattel weaves an enduring legacy to the next generations of Jews -- a tapestry-like vision of the world of our grandmothers. The River Midnight is a stunning first novel from an outstanding Canadian writer, but it is something more as well -- a window into a home to which we will never again return.<br />I should also add that this novel made for excellent (lively!) book-group discussion. My mother invited me along to hers, and there were many varied responses (from &quot;I loved it&quot; to &quot;I hated it&quot;), but nobody could remain neutral in the face of this strongly evocative work.

As another reviewer commented, the passages about the death of his first wife show sweetly (but not sickeningly!), that in leaving the priesthood, Crossan began the proceess of becoming more fully human.<br />For Crossan, reconstructing himself was part of the task of reconstructing Jesus, for it is in Jesus' full humanity that he finds the deepest roots of his faith.  As a Jew, I can't connect with that belief on a theological level, but as a person of faith, I found Crossan's search, both for himself and for the Jesus he was never introduced to in seminary, to be moving in the most profound way.<br />Though his story might have been more sensationalistic if he'd &quot;lost his faith&quot; and gone on to condemn Christianity, Crossan has taken the nobler path and revitalized Christian thought in the process.<br />This memoir is an excellent springboard to his other, more theological works, creating a context for his beliefs and presenting a portrait of the kind of sympathetic teacher every religion needs.	2001-05-01

I came to this book eagerly as an on-again-off-again &quot;baalas teshuvah&quot; myself.  There are many books on the market about Jews becoming more religious, and many of these offer fascinating new insights.  I was really hoping Hendler would have something to say that would resonate for me... but just a short way into the book, I realized I was going to be disappointed.<br />I'm sure Hendler is a lovely person, but on paper, I found her rather self-absorbed.  She seems obsessed with her family's wealth, status and influence in the Jewish community, and while I'm heartened to see the &quot;elite&quot; showing an interest in genuine Jewish life, I couldn't help resenting the touch of sanctimoniousness I detected here.<br />I am also leery of anyone who claims to have &quot;gotten religion&quot; within the Conservative movement.  My own past experience with Conservative Judaism has biased me here, but I think returning to your religious roots demands that you surround yourself with like-minded individuals.  Frankly, I doubt there's any Conservative congregation on the continent where Shabbat, Kashrut and Taharat Hamishpacha are practiced in anything like a majority of homes.<br />I remember all too well walking home from a Conservative shul and having other congregants beep at me from their cars as they drove past.  That was just one more symptom of the underlying disdain within the laypeople of that movement for accepting halachic responsibility in their lives.<br />I'm pleased that Hendler has taken on some of that responsibility, and that she's found joy and fulfillment in the process.  However, I doubt that her message will resonate with most Conservative Jews, who are probably quite comfortable with their current lack of observance.  What Hendler seems to have discovered is that while philanthropy alone isn't enough to elevate herself above the masses, halachic life might be.<br />In &quot;getting religion&quot;, Hendler has joined a different type of elite, one that exists only within the Conservative movement.  In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, laypeople are often well-educated, services include more English, and there is a greater focus on making religion accessible.  In Orthodoxy, the majority of participants are observant, and can lead traditional services and Torah readings in Hebrew.  Only in Conservative Judaism is there a rift between the layperson and the &quot;priesthood&quot;, the rabbis and chazzanim who drape themselves in robes and silly hats so they can stand above their congregants at the front of the synagogue.<br />Hendler's &quot;odyssey&quot; (as another reviewer here called it) is really the tale of how she bought her way into that priesthood, acquiring everything but the long black robes through a pampered suburban journey into spiritual life.  Though she contends that anyone can incorporate Judaism into his/her life, I doubt that's really what she's after, because then she wouldn't be (as the same reviewer commented), such a &quot;sought-after lay speaker.&quot;<br />She is sought-after because her thesis is that Torah-inspired Judaism isn't such a &quot;dirty&quot; concept after all... even the rich can do it!  But I for one resent that kind of help, with its insinuation that there is something improper about religious life, that it needs the &quot;hechsher&quot; (imprimatur) of wealth and a good upbringing to make it palatable.<br />In true Conservative fashion, Hendler's book ultimately touts Jewish life only as a means to personal fulfillment, rather than as a system of ancient responsibilities which are often as difficult and confounding as they are uplifting.  Though she describes the difficulties of observance, her descriptions are often superficial and breezy, much like the title of this book.  To me, both epitomize the Conservative obsession with being religious, but not TOO religious, that eventually drove me away from that movement altogether.<br />Another reviewer commends Hendler for her patience, but at many points in this book, that could be interpreted as restraint and a less-than-wholehearted desire to make the major life changes Judaism demands.<br />Read this book for its anecdotes and reminiscences, but don't expect any kind of epiphany.  There isn't a lot of &quot;take away&quot; wisdom in this self-obsessed work.  Hendler does provide a reading list, and the story of her journey might make a good starting point for Conservative Jews who want to stay that way.  But there are better autobiographies to read for inspiration if you're interested in embarking on a full, open-minded Jewish journey.dler for her patience, but at many points in this book, that could be interpreted as restraint and a less-than-wholehearted desire to make the major life changes Judaism demands.  <br />Read this book for its anecdotes and reminiscences, but don't expect any kind of epiphany.

Sometimes, enough is enough.  This book was going along well enough until all of a sudden, Icy &quot;gets saved&quot; and it's all downhill from there.<br />It's like she embraces Jesus, finds her voice and her life goes from hellish and weird to peachy-keen in the span of about two pages and a chapter break.<br />Now, it's true, I've heard remarkable stories from Oliver Sacks and others about people with Tourette's who take comfort from music or religion, who find it helps them control their urges, at least in public.  But somehow, I didn't need this kind of &quot;wrap-it-all-up&quot; ending to Icy's story.  A happy ending, sure.  Finding herself, sure.  Even finding Jesus; sure.<br />But it's like at the last minute Rubio decided to sugar-coat the characters she'd previously drawn so vividly in all their sometimes-ugly Appalachian detail.  I'd rather have stuck with those REAL characters right through 'till the end than wound up with the artificial caricatures she'd transformed them into by the end of the book.	2001-04-19

In fact, as stupid as it may have been, I kept reading, all the way through to the end.<br />There's so much bizarre stuff happening, at a rate of maybe fifteen &quot;oddities&quot; per page -- a grandmother who smells of roses, an incident at the mikveh, a handicapped American girl in Israel -- it's just impossible to stop reading.  You're too desperate to find out what happens next, even if the events aren't strung together with anything resembling a conventional plot.<br />Forget everything you ever learned about literature.  The framing story here is weak and the notion of the family &quot;curse&quot; is poorly drawn; there is little or no believability, even for a magical story such as this one.  It doesn't make sense -- but it works.<br />I found the text a little awkward in places (avoiding contractions where they might have been appropriate, etc), but generally, you forget you're reading a translation and just immerse yourself in the experience of this story.

She read this book wanting to know where King &quot;gets his ideas,&quot; and came away shaking her head that she hadn't been instantly transformed into a bestselling novelist.  Well, duh.<br />In &quot;On Writing,&quot; King tells us all that stuff about his life not just because it's fascinating (just as interesting as any of his novels, on a small, human scale), but to drive home the message of the second half of the book.  That section grows from the first into a treatise on becoming a brilliant novelist through sheer dedication and hard work, something that reviewer probably knows very little about if she's still looking for easy answers.<br />King has no magic formula to offer readers hoping to become the next...well... Stephen King.  But he's clearly dedicated to teaching by example, and his is a noble example indeed.  The sections on his returning to work after his near-fatal injury were both grisly in their detail and inspiring in their message of hope and strength.<br />King &quot;gets his ideas&quot; using the simple &quot;What if?&quot; formula that any decent writer turns to, whether their fiction is realistic, surrealistic, or anywhere in between.  It's what he does with the ideas once he's found them that sets him apart from the crowd.<br />This book is a fascinating peek behind the scenes for anyone who writes, or even anyone who reads.  The words on the pages don't just fall from heaven... King's memoir proves that, more likely, they've been dripped straight from the veins of hard-working blue collar authors who really care about their craft.	2001-04-18

With haunting illustrations by Jon Muth and sensitive, spiritual text, written on a level kids can easily understand and relate to, Gershon's Monster is a gorgeous book for Rosh Hashanah or any other day of the year.<br />While Kimmel relates his simple classic tale, Muth takes us on a panoramic journey through the old country, his &quot;camera&quot; swooping around to depict the characters' life from every possible angle.<br />My only problem with the book is that Gershon is depicted wearing a &quot;tallis kattan&quot;, the fringed undergarment any religious Jew would have worn, but this garment hasn't been drawn accurately.  Muth depicts it with SIX fringes instead of FOUR.  He draws it, throughout the book, with the proper two corners in the back, but with FOUR in the front, so it looks like a scarf dangling down from beneath his vest (it looks kind of like the thin blue talleisim worn in some shuls).<br />This was a jarring inaccuracy, especially considering that the text of the book and the explanatory notes at the end were apparently run past several rabbis for approval.  Perhaps Muth should've had them look at the pictures as well.<br />Visualizing our past misdeeds as a &quot;monster&quot; is a perfect way for kids to come to an understanding of the Jewish concept of teshuvah (return, repentance); and an awareness that sweeping away our sins isn't enough.  The simplicity of this tale belies its message, which is one we as adults ought to learn as well.  Despite the single visual flaw, this is definitely a keeper... and a great High Holiday gift item for the Jewish kids on your list!	2001-03-29

Tee hee!	This book is both funny and honest, and I must say, I am a sucker for funny and honest.  The story here is compelling:  outcast gay dads adopt baby from outcast street urchin, and everybody walks away more or less happy.  Right?<br />But this book is also a treatise, promoting a definition of &quot;family&quot; that includes any self-defined combination of adults and children.  And yes, I know there are many incompetent straight parents, and many loving gay individuals who could be parents.  Oh, and I know that gay men are no more likely than straight men to be pedophiles.  But a baby is a baby, and it deserves the best chance it can get.<br />Adoption agencies bend over backwards to place babies in unstable situations, so as not to offend anybody.  Even single people can get a baby if they try hard enough, so gay couples should take it as no compliment that they too can adopt.  The attitude is &quot;your choices are as good as my choices&quot;, so anything goes.  Does anybody notice that this is all about ADULTS demanding what THEY want... not what their kids might NEED???<br />In one disturbing section, Savage is bemused over a class dealing with the &quot;grief&quot; phase most adoptive couples go through following the realization that they can't have a baby.  Since he and his boyfriend knew all along there was no biological route that would bring them children, Savage suggests that a class on grieving is evidence of straight bias.<br />Sure, us &quot;breeders&quot; take our fertility for granted sometimes.  But there's a big difference between an infertile straight couple and an &quot;infertile&quot; gay couple.  Savage believes he has the right to swoop into the procreative world -- condescending to attend a few breeder-biased classes -- pick a baby, and swoop back out again.  I shudder to think that a man who's &quot;infertile by choice&quot; has the right to adopt a baby that could have gone to a married couple with no other way to reproduce.<br />And yes, I did say married couple.  The permanence thing really does matter when you're talking about raising kids; &quot;committed&quot; relationships just don't do it.  Savage's boyfriend sounds like a brat; immature and self-centred.  Sure, he loves the baby, but his absorption doesn't extend to the rest of the little family Savage would like to pretend they've just created.<br />I do know that many straight couples break up and many gay couples stay together forever.  It's not PC to point out that the straight couple still has the better odds, but there you go.  Sure, 50% of marriages end in divorce, but for first marriages, the odds are more like 67% (down only 3% from the early 1900's).  Straight couples stay married.  Gay couples rarely stay together.  It may be a stereotype, but it's also true.<br />So what's my final take on this book?  Is having &quot;two gay dads&quot; going to harm a baby?  Savage certainly sounds like any loving dad.  But are gay parents able to give a child everything a straight (married) couple could?  He hasn't convinced me, despite some genuinely touching moments.  I had to chuckle when, nerves on edge, Savage attacks a cafeteria cashier for selling bagels of many foreign varieties, including bacon bagels, which he ironically notes &quot;observant Jews couldn't even eat.&quot;  His honesty was touching; we're all a little crazy sometimes.<br />Full of personal insights like this, Savage's book is an excellent chronicle of the adoption process, both the technicalities and the emotions involved.  And he really does prove that the emotions are probably the same the world over, regardless of sexual orientation.  Gay couples feel the same things as straight couples when it comes to adoption.  But it's not about feelings, and it's not about how he and his boyfriend happen to feel, or what they WANT.  The only person who really matters is the baby, and Savage's fluffy &quot;but I waaaaant one!&quot; take on childbearing is, in the end, more than a little tough to swallow.little tough to swallow.	2001-03-28

Stein's style is delightful, and his reflections on the journey to a conscientious moral lifestyle are a joy to read.  But throughout the last few chapters, I began to realize that he'd only briefly touched on the subject of his own religion -- and that was to say that he wasn't practicing it.<br />Is it enough to have morality without religion?  Other &quot;conservative&quot; writers like Dennis Prager and Laura Schlessinger have said it is not, and I'm afraid that I have to agree.<br />Without religion, conservative morality is still perhaps better than liberalism, but it's essentially an empty thing which neither sets an example for others nor propagates to the next generation.<br />I felt sadder, after that realization, as I read on and observed that Stein's morality is propped up often by little more than his and his wife's personal preferences.  He is opposed to abortion, but why?  Without God, without absolute standards of morality for the entire human race, it comes down to moral relativism, however tough Stein may sound on the outside.<br />As Prager and Joseph Telushkin wrote in the chapter on God's existence in their book &quot;The Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism&quot;: &quot;Without God, all we can have are opinions about morality, but our opinions about &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; behavior are no more valid or binding than our opinions about &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; ice cream. &quot;<br />All Stein has, in the end, are opinions about morality, which is too bad.  He's just as Jewish as Prager, Telushkin and even Schlessinger are, but he's chosen to throw that part of himself away.  Instead, he gives us this book which tries to prove that his opinion is the pragmatic one, the sensible one, the logical one.<br />Morality, though, is more than mere logic.  If foetuses have no soul -- no essential connection to God -- abortion might well be a *logical* thing to do.  And last I checked, nobody had elected Harry Stein the supreme arbiter of Good and Evil.  I'd rather read opinions that appeal to a higher power than those of a man who seems to answer to no-one beyond himself.e arbiter of Good and Evil.

I cracked open this book having already read a previous reviewer's comments that Dr. Nielsen was running away from her messy divorce, and that her journey was motivated by the kind of midlife crisis that leads men her age to invest their life savings in red Ferraris.<br />So I have to admit, I prejudged Dr. Nielsen, and her book as well.  I was reading it carefully to see if she could gain back the credibility she lost for me before I even picked up the book.  The answer, for me, was a rather uneven &quot;maybe&quot;.<br />Dr. Nielsen tries to invoke the reader's sympathies, writing of her pain at being separated from her kids.  But the circumstances of her divorce are left intentionally fuzzy, and I found that disturbing.  She probably wishes to protect her kids' privacy (and her own), but we are meant to come away believing she is in the right.  In that, she only partially succeeds.<br />It's hard to believe, in this day and age, that anyone would get away with the cruelty she ascribes to her ex.  I found myself wondering, if he's so disturbed, how he won in the first place.  And sure, her lawyers advised her that there was little she could do... but I can't help thinking I wouldn't have taken that advice, if I were in her shoes.<br />But it's easy to judge from a distance, and by and large, this story isn't a pity-party.  Instead, it's a celebration of one woman's resolve to live the rest of her life despite the pain she has been through.<br />The story is riveting... she describes the dangers involved in Antarctic life and then brings us along to live them with her as they play out in her day-to-day &quot;winterover&quot; experience.  As an adventure story alone, this book is fascinating... and with the added drama of her long-distance battle with breast cancer, this becomes a uniquely &quot;womanly&quot; adventure story.<br />This book is well-written, with a nice mix of medical information, and personal reflection on her life crisis.  I did find the long detailed transcriptions of e-mails to her oncologist a trifle self-indulgent.  Dr. Nielsen asks over and over again what her odds were, as if just by knowing, she can save herself.  But almost any doctor would do the same in her situation; they're trained to take control or at the very least, understand all the variables.<br />So although I'm left with lingering questions of Dr. Nielsen's credibility -- was this journey the right thing for her to do in the first place, I'm forced to admit that this book is a moving look at how one woman gracefully fought adversity -- and won.<br />You'll probably have to take her word for it about her marriage and divorce, but beyond that, her realism makes the story absolutely believable and thrilling.etailed transcriptions of e-mails to her oncologist a trifle self-indulgent.

There was a lot of potential here, but this book could have been more than it turned out to be.<br />I read this book hoping to find something more than the usual &quot;visiting Japan&quot; travelogue.  I was hoping to find out what it was like for Horn, as an Israeli and a Jew, to live in Japan, but that's exactly what she denies readers for most of the book.<br />The way it's been organized, the book is divided into two distinct sections, and the first section, unfortunately, gives mostly the kind of rambling overview of Japanese culture that you might expect from any travel writer.<br />From the well-known (the Japanese obsession with business cards) to the cute (the Japanese obsession with toilets) to the obscure and sometimes jarring (the Japanese obsession with abortion), Horn writes capably, but deals out few surprises and little by way of her own perspective on the issues.<br />Perhaps these essays filled a niche for Hebrew speakers, with little access to the wealth of material already available in English for Japan-philes, but as an English speaker, I felt like I'd read most of what she was saying before.<br />Just when I was getting fed up, though, I found the second &quot;half&quot; of the book (significantly shorter).  Here, Horn really gets going; it's like we're meeting her for the first time.  She writes about what it's like to be an Israeli diplomat and Hebrew teacher in a country where, though Israelis and Judaism are often revered, the Nazi alliance hasn't faded from memory and antisemitism is making an unsettling comeback.<br />Perhaps the book would have been more of an even read if she'd spaced out these more personal essays, rather than clumping them together into a ghetto of their own.  As it is, the first section isn't astonishing, and the second half, unfortunately, just seems like too little, too late.	2001-02-15

But don't be duped into thinking he's done all the work for you.<br />Believe me, this ain't a &quot;Cliff's notes&quot; version of the harder books on mythology -- it's the Reader's Digest version.  Nothing wrong with that, as long as you know what you're getting.<br />As a previous reviewer noted, Frey is too limiting in his definitions of who the protagonist and antagonist can be in your story (he overlooks completely the fact that an antagonist need not be a person at all -- it could be the weather, or a giant whale, or an entire town, among other things).<br />Also, many of Frey's plot and character suggestions are too dramatic, and would have no place in literary fiction, where readers demand a greater degree of subtlety.  But if you're looking to write rollicking adventure stories, and you want to see how other authors have used mythology to create a firm, workable structure for their stories, this book may be the right place to start.<br />I wouldn't stop there, though.  If you want to write works of any depth or meaning, it would be better to move on -- if Frey manages to pique your interest in the power of myth rather than just turning you off -- to the harder, but more insightful stuff than Frey offers in this limited book.	2001-02-15

Please, don't Spam me or low-rate this review just because you think I'm dissing this guy.  I don't doubt that he's a martyr or a hero or anything else that people here have said.  I just think there's a little sloppiness about this book that undermines its very urgent, very important, message.<br />YES, McWilliams makes some marvellous points.<br />YES, the idea of consensual &quot;crimes&quot; is clearly ridiculous, when you look at it in the light of day.<br />BUT... did he have to use so many words to do it in?<br />McWilliams makes some excellent points in this book, but he does so in such a verbose, condescending and at times even &quot;cutesy&quot; way, as if to say &quot;aren't I clever?&quot;  His style becomes off-putting after only a couple hundred pages.  :-)<br />One senses that this book could have used a bit more editing, because there are so many places where he could have streamlined it, without losing any of its valuable content, and perhaps gaining some less-exasperated readers along the way.  As a writer, forced to go over my words again and again to make them efficient (for my readers' sake), I have less patience for those who aren't so considerate.<br />So, again, I reiterate:  this IS an important book.  But it could have been executed in a more workmanlike fashion.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm going to duck now to escape the torrent of rotten tomatoes!	2001-02-08

I mean, really, REALLY hard.  Jane Hamilton takes on the most difficult kinds of subjects, and she really does try to get them across without melodrama, keeping them within the (albeit Oprah-esque) world of everyday life.<br />(Speaking of which, I wonder if all you need to do is mention Oprah in your novel to get her to recommend it?  :-))<br />If you feel like this book is manipulating you, though, it's probably because Ms Hamilton tries TOO hard.  She painstakingly sets us up for Alice's fall, providing us with convenient reminiscences about how she's been a &quot;bad girl&quot; in the past.  I got the feeling an editor told Ms Hamilton somewhere along the way that these characters are too nice.<br />The book reads like she's toned the characters down a little, make them more human.  But by grudgingly showing us the underbelly of the Goodwins' placid farm life, with a couple of cranky preschoolers and the kind of everyday distractions any mother would recognize, she also seems to say that therein are the seeds of the family's destruction.<br />She left me wondering early in the book how this cast of mostly-saintly characters -- who've had a couple of grumpy days -- could possibly deserve the fate that befalls them.  What's the message we're to take away?  That a parent isn't even allowed to screw up once?  That Fate could swoop down on anybody at any time?<br />This book slides down the slippery slope, painfully close to melodrama, but is held back just barely, with great and loving effort.  This novel shows its seams just a little too clearly, peeking out from beneath a beautifully crafted story.<br />Its earnestness makes this book difficult reading at times.  Yet it's easy to see why Oprah and others are raving over it, dealing as it does with such scary subject matter.  Reality isn't like this, my instincts tell me, but my mind, and my fingers, kept me flipping through the pages anyway.  Go figure.	2001-01-28

Only John Irving could pull this off, drawing the connections clearly and lucicly and more than any other author could, making us care.<br />Yes, they made a movie with the same name, and yes, the movie was remarkably true to the book.  Yet the movie contained only about 1% of the plot and the depth of the novel.  Irving tells so many different stories here, but these stories are not about Homer Wells or Dr. Larch or any of the other characters he depicts.  If we look deeply enough, we realize that the real story here is actually our own.<br />We all come across rules in our everyday lives, and most of us follow them unquestioningly.  But Irving seems to say in this novel that rules are not always where the truest wisdom is to be found; they can even be a &quot;civilized&quot; form of evil.  He exhorts the reader to determine what is evil and eliminate it -- to throw away our preconceptions and look at many difficult issues anew.<br />Irving tackles all of this with his usual grace, good humour, and in this case, also, with extensive and accurate medical and historical research.  This is an epic, thicker than the usual novel, but it's taken me years of regular re-reading to fully digest this novel... if indeed, I actually have yet.<br />If you don't like Irving, you won't like this one, either.  But if you've never sampled his work, this is as good a place to start as any.  It's not endearing, but it was never meant to be.  It's a heartfelt statement not only about the way the world is, but how it should be.	2001-01-28

Everybody knows about Jewish confidence:  &quot;We're smart!  We're chosen!  We have more Nobel prizes than we deserve!  We're a light unto the nations!&quot;  Those are the things we say out loud.<br />But, like everybody, Jews are also insecure.  Among ourselves, we ask, &quot;Are we really smart?  Why does nobody like us?&quot;  And the deeper, more difficult question, &quot;What's going to happen to us?&quot;<br />Humour has always been the Jewish way of looking at these insecurities in the fresh and optimistic light a smile can shed on any painful issue.  From the days of the Talmud right on up to Adam Sandler (and hopefully *beyond* -- I'd hate to think of the &quot;Hanukkah song&quot; as the &quot;end-all&quot; of Jewish humour!), we use humour to poke away at ourselves, examining the things that make us unique and also the issues that frighten us the most.  Sure, this book's honesty made me squirm a little, but as Socrates once said, &quot;So, nu?  From an examined life, you don't die.&quot;<br />Telushkin has masterfully grouped the best Jewish jokes into categories.  His illuminations are helpful but never intrusive -- this is above all else a FUNNY book.  If you're wondering what makes us tick and why the funny bone is so often the way to a Jewish heart, check out Telushkin's book and be prepared to squirm a little -- and learn a lot.	2001-01-22

I enjoyed David Bader's &quot;How to be an Extremely Reform&quot; Jew.  However, I found this, his second take on contemporary Jewish culture, to be insipid and ultimately meaningless.<br />Beyond the first few chuckles, I can't help feeling that these haikus are geared towards a fading generation and constipated stereotypes that have been &quot;done&quot; to death:  the lavish bar mitzvah, the ambitious Jewish mother.<br />Maybe I'm asking too much of a humour book.  Maybe I should just grin and walk away.  But the classics, by authors like Leo Rosten (The Joys of Yiddish) and Joseph Telushkin (Jewish Humor : What the Best Jewish Jokes Say About the Jews) -- and even Bader's first book -- all prove that when Jews read humour, we do it to learn more about ourselves.<br />Humour offers a painless lesson in Jewish reality, which is sometimes troubling and unpleasant in real life.  Haikus for Jews, on the other hand, offers little fresh insight, treading a well-worn path younger Jews are increasingly reluctant to follow.	2001-01-22

She could have approached it with the bitterest revenge motives, or perhaps just a willingness to &quot;cash in&quot; on her insider's edge.  But don't worry; she doesn't.<br />Instead, she relies on candid interviews with women who are currently part of that world, rather than on her own fading and admittedly subjective memories.<br />One reviewer suggests that Distant Sisters &quot;waffles&quot; between sociological study and memoir.  Actually, this book accomplishes both, with an admirable even-handedness belying Rotem's charedi past (and future; her son did not &quot;leave the fold&quot; with her).  The distinction between &quot;academic&quot; and &quot;personal&quot; is perhaps more of a male distinction, and as a woman, I find that Rotem's mix of intellectual and emotional elements creates a fuller, more satisfying book.<br />Her observations about Jewish religious life were keen throughout.  She led me to examine more closely the tenets of my own (much more moderate) lifestyle of Jewish observance and the many religious families in my community.  Yes, it's sometimes depressing.  But even those who reject traditional observance will emerge from this book with a clearer understanding of the observant mindset.	2001-01-22

Yes, I believe that Christianity not only MUST change, but that it IS changing...<br />However, I disagree strongly with the title of this book.  I realize that Spong himself didn't choose it (his publishers changed the name of all but one of his books), but his name on the cover endorses it all the same.<br />The notion that mainstream Christianity is &quot;dying&quot; is belied not only by the fundamentalist factions Spong opposes but by the many Roman Catholics in America who insist that they are still believers -- however much they disagree with their church's teachings on such issues as birth control.<br />These are not &quot;believers in exile,&quot; as Spong's title suggests, but rather the believers who would be most receptive to his message if the title was not so immediately offputting.<br />Don't get me wrong here.  Spong has much of value to say, if you can get past the title.  But although belligerence may sell copies, it does not appeal to the psyche of the Christian who is already committed and sincerely searching for answers.<br />Spong's new understanding is not only for those who reject the &quot;old&quot; one; it's for those who seek reconciliation as well.  This book is an important EXTENSION of classic Christian wisdom, but in no way supplants it.<br />There's a song my mother used to sing:  &quot;Make new friends, but keep the old... one is silver, the other gold.&quot;  You'd be pretty dumb to put your grandmother's gold jewellery out with the trash just because you've read Spong's book.  Rather, I believe his truer purpose is to ADD to believers' Christian heritage without subtracting its unique and distinctive essence.	2001-01-22

Bryson at his worst is still better than most of us at our lampshade-headed best.  This book, like his others, was definitely laugh-out-loud-on-the-subway funny.  But I did find here that this book suffered from a few inconsistencies I haven't noticed elsewhere, particularly when he tackles serious subjects.<br />Dave Barry has proven his mastery time and again by approaching these difficult issues with dignity, somehow managing not to alienate the readers who look to him for humour.  Bryson, on the other hand, sometimes seems a little too desperate for our laugh, like an adult who persistently tickles glum children under the chin to get them to smile.<br />Nevertheless, Bryson's true character shines through.  All these pieces reflect admirably his love of family and values (and his committment to walk instead of drive whenever possible!).<br />I would have loved to have read these pieces in their original British form, but I still enjoyed them immensely as they're presented here.  His anthropological approach to American culture may jar those who feel that the U.S. is the centre of the universe, but his goal is never just to educate.  I'm convinced he simply wants us to wet ourselves laughing, and believe me, he just about accomplishes this every single time.	2001-01-22

What's a &quot;Tanach&quot;?<br />If you're just getting started in Judaism, it's easy to get bogged down with terminology.  There are lots of books on each of these subjects, but very few that cover ALL the classic Jewish sources.<br />This book provides an excellent introduction, not only to WHAT the texts are, but HOW they are used and studied.  Holtz takes us on a step by step journey through a sample section of each text, demonstrating, in a beginner-friendly way, the ways that scholars derive modern meaning from ancient wisdom.<br />Holtz never condescends -- he makes the rare assumption that the reader is highly intelligent, well-read in other areas and has become interested in learning more about Judaism.  Very much recommended before delving deeper into any one Jewish text.	2001-01-18

It's amazing how everything Wiesel touches turns to gold, and here, he's done it again.<br />The Chassidic masters Wiesel portrays were passionate about Judaism in a way any modern reader can relate to.  Wiesel deftly brings that message home time and time again, evoking not only the syrupy nostalgia of most volumes of &quot;Rebbe stories&quot;, but also a very immediate committment to Jewish life.<br />A masterpiece, this would also make an excellent gift for anyone interested in Jewish spirituality.	2001-01-18

But Heilman makes the mistake of veering a little too closely to that world without first resolving to create an honest, respectful portrait.<br />Much of what he says in this book is true, but the beauty of the chareidi lifestyle shines through almost *despite* Heilman at times.  Now, I'm not looking at them through rosy-coloured glasses either; I realize there are many problems between the chareidim and others, and that chareidim are frequently intolerant.  But Heilman's perspective is often little more enlightened than theirs is, and too often, he ends up depicting them as lazy, ignorant (in the area of elementary-school geography, for instance) or misogynist.<br />Real life is not as simple as Heilman would perhaps like it to be.  So when complexities arise, he just looks the other way and writes it the way he imagines it must be.  This may make for gripping anthropology, but it is no way to capture the spiritual reality of an entire culture.	2001-01-16

Yes, it takes audacity to live in a place for only two years and then start calling it &quot;yours.&quot;  Drainie admits that from the start, and then happily explains the uniqueness of this city that causes visitors to claim it as their own.<br />As an observant Jew, I was wary of Drainie's approach from the start.  She went to Israel as a non-Jew, covering up the fact that her mother was Jewish.  Otherwise, as she correctly suggests, religious Jews would lay claim to her through matrilineal descent as one of the &quot;clan.&quot;<br />Nevertheless, she does discover some of the spirit of Judaism, while also objectively exploring the other religious traditions uneasily cohabiting in Israel.  Her stance towards the Palestinians is the kind of common-sense approach we need to hear more of, and surprisingly enlighting in terms of the current situation.<br />Regardless of whether Drainie's Jerusalem sounds like your Jerusalem, this city belongs to all of us, and her book is a clear-eyed vision both of what Jerusalem is and perhaps what it should be.	2001-01-16

The premise here is NOT that the Gospels are &quot;flawed&quot; but that they are -- to use the marvellous analogy of John Shelby Spong, a &quot;midrash&quot;.  In the classic Jewish sense, a midrash is a story created around Biblical text to evoke a particular religious impression.  The truth or lack thereof of a midrash is less important than the spiritual impression it leaves on its reader.<br />Whether or not Jesus literally spoke certain sayings and parables, Spong might tell us, is less important than the impressions of God's love that Christians believe he revealed.  Andrew Greeley has written on the parables that their primary intention is to show us how insanely God is in love with all His people.  I can agree with a sentiment like that, and probably, so would a Jesus Project scholar.<br />However, those impressions are precisely what is lacking from &quot;The Five Gospels&quot;.  Instead, they focus on the literal text -- which is the least interesting, least significant part of the Gospels.  In that sense, this book opens up an unnecessary vulnerability for liberal Christianity.  Conservatives are ever-ready to charge that liberal Christians somehow believe &quot;less&quot; than they do, and this book offers little evidence otherwise.<br />Of course, liberal scholars of all religions know that whether or not a myth is literally TRUE is less interesting than the value that myth adds to the religion.  But Funk et al have made little effort to make that point here, perhaps to the greater detriment of their cause.<br />So, yes, this book is a valuable addition to any Christian library.  The authors approach their subject matter with faith and the bravery to examine even their most sacred myths.  But it's difficult, in this context, for their faith to show through amidst their line-by-line dissection of the text.  There is scholarship here, indeed, but, in the end, precious little Christianity.	2001-01-10

If you take Novakovich's suggestions seriously, keeping all the exercise goals in mind, you ought to have more than a few marvellous creations of your own by the time you're done.<br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was a lengthy inclusion of a story of his own.  It is somewhat enlightening, but takes up too much space for what is gained, in my opinion.<br />You'll need motivation to get through this book, but Novakovich makes it easy, building on previous exercises to craft original, imaginative finished and semi-finished fiction pieces.  And the feeling of accomplishment when you emerge at the end of the book is well worth the purchase price and the work you put into completing it.	2001-01-09

Reform Jews may charge that Greenberg leans too far towards Orthodoxy, and Orthodox Jews (like one reviewer here) may insist that she's too liberal to be called Orthodox.

I disagree that this is a book for Orthodox converts only:  it is for anyone who seeks to become a *serious* Jew.<br />Some have commented that this book is hopelessly biased towards Orthodoxy.  This is an expression of Lamm's desire to deal honestly with painful and potentially divisive issues.  Yes, some movements will tell you you don't have to know (or do) all of this to become Jewish.  But if you're serious about becoming a Jew, only Lamm's book will help you not only learn *about* this religion, but also try it on for size.<br />Some movements will hide the details from you, give you an &quot;easy&quot; way in.  If that's the Judaism you want, you will find it an easy, but not very rewarding, path.  Lamm gently gives you all the hard AND heartwarming stuff, in this single thick volume.<br />Rules and regulations are not necessarily a bad thing -- they can make the path clearer and easier to follow.  Would-be converts are often put off by demands that they keep kosher or observe Shabbat -- &quot;Why should I, if I already FEEL Jewish?&quot;  But you couldn't become a U.S. citizen, either, just by saying you already &quot;feel American.&quot;  You've got to know what all of it means first, and that's what Lamm gives you here.<br />In this book, Lamm expertly balances his halachic (legal) perspective with stories of actual converts and a realistic view of issues that Jews-by-choice may be facing.  If you're serious about Judaism, you owe it to yourself to find out -- in all its gory detail -- what this religion is actually all about.	2001-01-09

For anyone who's attended a Passover Seder, it will seem familiar -- it's kind of like a Haggadah for the Shabbat meal.<br />I wouldn't recommend buying this on its own, but most people who begin having Shabbat meals will sooner or later want to share the experience with others.  This book is priced low enough that you can buy a few copies and put them out for guests or newcomers to your own Shabbat table.<br />Like Wolfson's other book, the booklet version includes Hebrew text, English translations, and &quot;transliterations&quot; -- phonetic text of all blessings and prayers, so those who do not yet read Hebrew can follow allow.

We've all done it -- gotten pressured into situations which compromise our value systems, given in to the unreasonable demands of bosses, spouses, friends or relatives.  This book will show you how it happens, and more importantly, how to stop giving in.<br />From her clinical experience, Forward shows us plenty of situations of what she has come to call &quot;emotional blackmail&quot; and many of these will probably mirror your own experience or that of someone close to you.  Many times reading this book, I found myself shaking my head, trying to get rid of that nagging feeling that &quot;I knew these people.&quot;<br />My only criticism of this book is that with few exceptions, blackmailers are described as such, and they can come across sounding like monsters.  Forward spends a little time exploring their motivations and insecurities, and she does point out that often we can turn into blackmailers ourselves, but perhaps not enough.<br />By and large, she speaks only to &quot;blackmailees,&quot; and this book certainly makes them feel good about themselves, perhaps at the cost of dehumanizing the blackmailer.<br />As long as you can keep in mind, though, that this book aims to build constructive dialogue and not to destroy your connection with the blackmailers in your life, it is a most valuable tool to reasserting your own needs in any relationship.	2001-01-08

Its only limitation is that it's not about Shabbat observance as a whole.  It covers only the first part of the day, the Friday evening meal.<br />(The book suggests that it's part of a series called &quot;The Art of Jewish Living&quot;, but I haven't heard of any other books in the series...)<br />So this book isn't the be-all-and-end-all, but it does what it sets out to do with admirable readability and interest.

I can forgive him for going on Howard Stern, becoming famous as Michael Jackson's rabbi... in fact, I can forgive him almost everything, just for this marvellously affirming book.<br />In Kosher Sex, Boteach lucidly makes his point that, rather than condemn human sexuality, Judaism has traditionally viewed it as the &quot;express lane&quot; to marital contentment.<br />Boteach has apparently taken it upon himself to repackage the intricate Jewish laws on sexual conduct for the masses, and he has done so astonishingly well.  A little short on humility, perhaps, but we knew that already about Boteach's sensationalism and media courtship.<br />This book is by no means a comprehensive guide to the halacha (Jewish law) pertaining to sexuality.

I'm all in favour of re-interpreting Catholicism, but Wilkes' presentation is stultifying and tired.  He obviously thinks he's offering radical new insights, but I much prefer the treatment of these subjects by Catholics like Andrew Greeley who appeal, not only to sentiment, but to theology and church history as well.  Having enjoyed &quot;And They Shall Be Your People,&quot; his profile of a rabbi and his congregation, I know Wilkes can do better.<br />In this book, he focuses on individual Catholics' experiences (including his own), rather than on formal theologies, with highly unprofessional results.  Wilkes' own experiences and beliefs slant the book immensely, and the quotations almost all support his own opinions of what Catholicism should be.  Those opinions are rarely supported, and there is little opportunity to hear dissenting voices.<br />Wilkes' conclusion -- rather dully reiterated in each chapter -- seems to be that almost anything is &quot;good enough,&quot; as long as the individual's conscience isn't troubled.  I have a hard time believing that any religion -- particularly one with a solid core of religious *law* -- can be distilled to that essence.<br />Wilkes has picked up on the necessity of guiding the perplexed, but, in this book, he has done too little guiding, and perhaps too much perplexing, shedding murkiness and confusion rather than clarity.	2001-01-03

I love Nuland's writing, and could spend hours meandering through his explanations of medical phenomena.  But this particular book was either poorly conceived or shoddily edited, because I found it much more difficult to get through than his usual lively mix of clinical experience and academic background.<br />There's just no balance here.  That usually-delightful mix is completely absent, traded in for clumps of one or the other.  He'll give a couple of tantalizingly tabloid case histories, some personal information about his own medical training, then chapters and chapters of academic detail.  It just doesn't work for me.<br />Still fascinating as a glimpse of where medical thought is coming from, and as usual, Nuland is brilliant at pointing out the vestiges of old ideas and anachronisms even within modern medicine.  But as the title suggests, this really is a surgeon &quot;reflecting,&quot; with seemingly no particular direction, intention, or goal.<br />Too bad, though, because there's a lot of fascinating potential here.	2001-01-03

I really loved Writing Down the Bones and Wild Mind, and I like this newest Natalie Goldberg book, too.  But something's changed, and the subtitle her publishers have used (&quot;Cracking Open the Writer's Craft&quot;) is misleading, to say the least.<br />One of my favourite things about Goldberg's writing, especially in Writing Down the Bones, was the way she -- unlike most authors on writing -- refused to either mince or waste words.<br />In that book, her approach to each chapter was one of &quot;get in, make your point, get out.&quot;  When you take a Flintstones vitamin, it doesn't matter if you get Wilma or Barney, or orange or purple -- you're still getting all the vitamins and minerals you need.  Same thing with Writing Down the Bones.  Crack it open at any point, read any chapter, and you'll still come away immeasurably enriched.<br />Don't get me wrong -- I still enjoy Goldberg's writing.  But I don't get that &quot;enriched&quot; feeling from Thunder and Lightning.  She doesn't really spend as much time on &quot;the writer's craft&quot; as she does on her often rambling reminiscences.<br />If you're interested in the journey of one particular writer, this is an excellent book.  But it shouldn't be billed as a book on craft.  For that, there are better books out there, perhaps foremost among them Goldberg's own earlier work.	2001-01-03

The wisdom Wolpe offers in this gem of a book transcends Judaism, and really offers creative ways for parents of any religion to open their children's minds (and their own!) to the basic concepts of a loving God who created the world and cares about what we do and what happens to us.  It also paves the way for exploration of difficult issues like suffering and unfairness in the world.<br />Wolpe never gets preachy; rather, he suggests ways to create shared moments with your child not just to teach but to validate his or her views on religion.  A child who asks, &quot;Why did God give Moses a speech impediment?&quot; might not need an answer.  He might be waiting to tell you, as Wolpe touchingly recounts, &quot;So my sister wouldn't feel so bad&quot; (because of HER speech impediment).<br />That's the kind of God Wolpe wants kids and adults to share -- a God who cares about us and our feelings, even little girls who stutter.  His chapters are at once deeply philosophical and eminently practical.  You can tell just by reading this book that Wolpe is a man who knows kids and knows God and sees how naturally the two go hand-in-hand.<br />Of course, because there's a child in each and every one of us, there is always the possibility that this book can help US re-establish connections to the divine that we haven't felt since childhood.  And that, as they say in the credit card ads, is priceless.	2000-12-06

In the Conservative movement, rabbis are generally observant of traditional Jewish law while their congregants are often not even aware of it.  I've always figured that was a lonely and frustrating life.  Wilkes did a great job of showing me exactly how lonely and frustrating it can be.<br />Now, that may not be true for every Conservative rabbi, and Wilkes does a good job of pointing out the occasional rewards that go with the job, but in general, I'm amazed anyone would choose that kind of a vocation.<br />While other religions sometimes differentiate between clergy and laypeople (most notably Catholicism), Judaism has always taught that anything the rabbi is expected to do, his congregants are as well.  But when those congregants are otherwise committed to a busy American lifestyle, the rabbi often lands the thankless task pointing out their Jewish responsibilities.<br />In one of the most touching threads running through this intricate book, Wilkes describes the rabbi's struggle to organize a congregational trip to Israel.  The congregation has many families who are willing to come along but only -- it seems -- if their rabbi doesn't accompany them.<br />The rabbi, to his great dismay, discovers that the families don't want the rabbi along to enforce standards of Jewish observance like the Sabbath or kosher laws.  They want spirituality, sure, but on their own terms, not &quot;his.&quot;<br />This book describes with eerie precision the &quot;observance gap&quot; between clergy and laypeople in the Conservative movement that has led me -- and many other Jews -- to look for spirituality within other movements of Judaism.<br />I can't even begin to imagine the extent of the research Wilkes must have done, but he's managed to get every detail of this book exactly right... you find yourself forgetting it's not written by a Jew.<br />There are many touching moments in this book, particularly when Wilkes focuses on the rabbi's chaotic family life and the sacrifices which, he fears, will all amount to nothing.  Yet it ends on an optimistic note, leaving the reader with the possibility that it will be alright after all, for the rabbi, his family, and for all Jews, wherever they may find themselves.<br />Disturbing, yes, but eminently worthwhile for its unique insight.nd yourself forgetting it's not written by a Jew.  <br />There are many touching moments in this book, particularly when Wilkes focuses on the rabbi's chaotic family life and the sacrifices which, he fears, will all amount to nothing.

As with any good recipe, there's plenty of room for creativity, but Holmes is there to coach you along the way.<br />Of course, the price is probably on the high side, just for that one chapter.  :-) But if you can see past her sentimentalism, there are plenty of other gems in here as well.<br />I have written many articles using Holmes' formula(s), and I try to always check back with this one little chapter, just to make sure I'm on course.  Time and again, I have found it has helped me smooth out my articles' rough edges and produce polished pieces I can show off with pride.	2000-11-28

I began reading this book excitedly, despite Neusner's rather limited premise:  he sets out to argue with Jesus over whether his teachings actually stem from the Torah (Jewish Bible) or represent something completely different.<br />Neusner admits freely that he cannot debate against faith -- a person who believes in Jesus does so not only because of his compelling words.  And he admits that he does not believe in Jesus... but claims he will debate Jesus' words (as they are passed on to us in the book of Matthew) to pay him the honour of listening to his words and considering them on their merit.<br />Although, as a Jew, I accepted Neusner's initial premises easily enough, I found his argument began to drone on tediously.  His main points boil down to one or two:  the Torah teaches holiness for all of Israel; Jesus (as depicted in Matthew), on the other hand, taught eschatological (end-times) lessons concerning salvation of the individual.<br />Neusner basically ends up insisting again and again that despite Jesus' urging, he would not give up the day-to-day holiness of Judaism for end times that may or may not occur in his lifetime.  There's a little more to what he has to say than that, but it's difficult to see through his grandiose prose and excessive verbiage.<br />All in all, a worthwhile read, and definitely not your usual work of &quot;why we don't worship Jesus&quot; Jewish apologetics.  There are plenty of excellent sources for that kind of thing, and Neusner has succeeded in creating something entirely different.<br />Whether or not it's something of lasting value -- for Jews or for Christians -- is up in the air because of the inaccessibility and redundancy of his style.  Worth reading if you feel up to a good mental challenge, though... if you can tolerate his coming back to the same (very few) points over and over again.	2000-11-23

Some readers might find this book a bit of a challenge in terms of Greeley's analysis of his years of sociological data, but stick with it... out of the swirling mist of numbers emerges a fascinating study of modern religion in America.<br />Greeley's sociological sleight-of-hand manages to address (and smash) many myths about the Catholic church.  If you think belief is declining in young Catholics... if you believe they are leaving the Church in record numbers... if you think they shed their Catholic consciousness (what Greeley calls their &quot;Catholic imagination&quot;) the second they quit Sunday school ... well, you're in for a few surprises.<br />So buckle up and stick with this book... it's a wild (and inspiring) ride!	2000-11-20

There's a huge number of catechisms and books out there that will tell you how to &quot;do Catholic,&quot; but very few that capture the essence of what *being* Catholic means quite as well as this work of Greeley's does.<br />As a non-Catholic -- and very satisfied with the depth of my own religious experience -- I will probably never experience some of the phenomena Greeley describes.  But it's fascinating to plumb the depths and be given this intimate peek into how Catholicism actually FEELS to Catholics.<br />I admit, I found his thesis controversial at first:  that Catholics have a different way of looking at the world.  But without getting bogged down in specifics, he manages to define many of those distinctions from his own wealth of experience.<br />It's easy to put down another religion if you just look at the surface details.  Greeley leads all readers -- regardless of their own religious convictions -- to respect and admire his fellow believers for the uniquely Catholic outlook on and contribution to the world.	2000-11-20

I'd have been disappointed if they were absent from this, his exciting and moving memoir.<br />After finishing this book, my only wish is that this isn't the end of Father Greeley's long career of theological troublemaking.

Dr. Wells suggests that &quot;for any serious Christian who interacts with Jewish persons, this book is a must read.&quot;<br />Might I suggest that any serious Christian -- Catholic or otherwise -- take to heart the message of Nostra Aetate and most &quot;mainstream&quot; theologians ... that the best way to interact sensitively with Jews is to accept them AS Jews.<br />Loving Jews -- as evangelical Christians claim to -- but rejecting our Jewish practices and beliefs is the root of such antisemitism as gave rise to the holocaust and other episodes of Christian hatred of Jews throughout the millennia.<br />If you really love us, let us face God on our own terms, through the original covenant which -- in the words of Nostra Aetate -- &quot;God does not repent of.&quot;  Otherwise, it's not us you love, but your own perception of what we OUGHT to be.<br />I couldn't give this book zero stars, but that's what it deserves.

But I'm raising the kids as Jews, and doubt their Christian grandmother would feel comfortable telling them stories about the miracles of Jesus.<br />Perhaps the book is appropriate for couples raising their kids &quot;strongly&quot; in both religions, but I didn't feel it can really speak to the large numbers of &quot;interfaith&quot; kids who are being raised Jewish.<br />I put the word &quot;strongly&quot; in quotation marks above because the idea that both grandmothers have such strong feelings for their own religion and yet happily support the notion of a dual-faith grandchild is more than a little far-fetched.  Why doesn't the Christian grandma worry about the girl's soul?  Doesn't the Bubby ever get flustered when she's asked why she doesn't pray to Jesus?  (or why she's still waiting for the messiah?)  I think any interfaith child ought to feel insulted by the implication that her religious life is this &quot;Disney-fied&quot; -- cheerfully simplistic in a nauseatingly &quot;let's all hold hands and be friends&quot; kind of way.<br />Another off-putting factor: These two grandmothers, mysteriously, seem to be of two very different generations.  The Jewish one has just stepped out of the shtetl, while the Christian grandmother, by contrast, is cosmopolitan and peppy, &quot;hip&quot; and well-dressed.<br />I don't know if this is Ms Hawxhurst's bias or the illustrator's, but someone along the way made a conscious decision that &quot;old and fat (but cheerful) and out-of-touch&quot; were traits they wanted to use for the &quot;Bubby&quot; character.  While some might argue that a chubby grandmother figure is more comforting to kids, as a Jewish mother, I must say this an unappealing stereotype.<br />In short, this isn't the most useful book for interfaith kids unless a) you don't really like either religion very much, and b) you have the kind of perfectly harmonious family relationships usually only found in... well, in storybooks, I guess.an unappealing stereotype.<br />In short, this isn't the most useful book for interfaith kids unless a) you don't really like either religion very much, and b) you have the kind of perfectly harmonious family relationships usually only found in... well, in storybooks, I guess.	2000-10-02

And even if you are a Christian, if you have any respect for Judaism, you should probably steer clear as  well...<br />This book is designed to perpetuate the myth that the Torah and  the other books of the Tanach (the Jewish bible) are an &quot;Old&quot;  Testament, which has been supplanted by Jesus' teachings, contained in the  &quot;New&quot; Testament.<br />I feel sorry for unsuspecting Jewish parents  or grandparents who buy this book for their kids or grandkids only to  discover that it presents Judaism only in relation to Christianity, not as  a religion in itself.  (for example, it discusses Abraham in terms of how  long before Jesus he lived, and refers to the Tanach as &quot;what Jesus  would have read when he was a child.&quot;<br />Notice that the publisher has  stuck a &quot;rabbi's&quot; name on the cover, while hiding the genuine  author's name on the back cover... this is a conscious ploy to attract  Jewish customers to what is basically a Christian book.<br />I have no fight  to pick with Christianity, and if Christian parents want to teach their  kids about their Jewish roots, this is probably a fine book for them to  use.  But because of its deceptive targeting at Jewish families, I strongly  suggest that nobody -- Christian or Jew -- buy the book, as it would only  encourage the publishers in their efforts to mislead.<br />(P.S.

Kaplan does an excellent job of clarifying this distinction in his marvellously approachable book.<br />This book surprised me (pleasantly) in more than a few ways.  Science and Judaism are not diametric opposites, and  (despite the ponderous title!) this is a down-to-earth, readable source for  exciting traditional Jewish views.<br />In his essay on the age of the  universe, Kaplan points out that the insights of Jewish tradition have --  from the very beginning -- NEVER been strictly literalistic ones.<br />Kaplan  also touches on the dangers of aligning ourselves with evangelical  Protestants and others who would exchange the richness of our midrashic  heritage for a simple-minded &quot;God wrote it; I believe it&quot;  allegiance to the Biblical text.  As serious Jews (or Christians, for that  matter), we need not adopt convoluted &quot;creation science&quot; theories  or look the other way (&quot;study it because it's on the test, but ignore  it the second you step into a synagogue&quot;).<br />We need to embrace  evolution, NOT with our fingers crossed, but because it is every  conscientious scientist's best guess as to how God got us here in the first  place.  English is not the BEST language in the world, but we use it  because it's the best we have to communicate with each other.  Same with  evolution.  Not perfect by any means, but it's the closest we get to  articulating the mysteries we thank God for putting us here to ponder.	2000-06-28
