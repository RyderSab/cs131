Full of theft and dunk, smooth jumpers and fragile egos. Full of its own funky politics and stratification. Music bleeding out of old rattling speakers from open to close. Old rhythm and blues. Stevie Wonder. Aretha Franklin. Funk. Motown. Marvin Gaye. Sometimes Jimmy gets talked into hard-core rap on weekends. Or Trey sneaks in his three-year-old demo tape.<br /><br />\\"Always music.<br /><br />\\"There are fat rats that scurry through the lane on game point. Beady eyes on the man with the ball. There are roaches congregating under the bleachers.<br /><br />\\"There is so much dust on the slick floor that sometimes guys will go to stop and slide right out of the gym. Every time there's a break in the action, ten guys put palm to sole for grip.<br /><br />\\"There are a hundred different ways of talking and a thousand uses of the word motherf____r.<br /><br />\\"There are no women.<br /><br />\\"In the winter there are so many homeless bodies spread out across court two you can hardly see the floor. There are leaks when it rains. Rusted pots are set out to collect heavy drops. Sometimes a guy will track in mud and everybody throws a fit. Jimmy sets out a twenty-five-dollar heater and everybody puts their hands up to it before they play.\\"<br /><br />Court one at Lincoln Rec is the epicenter of Sticky's life in L.A. and of his dreams for the future. Lincoln Rec is a constant for him, a positive one, unlike that series of light-colored minivans that have repeatedly arrived at the group home over the years carrying foster parents who pick him up, make him big promises about a real home...promises that for various reasons always go up in smoke and leave him, once again, chillin' back at the group home.<br /><br />Court one is where he, a seventeen-year-old white boy, builds his skills playing an extremely physical style of pickup basketball with an assortment of tough, older black guys. On court one, where either you are seriously in the zone or you're spending all day with your butt in the bleachers, Sticky is determined to play and win.<br /><br />As Dante, a former pro player and a regular at Lincoln Rec explains to him, Sticky has started the \\"life being a race\\" thing \\"three stones back.\\" Not only has Sticky had to deal with the failings of his drug-addicted, prostitute mother and, later, with those repeated rejections by foster parents, but he also has \\"that mental thing, where you gotta do stupid stuff over and over and over.\\" The depictions of Sticky's frequent ritualistic behaviors, revealing his struggles with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, are agonizing. But, ironically, it is that same compulsion that keeps him so focused on constantly perfecting his skills, whether they be related to basketball or to other, less noble, pursuits.<br /><br />\\"Won't you help me girl<br /><br />Just as soon as you can?\\"<br /><br />--Al Green<br /><br />There's the bright high school girl with the beautiful green eyes, Anh-thu, who works in Miller's Outpost. Sticky meets her one day when he drops in there to steal some new pants. \\"Annie\\" seems able to see through the hard shell to the real Sticky.<br /><br />The story bounces back and forth from Lincoln Rec to scenes of Sticky's early days with his mother, the different experiences with foster families, playing J.V. hoops at school, hanging out partying with the guys, and being with Anh-thu. All together, there must be a hundred different characters we meet, and each one is unique and memorable. A number of those characters are homeless, some sleeping on cardboard on court two, others in a public toilet somewhere. Sticky's world is on the underbelly side of L.A. And regularly we get glimpses of the \\"other world\\" in the form of faceless businessmen who come walking in on their lunch break to watch what's going on and then return to their offices to tell their co-workers about the games, the fights, and, undoubtedly, about the skinny white kid with the moves.<br /><br />\\"Rob's weight is on the back of his heels on defense.

One where you could meet the public.'<br /><br />\\"I glanced quickly through the screen door. 'What about Father?'<br /><br />\\" 'I'll talk with him.'<br /><br />\\"I shrugged. 'Yeah, well, what about the others?'<br /><br />\\" 'For once let's not worry about the others,' she said. She turned back to her dishes, and her hands again moved into the soapy water as quick as trout among stones.<br /><br />\\" 'The others' takes some explaining. We were a Midwestern family long on religion. Not Lutheran, but sort of. Not Mennonite, but kind of. Not Amish, but a little bit. Not Quaker, but a good part. It was a Christian nondenominational faith, a phrase mystifying to my few school friends who were not in it ('Come on, Sutton, how can a church have no name?'). Farmwork was communal. My family shared the larger machinery--baler, grain combine, corn picker, silo-filling equipment--with several other families in the Faith. Planting, haying, threshing, silo filling, corn picking were done on an orderly circuit: VandenEides, Grundlags, Sorheims, Suttons (that was us), and so on. Unlike the Mennonites in Canada or the Amish in central Minnesota, each family owned its own farm, but the focus was on shared work, worship, and fitting in with the others.\\"<br /><br />It's 1965, and Paul Sutton has spent his first nearly-sixteen years pretty-well sheltered by life on the farm, and living among those families of the Faith. Tumultuous events elsewhere--the Civil Rights Movement, the War--seem like they're taking place in another world as heard through Paul's mom's little transistor radio. But Paul's life is about to get shaken up in a big way thanks to one of his mom's infamous \\"plans\\":<br /><br />\\" 'All right. I'm listening,' my father said, though he really wasn't.<br /><br />\\" 'First, Paul finds a job--a real job, one where he can meet the public--and then we hire someone to take up the slack here at home,' she said.<br /><br />\\"My father reached for the bread He began to butter a piece. The silence went on. Finally he said, 'First, I don't know that Paul necessarily wants to work in town. Second, who could we find to take his place? There are no hired men anymore. But third, none of it really matters, because there aren't any jobs in Hawk Bend for farm kids. Town kids have them all.'<br /><br />\\"There was silence. I looked down at my food.<br /><br />\\" 'It must be nice to be right all the time,' my mother said.<br /><br />\\"I sucked in a breath and held it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, I try my best<br /><br />To be just like I am,<br /><br />But everybody wants you<br /><br />To be just like them.\\"<br /><br />--Minnesota native, Bob Dylan (1965), \\"Maggie's Farm\\"<br /><br />Thirty or forty pages into reading FULL SERVICE, I found myself thinking back to such wonderful children's books as BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE, A YEAR DOWN YONDER, and THE CANNING SEASON. These thoughts did not spring from any belief that Will Weaver's new book is the appropriate next read for the elementary school fans of those award-winning titles.<br /><br />In fact, FULL SERVICE is a real sex, drugs, rock & roll, told-in-the-first-person, oft-rude, coming-of-age, YA novel that takes place back in '65.<br /><br />But what Kate DiCamillo, Richard Peck, and Polly Horvath did so well with those books was to create unforgettable, multigenerational, ensemble casts of characters. And in FULL SERVICE, Will Weaver accomplishes this so exquisitely that I could easily imagine him writing another book about any one of, perhaps, a dozen different members of \\"the public\\" with whom Paul Sutton comes in contact as the result of landing a job at the Shell service station in downtown Hawk Bend, Minnesota (population 1,750) over that summer that he turns sixteen.<br /><br />That list of characters begins with Paul's coworkers, Kirk and Bud. Kirk's the former high school jock with a wife, kids, and arather healthy number of bad habits, as Paul quickly learns when he takes over manning the pumps at that full-service Shell station and starts meeting \\"the public.\\"<br /><br />\\"I met a local housewife with blonde hair piled high and sprayed in place. She seemed annoyed that I came out to wait on her, and she asked for fifty cents' worth of gas. She kept looking toward the office, the back room. 'Isn't Kirk on today?' she finally asked.<br /><br />\\" 'Kirk is engaged by a service call.'<br /><br />\\" 'I'll bet he is,' she said.<br /><br />\\" 'Is there anything Bud or I might help you with?' I asked.<br /><br />\\"She gave me a long look. 'Bud--it'd be a cold day in hell. And you--not for a couple of years.'<br /><br />\\"My ears reddened like train semaphores.<br /><br />\\"Unless you know furnaces, that is,' she said, raising one eyebrow at me.<br /><br />\\" 'No, ma'am,' I stammered.<br /><br />\\" 'There's the main boiler and then there's the pilot light,' she said, gesturing, drawing a circle with her hands.<br /><br />\\"I nodded.<br /><br />\\" 'Oh, you do know furnaces after all?'<br /><br />\\" 'Well, kind of--I mean I know what a pilot light is,' I stammered. \\" 'Good. Good. A lot of men go through life never understanding the difference between a pilot light and the main boiler. My first husband, Bill, he never knew where to look. Matter of fact, he couldn't even find the basement.' \\"<br /><br />Other notable characters include the \\"hired hands\\" Paul's mom succeeds in locating and \\"The Workers\\" who are supposed to be assisting Paul in preparation for his transformation into a grown member of their religious community.<br /><br />Then those distant world events make their presence felt in Hawk Bend in the guise of a family passing through town in their VW bus on their way to joining the antiwar efforts in Berkeley, and a barber in town who lost his son in the Korean \\"conflict.\\"<br /><br />Through it all, Paul has to figure out where he stands in regards to his beliefs, his religion, and those world events, and how he fits into \\"the public.\\"<br /><br />In the long run, one of the characters we see through Paul's eyes who really surprised me is his father. The author sets him up as a rigid man of strict habit who strongly adheres to the rules of his religion, but, in contrast to stereotypes, Paul's father ends up as the rare character who really understands what being a Christian is all about.<br /><br />As with Will Weaver's previous book, CLAWS, this is not only a book that I'm anxious to recommend, it is also a book about which I'm anxious to sit down with a bunch of teens and have long discussions.Paul quickly learns when he takes over manning the pumps at that full-service Shell station and starts meeting \\"the public.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"I met a local housewife with blonde hair piled high and sprayed in place.

The song's simple lyrics eventually split into three parts that, with audience participation, becoming sort of a round that weaves in and out. It's by far my favorite song of Joanne's, and I've spent more than a decade getting seriously blissed out everytime I'm lucky enough to hear her perform/lead it.<br /><br />Joanne, who started singing as a kid on a Georgia mountaintop and ended up living out in the woods amidst us aging hippies, tree huggers, and radical feminists of Northern California, performs what has been dubbed \\"Psychedelic Folk Revival Music.\\"<br /><br />But, despite various songs about radiation on her windshield, saving salmon, and \\"earth my body, water my soul, air my breath, and fire my spirit,\\" the reality is that Joanne Rand also spends a lot of time singing stories about family.<br /><br />\\"My mama says that we are all connected<br /><br />My papa says that we are each alone<br /><br />My brother says that love is more important<br /><br />Than the roaring of the road\\"<br /><br />--The Roaring of the Road<br /><br />In fact, one of her more recent CDs is titled Family History, and through its songs Joanne tell stories of where she came from; about the great aunt who became an actress in New York City; about her grandfather's old house that was demolished to make way for a five-lane highway; of old Auntie Maud who tried driving herself from Florida to California until she \\"got confused in Texas,\\" and got stuck in an old-folks home for the rest of her life. \\"Don't forget your family, they are what becomes you,\\" sings Joanne.<br /><br />Back when Joanne's daughter Georgia was born, I gave her a copy of one of my all-time favorite picture books, David McPhail's MOLE MUSIC.

Going back six generations, to her great-grandma Soonie's great-grandma, Woodson, with the help of Talbott, colorfully portrays the joy of marriages and new generations, the sorrow of forced separations during slave days, and the courage handed down from Jacqueline's ancestors who participated in the escape of slaves by sewing pieces of quilts that were actually \\"show ways,\\" fabric maps that utilized symbols to show escapees the way to freedom. Even after slavery ended, Jacqueline's great-grandmother Soonie continued the tradition of sewing Show Ways. Two generations later, Woodson's own mother, Ann, and Ann's twin sister Caroline, each had a Show Way patch from their grandmother Soonie pinned in their dresses when, at age seven, they went \\"walking in a line to change the laws that kept black people and white people living separate.\\"<br /><br />Woodson makes It is clear that the true stories passed down through these succeeding generations have inspired her and helped provide a map for her own life's work.<br /><br />\\"And when I was seven,<br /><br />I didn't have to work in a field<br /><br />or walk in any Freedom lines.<br /><br />But I still read like Georgiana and wrote like Ann,<br /><br />and when the words were slow in coming,<br /><br />I sewed stars and moons and roads<br /><br />into quilts and curtains and clothes because Mama said,<br /><br />All the stuff that happened before you were born<br /><br />is your own kind of Show Way.<br /><br />\\"There's a road, girl,my mama said.

He presents the reader with the contemporary clash of free enterprise versus global ecological issues. He has a lot to say between the lines about parenting, and he has some great insights into the methods of dealing with bullies.<br /><br />\\"I've never read his adult books, but I sure hope Hiaasen writes more books for kids. HOOT is one heck of a first step into the world of children's literature.\\"<br /><br />So I was, of course, ecstatic that both the 2003 Newbery committee and 2003 Best Books for Young Adults committee recognized HOOT.<br /><br />I was somewhat less thrilled about having to wait three long years for the pleasure of reading a second children's book by Hiaasen. And while FLUSH is a completely different story, everything that delighted me three years ago about reading HOOT is equally applicable to FLUSH.<br /><br />\\"The deputy told me to empty my pockets: two quarters, a penny, a stick of bubble gum, and a roll of grip tape for my skateboard. It was pitiful.<br /><br />\\" 'Go on inside. He's waiting for you,' the deputy said.<br /><br />\\"My dad was sitting alone at a bare metal table. He looked pretty good, all things considered. He wasn't even handcuffed.<br /><br />\\" 'Happy Father's Day,' I said.<br /><br />\\"He stood up and gave me a hug. 'Thanks, Noah,' he said.\\"<br /><br />So begins FLUSH, the story of what happens after Paine Underwood pulls the plug on the Coral Queen and willingly gets arrested for doing so.<br /><br />The Coral Queen is a three-tiered casino boat owned by Dusty Muleman. Dusty has been making a killing off of the boat's operations because he worked a deal with the local Native Americans to park the boat in a marina on their lands, give them a cut of the take and, thus, avoid having to take the customers a few miles offshore to gamble like all the other casino boat operators are required to do. What Noah's dad is so hot about is that he is sure that the raw sewage periodically washing up on Thunder Beach is the result of the Coral Queen's holding tanks being emptied illegally into the water.<br /><br />A 60 Minutes piece about the author that was broadcast last month, \\"Florida: 'A Paradise of Scandals' \\"[...] introduces Hiaasen:<br /><br />\\"In a little less than a century, the state of Florida has been transformed from a largely uninhabited swamp to the fourth-largest state in the union. And no one has written about that transformation more successfully than Carl Hiaasen.<br /><br />\\"Part humorist, part muckraker, his satirical novels about greed, crime and corruption in the Sunshine State have become fixtures on the best-seller list and embraced by influential literary critics who compare him to Mark Twain and H.L. Mencken.<br /><br />\\"He is also an award-winning children?s author and a former investigative reporter-turned-columnist for the Miami Herald.<br /><br />\\"And he has made a career of documenting, analyzing and interpreting what may be the most bizarre state in the union -- and one, Hiaasen says, is 'a victim of its own geography.' \\"<br /><br />In the 60 Minutes interview Hiaasen talked about how being out on the water in his skiff is like church for him. In that regard, reading FLUSH feels like you are peering in even closer at the heart of Carl Hiaasen.<br /><br />When I discussed HOOT three years ago, I mentioned that it contained humor, a bit of sadness, and a touch of suspense. All three qualities are once again present in FLUSH. So are the wildly quirky characters, from the bully (Jasper Muleman Jr.), to the brute (Luno), to the buxom blonde (Shelly), the bum (Lice Peeking), the bumbling attorney (Mr. Shine), and the mysterious pirate.<br /><br />Carl Hiaasen is a master at storytelling. That he has utilized his superb talents to once again write a satirical novel about greed, crime and corruption in the Sunshine State for children (and me) is cause for celebration.<br /><br />Thanks, Carl!a satirical novel about greed, crime and corruption in the Sunshine State for children (and me) is cause for celebration.  <br /> <br />Thanks, Carl!  <br /> <br />	2005-10-02

His face was as expressionless as tree bark.<br /><br />\\"The slaves did not see the blood on the boy's back nor hear the flies droning around the red gaping wounds. They were staring at a picture in their minds, a picture of water as soft and cool as a lullaby. They did not know how the Old African was able to make them see water as blue as freedom, but he had done it to them often.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sometimes I feel<br /><br />Like a motherless child<br /><br />Sometimes I feel<br /><br />Like a motherless child<br /><br />A long way<br /><br />From my home, yeah<br /><br />Yeah<br /><br />Sing<br /><br />Freedom<br /><br />Freedom<br /><br />Freedom\\"<br /><br />--Richie Havens' rewrite of \\"Motherless Child\\"<br /><br />I got to attend a Richie Havens performance thirty-five years ago, in 1970. For many of today's young adults, 1970 is ancient history. For me, 1970 was high school and girls and protesting Vietnam, Workingman's Dead, and the first Earth Day. I learned to drive in 1970. The thirty-five years that have passed since then is the same interval of time that separated women getting the right to vote and me getting born. The Nineteenth Amendment once felt like ancient textbook history to me. Not anymore.<br /><br />\\"It happened so quickly. One minute he had been asleep, one arm across Ola's back. The next there were screams and yells and shouts, and then men bursting into his home and grabbing him and Ola, tying their hands behind their backs and pushing them outside.<br /><br />\\"Quickly he was separated from Ola. A rope was tied around his waist and then tied to the bound wrists of a man in front of him as his own bound wrists were tied to a rope around the waist of the man behind him.\\"<br /><br />Textbooks and run-of-the-mill history lessons can so easily make the kidnapping, torture, and enslavement of Africans seem like something two-dimensional that happened in history just this side of Columbus discovering the world was round. In contrast, the raw emotion of Julius Lester's text and of Jerry Pinkney's visual artistry in THE OLD AFRICAN give the slave's journey an immediacy that no textbook could ever match.<br /><br />In a work of imagination based upon a true story, THE OLD AFRICAN tells the tale of the slave once known as Jaja, God's gift, who is silent but who has The Power.

The captives were made to lie on their right sides, their bodies curled against each other like spoons resting in a drawer. Jaja could feel the head of the man behind lying on his back, the man's knees resting in the crooks of Jaja's knees just as Jaja's head lay on the back of the man in front of him, his knees and thighs tucked in the crook of the other man's legs.<br /><br />\\"Jaja lay in the middle tier, which he found out quickly was the worst place to be. Even though there were round windows that brought in air from the water, and open hatches in the ceiling let in more air, it was not enough for the almost 250 men, women, and children who lay as tightly against eachother as feathers on a bird's wings.<br /><br />\\"Almost immediately Jaja was covered with sweat, as was the man who lay against him, as was the man he lay against, as were the bodies of every man, woman, and child lying there.

Parked on a comfortable bench, I cracked open what seems to be a pretty fun YA \\"guy read\\" that I could possibly be writing about in the near future. I'd just begun the second section of the book, at which point the main character is rhapsodizing about morning and brewing coffee for the caffeine addicts. Then the father is knocking on a door, trying to awaken the main character's big brother. In that moment of reading, during which the father is beginning to raise his voice, I felt myself starting to noticeably tense in anticipation that the dad was going to fully detonate. Here it comes again, I thought.<br /><br />That's when I realized that I was actually still dealing with memories of a DIFFERENT dad, the dad from E.R. Frank's new book, WRECKED, and that I needed to process how I had been so affected by the painful story of Anna Lawson, her older brother Jack, Anna's friend Ellen, and Jack's girlfriend Cameron Polk.<br /><br />\\" 'Jack,' I said. 'I'm not trying to be mean or anything.' I took a sip of ginger ale. He waited. 'But...why do you think Cameron went out with you in the first place?'<br /><br />\\"He sighed and looked out the newly opened window. I knew what he was seeing: a telephone wire, that big maple tree, and the streetlight. He started humming.<br /><br />\\" 'What?' I wasn't trying to be rude. I was really wondering about it.<br /><br />\\"Jack stopped humming. 'Nothing.' He shrugged. 'But you are really superficial.'<br /><br />\\"I felt my face get hot. 'What's that supposed to mean?'<br /><br />\\" 'Listen,' he said. 'You just implied that there's something about me that is lesser than Cameron.' I opened my mouth to argue, but he kept talking. 'That's what I mean. You think about things that aren't important. Like who's got more status than the other person.' I started feeling nauseous again. 'And you make your decisions about that based on things like clothes and friends and where people sit in the lunchroom and who people hang out with. And if people aren't just like you, you think they're not worthy and that nobody else who matters to you thinks they're worthy. And so you write those people off.' I thought I might throw up. 'I remember when you weren't like that. I remember when you cared about things that mattered and when you weren't always sizing everything and everyone up all the time. And I liked you a lot then.' He stayed where he was, leaning against my dresser, butt on the floor, knees up.<br /><br />\\"He wasn't giving me that disgusted look. He didn't have that disgusted tone of voice. He was really talking to me. Trying to tell me something.\\"<br /><br />Anna's life is about to change. Attending an unsupervised party with friends, Anna downs some booze and then spends some time trying to sober up before she suddenly realizes she's missed her volatile father's curfew. Driving herself and Ellen home, the world turns upside down in an instant, complete with Bono singing the chorus of \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" on the disembodied car radio, and a screaming from outside the car that suddenly ends. The driver of the other car in the head-on collision, we learn, is Cameron Polk.<br /><br />Anna's long psychological recovery from the fatal accident provides the setting for an unsettling examination of a family that was already riding on the edge of disaster prior to the crash. And when we repeatedly probe the family history, frequently instigated as a result of one of Anna's bloodcurdling nightmares, we find that the past offers a lot more gray than it does black or white.<br /><br />The fact that there also ends up being some gray areas in terms of the accident makes this aspect of the Lawson family story that much stronger a vehicle for contemplation, discussion, and debate, especially among adolescents who have just, or are about to, get their driver's licenses.<br /><br />How much of your mind is on your driving? A study being publicized the other day concludes that (in the words of Newsday) \\"Driving and yakking on a cell phone increase fourfold your chances of ending the trip in an emergency room.\\" It can certainly be asked both of newbie and veteran drivers: \\"What levels of concentration, attention, and sobriety does it take to ensure that you are being a responsible driver, a defensive driver, a guilt-free driver? How is your driving being affected by alcohol, cell phones, headphones, mochas, Big Macs, flirting, fighting, or whatever the hell is going on while you're piloting that mass of metal at high velocity?<br /><br />\\"And my brother's bedroom door slams, and I'm left on the other side, small and alone and not knowing what to do, and Frances is handing me her tissue box, and I feel it like waves, just waves of despair washing over me, and I cry and cry and cry, and my bones are soggy, and then I see Jack's head flat on the table, next to his laptop, and broken glass strewn across the living-room floor, and broken glass and flashlights glittering underneath the dangling earth, and the earth turns into soil, and then a blade of grass grows up out of the soil, and it's joined by other blades, and then there are brown leaves and fingers picking them up one by one, Jack's fingers picking up the leaves, and then his face looking at me, his face saying, If you had just stayed home and picked up the leaves, maybe none of it would have happened...\\"<br /><br />I'd hope that many adolescents (and even more so, their parents) recognize that if Anna's dad had been someone she could trust and count on then she could have either called him for a ride or gotten permission to sit tight and not get on the road in the first place. That dad is one piece of work, but YA author and Manhattan psychotherapist E.R. Frank does a superb job of showing us many facets of this man with serious problems.<br /><br />That she can call us anytime without fear of repercussion is certainly the message Shari and I will again share with our own soon-to-be driver, along with a recommendation that she check out this latest piece of powerful writing by E.R. Frank about a family in crisis.<br /><br />And turn off your cell phone, damn it!!!driver's licenses.  <br /> <br />How much of your mind is on your driving?

An estimated 11 million American children take Ritalin and many others exhibit ADD, ADHD, or other learning disabilities. Over 83 million Americans take Prozac, Zoloft and other medications for depression or other psychological conditions, including seasonal affective disorder and sexual addiction. More directly related to politics, environmental toxins such as lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, or manganese can damage the brain and increase risks of criminal violence and other behavioral problems. These empirical observations are relevant to public policies in education, criminal justice, or health care, and indicate the need to reconsider theories of human and social political behavior.

Masters, Department of Government, Dartmouth College.<br /><br />\\"My parents went to get Troy in our SUV. It was a Saturday and they left early in the morning. It would take them till about noon to make it to the prison, and I figured they would be home with Troy before nightfall.<br /><br />\\"I didn't go. I didn't need to make an excuse or offer an explanation--I just said that I wasn't going, and they didn't press me.<br /><br />\\"I figured I would see him soon enough.<br /><br />From our front porch, I watched my parents walk across our front lawn toward our blue SUV. My mom was all decked out for the reunion in a yellow dress, pumps, and carefully applied makeup. I wondered if while she had been applying her eyeliner and lipstick, she had been conscious of the fact that she was on her way to a state penitentiary.<br /><br />\\"My poor mother. When she reached the SUV's door, she turned and waved to me once, and there was such tension in the simple gesture that I wanted to go give her a hug and beg her to stay here with me, and not subject herself to this ordeal. My mom is a tall woman, just an inch or two shorter than my dad. She's had a problem with nervous tension over the past few years, and she's on medication to help her stay calm.<br /><br />\\"I could tell by looking at her eyes that she hadn't slept a wink the previous night. I wondered how many pills she had taken that morning.\\"<br /><br />Seventeen year-old Jeff Hastings used to live in Upstate New York with his parents and his big brother Troy. But the family was totally ostracized by their community--and Jeff seriously beaten up--after Troy was arrested, tried as an adult, and convicted of plunging a seven inch knife into a classmate. Troy received a life sentence for the crime.<br /><br />The family has made a new start in a small town amid the New Jersey pine barrens. Jeff has a beautiful girlfriend Beth, lots of friends on the soccer team where he's a backup wing, and the reputation for being a good guy.<br /><br />But after five years in prison Troy is being released on a technicality and coming back to live with his family. Jeff is convinced Troy's coming to Pineville will ruin Jeff's life a second time. More importantly, Jeff is sure Troy is evil and dangerous.<br /><br />\\"Had Troy really changed? Do bad people become good through penance and reflection? I sat there on the corner of the bed and watched the afternoon give way to evening, as the branches from the crab apple seemed to twist longer and longer in the fading light, and I couldn't help doubting it. I knew Troy. For years he was my big brother, my closest friend, my teacher. I had learned from him, and then, even as a young child, I had sensed that there was something wrong with him, something missing in him, and I had gradually turned against him. By the time he was arrested for murder, I had become very afraid of him.<br /><br />\\"Leopards don't change their spots. Crab apple trees don't suddenly grow cherries.

The resolution explains that because 'children need guidance and protection by adults to ensure their maturation is timely' parents should be 'free from interference from the distribution of inappropriate publicly cataloged materials.'<br /><br />\\"HR 1039 was introduced by Rep. Sally Kern (R-Oklahoma City), who released a statement after the resolution?s passage that affirmed lawmakers are 'not looking to ban any books' but merely acknowledging that 'there are some issues little children aren't emotionally equipped to tackle, and many parents believe the issue of sexual preference is one of them.' \\"<br /><br />(Certain unenlightened library systems in Oklahoma are already scurrying to get these books back in the closet where they belong.)<br /><br />\\"E.T. does not have a fabulous name and is majorly ugly, but ever since the first time I saw him (I was six), I couldn't get him out of my mind.

This feeling came from her mother, who often gazed at her daughter coolly, as if she couldn't imagine having such a plain-looking, solemn-faced daughter. Forced to wear a back brace to correct a curvature of the spine, Eleanor knew 'as a child knows these things,' that her mother was bitterly disappointed in her physical features. 'I can remember,' wrote Eleanor, 'standing in the door, very often with my finger in my mouth which was, of course, forbidden--and I can see the look in her eyes and hear the tone in her voice as she said: \\"Come in, Granny.\\" If a visitor was there, she might turn and say, \\"She is such a funny child, so old-fashioned that we always call her Granny.\\" I wanted to sink through the floor in shame.'<br /><br />\\"Eleanor tried desperately to please her mother. Small as she was, she often sat and rubbed [her mother] Anna's temples for hours on end, easing her migraine headaches. 'The feeling that I was useful,' Eleanor later said, 'was perhaps the greatest joy I experienced.' \\"<br /><br />In the manner of American Idol, AOL and the Discovery Channel have been conducting an online process to determine \\"The Greatest American.\\" Happening upon the poll containing the Final Five last week, and reading aloud to Shari what was being done, she grumbled in response to the fact that the remaining contestants were all men. I haven't yet dared to tell her which of those five men has since taken the top spot, thanks to 2.4 million online voters with the wisdom to believe that Ronald Reagan was a greater America than was MLK, Abe Lincoln, Ben Franklin, or the dude with the wooden teeth.<br /><br />If those participating in \\"The Greatest American\\" voting had had the wisdom to make sure that at least one American woman be present among those final contestants, who would have been the most likely female to fill such a spot? OUR ELEANOR provides readers with more than enough evidence for proposing that Eleanor Roosevelt be considered as one of the greatest of citizens in the history of America, irregardless of gender. Candace Fleming does a sensational job of recounting the amazing accomplishments of Eleanor Roosevelt, both in Eleanor's own right, and as the eyes, ears and often the conscience of her husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<br /><br />But at least as important as unveiling the record of Eleanor's prodigious achievements on the national and world stage, the author succeeds brilliantly in revealing the real woman behind the public figure. Closely examined are the relationships with her parents, her husband, her children, her mother-in-law, her friends, and famous world leaders, as well as with the hundreds of thousands of nameless everyday people, both Americans and others, with whom she came in contact over her long, oftentimes difficult life.<br /><br />\\"[Franklin's mother] Sara frequently made thoughtless. stinging comments that deeply hurt Eleanor. Once, in front of a dozen dinner guests, Sara turned to her daughter-in-law. 'If you'd just run a comb through your hair, dear,' she said, 'you'd look so much better.' Another time, during a luncheon party, Sara left Eleanor standing while she showed all the other guests to their seats. She was already serving the soup when she finally turned to her daughter-in-law. 'Oh, yes, Eleanor,' she said snidely, 'you sit there.<br /><br />\\"With the births of Franklin and Eleanor's five children, Sara's interference became intolerable, causing terrible family friction. Sara spoiled them from infancy to adulthood with expensive presents--ponies, trips, cars, apartments. As one of the children put it long afterward, 'Granny's ace in the hole...was the fact that she held the pursestrings in the family.' Worse, Sara undercut Eleanor's authority and confidence by repeatedly calling the children hers. She once told little Jimmy, 'Your mother only bore you, I am more your mother than your mother is.' \\"<br /><br />When the emotional and verbal abuse by her mother and then her mother-in-law led to serious difficulties in fulfilling her role as mother to her children, Eleanor eventually turned to mothering the American people through the Great Depression and World War II. A woman who wore through the soles of two pairs of shoes while meeting 400,000 servicemen during a five-week trip to the war-torn South Pacific of WWII, Eleanor is revealed by Ms. Fleming to be both a woman of her times and a woman who was driven to move far beyond those times to change the world to the benefit of all who have come since.<br /><br />Speaking of driven:<br /><br />\\"Independence-seeking Eleanor took up driving--an uncommon activity for women of her social class, who usually took taxis or rode in chauffeur-driven cars--in 1920. She had tried to learn years earlier, but an incident involving a car bumper and a gatepost had put her off. Now however, she longed to experience the freedom of driving. There were many mishaps. 'Your running into the ditch was all right,' Sara wrote her in 1922, 'so long as you were not hurt.' Still, Eleanor drove herself to church, to luncheons, to speaking events. Once, to her family's dismay, she even drove herself on a camping trip to Canada and reported only three minor accidents. Admitted her son James, 'Mother's driving was worse than anyone's.' She scraped, bumped, and banged her way down the road until 1946, the year she fell asleep behind the wheel. Her car veered across the highway, slammed into another vehicle head-on, then sideswiped one more. The accident cost Eleanor her two front teeth.\\"<br /><br />As with BEN FRANKLIN'S ALMANAC, the author's previous biography, OUR ELEANOR is written in a series of well-illustrated one- and two-page self-contained sections. Even more than with the Ben Franklin book, the various sections of the Eleanor \\"scrapbook\\" flow easily into one another to form an entertaining and enlightening narrative. Mixed right in with Eleanor's convincing her husband to disband the Japanese internment camps, her evolution from anti-Semite to supporter of Israel, her service at the United Nations, and her long career as a writer, are great stories about her attempt to be taught to use a gun in lieu of the Secret Service agent with whom she refused to be stuck, her support of public libraries, and the 3,271 page FBI file that J. Edgar Hoover compiled on her.<br /><br />\\"On April 20, 1933, the world-famous aviator Amelia Earhart attended a dinner at the White House. Afterward she invited Eleanor along on an airplane flight from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore and back--the first lady's first night trip. Eager to show the public how easy and safe air travel was, Eleanor quickly agreed. Afterward reporters asked how it felt to be piloted by a woman. Eleanor replied, 'I'd give a lot to do it myself!'

I was deep inside the cold, smothering belly of a grave when my first haunting began. I heard her voice in the darkness reading Keats, 'Ode to a Nightingale.' Icy water was burning down my throat, splintering my ribs, and my ears were filled with a sound like a demon howling, but I could hear her voice and reached for her. One desperate hand burst from the flood and caught the hem of her gown. I dragged myself, hand over hand, out of the earth and quaked at her feet, clutching her skirts, weeping muddy tears. All I knew was that I had been tortured in the blackness, and then I had escaped. Perhaps I hadn't reached the brightness of heaven, but at least I was here, in her lamplight, safe.\\"<br /><br />It was more than 150 years ago when the dead woman's tortured spirit became a \\"prisoner on leave from the dungeon.\\" Helen can not be seen, nor heard, nor felt, although her emotions can occasionally send \\"a ripple into the tangible world.\\" During those years, Helen has cleaved to a series of unwitting hosts, learned through trial and error the rules by which she must abide in order to prevent a return to her hell, and has periodically chosen another acceptable and convenient person to haunt (preferably one with some tie to literature, which she so loves) for when her current host grows old and dies.<br /><br />The latest of Helen's hosts is an English teacher, Mr. Brown, and it is in his classroom that it happens:<br /><br />\\"Someone was looking at me, a disturbing sensation if you're dead. I was with my teacher, Mr. Brown. As usual, we were in our classroom, that safe and wooden-walled box--the windows opening onto the grassy field to the west, the fading flag standing in the chalk dust corner, the television mounted above the bulletin board like a sleeping eye, and Mr. Brown's princely table keeping watch over a regiment of student desks. At that moment I was scribbling invisible comments in the margins of a paper left in Mr. Brown's tray, though my words were never read by the students. Sometimes Mr. Brown quoted me, all the same, while writing his own comments. Perhaps I couldn't tickle the inside of his ear, but I could reach the mysterious curves of his mind.<br /><br />\\"Although I could not feel paper between my fingers, smell ink, or taste the tip of a pencil, I could see and hear the world with all the clarity of the Living. They, on the other hand, did not see me as a shadow or a floating vapor. To the Quick, I was empty air. \\"Or so I thought. As an apathetic girl read aloud from Nicholas Nickleby, as Mr. Brown began to daydream about how he had kept his wife awake the night before, as my spectral pen hovered over a misspelled word, I felt someone watching me. Not even my beloved Mr. Brown could see me with his eyes. I had been dead so long, hovering at the side of my hosts, seeing and hearing the world but never being heard by anyone and never, in all these long years, never being seen by human eyes. I held stone still while the room folded in around me like a closing hand. When I looked up, it was not in fear but in wonder. My vision telescoped so that there was only a small hole in the darkness to see through. And that's where I found it, the face that was turned up to me.<br /><br />\\"Like a child playing at hide and seek, I did not move, in case I had been mistaken about being spotted. And childishly I felt both the desire to stay hidden and a thrill of anticipation about being caught. For this face, turned squarely to me, had eyes set directly on mind.\\"<br /><br />So begins the teenage love story of the year, and a supernatural one at that.<br /><br />The young man who can see and hear Helen is Billy Blake, a human whose body has been taken over by a ghost named James at the moment its drug-addled teen owner checked out.<br /><br />The two main difficulties facing Helen and James are:<br /><br />Can Helen get a body of her own?<br /><br />What happens when you suddenlybecome a troubled teenager but are not familiar with those thousands of details about the life you've supposedly been living.<br /><br />Here this scenario takes on a whole different dimension from THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER.<br /><br />Alternating between sensual, gritty, dark, delightful, and frightening; between atmospheric fantasy and down-and dirty contemporary YA realism, A CERTAIN SLANT OF LIGHT is absolutely awash in literary quality and an award winner waiting to happen.<br /><br />You'll be seeing this one on my Best of 2005 list later this year.you suddenly become a troubled teenager but are not familiar with those thousands of details about the life you've supposedly been living.  <br /> <br />Here this scenario takes on a whole different dimension from THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER.  <br /> <br />Alternating between sensual, gritty, dark, delightful, and frightening; between atmospheric fantasy and down-and dirty contemporary YA realism, A CERTAIN SLANT OF LIGHT is absolutely awash in literary quality and an award winner waiting to happen. <br /> <br />You'll be seeing this one on my Best of 2005 list later this year. <br />	2005-10-02

He liked the work of the hoses and the swish of the thick blue-white milk coming through them. Most especially, he liked tending Moon and Star, who didn't care to be milked by machine, thank you.\\"<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember flying kites over expansive cow pastures on Manetto Hill Road, in Plainview, Long Island. But that, and the glass bottles of milk that were delivered to the front stoop by the milk man, were pretty much as close to cows as I came while growing up in the suburbs.<br /><br />I remember listening to my sister Elaine once, after she'd read and re-read MISTY OF CHINCOTEAGUE. She must have been ten at the time, hanging out on a Saturday afternoon in Peggy Dean's backyard, solemnly listing for Peggy all the animals she was going to have on the farm she'd acquire when she was grown up. I recall quite vividly overhearing that conversation, as the idea of living on a farm seemed so exotic to me at the time.<br /><br />It's fascinating to recall that afternoon now, having spent the latter half of my life (so far), living with a herd of dairy goats, fenced pastures, and the relatively open and rolling expanses that are so different from the confines of the fifty-by-hundred lot in Plainview and the fenced quarter-acre in Commack on which I grew up.<br /><br />\\"Through Geometry he thought about filling the grain bins from the sacks he had carried in that morning. And after he got home from freshman cross, there would be the Orchard to mow. And there was still some splitting for this winter's woodpile--he was behind on that--and more hay to haul to the barn loft. And that top porch step to fix.<br /><br />\\"He thought about the chores through every class and wondered how much he was missing what his grandfather used to do without saying anything about it. It worried him through World Cultures, where he found it hard to care much about Ancient Egyptian Trade Routes. And it worried him through English, where he couldn't muster up much concern for whether Beatrice served God, loved Benedick, and mended or not. But the ending of the play, when the prince was left all alone--that had something to it. He knew what that was about.\\"<br /><br />Fifteen year-old Cooper Jewett is feeling very alone after his grandfather dies. It has just been the two of them living on the New Lincoln, New Hampshire dairy farm for those years after his grandmother had passed away; so different from his buddy Peter Hurd, whose family was so large \\"they could almost field both sides of a baseball game.\\" He loves the farm with all his heart, and is determined to stay on it, but after the first few days alone he seems about ready to drown in a bottomless pit of daily work, despite the assistance of the neighbors: Mrs. Perley, from up the hill, and a fellow farmer, Mr. Searle.<br /><br />\\"As for homework: If Mrs. Perley hadn't brought his backpack in from the front porch, he would have forgotten he'd left it there. Not that it would have made much difference. He went up to his room with it but never opened it that night. Geometry theorems went unproved, Ancient Egyptian Trade Routes went unmapped, and Benedick's blank verse went unscanned.<br /><br />\\"Cooper slept without moving all night long.<br /><br />\\"And when he woke up in the morning, there wasn't even a moment when he didn't remember that he had to do it ALL OVER AGAIN.\\"<br /><br />Gary Schmidt captures both the natural beauty and down-to-earth reality of life on the farm in a way that I've never before had the pleasure of reading. I just love watching Cooper take one last walk through the barn before bedtime, making sure to gently pat each and every cow nose goodnight.<br /><br />But that is only the beginning of what Schmidt sows in FIRST BOY, a satire in which he deftly intersperses community secrets and national political intrigue with (real) traditional values and gentle, folksy humor (a laGarrison Keillor) that pokes fun at the various religious denominations and makes frequent references to well-baked pies.<br /><br />Especially notable amidst the craziness is the hero who emerges, Mrs. Perley, the retired teacher:<br /><br />\\" 'They'll be arranging for someone to pick you up. It's for your own good.'<br /><br />\\" 'Cooper is fine where he is,' said Mrs. Perley. \\"Now the sheriff came around his desk. His hands were clenching and unclenching like a gunfighter in an old Western.<br /><br />\\" 'Neither of you has any idea what you're mixed up in,' he said, and it was as if his voice had become as cold as Fright. 'Not a single idea.' He looked hard at Cooper. 'Life isn't always what you expect it to be. Sometimes it can be full of surprises.'<br /><br />\\" 'I've seen surprises,' said Cooper. 'I'll make due.'<br /><br />\\"Mrs. Perley put an arm around him.<br /><br />\\" 'We'll see how long that lasts.' Sheriff Gibbs turned back to Mrs. Perley. 'And maybe you'd better stay up in your own house. This isn't New Lincoln Elementary anymore.'<br /><br />\\" 'Do not begin a sentence with a conjunction, Raymond. It is grammatically improper,' said Mrs. Perley.<br /><br />\\"Sheriff Gibbs went back around his desk. 'Thank you for the visit,' he said. 'I'll be sure to type up a report and get right on the case--Raging Birth Certificate Thief on the Loose.' He sat down and put his feet up on the desk again. He rubbed his chin and clasped his hands on his belly, over which there was a lot to clasp. 'New Lincoln police, always at your service,' he said.<br /><br />\\"Outside the sheriff's office, Mrs. Perley stood by her Plymouth with her key in her hand. 'He certainly is a most unpleasant man--as helpful as a thunderstorm during a Sunday School picnic. What does he mean by accusing you of making up the entire story?' She spoke more and more quickly and waved the key at Cooper. 'What did he mean by that? And how did he know about the black sedan? Drat!' She punched her hand into the air. 'See how upset he has made me? I've begun a sentence with a conjunction myself. And he's made me say drat. Oh, and there I go again with another conjunction.'<br /><br />\\" 'I won't ever tell,' said Cooper.<br /><br />\\" 'Thank you. And drat that man anyway.' \\"<br /><br />Having spent a quarter century milking Nubian dairy goats myself, what impressed me above all about FIRST BOY is that while there is so much going on in this zany tale, Cooper Jewett never once fails to register that it is milking time.or (a la Garrison Keillor) that pokes fun at the various religious denominations and makes frequent references to well-baked pies.  <br /> <br />Especially notable amidst the craziness is the hero who emerges, Mrs. Perley, the retired teacher:  <br /> <br />\\" 'They'll be arranging for someone to pick you up.

In spite of the thousands of dead bodies all around me, I have a dreadful idea. There are so many trousers lying here, some bloody, some clean. Depending on whether the soldiers were shot in their upper or lower halves. All I need to do is take them away from a dead man. Simple.<br /><br />\\"Then I suddenly feel my body heave. I sit down on an empty spot on the battlefield and vomit up half my stomach.<br /><br />\\"For his part, Konrad Klara can hardly walk, but he helps get me back on my feet.<br /><br />\\"Bare and naked we stumble about among the mutilated heroes.<br /><br />\\"I narrow my eyes to the merest slit. So that I don't see everything. I'm only out for suitable trousers. Most of them are no use at all. They are slashed, holed, or sodden with blood. But here's a pair that might do for my lieutenant. Their wearer has been shot in the chest. The trousers didn't take any damage. Now's not the time to hang around. Yes or no. Stay naked or rob the dead. I drop to my knees in front of the dead soldier, and pull at his trousers. I'm in a hurry. I want it to be over. Fortunately, it's pretty dark. That way I can't see the dead man's face. The trousers are fashionably tight. I can't get them over the shoes. So shoes off, too. They are good shoes. They might fit me. I try them on. They're still warm. Why warm? The soldier twitches. He's alive.<br /><br />\\"My head spins and everything goes black. I throw the shoes down and crawl away.\\"<br /><br />Adam Feucher is a sixteen-year-old orphan working as a stableboy in Germany in 1811. He's great with the horses. Never in his life has he been as far as town; he truly is an innocent. Then the farmer, to whom he essentially belongs, awakens him in the middle of the night, brings him to town, and dupes both he and the conscription commission into taking Adam as if he were actually the farmer's real (and only) son Georg. Such is the manner in which Adam becomes one of the nearly half-million men (and boys) heading for Russia in Napoleon's Grande Armee.<br /><br />Konrad Klara is the young aristocratic lieutenant who eventually takes on handy-with-the-horses Adam as his personal servant, saving the stableboy-turned-reluctant soldier from the sadistic Sergeant Krauter.<br /><br />The pair are extremely different in some ways, surprisingly similar in others.

Together they develop the sort of closer-than-brothers relationship that is so intense and intimate in its power that it transcends the book's historic fiction elements and war-as-insanity theme.<br /><br />Of the many great things to be said about Mildred Taylor's THE LAND, it is the relationship between Paul Edward Logan and Mitchell Thomas which cements that book as one of my all-time favorite reads.

Wandering around the venue well before the start of the show, I unwittingly offered to sell the extra ticket to an undercover Nassau County cop who responded by handcuffing me, dragging me into the Coliseum security office, and stripping me.  As I wasn't \\"holding,\\" I was eventually directed not to do anything stupid and released in time for the beginning of the show.<br /><br />So, alas, I have no experience with joint jive (prison language).  Fortunately for me and the younger fish (new prisoners) who get their hands on this book, Harry Sue precedes the telling of her amazing tale by providing an extensive Joint Jive Glossary so that we can understand what she's bumpin' her gums about.<br /><br />Harriet Susan Clotkin has learned to speak in Conglish (a combination of joint jive and English).  She's hoping to soon get over her softheartedness so that she can begin a life of crime, get herself sent up, and hopefully become reunited with the mother she hasn't seen or heard from since she was five, back when her parents were both sent to prison.<br /><br />\\"Before we go any further, we have to go back.  Way back.  Seven years back, to the day of my accident.  You can't fully appreciate the saga of Harry Sue unless you know the backstory.  Every conette has a backstory.  It's hard enough returning to the night that changed my life forever, but if it was up to my road dog, Homer, we'd go back even further.<br />\\"You see, Homer would argue that my father, Garnett Clotkin, didn't just show up to our apartment that night swearing and spitting like a rabid dog for no reason at all.  Not everyone expresses their anger with violence.  Garnett had to be trained to it.<br />\\" 'Maybe your granny tied his shoes too tight,' he'd offer, or 'Maybe it was her habit of dunking his head in toilet water when he sassed her.'<br />\\"I say, any way you slice it, it's still bread.\\"<br /><br />That fateful night, unable to convince his wife Mary Bell to take him back, Harry Sue's drunken father had angrily proceeded to throw his daughter out of the window--which happened to be seven stories up.  Harry Sue fortunately ended up bouncing around in an elm tree through which she descended in a \\"slow motion game of pinball,\\" ending up with \\"a severe case of bruising, a dislocated shoulder, and two broken ribs.\\"  Unfortunately, when her mother rushed downstairs after Harry Sue, \\"she forgot to put away the toy chemistry lab she'd set up on the table to make crystal methamphetamine, or crank as it's called on the street, an illegal drug she mostly used herself to stay awake while working the swing shift at the auto glass factory.\\"<br /><br />Both parents gone in one fell swoop.<br /><br />Harry Sue's aforementioned paternal grandmother has always resented Mary Bell, the woman she believes ruined her son's life by getting pregnant.  Granny also despises the product of that pregnancy.  Unfortunately, Harry Sue has had to spend the past seven years doing time at her grandmother's house.  And it's there that, to make a buck, Granny runs a home daycare operation called \\"Granny's Lap\\" that makes Christopher Paul Curtis' unscrupulous Sarge character look like a regular Mother Theresa.  If there is anywhere that you can especially see the softness of Harry Sue's heart exposed, it's when she hangs out after school with the little \\"crumb snatchers,\\" to whom she's all taught joint jive, and to whom she tells stories like \\"The Three Little Pork Rinds,\\" and \\"Red the Hood.\\"<br /><br />The one person Harry Sue's always turned to is her longtime road dog (friend you know you can count on), Christopher Dinkins a.k.a. Homer Price.<br /><br />\\"Homer's nick came from his habit of dreaming up inventions, and before the accident, building them, too.<br />\\"But that was all before he got slammed with, not a deuce, not an eight ball, not a dime, but an all day...Yes, it's true, Fish.  Homer Price maxed out with a life sentence for the crime of diving off the Grand Haven pier.\\"<br /><br />Since surviving that headfirst dive into a rock, Christopher/Homer, who is now a quadriplegic, spends his days lying on his back, gazing out a window in the treehouse that he's designed in the backyard with a lift to get him and his bed up there.  He dreams up inventions Harry Sue needs to get by and, in turn, she keeps him company and works hard to pull him out of the dark place he sometimes gets himself boxed into.<br /><br />Life is a dark place for Harry Sue as well.

On other days we'd draw chalk mazes in the street to ride our bikes around. There were a trio of older girls who'd often want to organize us younger kids. Once they spent a week making us rehearse for a show in the garage next store.

'Do you need a place to stay?' The boy nods his head slowly.<br /><br />\\"Nusrat reaches into a bowl on the table that stands in front of the window beside their chairs and picks up a bright orange persimmon that sits on top of a pyramid of ripe fruit. She takes the boy's hand and turns it palm up to place the fruit in it. She runs her finger over the calluses at the base of his fingers and below the center knuckles and looks up into his eyes, which watch her intently as she places the fruit in the cup of his palm and curls his fingers up over it.<br /><br />\\" 'Well,' says Nusrat. 'Don't worry.' \\"<br /><br />If you want some basic information about a foreign country, one place you can find it online is in the Central Intelligence Agency's \\"The World Factbook.\\" In looking up Afghanistan in the CIA's \\"The World Factbook\\" I learned that as of 10 February, 2005 (which was when their facts were last updated), the population of Afghanistan was around 28 and a half million people. I also learned that the life expectancy at birth in Afghanistan as of 10 February, 2005 is 42 and a half years. (This compares to California with a population of 35 million and a life expectancy at birth of 79 and a half years.)<br /><br />So, if I lived in Afghanistan, the odds are that I'd currently be dead for the past 7 and a half years.<br /><br />Earlier this year I wrote about PINNED, a terrific story about two high school wrestlers from two different towns in New Jersey (where the life expectancy at birth is two years less than in California). As I explained in my write-up of PINNED, \\"In alternating chapters we get to know about complications in the lives, the loves, and the families, as well as the fears of these two young men who are clearly destined to meet at the season finale.\\"<br /><br />Well, in Suzanne Fisher Staple's latest book UNDER THE PERSIMMON TREE, there are also a pair of main characters--young women who are clearly destined to meet up--and we similarly \\"get to know about complications in the lives, the loves, and the families, as well as the fears\\" of these two characters.<br /><br />And since these are young females in post-9/11 Afghanistan--one there by birth, the other by choice--the complications and fears we're talking about are off the charts as compared to the average character in New Jersey, California, or just about anywhere else in the world.<br /><br />\\"I know you're out there somewhere<br /><br />Somewhere, somewhere<br /><br />I know you're out there somewhere<br /><br />Somewhere you can hear my voice<br /><br />I know I'll find you somehow<br /><br />Somehow, somehow,<br /><br />I know I'll find you somehow<br /><br />And somehow I'll return again to you.\\"<br /><br />--The Moody Blues<br /><br />To see your father and brother conscripted at gunpoint into the Taliban, your opium poppy-growing uncle scheming to take away your family's land, and then watch your mother and newborn baby brother get blown up in a bombing by your so-called \\"liberators,\\" seems like more than enough \\"complications\\" for three or four stories put together. But for Najmah (whose name means \\"Star\\"), a tweener from a shepherding family from Kunduz Province in Afghanistan, this is just the beginning of her story.<br /><br />Then there is Nusrat. Nusrat was originally named Elaine. She grew up in Upstate New York. Years after the only person in the whole world who really knew her died, her sister Margaret, Elaine had immersed herself in a teaching job and a second job at an animal shelter. But she still couldn't get past the pain of Margaret's inexplicable death until she fell in love with her fellow Manhattan apartment dweller, Faiz, a handsome young doctor from Afghanistan who said her name should be Nusrat (which means \\"Help\\"). .<br /><br />Now Faiz is off trying to save lives in a clinic deep in the war zone of Afghanistan, and Nusrat is just over the border in Pakistan where she spends her days teaching writing and 'rithmetic to refugee kids.<br /><br />Because of the chaos of war, neither young woman has any idea whether their loved ones are dead or alive.<br /><br />UNDER THE PERSIMMON TREE is an uncompromising look into the lives and hearts of these two young female characters from the other side of the world.

(Shari, on the beach, would occasionally yell when I was about to crack my head on one of the perimeter boulders.) I got frustratingly close, but never did succeed in tagging one of the girls.<br /><br />There is nothing with which I associate summer more than swimming. I spent my childhood and adolescence back East within a short drive of some beautiful Long Island Sound beaches where I would practice the strokes and lifesaving techniques that I had mastered over previous summers at day camps and Scout camps, and get to swim around underwater, exploring. In addition to those frequent visits to the Sound, and occasional weeks when we'd vacation on the beaches in the Hamptons, I grew up with a series of larger and larger swimming pools in the backyard.<br /><br />It could well be that the most memorable summer of my life was the one that followed eighth grade. It was 1969, and my parents had just purchased one of those rectangular vinyl pools with a diving hole on one end and an expansive deck around the whole thing. I recall many days that summer when everyone else was gone and I got to splash around in the pool all day by myself, accompanied by a portable radio with MusicRadio 77WABC blasting out \\"The Israelites,\\" \\"Crystal Blue Persuasion,\\" \\"What Does it Take (To Win Your Love for Me),\\" and \\"These Eyes.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you both own a gun and have a swimming pool in the backyard, the swimming pool is about 100 times more likely to kill a child than the gun is.\\"<br /><br />Damn! And I'd just been dreaming of actually getting one here at the farm. (A pool, not a gun.)<br /><br />After our picnic lunch at the river yesterday, I found a bit of shade and finished up the amazing book I've been reading. Steve Levitt, a professor who has won some sort of award as the nation's best young economist, and Stephen Dubner, a New York Times writer who'd originally interviewed Levitt a few years ago, have put together a book in which very interesting and sometimes controversial topics (such as comparing incidences of accidental child shootings versus accidental pool drownings) are analyzed \\"by the numbers.\\"<br /><br />\\"What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor, and sometimes all three. What sort of future might her child have had? One study has shown that the typical child who went unborn in the early years of legalized abortion would have been 50 percent more likely than average to live in poverty; he would have also been 60 percent more likely to grow up with just one parent. These two factors--childhood poverty and a single-parent household--are among the strongest predictors that a child will have a criminal future. Growing up in a single-parent home roughly doubles a child's propensity to commit crime. So does having a teenage mother. Another study has shown that low maternal education is the single most powerful factor leading to criminality.<br /><br />\\"In other words, the very factors that drove millions of American women to have an abortion also seemed to predict that their children, had they been born, would have led unhappy and possibly criminal lives...<br /><br />\\"Perhaps the most dramatic effect of legalized abortion...and one that would take years to reveal itself, was its impact on crime. In the early 1990s, just as the first cohort of children born after Roe v. Wade was hitting its late teen years--the years during which young men enter their criminal prime--the rate of crime began to fall. What this cohort was missing, of course, were the children who stood the greatest chance of becoming criminals. And the crime rate continued to fall as an entire generation came of age minus the children whose mothers had not wanted to bring a child into the world. Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime; legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime.\\"<br /><br />In a book that has a lot to teach adolescent and adult readers about objective examination of motivations, cause-and-effect, the frequently self-serving proclamations of experts, information literacy, crack dealing, and mathmatics, Levitt and Dubner ask such questions as \\"What do Schoolteachers and Sumo Wrestlers Have in Common?,\\" \\"How is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real-Estate Agents?,\\" and \\"Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?<br /><br />As the authors explain about the nature of economics:<br /><br />\\"Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work--whereas economics represents how it actually does work.

I'd have a great idea for this brilliant tune where the lyrics and the melody and the sounds and the arrangement would all complement each other and resolve into a perfect three-minute encapsulation of a true experience that would play with the listeners' emotions while simultaneously crushing their skulls. I would start speculating about how it was only a matter of time before they awarded me the Nobel Prize for Rock and Roll, once word of it got round to Sweden.

When we first elected Barbara to the US Senate in 1992, having her join Diane Feinstein there in representing California, it was the first time in US history that two women Senators were representing the same state at the same time.<br /><br />Myra Bradwell would have though that it was long past time.<br /><br />\\"In 1869, Mrs. Bradwell passed the Illinois bar exam with high honors and turned in her application to practice law.  Though she easily qualified, she was turned down because she was a married woman.  She filed a lawsuit, but the Illinois Supreme Court turned her down too, saying that her sex was 'a sufficient reason for not granting this license.'<br /><br />\\"In one of the nation's first sex discrimination cases she appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  But America's top court had a different view than she did.  'Man is, or should be, woman's protector and defender,' the Court wrote in 1873.  'The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life.'  It concluded: 'The paramount destiny and mission of woman [is] to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother.  This is the law of the Creator.' \\"<br /><br />It does not require looking back a hundred and something years to the life of Myra Bradwell (who, we learn, persevered to become America's first female lawyer) in order to recall when things were really unfair for women in America.  I grew up a youngster not all THAT long ago, in a world where women didn't have the same opportunities as men to go to college, didn't have the same opportunities as men to work in many fields, to attain the highest positions in business, government, or education, to get paid the same money for the same work, and sure as heck didn't have the same athletic opportunities as their male counterparts.<br /><br />As recalled in LET ME PLAY by Karen Blumenthal, it was in 1964 (when I turned nine, the same year the Beatles first came to America), that a Southern segregationist in Congress unintentionally played an important role in promoting women's rights when he \\"proposed adding the word 'sex' to the section [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964], so that it would forbid job discrimination against women as well as blacks.\\"  Congressman Howard W. Smith of Virginia was figuring that adding such an amendment would cause the male-dominated Congress to quickly sink the entire Act including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the historic Civil Rights legislation would create.  That Smith's plan backfired and the legislation passed meant for the first time in our history that it was illegal to pay a woman differently than a man employed in the same position as she.<br /><br />\\"State universities in Virginia had turned away 21,000 women in the early 1960s; during the same time not a single man was turned away.\\"<br /><br />While the author takes us back to the 1800s and forward to the 1960s in setting the stage, the overwhelming focus of her fascinating and important book about women in America is on the fight for passage of and subsequent fights over enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as well as the far-reaching changes in our country that resulted from that landmark legislation.<br /><br />Blumenthal's well-documented story of Title IX is interspersed with illuminating profiles and photos of notable twentieth century female athletes who got badly cheated by being born in the backward days of the earlier 1900s, along with great profiles of the federal legislative heroes responsible for Title IX passage, and a terrific assortment of strips from Doonsbury, Tank McNamara, Peanuts and other daily comics and political cartoons that shed light on the legislation and the issues behind it.<br /><br />\\"At the University of Georgia the budget for women's sports grew to $120,000 in 1978 from $1,000 in 1973, but the men received $2.5 million.

NOTES FROM A LIAR AND HER DOG made my Best of 2001 list and it was the best first novel I read that entire year.  Having booktalked it (particularly to fifth and sixth graders)for the past four years now, I've had exceptionally positive feedback.)<br /><br />At the conclusion of the first chapter of NOTES FROM A LIAR AND HER DOG, the Assistant Principal asks Ant (Antonia MacPherson) to relay the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf:<br /><br />\\"I run my tongue over my teeth. 'Some kid pretended he saw a wolf a bunch of times, and everyone came to help him. Then when he really saw the wolf, they all thought he was kidding and they didn't come, and the wolf ate him.'<br /><br />'That's right. And what do you think the boy learned?' Mr. Borgdorf asks.<br /><br />'He didn't learn anything. He's dead.'<br /><br />Mr. Borgdorf's eyes flash angry. His lips roll in. 'Fair enough. But why? What was the mistake he made?'<br /><br />I blow my hair off my forehead and consider the question. 'He was stupid. He shouldn't have expected anyone to help in the first place. He should have handled the wolf by himself. That's what I would have done.' \\"<br /><br />And that is what Ant is all about--taking matters into her own hands because she truly doesn't trust the adults and other kids in her life. She sees her mother as believing that she is wrong and/or lying, no matter what she does. Her younger sister (Katherine the Great) takes notes on Ant's misdeeds, while her older sister (Her Royal Highness Elizabeth) insists she's working on becoming a juvenile delinquent. The one person she does trust is her friend Harrison Emerson, the character who continues haunting my thoughts in this wonderfully funny and deceptively complex first novel by Gennifer Choldenko.<br /><br />\\"My mom hates Harrison because he eats with his mouth open, walks his pet chicken on a leash, and because he's always scratching at something. I'm not friends with Harrison because my mom doesn't like him, though. I'm friends with him because I like him. That my mom doesn't like him is something extra, like a bonus.\\"<br /><br />In the story, Harrison and Ant are taken under wing by their art teacher who sees the saving graces in the two of them. Ant's father's career changes have frequently uprooted the family in the past and once again threaten upheaval. There are the health issues of Ant's beloved very funky little old dog. (And there are even a bunch of wild animals.) But most importantly there are situations resulting from Ant's 'self-reliance' which run from the legally and morally appalling, to the heartwarming, to the horrifically heart-stopping.<br /><br />Because the story is told from Ant's egocentric perspective, the truth is never entirely clear. After reading the book and getting my wife (the middle school English teacher) to read it, we had enthusiastic debates about whether Ant had ever given us an honest picture of the other characters. (Indeed, I would just love to see Harrison Emerson reemerge from another perspective in a later book.)outh open, walks his pet chicken on a leash, and because he's always scratching at something.

The best part of being \\"on the floor\\" at ALA Midwinter is the abundance of editors in attendance. It is always exciting to get an earful of what these frequently unsung heroes of the children's publishing industry actually have their hands on, along with what they've just completed in collaboration with their talented authors.<br /><br />Anne Schwartz is one of those brilliant and charming editors with whom I love to chat. When Shari and I encountered Anne in San Antonio at that 2000 Midwinter convention, I immediately asked her what hot new literary magic she had up her sleeve for the distant fall season, then eight or nine months down the road.<br /><br />When Anne responded that I HAD to see the picture book she'd just finished I was momentarily disappointed. The best thing you have for the entire fall season is a picture book? I said to myself, my hope having been that she'd instead be raving about the manuscript for some spectacular novel for eight-to-twelve-year-olds.<br /><br />But my skepticism instantly evaporated as she opened a manilla file and pulled out a paste-up of OLIVIA. I'll never forget that first reading, including the ending when:<br /><br />\\"Olivia's mom gives her a kiss and says, 'You know, you really wear me out. But I love you anyway.' And Olivia gives her a kiss back and says, 'I love you anyway too.' \\"<br /><br />\\"Close your eyes and I'll close mine, goodnight sleep tight<br /><br />Now the moon begins to shine, goodnight sleep tight<br /><br />Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you.\\"<br /><br />--The Beatles<br /><br />I recall the OLIVIA incident because Rob Scotton's RUSSELL THE SHEEP is the cutest and funniest and best illustrated animal character I've seen in a picture book since OLIVIA. And while RUSSELL THE SHEEP won't officially come to the attention of the Caldecott committee the way OLIVIA did (being that Rob Scotton is British not American), I will be shocked if Russell does not similarly grab the Book Sense Illustrated Book of the Year award after he grabs the hearts and imaginations of large herds of American kids, young and old.<br /><br />Rob Scotton is certainly no unknown quantity in Britain. Not only a celebrated illustrator of greeting cards and posters, his animal characters even adorn a series of Portmerion china.<br /><br />But the exploits of Russell and the expressions of the various sheep characters in his first picture book go far beyond anything Scotton's accomplished previously. Within just one of the book's first illustrations (\\"...night fell and the sheep got ready for bed.\\"), you have Russell prancing atop a tree while one sheep is brushing its teeth, one is holding a steaming mug of cocoa, one is heavy-eyed and clutching a teddy bear, and one old lady sheep (wearing spectacles and an old-fashioned night hat) is lying under a quilt with four feet straight up in the air and a glass containing a solution and her false teeth beside her.<br /><br />Russell goes through all sorts of delightful misadventures trying to get to sleep. And then, by the end of the story when everyone is getting up (Granny putting in her teeth, another sheep reading the Daily Bleat), Russell, of course, is fast asleep.<br /><br />Good night, Russell!nd says, 'I love you anyway too.' \\"  <br /> <br />\\"Close your eyes and I'll close mine, goodnight sleep tight <br />Now the moon begins to shine, goodnight sleep tight <br />Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you.\\" <br />--The Beatles  <br /> <br />I recall the OLIVIA incident because Rob Scotton's RUSSELL THE SHEEP is the cutest and funniest and best illustrated animal character I've seen in a picture book since OLIVIA.

She is assertive, almost snippy, confident in a crazy, old-woman way, but she is smiling, and her voice is soft, lyrical. It reminds Zoe of a bird.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for cool old ladies in children's and YA literature. No, not just in literature. I also love knowing cool old ladies in the real world. One of my best friends is a cool old lady who raises Nubian dairy goats up in the Sierra foothills.<br /><br />I think it all goes back to having had some really great teachers in junior high and high school who were of my parents' generation and who taught me so much about life and about their lives from a perspective that was different than what I'd gotten from my own parents. And it must similarly come from growing up working on my dad's construction jobs with all those old tradesmen to listen to. Those lessons continued into my post-adolescence when I returned to school in my thirties to study early childhood education (where I was usually the only guy in the class) and was taken under wing by a wise veteran teacher: an amazingly cool old lady named Teri Isaac.<br /><br />Last year when I reviewed TENDING TO GRACE, in which a very cool Great-aunt Agatha helps Cornelia find her voice, I mentioned some other cool old ladies I've adored in books:<br /><br />Gram from Cynthia Voigt's Tillerman cycle.<br /><br />Grandma Dowdell from A YEAR DOWN YONDER.<br /><br />Josie Cahill from PICTURES OF HOLLIS WOODS.<br /><br />Tilly and Penpen Menudo from THE CANNING SEASON.<br /><br />Not long after reviewing TENDING TO GRACE I got to meet Mrs. Elia Hurd in LIZZIE BRIGHT AND THE BUCKMINSTER BOY. She's definitely another one for the list. (I'd sure love to know her entire life story.)<br /><br />\\"Quietly turning the backdoor key,<br /><br />Stepping outside she is free.\\"<br /><br />--The Beatles, \\"She's Leaving Home\\"<br /><br />\\"The lady rummages through her pocket for the key. 'I still have a few things in there, but I can take them out if they don't ka-nish with your ka-nash.' She slides the key into the lock, and the door swings open.\\"<br /><br />This particular cool old lady is Opal Keats. The room in that house on Lorelei Street that seventeen-year-old Zoe Beth Buckman subsequently rents from Opal is a dream come true for the girl, given what life at home with her alcoholic mother has been. But this is by no means a sweet fairy tale.<br /><br />Following step by step (or mis-step) on Zoe's path, I can't help but feel the pressure in my own chest as I experience this young woman's determination to make the personal finances work out so that she can both maintain the control and security that the room on Lorelei Street provides her and simultaneously try to fill her stomach and gas tank, pay the transportation fee necessary for being on the tennis team, and cover the million other expenses that unexpectedly arise when Zoe is finally on her own and determined to keep it that way at any cost. With the steep price that is being exacted by a vicious teacher and a decidedly uncool grandmother, Zoe has no room for missteps.<br /><br />\\"The breeze reaches her face, fresh and cool, carrying the scent of night jasmine.

I slipped out the back door, wearing the backpack, carrying the rest, breathing in that dried pine needle scent, feeling my way step by step to the carport. Silently, I loaded everything into the pickup before hopping in, turning the key, and shattering the quiet. A minute later I was cruising down the winding main road, accompanied by Elizabeth Reed, headed in the direction of Truckee.<br /><br />At five thousand feet there are still dirty mounds of snow alongside the road, cleaner accumulations in the adjoining woods. An hour later the sky had become light, revealing rows of snow- and evergreen-covered mountains stretching to the horizon, one of the closer ones scarred by a few long white gashes down the side which are ski runs. Joining up with Interstate 80, I occasionally passed an eighteen-wheeler but otherwise had sole possession of the road. At Donner Pass I glanced over my shoulder at the long, dark lake, the wooden tunnels over the railroad tracks, and the rush of spring melt over a cliff.<br /><br />Descending from the mountains the drifts change from snow to housing developments outside Sacramento; the accumulations there are of drivers on the road. Two hours on the Interstate and I veered off into the hills south of Napa. A handful of stately wineries punctuate the miles of vineyard trellises pulled tight like the warp on a loom. The fog surrendered the hilltops and fled just before I reached them. Drifts of orange California poppies, alternating with yellows and rust reds run through the green of spring pastures in the coastal hills as I approached home.<br /><br />Sure, I get burnt out on sitting in the car for too many hours, but it's one hell of a pretty country we have. Despite all the places I've seen overtaken by progress and humanity in my fifty years, I still don't begin to take for granted what a wonderland we're so fortunate to inhabit.<br /><br />\\"And in the end they traded their tired wings<br /><br />For the resignation that living brings.\\"<br /><br />--Jackson Browne, \\"Before the Deluge\\"<br /><br />Savannah spent the first half of her life wandering around this beautiful country with her mother, Alice. She's got miles of memories about all those places they'd seen across America. I'd expect that in all that time they also gotten a taste of Donner Pass and of restored Old Town Truckee. Maybe they even got to visit the little community near Plumas-Eureka where I spent the last couple of nights.<br /><br />But Savannah and Alice's life on the road came to a halt years ago when their car broke down on the Jersey Turnpike, and they were \\"rescued\\" by Jack. Now Savannah has spent years in the same place, dealing with her abusive stepfather Jack, and helping care for her little brother Henry. Alice seems to always be off at work and oblivious to what is going on at home. But things are changing again for good because Savannah has had enough. And she loves her little brother too much to even consider taking off and leaving Henry to deal with Jack by himself.<br /><br />\\"Jack's body is blocking her vision, but she doesn't have to see Henry to know he's close to tears. Jack swings around, and now she can see her little brother, standing half in and half out of the kitchen doorway. Henry is flushed and sweating, on the verge of being sick.<br /><br />\\" 'What's the matter, buddy?' Jack says, his voice still too loud and jarring, but now forcefully bright. He holds out his arms as if waiting for Henry to run to him.<br /><br />\\"But Henry is digging one toe into the splintered doorframe.

They're not exactly what I'd refer to as Chick Lit, but they are gobbled up by similar female audiences, along with a significant number of us guys. Last year there was THE YEAR OF SECRET ASSIGNMENTS and SAVING FRANCESCA. Other good examples from previous years are CATALYST, GINGERBREAD, DEFINE NORMAL, and WHAT MY MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW.<br /><br />I suspect that many male adolescents will react to the cover of THE BOYFRIEND LIST (15 GUYS, 11 SHRINK APPOINTMENTS, 4 CERAMIC FROGS AND ME, RUBY OLIVER) as I did. The title and the ceramic frog on a white background which provides the not-so-subtle accompanying visual allusions to frogs-slash-princes did not set off any \\"Wow! Looks Like A Great Book!\\" alarms in my head as my fingers took a stroll through the box of advance copies that arrived last week.<br /><br />(Actually the cover got the opposite reaction--i.e. a very positive one, indeed--from our female 10 and 15 year-olds when they scampered through the new stack. But then they had to go do their homework and I got to read the book first.)<br /><br />Whatever you think about the cover (or Chick Lit), THE BOYFRIEND LIST is a delightful and frequently achingly honest tale--warts and all--about what happens when girls and boys meet.<br /><br />As Ruby Oliver explains within the very first footnote (of the dozens of oft-lengthy footnotes throughout the book):<br /><br />\\"I was hoping there'd be a set of guidelines handed out in Sex Ed class, but Sex Ed--when I finally got to take it--was all about biology and birth control and nothing about anything that actually goes on between people. Like how to tell what it means when someone forgets to call you when he said he would, or what to do when someone gropes your boob in a movie theater.\\"<br /><br />Ruby compiles the boyfriend list on the advice of her \\"shrink,\\" Doctor Z. She is sent to Dr. Z after experiencing a series of five panic attacks that occur within the same ten day period in which Ruby:<br /><br />\\" lost my boyfriend (boy #13)<br /><br />lost my best friend<br /><br />lost all my other friends<br /><br />learned gory details about my now-ex-boyfriend's sexual adventures<br /><br />did something shockingly advanced with boy #15<br /><br />did something suspicious with boy #10<br /><br />had an argument with boy #14<br /><br />drank my first beer<br /><br />got caught by my mom<br /><br />lost a lacrosse game<br /><br />failed a math test<br /><br />hurt Meghan's feelings<br /><br />became a leper<br /><br />and became a famous slut\\"<br /><br />The titles of the fifteen chapters that comprise THE BOYFRIEND LIST (15 GUYS, 11 SHRINK APPOINTMENTS, 4 CERAMIC FROGS AND ME, RUBY OLIVER) are the same as the fifteen listings of the boyfriend list. In these fifteen chapters Ruby recounts for Doctor Z the history of her relationships with boys, going all the way back to the little boy she used to stare at in preschool. As the proverbial \\"fly on the wall,\\" (which happens to be the title of Emily Lockhart's next book), readers are treated to an intimate look at Ruby Oliver's trial-and-error adolescent lessons in human relationships.<br /><br />From my post-adolescent perspective, so much of what I see in Ruby's relationships with her peers is strikingly similar to what I went through and/or observed with my own contemporaries.<br /><br />Of course, now that we're all grown up, we don't have to deal with those relationship problems any more. In fact, most of our kids get their first lessons in boy-girl relationships from observing the harmonious interactions between the parental units. Ruby (Roo) has quite a pair to watch:<br /><br />\\"I told my parents about the breakup on Sunday at dinner. I had to explain because my mom asked why my eyes were all puffy.<br /><br />\\"Mom: 'Oh, I never liked him anyway. He's a horrible boy. I'm going to call his mother!'<br /><br />\\"Me: 'Ag! Please don't do that!'<br /><br />\\"Dad: 'Elaine, she needs to come to a place of forgiveness. Otherwise she'll never move on.'<br /><br />\\"Mom: 'It just happened. She needs to vent.

What kind of manners is that?' \\"<br /><br />So take a nature walk through the horror and zaniness that is the teenage life of Ruby Oliver.on Sunday at dinner.

I spent a day in Shari's classroom late last week working hard to clean up the disaster zone in preparation for the occasion.<br /><br />Shari is the school's drama teacher as well as one of the eighth-grade English teachers. Her drama students are notorious for leaving their thrift store purchased costuming and props in the classroom long after the performances are all complete. I filled four huge cartons to overflowing with those items that we're not likely to need for future productions. They went to the lost and found. A couple of cartons of the \\"good stuff\\" went into the prop room.<br /><br />You would think that an English classroom should have a collection of some decent books in it, but Shari and I sort of go to extremes. Fortunately, I had brought a bunch of paper bags with me. I filled nine of them with old ARCs (advance reader copies) that I no longer cared about owning. A coordinator at juvenile hall will collect them in a couple of days and they'll get a whole new life.<br /><br />As I collected and neatly stacked the classroom sets of books (SPEAK, THE LAND, THE MISFITS, WITNESS, THE LAST BOOK IN THE UNIVERSE, LEFT FOR DEAD, 19 VARIETIES OF GAZELLE, BRONX MASQUERADE, etc.), and filled those shopping bags for juvenile hall, and filled a shelf in the office with the latest paperback purchases and 2005 ARCs, I also accumulated a very small pile of books to take back home. (\\"Like coals to Newcastle!\\" someone knowledgeable of our home might exclaim.) A few were ARCs of books that had gone on to win major awards. A couple were Richie's Picks titles that I wanted to have an extra copy of for booktalks. And I grabbed my copy of MORE THAN WORDS: THE SPEECHES OF MARIO CUOMO, which I used to delve into occasionally for inspiring \\"patriotic observances.\\"<br /><br />Two ARCs on that stack for home were literally falling apart. One was Brenda Woods' EMAKO BLUE, which we just bought a new copy of for the classroom. It's been passed nonstop from kid to kid for a year now. The other, which from overuse is now a collection of loose pages nested in a cover, is Alex Flinn's FADE TO BLACK. Finally getting my own chance to read it last night, I had to grip it with two hands so that it wouldn't fall all over the room.<br /><br />\\"Night is when I think about dying. That's what I'm doing now, after midnight in the quiet hospital.\\"<br /><br />It didn't take long to see why Shari's students have been enthusiastically turning each other on to FADE TO BLACK since its arrival in the classroom in January. Central to the story is a hate crime involving a baseball bat and the shattered windows of an occupied automobile. There is a victim, Alex Crusan, a HIV-positive high school student whose family recently moved from Miami to the small town of Pinedale. There is a witness, Daria, a fellow high school student with Down Syndrome. Then there is a football player, also from Pinedale High, Clinton Cole. We learn quickly from Clinton himself that he'd thrown a rock through a window of the Crusan house the night before. Did Clinton also, as Daria tells police, attack Alex's car when Alex was stopped at a red light early on the morning of October 27th?<br /><br />What Alex Flinn does so well here is to create three realistic and complex teen characters, all of whom have some secrets. She also writes so articulately about the elephant in the room: the continued fear and ignorance in America surrounding HIV and AIDS.<br /><br />\\" 'They told us before he came here that you couldn't get sick, just being near him. But I don't believe it for a minute. I mean, what if he cuts himself? He doesn't have those purple, blotchy things you always see on people with AIDS on TV. But still, there's all these molecules and particles and things, junk in the air. And what about dust mites?' I remember once, they told us in science class that dust is all people's skin and junk. Excuse me, but I don't want that guy's skin particles on me.\\"<br /><br />In an exceptional article, \\"How a Young Adult Novelist Researches,\\" published in VOYA and accessible online at [...] , Alex discusses a 2003 Minnesota AIDS Project study \\"in which researchers found that 43 percent of those surveyed did not know or were uncertain about whether HIV could be transmitted through a cough or a sneeze, and 38 percent did not know or were uncertain whether it could be transmitted from a toilet seat.\\" Having done her homework, the author creates a consistent tone throughout the book that is revealing of the myths and the reality and how students are affected by them.<br /><br />\\"All the days<br /><br />after,<br /><br />he said hi<br /><br />just hi<br /><br />and I<br /><br />liked him.\\"<br /><br />Alex Flinn has been steadily gaining a reputation among adolescents for creating high interest, realistic YA fiction that incorporates issues that matter to them. FADE TO BLACK will continue the spread of that reputation. I've got a dismantled ARC as testimony of that.skin and junk.

Connection is love. Staying connected with Eddie Proffit is as good for me as it is for him, because love is as true on earth as it is in the farthest reaches of the universe.<br /><br />\\"So I do it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Just Do It.\\" --Nike slogan<br /><br />In KING OF THE MILD FRONTIER: AN ILL-ADVISED AUTOBIOGRAPHY, Chris Crutcher recognizes Michael Jordan as a hero--not for his legendary on-court accomplishments, but for the manner in which Michael responded to the brutal murder of his father. Chris notes of Michael:<br /><br />\\"When asked about his feelings for his father's killers or what should happen to them, in the only recount I ever heard, all he said was, 'My father is dead. That's all I care about.'\\"<br /><br />In rereading Crutcher's autobiography I continue to be moved by Michael's response. I'm so touched by it that one day I'm going to make a point of giving Michael a big long hug.<br /><br />It actually won't be \\"one day\\" since, according to Billy Bartholomew, there is no \\"time\\" where he now exists. Billy is the dead teenaged narrator of Chris Crutcher?s new novel THE SLEDDING HILL. And according to Billy Bartholomew, once me 'n Number 23 are both history I'll be able to hook up with Michael or anyone else who has come and \\"gone.\\"<br /><br />Life on Earth, as Billy explains it from his beyond-this-world perspective, is but a game, the Earthgame. Once you get to where he is, you \\"travel at the speed of imagination\\" and \\"laugh in wonder at all the crazy considerations you had while playing the Earthgame because you were so focused you thought things were important.\\"<br /><br />Nor are there emotions after death, Billy explains, other than a \\"pure joy of knowledge--and a sense of coming home.\\"<br /><br />What to many readers will be Billy's most shocking revelation from beyond the grave is that everyone who dies ends up IN THE SAME PLACE! That means me and James Dobson, Tucker Carlson, and Bull Conner are all going to get to spend eternity sharing the same celestial real estate with (formerly) practicing homosexuals and hippies, independent film makers, blasphemers, Bin Ladens, black people, and banned book authors.<br /><br />Chris Crutcher is a runner, as are so many of the characters he's created over the years. Crutcher's been spending a lot of his time lately running around the country defending his good name and his great books which are being challenged so frequently that you've got to figure there?s some serious hit list out there making its way to right-wing pulpits around the country.<br /><br />Of course, there's supposed to be a separation of Church and State, at least in theory. That wasn't the reality when it came to Crutcher's own childhood experiences--as he recounted in KING OF THE MILD FRONTIER--and it sure doesn't seem to be the case today if you?ve paid attention to as many recent articles about book bannings as I have.<br /><br />Many of the childhood stories of religion and death that Crutcher includes in his autobiography find their way into the plot of THE SLEDDING HILL. And if you've read the autobiography you realize there are going to be a bunch of huffing, puffing, scowling preachers when they start getting an earful of Billy Bartholomew.<br /><br />But they're going to have a bit of a problem deep-sixing this baby. Crutcher?s written a book without ANY \\"naughty\\" words. Not a single f-word, sh-word, n-word, b-word, or a-h word. If they want to ban THE SLEDDING HILL from school libraries, they're going to have to get it banned because of Billy Bartholomew?s blatantly blasphemous revelations.<br /><br />And that's the catch, because in Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District No.26 v. Pico, the landmark 1982 Supreme Court case concerning school-library censorship (I quote from Russell Freedman's IN DEFENSE OF LIBERTY: THE STORY OF AMERICA'S BILL OF RIGHTS.),<br /><br />\\"[T]he court held that students' rights were violated by removal of the books and said that a school library provides 'an environment especially appropriate for the recognition of First Amendment rights of students.' \\"School officials have a great deal of power to decide which books should be in their school libraries, but they ?may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books,' said the Court. 'Allowing a school board to engage in such conduct hardly teaches children to respect the diversity of ideas that is fundamental to the American system.' \\"<br /><br />Now along with the recent book banning news stories, there have been some pretty articulate words from certain teens who feel the same way about having their school libraries raped by the Religious Right as I felt about the Nixon White House invading the offices of the antiwar group I belonged to when I was their age.<br /><br />As recently explained so articulately in the Kansas City Star by a Kansas high school student named Sasha Mushegian,<br /><br />\\"It's true that some words and ideas should not be introduced to students who have not reached a certain level of maturity. But the amount of sheltering these parents are trying to accomplish is more appropriate for elementary school children than for people capable of earning wages, taking college-level courses and driving cars. These are all actions that require a degree of personal responsibility and capability of rational thought that these parents seem to think we lack.<br /><br />\\"Yes, we're not completely mature yet; sure, we often make bad decisions--but maturation is a process. There's no magical age at which we mentally and emotionally become adults.<br /><br />\\"How can you expect children to mature if you don't expose them to books in which reality is messy and confusing, morals are not immediately clear, making the right decision requires analysis of subtleties, and characters make the wrong choices? How do you expect students to think for themselves if you never expose them to situations that are challenging and unfamiliar (yet still safely contained within the pages of a great work of literature)?\\"<br /><br />I can easily see all this leading us toward another Supreme Court showdown to determine whether in reality we're a theocracy or a democracy.<br /><br />Then on the other hand, I can just imagine some overly-pierced, black-attired, parentally-oppressed young person reading all of this discussion, rolling his or her eyes, and impatiently wanting to know the important stuff:<br /><br />\\"Come on, Richie! Who the f--- cares what those right-wing a----s are b----ing about now? Just tell us whether the new Crutcher book is worth a sh--!\\"<br /><br />Okay, well, as a matter of fact it is. THE SLEDDING HILL caused me to laugh a lot, cry a little, and exercise some brain cells.<br /><br />\\"Everyone thought our friendship was odd; what was a smart kid like me doing hanging out with a kid with an IQ short of triple digits? Truth is, Eddie's IQ turned out to be off the charts. His mind bounces from one thing to the other pretty much however it wants, though, and long before he should be finishing up one thought, he's on to something else. Eddie doesn't come to very many conclusions.\\"<br /><br />Longtime friends Eddie Proffit and Billy Bartholomew like to run. It's the one thing that can keep Eddie's mind focused. But then--in a rather short period of time--Eddie discovers both his dad and his best friend Billy dead from totally random accidents. And things go downhill from there when Eddie's nemesis, the Reverend Tartar, starts hanging out with Eddie's grieving mom.<br /><br />Fortunately, Eddie discovers something that begins to help him get his mind around what has happened in his life.

But one of the things I loved most about that year of studying with an enthusiastic teacher who often made American history come alive for me was the series of quarterly independent projects we had to plan and complete. Each marking period we would have to do an American history-related visual piece as well as a written piece and an oral piece.<br /><br />\\"BY the flow of the inland river,<br /><br />Whence the fleets of iron have fled,<br /><br />Where the blades of the grave-grass quiver,<br /><br />Asleep are the ranks of the dead:<br /><br />Under the sod and the dew,<br /><br />Waiting the judgment-day;<br /><br />Under the one, the Blue,<br /><br />Under the other, the Gray.\\"<br /><br />Whence the fleets of iron have fled,<br /><br />Where the blades of the grave-grass quiver,<br /><br />Asleep are the ranks of the dead:<br /><br />Under the sod and the dew,<br /><br />Waiting the judgment-day;<br /><br />Under the one, the Blue,<br /><br />Under the other, the Gray.\\"<br /><br />That's the first of the seven verses of \\"The Blue and The Gray\\" by Francis Miles Finch (1827-1907). I memorized and proudly recited those seven verses to my American history class, and that memory has stuck with me.<br /><br />Having just celebrated my personal half-century mark, I'm all for turning around and returning to eighth-grade. And if I could do so, this is what I would memorize this time around for one of my oral pieces:<br /><br />\\"Pierced by the screams of a shortened childhood,<br /><br />my heartwood has been scarred for fifty years<br /><br />by what I heard, with hundreds of green ears.<br /><br />That jackal laughter. Two hundred years I stood<br /><br />listening to small struggles to find food,<br /><br />to the songs of creature life, which disappears<br /><br />and comes again, to the music of the spheres.<br /><br />Two hundred years of deaths I understood.<br /><br />Then slaughter axed one quiet summer night,<br /><br />shivering the deep silence of the stars.<br /><br />A running boy, five men in close pursuit.<br /><br />One dark, five pale faces in the moonlight.<br /><br />Noise, silence, back-slaps. One match, five cigars.<br /><br />Emmett Till's name still catches in the throat.\\"<br /><br />That is one of the fifteen sonnets that comprises A WREATH FOR EMMETT TILL by Marilyn Nelson. After reading the book to myself and then reading it aloud to Shari, my thoughts kept wandering off yesterday to brainstorming how I might somehow set up an event down in the City on Sunday, August 28th--fifty years to the day since Emmett was kidnapped--in which someone who would both have known the Civil Rights movement and whose presence could attract a major audience (a Danny Glover or a Bill Russell or someone else of that stature) would read this powerful series of poems aloud to a crowd to commemorate the anniversary of the brutal death of Emmett Till, a death which horrified the world and made clear what had gone on for so long.<br /><br />I can imagine having a choir and soloist perform at such an event, but definitely not a bunch of droning speakers whose verbosity might take away from the carefully chosen words of Marilyn Nelson's heroic crown of sonnets about Emmett Till. As Marilyn explains in her preface (HOW I CAME TO WRITE THIS POEM):<br /><br />\\"A crown of sonnets is a sequence of interlinked sonnets in which the last line of one becomes the first line, sometimes slightly altered, of the next. A heroic crown of sonnets is a sequence of fifteen interlocking sonnets, in which the last one is made up of the first lines of the preceeding fourteen.\\"<br /><br />Thus, it's like a literary crossword puzzle. Get one word wrong and it simply doesn't fit together. Get all the words exactly right and you've got something worthy of public performances by famous personalities and recitations by today's and tomorrow's American history students.<br /><br />Marilyn Nelson got it right.	2005-05-21

Books	5	8	8	N	N	Richie's Picks: CAPTAIN FACT SPACE ADVENTURE	Space, dinosaurs, bugs, mummies, and bodily functions. What topics could be more fascinating to guys when we're eight or nine or ten years old?<br /><br />A couple of nights ago, I ran into friends at Pine Crest, our district's school for third through fifth graders. We were attending the annual Open House, looking through student portfolios, admiring art projects, and checking out photos from the Civil War enactment that took place earlier in the year during the class field trip to Angel Island.<br /><br />When I asked what their son was currently enjoying reading, they told me that he actually wasn't much of a reader and hadn't been excited about anything since completing a FRINDLE year earlier.<br /><br />Having offered to try and dig out a few things at home that might interest him, I wandered around the house later, trying to spot Something New for a boy who (our fifth grade daughter confided) \\"won't stay in his seat\\" and \\"turns everything into a gun.\\" In short, a typical male action figure.<br /><br />UPS to the rescue!<br /><br />So, yesterday morning I'm sitting around reading a superb YA novel that I'll be reviewing soon, and the guy with the brown suit and the brown truck bounces up our long, bumpy driveway and drops off a thin package with the perfect new books for my friends' son.<br /><br />One hundred pages per episode, a cross between the good-hearted cartoon wackiness of CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS (Dav Pilkey is an absolute god at Pine Crest.) and the informationality of THE MAGIC TREE HOUSE, CAPTAIN FACT is about to become the latest version of the British Invasion.<br /><br />Cliff Thornhill is the world's worst TV weatherman. His sidekick Puddles is the world's only TV weatherdog. They have an incredibly overbearing boss who is always getting on their case for screwing up the weather report once again.<br /><br />But then:<br /><br />\\"As they returned to their office after meeting with the Boss, Cliff and Puddles noticed a huge crowd gathered around a TV screen.<br /><br />\\" 'There's a monkey on a collision course with Mars!' gasped Lucy, Cliff's friend from the Makeup department.<br /><br />\\" 'A monkey in space?' Cliff asked.<br /><br />\\" 'It's not just any monkey,' explained Lucy. 'That's Dr. Barnabas, the world's most intelligent primate. He's on a mission to explore Mars, and his spaceship, Ape-ollo 13, has been damaged. He's down to his last two bananas. He can't last much longer!'<br /><br />\\"Before Lucy could even finish her sentence, Cliff and Puddles had taken off.<br /><br />\\"Strange, thought Lucy. Cliff and Puddles always seem to disappear whenever there's a crisis...\\"<br /><br />They pull the lever, the portrait of Cliff's great-great-great uncle Sir Phineas Thornhill slides back revealing the secret tunnel, and the pair slide down a pole into the Fact Cave, where they transform into Captain Fact and Knowledge. Their paraphernalia is created by a guy named Professor Minuscule, whose young whiz-kid daughter, Factorella, is the unsung hero in the first adventure.<br /><br />As the adventures progress, Captain Fact regularly has one of a variety of sudden bodily complaints (\\"nose began to twitch,\\" \\"head began to throb,\\" \\"earlobes began to wobble\\") that inevitably lead to a \\"Fact Attack\\": a two page spread of cartoon-illustrated facts about an aspect of their mission.<br /><br />In checking out the Captain and his creators online, I discovered that there are already five episodes in print in Britain (encompassing the aforementioned topics). I also found a synopsis which elaborates on the gadget aspect:<br /><br />\\"His Fact Gun can fire off a thousand facts per minute. His Factmobile can fly, swim, burrow through mountains all in the name of facts. Not only that, he's got Fact Chewing Gum, Fact Cream and he can make a mean Fact Sandwich.\\"<br /><br />In each of the first two episodes we also learn important secret facts about the genesis of Captain Fact and Knowledge.<br /><br />Fact: guys (and probably some girls, too) are going to love reading and sharing the adventures of Captain Fact.(and probably some girls, too) are going to love reading and sharing the adventures of Captain Fact.  <br />	2005-05-21

I am named after Douglas MacArthur, the famous general, who was a second cousin of my father's great-aunt. Everyone on my father's side is named after some famous person we are supposedly related to. My father's name is Henry Clay Hanson. Henry Clay was a politician who died before the Civil War. He was my grandfather's cousin's great-uncle. Or something like that. It goes on and on. Since my grandfather's name was George Washington Hanson, I guess I'm related to the father of our country too. Anyway, I'm glad I got named after a general instead of a politician. I think it makes me sound more respectable.<br /><br />\\"Usually when I meet someone for the first time, I tell them my full and proper name. Then I say, 'But you can call me General.' Some people find this amusing. Andy always laughs. Sometimes he calls me General, just to tease me. I don't mind. I kind of like it.

And so she does.<br /><br />A great joy that accompanies a new book of poems by Naomi Shihab Nye is the expectation that she will begin reappearing at national conferences and conventions, reading aloud from her latest collection. The good feeling I've taken away with me from her past workshops is about as close as I get to church these days.<br /><br />A MAZE ME contains seventy-two of Naomi's latest poems. Younger teens will find these pieces easy to read and relate to. Hopefully, many will be intrigued and inspired by Naomi's ability to create poetry from such sources as a car manual, a newspaper article, a taco sign, \\"the hair on the head of the girl in front of me in school,\\" Julia Child's patting potatoes, or a vapor trail \\"X\\" that a pair of planes have inadvertently left in the sky.<br /><br />Being a book of \\"Poems for Girls\\" there are also the requisite handful of \\"longing\\" poems:<br /><br />\\"High Hopes<br /><br />It wasn't that they were so<br /><br />high, exactly,<br /><br />they were more<br /><br />low-down,<br /><br />close-to-the-ground,<br /><br />I could rub them<br /><br />the way you touch a cat<br /><br />that rubs against your ankles<br /><br />even if he isn't yours.<br /><br />So yes I feel lonely without them.<br /><br />Now that I know the truth,<br /><br />that I only dreamed someone liked me,<br /><br />the cat has curled up in a bed of leaves<br /><br />against the house and I still have to do<br /><br />everything I had to do before<br /><br />without a secret hum<br /><br />inside.\\"<br /><br />Despite being a guy, I really enjoyed the images and memories conjured up by these poems.

Price check on register three.' \\"<br /><br />Okay, who remembers Plaid Stamps?<br /><br />My earliest, late-Fifties memories of \\"the supermarket\\" involve the A&P in Plainview. I recall my fascination over the live lobsters in the fish tank, the strong smell around the coffee bean grinder, and the top end of that mysterious conveyer belt between two aisles that led up from the basement but which I never saw in use.<br /><br />These days, \\"the supermarket\\" for me is the rapidly expanding chain Trader Joe's which is a virtual twenty-first century hippie heaven with their everyday great deals on the private label California brown basmati rice, canola oil, clover honey, sprouted barley bread, frozen strawberries (for smoothies), and cashew pieces they offer, along with the TJ's spaghetti sauces, preserves, peanut butter, juices, and other processed products that are made without sugar or preservatives.<br /><br />On top of that, they're a pretty jovial crew who work there.<br /><br />But who ARE the people who work in a supermarket? What are their stories and their secrets?<br /><br />Let's start with Adam.<br /><br />Adam's entire life outside of school is the television in his bedroom. But now Adam's dad has forced him to abandon his afterschool shows to go interview for a part-time supermarket position. And Adam--through no fault of his own--has actually been hired.<br /><br />\\"The store manager was seated at his desk, as he had been the day before.<br /><br />\\" 'Graham Powell,' he said, shaking Adam's hand as if they had never met.<br /><br />\\" 'I'm Adam,' said Adam, just to be on the safe side. \\"Graham spun around in his chair, leaned down, and opened his bottom drawer.<br /><br />\\" 'Adam, Adam,' he repeated. 'I've got you in here somewhere.' \\"There were dozens of name tags in the drawer, but none of them had his name on it. Graham sorted through them all. Then he picked one out and showed it to Adam. It said ANDY.<br /><br />\\" 'How about you wear this one until we get yours made up?' \\" 'But that's not my name,' said Adam.<br /><br />\\" 'Not a problem.' Graham sounded slightly annoyed. 'It's mainly for the customers, you realize.'<br /><br />\\"Adam took the tag and pinned it to his shirt pocket. It was on an angle, but he didn't care.<br /><br />\\" 'Any questions?' asked Graham. 'Any concerns?'<br /><br />\\"It was a good opportunity to be rude, crude, stupid, or all three. But before Adam could say anything, Graham stood up and began shaking his hand again.<br /><br />\\" 'Welcome aboard,' he said. 'Come and I'll introduce you to the sharks!'<br /><br />\\"He led Adam to a smaller room with four desks. There were two men and two women seated at the desks, and Graham introduced Adam to them, one by one: Nicola, the dairy manager; Cameron, the fruit manager; Amanda, the grocery manager; and Scott, the trainee manage, who said, 'How are ya, bud?' as if he actually remembered him. Adam viewed each in turn, like changing channels on TV. Who would he have to offend, he wondered, and how, in order to be dismissed?\\"<br /><br />Shortly after beginning his first day on the job Adam hears someone softly crying in the next aisle over. It turns out to be the newly crowned Employee of the Month, a pretty teen checker named Louisa. The reoccurring episodes in the resulting tale of Adam (who forgets all about trying to get himself fired) and Louisa form the nucleus of SHELF LIFE, a brilliant series of interlocking stories about the idiosyncratic collection of characters (And I MEAN characters.) who work in this twenty-four-hour, seven-day-a-week supermarket.<br /><br />Those employees include Jared, the wild and crazy young man with the chemical imbalance, Rahel, the girl in the meat department who's from a traditional Islamic family, Chloe, the cashier who seems incapable of saying \\"No\\" to any man, Stephen, the kid whose reality is inside his Gameboy, Marco, the night watchman, and Gina, who is employed by an agencyto go to different supermarkets and serve up free samples.<br /><br />\\" 'Weevils?'<br /><br />\\"Abdi had never heard the word before.<br /><br />\\" 'Big fat ones, in the flour,' said Jared.

The trees in the orchard have just been destroyed by a major freeze, and the migrant couple are given their American dream opportunity: they get to buy the land at a price they can afford, replace the trees, and wait seven years for the first crop. In the meantime the father supports the family by working at the local citrus processing plant. The mom helps make ends meet by buying cheap, tacky clothes and cans of \\"surprise\\" food--the ones which the labels have dropped off of. And the kids have a healthy schedule of never-ending chores in order to make it all work.<br /><br />\\"Look over yonder, what do you see, the sun is a-rising, most definitely...\\"<br /><br />Living next door are a father and his two sons, the remaining members of a family who had escaped by sea from Cuba. The younger son is the brain-damaged Rooster.<br /><br />My reaction to ROOSTER is affected by my ability to relate to the main character, Kady, whose mid-1950's fictional birth was within a year of my own. The story, primarily set in 1969, is well ornamented with references to the clothing, music, TV commercials, and news of the day.<br /><br />But, to me, it is the background tale of Kady's parents which really drives the story. The way Kady \\"is\\" and the way she and her brother respond to the culture and consumerism surrounding them can only be understood when you understand the way they have been raised.<br /><br />\\"...I see the bad moon arising. I see trouble on the way. I see earthquakes and lightnin'. I see bad times today...\\"<br /><br />My first thoughts of ninth grade (1969) are Woodstock and the Chicago 7 trial. But to Kady's parents, 1969 is to be the long-awaited first commercial crop that their orchard will produce.<br /><br />Rooster has always called Kady his \\"madrina,\\" his godmother; he believes that Kady can always make everything okay. But Kady is coming of age and becomes girlfriend to the son of a wealthy Florida land developer. The main story here is what happens when Kady and Jon's careless young love affects everyone around them, especially Rooster.<br /><br />\\"What does it take to win your love for me? How can I make this dream come true for me?..\\"<br /><br />This is a marvelous tale with a wealth of drama, romance, humor, cruelty, drugs, and rock 'n roll. This first novel by Beth Nixon Weaver is a 12 and up which I see as acceptable for classroom use: The romance is sensual, not sexual--the content is limited to kissing and the ambiguous \\"making out.\\" Marijuana use is central to the story and is bound to be the catalyst for some important discussions.<br /><br />\\"...And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make...\\"erything okay.

Gray sheets of water tumbled from the sky, breaking upon the pavements with a roar louder than cannon fire.  A strong wind buffeted the rain this way and that, blowing it under porches and eaves, cornices and capstones, drowning each possible refuge with a freezing spray.  There was water everywhere, bouncing off the tarmac, swilling along the gutters, congregating in basement corners and above the drains.  It overflowed the city's cisterns.  It cascaded horizontally through pipes, diagonally across roof-slates, vertically down walls, staining the brickwork like sweeping washes of blood.  It dripped between joists and through cracks in ceilings.  It hung in the air in the form of a chill white mist, and above, invisibly, in the black reaches of the sky.  It seeped into the fabric of buildings and the bones of their cowering inhabitants.<br /><br />\\"In dark places underground, rats huddled in their lairs, listening to the echoes of the drumming overhead.  In humble houses, ordinary men and women closed the shutters, turned lights full on and clustered about their hearth-fires with steaming cups of tea.  Even in their lonely villas, the magicians fled the endless rain.  They skulked to their workrooms, bolted fast the iron doors and, conjuring clouds of warming incense, lost themselves in dreams of distant lands.<br /><br />\\"Rats, commoners, magicians: all safely undercover.  And who could blame them?  The streets were deserted, all London was shut down.  It was close to midnight and the storm was getting worse.<br /><br />\\"No one in their right mind would be out on a night like this.\\"<br /><br />But, of course, everyone's favorite wise-ass, shape-shifting djinni is stuck out in the rain.  Nathaniel, who is now a few years older, much more arrogant, and now calling himself John Mandrake, has dragged Bartimaeus back to work in London.<br /><br />It took me quite a while to finally get to work reading THE GOLEM'S EYE.<br /><br />Bulldozing my way through mountains of books in preparation for the just-concluded Best Books for Young Adults committee meetings in Boston this week, I repeatedly shunted aside this 550+ paged middle volume in Johnathan Stroud's Bartimaeus trilogy.  This, despite the fact that the first book (THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND) was my favorite fantasy of 2003.  But being responsible for thoroughly reading as many BBYA nominations as possible--and there were 214 nominations this time around--I focused on building up my \\"Books Read\\" total and saved Bartimaeus for the final week before the meetings.<br /><br />It turns out that I saved one of the best for last.<br /><br />Danger, action, mystery, evil, and humor, (and occasionally a lot of rain) make THE GOLEM'S EYE a fantastic fantasy.  But the eloquent vocabulary, vivid and melodic descriptions, significant themes, and Orwellian overtones make this a profound piece of Young Adult literature.<br /><br />With the publication of THE GOLEM'S EYE, Jonathan Stroud demonstrates emphatically that his name deserves to be spoken in the same breath as J. K. Rowling and Philip Pullman.  And in the same way that I don't take anything away from the life-altering experience of first reading the advance copy of the HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE by contending that HP3 was a better written book than HP1, I take nothing away from the genius of AMULET OF SAMARKAND by noting that Mr. Stroud has thoroughly surpassed his previous effort in writing his second book of the trilogy.<br /><br />THE GOLEM'S EYE features Kitty Jones, a young commoner who made a brief but memorable appearance in AMULET.  Stroud reveals the story of Kitty's recruitment into the Resistance after she and her childhood friend Jakob are thoroughly (and nearly fatally) wronged by a prominent magician in the government.  It is the damaged, self-absorbed, and full of himself teenaged Nathaniel who is assigned the task of playing cat-and-mouse with the Resistance when a massive mud man cloaked in a black cloud begins wreaking massive death and destruction amidst several of London's prime tourist destinations.<br /><br />The political commentary in which Stroud's story is immersed makes this book worthy of in-depth study by high school students, just as the thrilling story on its face will totally suck in younger readers.<br /><br />One of the most memorable aspects of THE GOLEM'S EYE involve the scenes in which the enslaved Bartimaeus meets and gets to know Kitty, the oppressed commoner.  Kitty is changed as a result of their philosophical conversations.  (The question is how will Kitty influence Bartimaeus in the third book of the trilogy.)  The astute reader will leave the book questioning the use of violence, the means to an end, and how power corrupts.<br /><br />I almost envy those of you who haven't yet read THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND and have the opportunity to thoroughly immerse yourselves in the first two volumes of Jonathan Stroud's alternative London.sive mud man cloaked in a black cloud begins wreaking massive death and destruction amidst several of London's prime tourist destinations. <br /> <br />The political commentary in which Stroud's story is immersed makes this book worthy of in-depth study by high school students, just as the thrilling story on its face will totally suck in younger readers.  <br /> <br />One of the most memorable aspects of THE GOLEM'S EYE involve the scenes in which the enslaved Bartimaeus meets and gets to know Kitty, the oppressed commoner.

The powerful and achingly tragic story Sammy recounts of Juliana and that summer is but a mere preface in this stunning ode to growing up in the barrio--a neighborhood that some joker has named Hollywood.  I alternately laughed, cheered, and cried as Sammy and his Hollywood friends encounter the prejudices, the Church, the hormones, the War, the drugs, the violence, the music, the aspirations, and the dress code, while making their way through that year both inside and outside of the barrio.  If I had to choose a single \\"top\\" book from the 200+ new books for teens that I've read in 2004, SAMMY & JULIANA IN HOLLYWOOD would be the one.	2004-12-03

During the day, hat from the Sun pours onto Earth's surface.  Land absorbs the heat, while water reflects most of the Sun's rays back into the air.  As the air warms, it becomes lighter and rises up into the atmosphere (the \\"bubble\\" of air that surrounds the planet.)  Heavier cool air from nearby is sucked in along the ground to fill the void.  The movement of this cooler air is what we feel as wind.\\"<br /><br />With a combination of simple explanation and significant information, Christine Petersen examines the nature of wind and how it has been harnessed for our energy needs beginning with Egyptian boating 7,000 years ago.<br /><br />\\"In 2001, wind farms around the world produced enough electricity for 10 million homes.\\"<br /><br />Wind Power is filled with photographs of windmills, wind turbines, and wind farms.  An up-to-date website list of relevant organizations is included at the end of the book.  The wealth of information provided and the manner in which it is presented while keeping it entirely age-appropriate is so outstanding here that I found myself compelled to reject another publisher's 2004 book on wind power (while working on collection development) because it suffered so badly in comparison from reading it after enjoying this one.	2004-10-29

Here, the scorching heat causes hydrogen atoms to move constantly.  Some of the atoms slam together and stick, in a process called nuclear fusion.  Fusion changes hydrogen into a heavier atom, helium.  Along the way, energy is released as heat and light.  Energy created by fusion inside the Sun streams out in every direction.  Light travels through space like waves on the ocean--but much faster.  From the time the light leaves the Sun, it takes just over eight minutes to reach Earth.<br /><br />\\"Earth absorbs only about one-billionth of the heat and light released by the Sun.\\"<br /><br />Some might mistakenly assume that a heavily-illustrated 48 page book set in large type would not have much depth.  Not only does Petersen explain the science of solar power being an essential part of life and fossil fuels, but she goes on to discuss solar energy technologies.  Admirably, she gives significant weight to passive solar heating (which is shortchanged in many comparable books) and domestic solar hot water heating systems, before delving into the large scale high tech systems and out-in-space systems.	2004-10-29

I don't mean the Orthodox with their hats and curled sideburns.  I mean the ones in normal clothes.  I recognize them by how they walk.  The Jews always stay close to the building walls.  Or near the gutter.  Even though it isn't written anywhere that they should.  And they always look down.  As though they are looking for something on the ground.  And there's always this embarrassed smile.  As if they wanted to beg pardon for something.  No Germans walk in that crept-inside-themselves way.\\"<br /><br />--Daniel's cousin Miriam, writing a letter in 1935.<br /><br />Two young friends in Hamburg, Germany become blood brothers while spending a night in jail.  They've been caught painting swastikas in the Communist sector of town in 1933, shortly before the rise of Adolf Hitler.  Daniel, the son of a wealthy attorney, and Armin, a poor scholarship student, attend an elite high school together.  Little do either know, as the pair are first dabbling in hatred and imagining belonging to the HJ (Hitler Youth), that Daniel's parents will soon reveal to him that his mother is actually Jewish.<br /><br />\\"Daniel looked at his father.  'Why did you do it?' he asked.  'Why did you marry a Jewess?'<br /><br />Rheinhard stared at him.  'Why I did what?'<br /><br />That's why I'm half Jewish now,' Daniel said.  'Because you married a Jewess.'<br /><br />Rheinhard didn't answer.  He gave David a look that hurt more than the smack in the face he gave him next.\\"<br /><br />Desperately trying to keep his horrible secret from everyone including Armin, Daniel is furious when his cousin Miriam shows up to live with them after her father (Daniel's mother's brother) is taken into custody.  And although his father's honored position as a decorated German W.W.I veteran allows Daniel's tenuous continuation at school, Daniel slowly is forced to internalize the position in which he has found himself:<br /><br />\\"I'm the lowest.  That's how I felt.  Someone you don't even greet.  A nothing.<br /><br />\\"And suddenly everything that I'd been keeping at a distance burst in on me: all the fear, all the shame, all the humiliation.  I just stood there, on the sidewalk, in front of some store window as people walked by me.  I stood in their way, got shoved, and a short man with a hat on said, 'Look out,' when it was he who should have looked out.<br /><br />\\"And in that moment I knew hatred.  I followed my erstwhile teammates with my eyes, and I hated every one of them.  I imagined running up to the bunch, grabbing Klaus, spinning him around, letting him have it--in the face with my fist.  Till the blood gushed out.<br /><br />\\"But my hand didn't hurt him.  Every blow I dealt him hurt him not at all, hurt only me.  It hurt so much, I tried with all my might to obliterate this scene, erase it from my mind.\\"<br /><br />It is ultimately Armin's attraction to Miriam that threatens the lives of Daniel's extended family, because Armin is a rising star in the HJ--which he's joined against his father's wishes--and Armin is being carefully watched.<br /><br />\\"Dr. Knoppe raised his eyes and voice.  'The dishonorable, dirty Jew looks with envy on the noble Nordic-German people.  And inside every Jew there dwells a diabolic need to drag the noble race down into the muck with him.  No reasonable farmer would ever allow such interbreeding of cattle!  But among humans, to our shame, it happens every day.' \\"<br /><br />An intimate perspective on the insanity faced by a young Jew during the rise of Hitler (1933-39), DANIEL HALF HUMAN AND THE GOOD NAZI also examines the dusky recesses of that long-term relationship between Daniel and Armin.  What, for me, was a startling conclusion to the story will surely leave readers dwelling upon their own ideas of friendship.riendship.  <br />	2004-10-28

It stared at Chalkhill with black, beady eyes from the bottom of a heated glass tank.\\"<br /><br />I'm generally resistant to writing about sequels.  Indeed, I oftentimes procrastinate as far as reading them myself.  If I've done my best to persuade readers to check out a great book, I figure they'll either want to read the sequel when it appears or they won't.<br /><br />\\"It didn't sound too bad to Chalkhill.  'What do I do?  Keep the worm with me in my pocket?  Something of that sort?'<br /><br />\\"The Facemaster hesitated.  'Ah...not exactly.  The symbiote must be absorbed into your body.'<br /><br />\\"Chalkhill's jaw dropped.  'I have to swallow it?'<br /><br />\\"The Facemaster shook his head.  'Human saliva is toxic to the species.  Consequently the insertion must be made in one nostril.  The worm slides down your throat, crawls through the stomach into the large intestine, thence to the small intestine and, ultimately. the bowel, where it takes up permanent residence in your bottom.' \\"<br /><br />Sounds uncomfortable, but it is actually that worm's butting in on Chalkhill's thoughts and conversations once it's taken up residence in his south end that becomes the bane of his despicable existence:<br /><br />\\"Do be quiet, be quiet, be quiet! Chalkhill screamed inside his skull.  The worm had talked non-stop from the moment it was inserted.  If it went on very much longer, he was going to go mad.  'Why won't this thing shut up?' he asked the Facemaster.<br /><br />\\" 'The worm?  They do that, I'm afraid.  Most people get used to it eventually.'<br /><br />\\" 'Most people?' Chalkhill echoed.  'What about the ones who don't?'<br /><br />\\" 'They usually hang themselves.'<br /><br />\\" 'Which creates an interesting legal dilemma,' said the worm in Chalkhill's mind, having clearly eavesdropped on the spoken conversation.  'Should one bring a charge of suicide or murder?  There are those lawyers who hold that the symbiotic relationship creates, in effect, a new entity, in which case hanging must be deemed an act of suicide.  But there are others who would argue that the two sentient entities--wangaramas wyrm and faerie--remain distinct, if interlinked, in which case the suicide of one involves the murder of the other.  In Jessup v. Trentonelf, however, Lord Justice Bedstraw ruled on the possibility of collusion by the wangaramas, which raises the spectre of assisted suicide, an offence in itself which, while carrying a lesser penalty than first degree murder, will nonetheless--'<br /><br />\\" 'Can't they just have the worm removed?' asked Chalkhill, desperately ignoring the inner monologue.  'Can't I just have the worm removed?' He could just possibly survive until he slaughtered Pyrgus at his Coronation, but after that he wanted the worm out again within the hour.\\"<br /><br />Sadly for Chalkhill, the removal procedure takes six months.  And sadly for you--if you haven't yet read FAERIE WARS--you've got some serious catching up to do before you can discover what other advice that wascally Wangaramas Worm named Cyril offers his new partner, Chalkhill.<br /><br />If you HAVE already read FAERIE WARS,you'd know all about the secret ingredient in the glue and why Chalkhill deserves such a fate.  You'd know about the Realm and about the adventures of Pyrgus Malvae, Holly Blue, Henry Atherton, and Mr. Fogerty, whose irascible, down-to-earth manner continues to make him the most unlikely character that I've ever met in a fantasy.

Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.'<br /><br />\\"And if America is to be a great nation this must become true.

From every mountainside, let freedom ring...\\"<br /><br />--Martin Luther King, Jr., August 28, 1963<br /><br />Dr. King must surely have had a thought or two of Marian Anderson as he stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on that historic afternoon and delivered those words.<br /><br />Many of us know Marian's basic story:<br /><br />Marian Anderson was a helluva singer.<br /><br />Despite being celebrated in Europe as the voice of a century, and despite having the strong support of the President's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, Marian Anderson was denied the opportunity to perform in Constitution Hall in Washington, DC because it was owned by the Daughters of the American Revolution, and those ladies didn't allow no black folks to be singing in their hall.  That refusal led to Marian performing instead from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for a crowd of 75,000 people on the Mall and a nationwide radio audience.<br /><br />She stood up tall where Martin would stand a quarter-century later and led off her performance with a rendition of My County 'Tis of Thee.<br /><br />Her performance is seen as a historic event at the dawn of the modern Civil Rights movement.<br /><br />Two years ago, Pam Munoz Ryan and Brian Selznick created the stunningly beautiful 40 page picture book, WHEN MARIAN SANG (Scholastic Press, 2002), which won all sorts of awards including a Sibert Honor.<br /><br />Now Russell Freedman has written a beautiful and more detailed biography of Marian Anderson which will similarly captivate readers with its engaging text and its clear, oversized photographs of the singer herself and of supporting characters in the story of Marian Anderson.<br /><br />The most precious of those supporters were also some of the earliest.  Through the chapters focusing on her earliest years, I was moved by Freedman's portrayal of how Marian's childhood community came through time and time again to insure that her dreams would not be in vain:<br /><br />\\"Again there was no money for lessons.  Most of Marian's earnings from concert appearances went to her mother, who was still taking in laundry and scrubbing floors, and to her sisters, who were still in school.  And again the congregation at Union Baptist Church came to Marian's aid, organizing a benefit concert that raised $566 so that she could study with Boghetti.\\"<br /><br />Equally moving is the subplot of her life that involves Orpheus Fisher:<br /><br />\\"I don't wanna wait in vain for your love\\"  --Bob Marley<br /><br />Having had to quit school after eighth grade in the wake of her father's death, Marian did not complete high school until she was twenty-four.  It was during her delayed high school years--back when America was engaged in the First World War--that Marian met Orpheus Fisher who, \\"like her, was still in high school.  He fell for the shy singer with the soft laughter and huge sparkling eyes who was almost as tall as he...\\"<br /><br />Decades later, America was midway through the Second World War when Marian finally relented and married Orpheus, who has tirelessly and faithfully pursued her all those years, while she was single-mindedly focused on her career.<br /><br />And what a career it was:<br /><br />\\"During one ten-month period she gave 123 concerts in fifteen different countries, performing a repertoire that included over two hundred songs and arias in German, Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, and other languages.\\"<br /><br />It must have been amazingly disheartening for Marian Anderson to return home from entertaining European royalty and once again come face to face with Jim Crow.  Like black sports stars of that era, Marian faced dangerous and humiliating conditions when traveling and performing around some regions of our \\"sweet land of liberty.\\"  And yet, in photos, she appears both to have left that all behind and to be channeling some kind of higher power as she sings.<br /><br />\\" 'It was music-making that probed too deep for words.' \\"<br /><br />Marian Anderson remains a symbol of the historic fight to let freedom ring for all Americans.

Hey, that's music to my ears!<br /><br />\\"Now we were walking up from the lot when we heard music, of all things.<br /><br />\\"It stopped us cold. We'd never heard music hanging like haze over the blue evening. I recalled the calliope on the Case Special, trilling down the track. But we were miles from the railroad, and this was a full orchestra, with violins.\\"<br /><br />Back when I was a kid, we bought our music on vinyl and played it on phonographs. As long as I can remember, I've always had an ear tuned to the newest songs on the radio, and there were hundreds of tunes with which I passionately fell in love. I would hop on my Huffy banana bike and pedal down to the store so that I could add to my stacks of 45s. (They had one song on each side.)<br /><br />In contrast to someone's absolutely exquisite single--say Junior Walker's \\"What Does it Take to Win Your Love For Me\\" or (more recently) The Church's \\"Under the Milky Way\\"--it was rare to discover whole albums, or even whole sides of albums, that were consistently exceptional.<br /><br />As would make sense, I can say that the artists who created those albums that I loved all the way from one end to the other became my favorite bands. That's what The Beatles' LPs always did for me. It was the same with the Moody Blues. Bowie did it with Ziggy Stardust, Zappa with We're Only in it for the Money, Kantner with Blows Against the Empire, Todd Rundgren with Another Live. (I still savor sitting up front at his Wollman Rink show when he was recording it.) The Dead did it over and over and over again. (This is fun!) How about More Songs about Buildings and Food or My Aim is True? Queen did it with A Night at the Opera, Suzanne Vega with Solitude Standing, Ani with Not A Pretty Girl.<br /><br />Those are the thoughts that come to mind as I write, yet again, about the work of Richard Peck. This time it is in regard to his fifth straight novel set entirely or partly around the earlier portions of the 20th century. And what I think is this: Putting those five books together would sure make one heck of an LP.<br /><br />\\"On one of the Fridays, Little Britches said she'd learned a poem by heart and wanted to give it as her party piece for Elocution. So Tansy let her, and we all settled back to listen as Little Britches sashayed to the center of the rostrum, gathered her hands, and elocuted in a high voice that rang like a little bell:<br /><br />Adder in the desk drawer,<br /><br />Aunt Fanny in the ditch;<br /><br />Life here at Hominy Ridge<br /><br />Surely is a---<br /><br />\\"With an almighty thwack, Tansy brought her pointer down on the desk. Little Britches jumped.<br /><br />\\" 'Who taught you that so-called verse?'<br /><br />\\"Little Britches pointed me out and said, 'Russell Culver.' \\"<br /><br />In 1904 Russell Culver is a fifteen-year-old farm boy living in rural Indiana, and is one of a half-dozen or so students readying for another year at Hominy Ridge School, when their mean, old teacher Miss Myrt Arbuckle up and dies.<br /><br />\\"If your teacher has to die, August isn't a bad time of year for it. You know August. The corn is earring. The tomatoes are ripening on the vine. The clover's in full bloom. There's a little less evening now, and that's a warning. You want to live every day twice over because you'll be back in the jailhouse of school before the end of the month.\\"<br /><br />Hoping that perhaps they'll just close the school down, dreaming and scheming about taking off and riding the rails to Nebraska for the fall harvest in October, the last thing Russell expects to happen is for his big sister, Tansy, to not go away for her last year of high school as planned but, instead, to become their new teacher.<br /><br />\\"The thought of Tansy having a look at my orthography brought me near to tears. It was almost the last thing you'd want a sister looking at.\\"<br /><br />THE TEACHER'S FUNERAL gives readers a look at the dawn of the automobile age. There's a noticeable difference in the America of Russell Culver from that--just twelve years later--of Howard Leland Hutchings, the fifteen-year-old we encounter in Richard Peck's last novel, the award-winning THE RIVER BETWEEN US.<br /><br />But on the other hand, THE TEACHER'S FUNERAL has got a groove that fits right in with Peck's previous four novels: the humor, the chores, the vittles, the multigenerational cast of the good, the bad, and the ornery. And there's something about the way Richard Peck portrays his rural settings that makes me want to go stand outside in my goat pasture and breathe deeply.<br /><br />\\"Me and Lloyd were up ahead of the chickens.

We were the exhibit.' \\"<br /><br />On Saturday night, October 20, 1973, during my first semester at UConn, I accompanied some of my new friends to an on-campus screening of Andy Warhol's Trash. It is an evening that I will never forget, although its significance has only partially to do with Warhol's raunchy \\"artistic\\" film, whose cast was immortalized in Lou Reed's \\"Walk on the Wild Side.\\"<br /><br />\\" 'Scripts bore me. It's much more exciting not to know what's going to happen.' \\"<br /><br />On our way to the theater, my friends detoured by way of a subterranean eatery on the south end of campus. Back then, the establishment was still adorned in original '50s dark leatherette, accompanied by chrome, pennants, mirrors, and a soda fountain. Parking me in a corner while they ordered themselves some slices, I zoned in on the radio as the music was interrupted by a news bulletin: President Nixon had just forced Attorney General Richardson and Assistant Attorney General Ruckelshaus to resign after their refusals to fire Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. Solicitor General Bork then proceeded to do the deed for Tricky Dick, and I proceeded to experience a surreal evening of having my eyes aimed at a screenful of junkies, prostitutes, and transvestites, while my mind kept repeating hysterically, \\"No! He can't do that! No! He can't do that!\\"<br /><br />(Robert Bork later got his second fifteen minutes of fame, as a failed Reagan Supreme Court nominee, and continues to get an additional five or ten seconds each time I explain to middle school classes the origin of Rodman Philbrick's phraseology, \\"That really borks me off,\\" when we read them THE LAST BOOK IN THE UNIVERSE.)<br /><br />But I seriously digress.<br /><br />\\" 'Now and then people would accuse me of being evil--of letting people destroy themselves while I watched, just so I could film or tape record them,' Andy said. 'But I learned when I was little that whenever I got aggressive and tried to tell someone what to do, nothing happened. I just couldn't carry it off.' \\"<br /><br />In the long run it can be argued that Andy Warhol and his complex life became much larger than his art. But the rise of Andy Warhol was the result of a simple and logical progression.<br /><br />An artistic son of eastern European immigrants grows up to become a successful commercial artist.<br /><br />\\"Pittsburgh was far from New York, but the lessons Andy had learned in his hometown--work hard and work fast--were already serving him well.\\"<br /><br />A commercial artist is someone who is creating interesting and appealing images of products for sale. And the slight, pale, hardworking subject of this book was an absolute master at it. So when a new art movement coincidentally appeared--Pop Art--that involved the incorporation of everyday objects and newspaper images in paintings, who would have been a more likely person to rise and become the prince of that movement than this true master of commercial art?<br /><br />And who better to tell the fascinating life story of such a controversial artist and cryptic individual than that dynamic duo of artist biographers, Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan?<br /><br />\\"For months Andy had been working hard, trying to find a subject to paint that was both fresh and visually stimulating.\\"<br /><br />The authors do a terrific job of conveying the tension that filled Warhol's determined quest to evolve from successful commercial artist to successful artist. Without that pivotal transition, of course, we wouldn't be talking about Andy Warhol forty-something years later.<br /><br />\\"Eventually he painted a six-foot-tall Coke bottle--the curvy shape reproduced straightforwardly, larger than life, with the seriousness of high art. It was a breakthrough for him. Did he intend the Coke bottle as a still life or a satire on the female figure in painting? Certainly Andy never stopped to interpret his artwork; he was just trying to reinvent himself as a serious artist.\\"<br /><br />But, what's the story of his choosing the Campell's soup can? How did that happen?<br /><br />\\"During this period, Andy fell into a depression. His mother constantly nagged him to send more money home to his brothers and their growing families in Pittsburgh. He felt torn between the financial security of commercial art and his ambition to be a great artist. He lay in bed, suffering from panic attacks. Afraid his heart would stop beating if he fell asleep, he would stay up all night talking on the phone to friends. It was on the telephone that he was most verbal, loving to hear gossip about celebrities and stories of his friends' love lives. Andy begged anybody and everybody for ideas. His friends grew used to hearing him moan. 'What should I paint?' They made plenty of suggestions, but nothing seemed right to him.<br /><br />\\"Then one night at a party, he asked his usual question, only to receive an unusual response. Muriel Latow, an art consultant, said, 'I can give you an idea, but it's gonna cost you fifty dollars.' Latow had such a bright, sassy point of view that Andy believed she might well come up with a startling suggestion. He pulled out his checkbook.<br /><br />\\" 'What do you like most in the world?' she asked him. 'You like money, you should paint that. And you should paint something that everybody sees everyday...like cans of soup.'<br /><br />\\"Andy wrote her a check on the spot.\\"<br /><br />And the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />\\" 'Publicity is like eating peanuts, once you start you can't stop.' \\"<br /><br />Guiding us through his studio, the galleries, parties, film sets, and multimedia presentations; from his near-assassination to the back room of Max's Kansas City, the authors provide an eye-opening look at the art scene and The Scene that Warhol created and nurtured. Years after his death, Andy Warhol's historic images of American icons continue to play a role in our pop culture.

Boy took the man's hand gratefully...\\"<br /><br />THE BOOK OF DEAD DAYS has nothing whatsoever to do with Jerry Garcia. Nevertheless, you'll find yourself tiptoeing amidst a rather healthy crop of skeletons if you dare to follow a pair of young orphans, and a magician on his last legs, as they race the clock through the dark recesses of a fantastical old European city in the final, frigid days of a year set on the verge of the modern scientific era.<br /><br />\\"He climbed out and stood for a moment in the wings, rubbing his sore calves and watching as Valerian began his grand finale.<br /><br />\\"The Fairyland Vanishing Illusion.<br /><br />\\"Boy was not needed for this part of the act. He watched Valerian from the side of the stage.<br /><br />\\"How many times has he done this? Boy wondered. He had forgotten how long he had been working for Valerian, but it was years. Boy could only guess at how many thousand times he had hidden in boxes, pulled levers, set off thunder flashes and opened trapdoors. He helped Valerian with trick after trick, week after week in the Great Theater, which was as much of a home as anywhere to Boy.\\"<br /><br />The \\"dead days\\" of the title are those five or so days of the year that mess up what would otherwise be a neat and orderly calendar of twelve 30-day months. Both the ancient Egyptians and the Aztecs shoved those leftover days into an ominous no-man's land at the end of their calendar year.<br /><br />THE BOOK OF DEAD DAYS is a tense drama in which Valerian seeks to save himself in those last days before the tolling of the new year, by tracking down a powerful old book that is somewhere hidden away. In the process, we are led through the underseams of some of the most claustrophobic settings that I've encountered.<br /><br />It was, in fact, from a rather small hiding place that the orphan, known only as Boy, had fallen many years earlier when he first came eye to eye with the magician:<br /><br />\\"Small, cramped dark spaces had filled Boy's life. Long ago, he had even been hiding in one the day he was found by Valerian in an old church, St. Colette's. Boy had crammed his narrow frame into a space at the top of a pillar in the nave...<br /><br />\\"Even then Valerian looked haggard and pale. His nose, long and fine, twitched in the dusty atmosphere of the old church. His skin was gray, so was his hair. He looked like a dead man walking. But his blue eyes were full of life, and his gaze roamed the dark spaces around him.<br /><br />\\"Then Boy had heard his midnight rumble of a voice, so deep the stone he was clinging to shivered with it.<br /><br />\\" 'The doctor,' intoned Valerian, 'pronounced me either dangerously sick or dead.'<br /><br />\\"It was while trying to understand the strangeness of those words that Boy lost his grip and plummeted to the flag floor of the church, where he lay looking up at Valerian, scratching his nose nervously, his short-cropped black hair sticking up at interesting angles the way it always did.<br /><br />\\" 'O-ho!' Valerian had said. 'What have we here?' \\"<br /><br />Now this unusual pair embark on a life-and-death search through, beneath, and around the outskirts of that City. Accompanied by Willow, an assertive young woman who falls in with them during these Dead Days, they are alternately aided and impeded by Kepler, a brilliant inventor who has been an acquaintance of Valerian's since their years together at the Academy, The unceasing echo of the clock ticking dictates that false moves be avoided, and that the horrors encountered be taken in stride.<br /><br />\\"He looked down at what lay within, and his jaw dropped. He had listened intently to what the old woman in the pillar had said about the Master of Burials and his animals, but nothing could have prepared him for what he saw now.\\"<br /><br />THE BOOK OF DEAD DAYS will leave you bent over breathless and back aching as you try to adjust to the light in hopes of determining just where you are now. And once you catch your wind and your bearings, you'll be wondering impatiently just how long the wait is before we get to return to the City in Book Two.S will leave you bent over breathless and back aching as you try to adjust to the light in hopes of determining just where you are now.

And out there, heading our way, was Mr. DiAngelo's new red kayak.\\"<br /><br />Brady Parks is a hardworking thirteen-year-old son of a Chesapeake Bay waterman. He and his two longtime friends, Digger and J.T., are waiting for their ride to school one April morning when they see that red kayak go by in the distance.<br /><br />\\"Cupping his hands around his mouth, Digger pretended to call out: 'Paddle hard, you sucker!'<br /><br />\\"He and J.T. exchanged this look I didn't quite catch, and J.T. started laughing, too.<br /><br />\\"But I shook my head. 'He shouldn't be going out there today. When he gets down to the point--he'll fly down the river.' I was sure Mr. DiAngelo didn't know about how the wind picked up once you left our creek and hit the open water. Not to mention the spring tides. Sometimes they were so strong they'd suck the crab pot buoys under. I doubted whether Mr. DiAngelo knew that; he'd only had the kayak a few weeks.<br /><br />\\" 'Really, guys. We ought to yell something,' I said soberly.\\"<br /><br />Although he's quite fond of the man's wife and little boy, Ben, for whom he's baby-sat, Brady and his friends are not fans of Mr. Marcellus DiAngelo, who has bought Digger's grandfather's farm, replaced the old farmhouse with a mansion, and eliminated the boys' access to the surrounding lands where they've always been able to play, and which Digger had always used as a getaway from his abusive dad.<br /><br />\\"Sneering, Digger stuffed his hands in his pockets. 'Look Brady, if he's stupid enough to be out there today, he can take what's coming. Besides, he deserves it.' \\"<br /><br />So they don't call out a warning.<br /><br />And then later that morning, when his father comes to take him out of school to assist with search efforts, Brady learns that it was actually Mrs. DiAngelo, taking Ben out for a ride, who had been paddling the red kayak in those frigid waters. Thus begins Brady's moral journey through this action-filled page turner.<br /><br />Brady's rescue and resuscitation of Ben makes Brady a hero for a day--until Ben dies from the effects of his exposure. Brady's friends distance themselves from him, and he is left alone with the secrets of the trio's actions and inactions.<br /><br />\\"My mind sure was drifting. Looking back, I could see there were things we three did that I would never forget. Boy, like the day we were playing ice hockey and I went through the ice on that cow pond. It was Digger who saved my life. I can still see him sprawled toward me, his chin bleeding, his tooth chipped forever, reaching both of his bare, cold hands out to me while I thrashed around in that freezing water and couldn't get a grip because the edges of the ice kept breaking. 'Grab on, Brady! Grab on!' And J.T. in the background, holding Digger's ankles so he wouldn't go down with me.\\"<br /><br />The long-term process that Brady navigates in his attempts at discovering \\"the right thing to do\\" is paralleled by that of Brady's dad. Mr. Parks is seeking a solution to his own problems involving decreasing income due to the dwindling inventories of crabs in the Chesapeake fishery. Dad must decide whether or not to participate in the political actions being organized by his fellow watermen who are calling for less restrictions on their crab harvesting.<br /><br />\\"Pressure pushing down on me<br /><br />Pressing down on you no man ask for<br /><br />Under pressure that brings a building down<br /><br />Splits a family in two<br /><br />Puts people on streets\\"<br /><br />--David Bowie/Queen, \\"Under Pressure\\"<br /><br />Another parallel involves the loss by Brady's family--prior to the story--of his little sister Amanda from SIDS.

But it didn't start out that way, and I wondered while I poked at the scrambled eggs Mom had made whether it was something I just had to get used to first, like a new haircut.\\"<br /><br />RED KAYAK provides a winning balance between the outdoor action and settings, and Brady's inner turmoil. From the muck on the crab traps to Brady's yellow lab tearing through the tall grass to retrieve a ball, the descriptions brought me gladly back to locales I've previously explored with the likes of Dicey Tillerman and Tunes Smith.

The mole whose story has meant the most to me is the hopeful and persistent character in David McPhail's MOLE MUSIC. Then there is that most gracious host to tired little bunnies in the Barbara Cooney-illustrated SEVEN LITTLE RABBITS. (The music cassette accompanying that book is forever imprinted on my brain after my having played it as part of several thousand naptimes during my former preschool career.)<br /><br />There is, in fact, a whole delightful assortment of moles in children's literature. But I'm seeing the mole (Condylura cristata) in a whole new light after being enchanted by the subterranean-dwelling \\"little gentleman in black velvet\\" who is at the center of Philippa Pearce's latest book.<br /><br />\\"...Mole he is burrowing<br /><br />his way to the sunlight<br /><br />He knows there's someone there so strong...\\"<br /><br />--Moody Blues, \\"Watching and Waiting\\"<br /><br />Bet lives with her grandparents. Her grandmother tends to Mr. Franklin and to Mr. Franklin's home, and Bet frequently accompanies her grandmother there when not at school. When Mr. Franklin becomes indisposed--having fallen from a ladder and broken his leg--he enlists Bet to sit at the log out on the riverbank by herself and read aloud. Thus the girl comes to meet that most unique mole who is not only well-spoken in the King's English, but is also inadvertently responsible for a pivotal incident in the annals of the British monarchy and, thereby, the subject of a well-known historic toast.<br /><br />But despite all of that, he is still a most down-to-earth fellow:<br /><br />\\"The mole spoke as if indeed in mid-flow of neighborly chat:'...And you probably have little idea of how delicious--how scrumptious--they are when eaten fresh. Of course, I have my worm larder--' He corrected himself. 'Worm larders, well stocked, but the prey pursued, or promptly pounced upon, and eaten fresh--as I've said--Ah! the earthworm, there's nothing like it! You can have your wireworms and your leatherjackets and as many ground beetles as you like to eat--snap! crackle! crunch! You can have them all! Even the toothsome slug has nothing to equal the near liquefaction of worm meat as I pass its length through my fingers sieving out the earth granules from its incessant feeding. Or alternatively tear it to eat it at once in great guzzling, gulping chunks.' \\"<br /><br />And as surely as Bet comes to learn the twists and turns that mark the mole's jawdropping personal tale of history, sorcery, and happenstance, readers come to realize that the story of Bet and the mole is an intense tale of friendship and selflessness and choices. And while this is a book that is quite accessible to third and fourth graders, the questions THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN poses, in regard to what one would do for a friend, makes this story also fit in quite nicely alongside any number of YAs that probe similar ground, albeit in a more edgy and mature fashion.<br /><br />\\" 'Now,' said Bet with satisfaction, 'we're going to go the whole hog.'<br /><br />\\" 'More accurately,' said the mole, 'the whole mole!' \\"<br /><br />Philippa Pearce, skillfully digging into British historic trivia, has mined a rich vein with THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN.

It flew down the road and took up a new roost near a large cardboard box nestled in the cedars. Something stirred, and it flew again. I looked closer and recognized the man Mama had fed last night asleep inside the box. He shifted and pulled his knees up closer to his chest.<br /><br />\\"I stared at him a long time, watching him sleep, wondering if he was hungry, wondering what sorrowful thing had led him to make a cardboard box his home.

Shortly thereafter, her daddy purchases a little shack behind the seawall. Sadie's parents were forced to sell their longtime Missouri home for \\"a piddling amount,\\" because there was no more work for her father--a talented mechanic and carpenter--now that the Dust Bowl had driven away the community's farmers. Among those to previously leave was Sadie's beloved best friend, Wilma, whose family headed to California.<br /><br />Now Sadie's dad plans to build a small boat and become a fisherman. Until school starts, Sadie is allowed to accompany her new friend Dollie in lining up at four A.M. for a chance to peel shrimp for a nickel per bucket.<br /><br />\\"I looked back at the door and saw people being turned away. I remembered Daddy saying, 'These are hard times, Babygirl,' and I wondered if the whole world was like this--too many people and not enough jobs.\\"<br /><br />Prior to their decision to leave Missouri, Sadie had clearly been cocooned in a loving, sheltered childhood. The story's first surprise for us--and first eye-opening moment for Sadie occurs on the drive to Texas, when they stop at a store far from the home they've left.<br /><br />\\"If Bobby hadn't lost our map in the river and Daddy hadn't taken a wrong turn, we would've never had to stop at that store. I guess that was the first time I really saw Daddy the way strangers saw him. Until then, I thought the world was full of daddies like mine. \\"We parked near the storefront and stirred up a cloud of dust that hung in the air thick as fog. I rubbed my stinging eyes and reached for the door, but Mama said no. Jacob and Emily huffed their disappointment. Bobby whined. I leaned back and turned my attention to the handful of men sitting on empty crates beside the screen door. They watched us, too, through the settling dust but kept on talking.<br /><br />\\"Daddy grabbed the handle on his open car door, swung himself out, and sat on the ground. The men hushed. Bags of tobacco gaped open, and cigarettes hung from their lips.<br /><br />\\"Daddy's shriveled lower legs lay folded in the dirt. He wore heavy socks on his twisted feet, and his shortened pants legs were tied up with cording. He wrapped it all around his small calves and over his knees every morning to keep the extra cloth out of his way. I watched him lean forward and fix his palms in the dirt. Then, using his strong arms like crutches, he lifted himself off the ground, swung his body forward, and sat. Then he did it all over again. His dangling calves and feet trailed limp beneath him with each swinging stride. \\"The men never said a word, but their wide-eyed looks followed Daddy right through the screen door.\\"<br /><br />THE TRUTH ABOUT SPARROWS has a decidedly gentle tone to it, as Sadie learns about friendship and about being in the same boat as everyone else. It's a book that will appeal to many 4th, 5th, and 6th graders.<br /><br />I'm curious to see how those readers react to Sadie's proud attitude about who she is:<br /><br />\\"...[I]t didn't take long before I noticed a rift deep as a canyon running between our side of the tracks and the town kids. To be fair, lots of them were nice...but plenty others never talked to us, never even looked at us unless they thought we weren't watching. Then I'd hear snickers and whispers...\\"[B]eing lumped into the same stewing pot with everyone on that bayfront made me mad. They were good people who didn't deserve to be treated so poorly, but we weren't like them at all. We had a nice home once, one I planned to see again someday.\\"<br /><br />Despite that gentleness and the virtuousness of Sadie's life lessons, I was thoroughly engaged by this story. I loved to see that the result of Sadie's dad being so personable, so skilled, hard working and determined was that people the family encountered were quick to see beyond his disability. And I really enjoyed the picture that the author paints of life on the Gulf for these people during the Depression: salt air and close families, the Cannery and the hurricanes, the shacks and the flour sack clothing, and the cracked red hands from lye soap and shelling shrimp.<br /><br />Back in 1933, they only had to smell the fish and that shrimp to insure that it was safe to eat. These days, seafood often comes with warning labels like cigarettes. Back in 1933, you could trust in having plenty of fresh water, even if you had to hand-pump it, or carry it from a neighbor's house, as Sadie's family has to do. These days you need a chemical lab to determine what you're getting with your H-2-O. And that's assuming that someone hasn't drained the river or aquifer before the supply reaches you.we weren't watching.

I had never even heard of Waterhouse Hawkins, and thus my fondest memories of that book naturally tend toward aspects of the man's unusual story, such as the extraordinary New Year's Eve feast Hawkins hosted inside a life-size iguanodon model, and the horror of Boss Tweed's having ordered the destruction and burial of the models Hawkins had spent years painstakingly laboring to build for an ill-fated Central Park museum.<br /><br />In the case of Walt Whitman, I grew up on Long Island near Walt Whitman Road, Walt Whitman Mall, and various Walt Whitman historic markers. I became basically familiar with the work of Walt Whitman in high school English classes, and already knew the general highlights of his life. What I was hoping for, when I learned that Brian and Barbara were working on this book, was a new look at the man that would cause myself and young readers to feel like we had really gotten to know this great American poet.<br /><br />As with Waterhouse Hawkins, they have succeeded in this regard with Walt Whitman.<br /><br />In WALT WHITMAN: WORDS FOR AMERICA, Barbara Kerley begins with a wonderful portrayal of the poet's younger years that will provoke questions about the lives of kids in that era.<br /><br />\\"At age 12, he began work as a printer's apprentice, learning to typeset newspaper articles. He saw the boxes of letters as a great mystery, waiting to unfold. Awkwardly, he held the compositor's stick, eager to see the words form--letter by letter--beneath his inky fingers.\\"<br /><br />\\"Within two years he was setting articles that he himself had written. After the newspaper was printed, his heart thumped 'double beat' as he smoothed it open and admired his work. Even when he wasn't working, Walt surrounded himself with words. He listened to famous speakers and joined a debating society. He attended plays, appreciating a fine performance 'in every...cell' of his head and heart.\\"<br /><br />So how does Selznick begin his visual accompaniment to Kerley's words? Opposite the title page he illustrates a wooden-framed typeset of that facing title page--the perfect mirror image as far as the type itself is concerned. The surrounding pieces of wood are shaded with the hints of rose and purples that anyone intimately familar with wood-grains will be able to immediately feel on their fingertips and savor just by looking at them.<br /><br />In fact, throughout the book, one of the aspects to repeatedly strike me about Selznick's illustrations is his incredible success in creating that feel of the various woodgrains and the lamplight which illuminates the wood, whether it is raw wood or honeyed from varnish, wax,or wear. There was no such thing as plastic in Whitman's lifetime, and I was constantly drawn to the fact that Brian's paintings so meticulously and (yes) breathtakingly portray in every detail the texture and materials of the 19th century world in which the poet lived.<br /><br />And then there are Selznick's various paintings of Whitman himself, from boy to man, to elderly poet. There is one such large portrait thoroughly etched into my brain, where Whitman, apparently reacting to the assassination of Lincoln, stares pensively out at us while a few whisps of his white hair fall across his brow.<br /><br />Another unforgettable (and heartbreaking) vision is that of a family at home during the Civil War, reacting to having just received a letter from Whitman letting them know that their son, whom Whitman had been caring for in a hospital, was no longer.<br /><br />Beyond the actual story, both Kerley and Selznick provide thoroughly fascinating notes at the conclusion of the book. For instance, Brian notes that:<br /><br />\\"Ms. [Barbara] Henry told me that the capital letters were placed on the upper shelf and the others on the lower shelf which is why we now have the terms 'uppercase' and 'lowercase.' \\"<br /><br />The book also concludes with the poems from which the excerpts in the story are taken.<br /><br />I knew a bunch about Walt Whitman, but for the first time the storied namesake of paved roads and shopping emporiums has become a real person for me, both in words and in pictures.varnish, wax, or wear.

US	43320771	R2MEBMED64AHJZ	0618462848	996901034	Offsides	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Richie's Picks: OFFSIDES	Soccer coach Frank \\"Chief\\" Fallace was one crazy mother. Small, fit, stone-jawed, and wiry haired, he was my Spanish teacher when I was a freshman in high school, and I can still recall the day he turned beet red while doing an awfully convincing imitation of strangling this stoner in class who'd told him to go \\"f\\" himself. I learned quickly that you definitely didn't mess with The Chief.<br /><br />Thanks to the long reach of Google, I can also tell you that \\"The Chief\\" coached the boys' varsity soccer team at Commack High School North for 21 seasons, that his teams won a total of 238 league games, and that he was County Coach of the Year in 1978. I expect that he was a pretty good player himself, during his boyhood back in Italy.<br /><br />Sportswise, it is a long, long way from early-1970s Long Island to twenty-first century California. The strength of today's youth soccer leagues in my neck of the woods easily meets or exceeds the extraordinary popularity of Little League during my childhood. Back then I never learned to play soccer, nor watched any of the games, despite having many friends on Coach Fallace's teams.<br /><br />Thus, I learned an embarrassing lot about the rules, positions, and basic strategy of playing soccer through reading OFFSIDES by Erik E. Esckilsen. The author does a great job of keeping our interest by providing solid slices of action without drowning us in either waves of technical jargon or endless play-by-play. I was consistently engaged by the battles on the field.<br /><br />\\"Hi, boys and girls. I'm Jimmy Carl Black and I'm the Indian of the group.\\"<br /><br />--from Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, \\"We're Only in it for the Money\\"<br /><br />In OFFSIDES, the soccer pitch sets the stage for the tribulations of Tom Gray, a young man who has been forced through economic circumstances to move with his mother to Southwind after the death of his father. An extraordinary soccer player whose \\"Shot of the Year\\" sent his former Tin River Union High team to last year's finals, Tom will now attend the school that is home to the squad that ultimately derailed the Tin River Union Ravens despite Tom's heroics.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, Tom's strong pride in his Mohawk heritage is set up for a head-on collision with both the Indian caricature that serves as the mascot of the Southwind Warriors, and the coach who wants Tom to join the team, but who has absolutely no intention of altering the team name or mascot. Coach Dempsey was a student at Southwind when the high school opened, and he knows all about not letting political correctness get in the way of tomahawks, tradition, and team spirit.<br /><br />What could easily have become a story descending into a didactic diatribe about the team mascot issue, instead employs some fancy footwork to entertain us with a cross between the Bad News Bears and Crutcher's band of misfits in WHALE TALK.<br /><br />\\" 'Allard Angel-Agitator launch log, August twenty-three,' [Preston] says in his 'This is your captain speaking' voice. 'Model three. Model three launch--successful. Altitude--new altitude record established at twelve hundred, thirty-seven feet by measurement of base altimeter, recorded and stored in altimeter chip. Recovery and landing apparatus--total malfunction. Repeat, landing apparatus--total malfunction. Salvage effort to commence immediately' \\"<br /><br />To achieve this plot twist, the author employs an amusing ensemble of home-schooled self-described science geeks, a mysterious homeless kid, and a foreign-born paraplegic shopkeeper-turned-coach, accompanied by his hot Russian-born blonde granddaughter, to assist Tom in eventually \\"bringing it on\\" to Coach Dempsey and the Southwind players.<br /><br />The subtleties and complexities in Coach Dempsey's personality and background bring a strong realism to his character. The underlying story concerning Tom's younger years on \\"the res\\", the difficulties that he and his mother are facing because of institutional prejudice toward Native Americans (particularly involving his Dad's death and the insurance company), and the snippets of background alluding to the Mohawks' dangerous real-life role--in constructing the iron framework on some of our nation's most heralded superstructures--add a real depth to the story.<br /><br />And then there is the underlying name and mascot issue which, to some of us, is personal and real. Our own middle school--where Shari teaches--employs both the name \\"Warriors\\" as well as an Indian caricature as the mascot, just like in the book. Our School Board turned a deaf ear to my advocacy for change the past two years. Hopefully the winds of change are finally arriving.<br /><br />But in any case, readers are sure to get a kick out of OFFSIDES. (Whoops! Yellow penalty card given for really bad pun.)his mother are facing because of institutional prejudice toward Native Americans (particularly involving his Dad's death and the insurance company), and the snippets of background alluding to the Mohawks' dangerous real-life role--in constructing the iron framework on some of our nation's most heralded superstructures--add a real depth to the story.  <br /> <br />And then there is the underlying name and mascot issue which, to some of us, is personal and real.

There is nothing as a parent that I'd like more than to see my kids grow up to be people who are trying to make this place better. Katie is now the same age I was when I participated in a high school clean up project on the first Earth Day.<br /><br />And I was living back there on the East coast when, on a summer Southampton morning in 1976, I wandered into Neil's house. Arthur was already there, and our favorite radio station, WPKN, was cranked up on the stereo. But when I walked in that morning, Arthur was all teary-eyed as he began blubbering over and over to me, \\"They just can't do that! They just can't do that!\\"<br /><br />It took twenty minutes of listening to 'PKN before they repeated the announcement that had unhinged my friend: The Board of Trustees of the University of Bridgeport had decided to take active control of \\"our\\" radio station and turn it into an NPR affiliate.<br /><br />Because I was (am, and forever shall remain) an activist/troublemaker/pain-in-the-butt, I told Arthur that he needed to immediately write letters in protest. And to this day I still cannot understand the response by Arthur which was to do absolutely nothing but moan and mourn. No matter what I said, I could not get him to write even one simple letter.<br /><br />But I did.<br /><br />I wrote to Congressman Otis Pike and told him that WPKN was a unique and vital source of alternative news and commentary for his constituents, and that the source was about to be silenced.<br /><br />A few days later the announcements of the impending change at the station ceased without fanfare or explanation. I then received a written response from Congressman Pike which included a copy of the letter sent to him by the head of the FCC who, at the Congressman's request, had inquired of the University what was going on with the radio station and was told that, oh no, nothing was going on.<br /><br />A year later, as an antinuclear activist, I had the opportunity to visit the WPKN studio to speak on the air about solar energy and conservation technologies. I brought along the letters that Congressman Pike had sent me, and was treated like a prince by the station manager when he saw that letter. He told me that he had never learned why the Trustees had abandoned their plans as abruptly as they had adopted them.<br /><br />And thus I learned that one young person can make all the difference.<br /><br />\\"Right now in the United States, twenty-six percent of the population is under eighteen.

They also left out the part where Mrs. Banks is abusively dragged into a dark prison, thrown in with rats, common criminals, blankets that get laundered once a year, and a bucket for a toilet.  Nor do they show prison employees shoving the hose up Mrs. Banks's nose to force feed her when she decides to go on a hunger strike.<br /><br />\\" 'These women have raised neither hand nor voice,' wrote one female reporter who eventually stood on the picket line herself and was arrested.  'They speak no word and do not attempt to defend themselves if attacked,' she explained.\\"<br /><br />But those omissions and discrepancies could be attributed to the fact that Mary Poppins takes place in jolly, old England, and it was in America during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson that all of these abuses were being endured by the informed women who had resolve to organize and question how the US could be fighting for democracy in Europe while simultaneously denying democratic participation--the Vote--to women at home.<br /><br />Being able to speak freely is what America is all about, right?<br /><br />But students of American history know that there are times when Freedom of Speech seems to be reserved for only SOME Americans, those who agree with the government.<br /><br />\\"Now, however, the growing nationalism of wartime made such protests seem, as reported in newspapers, 'unwomanly,' 'unpatriotic,' 'dangerous,' 'undesirable,' even 'treasonable.' \\"<br /><br />(Sound familiar?)<br /><br />The central focus of WITH COURAGE AND CLOTH: WINNING THE FIGHT FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE is on the years of widespread activism and protest directly preceding the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.  And it is during those final years of a fight that began in earnest back in Seneca Falls in 1848 that we so clearly see the parallels between the suffering of those brave Americans involved in the Women's Suffrage Movement and the violence and repression faced by those in the Civil Rights Movement; those images that so many of us watched either on television or firsthand; those images that so many of us will never forget.<br /><br />Another parallel that I found interesting involves the fact that:<br /><br />\\"The period from 1896 to 1910 (during which no states adopted woman suffrage) became known as the 'doldrums' of the movement.

Trash will make some pretty interesting shapes if you watch it long enough. I thought maybe it was trying to tell me something. Like my future or whatever. The same way people look at tea leaves.\\"<br /><br />In fact, not only couldn't I take my eyes off this book, reading it as I traveled over last Wednesday night from San Francisco to Chicago for Book Expo, but then on the flight home from Chicago last night, despite traveling with backbreaking quantities of new books in tow, I chose to read this one a second time. It's that good.<br /><br />\\"It was amazing. If you ever want to change your life immediately, just sit down in some random fast-food place and start urinating in your pants. My lap was all wet and warm, and it was running down my legs and filling my Red Wing boots.<br /><br />\\"I even told the manager. I said, 'I'm totally pissing my pants, man. Sorry.'<br /><br />\\"The manager twiddled the ends of his mustache.<br /><br />\\"He went, 'Well, that's not very sanitary, son.' Now I was his son.

I was his son, so he was obviously my dad, right?<br /><br />\\"We were one big happy Pizza Hut family.\\"<br /><br />UNDER THE WOLF, UNDER THE DOG is the emotion-filled story told to us by Steve Nugent, a lovable and confused sixteen-year-old Gifted and Talented student who is tall and skinny, tends toward the socially inept side of the scale, and who, when we meet him, has ended up in a facility after his mother dies from cancer and his big brother kills himself shortly thereafter.<br /><br />\\"I'm from East Foote, which is on the Illinois side of the Mississippi. Foote is on the Iowa side, and it's about ten times the size of East Foote. To put it in perspective, before I left, most people in East Foote had to go stand on this old livestock promontory just to get cell phone reception.<br /><br />\\"So I'm currently in residence at this place in the middle of Michigan called Burnstone Grove. There are about thirty-five kids here. About half of us are drug addicts, and the other half have tried to check out of this world in one way or another. Probably a third of us have dabbled in both pursuits. I don't entirely fit into either category, so I'm what they call a Gray Grouper. The Red Groupers are the junkies, and the Blue Groupers are the suicide kids. There are only seven Gray Groupers, and we're generally kept here for a month or two before we're either shipped back home or sent to another, more affordable, facility. The Red and Blue Groupers can stay here for over a year sometimes. They get to see the seasons change and everything. So far it's been nothing but snow and ice and frozen trees and this very low-looking iron sky.\\"<br /><br />As Steve spends his time with the Groupers and staff members at Burnstone Grove, he reveals to us the circumstances which led up to his current residency.<br /><br />\\"That's when this bailiff guy entered the room with the judge. The bailiff was pretty weird-looking. He had a shaved head and wore these yellow safety glasses, like he'd just returned from a rigorous go of it at the Foote gun club or something. The judge was pretty old, at least sixty-something, and his black gown made him look like some sort of geriatric Halloween creature in drag.\\"<br /><br />UNDER THE WOLF, UNDER THE DOG is a very personal and often humorous story. We're charmed by a whole sideshow of quirky characters, including Steve's brother's wretched drug buddy, Dantly, Shannon Lynch, the young man at Burnstone Grove who can stuff $1.87 in change up his nose,and ten-year-old June, who may haunt my dreams for some time to come.<br /><br />But above all, this is a terrifying and heartbreaking story about a sensitive kid with whom we can so easily identify, who's had so incredibly much to deal with.<br /><br />\\"Suddenly the steering wheel was vibrating.

If I count in all the warm-blooded critters on the farm, there are sixteen of \\"them\\" and three of \\"us\\"--a goofy male retriever named Samwise, a young and excitable male Nubian dairy goat, Cool Hunter (named for a character in the book, SO YESTERDAY), and me.<br /><br />I serve on the Best Books for Young Adults committee which consists of fourteen female librarians and myself. I am represented by a female member of Congress, two female members of the US Senate, and a female member of the State Assembly. Often a Saturday afternoon will find another six to eight female schoolmates--friends of our girls--giggling and screaming around the farm.<br /><br />Thus I kind of know what it feels like to be May Amelia.<br /><br />\\"There's no accounting for luck, especially luck in getting brothers.\\"<br /><br />May Amelia is a twelve year old girl living in Washington State in 1899 with her parents and her seven brothers. There is not another girl in her neck of the woods with whom to play or commiserate. There are Indians, bears, cougars, logging camps, a school you reach by boat, and one more baby on the way.<br /><br />Will this baby turn out to (finally) be another girl?<br /><br />Jennifer Holm does a superb job of characterizing each of May Amelia's seven brothers. (One, Kaarlo, is technically a blood cousin--and a rather grumpy and rude one at that--who lives with them.)<br /><br />I really like Isahiah who is in charge of the family herd of sheep. Having quietly named each of the sheep after one of their human neighbors--based upon the sheeps' visages and those of the neighbors'--there is a hysterical scene that follows Isahiah's opening a door and yelling, \\"Hurry! Mrs. Peterson has broken her back out in the south pasture,\\" and May Amelia's dad then ordering another brother to fetch Mrs. Peterson's son Lonny on his way out there.<br /><br />But the special brother--the one who is charged with keeping his eye on their sister, is close to her age, and is always there for her--is Wilbert.<br /><br />\\"For every evil God sends to me he sends an angel and I know sure for certain that Wilbert is my guardian angel.\\"<br /><br />The evilest of those \\"gifts\\" turns out to be a grandmother from hell who comes to live with her family.<br /><br />Through the series of adventures that together make up OUR ONLY MAY AMELIA, we get a real sense of the frontier that still existed in the Pacific Northwest a mere hundred years ago. We also get the fascinating paradox of having most of the males in her life constantly chiding May Amelia to be a Proper Young Lady while most of the grownup ladies around her are really pretty tough frontier women.

Her mother becomes addicted to the laudanum which eases the pain of that injury, and that addiction causes her mother to sell her little deaf son Tommy into a virtual slavery as a chimney sweep.

They were so abundant that in 1810 Alexander Wilson saw a flock pass overhead that was a mile wide and 240 miles long, containing over two billion birds. That flock could have stretched nearly twenty-three times around the equator. Passenger Pigeons were pretty and brown, with small grayish heads, barrel chests, and long, tapered wings that sent them through the sky at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.<br /><br />\\"But they had two problems: they were good to eat and they destroyed crops by eating seeds. Farmers not only shot them, but also cast huge nets over fields to trap them by the thousands. It took only a few decades to wipe out what may have been the most plentiful bird ever to live on the earth. A fourteen-year-old boy named Press Clay Southworth shot the last wild Passenger Pigeon in 1900. The species became extinct in 1914, when Martha, the last captive pigeon, died quietly in the Cincinnati Zoo.\\"<br /><br />You know those arcade games with a steering wheel and a gas pedal? (There never seems to be a brake pedal on those things.) Well, sometimes the world feels to me just like one of those babies, careening along full speed, sound effects and all, with all of us just trying to hold on and not send anyone or anything flying off the road. And then there are also those times it feels like I'm out there on that animated road like a deer in the headlights, waving my arms with all those crazy drivers blindly bearing down on me.<br /><br />\\"Humans now use up more than half of the world's fresh water and nearly half of everything that's grown on land.\\"<br /><br />Back in 1960, when there were around 177 million people in the United States, I was growing up in Plainview, L.I., which was then the eastern terminus of the Long Island Expressway. I'd sometimes go kite flying in the pasture of a nearby cow dairy. (Yes, cow dairies in Plainview.)<br /><br />In 1970, when the US was up past the 200 million people mark, my parents loaded us in the car for a drive to Florida to see the piece of investment property they'd bought in the middle of nowhere. That nowhere is now the city of Naples, Florida, and the swamps and grassy plains I saw there in 1970 are now nowhere.<br /><br />The Ivory-billed Woodpecker must have been one heck of a bird. Big, noisy, powerful, and fierce, it once existed all over what is now the US South, and its plumage and/or head was prized by Native Americans for decoration and as an amulet. Indians from the North would offer much in trade for their own specimens. Once the white boys arrived, they too killed the Ivory-billed because of the big bucks involved. THE RACE TO SAVE THE LORD GOD BIRD utilizes the story of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker as the centerpiece for a fascinating and vital history that portrays the long and belated evolution of the \\"bird lovers,\\" from the guys who loved them, shot them by the dozen, and sold them to collectors the world over, to the first modern ecologists who arose in the 1930s. Trying, at that point, to solve the mysteries of how the Ivory-billed fit into its environment, and whether there was a way to save the handful that still then existed, we read of the heroic determination by a few to prolong the life on earth of what many once called \\"that Lord God bird.\\"<br /><br />From James Audubon to the Audubon Society and beyond, THE RACE TO SAVE THE LORD GOD BIRD is as thrilling and as scary in its consequences as one of those arcade games. And, sadly, some of the corporate characters we meet treated the birds' survival as if it were a game. The story brings us to Jim Tanner, a man of my grandfather's generation, who spent years amid mosquitos and snakes, studying the world's remaining handful of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers. All living by that time ina single, last chunk of virgin riverbottom woods in Louisiana that was owned by the Singer sewing machine company, Tanner became the only person to ever band an Ivory-billed. His 1937 photos of that feisty young chick, which they came in contact with while its parents hunted for food and which they named Sonny Boy, show the proud young bird strutting atop his partner's hat. Returning to the Audubon society with the photos and a plea for immediate action, Tanner was singularly responsible for the Society's last ditch effort to save the Ivory-billed.<br /><br />It is ironic that that last ditch effort was ended by a war. A self-proclaimed money grubbing corporation, utilizing imported Nazi POWs as cheap replacement labor, deliberately destroyed that last stand of Ivory-billed habitat before it could be saved. Now, as this powerful and sure-to-be-an-award-winning book comes to press, as thousands of species continue to become extinct every year, it is ever so hard to concentrate on such abstract issues as the pending extinction of some rare bird or bug. The economy has been crappy for years, so many have no health care, and we're all focused on photos of what soldiers are doing to prisoners for the sake of democracy. There isn't much brain room for nature.<br /><br />But as the US population inexorably marches toward the 300 million mark--twice what it was when I was born a half-century ago--it is essential for today's young adults to begin considering what kind of world they want to spend their lives in. THE RACE TO SAVE THE LORD GOD BIRD illuminates the kind of important decisions that must be made, where making the wrong decision--or even no decision--will bring about irrevocable results for the planet.e in a single, last chunk of virgin riverbottom woods in Louisiana that was owned by the Singer sewing machine company, Tanner became the only person to ever band an Ivory-billed.

'This is for your protection. You're not to join in the fight,' Olaf said.<br /><br />\\" 'Don't worry,' said Jack.<br /><br />\\" 'I know how exciting pillaging is,' the giant said fondly, ruffling Jack's hair. It felt like a blow. 'No matter how much you're tempted, just say no.'<br /><br />\\" 'Just say no to pillaging. You got it.' \\"<br /><br />Despite reading some of her consistently award-winning tales, many of you may not be aware of how funny Nancy Farmer can be. But for those who have gotten to spend any time around her it's no surprise to encounter all sorts of terrific humor in her fabulous, fantastical new adventure, THE SEA OF TROLLS. And for anyone who has read Gordon Korman's SON OF THE MOB, with all of Vince's so-called \\"uncles\\" bearing wacky names, you'll understand why that book comes to mind as Nancy Farmer introduces us to the likes of Ivar the Boneless, Einar the Ear-Hoarder, Pig Face, Dirty Pants, Eric Pretty-Face, Eric the Rash, and Magnus the Mauler.<br /><br />Eleven-year-old Jack, who had been happily apprenticing with The Bard, and Jack's five-year-old sister, Lucy, are captured and enslaved by the Northmen and head off in their custody to destinations unknown. The Holy Isle that Jack sees through the haze is Lindisfarne. The Holy Isle's destruction in A.D. 793, which marked the onset of two hundred years of Viking raids on Great Britain, provides readers with a historic reference point for this year's great epic adventure story.<br /><br />Farmer packs THE SEA OF TROLLS' 450 pages full of humor, history, mythology, and adventure. This is a deceptively complex story, beyond the mere fact that readers encounter Vikings, trolls, dragons, Beowulf, big-mouth fathers, and all sorts of other good stuff in the same book.<br /><br />What readers (and Jack) are left to sort out at the end of the odyssey are their feelings about the berserkers--those Northmen invaders with whom Lucy and Jack spend all of that time.<br /><br />On one hand, the siblings and the berserkers have all become so close to each other as they share stories, meals, and life and death struggles of immense proportion. Through those experiences, and despite their beliefs and customs being so different from his own, Jack has repeatedly seen and felt their humanity. As readers, we come to know and love the violent and smelly Olaf and Thorgil, and their wild and wacky comrades. On the other hand, even as Jack has to steel himself for having to say good-bye to them, he has to recognize (as we also have to) that the berserkers' intent--indeed their need, if their civilization is to survive--is to return to Jack's Britain again and again, robbing and pillaging and enslaving and murdering and partaking in those other activities that my eighth grade science teacher would repeatedly tell us about. \\"That's why you're genetically all a little bit of everything!\\" insisted old Mr. Max Krenis in his white lab coat and spectacles.<br /><br />So how do we as readers feel about the berserkers' need to invade in order to survive?<br /><br />How would we feel if we were Jack?<br /><br />How does \\"Love thine enemies\\" relate to the story?<br /><br />How does the Stockholm Syndrome fit in?<br /><br />How will readers relate all this to our being at war right now, and to the widespread suspicion of all people from that part of the world?<br /><br />But there's still more to THE SEA OF TROLLS. In fact, there is a whole 'nother story before Olaf One-Brow and his homies even show up in Britain the first time. The tale begins with Jack and Lucy, their family, and the Bard.<br /><br />Jack's a bright kid with an overbearing father who dotes on little Lucy. The Bard is a mysterious old guy who showed up a couple of years earlier, moved into the ancient Roman house overlooking the sea, and is provided for by the community. One day when Jack is delivering provisions to the Bard, he invites Jack back for lunch.<br /><br />The relationship that develops between Jack and the Bard is so heartwarming that I'd be happy to just keep going back and reading the first portion of the book again and again. The old man takes the beaten-down boy and, as he teaches him song, story, nature, and wisdom, he works to make Jack understand what a special kid he really is. And, oh what stories the Bard does tell him.<br /><br />Then, that time as an apprentice ends for Jack with the arrival of the long ships. And the real journey begins.<br /><br />THE SEA OF TROLLS nearly defies categorization, there are so many sides to it. And I couldn't begin to recount what Shari tried to explain to me about all of Nancy Farmer's allusions to traditional mythologies. But the humor, the excitement and danger, the history, and the characters who are real enough to cause you to really mourn the end of the book make THE SEA OF TROLLS the latest success in the career of one of the great storytellers of our time.> <br />The relationship that develops between Jack and the Bard is so heartwarming that I'd be happy to just keep going back and reading the first portion of the book again and again.

I recognized the shirt; that was my only tip-off--well, that and my name underneath. Mom says to just be myself, but if I can't even recognize myself in a photograph from last summer, how am I supposed to have any clue who I am?\\"<br /><br />The fact that the statuesque, rather popular (and quite tidy) Meg Runyon is to be found amid the cream of the seventh grade academic elite at Fisher High School, while the small-for-his-age, single-friended (and rather messy) Edward Runyon skateboards and daydreams his way through Charlton Street Alternative School belies the fact that the pair (albeit an unmatched pair) are twins. Buoyed by the new school year's arrangements which allow them to stay well clear of each other, it is a single telephone call that plunges the pair into five uproariously funny days of wild schemes, imaginary bands and boyfriends, thoroughly baffled parents, a high profile music executive, a janitor turned agent, and a sea of dip at an upscale Manhattan party.<br /><br />But first, that phone call:<br /><br />Edward:<br /><br />\\"I was heading back to my room when the phone rang.

What school do you go to?'<br /><br />\\" 'The Manhattan Detention Home for Troubled Boys.'<br /><br />\\"There was a pause. 'Is that really true?' she asked in her whispery voice.<br /><br />\\" 'Hey, dude, if it's not true, you get a free cow pie at Harry's Pizzeria. Comes with extra cat hairball toppings.'<br /><br />For a moment she--whoever it was--thought about that. Then, 'Can I speak to Meg, please?'<br /><br />\\"Who's calling?'<br /><br />\\" 'Kimberly.'<br /><br />\\"I'm not sure if you are on her A-list of callers.'<br /><br />\\"Another pause.

Then I made this click sound with my tongue. You won't believe how hard I practiced that sound. It fools Meg every time. Next I rotated the receiver away from my mouth so she wouldn't hear my breathing.<br /><br />\\"Then, hoping my folks wouldn't come by, I listened to the whole conversation.\\"<br /><br />Amid the zaniness of those five days following the phone call, NEVER MIND! brings to the surface (and satirizes) the popularity issues that are so familiar to the kids in fourth through eighth grade who will find this book such a delight. Meg's quandry about how to deal with the architects of the High Achievers Club, how to deal with \\"unpopular\\" students such as Esther Grossbart, and her thoughts about how her longtime friends at her former school would perceive her behavior elevate the book to a valuable piece of children's literature.<br /><br />Written in the alternating voices of the twins, it must have similarly been a delight for these two authors to work and scheme together like this.

I gasped, and heard the intake of breath throughout the meeting. I was shocked that they would treat an old man so; and frightened, too, as I realized what was to come.<br /><br />\\" 'Seize them all!' cried Danson.<br /><br />\\"The soldiers began to strike left and right, hitting anyone within reach. They struck people with fists and clubs. I saw Samuel Minton fall, and his wife on top of him. Judith's brother Tom was struck across the face. Hannah Davies, with her child in her arms, was flung toward the door.\\"<br /><br />Those sanitized versions in grade school US history books that we all grew up with, of the Quakers coming to Colonial America in order to be able to worship as they pleased, do not begin to hint at the real picture of what these people were subjected to in Britain shortly after the death of Cromwell and the restoration of the monarchy.<br /><br />Set in 1662, the graphic, gut-wrenching depictions of the violence and \\"intolerance\\" of Quakers in Britain makes NO SHAME, NO FEAR the most significant piece of YA literature I have ever read in regard to that cornerstone--the freedom of religion--upon which our nation was founded.<br /><br />But the relationship between the book's two narrators, 15 year-old Susanna, daughter of Quaker parents, and 17 year-old William, just back from Oxford, and son to a prosperous and influential Anglican merchant, makes NO SHAME, NO FEAR also one of the great love stories of the year.<br /><br />\\"I thought about her all the time; imagined being alone with her, being free to touch, to kiss. The strength of my feelings took me by surprise; I had known nothing of this before.<br /><br />\\"But I had to keep her secret. I knew my father would see any connection with a servant girl as beneath me, and if he found out she was a Quaker, he would be furious. And yet I sought her out, not just in the safety of Mary's shop, but around the town.\\"<br /><br />From reading NO SHAME, NO FEAR it is fair to conclude that the supposedly good people of 17th century Britain spent a lot of time (literally) throwing horse manure at those they despised. Ann Turnbull's vivid depictions extend to details of that era's housing, cooking, laundering and bathing, commerce, apprenticeships, court, health care, and prison systems.<br /><br />Susanna is working for Mary, a fellow Quaker who runs a print shop, and at one point deep into the story when nearly all the Quakers in town are jailed--asphyxiating, being gnawed on by lice, fleas, and rats, and sharing one coed slops bucket among dozens of prisoners--William offers to operate the press for Mary, who had intended to find and hire on some muscled ex-convict to do the work. In observing William's attempt to master the process by trying to actually print a pamphlet, we get a true sense of the work involved:<br /><br />\\" 'Concerning the PERSECUTION...'

Their chance meeting in Manhattan's East River Park leads to a wild and intense three day roller coaster ride for the pair, and takes readers on a reality trip into the big stakes world of fashion fads and trends.<br /><br />I'm no babe in the woods, myself. I'm a guy with a degree in Business, who once earned an \\"A\\" in Marketing as manager of the group that won that semester's computer-simulated car manufacturing competition. But I picked up all sorts of fascinating information while my eyes were glued to SO YESTERDAY. For instance, Hunter tells this story which actually ties in with those three days we follow Jen and him through New York City:<br /><br />\\"Start with a mollusk, wind up with an empire.<br /><br />\\"Sounds tricky, but the Phoenicians managed it about four thousand years ago. Their tiny sliver of a kingdom was wedged between the Mediterranean Sea and a vast desert: no gold mines, no olive trees, no amber waves of grain anywhere in sight. The only thing the Phoenicians had going for them was a certain species of shellfish, commonly found lying around down at the beach. These shellfish were tasty but had one problem--if you ate too many of them, your teeth turned purple.<br /><br />\\"Naturally, most people were annoyed by this. They probably said stuff like, 'Those shellfish aren't bad, but who wants purple teeth?' and didn't think much more about it.<br /><br />\\"Then one day an ancient Innovator got this crazy idea...<br /><br />\\"Okay, imagine you live in Egypt or Greece or Persia back then and you're rich. You've got all the gold, olive oil, and grain you want. But all you ever get to wear is cloth robes that come in the following colors: light beige, medium beige, dark beige. You've seen the Bible movies: everyone's totally decked out in earth tones--that's all they had, that's all they could imagine having.<br /><br />\\"Then one day along comes a boatload of Phoenicians, and they're selling purple cloth. Purple!<br /><br />\\"Throw that beige wardrobe away!<br /><br />\\"For a while purple is the thing, the biggest fad since that whole wheel craze. After a lifetime spent wearing sixteen shades of beige, everyone's lining up to buy the cool new cloth. The price is crazy high, partly due to demand and partly because it happens to take about 200,000 shellfish to make one ounce of dye, and pretty soon the Phoenicians are rolling in dough (actually they're rolling in gold, olive oil, and grain, but you get the picture).<br /><br />\\"A trading empire is born. And talk about branding: Phoenicia is the ancient Greek word for 'purple.' You are what you sell.<br /><br />\\"After a while, however, an interesting thing happens. The people in charge decide that purple is too cool for just anyone to wear. First they put taxes on purple cloth, then pass a law against the hoi polloi wearing purple (as if they could afford it), and finally make purple robes the sole property of kings and queens.<br /><br />\\"Over the centuries this dress code becomes so widespread and so ingrained that even now, four thousand years later, the color purple is still associated with royalty throughout Europe. And all this because an Innovator who lived forty centuries ago figured he could make something cool out of the purple-teeth problem.\\"<br /><br />I've been a major fan and advocate of THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LARRY and FEED, two outstanding books that include themes of American consumer compulsion and overindulgence. SO YESTERDAY is one heck of a companion to both of these titles.

BUCKING THE SARGE is not a book that they will be reading aloud to their students in the same way that thousands of them have been reading THE WATSONS GO TO BIRMINGHAM, 1963 and BUD NOT BUDDY.<br /><br />But those of us who spend most of our time in the somewhat-older, YA world are gonna be doing some kind of badass NFL-style victory dance for having lured Christopher over to our side of the 'hood with his latest tale full of one-of-a-kind characters and occasional laugh-till-the-snot-and tears-pour-out situations.<br /><br />\\"I don't mean to say my boy is obsessed, but Sparky blames all our problems on the fact that we live in Flint. Yeah, I'm looking to get out someday myself, but this is one of those things that me and Sparky don't think alike on. But that's not his fault. My mind is trained in a different way than his.<br /><br />\\"I like to look at everything philosophically, and he doesn't. I've known since I was about six that thinking that way will get you what you need in life so I've been studying philosophical junk since then.<br /><br />\\"It gets a laugh every time I tell someone but by the time I'm twenty-one I plan on being America's best-known, best-loved, best-paid philosopher. And that's a job that there's gotta be a big demand for 'cause how many full-time, professional American philosophers can you think of?<br /><br />\\"I rest my case.\\"<br /><br />Luther T. Farrell is a skinny, six-foot-four student at Whittier Middle School. He is actually fifteen, even though his driver's license says eighteen. Sparky is his best friend and foil. Luther is a success with science fair projects but less so with love (as evidenced by the well-aged condom in his wallet that he's named Chauncey). He quietly longs for romance with Shayla, the pretty and smart undertaker's daughter whom he's known forever. He's also big on making lists.<br /><br />Luther's mother, a.k.a. The Sarge, has him stretched between school and work. The Sarge is the loan-sharking, slum-lording, government reimbursement-sucking, ever-scamming operator of numerous sub-par establishments, including the Happy Neighbor Group Home for Men, where she's had Luther living with, caring for, and chauffeuring around the clients since he was thirteen.<br /><br />For a reasonably easy and often-funny read, BUCKING THE SARGE is also riddled with complexities and darkness. The Sarge and Darnell Dixon (\\"the Sarge's go-to guy and my boss and one of Flint's leading psychopath nut jobs\\") are a matched set of ticking time bombs. The Sarge's consistently despicable and cruel treatment of society's most vulnerable groups--children, the poor, the elderly--is topped off by the pair's gross brutality during their eviction of a family that includes one of Luther's classmates.<br /><br />When, at one point, Luther \\"[gets] up enough nerve to tell her that I was thinking about quitting working at the home and was probably gonna get a job at Micky D's,\\" she repeats the jaw-dropping story of how she got to where she is today. The moral of that bitter recollection is that she has learned from the wealthy, the politicians, and the corporations to milk \\"any- and everything that moves. If it's got nipples, I'm going to milk it.\\" To recognize this cold, hard, violent woman as a mimic and parody of the \\"winners\\" in the American economic system of the haves and the have-nots is to understand this subtle yet scathing indictment of the system.<br /><br />Luther, himself, tells us that he's learned philosophically to see things from both sides. \\"What's important is that you keep your mind wide open and try to understand what's going on from a lot of different angles. That's what I try to remember every time I talk to the Sarge or think about her or try to understand why she is the way she is.\\" But, in either case, we see a dangerous woman who--whether full of great advice or not--is clearly not in a space to be what we'd consider to be a loving mother.<br /><br />And dark humor is certainly found in the dangerous extremes to which Luther's buddy, Sparky, is willing to go in order to try and escape Flint. Those vivid images make us cringe as we laugh (or is it laugh as we cringe).<br /><br />\\"Sparky took three steps back, then fell in a pile limp as a towel you just dried off with after a shower. It seemed like all of his bones had been Jell-O-fied.\\"<br /><br />There are a wealth of contemporary coming of age tales, but in the hands of Christopher Paul Curtis it's a whole new story.<br /><br />\\"I've learned that if you don't write down what you're thinking about, no matter how amazing it is you'll forget it. I don't like to brag, but I know I've had a couple of ideas that were so great and shocking that they'd've won the Nobel Peace Prize of Philosophy. The only problem was I didn't write them down and by the time I got home or got out of the shower they were long gone.\\"<br /><br />Even more so than with Kenny or Bud, we're left at the finish wondering about the future of this goodhearted kid we've come to love.

The ongoing extermination of all those people by Hitler's forces would be something--if I had been alive at the time--I couldn't have just ignored. My response options wouldn't have been as simple as merely running away from the insanity, in the manner that I intended to avoid involvement in the Vietnam War, had it lasted a little longer.<br /><br />\\"Is there anybody here who thinks, that<br /><br />Followin' the orders takes away the blame<br /><br />Is there anybody here<br /><br />Who wouldn't mind a murder by another name<br /><br />--Phil Ochs, \\"Is There Anybody Here\\"<br /><br />Over the years I've gotten to know survivors and relatives of survivors of the Concentration camps, victims and relatives of victims of the Japanese Internment camps, as well as relatives and many family friends who fought for the US in The War.<br /><br />In my search for great books about WWII, LEFT FOR DEAD, THE DIVINE WIND, THE ART OF KEEPING COOL, and THE LIFE AND DEATH OF ADOLF HITLER top my list of recently published YA literature relating to that period of history.<br /><br />The latest YA tale set during World War II to intrigue me is Iain Lawrence's B FOR BUSTER, the story of a sixteen-year-old Canadian boy who has snuck away from his mother and abusive father, lied about his age and background, and finds himself in 1943 Yorkshire, England as a wireless operator in a squadron of the Canadian Air Force.<br /><br />\\"I set the frequencies on my wireless. I fitted the screwdriver into the slot and turned it back and forth to match the numbers on my flimsy. It was a chore I had done so often, on so many [training] flights, that I found it hard to believe that I was doing it now on the way to Germany, astride a belly full of bombs. Then I grinned inside my mask to think that I was already on the battlefield, fighting in the boundless world of Superman and Buck Rogers, on a fabulous field that stretched in all directions and rose from the earth to the heavens. I imagined the people below turning their faces to the sky, telling each other, 'Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane. It's--the Kakabeka Kid!' \\"<br /><br />By the time this first op (mission) is complete, \\"Kak\\" and his fellow trainees have a rather different view of what they've gotten themselves into.<br /><br />\\"When I was still in school I read a story about a boy who had to choose between two doors.

Behind the other was a tiger who would kill him.<br /><br />\\"I didn't remember anything else about the story, only those two doors and the boy's terror as he stepped forward to open one of them.

Each of the Halifaxes carried homing pigeons who could be sent off to the base with a message, if a plane was fortunate enough to survive an \\"unexpected\\" landing,whether due to attack or to malfunction.

The first of this year's Gravenstein apples are piled up in crates and bins over at Andy's Farm Basket, which sits alongside the road halfway between here and downtown Sebastopol. Driving to the feed store yesterday morning, I passed a pair of lumbering flatbeds hauling huge harvest boxes that were brimming with what has long become my favorite apple in the world.<br /><br />The Gravenstein apple has maintained its star status in Sebastopol since local plant guru Luther Burbank turned Nathaniel Griffith on to them in the late 1800s. For more than a hundred years now, our little community has sponsored an annual Apple Blossom Parade with dignitaries, floats, fire trucks and marching bands, as well as an annual Gravenstein Apple Fair. (This year's fair is August 14-15 and John Dawson will be bringing out his Twenty-first century version of New Riders of the Purple Sage on that Sunday afternoon.)<br /><br />Back in the mid-1980s when I purchased this farm, up here in the coastal hills, it was bordered on three sides by Gravenstein orchards. The fourth, downhill side still reveals a panoramic view of valleys and hills, extinct volcanic mountains, The Geysers (which are now pretty well played out), the city of Santa Rosa, and the old Gravenstein cannery which is nowadays leased out in little segments to small food processors and industrial fabricators.<br /><br />Over my twenty years in Sebastopol, the established Gravenstein orchards have gradually been replaced to a large degree by new vineyards. I used to be hedged into the middle of a blossoming springtime fairyland; now the Gravenstein trees on my north and west sides have been torn out, burned, and replaced by grape trellises. (Yes, it was a nasty, dusty, sad couple of years while that was happening.)<br /><br />I can gaze out past Laguna Road, where Nathaniel Griffith got it all going during the Victorian era. There, too, the apple orchards vie with vineyards and upscale horse pastures to maintain a toehold.<br /><br />\\"I tell you life is sweet<br /><br />in spite of the misery<br /><br />there's so much more<br /><br />be grateful\\"<br /><br />--Natalie Merchant, \\"Life is Sweet\\"<br /><br />Ida B. likes Macintosh apples best. (They actually used to also be my favorite, prior to my moving to California and discovering Gravensteins.)<br /><br />\\" 'Come on, Rufus,' I called to Daddy's old floppy-eared dog, who was napping under the table. 'You can come, too, so you'll have some company.'<br /><br />\\"Now, a school of goldfish could go swimming in the pool of drool that dog makes while he's sleeping. But as soon as he heard his name and saw me heading for outside he jumped up and cleaned up the extra slobber around his mouth, and in two and one-half seconds' time, he was waiting for me at the back door.\\"<br /><br />Ida B. Applewood is a precocious and rambunctious young lady growing up in Wisconsin who regularly converses with the old apple trees and the lively brook that share her parents farm. Her dad has taught her that credo about leaving a place better than you find it, and she fully expects that the farm will one day be hers. Ida B. has bestowed names on each of those beloved trees, in the same manner that you'd name a dog Rufus, or a cat Lulu.<br /><br />Ida B. is also a child who takes comfort in the consistencies in her life and can catch a case of the blues when faced with uncertainty.<br /><br />\\"I stared down at all those little raisins that used to seem so happy bobbing around like they were swimming, but now they looked like they were drowning in a sea of milk.\\"<br /><br />Since suffering an emotionally traumatic start to kindergarten--thanks to a teacher with too many rules and too little understanding for this unusual girl--Ida B.'s parents have provided her an alternative, working to properly homeschool her while still leaving Ida B. plenty of time to enjoy her personal dreamland out in the apple trees.<br /><br />But then her mother gets sick and Ida B.'s whole world comes crashing down.<br /><br />\\"That cancer was like bugs in a tree: one day you don't see them at all and the next it seems like they're everywhere, eating the leaves and the fruit.

IT	\\"I know you're out there somewhere<br />Somewhere, somewhere<br />I know I'll find you somehow<br />And somehow I'll return again to you\\"<br />--The Moody Blues<br />\\"If truth was a crayon and it was up to me to put a wrapper around it and name its color, I know just what I would call it--dinosaur skin. I used to think, without really thinking about it, that I knew what color that was. But that was a long time ago, before I knew what I know now about both dinosaur skin and the truth.\\"<br />The truth about her mother's background and past is as totally unknown to Heidi as is the true color of dinosaur skin. That is due to the fact that there are a grand total of twenty-three words, sounds, or short phrases that her mother is capable of articulating.<br />\\"One thing I knew for a fact, from the time I knew anything at all, was that I didn't have a father. What I had was Mama and Bernadette, and as far as I was concerned, that was plenty. Bernadette started off being the next-door neighbor, but that didn't last very long. My mother loved me in her own special way, but she couldn't take care of me herself because of her bum brain. Bernie once explained it to me by comparing Mama to a broken machine.<br />\\" 'All the basic parts are there, Heidi, and from the outside she looks like she should work just fine, but inside there are lots of mysterious little pieces busted or bent or missing altogether, and without them her machine doesn't run quite right.'<br />\\"And it never would.\\"<br />\\"Now the time has come to speak<br />I was not able<br />And water through a rusted pipe<br />Could make the sense that I do\\"<br />--Suzanne Vega \\"Rusted Pipe\\"<br />When Heidi's mother appeared on Bernadette's doorstep in Reno twelve years earlier with baby Heidi in her arms, Bernie's repeated questioning of who they were elicited the same response again and again from the mother: \\"So be it\\" and \\"Heidi.\\" Thus, they became So B. It and Heidi It. Bernadette, who has since been raising and homeschooling Heidi while caring for Heidi's mother, has her own incapacitating disability--she's plagued by a phobia that prevents her from ever leaving the pair of attached apartments that the trio share. Meanwhile, Heidi has her own unusual quality--a gift that falls into the realm of magic.<br />But it will take more than just magic to uncover the truth of her mother's origins. While most of those twenty-three words are common ones, there is one--soof--that is uniquely Heidi's mom's.<br />\\"[O]nly Mama knew what it meant. And she wasn't telling.<br />\\" 'What is soof, Mama?' I'd whisper as I sat on the edge of her bed at night gently scratching her back. I hoped it might slip out of her mouth and onto her pillowcase as she closed her eyes and relaxed into the rhythm of my scratching.<br />\\"Sometimes I'd sit down next to her on the couch, open up a magazine, and flip through the pictures, pointing at things--a baby, a dog, a car.<br />\\" 'Show me soof, Mama. Is this soof? Is this?'<br />\\"Mama would smile her sweet, wide smile and pat my knee the way she always did when I sat close to her.<br />\\" 'Tea, Heidi?' she'd say. 'Tea?' \\"<br />When vital clues to the mystery of her mother's past appear, Heidi embarks upon a lone cross-country trip to search for that elusive truth.<br />\\"I'd be lying if I said that given a choice, I wouldn't rather know than not know. But there are some things you can just know for no good reason other than that you do, and then there are other things that no matter how badly you want to know them, you just can't.<br />\\"The truth is, whether you know something or not doesn't change what was. If dinosaurs were blue, they were blue, if they were brown, they were brown whether anybody ever knows it for a fact or not.\\"<br />In the manner of some great award-winning stories of previous years in which young characters journey to discover who they are, Heidi's solitary quest touched my heart and made me just want to hug this wonderful young woman.<br />(And that's the truth.)<br />Richie Partington<br />Richie Partington	2004-06-30

Of course, all superheros started off that way.  It said so in his How to Draw Superheros book.\\"<br /><br />\\"Heck Superhero, lost and abandoned in the world of mortals, without his supersuit and the tokens of his strength...<br />\\"Heck sat up straight and looked around the mall.  No one was looking at him, but he could almost hear Mr. Bandras's voice: 'Daydreaming again, Heck?  There's a time and a place for that, and this isn't it.'<br />\\"Heck had to admit that now was not a good time to be daydreaming.  Not when they'd lost their apartment and when his portfolio with all his semester artwork was locked in it and when bacteria were mining their way down through his molars and his jawbone.  He had to stay in this microverse and take care of his mom.  Flat or not, he had to get to his mom soon.  He had to get her out of hypertime, keep her from thinking crazy stuff like that he was better off without her or something.  He had to talk to her before she floated like a dry leaf right out of this dimension.<br />\\"He had to think, make a plan, a good plan, a smart plan--a superplan...<br />\\"There was always the Good Deed.<br />\\"Of course, there was that bad deed still in his pocket to worry about.<br />\\"A delicious smell from the mall's food court drifted right up his nostrils.  He was hungry.<br />\\"He'd been hungry before, but not this hungry.  He felt turned inside out, like his stomach was on the outside of him and his human face on the inside.  Being this hungry put his stomach in charge of his brain and his hands and his feet.  If you weren't a superhero, being this hungry could make you spend the money you stole from your best friend...\\"<br /><br />Despite all of that boundless affection that I feel for really great new books, it is exceedingly rare for me to be wishing for another couple of hundred pages.  This is one of those uncommon instances.  Having charged at breakneck speed through the first half of this book's 144 pages, I was already mourning how little remained with a measure of despair comparable to that with which I greet the longest day of the year--knowing that it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />\\"It was an unsettling feeling, like he'd just lost track of the spin of the earth.  This was how his mom felt all the time, he thought.  It must be, for her, like trying to jump onto a spinning merry-go-round.\\"<br /><br />But I can also understand Martine Leavitt's need to let go after these 144 power-packed pages.  I can't remember a previous instance where I found myself musing about a young character's mind moving at a velocity reminiscent of Neil Cassidy's mouth.  HECK SUPERHERO lays bare ninety-six critical hours in the life of this thirteen-year-old all-too-human kid who has channeled a lifetime of chronic neglect by his severely depressed mother into becoming a caregiver and doer of Good Deeds as well as becoming a truly extraordinary artist.  In the words of his art teacher Mr. Bandras,<br /><br />\\" 'I'm going to tell you something, Heck.  I've been teaching for twenty-four years.  For twenty-four years I've been telling myself that my work is meaningful, that I've been enriching the lives of children by introducing them to the soul-expanding visual arts.  Maybe I've done that.  But some of the kids I taught my first year are turning thirty-seven this year.  They are clerks and salesmen and mechanics and doctors.  None of them go to art galleries, never mind pick up a paintbrush.  Sometimes they dazzle their kids and draw a really good horse.  Are you hearing me, Heck?  If I had a nickel for every time a student came back and said, \\"Thanks for enriching my life with the visual arts,\\" I'd have a whole fifteen cents.  I've spent fifty-one thousand eight hundred and forty hours of my diabetic and therefore shortened lifespan babysitting art students.'<br />\\"He pulled up and parked in front of Heck's ex-apartment building.  He sighed.  'Then you came along, Heck.  Once in a lifetime a student like you.  Someone with art eyes.  It was worth twenty-four years to get you.  Now, I know you, and I know something's going on.' \\"<br /><br />But, no, Heck's fears of what could happen to his mom because of her failures, and where she and Heck could each end up, stops him from revealing to his Mr. Bandras or to his best friend Spence how irrevocably bad things have gotten this time.  He's sure he's got to go it alone, and he tenaciously grasps that thin thread--his belief that \\"if you did a true Good Deed, you could change the microverse, maybe change it to a better one.\\"<br /><br />But how much worse can he let it get before he opens his mouth or before he hits a wall?<br /><br />\\"If you were flat you could slide under locked doors at night and get stuff.  Stuff you needed, like art supplies.  When you were someone who urinated in public places it was the next logical step, wasn't it?  If you were a person who stole money from your best friends and did drugs and went to prison, wasn't the next step to take stuff from people you didn't even know?  If you urinated in people's driveway, that sealed it.<br />\\"Heck's teeth had rhythm: pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain...<br />\\"He punched his jaw.\\"<br /><br />As the cover illustration says, \\"KA-POW!\\"<br /><br />Stop listening to what I'm saying, drop everything, and go read this book.<br /> (...)ding.

The other students were watching him, too. He felt as if he was up on a stage and no one had told him what part to play. This massive black boy was invading his space on the very first day of high school, dammit! It felt like his cool was a house of cards and this woolly black mammoth was shaking the floor. Brandon had gone to a private school from kindergarten through junior high, so he didn't know anyone here. He had no posse to take his back and validate his coolness permit. He remembered something his father had said about making career decisions. Nobody would dis him for dissing this dude, but they'd probably dis him for not. And they'd have him under a microscope for all this freakin' period.

Can't you tell that?'<br />\\" 'Yes. But I still don't know why. We were best friends for six years. How come all of a sudden you can't even sit at a lunch table with me?'

Written by some great YA authors who are, themselves, from a multiplicity of family backgrounds, and utilizing the wisdom of their own firsthand experiences within the changing American social structure, their fictional tales probe the subtleties and complexities that arise amid the interactions of variously hued adolescent characters in today's world.<br />\\"Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong<br />My own beliefs are in my song<br />The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then<br />Makes no difference what group I'm in\\"<br />--Sly & the Family Stone, \\"Everyday People\\"<br />\\"When you go to a high school in a town so small that you have to look twice to see it when you're passing through, everyone knows who you are...That's especially true in school, where you've been with the same kids ever since you were in preschool together.

US	43320771	ROVWKXZV6BO7E	0805075658	191392341	Doing It	Books	5	33	43	N	N	Richies Picks: DOING IT	Last year many of us got to read the highly publicized and highly charged essay in The Guardian by British author Anne Fine about the new Melvin Burgess novel DOING IT. (If you haven't read the essay, Google \\"Guardian Anne Fine Doing It\\" and you'll find a link.) To put it mildly, Anne Fine was unable to find the appeal in DOING IT.<br />Reading Fine's attack, along with statements by other writers about Burgess's proported attempts to \\"push the envelope\\" by having the male, high school characters so candidly discussing issues of male sexuality, left me somewhat squeemish about the prospect of reading the book. I'd heard lots of \\"Wows,\\" but not any \\"Really great story!\\"<br />DOING IT is, in fact, a really great story about three male high school friends and their obsessions about and relationships with females. It is well-written and compelling, fun and honest and occasionally heartwarming. Those three high school boys are a self conscious, vulnerable, and sensitive lot. And while I cannot necessarily see myself as any one of those three characters, I had friends in high school who were dead ringers.<br />To argue that normal high school boys don't spend a lot of time thinking about girls and girls' bodies would make my high school experience abnormal. (It could be argued that Richie's Picks began in the late 1960s when I kept a secret, hidden list, updated weekly, of the ten girls at school I'd most like to be with.) To argue that boys aren't fearful about their adequacy, that they don't worry about whether their bodies are normal, or that they don't say truly gross stuff on a regular basis is, of course, ridiculous. And to argue that boys won't go crazy over this book is something that even Ms. Fine didn't even have the...um...nerve to claim.<br />My point is this: DOING IT is a primo Growing Up Male book. High school and public YA librarians absolutely need to forget about Anne Fine's fears of DOING IT. Instead they need to read DOING IT and need to buy it for their collections whether or not it is their cup of T (as in testosterone).<br />I'm recommending this book for all high school and public library YA collections.their collections whether or not it is their cup of T (as in testosterone). <br />I'm recommending this book for all high school and public library YA collections.	2004-06-19

One of the anchors finally caught and, for a few brief moments, the Relief hovered in the wild surge of the breakers. '[T]he ship rose and fell a few times with the swell,' Dana wrote, 'and then rose and careened as if half mad: her decks were deluged with the sweeping waves, which poured in torrents down the hatches.' The strain on the cables proved too much, and at 11:30 P.M. the anchor chain parted. '[W]e found ourselves,' Long wrote, 'at God's mercy.' &quot;<br />I am a major fan of Joy Hakim's American History series, THE HISTORY OF US. But looking back through it today, I am surprised. While Ms. Hakim devotes five pages to an excellent biographical introduction of Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838), the author of THE NEW AMERICAN PRACTICAL NAVIGATOR, there is not a single word in her entire series about Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, the man who was undoubtedly Bowditch's most important student.<br />Hakim is not alone in having ignored Wilkes. I telephoned an eighth-grade student to check on our middle school's American History text. Again, no mention of Lieutenant Wilkes.<br />Despite my own love for American History, if I've ever heard mention of Wilkes, it has certainly slipped my mind. And yet, as the commander of the U.S. Exploring Expedition (referred to as the Ex. Ex.), Wilkes led an incredibly ambitious and successful four-year journey that ranks right up there with that of Lewis and Clark.<br />&quot;By any measure, the achievements of the Expedition would be extraordinary. After four years at sea, after losing two ships and twenty-eight officers and men, the Expedition logged 87,000 miles, surveyed 280 Pacific Islands, and created 180 charts--some of which were still being used as late as World War II. The Expedition also mapped 800 miles of coastline in the Pacific Northwest and 1,500 miles of the icebound Antarctic coast. Just as important would be its contribution to the rise of science in America. The thousands of specimens and artifacts amassed by the Expedition's scientists would become the foundation of the collections of the Smithsonian Institution. Indeed, without the Ex. Ex., there might never have been a national museum in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Botanical Garden, the U.S. Hydrographic Office, and the Naval Observatory all owe their existence, in varying degrees, to the Expedition.&quot;<br />So why is the groundbreaking work of the Expedition so widely ignored? That is the question that Nathaniel Philbrick both asks and provides answers for in his latest, thrilling volume of nonfiction, SEA OF GLORY.<br />The reason for the Ex. Ex. having become a complex and controversial subject that is ignored by American history textbooks has to do with Wilkes. On one hand, Wilkes was one heck of a history-making marine surveyor, and one bold, daring, and determined hombre when it came to exploring uncharted seas and supervising collection of information and specimens. But he was an equally crazy, abusive, and evil SOB when it came to leading men and dealing with natives, Brits, superiors, subordinates, Friends, Romans, Countryman...(You get the idea.) And since what comes around goes around, his return to America after four years of such phenomenal successes was cause for a court-martial rather than a rolling out of the red carpet.<br />The trouble began not long after the Expedition set sail.<br />&quot;All his life, Wilkes had cast himself as the righteous outsider who must battle against the forces of ignorance and ineptitude to achieve what others thought could never be done. He was the antithesis of the 'team player,' and as he had proven...more than a decade before, he was capable of turning on the people closest to him if he thought it served his best interests...<br />&quot;A year into the Expedition, Wilkes had essentially re-created the environment in which he had always operated: it was he, and he alone, against the rest of the world. It was a turbulent, hurtful, and ultimately wasteful way to conduct one's life, but it was the only way he knew how to do it.&quot;<br />Nathaniel Philbrick once again showcases his ability to meld primary source materials with commentary and background in a manner that grabs and holds readers. It is incredibly exciting to travel with these nineteenth century Americans as they dodge icebergs, challenge dangerous straits, and climb Mauna Kea. It is truly fascinating to read about the disparities between what had at that time previously been reported--even in the well-traveled Atlantic--and that which Wilkes surveyed. As the author points out, &quot;As the Ex. Ex. was proving, exploration was as much about discovering what did not exist as it was about finding something new.&quot; The book is immersed in the rich mathematical and scientific background information that is necessary to really understand the Expedition's procedures and accomplishments.<br />But what is also thought-provoking--particularly in the context of today's communications revolution where we can be in touch with anyone, anywhere (including Mars) at a moment's notice--is that a vital and pivotal U.S. government operation and its commander could operate for four long years without word one passing between Wilkes and either his military superiors or civilian government officials in Washington, D.C. (Then again I suppose, considering testimony in the current highly publicized hearings going on, some might say that, &quot;Things never change.&quot;)<br />SEA OF GLORY reveals a significant chunk of American History that--as with the many aficionados of the Lewis and Clark Trail--will have readers wanting to visit Pacific Islands, Antarctic peninsulas, and Pacific Northwest landmarks. Thanks to Nathaniel Philbrick, the U.S. Exploring Expedition and its remarkable-yet-flawed leader will be given its due in our nation's history.ecade before, he was capable of turning on the people closest to him if he thought it served his best interests...<BR>&quot;A year into the Expedition, Wilkes had essentially re-created the environment in which he had always operated: it was he, and he alone, against the rest of the world.

Several of the \\"good guy\\" characters--Mrs. Carr and the elder Mrs. Hurd, for example--have a charm reminiscent of the idiosyncratic folk in BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE. But, because of the depth of the evil behind the tragic real events upon which the fictional story of Lizzie and Turner is built, the feelings of despair and anger with which we're left evoke memories of such books as MISSISSIPPI TRIAL, 1955 and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.<br />The enchanting Lizzie Bright Griffin, a girl of great strength and few words, belongs to the youngest of many generations of African Americans who have called Malaga Island home.<br />\\"Lizzie held close against her grandfather as the people of Malaga Island came out from the pine woods, gathered around their preacher on the shore to hear what had been said. Before they turned, Lizzie felt her grandfather ebb as though his soul were passing out of him, the way the last waves of a falling tide pass into still air and are gone. \\"She took a deep breath, and she wasn't just breathing in the air. She breathed in the waves, the sea grass, the pines, the pale lichens on the granite, the sweet shimmering of the pebbles dragged back and forth in the surf, the fish hawk diving to the waves, the dolphin jumping out of them.<br />\\"She would not ebb.<br />\\"Then she turned with her grandfather to tell the gathering people of Malaga that times had moved on, and they would have to leave their homes.\\"<br />Across the water, on the mainland, Turner is the new kid in town.

Meanwhile, He has had the Serpent taking care of and teaching young Eve in a distant part of the Garden. Now, the Serpent has brought Eve to meet her Creator and Adam for the first time. The fun-loving, irresponsible Adam, who is off racing the gazelles or some such thing, has apparently spaced out on God's telling him that Eve was coming this morning, and so they are sitting around chatting and waiting for Adam's return:<br />\\" 'I'm glad you like it. It's linen, Eve, a piece of linen cloth.'<br />\\" 'How did you make it?' I asked.<br />\\" 'Oh, I just waved a finger.' God turned back to the Serpent. 'What a boy,' he said, raising both hands in the air. 'Not very bright, mind you, but that's not important. He's the first, you know, my first try, so he's not perfect. But he's beautiful--you must see him run--and he's a nice boy, kindhearted, and good with his hands. I have had fun with him; you can't imagine.<br />\\" 'I can,' said the Serpent, glancing at me. But I was watching God. God who was able to create cloth simply by waving a finger in the air; what power he must have! I shivered.<br />\\" 'But it's very tiring,' God went on. 'He takes a long time with his lessons and seems to have trouble remembering names, and he doesn't always pay attention. And for some reason I can't fix him by waving a finger.' The Serpent coughed. God frowned. 'What's the matter with you? You're always coughing. You never did that before.<br />\\" 'Just a little dust in my throat,' said the Serpent. 'Go on.'<br />\\" 'The boy can't sit still, either. He wiggles his toes and plays with his hair until it drives me crazy.'<br />\\" 'Mmph,' said the Serpent thoughtfully.<br />\\" 'And his balls,' said God.<br />\\" 'What?' said the Serpent.<br />\\" 'His balls. He plays with his balls.'<br />\\"The Serpent lifted the front of his body into the air. 'What does he do with them.'<br />\\" 'He play with them all the time. All the time. Bounces them about!'<br />\\"The Serpent raised its head farther and widened its eyes. 'That's quite a trick. How does he do it?'<br />\\" 'From hand to hand, back and forth, to and fro, while I'm trying to explain things like the solar system.'<br />\\" 'Well,' said the Serpent, blinking. 'He sounds like quite an accomplished and original young man.'<br />\\" 'Yes, he's good with his hands,' God repeated. 'Look at this woodwork!' God waved at the porch with its carved columns. 'And he loves to make those balls I told you about. I must admit it's difficult work, with his big hands. But he makes lots of them, small ones, large ones. He weaves reeds together for the cover and stuffs them with bits of wool or seeds. They are wonderful balls, and they bounce very well. He's fascinated by them. I only wish he'd put as much time and interest into learning.'<br />\\" 'Oh. Of course,' said the Serpent. It sank into its coils, coughing.<br />\\" 'There you go again, said God. 'You should take something for it; try honey. Anyway,' he continued, 'when I ask Adam questions, he acts as if he's never heard the subject before. \\"What?\\" he'll say. \\"A planet? Nine planets? What's a planet?\\" as if we hadn't been talking and eating and sleeping planets for days.'<br />\\" 'It must be very trying for you,' said the Serpent.' \\"<br />There certainly is humor in THE GARDEN, a tale of what happened in the Garden of Eden told from Eve's point of view. But there is so much more. The God we meet is loving, but also stubborn, and impatient, and prideful. He has a terrible time dealing with the notion that the creatures He made in his own image have taken on lives of their own.<br />\\" 'What are the important things?' I asked. It seemed to me that everything I had learned was important.<br />\\"God frowned. 'Eve, you must learn not to interrupt! Serpent, I'm surprised you allow it!'<br />\\" 'I find the interruptions are often the most productive moments,' said the Serpent.<br />\\"God hunched his shoulders as if he found the idea incomprehensible, and turned backto me. 'Eve, in the next few weeks I will teach you the correct view of the world and the correct view of me. You must learn to appreciate what it means, that I created the world and all the animals and the birds and the fish, all the insects, everything! God waved his hands at the landscape behind us, which Adam and I could not see. A wasp circled around his head, and he waved it away. 'I created you, both of you! Adam and Eve!'<br />\\" 'And the linen, I said.' \\"<br />God sets off the complex series of events when he orders Adam to force himself upon Eve, making the \\"first time\\" horribly traumatic for both Adam and Eve. Furious about God's lack of patience and understanding, the Serpent takes Eve home, insisting that God and Adam stay away from her for six moons. During that time the Serpent and Eve embark upon a series of secret explorations outside the safe confines of the Garden.<br />My ninth grader reads everything these days with an overly-critical eye.

God waved his hands at the landscape behind us, which Adam and I could not see. A wasp circled around his head, and he waved it away. 'I created you, both of you! Adam and Eve!'<BR>\\" 'And the linen, I said.' \\" <br />God sets off the complex series of events when he orders Adam to force himself upon Eve, making the \\"first time\\" horribly traumatic for both Adam and Eve. Furious about God's lack of patience and understanding, the Serpent takes Eve home, insisting that God and Adam stay away from her for six moons. During that time the Serpent and Eve embark upon a series of secret explorations outside the safe confines of the Garden. <br />My ninth grader reads everything these days with an overly-critical eye. This was the first thing I've seen her truly passionate about in months. Her copy was passed on to an eighth grade fantasy reader, who devoured 200 pages overnight, and came into class yesterday smiling and exclaiming that, \\"They're going to have to put that author into the Witness Protection Program.\\" <br />THE GARDEN is a both an enchanting story and a powerful, incredibly thought-provoking book. Ms. Aidinoff's characterizations of Adam and Eve will prompt great discussions concerning the roots of \\"maleness\\" and \\"femaleness.\\" It will also instigate debates about parenting styles and about freewill. <br />THE GARDEN is sure to germinate fields full of thoughtful reader reaction.

All around us the soldiers use books as pillows, the pages red with blood.  There are men with bandages over missing eyes, missing legs, missing hands, and missing arms.  There are men with bandages wrapped around so much of them it looks to be that it's just those loose cotton rags, turned brown from the old blood, that are holding them together.<br />\\"Two soldiers tell Buck and me to step aside while they haul a man up front and lay him across a table that was meant to be a teacher's desk.  A doctor with a bloody butcher's apron looks at the man's arm, which is split open down the side, and the blood drains into the pool under the table.  Just behind the table is a pile of arms and legs, legs that still have on socks and shoes like they are fixing to walk on out of there by themselves.  The doctor picks up a saw.\\"<br /><br />A reader might quickly note that things are different these days.  That is true.  War still results in missing eyes, missing legs, missing hands, and missing arms, but the wounded and dying are treated with much better drugs and much cleaner bandages in much better facilities.  (And if they live, Halliburton will provide them a meal for which they charge US taxpayers an arm and a leg.)<br /><br />\\"We hear shouting and carrying on and we go have ourselves a look-see.<br />\\"Sheriff Matkin is locking leg irons around the ankles of one of our own men.<br />\\" 'Deserter.'

Shari and I have both lost our moms to It during the past five years. Everyone, from rock stars to relatives, old friends to infamous assassins get It. Sometimes, even kids.<br />\\"All I wanted to do was sneak back to my old desk and pretend that nothing had ever happened.<br />\\"Going back to school after being treated for cancer wasn't like the first day after summer vacation. I didn't think any teachers would ask me to write an essay on what I did on my chemotherapy vacation.\\"<br />Hawaiian teenager Rell DeMello has survived It. Across the ocean in the San Francisco hospital where she'd lived and had been treated over the past year, there are kids--including Rell's best friend--who are dying from It. But Rell is counting the eyelashes which have grown back, adjusting her wig, and returning to the high school where everyone knows what she has been up to since leaving unexpectedly.<br />\\" 'Good luck, Sweetheart,' Mom yelled from the car.<br />\\"I looked back. She waved and threw me a kiss like she was the grand marshall of the Mother Love Parade.<br />\\" 'Smile, Rell,' I told myself. 'Just smile.'<br />Kailua High School's two-story building looked like a towering castle. I climbed the steps, working my way through swarms of kids getting in a last blast of a CD or a last grinding kiss. I hugged my backpack to my chest to keep anyone from bumping into me.<br />\\"It was like they were in a fast-forward video and I was in slow motion. I got to the door, put my hand on the handle, turned and walked down the steps and straight to McDonald's, where I spent the rest of the day.\\"<br />In a world of friends and boys and papers due Thursday, Rell is dealing with thoughts and feelings that her Hawaiian friends just cannot understand, powerful dreams that she dare not share with them, and the fear that It will show up again, or will soon kill L.B. back in San Francisco.<br />\\"...And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able...\\"<br />Another complication of Rell's moving forward is the fact that:<br />\\"I was an only child--the only one who could be blamed for drawing cows on the wall or feeding peanut butter to the dog. No brothers, no sisters, no one to distract Mom and Dad from me or my cancer.\\"<br />This makes things even worse for Rell when her mom becomes a control freak and her dad fruitlessly demands that assurance that his kid won't have to face It again.<br />\\" 'Tell her, David,' Mom said.<br />\\"Dad turned down the stove and put the spatula down. 'Your mother read about a veterinarian who quit taking care of dogs because he had Hodgkin's disease.'<br />\\" 'So?'<br />\\" 'Having a dog may be a serious health risk for you.' He sounded apologetic.<br />\\" 'You must be kidding?' I turned to Mom.<br />\\" 'Rell, you have to be aware of the risks,' Mom said.<br />\\" 'I cannot believe this.' I looked to Dad for help.<br />\\" 'Hear your mother out on this, Rell,' he said.<br />\\"I threw my hands up in the air.<br />\\" 'Dogs carry a virus,' she said. 'It's the virus that's the concern. It can kill you,' Mom said.<br />\\" 'Bacon can kill me. Eggs can kill me.'<br />\\" 'Rell, you don't know what having a dog in the house, letting him sleep with you, having him lick you can do. You don't know what you're risking,' Mom said.\\"<br />STARING DOWN THE DRAGON is painfully realistic. The manner in which it is written with an abundance of dialogue gives the story an immediacy that flings the reader into the seat of the roller coaster that is Rell's life.<br />A minor quibble with the book is that the occasional error in punctuation makes you think you're reading an advance copy, but such errors are easily forgiven in light of the strength of the story Rell shares with us.<br />Knowledge often brings understanding and compassion and acceptance to that which was previously unknown. Readers of STARING DOWN THE DRAGON will certainly gain an understanding of the disease's psychological effects on those suffering from or recovering from it, and Its effects on those around them.<br />Richie Partington<br />[...]<br />BudNotBuddy@aol.comn those around them. <br />Richie Partington<BR>[...]<BR>BudNotBuddy@aol.com	2004-04-28

Thanks to her father's getting his dream job, Kate is forced to leave her friends and her Manhattan-based Young Playwrights Showcase program in order to move with her family to the small town of Redford, Tennessee.  Arriving just in time for her junior year of high school, Kate is plopped down--Northern liberal sensibilities and all--into the midst of a townwide controversy concerning her school and the Confederate battle flag.  And upon first meeting him--under a library desk--Kate immediately falls head over heels for the aforementioned Jackson (Jack) Redford.  Jack--enlightened, gorgeous, and a drama aficionado--turns out to be the last surviving male descendent of both the town's slaveholding namesake and a long line of Redford men who'd proudly served in the military.<br /><br />You can imagine where Jackson's Southern-born and bred mother fits into this mix.<br /><br />Whether it's Kate's attempt at creating a relationship with Jack, her stepping into the middle of the flag debate, or her struggle to compose a meaningful play about the deepening controversy, she becomes immersed in the baggage of a community where so many people--young and old--are descended from either Confederate soldiers or slaves, and also from recent generations whose bitter division during the Civil Rights Movement has left Redford with some even less healed wounds.<br /><br />\\" 'Back in those days, Lucas Roberts was a student at Fisk.  He and nine other students walked right through the front door of Jimmy Mack's.  The boys wore jackets and ties.  The girls wore lovely dresses.  They took seats at two tables and waited.  All the white people were served. But those ten young people were ignored.  So they sat there all day, in silence.'<br />\\"I stopped her, checked my tape to be sure it was recording properly, and then restarted it.  'Go on, please,' I urged her.  'What happened?'<br />\\" 'Well, when Jimmy Mack III closed at the end of the day, these young students came outside to find white folks lined up on the sidewalk cursing them and waving the Confederate battle flag.<br />\\"My hand flew to my mouth.  'That's disgusting.'<br />\\" 'Yes.  It is.  But in the long run, the black students won.'<br /><br />It was only earlier this month that I read an Associated Press article about a town in Virginia whose school board's policy preventing children from wearing clothes to school depicting the Confederate flag had resulted in suspensions, statewide protests, and livid parents demanding that their children be given the right to celebrate their ancestry.<br /><br />\\" 'I'm ashamed that my ancestors owned slaves.  But that doesn't mean I'm not still proud of them, because I am.  They were honorable men, for a different time.  And they put love of country ahead of whatever they wanted for themselves.  Can you understand that?  Can you?' \\"<br /><br />The authors certainly made the most of their decade of living in Nashville to create a spectrum of complex characters and believable dialogue.  They have now adapted this story for the stage, and I'd sure love to have the opportunity to see one of the productions that is already scheduled.<br /><br />A HEART DIVIDED is a provocative and satisfying book that will inspire passionate debate--both above and below the Mason-Dixon line--about racial and regional issues and the attendant pain that continues to remain a part of our nation's character.<br /> (...).ur nation's character.<BR> (...).	2004-04-18

If book awards were given to characters the way Oscars are given to actors, then the smartass Monkey would be a shoe-in for Supporting Character of the Year.  This exciting, humorous, and meticulously crafted book, an absolute piece d'resistance, is written by a highly respected children's book editor under her married name and contains not a single out-of-place word.  Our most experienced middle school fantasy reader, who thoroughly enjoyed the tale, noted that it borrows heavily from Chinese legends.  I have no experience with those legends, but found THE SIGN OF THE QIN to be an absolute delight to read and savor.  I look forward to rereading it next year before the second book in the trilogy appears.	2004-04-04

After a while, your new identity became second nature, as if you'd always been like you were now.<br />\\"The difficult part was managing and keeping apart all the different people you had to become.\\"<br />INVENTING ELLIOT is a smart psychological YA thriller set in a private high school in which Elliot, a scarred victim of bullying at his previous schools, is given the chance to start over in a place where nobody knows him, and then finds that his careful efforts at creating himself a new image lead to his being adopted into the heart of the students' secret power structure where he is offered the opportunity to mete out the kind of arbitrary, sadistic punishment to vulnerable classmates that he himself had been subjected to in his previous life. Elliot's constant fear is that any reluctance to play the game will lead to his once again becoming a victim himself.<br />As most of us can imagine, being in his position means that Elliot will merely be trading one living hell for another. Elliot's deep fears, artfully hidden behind his newly minted veneer, are infectious. I was thoroughly on edge as I followed Elliot page by page.<br />\\"When I'm in the shower<br />I'm afraid to wash my hair<br />'Cause I might open my eyes<br />And find someone standing there\\"<br />--Rockwell, \\"Somebody's Watching Me\\"<br />Not having read 1984 since well back on the other side of that year, I was intrigued by the prominent role that Orwell's book plays in this story, with two schoolmates presenting their radically contrasting impressions of the book to Elliot. Through those contrasting visions put forth by his characters, the author provides additional fuel for Elliot's internal struggle, as well as tools for the reader to begin considering why the dynamics of bullying exist in schools and possibly why people in the larger society forever crap on each other as if it's an inherent part of being human.<br />INVENTING ELLIOT asks more questions than it answers.

By melding remnants of childhood joy and innocence with the bitter bleakness of life and death in filthy alleys and dumpsters, Todd Strasser has written a story that will be the root of nightmares, prolonged discussions and, hopefully, change.	2004-03-31

Huseyin is hired to serve as the superintendent of building for the fictitious, late-1500s construction feat that is chronicled in David Macaulay's MOSQUE. To read David's dedication, \\"For my children and their children's children\\" is to get but an inkling of the temporal scale we must learn to think in when discussing the subject matter. This is a book which can quite handily serve as the front step for a comprehensive study of the Islamic religion, or of the Ottoman empire, or of what is going on today. And while the impeccable work of David Macaulay is no secret to any of us, this focus on the magnificent vision, the mathematical beauty, and detailed craftsmanship inherent in these structures sacred to a large part of the world, is a wonderful way to begin educating children (and their parents) about that which most of the West is so ignorant. (I am sad to say that as I read MOSQUE during half-time at a freshman basketball game yesterday, someone's parent leaned over and muttered, \\"Yeah, mosques, that's where they hide the weapons of mass destruction.\\")<br />Throughout the book we're treated to those illustrations for which David Macaulay is so well known and loved: from large overviews of the overall project as it rises from the ground, down to detailed views of creating stained glass windows, bricks, forged iron grilles, perfectly rounded arches, and the Muezzins' balcony.<br />The what?<br />Yes, that's another great thing about MOSQUE. We are provided with a whole series of new \\"languages,\\" involving architecture and the Islamic culture. And not only do we see how the project is laid out so that the worshippers are facing Mecca when they pray, but we also get to see the balconies, the bakeries, the bathrooms and the bath house.<br />Not a picture book for little kids, MOSQUE is an entertaining and info-packed illustrated introduction to a world different from our own--temporally, geographically, and culturally--which we learn is not all so different as some would want us to think.hes, and the Muezzins' balcony. <br />The what? <br />Yes, that's another great thing about MOSQUE.

Three longtime girlfriends in high school--Emily, Lydia, and Cassie--who are connected through parents who went to law school together, are each required to become penpals with guys in a cross-town school with a bad reputation.  The story is told primarily through these letters back and forth, along with some journal entries, and a hysterically funny fill-in-the-blanks writing workbook that Lydia's dad has given her.<br />I'd considered myself pretty waterlogged from the publishers' wave of girl-writes-a-journal books of the past few years, but this is a horse of an entirely different flavor.  I'm sure there are some great lessons to be garnered from this book, but, above all, I found it to be a totally delightful read.  And the author's background as an attorney is certainly put to good (comedic) use.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure what more to say about the book.<br /><br />But being away for a couple of days up in the middle of the (cold, snowy) Sierras this week, with nothing to do at night, I found myself rereading it like it was comfort food.  And it's as good as leftover lasagna the second time around.  For one thing, I caught many of those little clues concerning who did what that I'd missed the first time through.  But, more importantly, I understood all the Emily-isms that I wasn't clear about on the first go round.<br /><br />In the same way that non-Americans might find it a bit more difficult to understand the wisdom of Yogi Berra or the rapid-fire dialogue in a Marx Brothers movie, I wasn't sure on the first read exactly what was Emily and what was the English language as it is spoken Down-Under.  But the second time I understood what the author has accomplished in creating the wacky voice of this young woman who longs to be a lawyer someday:<br /><br />\\"I am not saying that this is true.  I am only giving a hyperactive situation of how you might give offense.\\"<br />\\" 'You must have dislocated it.  Try looking again.' \\"<br />\\"I was just nom-plussed...\\"<br />\\"I decided to use this opportunity to practice my handwriting.

I think it is an angiogram of Thompson, actually.\\"<br />\\"I can't explain how beautiful the singing was because you can't write music.\\"<br />\\"We need to cook on the element of surprise.\\"<br />\\"It's immortal keeping a secret.\\"<br />\\"...he says that schools which are close to one another should forge ties, and I hope you are as keen as I am to get started with the forgery.\\"<br />\\"Hyperbole is something to do with graphs.

For instance, in the &quot;playing with&quot; pages, there are lines for favorite games, books, and songs, as well as television shows and videos that are permissible for the child to watch, and play date guidelines.<br /><br />&quot;In ev'ry job that must be done<br />There is an element of fun<br />you find the fun and snap!<br />The job's a game&quot;  --&quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot; from Walt Disney's Mary Poppins<br /><br />I am particularly impressed by the amount of focus the author devotes to communication with both the parents and with the child.

And, as a former childcare professional, I am delighted with Murkoff's repeatedly providing all sorts of strategies for turning routine moments into educational experiences for the child, whether it be activities that are part of feeding, playing, bathing, or cleanup.<br /><br />Undoubtedly there are untold numbers of childcare professionals and teachers whose careers begin when they take care of neighborhood kids after school or on Friday nights.

Teachers go out of their way to continually and purposefully bait the teens and then punish them.  An administrator gives a week's detention when one of the teens complains that he can't open the combination lock on his locker.  A coach passively observes his team leave practice temporarily to tear the two teens apart and then doesn't even come to see whether the two get seriously hurt.  The parents relentlessly treat them in a hateful manner...and one of the parents conveniently leaves a large cashe of firearms lying around.<br />Of course, it all goes back to the pool party at age six when one of the teens was stripped, locked in the pool shed, and photographed naked by older children.  The mother supervising the party tells the boy's mother: &quot;Poor Edwin had a hard time today.&quot;<br />There is an incredibly wide chasm between Young Adult fiction and this rambling piece of rubbish.

Many aspects of Americans' personal behavior have changed in recent years. Crime is down. Teenage pregnancy is down. Drunk driving is down. Abortion is down. Opinion surveys suggest that Americans are growing more concerned about personal responsibility, as conservatives have narrowly defined that term. And much of the supposed 'deviance' that conservatives have anguished about for a quarter century has been waning.<br />\\"Still, cheating is up. Cheating is everywhere. By cheating I mean breaking the rules to get ahead academically, professionally, or financially. Some of this cheating involves violating the law, some does not. Either way, most of it is by people who, on the whole, view themselves as upstanding members of society. Again and again, Americans who wouldn't so much as shoplift a pack of chewing gum are committing felonies at tax time, betraying the trust of their patients, misleading investors, ripping off their insurance company, lying to their clients, and much more.<br />\\"Something strange is going on here. Americans seem to be using two moral compasses. One directs our behavior when it comes to things like sex, family, drugs, and traditional forms of crime. A second provides us ethical guidance in the realm of career, money, and success.<br />\\"The obvious question is: Where did we pick up that second compass?\\"<br />So asks David Callahan in this fascinating look at where we are headed in America. Led by doped-up sports icons, doctors with bogus prescriptions, auto repair guys who find more to fix then is really wrong, corrupt stockbrokers, and ready-to-buy politicians, the leaders of the parade are the corporate executives.<br />Of course, the amoral behavior by corporate executives is dictated by stockholders who, of course, are us and our parents and friends and our retirement portfolio managers.<br />So where are we all going?<br />\\"Cheating is not a new problem in the United States or anywhere else. It has existed in nearly every human society.<br />\\"In Ancient Greece, the Olympic games were rife with cheating. Athletes lied about their amateur status, competitions were rigged, judges were bribed. Those caught were forced to pay fines to a special fund used to set up statues of Zeus. Greece ended up with a lot of statues of Zeus.\\"<br />There are a set of interrelated influences that the author believes are the cause of the current cheating epidemic in America--the increased pressures of job competition and insecurity, the widening rewards gap between the winners and losers in our economic system, the relentless trend toward deregulation that enhances temptation, and the belief by so many people that the system is so utterly corrupt that they have no fair shot at attaining the American Dream in an ethical manner.<br />THE CHEATING CULTURE is an eye-opening introduction to the real world. It will enlighten high school students as to how their peers are adroitly eluding obstacles that might interfere with becoming rich, famous, powerful, and going to Disneyland. The only worry is deciding which is more effective: buying term papers online or paying tutors to write them for you; purchasing the proper mobile electronics to be able to secretly bring your answers into the classroom or having your parents line up a doctor who can sell you the learning disability diagnosis that will permit you more time to complete standardized tests.<br />\\"The choice between being a winner or a loser in an economy filled with inequities seems stark and frightening to many college students. Says one student: 'Grades are the most important things which judge whether you go to medical school or to work as a janitor.' \\"<br />It is not surprising that Callahan finds these same students go on to cheat in college, grad school and--for those who thus successfully navigate their way to and through the sidewalks of the Ivy League--in a business world where untold riches can be scooped up at the expense of a gullible public that is unprotected by a deregulated, corporate-lobbied government.d up at the expense of a gullible public that is unprotected by a deregulated, corporate-lobbied government.	2004-02-02

Written by the Exhibition and Program Curator of the National Gallery in London, it is illustrated by Lauren Child who is well known around here after winning the 2003 California Young Reader Medal in the Primary Category for I WILL NEVER EVER EAT A TOMATO.<br /><br />Dan is a skateboard kid who happens upon an art museum and is checking it out when the unexpected occurs:<br /><br />\\"The walls were covered with paintings full of strange and beautiful things.  Some seemed to tell stories, but he couldn't work out what the stories were.<br />\\" 'You can't read paintings like you can read books,' he sighed.<br />\\" 'You can read this one,' a voice said.  It seemed to come from a painting of an angel talking to a woman.\\"<br /><br />That angel speaking to Dan is Gabriel and the painting is Fra Angelico's The Annunciation.  Gabriel splits the painting and leads Dan on a tour of some well-known works to explain how artists tell stories using symbolic images.  From Belshazzar's Feast and Botticelli's Venus and Mars to Picasso and Pollack, we see examples of artists deliberately utilizing such symbols as colors and animals, bubbles and flowers.<br /><br />Alas, the tour ends because the museum guard is once again after the oft-missing angel, and Gabe heads back to where he belongs--in the painting.  There is a good dose of visual humor--such as Gabriel on Dan's skateboard--and Lauren Child uses her own symbolic images within Dan's story.<br /><br />This book will also serve as a great stepping stone to later important lessons of symbolism in literature.<br /><br />Richie Partington<br />[...]<br />BudNotBuddy@aol.comses her own symbolic images within Dan's story.  <BR> <BR>This book will also serve as a great stepping stone to later important lessons of symbolism in literature.<BR> <BR>Richie Partington<BR>[...]<BR>BudNotBuddy@aol.com	2003-12-22

Set among the San Juan Islands of the Pacific Northwest in the autumn of 1889, the main character, Clem (Clementine) Nesbitt, is a long-limbed, thirteen year-old girl without formal education who has a knack for writing lists that sound like poetry and who had arrived in the world immediately upon her parent's arrival from Scotland. Living on a relatively sheltered island, she's as handy with her seventeen-foot dory, the Fisherbird, as most kids are today with their mountain bikes.<br />\\"As she sat, stunned, a burst of bubbles rose to the surface beside the Fisherbird. She leaned over the side of her boat. Something large and brown was sinking slowly...Clem grabbed the metal hook secured to a long pole that she used for hooking large fish. She jabbed the pole down through the water as far down as she could reach, just snagging the sinking lump. The heavy mass caught hard so that Clem had to brace her legs against the boat to hold onto the end of the pole. Her grip was fragile, and Clem felt her hands grow slick with sweat. She was afraid that at any moment the pole would slide out of her hand, letting whatever it was sink into the grasping currents of deep water. \\"Clem pulled the pole as hard as she could, hand over hand. She heard herself grunt with muscle strain until she could raise the mass. Slowly it began to surface. More bubbles escaped, and Clem could see whatever she held was wrapped in burlap. \\"As the wet fabric hit the air,Clem fell to her knees and leaned over the water to grab it. To her shock, through the rip made by the grappling hook, a hand suddenly thrust out and grabbed on to her wrist, pulling her to the edge of the Fisherbird.\\"<br />That hand is attached to a nearly-dead middle-aged Chinese immigrant, Tong-Ling, who is a victim of the Expulsion Act and of that sweltering atmosphere of extreme anti-Chinese sentiment during the late 1800s that spawned such laws. The irony, in the case of Tong Ling, is that he is being demonized daily as an unwelcome foreigner by \\"real\\" Americans who have been in the country less than half the time that he has. (Not to say that life-long Americans of Chinese descent were being treated any better.)<br />\\"...Clem saw the wave coming. She knew even before it hit that it would come right over their bow. 'Bail!' she yelled\\"<br />This fast-plotted tale opens shortly after the suspicious death of Clem's Uncle Doran's business partner. The two other young characters in the story are Jed, the easy-going, competent young boy, and Sarah, the educated and attractive (prissy and stuck-up, to Clem's way of thinking) daughter of the dead business partner. As she is forced into dealing with Sarah, Clem experiences feelings of incompetence, inferiority, and jealousy that readers will identify with.<br />Furthermore, FLIGHT OF THE FISHERBIRD provides young readers with an absorbing story about prejudice in US history and will hopefully cause those students to begin connecting that dreadful sentiment of the past with the problems involving intolerance of those who are \\"different\\" which are still occurring today.o her wrist, pulling her to the edge of the Fisherbird.\\" <br />That hand is attached to a nearly-dead middle-aged Chinese immigrant, Tong-Ling, who is a victim of the Expulsion Act and of that sweltering atmosphere of extreme anti-Chinese sentiment during the late 1800s that spawned such laws.

The book is absolutely saturated with vivid photographs of the ninety-two year-old artist's work, as well as a progression of photos of Louise throughout a life that spanned nearly the entire twentieth century and has continued on into the new millennium. Louise's story--from a childhood in France to an apartment in Manhattan--encompasses family, creativity, and personal evolution, as well as her historic role in breaking down sexual barriers in the art world.<br />But what makes RUNAWAY GIRL such an important piece of nonfiction for young adults is that unique peek at the psychological roots of an artist's creativity. Greenberg & Jordan provide the perfect measure of Louise's early years in order for us to understand those roots without ever getting bogged down in extraneous detail. The extensive access to her inner life that this controversial artist has granted the authors and their readers makes the book inspiring and unique. I didn't expect to enjoy a book about some female artist I'd never heard of before, but to find out why some two-story-high spiders represent her mother and herself totally captivated me.<br />\\"From one of Louise Bourgeois's journals:<br />The Runaway Girl who never grew up.<br />I need no support nor comfort.<br />I need no safety net, no breakfast.<br />No lunch or tea, no visitors, no telephone calls nor little messages.<br />No little concerts, no hype, or encouragement for big projects.<br />No ambitions, no spying on my neighbors.<br />I need nothing...I can wait, I am not afraid, I am an adult.<br />Nothing is lacking.\\"<br />It is also fascinating to see little snippets of the artist at work. For instance, the authors describe her creation of one of my favorite pieces of her art:<br />\\"She would go back to [the marble quarries in] Pietranta many times in the sixties and again in the eighties. Jerry Gorovoy, who accompanied her on one such trip, says there wasn't much time for sightseeing. They arrived at their hotel in the evening and instead of going to a restaurant or walking around town, she insisted on getting right to work. Jerry says that Louise had a hard time relaxing. 'If you take her to the beach, she can sit still for about five minutes. Then she gets restless.' Unfortunately, Louise hadn't packed any art supplies--no clay, wax or Plasticine. So she asked Jerry for the shirt off his back. She folded and shaped it, stitching the cotton into position until she was satisfied with the form. The next day at the quarry she changed the design somewhat, then applied gesso, a liquid plaster, to harden the fabric. A larger, marble version was measured and roughed out by the craftsmen at the quarry according to her specifications. Then it was shipped to the studio [in Brooklyn], where, upon her return, she carefully reworked it with a chisel. Eventually Jerry's shirt evolved into Femme Maison, 1983, a fresh interpretation of her familiar subject.\\"<br />RUNAWAY GIRL concludes with a variety of useful resources, including \\"How to Look at a Sculpture,\\" and \\"Where to View Artwork by Louise Bourgeois,\\" as well as an expansive glossary, a bibliography, and a chronological listing of her work.<br />\\" What happens next? That is her main focus. And so she stays at home on Twentieth Street, spinning her memories, fantasies, and ideas into art. Free with her thoughts and feelings, up to a point, she lets us know that there are other secrets, other ideas and thoughts to consider about her, about her work. 'I'm a long distance runner. I'm a lonely runner and that's the way I like it.' \\"<br />It was a delight to \\"meet\\" Louise.

J.T., this one's for you!<br />\\"We built countless ramps with old boards laid on barrels or boxes, at the bottom of a hill if possible, and we would try to jump over things with our bikes.<br />\\"Remember, these were one-speed fat-tired bikes with a crowned-up, castrating brace bar and the things we tried to jump were fences, wooden walls, barrels, bikes, each other. On one memorable occasion Alan--after carefully calculating distances and angles--tried to jump his stepfather's Ford coupe end to end. He didn't...quite...make it and left a face print on the windshield of the car, but that might have been because he was distracted by the scream when his mother came out just as we finished the ramp and Alan made his jump...\\"<br />Now, I can remember some of the \\"really neat stuff\\" we did when I was young: There was a telephone cable hanging from a wooden utility pole in this vacant lot filled with mounds of dirt left over from digging foundations in he neighborhood. It made for great swinging (&agrave; la George of the Jungle) until Jimmy Dean got a concussion by swinging straight into the pole. There was \\"skitching\\" --kids in Beatle boots grabbing onto the back bumper of any car that was cruising through the snow-slickened parking lot behind Modell's. I can also recall the thrill of aiming our banana bikes full speed over the edge and down the big drop-off at Sunshine Acres Park. But my sitting here today (in one piece) attests to the fact that I did NOT spend my impressionable years hanging out with Gary Paulsen and his buddies:<br />\\"Alan, again after carefully calculating and measuring..., decided that if you got up to twenty-six miles an hour and angled a ramp to ensure (that's how he put it, 'to ensure') that you got at least seven point six feet in the air, it was possible to do a complete backward somersault and land on your wheels upright. Alan, having gotten at least seven feet in the air after a screaming run down Black Hill, landed exactly, perfectly upside down, bicycle wheels straight up, spinning, in a cloud of dust and gravel.\\"<br />Decorating the cover of HOW ANGEL PETERSON GOT HIS NAME AND OTHER OUTRAGEOUS TALES ABOUT EXTREME SPORTS is an illustration of a young man on snow skis. He is wearing one of those old leather flight helmets (&agrave; la Snoopy) and flight goggles, and he is being pulled through the snow behind a sporty automobile that dates back to my father's adolescence. The young man is Angel Peterson who in 1954, inspired by a newsreel proceeding the Saturday matinee, decided he'd break the speed record for skiing despite being a thousand miles from any hills. Such was passion for scientific curiosity (and impressing girls) amid the \\"Brain Trust\\" that hung out with the young Gary Paulsen.<br />\\"Alan tried once more, getting a lift from an unsuspecting truck by hanging on to the rear corner and hitting the ramp so fast that it gave way and he went through it like a tank, barrels and boards and splinters flying everywhere.\\"<br />\\"Wayne completed the only true backward flip off a bicycle but he didn't take the bike with him...\\"<br />Of course Shari, ever-the-mom, shakes her head, appalled by what I'm reading her from the book--a sure sign that this book will be absolutely worshiped by young boys. (Shari says that's why I like the book so much.) No, really, it's a book for girls, too. (Rosemary, who can tell you about trying to bounce through the air from the trampoline to the rope hanging from the tree, is going to love this one.) In fact, the only fault that I can find with the book is its size: One hundred and eleven pages is way too brief for so funny a book. Guess I'll just have to read it again...right after I take my government surplus target kite out in the next heavy wind and see if I can...urplus target kite out in the next heavy wind and see if I can...	2003-11-30

Running away from her latest disaster, she finds herself in the small prairie town of Pembina Lake. There she becomes the catalyst for change among all the story's other impeccably drawn characters, ranging from five year-old Seth to septuagenarian Dolores. The old caf&eacute; in town where newly-arrived Noreen takes shelter from the storm is symbolic of the characters in Pembina Lake--they too are going to rot away and collapse if this obnoxious teenager doesn't tear at their edges as she does with the caf&eacute; wallpaper.<br />This is a remarkable story with just a couple of settings, amazing dialogue, and portraits of a small town that frequently made me shiver the way I did when first reading Steinbeck's 1930's descriptions of Salinas.	2003-11-30

One grey summer morning, in 1722, my wish was granted, but not quite in the way that I would have wanted.\\"<br />Celia Rees's PIRATES! is a spicy blend of adventure, history, greed, loyalty, danger, sisterhood, (and pants), involving two young women--one who has been born into wealth in Britain, the other into slavery in Jamaica--in the early 1700s.<br />Nancy Kington, the wealthy merchant's daughter whose mother died giving birth to her, narrates the story. It begins with the sordid events through which her brother's gambling costs the family its fortune and how, shortly thereafter on his death bed, Nancy's father schemes with her brothers to restore their wealth. Unbeknownst to her at the time, Nancy is made the bartering chip for consummating that deal.<br />\\"My father was a sugar merchant and a trader in slaves. He owned plantations in Jamaica, and that's where I was bound, but I had not been told the why or wherefore of it. My father's dying wish, that was all my brothers would say. I was not yet sixteen years old, and a girl, so I was neither asked, nor consulted. They assumed I was stupid. But I am far from that. I knew enough not to trust either of them and time was to prove me right. They had sold me as surely as any African they trafficked from the coast of Guinea.\\"<br />Nancy is a teenager you've gotta love. In contrast to the typical upbringing of British females of the time, she's been taught to read by Robert, the slave her father has brought back from his Jamaican holdings to maintain the household. (\\"My father saw no reason to pay a houseful of women to sit about clacking and gossiping and eating his food, their backsides getting fatter by the day.\\") Nancy's taught herself to letter and number by repeatedly copying documents in her father's office. She's picked up fencing from her big brother. Thanks to her father's permissiveness, she's grown up strong and feisty, romping in the sunshine on the quayside of Bristol:<br />When she arrives at her family's Jamaican plantations, she learns the real human cost of that sugar and \\"spice\\" whose sale had provided her comfortable childhood. And then, along with the adolescent slave girl Minerva Sharpe, whose job it is to care for her, Nancy discovers the heavy personal price that has been struck on her shoulder in exchange for allowing her brothers to maintain their privileged economic position. Neither willing to accept the deal worked out without her consent, nor willing to allow the behavior of the plantation's white men toward Minerva--who has rapidly become like a sister to her--the two young women together embark upon a path that eventually leads to a career \\"on the account,\\" a euphemism for piracy.<br />We follow Nancy and Minerva, both pursuing and being pursued, as they sail across the high seas, in and out of colonies and islands, storms, African settlements, and confederacies, accompanied by a spectacular collection of daring and dangerous characters.<br />\\" 'I put my faith in the stones,' he smiled at me across the table.

Zeke knew that even if Dwayne's phone were working, he wouldn't try calling him at eleven forty-five at night.<br />\\" 'What time do you close?' he asked the ticket agent.<br />\\" 'Long as the buses keep comin', I'm open,' the man in the wrinkled shirt said.<br />\\" 'Any objection to me waiting out the night in a chair over there?'<br />\\" 'What bus you waitin' on?'<br />\\" 'No bus. Had a change of plans, and my ride won't be here till morning.<br />\\" 'Well, you're welcome to a chair, but it can't be all that comfortable, seeing as how you just got off a bus. There's a hotel two blocks away--rooms half price after midnight. Real cheap and you won't get lice or nothing.'<br />\\"Zeke thought it over as the man gave directions. 'Out the door there, turn left, two blocks down, it'll be on the right.'<br />\\"A shower and a bed would feel good, Zeke decided. Why not?<br />\\"Once in the room, however, he could not sleep. He showered, put on his shorts and undershirt again, and crawled under the covers, but his body seemed restless, wired.<br />\\"At two thirty he got up, wrapped a blanket around him, and pulled his chair over to the window, looking out onto the street below--the neon sigh outside the hotel, the pool hall across the way, the occasional car, the stoplight at the corner, the little restaurant farther on, closed and locked for the night. He used to think of it as his town, but he didn't think like that anymore.\\"<br />\\"As eager as [Kate] had been to look out the [school bus] window before, she did not want to look now. Yet out of the corner of her eye, in the periphery, where trouble begins, she could make out the single cottonwood tree, then the Norton's barn...\\"<br />As I tell my own children and our students, I was in the lucky fifty percent: There was a fifty-fifty chance I was destined to kill myself or someone else, back when I was a high school student, and then a college student, who often drank and drove. All those times, and I never killed anybody. In fact, I never even got pulled over or dented a fender.<br />But there were certainly some nights when I was so blind drunk that I wouldn't have been able to remember the next morning even if I HAD been pulled over. As they say, \\"There but for the grace of God go I.\\"<br />Zeke, now 29, was not in the lucky fifty percent with me. It is March 1941, nine months before Pearl Harbor, and Zeke has just been released from prison early for good behavior, after spending three years incarcerated for a crime he cannot remember committing.<br />He was that drunk when it happened.<br />Kate is the still-bitter teenage daughter of the town's country doctor, whose mother was killed on the way home from choir practice when Zeke's car ran the stop sign near the Norton's barn. It took two hours to extricate her mother's body from the wreck. In Kate's mind, she would dearly love to give Zeke a couple of hours of his own medicine. And, as we can guess, Kate will somehow be given that opportunity.<br />\\"Hadn't anybody else ever made a mistake? Hadn't anyone else in the jury ever run a red light? Hadn't the judge ever rolled past a stop sign? The difference, of course, was that his mistake has cost a life, and he was sure sorry about that. But the fact was that any of their mistakes could have cost a life too. They just hadn't, that's all. He wasn't one whit a better man for having been in prison than he was before. Just a little angrier, that's all.<br />The catalyst for bringing Kate and Zeke into close range is a violent winter storm that really did take place--and took a tragic toll--in March 1941 in the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota.<br />\\"To Kate, it seemed that the wind was on fiercely intimate terms with her, licking at her eyelids with an insistent tongue, probing under the edge of the red flannel scarf as though trying to uncover her neck, forcing itself up the sleeves of her heavy jacket, despite the sweater she wore beneath. Kate kept going.\\"<br />It takes a killer blizzard for us to see the other side of Kate Sterling.

Over the years he developed and stuck to these writing rules.<br />\\"Good writing should be smooth, clear, and short, and the art of saying little in much must be avoided at all costs. In written discourse, every needless thing gives offense and must be eliminated...Had this always been done, many large and tiresome volumes would have shrunk into pamphlets, and many a pamphlet into a single period.\\"<br />It seems like a stream of new Benjamin Franklin biographies make their appearance as steadily as the changing of the seasons. That perception has caused my building a healthy skepticism concerning the need for just one more. But Candace Fleming has taken Ben's writing rules to heart. Less is more in BEN FRANKLIN'S ALMANAC, Fleming's continually entertaining and enlightening collection of quotes, anecdotes, illustrations, American history, and other tasty tidbits (including the occasional fish story) that the author has harvested from original source materials.<br />Rather than assembling a typical chronological tome, Fleming has grouped this assortment of goodies into an eye-catching patchwork format that is clumped around eight themes: Boyhood Memories, The Family Album, The Writer's Journal, Tokens of a Well-Lived Life, The Scientist's Scrapbook, Revolutionary Memorabilia, Souvenirs from France, and Final Remembrances.<br />\\"All his life Ben tried to do what was right. His daily routine reminded him to put mankind's problems before his own.<br />\\"I rose at five each morning, and addressed Powerful Goodness [Ben's name for God] with the same question: What Good Shall I Do Today? I then studied and planned my day until eight, worked until twelve, dined and overlooked my account books until two, worked again until six when I had supper, music and conversation. At ten I examined my day. What Good Had I Done That Day?\\"<br />Not that he was perfect, or anything. As Ben noted, \\"With regards to places for things, papers, etc., I am a dismal failure.\\" And as Fleming reveals, while his genius included his being credited for so many important inventions including bifocals, he nonetheless lacked the vision to see that women should be accorded the same opportunities and rights as men:<br />\\"When his young friend Polly Stevenson talked of devoting herself to studying philosophy, Ben was appalled. 'Knowledge may be useful,' he warned her, 'but there is nothing of equal dignity and importance than being a good daughter, a good wife, a good mother.' Ben wondered why women needed the 'full Pandora's box of knowledge' opened to them. Instead, he argued, women should be taught useful and functional skills--reading, writing, and accounting. This, he claimed, 'stood them in good stead to be active, helpful partners in their husband's business.' \\"<br />And, speaking of errors, \\"Ben once invited a group of friends to an 'electrical picnic.' He planned to kill a turkey by 'electrical shock,' then roast it with 'electrical fire.' Unfortunately, he became so engrossed in conversation he forgot to pay close attention to what he was doing. He touched two wires together and zap! Ben received the shock instead of the turkey. His body vibrated from head to toe, and smoke curled from one buckled shoe. Luckily, he escaped with just a few bruises and a sore chest.\\"<br />Through the accumulated pieces of her collection, the author succinctly covers the well-trod life-of-Franklin: Ben's printing career, centered on his 26 years as writer and publisher of the annual Poor Richard's Almanack (the second-most read book in the Colonies), would by itself have insured Franklin's immortality. Then that aspect of his life was topped by the jaw-dropping string of inventions coupled with his instigation of public libraries, street lamps, quality postal service, and volunteer fire departments, which made him even more famous. And then, his involvement--the old guy with the fire in his belly--in producing the Declaration of Independence, followed by his pivotal role in the winning of the Revolution by persuading France to enter the fray when Washington's troops were on the verge of defeat, elevated Franklin to American sainthood. If that wasn't enough, he returned to America and (at 81 years old) helped formulate the Constitution.<br />But he STILL wasn't done!<br />\\"Saint\\" Ben had at one time been a slave owner. But while in England in the years preceding the Revolution, Franklin \\"found himself trying to defend America against charges of hypocrisy.\\" He had freed his slaves, observed \\"firsthand 'the natural capacities of the black race,' \\" and then, after ratification of the Constitution, he petitioned Congress on the subject of slavery:<br />\\"Noting Congress had been created to 'promulgate the welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the People of the United States,' he argued that this should be done 'without distinction of color,' since all people are created by the 'same Almighty Being, alike the objects of his care and equally designed for the enjoyment of happiness.' To tolerate less, Franklin argued, 'was to contradict the meaning of the Revolution.' \\"<br />If only Ben could have hung around for another decade in order to persuade the new nation of this argument, we might have had him to thank for the success of one more of his great ideas.<br />But thanks to the fine work of Candace Fleming, we at least have a thoroughly satisfying \\"true account of the good gentleman's life,\\" as well as one more important piece of ammunition in my argument that a real love and understanding of American history will much more readily come from trade books of this caliber than from standardized textbooks.fire in his belly--in producing the Declaration of Independence, followed by his pivotal role in the winning of the Revolution by persuading France to enter the fray when Washington's troops were on the verge of defeat, elevated Franklin to American sainthood.

Come on! Tell me you didn't feel totally great after all of Ursula's evil schemes were thwarted and the two young lovers got it together? STRAVAGANZA is even better, because you get all that intensity and scary stuff, but you also get seriously strong female characters who don't intend to put up with any of that \\"only boys can do it\\" nonsense, and who don't go meekly mooning about playing with their \\"whozits and whatzits galore.\\" And on top of that, to provide a truly feel-good happy ending to a book about a boy with a brain tumor is certainly one masterful feat in itself!<br />That boy, Lucien Mulholland, a young, 21st century resident of North London, is having a terrible time enduring chemo when his father turns him on to a salvaged old notebook with thin pages and a beautiful, marbled cover that comes from Venice. His father also tells Lucien stories of visiting that mysterious land of islands and canals in his own youth. But, when Lucien falls asleep and awakens in a Venice-like setting, it is not the city of his father's memory but, instead, a 1577 parallel version called Bellezza which is ruled by The Duchessa. Lucien's first contact in this new land is Arienna, a feisty girl his own age who has snuck into town dressed as a boy in order to be chosen to train as one of the Duchessa's mandoliers--the heralded guys who pole her royal mandolas (gondola-like crafts) around the city.<br />\\"I can't stand this indecision<br />Married with a lack of vision<br />Everybody wants to rule the world\\"<br />--Tears for Fears<br />There is a large cast involved in the palace intrigue that Lucien falls into when he unexpectedly arrives in Belezza. That intrigue involves a wealthy family trying to do in the Duchessa since she won't play ball and yield the City over to their megalomaniacal schemes. And don't think that the women have a monopoly on the smart-and-strong-yet-sensitive characters. Lucien acquires two great father figures in Belezza, one of whom speaks in Elizabethan English.<br />The title, STRAVAGANZA, comes from stravagation, the time travelling that Lucien practices. This joyful and magical tale is the first volume of a trilogy. Hopefully, by the time Mary Hoffman completes the second book CITY OF STARS, the word will be out big-time and young readers will join me in wishing they could be part of that world.family trying to do in the Duchessa since she won't play ball and yield the City over to their megalomaniacal schemes.

Every time the municipal generator breaks down, plunging Ember into utter blackness, the inhabitants hold their collective breaths--nobody certain whether those responsible for nursing it along will succeed in getting the generator started once again.<br />Also, what nobody seems to know--but what WE know from the Prologue--is that The Builders of Ember have left instructions for their descendants to depart The City two hundred years after its inception. Securing those instructions in a time-locked strongbox and entrusting that box to the succession of mayors, The Builders are long departed and the two twelve year-olds are still generations in the future when a dying Mayor unfortunately misplaces that box after unsuccessfully attempting to force it open.<br />THE CITY OF EMBER is a relatively simple read which is sure to unlock the door to extraordinary discussions relevant to today's headlines regarding power and corruption, fear, and war, as well as moral responsibilities and relationships between siblings, neighbors, friends, and those of individuals as part of a community. But most of all THE CITY OF EMBER is a thrilling and mysterious tale of two great preteens finding their way in the world.<br />Jeanne DuPrau is at work on the sequel--PEOPLE OF SPARKS--and I'll be waiting anxiously to hear more of the story of Lina, Doon, and The City of Ember.	2003-11-30

Set in 1837 in Millbrook, Massachusetts--a decade prior to Seneca Falls, and a quarter-century before the Emancipation Proclamation--and narrated in alternating chapters by Faith's brother and nine of her neighbors, it is a captivating snapshot of patriarchal America in the early years of the long (and ongoing) struggle to make things fair for all folks who live in the \\"Land of the Free.\\"<br />\\" 'Why shouldn't girls want to learn about something that's interesting?'<br />\\" Even Celia Tanner picked up her head to listen.<br />\\" 'Well, they just can't, Miss Fisher. It's just not done,' Amos Read said, dismissing Betsy.<br />\\" 'Well, why not?' asked Faith. She moved close to Amos, thrusting her face right up to his, right next to the glasses and the milky blue eyes.<br />\\"Amos Read cleared his throat. 'You see, Faith,' he said, parading before the boys. 'Studying geometry requires logical deduction.<br />\\"Now Amos waved an arrogant finger in the air. 'One must be able to see that one thing leads to another. From a plane figure, say, to a quadrilateral and then to a square or a rhombus. And so forth. Geometry's logical. It makes sense.<br />\\" 'So why can't girls learn to make use of its good sense, too?'<br />\\"Amos turned sharply to face Faith. His spectacles glinted harshly against the light. The master was growing angry.<br />\\" 'Everybody knows why not,' he said haughtily, backing away from Faith and nodding at the boys. 'Women are flighty. Illogical. Everybody knows they haven't the logical capacities.'<br />\\"Faith bristled. 'Everybody knows? I hate those words. Can \\"everybody\\" prove that girls don't have this logical capacity?'<br />\\" 'Well, they don't have to prove it. You don't have to prove things that everybody knows!' Now Master Read stamped his foot. I knew what the stamp meant: Amos was dismissing her. 'Obviously it's quite impossible for girls to study geometry,' he said, warming to his own words. 'Completely impossible, in fact. Besides,' Amos added with authority, 'the kind of learning you are asking to acquire is even forbidden by the Bible. The prohibition is in First Timothy.' \\"<br />Faith's grandfather is a retired Congregationalist minister, her father a Methodist minister. An important aspect of the story is the effect that Faith's activism has on her mother. Emma Common is an Everywoman character. She is caught on one side by love and obedience for her father and her husband as well as by the way things have always been. On the other side are the clearly justifiable complaints of oppression by the daughter she loves and the slowly evolving perception that she, Emma, is also an oppressed woman. Emma's awakening and transformation are vividly depicted in a scene late in the story, when she dares to challenge her husband:<br />\\" 'But John,' I heard her say, 'Methodists oppose slavery on principle, don't they? Hetty told me that good Methodists have permitted her friends, the Grimkes to speak when Congreationalists forbade it.'<br />\\"My father's baritone became a bass. 'Most Methodists, Emma, Father said, resist slavery on principle. But there is not universal agreement. The most troubling issue is that the contraversy is threatening the church itself. There are rumors that the church will soon divide in two. One north, another south.'<br />\\"My mother ducked her head. Her coverlet was draped across her lap, and from where I sat, the tree branches on its surface looked like brown throbbing veins. When she finally responded, she kept her eyes cast down. 'What would be so terrible about that, John? If the principle is wrong, wouldn't justice be served by separation?<br />\\"My father looked disturbed. I recognized that look. It was the same look he gave me when I practiced preaching with him beside the river.<br />\\" 'After all we've done to build the church, Emma?' he said. 'After all our struggles to free it from the strictures of Calvinism?'<br />\\"Mother studied her quilt while Father continued.<br />\\" 'Methodists are about connection, Emma. Not separation.' His voice was a chord of anger and disbelief.<br />\\" 'But doesn't justice require separation from things that are wrong?' she asked firmly. 'And doesn't justice often provoke controversy?'<br />\\" 'Controversy,' he replied equally firmly, 'is not the province of women.' The timbre in his voice declared the conversation over.\\"<br />Another important aspect of UNCOMMON FAITH is the conflict over the true meaning (and relevance) of those Biblical passages used to facilitate the oppression of women and African-Americans. The community's Quakers have their own quotes to back up their opposition to slavery and support for equality between all.<br />Through the story's conflicts, Faith learns that knowledge is power and that the men seem to get all the credit--even when the women have done all of the work.

Era peque&ntilde;o y no muy fuerte, pero un trabajador incansable.  Casi cualquier cultivo era un tormento.  Arrancar betabeles le desgarraba la piel entre el dedo pulgar y el &iacute;ndice.  Los vi&ntilde;edos rociados con pesticidas le irritaban los ojos y le hac&iacute;an dif&iacute;cil la respirac&iacute;on.  La lechuga era lo peor de todo.  Plantar lechuga con un azad&oacute;n de mango corto le causaba espasmos de dolor por toda la espalda.  Trabajar la tierra de otros en vez de la propia, le parac&iacute;a ser una forma de eslavitud.<br />\\"La familia Ch&aacute;vez hablaba constantemente de ahorrar lo suficiente para poder volver a comprar su rancho.

You didn't understand that the first time because it was in Spanish?  Hey!  What's wrong with you?<br /><br />\\"The towns weren't much better than the fields.  WHITE TRADE ONLY signs were displayed in many stores and restaurants.  None of the thirty-five schools Cesar attended over the years seemed like a safe place, either.  Once, after Cesar broke the rule about speaking English at all times, a teacher hung a sign on him that read, I AM A CLOWN.  I SPEAK SPANISH.  He came to hate school because of the conflicts, though he liked to learn.  Even he considered his eighth-grade graduation a miracle.  After eighth grade he dropped out to work in the fields full-time.\\"<br /><br />When Cesar was young, his mother cautioned him and his siblings \\"against fighting, urging them to use their minds and mouths to work out conflicts.\\"<br /><br />And so, instead of punching out those people responsible for making his family's life so tough, Se&ntilde;ora Chavez's son grew up to be a disciple of Gandhi and of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Cesar organized migrant workers one by one, persuaded them to go on strike against grape growers, and led them on a march of over 300 miles to Sacramento, thus obtaining the first contract for farmworkers in American history.<br /><br />As Kathleen Krull reiterates in her author's note, \\"Before [Chavez] formed the National Farm Workers Association, [farm] workers had...the longest hours, lowest wages, harshest conditions, shortest life spans, and least power of any group of workers in America.\\"<br /><br />Krull also explains how Chavez would go on hunger strikes as a publicity tool for achieving economic justice for the migrant workers.  (This strategy had worked well for both Gandhi and, earlier, for the Suffragists.  Sadly, while also effective for Chavez, it eventually killed him.)<br /><br />HARVESTING HOPE: THE STORY OF CESAR CHAVEZ (the title of the English language version) is an essential biography for elementary and middle school libraries about one of America's greatest civil rights leaders.  It is written in the 32 page picture book format and illustrated with brilliant, Caldecott-quality acrylic paintings by Yuyi Morales who trekked through the fields and vineyards for inspiration.<br /><br />Before sharing this book--the English edition--with her eighth-grade English students last month, my wife Shari asked her students about Cesar Chavez.  Despite being raised in California where Cesar did all of his groundbreaking work, not one in a hundred of these students knew anything significant about Chavez.  A couple had heard of him--thanks to there being streets and plazas named in his honor.<br /><br />The book has unfortunately been mislabeled as being for ages 6-9.  In reading it to a class of 8-10 year olds, I found those students did not have the same firm grasp of the vocabularyand concepts (union organizing, contracts, walking 300 miles, owning 80 acres, etc.) that makes it a more ideal fit for middle schoolers.  (Yes, this review will serve as my nomination of the book for the California Young Reader Medal in the Picture Books for Older Readers category.)<br /><br />As with great books about other important and inspirational leaders who have devoted their lives to change for the better, HARVESTING HOPE: THE STORY OF CESAR CHAVEZ provides fertile ground for planting a seed of activism in the hearts of young readers.

It's a battle for me to stay in regular and not get stuck in remedial. I've always kept ahead of the game, but I still hate English. I hate books, I hate school in general. Always have. Any minute somebody could be expecting you to read out loud, or to explain something.\\"<br />Boy, do I feel stupid.<br />Don't tell anybody, but Richie--who has a reputation to maintain for having read nearly EVERYTHING when it comes to recently published YA literature--has never before read a book by A.M. Jenkins. Not even the previous one, which was designated a BBYA Top Ten. I couldn't even tell Shari if A.M. Jenkins was a man or a woman. (Shari was the one who looked on the copyright page and discovered that A.M. stands for Amanda McRaney.)<br />I can joke about it (even if I am truly embarrassed to admit this particular gap in my knowledge) because having grown up as an excellent reader and student I've always understood that knowledge gaps of all sorts are easily bridged by finding the right book--or sometimes, these days, the right website--and reading the necessary information.<br />That is, you can easily bridge knowledge gaps IF you have the skills to read and comprehend the language--if, like me, you learned to read well as a young child and then steadily improved your abilities through coaching and practice.<br />We never learn specifically why sixteen-year old, star baseball player Colt Trammel had such a hard time learning to read, but he did, and it is obvious that the school system has failed him by never providing the help he has desperately needed:<br />\\"I can't remember the first time I knew I was stupid. It must have been in kindergarten or first grade, when everybody else could already tell the letters apart and I couldn't, even though I started school a year late on account of my birthday's in June and my dad didn't want me to be the smallest boy in my class for the rest of my life. But even with a year's head start, I kept getting the letters mixed up. I still don't read so good.<br />\\"But I am good at copying, lying, cheating. I get notes like 'doesn't work up to potential,' and 'would rather entertain his classmates than work.'<br />\\"And that's why I could always sit through a whole class period, doing nothing but watching Grace. I'd give anything to be smart like that. The only smart I am is smart-mouthed. And if somebody like Grace--intellectual, pure, refined--could fall for me, then nobody will ever guess that I'm just plain f---g stupid, after all.\\"<br />This feeling of stupidity colors Colt's entire world and his interactions with everyone in it, be it a girl, a teacher, the coach, or his fellow ballplayers. It results in his intolerance of people who are different so that he can feel better about himself.<br />In one of the year's great coming-of-age stories, Colt Trammel teeters on the edge of complete disaster: Grace is ambivalent about their relationship. Colt is reaching the critical point at which accumulated years of not understanding the subject matter in his classes is steadily sinking his chances of even cheating his way to the passing grades necessary to remain on the baseball team when spring arrives.

Ice formed on the curtains and crusted thickly around the lights in the ceiling. The glowing filaments in each bulb shrank and dimmed, while the candles that sprang from every available surface like a colony of toadstools had their wicks snuffed out. The darkened room filled with a yellow, choking cloud of brimstone, in which indistinct black shadows writhed and roiled. From far away came the sound of many voices screaming. Pressure was suddenly applied to the door that led to the landing. It bulged inward, the timbers groaning. Footsteps from invisible feet came pattering across the floorboards and invisible mouths whispered wicked things from behind the bed and under the desk.<br />\\"The sulfur cloud contracted into a thick column of smoke that vomited forth thin tendrils; they licked the air like tongues before withdrawing. The column hung above the middle of the pentacle, bubbling ever upward against the ceiling like the cloud of an erupting volcano. There was a barely perceptible pause. Then two yellow staring eyes materialized in the heart of the smoke.<br />\\"Hey, it was his first time. I wanted to scare him.\\"<br />Meet Bartimaeus, a powerful djinni who is capable of adopting thousands of visible guises, observing things on seven different planes, and who enjoys dropping the names of (and telling anecdotes about) the famous people he has served over the course of many millennia. He is the title character of a new trilogy being written by British author Jonathan Stroud.<br />Bartimaeus has been summoned by Nathaniel, a somewhat slight twelve-year-old who was sold at a tender age into a magician's apprenticeship. Nathaniel has been raised by that clueless and mediocre magician, Arthur Underwood, who serves in the British government's Ministry of Internal Affairs, and by Underwood's wife, who is loving and maternal toward the apprentice, while seemingly quite blind to her husband's shortcomings--particularly his harsh manner of relationship with the boy.<br />Having been summoned by Nathaniel, Bartimaeus waits for his orders:<br />\\"The kid cleared his throat. This was the moment. This was what he'd been building up to. He'd been dreaming of this for years, when he should have been lying on his bed thinking about racing cars or girls. I waited grimly for the request. What would it be? Levitating some object was a usual one, or moving it from one side of the room to the other. Perhaps he'd want me to conjure an illusion. That might be fun: there was bound to be a way of misinterpreting his request and upsetting him.<br />\\" 'I charge you to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand from the house of Simon Lovelace and bring it to me when I summon you at dawn tomorrow.'<br />\\" 'You what?'<br />\\" 'I charge you to retrieve--'<br />\\" 'Yes, I heard what you said.' I didn't mean to sound petulant. It just slipped out, and my sepulchral tones slipped a bit too.\\"<br />At first underestimating the boy--as so many characters do throughout the book--Bartimaeus assumes Nathaniel is being manipulated by some \\"real\\" magician to snatch the powerful charm. But unknown to all, Nathaniel is a brilliant apprentice with a razor sharp memory who has self-taught himself by devouring book after book in his master's library. Underwood's continuing attitude--that Nathaniel is worthless and untrainable--fuels the boy's quiet and tenacious determination to develop himself into an exceptional magician and eventually fulfill his aspirations of growing up to serve in Parliament.<br />Bartimaeus has been summoned by the boy because Nathaniel is also determined to take revenge for the humiliating fashion in which he has been treated in the past by a group of Underwood's cohorts, led by the power-hungry Lovelace. It turns out that Simon Lovelace has acquired the Amulet in question through a deadly scheme. When Bartimaeus obeys his young master command and succeeds in gaining the Amulet, Lovelace is willing to do anything necessary to insure the charm's return.<br />The unusual relationship that develops between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel winds its way through the 460 pages of this wild, action-filled tale. That relationship is both adversarial and interdependent, and involves gradually increasing levels of mutual respect.<br />And, as you might have inferred, Bartimaeus has quite a wit. The author utilizes frequent footnotes to allow the djinni to provide explanations and historic tidbits, as well as share his many sarcastic asides (&agrave; la Groucho Marx).<br />Jonathan Stroud, who, like his character, lives amid the outskirts of London, is currently balancing obligations to promote this first book with the need to keep an eye on his approaching January deadline for submitting the second manuscript. Miramax has spent a substantial sum for the movie rights to the trilogy, and after devouring the first book, it sure seems like a great investment.<br />\\"The first grudging rays flickered in the eastern sky. A halo of light slowly emerged over the Docklands horizon. I cheered it on. It couldn't come fast enough.<br />\\"The whole night had been a wearisome and often humiliating business. I had repeatedly lurked, loitered, and fled, in that order, through half the postal districts of London. I had been manhandled by a thirteen-year-old girl. I had taken shelter in a bin. And now, to cap it all, I was crouching on the roof of Westminister Abbey, pretending to be a gargoyle. Things don't get much worse than that.\\"<br />I carried this book around the show with me all weekend, taking full advantage of any and all free moments to read another chapter of our heroes matching wits, wills, imps, and illusions against the bad guys. Oftentimes, traipsing through Stroud's complicated world, I was in total awe: It was like watching someone use a truckload of paper clips to build a life-size model of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and you're just waiting for it to fall apart--but it all just keeps holding together...like magic.<br />Richie Partingtono insure the charm's return. <br />The unusual relationship that develops between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel winds its way through the 460 pages of this wild, action-filled tale.

The nation's capital held two marbles tournaments--one for the city's white youngsters and the other for its colored children. But Washington could send only one champion to the national marbles tournament. Instead of holding a playoff between the two winners, the city automatically selected the white champion to represent Washington in the national tournament. The colored champion was automatically named runner-up for the city. This was done to keep black and white children from playing marbles together--and to prevent the possibility of a black child winning the city and national titles.<br />\\"Washington, D.C., had a dog cemetery. But in the 1940s only animals belonging to white people could be buried there. Dogs whose owners were black were excluded. When asked about it, the owner of the pet cemetery joked that although the dogs wouldn't care, be believed the white customers would.<br />\\" 'Washington--Disgrace to the Nation,' an article by Howard Whitman in the February 1950 Woman's Home Companion, described black people being turned away from downtown restaurants and theaters. In one case, a group of black people, including some soldiers, tried to see a film called Home of the Brave DANGER DRAWS NO COLOR LINE! proclaimed posters outside the theater. But the theater manager phoned the police, who made sure that no black people got into the movie. Home of the Brave is a classic movie about a black soldier suffering from discrimination.\\"<br />Most people perceive the modern Civil Rights Movement as having arisen in the mid-1950s. The Supreme Court's landmark decision on segregated schools--Brown v. Board of Education, Rosa Parks being arrested after refusing to move to the back of the bus, and the horrific photos of Emmitt Till's mutilated corpse being published in Jet were unquestionably pivotal historic events that awakened the empathy and/or righteous anger in millions of Americans of good conscience.<br />But for half a century prior to those key events, Mary Church Terrell--a woman of color whose birth to slave parents took place while the ink on the Emancipation Proclamation was still drying--was walking into white establishments where she was not wanted, was cajoling Presidents to do the right thing, was involved in the founding of early Black Rights organizations, and was inspiring those future leaders of the Civil Rights Movement who are so well known to those of us who grew up in the 1960s.<br />I am embarrassed to admit that I knew nothing of Mary Church Terrell before reading this book. But this well-written and well illustrated biography has brought me up to speed.<br />\\" He yanked her roughly out of her seat and asked a man sitting nearby, 'Whose little ... is this?' \\"<br />After growing up with an unusually rich education, including a college degree from Oberlin, Mary Church Terrell spent decades working for equality alongside such major historic figures as Susan B. Anthony, Jane Addams, Fredrick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells, and W.E.B. Du Bois. She was a cofounder of the NAACP. But the work she did in her mid-80s was arguably the most important of all. After organizing campaigns in which she and other people of color attempted to eat in segregated D.C. establishments, she became part of a legal proceeding to compel the enforcement of D.C.'s long-ignored anti-discrimination laws. That fight eventually reached the Supreme Court.<br />\\"On June 8, 1953, William O. Douglas rose and presented the high court's ruling. 'The failure to enforce a law does not result in its repeal,' he said, expressing the Supreme Court's opinion.\\"<br />What was the reaction of the ninety year old self-proclaimed meddler? She returned to the public cafeteria that had refused her business and had the bowl of soup she'd been waiting three years to enjoy. Then she gathered up some African American friends and headed to a segregated movie theater. Having been born at the end of slave days, prior to the enactment of the Jim Crow laws, Mary lived just long enough to savor the Brown v.

Or perhaps I should say that after reading BLANKETS I understand that the reason I have been a reader unmoved by graphic novels is that they have consistently failed to touch me in the manner that Craig Thompson's 600-page illustrated novel has--page after page after page.<br /><br />\\"Sheep: A blanket begins in a faraway place<br />Where skies are blue and there's lots of space<br />The nights are cold and we sleep outside<br />To keep warm and toasty we grow hair on our hide<br />But when spring comes round the weather is warm<br />A thick woolly coat loses all of its charm<br />We're itchy and hot 'till the rancher arrives<br />To give us each a haircut and brighten up our lives<br />He grabs a big bag and he gathers the wool<br />And he stuffs and he crams 'till the bags are full<br />He throws 'em on the truck 'till it's piled up high<br />Then he climbs into the driver's seat and says 'Goodbye'<br />That's the story of Bert's blanket<br />That's the story of Bert's blanket<br />That's the story of Bert's blanket\\" --Sesame Street<br /><br />Perhaps the size of BLANKETS is one of its big pluses.  I wouldn't call the typical comic book a novel; nor do I believe that a comic book becomes worthy of the term \\"novel\\" simply because it contains mature themes, explicit images and a hardcover binding.  While my wife, the English teacher, would describe what I'm saying in terms of significant character development, plot, theme, and all that literature jargon, I would simply say that a successful \\"real\\" novel gives me something to really bite into and leaves me with plenty to think about after I'm done turning the pages.  With its captivating blend of text and illustrations, BLANKETS is a novel does that to perfection.<br />BLANKETS is the semiautobiographical tale of a boy growing up.  The story--which covers (blankets?) nearly two decades--includes Craig's brother, parents, school, art, sexuality, religion and religious leaders, Church Camp, First Love, and that Love's extended family.  It also contains several blankets (as in the kind you sleep beneath) as well as blankets of snow and some metaphorical blankets.<br /><br />The action in the story is nicely counterbalanced with the main character's introspection about his self-evolution, interactions, relationships, and religious beliefs.<br /><br /> \\"Linus: Where's my blanket?\\"<br /><br />But, most significantly, what Craig Thompson does to perfection in BLANKETS is to utilize this illustrated format in order to be able to reveal far more with his combination of words and images than he could possibly have done with words alone.  Whether it is the drawings telling part of the story as when, for example, we view the series of illustrations in which Craig's hand nervously, anxiously, plays with the curled telephone cord as he tries to \\"reconnect\\" with Raina, or whether it is the capability to often have Craig simultaneously saying one thing while thinking another, or the opportunity for the author to transition to extensive dialogue without having to constantly resort to \\"He said.\\" or \\"She said,\\" or even the potential of showing Craig's and his brother's drawings rather than having to describe them, I can now really see and understand the potential of writing a novel in this format.  I could easily go on and on about other highlights: the power of being able to see those looks passing between Craig and Raina, the joy of being able to watch the bedtime hijinx between the young Craig and his brother, or being able to read an entire story on the face of Raina's father when his discovery leads to contemplation of what has happened in his own life.<br /><br />BLANKETS is a book that leaves me with warm, cozy memories; one you absolutelyneed to see (and crawl inside of) yourself.<br /><br />Richieurself. <BR> <BR>Richie	2003-11-05

Which is laughable. Half the names of places in Rhode Island are Native American. There are statues of Indians in the parks and plaques that tell where this treaty was signed or that attack happened. Everyone has heard of the Indians, they just don't think about them that much. Indians are ancient history here, like three hundred years ago or more.\\"<br />\\"One little, two little, three little Indians<br />Four little, five little, six little Indians<br />Seven little, eight little, nine little Indians<br />Ten little Indian boys.\\"<br />I was a little kid on Long Island back in an era when in circle time songs you'd as easily count ten little Indians as you would count six little ducks or ten green and speckled frogs.<br />A few years further on, in the mid 1960s, I chose \\"The Indian Tribes of Paumanok\\" (a Native American name for Long Island) as the topic for a social studies report. And while this raised my 10 year-old state of consciousness a few notches, I still had a heck of a time envisioning the booming suburbs where I lived as having been a vast woodland sheltering those peoples.<br />In contrast, thirteen year old Joelle, the main character in THE CRYING ROCKS, has such an ability and inclination. In fact, she can sometimes imagine someone from the distant past following her. Joelle, who was adopted at five by \\"Aunt\\" Mary Louise and \\"Uncle\\" Vernon, has that hunger to know about her own roots. In sharp contrast to her \\"heavy and earthbound\\" adoptive parents, Joelle is such a tall and striking seventh grader that a group of little neighborhood girls worships her from a distance, imagines her to be royalty, and emulates her style. But it is clear to the reader that something awful must have happened to Joelle as a young child, since she cannot remember the mysterious and unspoken circumstances in which she came to be discovered at the railroad depot of the northwestern Rhode Island community where she has since lived.<br />\\" 'Back in the woods there's a place where they used to meet. A high council place. There are trails, too. You can tell they're old Indian paths because of how deep they're worn down. It would take hundreds of years of feet to wear down a path like that.'<br />\\" 'Hundreds of years of feet?' she says. 'Give me a break.'<br />\\" 'A thousand years, even. Some artifacts are that old and more. What's amazing is how their culture got wiped out when the white man came. Fifty years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, the Narragansetts were all gone, thirty or forty-thousand people who lived right around here.'<br />\\" 'What happened?' Joelle asked in spite of herself.<br />\\" Carlos stares at her. 'Disease, first, then they were killed off. The last few were sold into slavery down in the West Indies. It's one of those histories people don't like to remember.'<br />\\" 'But you do?'<br />\\" 'I'm part Indian.'<br />\\" 'Really?'<br />\\"Carlos stands up straighter and looks at her defiantly, as if she might have a problem with this. She registers again his gray eyes, his brown hair, his long thin face. \\" 'You don't look--'<br />\\" 'Just a small part,' Carlos says quickly. 'Like about one sixteenth or something.' \\"<br />The innocent and tentative relationship that develops between Carlos and Joelle--that of close friends whom the reader imagines/hopes will later become boyfriend and girlfriend--is impeccably drawn. Sometimes as if a pair of bumper cars, sometimes utterly in tune, the connection between these two kids who are finding themselves winds its way through the tension of the story to an absolutely fun and joyous scene where the two are dueling each other with quotes from their research.<br />THE CRYING ROCKS asks hard questions about the values and behavior of the Europeans who came to America as well as that of the Narragansetts who were there when the ships arrived. The author skillfullyties these questions to treatment of arguably \\"less fortunate\\" groups in twenty-first century society. Janet Taylor Lisle has an ability for crafting a story that is taut and powerful while maintaining the limits which allow for this story to be used in middle school classrooms. THE CRYING ROCKS will find a home in those classrooms and is a tale that will surely have readers thinking and asking about their own roots.ons to treatment of arguably \\"less fortunate\\" groups in twenty-first century society.

US	43320771	R3H1DHWFL2N3LG	0823415856	97924781	In Defense of Liberty: The Story of America's Bill of Rights (Orbis Pictus Honor for Outstanding Nonfiction for Children (Awards))	Books	5	9	12	N	Y	Richie's Picks: IN DEFENSE OF LIBERTY	On April 23, 2003, William Baue reported in SocialFunds.com:<br />IN DEFENSE OF LIBERTY: THE STORY OF AMERICA'S BILL OF RIGHTS is first a brief history of the formulation of the US Bill of Rights. It is also a look at how the black-robed trustees of the \\"462 words written two centuries ago\\" which \\"promise the basic civil liberties that all Americans enjoy as their birthright\\" have not always kept that promise for all Americans, and it examines how these words are interpreted and reinterpreted as the group of individuals serving on the Supreme Court change, as society, technology, and other factors change, and as new circumstances and new laws come into play.<br />Interpretation of new laws in relationship to the Constitution is called judicial review. When it comes to the Bill of Rights, judicial review constantly reveals those 462 words to be a living, enduring organism that is relevant today, no matter what day today is. It causes many of us to be forever amazed by the genius of the Founding Fathers in gathering these words/ideas/ideals (particularly when they and their progeny were such jerks in keeping those sacred rights to themselves and their white male moneyed Protestant slave-owning counterparts for so damned long).<br />For such a book to have some lasting value to a reader and to a library collection, it must illuminate the beginnings and flow of Constitutional history in such a way that readers can understand the process and utilize that understanding as a stepping stone for future exploration as the Bill of Rights continues evolving through new justices and new Court cases.<br />Russell Freedman's book does just that. It shows how times change and decisions change. It provides juicy, sometimes gross examples of behavior that resulted in the promulgation of the English Common Law, the English Bill of Rights and how those rights and American colonial-period behaviors all contributed to these first ten Amendments to the US Constitution.<br />Freedman presents many historic decisions--later \\"corrected\\" by more-recent Justices--that (hopefully) all of us would agree in retrospect were unfair. Some early examples are a result of a Supreme Court ruling in the early 1800s that the Bill of Rights applied only to the national government. Thus (besides the slaves, the Native Americans, and the boorish treatment of women) you had other situations I wasn't aware of such as:<br />\\"In New Jersey, non-Protestants weren't granted full civil rights until 1844. In New Hampshire, Catholics couldn't vote until 1851.\\"<br />But the vast proportion of the information and cases that Russell Freedman presents involve issues that are relevant and vital to today's teens. Discussion of Japanese Internment is followed by a look at the treatment and roundups of Muslim and Arab men in America following September 11th. Freedman explores many other hot-button issues such as reproductive freedom, high-tech snooping, random drug testing, the Internet, and the Death Penalty. I found his presentation of the modern issues and historic precedents surrounding the Second Amendment to be especially thought-provoking. (I'd love to see classroom discussion of that chapter coupled with a viewing of Bowling for Columbine.)<br />Accompanying both the historic and current issues are great tie-in photos and other illustrations. For instance, back in February we discussed with our students Bretton Barber, the Michigan kid who was kicked out of school for wearing a shirt with a printed photo of the President captioned \\"International Terrorist.\\" Barber--who along with the ACLU has a lawsuit pending against the school district--invoked the Tinker v. Des Moines case from the 1960s in asserting his right to wear that shirt. Not only does this book include discussion of the Tinker case, it has a great photo of the two Tinker kids holding their black armbands emblazoned with peace symbols. (In ruling for the Tinker siblings, the Court decreed that constitutional protections \\"are not shed at the school house gate.\\")<br />The more sophisticated history students will consume this book quickly and be hungry for more. They will be able to dig into the extensive bibliographical sources that Freedman provides us, the majority of which have been published within the last decade. But the typical eighth-grade American History student will find this book in itself a wealth of information and a doorway to the beauty and enduring nature of our country's most precious of documents.<br />Richie Partington<br />....protections \\"are not shed at the school house gate.\\") <br />The more sophisticated history students will consume this book quickly and be hungry for more.

When a man continually accuses a woman of flirting or having an affair, and is suspicious of everyone he sees with her, he is possessive and controlling...Adolescent girls, in particular, feel social pressure to stick it out because having a 'bad' boyfriend is better than having no boyfriend at all.\\"<br />Such facts and statistics certainly point out the need for good YA literature dealing with adolescent dating abuse. There have been a couple of great stories published in recent years, and Janet Tashjian's FAULTLINE, which hits the shelves in time for Back To School Night, joins that list of must-reads.<br />Becky Martin is a high achieving high school senior from San Francisco who is also an aspiring standup comic. She's got intelligent, supportive parents. Her best girlfriend, Abby, is also a comedic hopeful and a fan of old movies. But while Abby has a steady stream of boyfriends who come and go, Becky has spent high school high and dry:<br />\\"Friends and family have always described me as two things: smart and funny. Never pretty, never interesting, just smart and funny. I wasn't complaining--those were necessary qualities for my chosen line of work, but it would be nice to at least register on the attractiveness scale once in a while.<br />\\"Unlike Abby, I hadn't had a boyfriend since Peter last year, and even that was stretching the definition of boyfriend way past anything Webster would have recognized. I had better luck holding the attention of a roomful of people in a comedy club than a guy--I couldn't decide if that was good or just plain pathetic. Idea for a routine--in my neighborhood growing up, I was everybody else's invisible friend.\\"<br />Enter Kip Costello, a fellow aspiring comic with talent, creativity, and looks. He sweeps Becky off her feet with his attention and his thoughtfulness. Things move quickly. Becky has school work, two part-time jobs, college applications, and her comedy career, but they all seem (at least to her parents and Abby) to be taking a back-seat to Kip.<br />According to Becky, nobody understands how special her relationship with Kip is.<br />But what Becky doesn't understand is that Kip is as lacking in self-confidence as she is. In a series of brief notes that Kip writes to himself (and that we get to read), Kip constantly worries about the relationship. His micromanagement of Becky's life and the inherent frustration he feels when everything doesn't go perfectly results in his abusing her. But Becky is in too deep to listen to anybody--including herself.<br />\\"A relationship is a lot like a hot bath. The more you get used to it, the more you realize it's not so hot...\\"<br />FAULTLINE is a great title for this important book because (1) it's set in San Francisco, and (2) there is no bad guy, no one at fault, unless it is that system that compels adolescents \\"to stick it out because having a 'bad' boyfriend is better than having no boyfriend at all.\\" I'm sure they briefly consideredPUNCHLINE, but discarded it as too insensitive a pun for too serious a situation.<br />But that serious situation does not mean that FAULTLINE is one long downer of a book. The camaraderie between Becky and Abby is genuine. We like these two intelligent and comedic girls and can see why they like each other. Becky's part-time gig as a tour guide to the City's movie landmarks is also fun and really informative. And then there is Delilah, about whom I'll say no more then that she gives the book a San Francisco homeyness that us Northern California crazies will thoroughly appreciate and enjoy.<br />Many people have wondered how Janet Tashjian would follow up the wildly successful THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LARRY. While FAULTLINE is a very different novel, Tashjian is again able to look closely at a serious problem in our society while telling a story filled with smart humor that teens will devour.sidered PUNCHLINE, but discarded it as too insensitive a pun for too serious a situation. <br />But that serious situation does not mean that FAULTLINE is one long downer of a book.

But as we soon discover by diving into this gripping combination of history and science, such maternal \\"love\\" is not forthcoming when it comes to Carcharodon carcharias, the great white shark:<br />\\"The shark shared the womb with eight to ten other pups, and during gestation, the shark's brain triggered a simple equation: life = food = life. The life was very close, and the shark attacked--devouring the other pups. So the shark began life as a kind of in utero cannibal. Twelve to fourteen months after conception, it emerged having won the most elemental of sibling rivalries--the privilege to be born.<br />\\"The shark came out of the womb four to five feet long, fifty to eighty-five pounds, hunting. The shark had no air bladder for buoyancy, like most fish, so it had to keep moving, moving and killing and eating, or it would sink to the depths and die. There was no playful puppyhood, no more nurturing from parents. The newborn shark fled its mother. Her instinct was to eat the nearest food source. Nature pumped her full of hormones that diminished her appetite temporarily. Mother's parting gift to her pup was to give it a brief window of escape before she devoured it.\\"<br />Of course, this was not the kind of information understood in 1916 when the experts were at first stubbornly dismissing the possibility that the cause of swimmers being chewed up along the Jersey shore could be shark-related. Mass numbers of Americans swimming in the ocean was a relatively new diversion in those days.<br />In this adaptation of his previously-published adult book, Michael Capuzzo intertwines today's knowledge of sharks with the historic accounts of that carnage nearly a century ago in order to drag us kicking and screaming through both the life of a shark and through those horrific summer days of 1916 when one of those sharks--for some unknown reason--began to feast on my grandparents' generation in their funny-looking, old-fashioned bathing costumes.<br />In fact, my grandfather, Rex--the guy who would spend hour after hour in the saltwater with me when I was little--grew up in New Jersey and was fourteen, staying at his family's Ocean Grove summer home, when the book's events took place. He was reportedly a little more cautious after the attacks--one of which took the life of teenager Charles Bruder, an oceanside resort's bell captain, just a few miles south of where Rex was swimming that particular day. (To think I might not be here today if that shark's hunger aimed it a little more northward!)<br />\\"...The shark was adapted to handle the crisis of hunger in ways human beings did not know in 1916, and struggled decades later to understand. As the shark swam, there is evidence the legs and bones of Charles Bruder cut off at the knees and pieces of the bell captain's torso remained preserved in the fish's stomach for later consumption, in the manner of a camel. Gleaming specimens of dolphins and mackerel, fresh as if iced in the fishmonger's window, have been pulled from the stomachs of sharks, as well as still-legible paper documents. But the most compelling proof of the shark's camel-like ability in crisis occurred on April 17, 1935, when Albert Hobston caught a thirteen-foot tiger shark off a Sydney, Australia, beach and towed it alive to the Coogee Aquarium. Eight days later, dying in captivity, the shark regurgitated a bird, a rat, and, eerily visible in a cloud of muck, a human arm--a thick, muscular arm, so well preserved that the forearm was clearly marked with a tattoo of two boxers. On the basis of a photograph of the tattoo, published in a Sydney newspaper, a man identified his brother, James Smith. The arm was preserved so well, it was accepted as evidence that led to the arrest of a man for murdering and dismembering Smith and dumping him at sea.\\"<br />CLOSE TO SHORE is extensively illustrated with maps and newspaper copy from 1916, as wellas photographs of the era's resorts, beach attire, and several of the human characters who were involved in this real-life drama.<br />That drama ends with the accidental netting of a shark, who is then beaten to death in hand-to-tooth combat by the two men in the little rowboat behind which the net was being dragged. While today's DNA testing would more conclusively link the body parts found in the shark's stomach to the New Jersey coastal victims, the evidence seems substantial enough to believe it to be the rogue killer who fortunately spared my grandfather, allowing me to exist and to grow up swimming off the Long Island beaches.<br />That I never encountered anything more than little sand sharks has undoubtedly much to do with the zeal of unenlightened generations to eliminate that jagged-toothed link in the marine biological chain as a result of such terrifying events as the shark attacks of 1916. CLOSE TO SHORE is a thriller that will introduce readers to this mysterious creatures of the deep and perhaps spawn a few marine biologists in the process.<br />Richie Partington<br />...well as photographs of the era's resorts, beach attire, and several of the human characters who were involved in this real-life drama. <br />That drama ends with the accidental netting of a shark, who is then beaten to death in hand-to-tooth combat by the two men in the little rowboat behind which the net was being dragged.

People were not invited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.\\"<br />--F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925<br />\\"Everybody was there--most of the football team, their girlfriends, the cheerleaders, and a bunch of their boyfriends and friends, the cooler people from student council, and a collection of athletes from basketball and track. I noticed some sophomore girls whose names I didn't know--they'd really filled out over the summer; and a few guys who played in their own rock band. It was the guest list that really made this bash what it was. If I could put together the party of my dreams--not that my parents ever left me alone in the house for more than five minutes--this was exactly the kind of crowd I'd want. I marveled at how a newcomer like Jake Garrett could waltz into town and instantly know all the right people to invite.<br />\\"I turned to Todd. 'Do you see him?'<br />\\"Todd shook his head. 'Must be upstairs.'<br />\\" 'Don't his parents notice there are fifty kids going nuts in their house?' I asked.<br />\\"Jake's dad's out of town five days a week,' Todd explained. 'His mother lives in Texas somewhere. He picked up a slice of pizza from the table that was loaded with the stuff, folded it expertly, and took a bite.\\"<br />--Gordon Korman, 2003<br />In the same way that Will Shakespeare's immortal work has long benefited from West Side Story, Francis Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece, THE GREAT GATSBY, will undoubtedly profit from the publication of JAKE, REINVENTED, an extremely well-crafted contemporary retelling by Gordon Korman. Korman, a master of smart-mouthed characters whose own twist on the Bard's star-crossed lovers--last year's SON OF THE MOB--was one of 2002's funniest YA books, has taken a slightly more serious turn with his latest story.<br />\\"Jake gave a nervous laugh, 'I guess you've figured out my little side job.' \\"<br />Frankly, it takes a little imagination to visualize swarms of teens of my grandfather's generation (no less this generation) taking GATSBY to heart as a cautionary tale. But transformed into a contemporary YA, it is quite easy to see how Rick's (think Nick's) narration of this story of obsession, acceptance, and popularity will have many teens thinking hard about the consequences of these characters' actions. It is said that teenagers reinvent themselves on a daily basis. This believable tale of metamorphosis will surely serve them well.<br />\\"I began to push my way through the clammy bodies.<br />\\"Marty Rapaport grabbed me and held back my progress. 'Hey, cross-bite, what's going on? What is this, the O.K. Corral?'<br />\\"I heard Jake's greeting to Todd. 'Glad you could make it, baby. What's up?'<br />\\"For a second there, I toyed with the possibility that he could brazen it through, that his sheer faith in who he'd become might do the job for him. This wasn't the old Jacob Garrett. This was Jake, reinvented. But as soon as Todd started talking, I knew the battle was lost.\\"<br />In Korman's version, you still have the Gatsby figure creating everything for that girl from his past. You have the corresponding infidelities at the center of things. And while the ultimate outcome is toned down from car crashes and gunshots to cracked skulls and exiles, it feels no less tragic. Think about West Side Story. If anything, Maria's being left alive and alone at the end of the story, with her rage at the prejudice that caused Tony's death, is MORE powerful than Juliette's self-absorbed suicide.<br />\\"They began to close the distance between them, moving in that trancelike state that is so dramatic and all phony. It would have been a real romantic moment except for the three guys standing on their heads against the wall trying to chug upside down while a cheering section bellowed encouragement. I think they were betting on the outcome.\\"<br />Hey, this is Gordon Korman after all. I didn't claim there was NO humor in the book!<br />Just as viewers of West Side Story or readers of SON OF THE MOB lose little of the entertainment value by not being familiar with the inspiration for those stories, readers of JAKE may lose many interesting contrasts, but don't lose the relevance of the story by never having heard of GATSBY. (Having myself read GATSBY during my first semester comp class, I can just hear some college freshman in a few years, complaining that GATSBY is a rip-off of that Korman story about the kid who made all that money in order to win the beautiful girl.) Sophisticated readers will move from JAKE to the original and benefit from getting the whole enchilada. (Less ambitious readers will at least rent the video, like I did last night, and still get a taste.)<br />\\" 'You were right the first time,' I told her.

'What good does it do you? It seems to me, from what you've been telling us, that everyone these days knows everything about everyone and the split second it happens, too. What do they do with all this information? What does it get them? It just clutters up their peaceful quiet time. It seems to me from what you've been describing, nobody has peaceful quiet time anymore. Television, bah! Radio, bah! Newspapers, magazines, bah, bah! Sounds like the world is running off half-cocked, people getting zapped with their little hits of information. Needing it every day. Zap, zap, zap. Well, deliver me. Contagious. Like hoof-and-mouth disease. I hope you're not contaminated. Don't go trekking it all over our property.'<br />\\" 'Very funny,' said Mr. Feebles. 'You're a queer couple of ladies, is what you are.'<br />\\" 'Yes, yes,' said Tilly, 'those queer Menuto women. I know all about it. Now, you drive gently on those rutted roads and don't go breaking those blueberry jars.' \\"<br />Changes just keep creeping up on us.<br />\\"And Penpen's eyes welled up as she realized that Tilly was no longer a young girl, as if seeing her white kinked hair and wrinkles and suddenly realizing what they meant. That old age had come and what had seemed like an interesting diversion--the first few gray hairs, the stooping body--wasn't just a pleasant novelty. They weren't going back; they weren't ever going back. Their youth, their youth, was gone. It was as if, unwitnessed, out here, safe in the woods, they should have been out of time as well. If no one had seen their passing, they shouldn't have passed. She wondered if Tilly, lying upstairs alone, was suddenly as aware of it as she was.\\"<br />THE CANNING SEASON is a complex dichotomy of age and youth, of selfish and nurturing adults, of world-shrinking technology and isolation, and of two teenage girls, Rachet and Harper, who are fortunate enough to land on the doorstep of \\"those queer Menuto women.\\" What is so fascinating is seeing how Penpen and Tilly--twin nonagenarians--share a renaissance, despite their failing health, while the two teenage girls come of age in the unusual household, the old mansion on an isolated coast in Maine where Tilly and Penpen have spent their entire lives. Aside from the story's motherhood theme, the book is nonjudgmental in its approach to human existence and different lifestyles.<br />\\"Penpen said that living things were all critical mass, the definition of critical mass being the amount of fissionable material required to sustain a chain reaction. She tossed some weeds on the compost and said that people didn't like to see things rotting in the garden but there had to be all things to be growth. She told Rachet this over and over, and the things that someone repeats to you over and over you tend to remember.\\"<br />Rachet, the first adolescent character we meet in the story, is a rather passive girl who has been long neglected by the mother who ships her off to Maine for the summer. She needs to grow. One of Rachet's catalysts for growth is the blunt, computer-saavy Harper, who also shows up at the end of that rutted, bear-plagued road. Harper, who has been rejected--first by her mother and then by a mother-figure--is a real piece of work:<br />\\" 'I can't eat these raspberries, they're moldy,' Harper said loudly, picking them off and putting them on the tablecloth.<br />\\" 'Please use a saucer,' said Penpen. 'You'll stain dear Mother's tablecloth.'<br />\\" 'I thought dear Mother stained her own tablecloth,' said Harper sourly, because Tilly had told her part of the story.<br />\\" 'Not this one,' said Penpen.<br />\\"Rachet breathed a sigh of relief and began to pick off her own moldy ones. She had been worrying quite a bit that they might make her sick. She didn't think they wouldkill her unless she was allergic to penicillin, which as far as she knew she was not, but she didn't like the idea of them whizzing around her system, and although in the end she had suffered no ill effects, she was glad she no longer had to shovel them down. This was the good thing about Harper. She did things which at first seemed unbelievably rude and obnoxious but which you secretly wished you could do yourself. Her remarks were less offensive once they realized that she was simply determined to speak the truth and be done with it. There didn't seem to be any hidden corners in Harper's soul, and she wasn't interested in allowing other people theirs. Often, as in the case of the raspberries, this alleviated delicate problems.\\"<br />It is wonderful how the elderly characters act in a manner that young adults can totally relate to: Penpen trying on Zen philosophy and having a schoolgirl crush on Dr. Richardson; Tilly's self-absorption that often leaves everyone waiting all day for a meal. As a forty-eight year-old who identifies with being part of the younger generation, I can similarly identify with that shock of Penpen's in discovering that old age has arrived.<br />THE CANNING SEASON moves back and forth freely between Tilly and Penpen's younger years and the present. It hosts a series of hilarious, bizarre and horrific incidents and circumstances that keep readers (heads) rolling and wondering what will happen next. But for me, the multigenerational aspects to the story are what make this a uniquely exceptional tale with so much to ponder and discuss.unless she was allergic to penicillin, which as far as she knew she was not, but she didn't like the idea of them whizzing around her system, and although in the end she had suffered no ill effects, she was glad she no longer had to shovel them down.

Positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and markedly disorganized behavior. Negative symptoms include reduced emotional expression, social withdrawal, loss of pleasure, difficulty concentrating and/or thinking, and a lack of energy, spontaneity or initiative. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and preventing psychotic relapses.

The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain!\\"<br />--Eliza from My Fair Lady<br />Tolerance.org, a web-based division of the Southern Poverty Law Center, has created Mix It Up,... a network for youth activists who are challenging social boundaries in schools and communities. Last November they sponsored a national Mix It Up At Lunch day, which encouraged kids to consciously leave the confines of their own cliques and go sit instead with somebody they would ordinarily look right through. (There are some great stories on the Tolerance site from kids who are involved in this movement.)<br />SLUMMING is a tale in which three friends take paths that meander somewhere between Professor Henry Higgins' arrogant assumption that he can remake Eliza into his ideal woman and the Mix It Up philosophy that you need to throw off your assumptions, prejudices, and feelings of superiority in regards to those outside your own group.<br />\\"...you got to look outside your eyes<br />you got to think outside your brain<br />you got to walk outside your life<br />to where the neighborhood changes...<br />--Ani Difranco, Willing to Fight<br />Nikki:<br />\\" 'People always talk about how rude the French are,' my mother told me once. 'But that's because so many Americans think the world starts and stops with them. America isn't normal. It's just America. There are a lot of wonderful normals out there--hang on to yours too hard, and you'll miss a lot.'<br />\\"I think I'm beginning to understand what she meant.\\"<br />Sam:<br />\\" 'Why do you do this?' I ask her [Tia].<br />\\" 'What?' she says.<br />\\" 'Why do you make fun of everything about me?'<br />\\"She laughs again, one short, hollow-sounding laugh.<br />\\" 'Because you're a cartoon character,' she says. 'You're fake.'<br />\\" 'I'm fake,' I say.<br />\\" 'When you let me off at my house, and you drive down and turn the corner, you just--disappear. And then they bring you out tomorrow at school, with your little letter jacket and your clean shirt. I'm surprised you don't wear loafers or saddle shoes or something.' \\"<br />Alicia:<br />\\"But one day, one morning last fall...I looked up, and there he was. I could hardly see him through the press of his friends. Then the crowd shifted, and suddenly, there was his face. He was laughing, and then he looked right into my eyes.\\"<br />Nikki, Sam, and Alicia are high school seniors. They are long-time companions as a result of being the only three Morman kids their age in the school system:<br />Nikki:<br />\\"Without that, I doubt we would have gotten as close as we are--the three of us are so different. Sam is the football scholarship type--letter sweater and pins and all that. Alicia's the service club/student government type. And I'm the scholar and mess-off type. Three separate social classes. Sam is beautiful but focused; Alicia's got this fairy-like delicacy, both in mind and body; and I just run around, collecting people and talking a lot. We see the world in very different ways.\\"<br />Alicia:<br />\\"The idea came all at once: we will each choose a person who is obviously untapped, and we will try to open him up, set him free, give him life. I do not anticipate that it will be that hard--kindness, a little attention, support, friendship.\\"<br />SLUMMING shows us what takes place when these three young adults put their plan into gear. As happened with the characters in Kristen Randle's previous YA novel, BREAKING RANK, there are some intense reactions and unexpected consequences in SLUMMING when the three decide to mix it up with teens they've always seen around school but with whom they have never connected.<br />And when they boldly step outside their lives and stick their faces into somebody else's, there is the question of what happens next:<br />\\" 'So, is this a temporary thing? You score a friend, and then you go back to the way things were'--she opens her hands--'mission accomplished?'<br />\\"I don't know,' I admit. 'I didn't think it through that far.' ...'t think it through that far.' ...	2003-07-22

For most of that time I've resided in a small community across the country from where I was, myself, born and raised. I was enticed to move to Sebastopol, California--sight unseen--by Steven Schack, a late friend who was important in the goat dairying industry and who had adopted the community as his own while attending college nearby. I was motivated to seek out my little hillside spot in the country by the necessity of having a decent field in which to pasture my goats. \\"The farm\\" is now, in fact, the place where I have spent the largest chunk of my life.<br />Just as Steven convinced me to come, he also persuaded a number of well-known people in the goat industry to move here too. Shari and I even get to teach some of their children.<br />Thus, even though I only keep a modest herd these days, and even though my days of traveling eight or ten hours each way (through the night) to goat shows are many years behind me, I owe so much of whom I've become to having fallen in love back in the late 1970s with a little speckled goat kid, that I named Joyce (after a local politician). I have thousands of memories involving goats and friends with goats. Births and deaths. Backbreaking work rebuilding barns and erecting fences. The smelly, tedious work of shoveling out barns. The hot, sweaty job of shearing them for the show ring. Being handed a blue ribbon at a National Show. Lounging around outside with the does as they nudge me to be scratched, or tug at my hair to elicit my reaction. Watching the young kids hopping around in the tall grass like popcorn. Raising our children on the milk my goats produce.<br />Over my many years of involvement with children's picture books, I have always been delighted by the Nubian dairy goats that appear in many of Patricia Polacco's books. It has always been clear to me that Patricia has spent much time with the goats. Her goats' expressions are consistently reminiscent of ones I see in my own barn. When Patricia captures a goat they usually have ears that flop wildly and hooves that kick up ever so true to life.<br />G IS FOR GOAT is Patricia's celebration of goatkeeping. It will be a dangerous book in the hands of any persuasive youngster whose parents have enough room in the backyard for a family pet or a 4H project. Remember that Judith Viorst poem about Mother not wanting a dog? Well, there are going to be a bunch of mommies and daddies who are going to end up with a couple of Nubian does--like it or not--thanks to the joyfulness and appeal of this bouncy alphabet-of-goats book. Eating flowers, pulling carts, giving birth, climbing on things. Such is the life of goats.<br />An adorable introduction to one of the best friends you may ever have, my copy of G IS FOR GOATS is leaving here today with the pair of Nubian kids who I've just sold to a young couple and their preschool daughter.<br />And if you're ever around Sebastopol, you can stop by and chew a little cud with Beezus (one of the \\"old ladies\\"), Hollis Woods (this year's rambunctious firstborn), and the rest of our \\"girls.\\" ...iscent of ones I see in my own barn.

I'm seventeen years old, weigh 296 pounds, and I'm six foot one. I have a crew cut, yes a crew cut, sallow skin, and the kind of mouth that puckers when I breathe. I'm wearing a shirt that reads MIAMI BEACH--SPRING BREAK 1997, and huge, bland tan pants--the only kind of pants I own. Eight pairs, all tan.\\"<br />As this head-bashing-yet-really-sweet-tale hits its first screeching chord progression, seventeen year-old Troy Billings contemplates jumping in front of an approaching subway train. A once average-sized child, he has eaten his way through years of depression after the death of his mother. Raised by his father, who is a retired military officer, and having experienced unrelenting contempt from a younger brother, who is a popular jock, Troy is certain that everyone is constantly eyeing him and laughing.<br />\\"First, the train is coming, its single headlight illuminating the dark tracks. I hear its deep rumble and take the fateful step forward. I want to picture myself flying dramatically through the air but realize I wouldn't have the muscle power to launch my body. Instead, I would plummet straight down. Maybe I wouldn't even get my other leg off the platform--my weight would pull me down like an anchor. That's how I see it.\\"<br />But Troy does not jump. Or plummet. His plans are rudely interrupted by the \\"disembodied voice\\" of a skinny teenager--Curt MacCrae--who is sitting in the dark behind him.<br />\\"He looks like a blond ferret. Stringy unwashed hair and huge eyes, jeans that are barely recognizable, stained white T-shirt, huge red overshirt, ratty old sweater...The sneakers, one Converse and one Nike, are both untied and the layers are all partially buttoned even though it's got to be one hundred degrees in the subway. The guy is so filthy I can hardly look at him. I mean, he's caked--looks like an old war victim from some black and white film.\\"<br />Curt, this majorly poor example of good hygiene, is a homeless, locally legendary punk guitarist who disappeared from the high school Troy attends. He is also a walking pharmacy. (He believes in self-inflicted health care.) Curt demands lunch from Troy for saving his life, and then informs the enormous young man that he, Troy, is to be the drummer in Curt's new band--a duo named Rage/Tectonic. That Troy has not played the drums since junior high is irrelevant--at least to Curt.<br />As Troy tries to conceive of a different self-image for himself and tries to overcome his paralyzing fears of what he believes everyone else is thinking of him, Curt's dicey health and his dicey relationship with Troy's dad and brother Dayle kept me alternately holding my breath and laughing so hard that I could barely catch it. Though much of Curt's on-the-fringe lifestyle remains an enigma to both Troy and to us, we do get vivid glimpses of the grunge and the glamor associated with being a teenage punk musician.<br />\\" 'You are punk rock, T. You just don't know it yet, and I don't know how to convince you.' \\"<br />FAT KID RULES THE WORLD is totally phat!

The idea still hangs around to this day, but at the time some people were upset when Adams's son John Quincy turned up.\\"<br />A book that will delight and reward students who've paid attention in their middle school or high school American History classes, HAIL TO THE CHIEFS had me giggling and snorting page after page.<br />\\"Grover Cleveland...weighed nearly three hundred pounds and wore an immense walrus mustache with bits of corned beef and cabbage in it. The orator Robert Ingersoll said he could 'slip his collar off over his head without unbuttoning it,' which gives you an idea of his neck, and he had a high squeaky voice and some unrefined personal habits. I've heard that when he was practicing law in Buffalo he couldn't be bothered to go down the hall and relieved himself through his office window, and once a passerby sued.<br />\\"People called him 'the Beast of Buffalo.' He was a bachelor, and no wonder.\\"<br />Footnotes, utilized for cheeky asides, are stacked up at the foot of many of the book's pages:<br />\\"Andrew Johnson should not be confused with Andrew Jackson. He didn't have Jackson's charm, or anyone else's either. 2<br />2 The White House staff called him 'The Grim Presence.' \\"<br />But, beyond the humor, this book provides fascinating stories and information about the Presidents that I have never run across elsewhere. The author notes of James Garfield (1881-1881):<br />\\"Garfield was tall and handsome and genial and scholarly. He believed that strikers had a right to strike and black men to vote and might have been a historically Good President if he'd stuck around long enough.\\"<br />The author goes on to talk about Garfield's shooting at the hands of a disaffected job-seeker who wanted to be the American consul in Paris:<br />\\"Everyone thought Garfield was a goner, and [Vice President] Arthur was already testing out the mattresses and deciding which furniture to get rid of, but at four in the morning the President was actually quite chipper and telling funny stories. \\"The doctors rallied round and tried everything they could lay hands on to dig for the bullet. The bullet was minding its own business and not bothering anyone, comfortably lodged behind the pancreas out of harm's way, but the doctors couldn't rest till they'd excavated. \\"Dr. Bliss hauled in the big Nelaton Probe and shoved it into the wound and twisted it around and around, looking for a pathway that felt like a bullet track. It made some interesting tracks of its own, and got wedged in the broken bits of a rib and had to be wrenched back out, but it didn't find any bullet. Then Bliss poked around with his fingers for a while, and called more doctors in from all over the country to poke with their fingers too, and pretty soon Garfield was a maze of secret passageways, but the bullet stayed put. \\"Then Alexander Graham Bell had a better idea. He was so pleased with histelephone that he thought it could do anything, and he rigged up a receiver with a primary and secondary coil that he said would hum when it got near the bullet. He brought it around, and they rubbed it all over Garfield, and once they did hear it hum, or anyway, they thought they did. 6 Bell showed the doctors where to go in and dig deeper and wider holes, and they did, but still no luck. 7<br />6 Some claim it was confused by the metal bedsprings...<br />7 The autopsy found it a good ten inches from where Bell said it was.\\"<br />HAIL TO THE CHIEFS is chock full of log cabins, land grabs, liquor, liars, and levity.

Disinherited and disgraced, Tobin is offered an opportunity for regaining his good name and, at the same time, saving the people of the Realm:<br />\\" 'If I bring down their leader, what will the goblins do?'<br />\\" 'If they were human, they'd probably thank you. But goblins are completely mercenary--they never do anything except for payment, or to avoid punishment. Once her hold over them is broken, they'll probably just run off...'<br />\\"Tobin drew a deep breath, his gaze wandering over the map, chest, stone, and charm. 'Isn't there any other way?'<br />\\"Master Lazur shook his head. 'The barbarians are coming. We have no place to go except north. They have no place to come except here. There is nothing in this world I would not sacrifice to get the Bright Realm behind the goblin wall in time. How high do you weigh the life of a sorceress, one who has killed again and again, against the survival of this whole realm?'<br />\\"Tobin's finger traced the river curve that marked his home. He couldn't imagine living in the woodlands, but he'd seen the barbarian armies for himself. Master Lazer was silent, letting him figure it out. Tobin didn't like it, but surely the priest was right. How many knights, men Tobin knew and respected, had already died? If it would end the war, save the whole realm, then the life of one sorceress was a cheap price to pay.\\"<br />But we know that \\"sorceress\\" whom he's being asked to \\"eliminate\\" is the young hedgewitch Makenna. She has pursued a relentless outlaw lifestyle since the priests enacted new rules of intolerance that destroyed a long-standing coexistence with the goblins and resulted in the slaughter of Makenna's mother.<br />What will Tobin, a principled young man, do when he learns what we know about Makenna? How will he reconcile his training that the goblins are merely vermin with the reality of meeting, talking, and seeing the real qualities that goblins possess? Why was Tobin's brother plotting against the Hierarch, the leadership of the Realm? And who is right and who is wrong when climactic changes trigger a widespread crisis, forcing a desperate and starving people to encroach upon the lands of a neighboring civilization?<br />THE GOBLIN WOOD begs comparison to analogous intercultural/international situations in the real world. It is also a captivating story of scheming and blundering, spells and slapstick, powers and paybacks.<br />\\" 'And you're human, whatever else you are.'<br />\\" 'Insults,' she snapped, 'will get you nowhere.' \\"<br />In addition to the human characters, Hilari Bell does a stellar job of creating the various groups of goblins--the bookeries, the stoners, the charmers, the trackers, and so on. She similarly succeeds at drawing individual goblins. As a whole, these goblins all possess just enough \\"humanity\\" to allow us to readily identify with them, while, at the same time, they are different in sufficient ways to prevent them from ever being human.<br />But why, Tobin ponders, do the goblins follow the girl?<br />\\"Was it possible the girl really was a common hedgewitch? If it was, then how had she defeated all the forces that had been sent against her? A small force could defeat a stronger one, but only if the leader of the small force was a very good tactician. To defeat stronger forces again and again, the leader had to be not merely a good tactician, but a truly great one. A general, in fact. Tobin scowled. A seventeen-year-old peasant girl? He couldn't believe it. But he found it no easier to believe that she was a mighty sorceress.\\"<br />The crown jewel of the story is Makenna, a young woman whose heart is torn between recalling the lessons of tolerance and charity her mother taught by example, and her fierce urge to protect the goblins and seek revenge upon those responsible for her mother's demise. Not an especially quick learner, nor a character whose actions we always agree with, her complexities and contradictions compel us to think, and are prime reasons why THE GOBLIN WOOD is a superb fantasy tale that deserves to be read and discussed.<br />Richie Partington...olerance and charity her mother taught by example, and her fierce urge to protect the goblins and seek revenge upon those responsible for her mother's demise.

The plot of Francine Prose's ridiculous tale has more holes than Camp Green Lake.  For instance, a student has an expensive cell phone belonging to his parent thrown out by a school administrator because the parent failed to read an email sent overnight banning cell phones at school.  That is the end of that plot line.  The parent never even asks about the cell phone that the student fails to bring home.  The student says nothing.  In another instance, a child who wears an AIDS ribbon ends up being sent away to a detention camp by the administration and murdered, all because of the desire to wear an AIDS ribbon.  Again, not a word from parents, friends, neighbors about the student's disappearance.  I look at a book, not at who wrote it, but the mystery of AFTER is how such [stuff] got published.  Obviously Prose has enough clout as a writer of adult books to bypass the editing process--or else the editor was sent to the same detention camp as Prose's characters.  I have never submitted a negative review to Amazon before, but this book merits an exception.	2003-05-19

You don't just give it away to someone else, even if you never asked for it in the first place.\\" --from FRICTION<br />Back in the spring of 1999, working as a Children's Buyer, I read an advance copy of Laurie Halse Anderson's SPEAK. My reaction to reading the book was to order a shelf-full for each of the stores. I wrote at the time that SPEAK should be required reading for all eighth-graders, both guys and girls.<br />Now, after reading SPEAK aloud to a couple of years' worth of eighth-grade English students, I can readily articulate some of its lessons:<br />We learn, of course, that Melinda shouldn't have put herself in danger by getting drunk in the dark with a bunch of older strangers. But then, after having gotten drunk and having been raped, we also know that Melinda could have avoided or mitigated that nightmare of a freshman year if either:<br />(1) She had spoken to adults she trusted about what had happened to her.<br />(2) Her friends and schoolmates had reacted to her unusual behavior (calling the cops, inconsistency in her physical appearance, skipping school, not speaking) by talking to Melinda or speaking about her to adults they trusted.<br />It is a totally different story, yet a very similar lesson that is encountered in FRICTION, an extraordinarily gripping tale designed for sixth, seventh, and eighth-graders.<br />FRICTION is written by E. R. (Emily) Frank, a young star who is ascending rapidly on the Y.A. horizon. As with reading SPEAK, FRICTION left me misty-eyed as I finished it.<br />In FRICTION, an innocent young girl's budding sexuality contributes to the terrible confusion--and, ultimately, to the tragic consequences--when Stacy, a new (and older) classmate begins what appears to be an insidious campaign to portray their young and very popular teacher, Simon, as a \\"pervert.\\"<br />Alex, the seventh-grade soccer-playing girl, narrates the story of what happens after Stacy arrives at the progressive private school attended by Alex and Tim. Stacy is the girl with secrets who knows how to make an entrance:<br />\\"She's got shiny black hair down to her behind and gray eyes that take up her whole face, and she's as skinny as I am. She's wearing a purple-and-black turtleneck and jeans that look brand-new, and she grins at everybody like she's totally psyched to meet us. She's got a gap between her two front teeth.<br />\\" ' Hi,' she goes. 'I'm Stacy.' I see a flash of silver in her mouth. A tongue ring. 'Let's get this party started.'<br />\\"And that's how it begins.\\"<br />Stacy's behavior and her unrelenting proclamations to the students about what's going on threatens the life-long friendship that Alex has with Tim. Alex becomes more and more uncertain in her own mind as to what the truth really is:<br />\\"I want things to make sense now, but...the things I need to figure out don't have rules. Like why Stacy wants it to be true that Simon and I like each other in that certain way. Like why I've been scared lately that maybe she's right. What if Simon does look at me?\\"<br />As with SPEAK, things spiral out of control because of the failure--by every one of the students--to confide in an adult. The events result in Alex's loss of that innocent childhood image of Simon as a teacher; she instead begins to see him as a man.<br />(And, so here we go again...)<br />Many educators apparently get weak-kneed about teaching SPEAK to eighth graders--preferring to ignore its value to those eighth-graders who could well wind up in Melinda's position. Fearing the \\"mature\\" content (or fearing other adults who haven't even read the book), they pass off all responsibility to high school teachers, thus diminishing the possibility that its vital message will be heard in time by students at risk. (Melinda notes sarcastically in SPEAK how they don't get around to learning about sex at Merryweather until eleventh grade.)<br />Similarly,with teaching FRICTION, I could hear the tension start building about five paragraphs back: \\"SIXTH GRADE!!! Discuss WHAT?!!! BUDDING SEXUALITY?!!! IMPROPER PHYSICAL CONTACT AND SEXUAL ABUSE?!!!\\"<br />That's right, let's all procrastinate until an age that it's all ridiculously beside the point. Sorry. If it were me, I'd willingly take on a thousand irate parents/administrators/school board members if it meant that I could save one kid from going through the trauma Melinda faces in SPEAK or that Alex, Tim, Stacy, and Simon all face in FRICTION.<br />This will be a book you'll be hearing plenty about in the coming year.<br />Richie Partington<br />....arly, with teaching FRICTION, I could hear the tension start building about five paragraphs back: \\"SIXTH GRADE!!!

I know plenty of students who walk around with those fat paperbacks, and when I used to work at the bookstore I certainly sold plenty of them--both in hard and softcover. Therefore, I sort of know what science fiction looks like, but I couldn't even give you a definition of the genre.<br />Furthermore, I'm not really keen on books (or movies for that matter) with lots of violent battle scenes.<br />So, why then did I find WARCHILD--a work of science fiction (actually published for adults) which was well-stocked with violent battle scenes--impossible to put down? And why do I think it's a great book for young adults?<br />I was captivated by the vividly drawn young main character Joslyn Aaron Musey as well as the four complex adults who are his most influential teachers: the pirate, Falcone; the alien sympathizer, Nikolas-dan (a.k.a. Warchild); the deep space ship captain, Cairo Azarcon; and Corporal Erret Dorr. I guess it all comes down to the fact that no matter how many aliens and high tech weapons you jam into a well-written, politically savvy, coming of age story, it's still a well-written, politically savvy, coming of age story. Or, perhaps, I'm much more of a science fiction fan than I ever knew I was. The brilliance of WARCHILD has certainly opened me up to that possibility.<br />The book has an unusual and powerful opening: Part I is told in the second person as the author plunks us down into the body of eight-year-old Jos just as Falcone's pirate ship, the Genghis Khan, attacks and destroys Jos' home--the merchant ship on which Jos' parents are stationed. Taken by Falcone, Jos spends a year in virtual isolation as the pirate trains, teaches, and intimidates the young boy. Falcone is then audacious enough to dock at the EarthHub station, Chaos, where several government spacecarriers are also docked, in order to treat the boy to a birthday celebration. As fate would have it, an alien ship chooses the occasion to attack. In the initial commotion Jos jams his dessert fork into Falcone's hand and runs for the nearest exit. Falcone, who has promised to shoot Jos if he attempts any such thing, tries to carry through on his threat in the midst of the battle going on:<br />\\"Way down the dockring, almost out of sight from the curve of the walls, a small explosion went off at one of the locks. You hauled yourself up, moving slow in the rush. Your head pounded and smoke stung your eyes. You held your arm and tried to veer toward one of the carrier ramps.<br />\\"Then new faces poured out of that blown lock.<br />\\"They weren't human. They were tattooed, with skin in colors you'd never seen before on a face except as a mask. They shot at the soljets, sharp bright pulses. The soljets stopped boarding, knelt behind cargo bins, loaders, and ramps, shooting back in stiff streamers of bright red. It was a noisy station festival, full of light and color, except people were dying. Merchants and Chaos citizens caught in the cross fire fell.<br />\\"You froze. You had never before seen an alien. They came closer around the dockring, moving with the precision of skill and focused aim. They wore long outer robes that fluttered behind them, as if they were flying. None of the soljets paid attention to you now. \\"Someone grabbed you over the face. You recognized the smell of the hand.<br />\\"You bit. He released you and you ran straight into the platoon of soljets ahead of you.<br />\\" 'Drop the gun!' one of the jets yelled.<br />\\"Falcone might've been chasing you. You didn't look. You ran as fast as you could. People screamed at you to stop and get out of the way. An alien face looked at you from across the decreasing distance of jet-occupied dock. The eyes were completely black.<br />\\"A fist slammed into your back and threw you to the deck. The last word you heard wasn't one you understood.<br />\\"That was all I remembered about Falcone. It was enough.\\"<br />The choices and challenges Jos faces through the following years periodically threaten to rip him in half. The politics of the prolonged interstellar war are reminiscent of many of today's international conflicts--fighting over resources with accompanying deceit and doubletalk on both sides. Falcone, who had once been a spacecarrier captain, but had acted so autonomously in deep space as to be discredited and jailed before political allies broke him out, makes me think of the great British explorers such as Drake who were so far from the homeland that they acted on their own and were considered pirates by most of the world.<br />Smart and with a lot of heart, WARCHILD is great science fiction for young adults--whatever science fiction is. I know Jos is a kid who is out there, just waiting to be born two hundred years from now.wing years periodically threaten to rip him in half.

In writing a detailed biography of the most infamous human being of the last hundred years, the author has put together a fascinating story that never lets up. In doing so, Mr. Giblin also provides a clear overview of the events leading up to and through the second world war. Beginning with the haunting cover, the book is illustrated with large, clear photographs of the significant people and places we encounter, as well as several well-drawn caps to which I'd periodically refer as I read the book.<br />\\"To celebrate his triumph, Hitler planned a sightseeing tour of Paris, a city he had long admired but never visited. His favorite architect, Albert Speer, accompanied the F&uuml;hrer as he visited the ornate Paris Opera, drove down the broad Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, stopped at the Eiffel Tower, and lingered for a long time at the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte. The three-hour tour through almost completely deserted streets--the French deliberately stayed away--ended on the heights of Montmartre, long known as a district for artists. Perhaps its narrow streets and outdoor caf&eacute;s reminded Hitler of his youthful days in Vienna, when he himself had dreamed of being an artist.\\"<br />THE LIFE AND DEATH OF ADOLF HITLER does an exceptional job answering the questions of how Hitler was able to gain control of the German government, and how his forces and henchmen were able to succeed so horrifically and effectively before they were finally halted. We see how the long-term effects of the Versailles Treaty on Germany lead almost inevitably to the opportunity for Hitler's rise to power. We are reminded of the significant anti-Semitism in the US, Britain, and other countries that figured into their less-than-stellar response to Hitler's aggression and genocide.

Forty rooms in all. When the hotel is fully booked, as it is this week, there are often over a hundred people in the building. All strangers to one another, coming and going. Eating and laughing and breathing and sleeping and dreaming under the same roof.<br />\\"They leave things behind sometimes, the guests. A bottle of scent. A crumpled handkerchief. A pearl button that fell off a dress and rolled under a bed. And sometimes they leave other sorts of things. Things you can't see. A sigh trapped in a corner. Memories tangled in the curtains. A sob fluttering against a windowpane like a bird that flew in and can't get back out. I can feel these things. They dart and crouch and whisper.<br />\\"I get to the bottom of the staircase and listen. The only sound is the ticking of the clock. To my right is the dining room. It's dark and empty. Straight ahead, through the porch windows, I can see the boathouse and the lake, calm and still, its black surface silvered by the moon. I pray I don't run into anyone. Not Mrs. Morrison waiting up for her husband. Or Mr. Sperry doing the accounts as he does when he can't sleep. Or, God forbid, table six lurking in a corner like some horrible spider.<br />\\"I walk under the antler chandelier in the foyer, and by the coat tree made of branches and deer hooves. I pass the hallway that leads to the parlor and get a fright when I see light spilling out of the room onto the hall carpet, but then I remember: That's where Grace Brown is laid out. Mrs. Morrison left a lamp burning because it's unkind to leave the dead all alone in the dark. They have darkness enough ahead of them.\\"<br />Our narrator is sixteen-year-old Mattie (Mathilda) Gokey, who has just snuck out of the attic where the young female employees sleep. Grace Brown is the unfortunate, young, dead woman who is about to cause a sensation. She was just discovered, along with an overturned canoe, after she and her male companion failed to return to the resort hotel for supper.<br />Shortly before the events that befell her, Grace had slipped a packet of letters to Mattie, and had instructed her to burn them.<br />Like Mattie doesn't have enough problems already! After her mother died and her brother split town following an altercation with their angry father, unpleasant Pa makes it clear that Mattie's priority is to help run the farm and raise her three younger sisters. But Mattie is a gifted writer and passionate scholar who is determined to earn her high school diploma and surreptitiously longs to hoard sufficient money to leave town herself--for a college education in turn of the century New York City. Her accomplice is a neighbor, a black kid named Weaver, who is also a brilliant scholar and whose own dream is to somehow make it through law school and avenge some of the really bad stuff he's seen go down.<br />It's hard enough trying to battle ignorance in 2002! It'll drive you crazy watching and listening to several of these bossy (dare I say stupid) white men from a hundred years ago. And then to also watch Mattie in her weaker moments, battling her raging hormones, is almost too much to bear.<br />Author Jennifer Donnelly deftly juggles all of these issues, along with the murder of Grace Brown, as we nervously root for Mattie to somehow make it through those minefields without detonating another foolish male character or her equally foolish Aunt Josie. Young adult readers will so easily relate to Mattie and Weaver despite their having lived a hundred years ago. That Ms. Donnelly is able to achieve this while staying so consistent to the historic fictional setting makes A NORTHERN LIGHT a story that will be enjoyed by historic and contemporary fiction aficionados alike.<br />Richie Partington&lt;BR....oyed by historic and contemporary fiction aficionados alike. <br />Richie Partington<BR....	2003-03-25

She left Macy home. Since it looked like a nice day, she decided to leave him in the backyard...Then to make sure he didn't follow her or wander off, she took the loose end of an old rope that was wrapped around the swing and tied it tightly to his ankle.\\"<br /><br />\\"The big day has come<br /><br />The bell is sounding<br /><br />I run my hands through my hair one last time<br /><br />Outside the prison walls the town is gathering<br /><br />People are trading crime for crime...\\" --Ani Difranco<br /><br />\\"The sky above the yard had become dark with clouds. A drop landed in Macy's eye and another drop hit his cheek. Then the rain became steady. Macy hadn't had anything to drink for hours, so he closed his eyes, turned his face toward the sky, opened his mouth wide, and caught the drops until his thirst was satisfied.<br /><br />\\"But the rain didn't stop...His clothes were soaked and he was cold. He crawled under the seat of the swing for protection as the rain became a downpour. Then, when night came, he curled up in the mud and shivered. He never cried.\\"<br /><br />\\"...Everyone needs to see the prisoner<br /><br />They need to make it even easier<br /><br />They see me as a symbol, and not a human being<br /><br />That way they can kill me<br /><br />Say it's not murder, it's a metaphor<br /><br />We are killing off our own failure and starting clean...\\"<br /><br />\\"Macy's teachers were concerned about his poor academic and social skills, but when they called to schedule meetings with his mother, she said she was too busy. All the years Macy was in school, she never met with even one of his teachers. By the end of middle school Macy had stopped going. What should have been Macy's first year of high school was spent in a state juvenile correctional facility, where he had been sent for shoplifting at a liquor store.\\"<br /><br />\\"...I think guilt and innocence they are a matter of degree<br /><br />What might be justice to you might not be justice to me<br /><br />I went too far, I'm sorry<br /><br />I guess now I'm going home<br /><br />So let any amongst you cast the first stone...\\"<br /><br />\\"The store clerk, Mohammad Aziz, should have been off that night, but he was filling in for his boss. Mohammad had recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and four children, and he welcomed the opportunity to earn extra money. This one night of work would pay for next week's celebration of his son's tenth birthday...<br /><br />\\"Mohammad was uneasy when he saw Macy. There was nothing extraordinary about Macy's size or clothing, but his face revealed a history of violence. There were several fresh scars, his nose was knocked off center like it had been hit by a truck, and his front teeth were broken. His head was completely shaven to conform to the popular style at juvie. Macy liked the bald look because it was easy to maintain without the help of barbers. The confinement of barber chairs and being touched by people with scissors always made Macy feel uncomfortable.\\"<br /><br />\\"...You might be the wrong color<br /><br />You might be too poor<br /><br />Justice isn't something just anyone can afford<br /><br />You might not pull the trigger<br /><br />You might be out in the car<br /><br />And you might get a lethal injection<br /><br />'Cause we take a metaphor that far...\\"<br /><br />\\"On the day of his release Macy went straight to the city and stole an old car. It was a massive gray wreck, at least twenty-five years old, with a rusted hood and a wire clothes hanger where the antenna used to be. The car was so worthless, the owner had left the key in the ignition, hoping someone would take it.

And because I am writing a true story of my life I have to talk about school, since I am still a kid and it is a very big part of my Heart-Wrenching Life Story and Amazing Adventures. I am sorry to report that school is heavy on the Heart-Wrenching but so far has been running low-to-empty on Amazing Adventures.\\"<br />Several of my favorite YA's from recent years--SPEAK, YOU DON'T KNOW ME, and the upcoming A NORTHERN LIGHT immediately come to mind--tell stories of young characters whose transformation is instigated by an insightful teacher who thinks and operates \\"outside the box.\\" While written for a slightly younger audience, Esm&eacute; Raji Codell's first children's novel, SAHARA SPECIAL, which is set in Chicago, stands alongside the others in this regard:<br />\\"In she walked. Our new teacher!<br />\\"I blinked, and blinked again. Her hair was copper like a lucky penny, but when the light hit it a certain way, it seemed almost green, a deep green, like she colored it with a dye made from tree leaves. It was held back with sparkling dragonfly barrettes, but there was no help for it. It was wild hair. She was pale, but I couldn't tell for sure if she was white or Asian or Puerto Rican, or maybe light-skinned black. When someone is wearing lipstick as purple as an eggplant, it's hard to tell. She wore lime eye shadow and heavy black liquid eyeliner, making her expression catlike. She wore a yellow dress that looked like it was made of tissue paper, kind of old-fashioned and grandmotherly, but hanging slightly over her shoulder. Her bra strap was showing. It was also purple. She looked less like a teacher and more like one of those burnt-out punk-rocker teenagers who hang out in front of the Dunkin' Donuts on Belmont, near the L stop. Only grown.\\"<br />Sahara is in need of a new start as she begins to repeat last year's grade. She and Darrell Sikes spent much of the previous school year working in the hallway, getting \\"Individualized Attention\\" (the source of her nickname, Sahara Special)--<br />\\"---and let me tell you, working in the hallway with a teacher is like being the street person of the school. People pass you by, and they act like they don't see you, but three steps away they've got a whole story in their heads about why you're out there instead of in the nice cozy classroom where you belong. Stupid? Unlucky? Unloved? If I could have put out a cup, I would have made some change.\\"<br />But things do change for Sahara, Darrell, and their classmates when the school hires a new teacher from \\"Somewhere Else.\\" Her name--<br />\\"--'is Madame Poitier, Miss PWAH-tee-YAY. It rhymes with touch&eacute;, a French word that means, \\"you got me.\\" ' \\"<br />And to the benefit of Sahara and Darrell, \\"Miss Pointy,\\" as she is frequently called, doesn't believe in reading what previous teachers have said about you. What Miss Pointy does have a thing for is the power of story. Readers will join Sahara in learning a thing or three about understanding and writing stories.<br />Similarly, teachers and other grownups might well join young readers in learning their own thing or three from Miss Pointy's teaching methods. One of my favorites is her trouble basket:<br />\\"Miss Pointy tries to get us to leave our problems at home. She stands at the doorway every morning, smiling like she's auditioning to be a movie star, but she blocks the door and nobody gets in until they use the trouble basket. We pretend to put our troubles into the big green basket she holds out before we enter. Our troubles are invisible to the eye, but they are heavy. She practically breaks her back, holding all those troubles for us, but she says we can't carry them into the classroom ourselves or we won't be able to work. She offers the troubles back to us at the end of the day, since they don't belong to her. Nobody's taken them back.\\"<br />This is one that I can't wait to read aloud--fifth toseventh grade seems the prime audience--so that I can share with them the story of this troubled-yet-talented girl whose entire class is transformed by a very cool teacher.<br />Richie Partingtoneventh grade seems the prime audience--so that I can share with them the story of this troubled-yet-talented girl whose entire class is transformed by a very cool teacher. <br />Richie Partington	2003-03-25

It was a foggy early morning on campus--I'd just come from voting--and I was explaining how, in contrast to the many stories where the bullies/jocks/student \\"leaders\\" had the satisfaction of seeing their victims beaten down and acting victimized, here you had a new, \\"strange\\" kid (Jinsen) who won't give them that satisfaction. There's a point in the story where one of the school's predators (part of the group who'd jumped Jinsen/\\"Buddha Boy\\" the day before) corners the story's narrator, Justin, and complains:<br />\\" ' Why do you hang out with him? Why do you stick up for him? The kid's a freak, he doesn't even belong here.' I opened my mouth, but he wasn't done; in a weird way it was like he wasn't even talking to me, but to Jinsen somehow through me, like I was a translator, a gateway. 'He wears freak clothes, he acts like a freak, he sure talks like a freak--'<br />\\" ' Well, ignore him,' my voice a little better, a little stronger, but not much. 'Just, just pretend he's not--'<br />\\" ' Ignore him! How can you ignore him? You know what he said to me yesterday? when he, when we were-- He said, \\"If it makes you happy.\\" That's what he said. \\"Go on, if it makes you happy.\\" What the hell is that supposed to mean?' Yelling now, but again not at me: it was as if he were arguing with Jinsen, arguing with himself, his face getting redder and redder and 'You tell him,' poking me in the chest, big fat hot-dog finger, 'tell him to stay the hell away from me. Just tell him that.' \\"<br />As the story begins, Justin tells us that:<br />\\"Our little group--we'd been buddies since middle school, Jakob and Megan and me--was mostly somewhere in the middle, never invited to the big-deal parties but not exiled to the outer limits, either. It's not a bad place to be, the middle: it's comfortable, it's easy, and it's safe. And I'd probably still be there if it wasn't for Jinsen.\\"<br />A big part of Justin is clearly reluctant to leave that safe place. Frequently, we find him mumbling to himself that he's not Jinsen's friend--they just hang out together sometimes. Even Justin's friends think that he is nuts. But Justin is truly intrigued and impressed by the boy with the bald head, beatific smile, and incredible artistic ability:<br />\\"I was still watching Jinsen: calm gaze and careful hands, no wasted motion, working on his print as if it were any day, as if yesterday's bad news or the great news today were all just...part of everything, and he was just taking everything as it came, how could he do that? How could he keep on doing that? Balls? Luck? Karma?\\"<br />And what is Justin's role when Jinsen consistently takes it all and smiles? Justin, who has become more and more furious about what he sees happening, muses:<br />\\"In history, in a movie, in a book, you can always tell who the heroes are: they're the ones rushing into a burning building, giving crucial testimony in the courtroom, refusing to step to the back of the bus. They're the ones who act the way you hope you would, if the moment came to you.<br />\\"But the movies and the history books never tell you how they felt, those heroes, if they were angry or uncertain or afraid, if they had to think a long time before they did the right thing, if they even knew what the right thing was or just made a headlong guess, just leaped and hoped they landed instead of falling. They never tell you what it's like to stand on the brink, wishing you were somewhere--or someone--else, wishing the choice had never come your way and you could just go back to your safe, ordinary, everyday life. \\"Because you know what else the books never say? Nobody, hero or not, really wants to rush into a fire. Because fire burns.\\"<br />This compelling tale of Justin's transformation firmly establishes Kathe Koja as a young adult novelist.

It's my choice.<br />There's not too much I really have a choice<br />about. Mom would say I chose to leave my room<br />at home, but that's not something anyone would do<br />without a real good reason. There's no place<br />for me there since she got married. Like, one time, I knocked<br />her husband's trophy off his gun safe,<br />and he twisted my arm--hard. I never feel safe<br />when he's around. I finally asked my mom to make a choice:<br />him or me. She went, Oh, Katie, he'll be fine. Then she knocked<br />on our wooden table. I blew up. I stormed out of the room<br />and started thinking hard. In the first place,<br />I know he won't be fine. I didn't tell her what he tries to do<br />to me when she works late. In a way, I want to, but even if I do,<br />she won't believe me. She thinks we're safe<br />in that so-called nice neighborhood. Finally, Katie, a place<br />of our own. And since she took a vow, she thinks she has no choice<br />but to see her marriage through. No room<br />for me, no vow to protect me if he comes knocking<br />on my door late at night. He knocks<br />and then walks in when I don't answer. Or even when I do<br />answer: Stay out! This is my room<br />and you can't come in! I could never be safe<br />there, with him in the house. So, sure, I made a choice.<br />I left home and found my way to this place,<br />where I've been these past two weeks. And I found a place<br />to work, thirty hours a week. Today Mom knocked<br />on the door here. She wanted to talk. I told her, You made your choice;<br />I made mine. She wondered what she could do<br />to get me to come home. But when I said, It's not safe<br />for me as long as he's there, she left the room.<br />My choice is to be safe.<br />This room is dark and musty, but it's one place<br />I do know I can answer no when someone knocks.\\"<br />The use of those words over and over in a sestina--safe, knock, choice, room--I feel like I can really step into Katie's skin after reading the piece. Throughout this awesome verse novel we are able to step into the skin of a variety of kids--kids who all have problems that cause them to leave their \\"real\\" homes. What we find is that these young people are caring of each other and that they care about the future. You will like these kids. You'll like it at Keesha's house.<br />In this next piece--a sonnet instead of a sestina--we are shown why all these young people have been able to go to a safe place and stay there for free:<br />i know the value..........JOE<br />\\"I know the value of a house like this.<br />Old and solid, hardwood stairs and floor.<br />But when I showed up at Aunt Annie's door<br />when I was twelve--bruised, scared, clenched fists--<br />all I knew was: I could stay.<br />As long as you need to, Joe, was what she kept<br />on saying, right up till she died and left<br />the house to me. So now that's what I say<br />when kids show up and I know they can't ask<br />for what they shouldn't have to ask for. They need<br />more than I can give them. I know I'm<br />no Aunt Annie. I ain't up to the task<br />of tryin' to be their legal foster dad.<br />But I can give them space--and space is time.\\"<br />Keesha is the girl living there who has put out the word about Joe's/Aunt Annie's house.

For me it was junior high in the late 60's when I'd be constantly harassed by older or bigger kids. Walk down the hall or down the stairs and get tripped or shoved into a locker or have your books slammed out of your arms sending your papers flying everywhere. Sit on the school bus and be whacked with a book by a passerby or have your hat snatched. Occasionally I remember an even bigger kid coming along and asserting his dominance over the bully who was picking on me -- yep, that was me, the bottom of the food chain--but usually these incidents became solitary, painful memories of the time when I was a good, quiet student treading water in a sea of raging hormones.<br />I cannot recall ever having the urge to exact revenge (beyond a hand gesture). But, then again, it was a time that, in retrospect, seemed to pass soon enough as I came into my own in high school. But what would I have been like if I'd had to endure year after year of such torture through high school as well as junior high?<br />In GIVE A BOY A GUN by Todd Strasser, we meet two teenage boys who, after enduring years of torture by their school's most popular students, do take revenge. In a fictional account which recalls real-life school shootings in Littleton (CO), Jonesboro (AK), and Springfield (OR), the two teens take a group of students and teachers hostage at a dance in the high school gymnasium.<br />Strasser presents the story in the form of quotes by the teens (Brendan Lawlor and Gary Searle) as well as their friends, their tormentors and other schoolmates, current and former teachers, their parents and neighbors.<br />At the foot of many pages the author provides us with facts concerning gun availability, violence and manufacture as well as quotes relating to those tragic real episodes which have been occurring in schools across America. (Information Strasser has compiled includes the federal estimate that there are roughly 250 million people and 240 million firearms in America, that 12 percent of students say they know another student who has brought a gun to school, and that in 1996 there were more than 6,000 American students expelled for bringing a gun to school.)<br />In the story we learn how the physical and verbal abuse heaped daily upon the two teens by popular football players and the in-crowd is tolerated by the faculty. We meet teachers who, themselves, treat the unpopular kids as outcasts in the classroom. As Allison Findley (Gary's girlfriend) points out: \\"If Deirdre Bunsun is talking in world history, it's like 'Excuse me, Deirdre, now pay attention.' But if Allison Findley is talking, Ms. Arnold stops the class and stares at her. And then the rest of the kids stare at her. It's a light slap on the wrist for Dierdre, it's public humiliation for Allison.\\"<br />We come to understand how Brendan, Gary, and their little circle of friends seek to escape from unremitting daily reinforcement of the message that they are worthless vermin. We hear from Gary's mom who was concerned about his spending the better part of Saturdays \\"cocooned within his quilt.\\" We learn how Brendan grows up hating and reacting to injustices, is at one point compared to Rosa Parks by an old friend, and tries to take out his aggressions on video games. We see transcripts of their chatroom discussions. We hear how over a period of years the boys' desire to kill the kids who are torturing them evolves from the relatively innocent anger of youngsters to the determined and complicated planning that leads to the story's climactic evening in the gymnasium. Allison Findley wonders at one point about the darkness that she has seen developing in Brendan: \\"I don't know where it came from. Whether it had always been inside him, or whether it just started to grow because of the way people treated him in school.\\"<br />Several of the story's most insightful quotes are from an overburdened school counselor, Beth Bender, who survives that night in the gym: \\"And that's when I had an epiphany. Can't you see why they were doing it? They had no protection. They couldn't get away from the bullies and tormentors. Not here, not in jail, not anywhere. So why not kill them? So why not kill themselves? What difference would it make either way? In another passage Beth refutes the assertion that this was an unpreventable act by crazies. \\"Every year you hear about kids walking into their school and shooting classmates and teachers. You don't hear about them walking into McDonald's and shooting people. They don't go to the town swimming pool or the movies and do it. Most of these kids live in neighborhoods with elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. But they don't go to some other school. They always go to their own school. It's not random. It's a message, and the sooner we wake up and listen, the better.<br />A message that Beth wants us to hear is that parents, teachers, administrators, and thoughtful students with influence on their peers need to begin the process of instituting programs and procedures to teach conflict resolution, to teach respect for one another's differences, and to prohibit the teasing, the physical and the verbal abuse that we see Gary and Brendan having to endure from all the way back in grade school. There needs to be zero tolerance of name-calling and the other abuse these boys are subjected to. Of course, the book's other theme is the gun issue. It appears that the debate over guns in America will continue beyond my lifetime, but, clearly, the fact that temperamental, hormonal teenagers are so easily able to obtain guns is an issue that has got to be addressed sooner rather than later.<br />Todd Strasser surely has written one of the year's most thought-provoking books.

Victor looked up in surprise. 'I've tracked down a lot of things in my time--suitcases, dogs, a couple of escaped lizards, and some husbands--but you are the first clients to come to me because they've lost their children, Mr. and Mrs....?' He looked at them inquisitively.<br />'Hartlieb,' the woman answered. 'Esther and Max Hartlieb.'<br />'And they are NOT our children,' her husband stated firmly, which immediately earned him an angry look from his pointy-nosed wife.\\"<br />Recently I wrote about food and nutrition books. On occasion, someone will start getting all filled with awe when they hear about my diet since college--no meat, no additives, no caffeine, no white sugar. But whenever that happens, Shari will roll her eyes and make one of those noises of disgust, before launching into her \\"Don't-let-him-fool-you\\" rap about how I sure as heck have a sweet tooth, even if I don't eat white sugar.<br />(Shrug.) I plead guilty--Me 'n Pooh Bear would make a great team. I can eat heaping platefuls of the honey and molasses-sweetened oatmeal raisin cookies that Shari bakes for me. Give me those and a mason jar full of chamomile tea--that's MY comfort food.<br />THE THIEF LORD is comfort food. Beautifully evocative descriptions of Venice where the story takes place, a great cast of consistantly well-formed characters, most of whom you come to love, and a tale that at first drifts gently from chapter to chapter, like the little waves that lap at the rocky feet of houses along the Venitian canals. But, while the voices may dance softly across the page, this adventurous tale that centers around two orphan brothers and the detective who is hired to track them down is quite cleverly crafted, containing as many wild twists and narrow, unnamed alleys as does the city of Venice itself. And then, just when you feel like you've got the lay of the land, you zag right off the map.<br />THE THIEF LORD, which is already a wildly-popular bestseller in Germany where it was first published, is an utter joy to read. It is another one that I'll be impatiently awaiting the chance to read aloud to the family. If word gets out how great this one is, Barry Cunningham, the man known for discovering J.K.

I don't care that its fiction--I will be clenching my fists for days as I recall the results of the havoc wrecked by the insanity of the adult world upon the story's three young central characters: Hart, who narrates the story, his sister Alice, and Alice's best friend Mitsy Sennosuke--a girl of Japanese parents.<br />Before moving to California as a young man, I had never heard of the Japanese internment during World War II--nope, it wasn't ever mentioned in the history books they used back on the East Coast in my youth. So, I am not at all surprised to learn from THE DIVINE WIND that a similar \\"procedure\\" took place in Australia. Nor am I shocked by the manner in which the Australian white supremacists in the book treat individuals of the various nonwhite groups. But the way in which those prejudices and the War engulf the three young people and totally screw up what should have been their idyllic young lives brought me to the verge of utter despair as I read page after page of Hart's touching love story:<br />\\"I fell in love with Mitsy in the darkness of the tin-walled cinema in Sheba Lane, where cowboys roamed the range and airmen spies slipped away from foreign countries in the light of the moon, and great white hunters saved beautiful women from maddened rogue elephants.<br />\\"In the daylight, Mitsy was a separate being, slim and restless and full of jokes and mischief like Alice, but when the lights were dimmed and the screen glowed with lovers and heroes, she would grow quiet and still, and settle in her seat, and imperceptibly shift until her shoulder and knee touched mine. Alice, on the other side of her, would crane her head around and meet my gaze, but never say anything, or tease, just as Mitsy would never acknowledge the intimacy when the lights came on at the end but simply treat me as one of the gang again. I sometimes thought that I dreamed of her.\\"<br />In stark contrast to the other white adult characters, Hart and Alice's father, Michael Penrose, is the one that I'd want to know. A complex, good-hearted guy who makes one awful mistake, he repeatedly stands up and speaks loudly for what is right. In addition, the colorful, multiethnic supporting cast is a lively crowd that had me smiling despite the horrors that they frequently bore the brunt of.<br />THE DIVINE WIND: A LOVE STORY takes us to a rugged and beautiful place at a tough time in history and introduces us to three young people who I hope are still out there somewhere--old and at peace.<br />Richie Partington<br />[...]thought that I dreamed of her.\\" <br />In stark contrast to the other white adult characters, Hart and Alice's father, Michael Penrose, is the one that I'd want to know.

He died a few days later. SCLC [The Southern Christian Leadership Conference] announced a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery, fifty-four miles away, to protest Jackson's murder.<br />\\"On Sunday, March 7 [1965], late in the afternoon, John Lewis and SCLC's Hosea Williams led nearly six hundred marchers from the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which leads out of Selma toward Montgomery. They could not see over the steep span until they reached the middle of the bridge. There on the other side was 'a sea of blue,' Lewis remembered: 'Alabama state troopers.' Behind them were row upon row of white civilians deputized that morning by Sheriff Clark, many of them on horseback. Lewis looked down to the muddy water one hundred feet below. 'Can you swim?' Hosea Williams asked him.<br />\\" 'No,' Lewis answered. Neither could Williams.\\"<br />Lewis and Williams then knelt to pray and passed the word back for all the marchers to do the same. As history recorded--both in words and in famous, stomach-churning photos--the troopers attacked the marchers, fracturing Lewis' skull with a billy club. Two weeks later, after a federal judge had ruled that the march could proceed, a line of marchers that swelled to twenty-five thousand people made that journey to Montgomery.<br />As a child on Long Island, I watched the television reports and read the magazine articles about the march. The bravery of the marchers and the media's coverage of those atrocities performed by the troopers under the direction of their boss, Governor George Wallace, turned the tide of national opinion--the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law a few months later.<br />That young black man with the fractured skull, a disciple of Gandhi and King, had already been putting his body on the line for years prior to that Bloody Sunday thirty-seven years ago. Estranged from his family for his involvement in the Civil Rights movement, arrested more than forty times in his determination to change the way African Americans were treated in America, John Lewis eventually became US Congressman John Lewis, currently serving an Atlanta-centered district in his eighth term. Lewis has served most of those years as a deputy whip in the Democratic caucus.<br />In a solid, clearly-written biography for middle grade students, Christine M. Hill presents the story of this lesser-known American hero. The author relies heavily on Lewis' own autobiography (WALKING WITH THE WIND, Simon & Schuster, 1998) as well as articles by and about him. We follow Lewis' life, starting with his childhood as an Alabama sharecropper's son, his preaching his first sermon at sixteen, and his training to sit on the bus as a Freedom Rider--where he would be severely beaten for the first of many times:<br />\\"On the night before the trip started, John Lewis dined out for the first time. Growing up in Alabama and going to school in Nashville, he had never eaten in an elegant restaurant. He had never sat with blacks and whites together, conversing pleasantly over dinner. He savored the unfamiliar, but delicious Chinese food. He admired the handsome, silvery serving platters. But none of the volunteers could forget the next day's purpose.

While I have not read the adult version, I can tell you that this edition of the author's compelling account of the real-life catastrophe of 1820-21, in which a whale attacks a whaleship in the middle of the Pacific, was detailed and gory enough to keep me horrified for hours, to the extent that it caused me to forget all about my initial delight that at least one whale had apparently gotten even with humankind for what our forefathers had done for the sake of lamp oil and ambergris.<br />Your mama told you never<br />to eat your friends<br />with your fingers and<br />hands, but I say you<br />ought to eat what<br />you will - shove it<br />in your mouth any way<br />that you can. --Silver Spoon by Grace Slick<br />Utilizing primary source material, including two accounts written by survivors of the wreck about their nightmarish journey across thousands of miles of the Pacific from the middle of nowhere to their rescue off the coast of Chile, the author has crafted a first-rate adventure story that is also a tale of unbearable tragedy.<br />\\"Like a giant bird of prey, the whaleship moved lazily up the western coast of South America, zigging and zagging across a living sea of oil. For that was the Pacific Ocean in 1821, a vast field of warm-blooded oil deposits known as sperm whales.\\"<br />From the early portions of this saga, which take place before an obstinate, eighty-five foot long sperm whale decides that enough is enough, we learn a vast array of information about the port of Nantucket and the whaleships. The author clearly describes and provides illustrations of the ship's layout, including the names of the masts and individual sails, the crews makeup, including their respective duties and the system of remuneration, their navigational tools, and the graphic details of converting those floating oil deposits into big bucks for the shipowners. I was amazed to discover that the wind patterns dictate that in order to sail from New England around the 'Horn to the Pacific, the whalers would nearly scrape the west coast of Africa! And the fact that ambergris--literally worth more than its weight in gold to perfume manufacturers--was generated as the result of whale constipation.<br />But it's also fascinating to learn at the end about the later lives of those eight men who somehow survived for three months on the ocean in the worst of circumstances--and how the son of one of those survivors grew up to become a whaler, lent a shipmate his father's account of the Essex disaster, and thus became indirectly responsible for that shipmate, Herman Melville, being inspired to write MOBY DICK...ls, the crews makeup, including their respective duties and the system of remuneration, their navigational tools, and the graphic details of converting those floating oil deposits into big bucks for the shipowners.

The experts from whom I was to learn that day were Michael Cart and Richard Jackson.  Between them, they made several points that have stuck with me as I define and evaluate young adult literature.  Among the words of wisdom that day were:<br />Adolescents create and re-create themselves on a daily basis as they search for their identity. Good teen literature frequently provides characters whose roles teen readers can try on vicariously as if they were  cloaks.  Good teen literature frequently poses more questions than it provides answers.<br />That day's presentations were the inspiration for my creating a separate young adult section--after a week of quoting the experts I was given the okay to purchase and shelve those books away from the kids' stuff, in the process becoming the \\"children's and young adult\\" buyer.  This division, of course, is the rule rather than the exception in bookstores and libraries today.<br />STONER AND SPAZ, set in LA, is the latest, perfect example of what young adult fiction is all about.<br />In addition, STONER AND SPAZ is a book that pays homage to film the way SEEK does to radio.<br />Ben (Spaz) Bancroft, a teen \\"cinefile\\" whose aloofness is the result of his self-consciousness over his dragging an arm and a leg due to cerebral palsy, tells us the story of his entanglement with Colleen (Stoner) Minou, who is as engaging, witty, and tough as Mona Lisa Vito, Marisa Tomei's character in My Cousin Vinnie.  Colleen's boyfriend, Ed, is studying to be a drug lord.  Early on, as Ben waits to hand over the report on THE GREAT GATSBY for which Colleen has hit him up, he gives us a look at Ed in action:<br />\\"Waiting there I feel, I don't know anthropological, I guess.  I just need a pair of binoculars and a field guide to watch Ed Dorn in his black jeans and black T-shirt make the rounds, moving from the gangstas in their huge pants through the Mexican tough guys and into the Asian kung-fu fighters.  Each clique has a different handshake, and Ed knows them all.  He knows which girl's hand to grab and rub over his shaved head, which brother to joke with, which guy's Pepsi to snatch and take a sip of, which one to lean into and whisper.  Colleen walks a few steps behind.  She wears knee-high silver boots and looks like someone from a different galaxy.\\"<br />When Colleen catches up with Ben, he mentions to her:<br />\\"'I was watching Ed in action.  He's like Louis the Fourteenth,' I said, 'moving through the gardens at Versailles dispensing favors.'\\"<br />\\"'Louis better watch his ass,' says Colleen.  'This is Ed's turf.'\\"<br />Ben has been raised by his grandmother, who dresses him in prep garb and who meets Colleen when she invites herself for a ride home in Grandma's Cadillac and then endears herself to Grandma by immediately puking out the window.  Ben has never given Grandma a bit of trouble before.  She cannot understand his growing involvement with Colleen:<br />\\"'What is it exactly that you see in her?

She thinks for a few seconds.  \\"So badly decorated.'\\"<br />What Ben sees in Colleen is that she treats his condition so honestly and matter-of-factly.  In turn, he makes her feel like a high school kid, which is in such contrast to the scary world of drugs, clubs, and thugs in which she's immersed.  And while this is a uniquely descriptive and extremely fun story, it is no fairy tale.  When it's over we're left heavy on the side of unanswered questions.

I'm curled up in front of my computer at 6:30 A.M., marshaling my thoughts about nuclear power--a topic which monopolized my life for several years during the late 1970s--and I'm wondering how I can locate a copy of Amory Lovins' seminal essay on energy in the October 1976 issue of Foreign Affairs. Turns out it takes just five little key-steps from my library's homepage ..., and I am able to view a pdf file of the 32 page article! I utilized that article, \\"Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken,\\" back then as the foundation to my own argument--that the electricity from the twin nuclear power plants, then proposed for eastern Long Island, was unnecessary.<br />If our years of protests and legal intervention hadn't already killed plans for constructing those twin nuclear plants, they were officially pronounced dead after the nation spent a scary few days awaiting the outcome of events in Middletown, Pennsylvania.<br />MELTDOWN: A RACE AGAINST NUCLEAR DISASTER AT THREE MILE ISLAND, by Wilborn Hampton, is a great introduction for young adults about what it's like to be a journalist. More importantly, it's a chronicle by a journalist on the scene of the events at Three Mile Island in the spring of 1979, where we got lucky--a catastrophe that would far outweigh that of 9-11 was narrowly averted. A full understanding of the extent of that potential disaster can only be grasped when viewed in relation to the 1986 nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl, which is the subject of MELTDOWN's final chapter:<br />\\"There is no official death toll for Chernobyl. At the time, the Soviet government reported that 31 people died in the accident. But since the breakup of the Soviet Union, more honest assessments of the extent of the tragedy have come out. The Ukraine, which is now an independent nation, has aid that more than 4,300 people died there. Nearly all the firemen who battled the blaze that first night are now dead, most from cancer or other radiation-related illnesses...Deaths among the soldiers and workers who built the concrete shell around the [damaged and contaminated] reactor are estimated to number at least 6,000...<br />\\"The land around the Chernobyl plant is a wasteland. Ukrainian officials say that 160,000 square kilometers [approximately 62,000 square miles] were contaminated with radioactive fallout at a level forty times greater than the level of radiation that Hiroshima or Nagasaki received from the first atomic bombs...Pripyat is now a ghost town...Bulldozers have buried most of the houses, and the old apartment blocks are deserted, the possessions of the former inhabitants too radioactive to reclaim...<br />\\"In Gomel, a town about sixty miles north of Chernobyl that received perhaps the heaviest concentration of radioactive fallout, the local orphanage is full of infants and young children as a result of what has become an epidemic of birth defects now being born to women who received large doses of radiation.\\"<br />A young adult reading such awful facts and considering the root causes of why such potentially catastrophic technology is \\"necessary\\" may well be a young adult who, at the very least, decides to turn off their light the next time they leave the room.<br />Furthermore, MELTDOWN provides a comprehensible introduction to nuclear power for the young adults who are growing up facing the world's aging inventory of nuclear power plants--and the ever-increasing quantities of highly radioactive nuclear waste from those power plants (which has been a hot topic just this past week).<br />Common sense dictates that many of these plants will need to be abandoned in the not-so-distant future. Face it: it's one thing for me to keep my 1980 Datsun station wagon on the road, but I can afford to have something break down on it. (Actually that thought makes me a bit nervous.) We expect someone to be watching out for us when it comes to such things as geriatric commercial airliners. But who is going to going tomake the decisions regarding the antiquated nuclear plants that currently produce such a significant portion of our nation's electric supply? MELTDOWN gives young adults a head start on considering this dilemma.<br />Its readability and the significance of the subject matter, combined with a fine glossary and a list of recommended resources, make MELTDOWN: A RACE AGAINST NUCLEAR DISASTER AT THREE MILE ISLAND a must-have. It provides today's young adults an opportunity for examining a pivotal episode from our energy past and an incentive for contemplating their energy future...oing to make the decisions regarding the antiquated nuclear plants that currently produce such a significant portion of our nation's electric supply?

More recently, there have been sacred texts of major religions, along with the likes of Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Ernest Thayer, Clement Clarke Moore, Bob Dylan, and Ani DiFranco.  Verse is the genesis of literature.  The language of verse is so appealing that the works of these poets has endured for hundreds or thousands of years.<br />Nevertheless, if there were verse novels when I was a kid, it was a secret to me.  It has been in the last dozen years that the genre has really taken off, with exceptional works by Karen Hesse, Mel Glenn, Sonya Sones, Virginia Euwer Wolff, Ron Koertge, and Ann Turner, among others.<br />Great verse novels are typically filled with wonderful language.  I love how the form permits an author to incorporate this language into a sophisticated story while paring the words to a minimum.  How each poem in the book can present a complete, unique, little picture.  How the form allows authors to present the perspectives of multiple characters in a single book.<br />Such is the case with JINX, a gem of a verse novel, written by Australian author Margaret Wild.  JINX is the name Jen gives herself when her teenage world comes completely unglued.  We get to see and hear from Jen, as well as friends, parents, and stepparents, as they all try to find their way.<br />jen's mom will write<br />Jen's mom writes advertising copy.<br />She specializes in white goods:<br />washing machines, dryers, fridges,<br />freezers, dishwashers.<br />She hates these appliances<br />hulking<br />in corners,<br />power-hungry and fractious.<br />One day, she will have a wood stove,<br />and she'll write about things that matter--<br />she will write about birth and death,<br />about love and the absence of love,<br />about fathers and children,<br />about mothers and daughters,<br />about lovers and friends.<br />She'll write about the whole goddamn<br />wonderful, awful business<br />of loving and being loved.<br />One of the most intriguing characters of the book is Grace, Jen's sister whose Down's syndrome was detected early enough that her mom had the option of terminating the pregnancy.

Her boyfriend is a member of the fish frat--\\"that's the sons of Hackett's commercial fishermen, who are sometimes lifeguards and usually very hunky.\\" Her friends think she should be happy, set in her position among the high school elite, healthy after missing most of junior high due to treatments for acute juvenile leukemia.<br />But Claire, who still has her share of problems, sees the neatly folded boxes of her life crumble when she becomes friends with Lani.

I never imagined that I'd get to share old stories that involved reading Joyce Carol Oates...or that I'd be characterizing a book of hers as one of this year's YA highlights.<br />But, here I am!<br />I first encountered the writing of Joyce Carol Oates in 1973 as a freshman at the University of Connecticut.  I experienced two semesters of freshman comp with a beautiful and demanding grad student named Ann Gates.  The nearly book-a-week regimen imposed by Ann took us careening through a collection of titles based on a theme she called, \\"The American Dream.\\"  Included were ON THE ROAD, GATSBY, FEAR & LOATHING, LOLITA, SANCTUARY, SNOW WHITE, TROUT FISHING, and Oates' WONDERLAND.  Ann, who tried to teach us how to find the OTHER meanings in the authors' words, was frequently assisted in class by her musician-husband, David, whose specialty was turning us on to old vinyl recordings by 'Bird and 'Train, along with illuminating the latest examples of phallic imagery in what we'd been reading.<br />It was the end of that second semester of being in her class when, as I sat on the library floor cramming for some final or other, Ann literally came floating down the hall, her face all lit up.  She paused long enough to tell me that The New Yorker had bought her short story, \\"A Platonic Relationship.\\"  It was published later that year under her own (soon to be well-known) name, Ann Beattie.  Her later-to-be musician-ex-husband, David Gates, ended up working for Newsweek and writing his own books, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist, JERNIGAN.<br />Anyway, thirty years past WONDERLAND, Joyce Carol Oates has discovered her true calling--young adult fiction.  BIG MOUTH & UGLY GIRL, a book I devoured excitedly in one sitting, is a masterfully written and thought-provoking gem that is sure to bring Oates a whole new generation of fans.<br />There's Matt (THE MOUTH):<br />\\"At the rear of the room, Matt and his friends were absorbed in the play, for which Matt was doing hurried revisions, typing away furiously on his laptop.  Anxiously he'd ask his friends 'But does this work?  Is it scary, is it funny, does it move?'  Matt Donaghy had something of a reputation at Rocky River for being being both brainy and a comic character, but secretly he was a perfectionist, too.  He'd been working on his one-act play William Wilson: A Case of Mistaken Identity longer than his friends knew, and he had hopes it would be selected to be performed at the school's Spring Arts Festival.\\"<br />Those \\"friends\\" all abandon Matt in an instant after he is dragged from the classroom by detectives who have been tipped off that Matt has threatened to blow up the school.<br />There's Ursula (UGLY GIRL):<br />\\"Strange: how stuff that used to bother me in middle school, had the power to make me hide away and cry, didn't bother me at all now.  Since that day I woke up and knew I wasn't an ugly girl, I was Ugly Girl...\\"<br />\\"Lots of people I was starting to hate who I used to like a lot.  But when you like people, you can be hurt.  I'd made a few mistakes with girl friends, and one or two guys I'd thought were my buddies, and I wouldn't make these mistakes again...\\"<br />\\"I could see that my teachers didn't know what to make of me.  There was Ursula Riggs, who was an excellent student, a serious girl with an interest in biology and art, and there was Ugly Girl, who played sports like a Comanche and who had a sullen, sarcastic tongue.  It was Ugly Girl who was susceptible to 'moods'--these ranged from Inky Black to Fiery Red.  In a mood sometimes I'd walk out of class, yawning; or I might quit a test in the middle, just snatch up my backpack and exit.  My grades were everything from A+ to F.  In a rational frame of mind I knew I had to worry I'd screw up my SAT's and not get into a college of the caliber I could bear going to, but in the next minute I'd shrug and laugh.  Who cares?  Not Ugly Girl, warrior-woman.\\"<br />Ursula is not a friend of Matt's but she's knownhim since fifth grade.  She also knows the truth of what Matt has actually said about blowing up the school.  BIG MOUTH & UGLY GIRL is the story of what happens when Ugly Girl indignantly steps forward to set the record straight.<br />Ursula informs us: \\"Life consists of Facts, and Facts are of two kids: Boring and Crucial.  I figured this out for myself in eighth grade.  Wish I could patent it!  A Boring Fact is virtually any fact that doesn't concern you.  Or it's just trivial, a nothing fact.  (Like the annual rainfall in, let's say, Bolivia.  Crucial to the Bolivians, but Boring to everyone else.)  I know the Crucial Facts of Ugly Girl's life are Boring Facts to others.  Yet, to Ugly Girl, they are Crucial.  There's one test of a Crucial Fact: It hurts.\\"<br />Crucial Fact: BIG MOUTH AND UGLY GIRL is a must-read.

Two weeks ago, just before I left for BookExpo, one of the students asked me:<br />\\"It seems that you like reading very much, maybe you can share with us why do you enjoy it so much? I really would like to know.\\"<br />The beginning of my response was:<br />\\"A great book can take me off to a different world or bring me closer to this one. Frequently a great book will grab me by the throat and slam me against the wall...\\"<br />FEED, the latest book by M.T. Anderson, did all of those things to me--and more.  In fact, at the moment it feels as if my nose is pulverized and askew and that the skin covering my shoulder blades scraped away when I slid down that wall and landed hard on my bottom.<br />I woke up long before dawn--from a mildly bad dream related to a part of the story I read last night--and quietly slipped out to my desk to finish the rest of the book.<br />FEED is a dark, futuristic satire.  It's a tale both intense and extreme that pokes fun at our disposible, consumeristic society, at our communications revolution, at the increasing role of corporations in our education systems, and at the diminished vocabulary skills among those people who consistantly resort to a particular four-letter word as the adjective of choice in any given situation.<br />You may not enjoy reading a book that spews like a rapper or slams into you as if you've taken a left turn into a mosh pit, but the profound messages in FEED clearly make it the cautionary tale of the year.<br />The story begins on the Moon, where Titus and his friends have gone for spring break.  He and his buddies all have Feed, which is an online computer implant typically installed shortly after birth.  Feed constantly bombards the characters with information and banners, much of which has to do with the latest fashions, upcars, and music.  It also provides them with Chat--the capacity to mentally instant message each other.<br />\\"...I was playing with the magnets on my boots and trying not to look at her.  I didn't want her to feel my eyes before I made my move.  I was careful.  Quendy and Loga went off to the bathroom because hairstyles had changed.<br />Marty drifted around and made slit-eyes at Link.  Link and I were chatting about the girl, like  I was going,She is meg youch,and he was going, What the hell's she wearing?, and I was going, Wool.  It's wool. Like from an animal,and then Calista did her own chat to us, which was,If you want to hear about an animal, what about two guys staring with their mouths wide open so they look completely Cro-Magnon?...\\"<br />So Titus gets to meet the girl, Violet, but shortly thereafter they and most of his friends have their Feeds hacked by a wild old white-haired guy on the dance floor...<br />This vision of our future planet is one you don't want to miss.  I've never seen or read the original story of Titus (Andronicus--Shakespeare tragedy), but its characterization as symbolization of \\"the essential absurdity of modern life\\" certainly fits Anderson's frightening tale of corporate power and a used-up planet.

And what has Kublai Kahn got to do with this historic adventure story that poses the question to teenagers--What if you are taught to always obey your relatives and those relatives make the Dursleys look like Ozzy and Harriet?<br />Haoyou is the boy living this nightmare, adrift in a sea of tradition, obedience, and superstition, who takes the daring gamble of offering himself as a wind tester:<br />\\"...Again the crew tugged on the rope, to tilt it back into the face of the wind.  Haoyou's head cracked against the matting, and the rope handles burned the skin off his palms.  He could hear the fibers of the rope creaking under the strain, his ribs bending inward where the harness crossed his chest.  Perhaps his kite would burst apart.  Perhaps there would be no air at all to breathe at the top of the sky\\"<br />The key to this riveting story set in thirteenth century Cathay (China) is a strong, cunning, heroic female character--a distant relative named Mipeng.  I was continually touched and astounded by her bravery and intelligence as well as her friendship and support of Haoyou.  She is fiercely determined to strip that blindfold of obedience from his eyes.<br />\\"And all at once, as if fear were a cloud layer through which he had risen, Haoyou looked about him and saw the whole world beneath him. And it was his.  Like a sliver shield daubed with blue and green, it throbbed, convex, complex, beautiful.  He was a swimmer floating on the surface of an ocean, borne up by such a clarity of water that he could see each sunken treasure, each darting fish, each twist of coral down there in the unbreathing fathoms below.  He, out of all its sluggish inhabitants, could breathe!  He alone had mastery over this shining province so beautiful that it spangled red and black and green in front of his eyes.\\"<br />It is also fascinating to get such a vivid taste, vision, and smell of the Cathay encountered by Marco Polo--from the grimy, oily seaside villages to the opulence of the aforementioned Mongol conqueror.<br />And it's a rare adventure story that could top that feeling McCaughrean gives us in THE KITE RIDER--of flying hundreds of feet in the air, over a land of long ago, anchored to Mother Earth by a kitestring.it spangled red and black and green in front of his eyes.\\" <br />It is also fascinating to get such a vivid taste, vision, and smell of the Cathay encountered by Marco Polo--from the grimy, oily seaside villages to the opulence of the aforementioned Mongol conqueror. <br />And it's a rare adventure story that could top that feeling McCaughrean gives us in THE KITE RIDER--of flying hundreds of feet in the air, over a land of long ago, anchored to Mother Earth by a kitestring.	2002-10-08

The seven glimpses we are given of Dolores--set chronologically between the ages of seven and sixteen--provide a brief-yet-vivid portrait of a girl who is growing up strong, who is comfortable with who she is, and who is an absolute joy to know.<br />Dolores's growth, from the seven year old who is able to gain the admiration and respect of her big brother's teenage friends, to a teenager herself--ready and able to face down the fiercest threats flung her way, is accomplished with the ever-present support of that big brother, Jimmy.  The most poignant scenes in the book are those in which Jimmy is there, time and again, to guard her from harm, to converse with her at the crack of dawn, or to smile and wave at her from up in the bleachers.<br />\\"They heard the sound of things being scraped onto plates.  Twice.<br />'Now the music will go up,' said Dolores.<br />The music went up.  It was jazz piano.<br />Footsteps came down the hall.<br />'You think he likes all this?' Jimmy asked, in spite of himself.<br />Jimmy heard a rustling in Dolores's bed as the footsteps drew near the door.<br />'I think he likesus,' whispered Dolores.  'Now, pretend you're asleep! It's the least we can do.'<br />Jimmy closed his eyes and lay still.  The room was quiet as the door opened.\\"<br />Dolores, a girl who has learned how to slice through all of the popularity nonsense, how to wield a hot hockey stick, and who also plays a mean electric guitar, is a girl you've gotta meet ...	2002-10-08

It's like watching a movie but you are the movie. And you're watching yourself talk and walk, but the whole time you're holding your breath and thinking, What is she going to do next? ...<br />\\"Scary\\" and \\"exciting\\" were the adjectives my ten-year-old son, Alex, used in explaining to me why he's read 100+ pages each of the past two days--... The book that's got him totally enthralled is HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY AND NEVER BE FOUND. I have to agree with Alex: from the book's opening moments--narrated by twelve-year-old Margaret--we are dropped squarely into an exciting and suspenseful tale:<br />\\"Most stories start at the beginning, but I really can't say I know where that is. Is it a falling-down mansion on a small island in the Pacific Northwest, or in the navy blue pickup truck making its way to that mansion? Does it start on a sunny day this year, or on a sunny day twenty years before? Is it with me, or with a young boy who, a long, long time ago, believed he was turning into a rat? I guess the only thing I really do know is where it started for me--in that navy blue pickup heading toward a place I didn't know existed. A place that had already changed my life.\\"<br />The illustrations are an innovative and integral part of the book. They are snippets of Ratt, a comic series for which there is only one hand-drawn copy per issue. Those issues of Ratt appear regularly and mysteriously at the Island's library--a rather unique institution that carries only unpublished manuscripts, apparently all submitted by the Island's residents:<br />\\"Under D was not one novel by Dickens. H had no Hawthorne and F had no Frost. There was no Hemingway or Fitzgerald, no Eliot or Kuo. Instead they found stack after stack of handmade books. Some were typed, some were scribbled, some were printed out on cheap computer paper, some were stapled, some had brads, some were held together with twine.<br />\\" 'The unpublished works of Everyman,' exclaimed Mr. Librarian proudly. 'Everywoman and Everykid, too.' \\"<br />Boyd, the boy who lives next to that eerie mansion, has long been the devoted fan of Ratt. He and Margaret, who arrives in her mother's navy blue pickup, and the comic book series with a life of its own become entangled in the mysteries of the mansion and of the death of Margaret's father four years earlier. They are surrounded by quirky characters such as Mr. Librarian, Margaret's funny and exasperating little sister Sophie, and their mom, who has been barely coping since her husband's disappearance.<br />HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY AND NEVER BE FOUND is a haunting and fun find for middle grade readers.<br />..., some were stapled, some had brads, some were held together with twine. <br />\\" 'The unpublished works of Everyman,' exclaimed Mr. Librarian proudly.

(This is, in fact, his fiftieth book.)  CRISPIN is set in 1300s England.  Not only is the story steeped in the history of feudalistic medieval Britain, but Avi brings that history to life most vividly without ever once hitting you over the head with it.<br />\\"Time was the great millstone, which ground us to dust like kerneled wheat.  The Holy Church told us where we were in the alterations of the day, the year, and in our daily toil.  Birth and death alone gave distinction to our lives, as we made the journey between the darkness from whence we had come to the darkness where we were fated to await Judgment Day.\\"<br />CRISPIN is the name of the 13-year-old peasant main character; although, the only name he's known for himself is \\"Asta's Son.\\"  That is until his mother dies, and in his blinding grief he stumbles upon a secret meeting in the woods between John Aycliffe--the steward of the manor--and a wealthy stranger.  In a flash he finds himself the target of a plot in which he is falsely accused of a theft and declared a \\"wolf's head,\\" allowing anyone to kill him on sight.  On his way \\"out of town\\" the village priest tells the boy his real name, tells him to hide out for 24 hours until he can round up some provisions, and promises to reveal some more vital information the next day.  Then the priest proceeds to get his throat slit and Crispin is on the run with the theft AND the priest's murder hanging over him.  What happens to him is one of those stories that is so well crafted that you can taste and smell the settings, as well as hear the sinister growl in Aycliffe's throat, as you anxiously wait for something to go right for Crispin.<br />While trying not to reveal any more of the story, I'll also tell you that there is a character in here who I find darn near as lovable as Hagrid.<br />I hope that Avi is contemplating a sequel to this one--the end came way too soon for me.<br />Richie Partington<br />[...]<br />BudNotBuddy@aol.comhis one--the end came way too soon for me. <br />Richie Partington<BR>[...]<BR>BudNotBuddy@aol.com	2002-10-03

I cut it out of a magazine for homework when I was six years old. 'Look for words that begin with W,' my teacher, Mrs. Evans, had said.<br />\\"She was the one who marked in the X, spoiling my picture. She pointed. ' This is a picture of a family, Hollis. A mother, M, a father, F, a brother, B, a sister, S. They're standing in front of their house, H. I don't see one W word here, young lady.'<br />\\"I opened my mouth to say: How about W for wish, or W for want, or W for 'Wouldn't it be loverly,' like the song the music teacher had taught us?<br />\\"But Mrs. Evans was at the next table by that time, shushing me over her shoulder.\\"<br />PICTURES OF HOLLIS WOODS is one of this year's most beautiful and most well-crafted tales. With the piles of new books I have waiting for me to read, it is rare for me to read a book twice, no less twice in successive days. But that's how strongly this one has affected me.<br />\\"...'Drawing is what you see of the world, truly see.'<br />\\" 'Yes, maybe,' I said, not sure what she meant.<br />\\" 'And sometimes what you see is so deep in your head you're not even sure of what you're seeing. But when it's down there on paper, and you look at it, really look, you'll see the way things are...' \\"<br />Hollis Woods is an artistic foster child whose troubled past has been marked by a succession of stops:<br />\\"There was the green house where the door didn't quite close; the wind blew in and up the stairs, rattling the window panes. The white house: crumbs on the table, kids fighting over a bag of Wonder bread. The yellow house: sooty, a long-haired woman with braids, no rugs on the stairs, the loud sound of feet going up and down...\\"<br />But Hollis Woods dreams of having a family. And she nearly got her wish thanks to the Regans--the Old Man, Izzie, and Steven--who had taken her in for a summer in Upstate New York.<br />Then something destroyed that perfect picture, and Hollis, who has now been placed in the home of the beautiful, old artist, Josie Cahill, is trying to come to terms with what happened last summer...and trying to deal with the secret of why Josie might have to be taken away from her, too.<br />\\"I frowned. 'Look at a picture one way and you'll see one thing,' I said. 'Look again and you might see something else. That's what the Old Man...' I shook my head. 'A friend of mine said that once.'<br />\\" 'Ah, yes,' Beatrice said, sketching in an eye, bushy eyebrows, sharp lashes as she spoke. 'But that's the world, isn't it? You have to keep looking to find the truth.' \\"<br />PICTURES OF HOLLIS WOODS is a poignant story of family and how those without traditional families frequently fall prey to The System. It includes the mystery about the summer's tragedy, and a love story about water. The author, who grew up around the corner from my Dad's family in Queens and not far from the community of Hollis Woods, sketches vivid landscapes of the woods and the water--the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware River. Both simple and deceptively complex, this book could be taught to high school students as well as older grade school kids.<br />Patricia Reilly Giff also fills her canvas with some of the most memorable people you'll ever meet, and who you'll certainly want to stay in touch with long after finishing the book. In fact, I'm not near ready to put this book down--it promises to be my first Lunchtime Read Aloud, once school resumes in September.<br />Richie Partington<br />[...]<br />BudNotBuddy@aol.comthing destroyed that perfect picture, and Hollis, who has now been placed in the home of the beautiful, old artist, Josie Cahill, is trying to come to terms with what happened last summer...and trying to deal with the secret of why Josie might have to be taken away from her, too. <br />\\"I frowned.

As I write this, I'm perched upon the royal blue carpeting between two of the dividers that stretch the length of a football field and herd us slowly in the direction of Jean Auel.  Jean is sitting on a stool behind a table just beyond the goal line.  I arrived here at the Javits Convention Center around 6:15 this morning--that's 3:15 A.M. California time, my body reminds me--in order to obtain one of the relatively limited tickets that allow entrance to this line for the purpose of receiving a smile and a signed copy of the new book from Ms. Auel.  David Halberstam's line will be my next stop.  But at the moment I am feeling like my best literary score of the day is the additional advance copy of HOOT that my friends at Random House are graciously permitting me to take back to California.  Now, I can lend out a copy (first to my faithful webmaster) and keep another to eventually put away in my collection of the really good ones.<br />Yes, HOOT is one that you'll want for your collection, too.<br />I was just about to say that I can't wait to get home and start reading HOOT to my kids and Shari, but that wouldn't be particularly true.  Thanks to another publisher friend, I am going to see Dee Dee Ramone and the Tom Tom Club perform at a party tonight, so frankly I CAN wait a little while to get back to California.  But when I DO get there, you can be sure that I'm immediately sitting everyone down to share this great tale.<br />First, you have the owls:<br />\\"Walking back toward the patrol car, the policeman stumbled and fell down.  Curley grabbed him under one arm and hoisted him to his feet.<br />'Stupid owls,' said Curley.<br />The policeman brushed the dirt and grass burrs off his uniform.  'You say owls?'<br />Curley gestured at a hole in the ground.  It was as big around as one of Mother Paula's famous buttermilk flapjacks.  A mound of loose white sand was visible at the entrance.<br />'That's what you tripped over,' Curley informed Officer Delinko.<br />'An owl lives down there?'  The policeman bent down and studied the hole.  'How big are they?'<br />''Bout as tall as a beer can.'<br />'No kidding?' said Officer Delinko.<br />'But I ain't never seen one, officially speakin.'\\"<br />Then, you've got the bully:<br />\\"The grip on his throat tightened.  He felt Dana's ashtray breath on his right ear: 'How come you ain't got your boots on today?  Who ever heard of a cowgirl wearing Air Jordans?'<br />'They're Rebocks,' Roy squeaked.\\"<br />Now, throw in the mystery kid (whose first appearances are reminiscent of Maniac Magee):<br />\\"The boy was straw-blond and wiry, and his skin was nut-brown from the sun.  The expression on his face was intent and serious.  He wore a faded Miami Heat basketball jersey and dirty khaki shorts, and here was the odd part: no shoes.  The soles of his bare feet looked as black as barbecue coals...Because the boy kept running--past the corner, past the line of students waiting to get on the bus; past the bus itself.  Roy wanted to shout, 'Hey look at that guy!' but his mouth wasn't working so well.  Dana Matherson still had him from behind, pushing his face against the window.\\"<br />Add in the seriously evil PR guy from the pancake house chain, the tough girl soccer star, the assortment of parents with widely varying skill levels, and the bumbling young cop.  Then drop Roy, the new kid in town, into the middle of everything and you have the recipe for a book that will enchant kids of all ages.  There is humor, sadness, and a touch of suspense.<br />What WILL happen to the owls in those holes?<br />In HOOT, Carl Hiaasen does an incredible job of showing the different styles of activism that different people resort to.  He presents the reader with the contemporary clash of free enterprise versus global ecological issues.  He has a lot to say between the lines about parenting, and he has some great insights into the methods of dealing with bullies.<br />I've never read his adult books, but I sure hope Hiaasen writes more children's books for my kids.

Mom had gotten everything together so that when Dad got home from work we immediately piled into our black Rambler station wagon and headed off for Crab Meadow Beach on Long Island Sound. Mom watched over us as we charged into the water--particularly seven-year-old novice swimmer Jimmy--while Dad filled the hibachi with charcoal briquettes and lit it. After dinner we took one last swim as the sun dipped below the horizon. Dad buried the remains of the glowing charcoal in the sand. After drying off, I started down to the water's edge to rinse the sand off of my feet before putting on my sneakers.<br />I didn't make it there. Pain ripped through me like a lightning bolt. A two inch square blister--colored white and brown--rose on the sole of my foot. I had stepped upon an errant briquette that hadn't been buried deep enough. That pain was something I'd never known the equal of. I ended up barefoot for a week, reading, my foot up on a hassock.<br />You know those firewalks--where people step barefoot on hot coals? They were really big out here in the '80s. In a million years you couldn't convince me that I could do that! And based on my memory of that relatively minor burn sustained as a kid, my mind cannot begin to comprehend the pain that serious burn victims endure. People die from that kind of trauma.<br />Dayle, the main character of OUT OF THE FIRE by Debroah Froese, is a burn victim who lives but has to fight to survive the trauma that nearly killed her:<br />\\"Time for her basin bath. That's what Cora had told Mom. It made it sound so simple. Close to pleasant, even. But the basin bath brought sharp, steely tools that scraped dead flesh from my body. Morphine distorted the torture but I still knew it for what it was. Debriding. Humiliating and painful, all in the name of therapy.<br />\\"And while my flesh was being raked, other gowned people bent and twisted my limbs. They told me the treatment was supposed to keep me limber and prevent the scars of healing from binding me into a tight cocoon. But at that moment I wanted to curl up into a tight cocoon and die, or at least sink so low beneath the surface of the earth that no one would find me.\\"<br />Surviving a life-threatening burn, especially if your face is involved, means having to eventually deal with the way people look at you. So many times in young adult books--as with real life--young people deal with issues of body image and appearance. My eleven-year-old, Rosemary, tells me quite earnestly that virtually all children her age are extremely concerned with the way they look and the way they dress. (She backed down from her original position that 100 percent of the children her age care, allowing for a few \\"far-fetched\\" examples I concocted). But with whom you hang, what you wear, and what you look like are the basis for so many adolescents deciding who you are. And what Dayle faces in terms of appearance is in another league compared to most kids.<br />In fact, Dayle is a girl who has stepped forth from a cocoon not so long before the horriffic accident. A quiet student, she had gotten up the guts to participate in the school play, and had thereby caught the eye of an extremely popular boy. Dayle even has images of someday modeling. Or had. Unfortunately, as was the case in Cynthia Voight's classic IZZY WILLY NILLY, Dayle's boyfriend Kevin is part of a drinking crowd. Alcohol plays a central role in Dayle's accident, as it did in Izzy's.<br />OUT OF THE FIRE is a story that might make kids who are fussing about being a little too heavy or pimply or not having exactly the \\"right\\" wardrobe think twice about the \\"problems\\" they're facing. Even the character in IZZY WILLY-NILLY--a girl who has lost a leg in an accident--would have to pause to consider how bad things are for Dayle.<br />Hopefully, as with IZZY, teen readers will also consider the alcohol issue. (I'm always telling my children and students how I was one of thelucky fifty percent--that there was a fifty-fifty chance that I could have killed myself or someone else as a result of those many \\"celebrations\\" of my younger years).<br />In OUT OF THE FIRE, Dayle gets a real perspective on the value of family and true friends...and that there's more to life than just the way you look.<br />\\"And as Stu pointed out, scars were a mark of experience.\\"...of the lucky fifty percent--that there was a fifty-fifty chance that I could have killed myself or someone else as a result of those many \\"celebrations\\" of my younger years). <br />In OUT OF THE FIRE, Dayle gets a real perspective on the value of family and true friends...and that there's more to life than just the way you look. <br />\\"And as Stu pointed out, scars were a mark of experience.\\"...	2002-10-03

He always said 'Gather round' to start it off. Squid was six or seven.<br />\\"Hannah, Squid, and Alastair sat on the rocks as sharp as nails. 'This is the byssus,' said Murray, spreading with his fingers the cottony threads that held the mussel to its rock. 'It's spun by a gland in the animal's foot. He lashes himself in place like Ulysses to his mast.' \\"He turned the shell in his hand. It was a California mussel, nearly eight inches long. He pointed out the scars along the shell, like patches of white on its deep purple back. 'This fellow,' he said, 'has had some sort of an accident. He might have been wacked by a log.' The scars were deep, and Murray picked at the grooves with his nails. 'The poor brute almost bought it there. Must have got the fright of his life.'<br />\\" 'How old is he?' asked Alistair.<br />\\" 'Hard to say.' Murray bounced the mussel in his palm. 'He's an old-timer, all right. They grow like weeds in the beginning; more than three inches the first year. But then they slow down, and this one's lived on the island maybe as long as I have.' \\"<br />Imagine being Murray and Hannah's kid: growing up on an island, learning how to swim before you walk, working with your parents for a few hours in the morning, and then having the rest of the day for exploring, reading, playing, dreaming, and listening to your father rhapsodize about the mysteries of the plant and animal kingdoms around you. Hop into a glass-bottomed rowboat he's built, paddle out into the water as you observe the creatures below, and then stow the oars as whales breach and blow alongside you.<br />Hungry? Need a new book? Don't worry! Supply ships come by the island every month so that you've got plenty of food, fuel, supplies, clothes, and books to read.<br />There is a downside, however.<br />Throughout the years of growing up, the only human contact that you have outside of your parents and sibling are those monthly supply ships and the voices of the other lightkeepers over the radio system, reporting the weathers every few hours.<br />THE LIGHTKEEPER'S DAUGHTER is the story of Squid (Elizabeth) and Alistair growing up on remote Lizzie Island, off the coast of British Columbia. It is told looking back, four years after Alistair had drowned, when seventeen year-old Squid brings her three year-old daughter to the island for the first time. It is a mysterious and taut tale about what went so terribly wrong with their idyllic existence on the island.<br />\\" 'Humpbacks sing,' said Murray. 'Did you know that?'<br />\\"She shook her head.<br />\\" 'Each year one of them starts a song. Then others pick it up; they lengthen it and change it.' He spoke softly--he always did--looking out to sea and not at her. 'By the middle of summer they all know the song. They sing in a chorus over hundreds of miles.'<br />\\"She leaned her head against his shoulder. She could feel him breathing, and she tried to do what the whales were doing, and time her breath to his.<br />\\" 'No one knew,' said Murray. 'Until the war. Then someone put a microphone in the water, hoping to hear submarines. They heard this singing instead. And they didn't know what the hell it was.' \\"She pressed herself against him. She was shivering, but he didn't notice.<br />\\" 'I don't understand it,' he said.<br />\\" 'The song?' she asked.<br />\\"He shook his head. 'Och, we'll never understand that. I mean how men could kill them.'<br />\\" 'No,' she said.'<br />\\"He sighed. 'They're wonderful things, whales are. They're miraculous.' \\"<br />This is a story that is haunting and bittersweet, a setting that is utterly entrancing. Murray has no use for civilization--he hasn't been off of the island since leaving school and taking over from the last lightkeeper. Hannah washed up on the shore a couple of decades after Murray arrived. The kids soon followed. Bit by bit the two children and their mother reveal the secrets of their lives with Murray, a barnacle of a man who has a life or death grip on the island.
