When it comes to business and management books, there is a typology that categorizes much of the writing in this genre into two: by thinkers who can't do and by doers who can't think! This underlines the fact that academic analysis, by itself and without practical relevance, achieves very little. Similarly, so-called practical recipes for success with a narrow focus and little real understanding of the underlying principles also leave much to be desired.<br />Therefore, when a book that makes an important contribution to the understanding of an increasingly competitive global economy such as BOOM makes the scene, it is to be welcomed as a breath of fresh air. Written by two authors with strong credentials who are themselves in the midst of building a multinational enterprise, this book speaks with a certain air of authority and credibility. Frank Vogl was born in London and educated at Leeds. A former Reuters reporter and European business correspondent of The Times, he moved to the USA to become US economics correspondent for The Times and then director of information and public affairs at the World Bank. He is now a director of Sutton Resources Ltd of Canada, of which James Sinclair is a fellow director and chairman. Sinclair is an authority on investment and financial markets and was formerly head of a leading Wall Street precious metals trading firm. His previous books include The Strategic Metals War and How to Make Money in Gold Currencies.<br />In Part One, BOOM and the New Industrial Revolution, authors Vogl and Sinclair forecast dramatic changes in the global economy, with an unprecedented era of growth providing extraordinary opportunities for business: hence the 'boom' scenario. The authors see this new era of economic growth unfolding in most of the countries of the world gathering momentum as we enter the 21st century. As a natural consequence of the new industrial revolution taking place in emerging economies, hundreds of millions of people, if not billions, will benefit and rise from poverty to form the new middle classes of Asia, particularly in China and India, and concurrently in Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe. Supplying the customer demands in this emerging market and building the infrastructure for these economies, say Vogl and Sinclair, represent outstanding business opportunities not to be missed. The boom is stimulated by the steady growth and low-inflation policies now being seen in leading industrialised countries as well as by economic policies in dozens of emerging market economies that encourage investment, savings, and price stability. These economic policies are supported by social policies that are raising educational and health levels in many parts of the developing world. The authors argue that these economic and social policies will be strengthened as markets for all manner of goods and services in developing countries are being linked by technology, telecommunications, and multinational investors. Thus, the 'boom' scenario sets the vision for creating wealth in the 21st century and provides the analytical propositions of the book: Very profitable business opportunities will arise, but managing in this new era will be complicated.<br /> Using their vast experience of doing business in both Western and Third World markets, Vogl and Sinclair then tackle in Part Two, Risks, Values and Opportunities, some of the risks associated with the 'boom' scenario by looking at increasing military spending and the populist challenges to fragile democracies in the emerging economies. The road to wealth is not without obstacles and the authors warn that corruption is the single greatest threat to this scenario. Vogl and Sinclair describe this corruption threat in detail and the global actions being taken to curb this disease.<br />They also argue that the investors and businesses that fare best will be those that make the greatest effort to understand the global, political, and economic trends now emerging and those that strategize accordingly. Smart investors are already positioning themselves to take full advantage of the boom, as are many multinational corporations. They know that the maximization of profit will increasingly depend on going global and they recognize that the fastest rates of economic growth in coming years will not be in the United States, Germany, UK and Japan but in Third World countries.<br />In Part Three, Doing Business in the 21st Century, Vogl and Sinclair provide their insights into this 'boom' scenario by outlining the strategies and tactics to make full use of it. They describe the critical management considerations for winning in the new era of intensified global business competition where business conditions in almost all markets will be more competitive than ever before. From setting goals, gathering business intelligence, and building contacts to positioning in new markets, BOOM provides corporations with a blueprint for success in this new era. Business leaders should also realise, however, that the political environment of much of the Third World is changing, democracy is spreading and demands for the public accountability of public servants are rising. Thus, multinational corporations will need to change their ways, too, and in this context, partnership is the absolute key. Tomorrow's global corporations must work towards open, honest partnerships with their host country stakeholders: governments, joint venture associates, strategic alliance partners, customers, suppliers and employees.   The 'boom' scenario also poses many crucial questions for European and American managers and companies: Will the start of the new century see a fundamental shift in global economic and political power towards Asia? What will be the consequences of this? Can, for example, UK industry compete in the increasingly global market? Is it inevitable that British industry will reduce employment at home as it builds new bases in lower cost, more productive Asian and African locations? Will the boom's creation of a large Third World middle class to mean a vast consumer market also mean a major political challenge to the status quo? Will this emergent Third World middle class provide the impetus for a New World Order?   These are the pertinent questions posed by this important new book. Practising what they preach, Vogl and Sinclair bring together the diverse strands of their analysis, highlighting their vision in BOOM by describing the approaches they have taken to build Sutton Resources Ltd, a successful international minerals exploration company listed on NASDAQ. The authors outline their own experiences and demonstrate that they practise what they have described throughout the book. &quot;Sutton does not pay bribes, it earns goodwill, it engages in partnerships and it is winning,&quot; they state.<br />Reviewed by Azlan Adnan.

As the title suggests, this book is about lies. The 17 lies referred to in the title of this book are the very damaging lies to the soul that we send down deep inside ourselves that convince us that we are powerlessly trapped in mediocrity. And awareness is the key to the truth that will set us free.<br />In this book the author focuses on helping ordinary people like us break free of the self-told myths that keep us from realising our full potential. We have all lied to ourselves when we make self-defeating excuses such as: It's who you know; That's just the way I am; I'm not good with people; and There's nothing I can do.<br />In simple, clear language, the author dramatically reveals that we already have self-awareness, and that is the key to all the power we need to free ourselves. With his trademark energy and humour, Chandler shows us how to overcome self-imposed constraints like laziness, fear, and addiction. Most importantly, in this breakthrough book, he makes the learning process entertaining and fun. This book will help us love ourselves and realise once and for all that only the truth can set us free.<br />Steve Chandler may arguably be the most original and inspiring figure in the highly competitive world of motivational speaking.

This book offers new generations of managers insights into Maslow's influential theories which have emerged in modern business, approaches such as continuous improvement, enlightened management, Theory X, and empowerment. Maslow's work has powerfully affected managerial theory, organizational development, education, health care, and science as well as psychology.<br />A true classic, Maslow on Management is still as important as when it first appeared and thus essential reading for all managers.<br />The late Abraham Maslow is the most widely known expert on human behaviour and motivation.

It gives examples of outstanding companies that have lost their market leadership when confronted with disruptive changes in technology and market structure. Drawing on patterns of innovation in a variety of industries, including computers, retailing, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and steel, the author shows how breakthrough innovations are initially rejected by mainstream customers because they cannot currently use them. <br />This rejection can lead firms with strong customer focus to allow strategically important innovations to languish. An excessive customer focus prevents firms from creating new markets and finding new customers for the products of the future. As they unwittingly bypass opportunities, such firms can clear the way for more nimble, entrepreneurial companies to catch the next great wave of industry growth.<br />Using the lessons of successes and failures of leading companies, The Innovator's Dilemma presents a set of convention-defying rules on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. This, then, is the innovator's dilemma: when to apply the rules of disruptive innovation that goes so much head-to-head against the conventional wisdom.<br />Clayton M. Christensen is an associate professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School.

Subsequently, there is a dearth of materials on managing in Asia and Asian business success stories. This book helps to fill the void, giving valuable information from the leading names in Asian business markets. Now, for the first time, some of the region's best and brightest business leaders have been brought together in one exciting collection. <br />Rajat Gupta of McKinsey, Stan Shih of Acer, Washington SyCip of SGV Group, Joanna Lau of LAU Technologies, David K.P. Li of Bank of East Asia Ltd, Cheong Choong Kong of Singapore Airlines, are some of the 32 leading Asian CEOs who share their thoughts on doing business in Asia. Informative, insightful, and inspirational, the book offers a fascinating glimpse into the finest business minds in the region. <br />The 32 articles in Asian Business Wisdom are organised into six parts covering Management Philosophies, Instilling Corporate Culture, The Entrepreneurial Spirit, Lessons from China, Sales and Marketing Strategies and Managing in Tough Times. Each article is accompanied by an introduction that highlights its author's life and business achievements and a list of online resources which points the reader to related articles or organisations.<br />Sadly, except for a passing reference to Robert Kuok Hock Nien on page 169, Malaysians are conspicuous by their absence in this book.

Despite it being the new millennium, we adults continue to do a lousy job of educating ourselves and our young people about sex. <br />Part of the reason is that, in Asian culture, we're often embarrassed to talk about sex, especially when it comes to talking with our own flesh and blood. As parents, many of us avoid the subject entirely. Often, even when we do work up the courage to have a heart-to-heart talk with &quot;the kids,&quot; we don't do much more than warn our daughters to avoid pregnancy and scare our sons with the threat of sexually transmitted diseases. <br />While these are certainly important points to cover, where does an adolescent learn about issues of good sexual functioning, such as how to have an orgasm, or how to be the best lover possible? This is where books on human sexuality such as this play their role in sex education.<br />However, this otherwise excellent primer on human sexuality is marred by a number of inaccuracies that are really quite inexcusable. In the diagram of The innards of the vulva (Figure 3-2) on page 35, the labia minora are incorrectly labelled as the labia majora and the entrance to the vagina is incorrectly labelled as the labia minora. <br />On page 188, the author devotes a mere three paragraphs to the G-spot before inaccurately concluding that &quot;there has never been any scientifically validated proof that it exists.&quot; A grandmother, Dr Ruth K. Westheimer would be well advised to keep up on current literature. Dr Westheimer does admit, however, on Page 4 that she is &quot;old-fashioned and a square.&quot;<br />Dr Westheimer's writing on relationship issues, however, does benefit from her long experience as a mother, grandmother and sex therapist. Much of her advice is pragmatic and makes much sense.<br />Reviewed by Azlan Adnan.

As someone who has lived in London for a total of eight years, I would recommend this guide not only to tourists but also to foreigners who live in London, including students and businessmen.<br />This guide is divided into seven parts, each consisting of between three and six chapters. Parts I &amp; II, Getting Started and Ironing Out the Details are really meant to be read before you arrive in London as they deal with the advance planning aspects of your trip; such as booking your flight and hotel, and obtaining your passport.<br />The other Parts deal with transportation (including how to use London buses and The Tube), accommodation, dining, entertainment, and shopping. My favourite in Chapter 17: More Cool Things to See and Do which will really make your stay in London unforgettable. London has many unique sights and cultural features that are not available elsewhere. While many Londoners take these for granted, foreigners simply do not know that such places exist and tend to go to the usual tourist spots. Chapter 17 will be a real eye-opener to the heart and soul of historical and cultural London. Much of the information in the other chapters may be obtained for free from a number of sources, either on the Internet or tourist brochures but Chapter 17 and Part VII are what really make this guide unique and invaluable.<br />The final Part, Part VII, consists of various interesting odds and ends that don't fit into the other chapters. Overall, the many maps, addresses and websites make this guide extremely handy indeed.<br />Reviewed by Azlan Adnan, MA who has lived in lived for a total of eight years, initially as a student at Brunel University, the University of Westminster and the University of London.

Can contraceptives protect me from AIDS? How can I choose the method that's best for me? Finding the answers to these and other questions about birth control can be tough. On the one hand, today's young couples have many contraceptive options. On the other hand, each option has pluses and minuses that must be weighed.<br />This book is a detailed guide to the methods of birth control currently available, plus a brief review of new methods being developed. Each chapter describes a specific method and provides information to help you choose a contraceptive suited to you and your current situation. Chapters discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each contraceptive, safety concerns, general effectiveness, side effects, costs, and how to obtain and use it.<br />As you think about the birth control options available to you, remember no single method may be ideal or totally reliable. Furthermore, many contraceptives have some side effects and most require a certain amount of care in their use. To choose the right one for you, be thoughtful about the disadvantages as well as the advantages. If you are comfortable with your birth control choice, you are more likely to use it every time and to stick with it. If possible, the decision about what method to choose should be made with your spouse. As this guide demonstrates, it is much easier to use a contraceptive correctly when both of you are involved.<br />This guide includes up-to-date information on new products, such as the female condom and the non-latex male condom. Only birth control methods that are currently available or show every promise of being available soon are discussed. <br />The book also provides details about contraception and its relation to sexually transmitted diseases, with an emphasis on AIDS. Also offered is an expanded discussion of &quot;emergency&quot; contraception, designed for use after unprotected sex. Many of the methods discussed in this guiderequire a visit to a health practitioner as such at family planning services, independent clinics and hospitals. <br />Although clearly intended for someone planning to use a contraceptive method, this book is detailed enough to be useful to nurses and youth counselors interested in the subject. Whether you intend to have children or not, every newlywed couple owes it to themselves and their loved ones to read this book.<br />Reviewed by Azlan Adnan.

Carson had advocated that the methods we employ for pest control must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects. Yet today, despite the lip service we pay to Silent Spring, and in spite of considerable environmental protest, public outcry and the availability of viable alternatives, we still choose to spray chemical pesticides at an alarming rate. In fact, chemical pesticides still remain our pest control method of choice.<br />Our attitude is to approach pests as organisms to control rather than manage; we exterminate instead of reduce; we dominate rather than learn to accommodate. Why this sad state of affairs remains so is a central theme of this book, which introduces the concept of pest management (as opposed to pest control). Pest management forces us to look beyond the immediate benefits and disadvantages, costs and side effects, of pest control methods towards choosing alternatives that are more environmentally compatible and less harmful to our own health. The author explores scientifically exciting alternative technologies such as biological control, yet admits, as the 1990 gypsy moth invasion of Vancouver has shown, that the public needs more education and assurance on its safety and environmental correctness.<br />This book provides such an education and forms the basis for novel biologically based strategies involving pheromones, parasitic insects, bio-engineered crops and pest diseases to become standard practice.<br />Mark L. Winston is professor of biological sciences at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. He is the author of two previous books, The Biology of the Honey Bee and Killer Bees.	2000-09-24

Libertarian activist  Huber takes on chapter by chapter the big issues of environmental  discourse, from scarcity and pollution to efficiency and waste disposal.  Hard Green is a strongly argued critique of environmentalism from the  political right. Huber argues that Soft Green environmental policies do  exactly the opposite of what they intend, and lays out a clear program for  a Hard Green approach to the environment.

The author has, therefore, used  lucid, expressive and entertaining language to clear up our misconceptions  about this intrinsically fascinating branch of mathematics.<br />Used for  seeking divine direction, decision-making and games, the practice of chance  mechanisms have been discovered throughout Mesopotamia, the Indus valley,  Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire. Yet, probability was not seriously  studied until the mid-17th century. Historians have long wondered why  conceptual progress in this field was so slow, given that humans have  encountered chance repeatedly from earliest times. <br />The answer lies in  the difficulty of understanding randomness. Probability is based on the  concept of a random event, and statistical inference is based on the  distribution of random samples. Often, we assume that the concept of  randomness is obvious. Yet, problems having to do with chance typically  appear simple and amenable to solution with natural good sense, only to be  proven otherwise. Over the course of 10 chapters, this book investigates a  series of ideas central to the historical development of probabilistic  thinking.<br />This book is highly recommended to anyone who is a total  beginner when it comes to probability as it not only elucidates the reader  on the subject, but also explains why probability is often  counter-intuitive and hence desperately puzzling. Despite its abstruse  nature, probability is a very useful tool and this book shows how it can be  used to good effect. Filled with historical asides, this handy,  pocket-sized book will clear up your misconceptions. Despite its easy-going  conversational style, it is a thorough academic work with 50 pages of  references, bibliography and the index.<br />Deborah J.

Until now,  the eleven self-made black business leaders featured-The Titans of the  Black Enterprise 100s-were virtually unknown, even to American business  students. Yet, they run America's largest black-owned companies and have  been the vanguard of an entrepreneurial revolution. Achieving success  despite lack of capital, diminished access, and outright racism, they used  inspiration and drive to seize opportunities and break barriers. They are  black America's wealthiest and most powerful players, providing employment,  training, and advancement for large numbers of African Americans.<br />They  represent, in many ways, the economic evolution of post-war African  Americans. The first step in the effort for black equality was driven  largely by the Civil Rights Movement, which led to the social and legal  reforms of the 1950s and 1960s. Next, the passage of the Civil Rights Act  of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which eliminated such barriers  to political activity as the poll tax and illiteracy test, gave rise to the  increase in black political strength with the election of blacks to  Congress in the late 1960s and 1970s. Those events were followed by the  propulsion of black economic power in which African Americans gained an  opportunity to amass wealth and achieve the American Dream that had been  elusive for so long. In the 1980s and 1990s, blacks, who gained access to  the nation's leading universities and major corporations, leveraged their  education and experience to acquire and finance new companies as well as  develop enterprises through emerging technologies.<br />The eleven chapters of  this book each tell the untold story of these titans and the contributions  they and their companies have made to American industry and life. Their  stories and ideas will instruct, inspire, illuminate and motivate the  reader to build on their success. This book is a source of inspiration and  motivation to the next generation of captains of industry of all races and  both genders the world over.<br />Derek T.

In 1992, Mead spearheaded a transformation of Tenneco,  one of the nation's most troubled conglomerates. He went on to become a  policy shaper and voice of American industry as chairman of the National  Association of Manufacturers.<br />High Standards, Hard Choices takes a rare  look at the convictions of a man on the front lines during a time when  companies were reborn and heroes were made. It documents a series of  dramatic events in the widely publicised struggle of Tenneco's Mike Walsh  against an aggressive brain cancer. Mead was forced to juggle increasing  pressures to keep Tenneco's recovery on course. In this memoir, Mead  convincingly captures the hopes, risks and turmoil of Tenneco's frustrating  bid to gain new business overseas while conducting an unrelenting battle to  change federal policy in Washington, DC.<br />The essence of a tough-minded,  humanitarian brand of leadership makes this book a source of inspiration  for readers in all walks of management life.<br />Dana G. Mead (1936- ) was  Chairman and CEO of Tenneco from 1994 to 1999 as well as chairman of the  Business Roundtable (1998-99). A retired Army colonel with a doctorate in  political science and economics from MIT, Mead served as a White House  Fellow in 1970. Thomas C.

Why does  virtually every serious management book recognize, document, and praise his  insights? How do his life and his legacy continue to inspire and inform the  visions of today's most alert and innovative entrepreneurs? Why is global  interest now mounting in his multifaceted work? <br />Fascinating and  visionary, Abraham Harold Maslow (1908-1970) pioneered revolutionary ideas  that helped form modern psychology and laid the foundation of the human  side of management and marketing. His lifetime of discoveries in motivation  and personality transcended academic psychology, and extended into the  major business fields of management and marketing. Maslow also loved to  explore nascent, barely perceptible social trends and speculate boldly  about their long-term consequences. He was the originator of such important  concepts as the hierarchy of human needs, self-actualization, higher  motivation, team decision-making and business synergy.<br />All business  students-not just of management development and organizational  behaviour-should read this seminal biography. Critically acclaimed in its  first edition and now revised and updated for this paperback edition, The  Right to Be Human is a fascinating portrait of one of the seminal thinkers  of the twentieth century-at once a vivid biography of a truly original  personality and an intellectual journey to the very source of how we think  about and manage our businesses today. <br />Edward Hoffman, PhD, is a  clinical psychologist in New York with degrees from Cornell University and  the University of Michigan.

One reason for it being such a stimulating  subject is that in order to study it you have to enter into the debate  rather than observe it from the sidelines.<br />This anthology of basic  philosophical readings is ideal for anyone coming to philosophy for the  first time as it demonstrates philosophy in action. Nigel Warburton brings  philosophy to life with an imaginative selection of 44 philosophical  writings on key topics by such renown philosophers as A.J. Ayer, Bertrand  Russell, Blaise Pascal, David Hume, Richard Dawkins, Immanuel Kant, John  Stuart Mill, Thomas Hobbes, RenÃ© Descartes, George Berkeley, Karl Popper  and Ludwig Wittgenstein. These carefully chosen readings are easy to  understand, are accessible and will give the reader a thorough  understanding of philosophy. <br />The aim has not been comprehensive coverage  of all the central topics in philosophy, but rather interesting coverage of  a selection of topics. Each chapter considers a key area of philosophy  grouped under the following themes:  * What is philosophy? * God * Right  and wrong * Politics * The external world * Science * Mind * Art <br />Each  theme in this book complements the sections in the companion volume  Philosophy: The Basics (3rd edition 1999) by the same author.	2000-08-19

The  greatest threats to the so-called `giants' can come from the most  unexpected quarters. Suddenly a small, independent company from the other  side of the world can, without warning, take large chunks of your market  share. They can do this because they are quicker of thought, more flexible  in attitude and more closely attuned to the real needs of their customers  than you are.<br />In this book, Robert Baldock looks at the ways in which you  can change the nature of your business so that you can begin the 21st  century on at least an equal footing with your hungry, determined  competitors. This includes looking at the nature of what you offer to your  customers, the relationship you have with your customers, and the level to  which you should continue trying to do everything internally against the  option of outsourcing.<br />The author concludes by giving us a  three-dimensional mental model to visualise when thinking about the kinds  of things we should be doing.<br />Robert Baldock (1955- ) was, until  recently, a global managing partner in Anderson Consulting, the management  and technology consultancy, responsible for eCommerce, Customer  Relationship Management and Mergers and Acquisitions within the Financial  Services Industry.

Not only does he invent the  phonograph and the first successful electric light bulb, but he also  establishes the first electrical power distribution company and lays the  technological groundwork for today's movies, telephones, and sound  recording industry. Through relentless tinkering, by trial and error, the  story goes, Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931) perseveres-and changes the  world.<br />In the revelatory Edison: A Life of Invention, the author exposes  and enriches this one-dimensional view of the solitary &quot;Wizard of  Menlo Park,&quot; expertly situating his subject within a thoroughly  realized portrait of a burgeoning country on the brink of massive change.  The second half of the nineteenth century witnessed the birth of corporate  America, and with it the newly overlapping interests of scientific,  technological, and industrial cultures. Working against the common  perception of Edison as a symbol of a mythic American past where  persistence and individuality yielded hard-earned success, Israel  demonstrates how Edison's remarkable career was actually very much a  product of the inventor's fast-changing era. Edison drew widely from  contemporary scientific knowledge and research, and was a crucial figure in  the transformation of invention into modern corporate research and  collaborative development.<br />Informed by more than five million pages of  archival documents, this ambitious biography of Edison brightens the  unexamined corners of a singularly influential and triumphant career in  science. In these pages, history's most prolific inventor-he received an  astounding 1,093 U.S. patents-comes to life as never before. Edison is the  only biography to cover the whole of Edison's career in invention,  including his early, foundational work in telegraphy. Armed with  unprecedented access to Edison's workshop diaries, notebooks, and letters,  this book brings fresh insights into how the inventor's creative mind  worked. And for the first time, much attention is devoted to his early  family life in Ohio and Michigan-where the young Edison honed his  entrepreneurial sense and eye for innovation as a newsstand owner and  editor of a weekly newspaper-underscoring the inventor's later successes  with new resonance and pathos.<br />In recognizing the inventor's legacy as a  pivotal figure in the second Industrial Revolution, the author highlights  Edison's creation of the industrial research laboratory, driven by  intricately structured teams of researchers. The efficient lab forever  changed the previously serendipitous art of workshop invention into  something regular, predictable, and very attractive to corporate business  leaders. Indeed, Edison's collaborative research model became the prototype  upon which today's research firms and think tanks are based.<br />The portrait  of Thomas Alva Edison that emerges from this peerless biography is of a man  of genius and astounding foresight. It is also a portrait rendered with  incredible care, depth, and dimension, rescuing our century's godfather of  invention from myth and simplification.<br />Paul Israel is the Managing  Editor of the multivolume documentary edition of the Thomas Edison Papers  at Rutgers University and the coauthor of Edison's Electric Light.

It is, in fact, recommended for environmental NGOs,  policy makers, teachers, youth workers and community leaders who work with  children.<br />This book was commissioned by UNICEF to further growing  concerns of global importance: the environment, sustainable development and  children's rights. All over world, children are becoming enthusiastically  involved in environmental issues. While the child is defined as any person  under 18 years of age, the focus of this book is on childhood and early  adolescence to about 14 years, rather than upon the older teenage years.<br />  Roger Hart is convinced that all children can play a central and lasting  role in sustainable development if their genuine participation is taken  seriously and if communities recognize their developing competencies and  unique strengths. Using detailed case studies from urban and rural, poor  and middle-class communities in both the developed and developing worlds,  and including photos, figures, tables and boxes, this guide introduces the  organising principles, successful models, practical techniques and  resources for involving children in environmental projects, with useful  further reading and contact addresses.<br />Roger Hart is Director of the  Children's Environments Research Group at the City University of New York  and Editor of Children's Environments.	2000-07-31

Marketing is  the single most important determinant of success as the ability to  satisfy-or delight-customers is the only determinant of an enterprise's  ability to generate revenues. No enterprise exists for its own sake but  rather its mission is to meet the needs of those customers it was created  to serve.<br />Thus, marketing, according to author Peter Doyle, is the  philosophy of management that recognises that the success of the enterprise  is only sustainable if it can organise to meet the current and prospective  needs of customers more effectively than the competition. Marketing tries  to get the enterprise to develop and offer what the customer will find of  real value. In this way, marketing seeks to build long-term, mutually  beneficial partnerships between the enterprise and its customers.<br />This  innovative book is for senior managers and those taking advanced marketing  courses on MBA, CIM and similar post-experience programmes. It focuses on  strategic planning and decision making in today's rapidly changing and  highly competitive global markets.<br />Peter Doyle is Professor of Marketing  and Strategic Management at the University of Warwick, where he heads both  the executive and MBA programmes. He has previously held positions at  INSEAD, London Business School, Bradford University, Stanford and the  University of Hawaii.

The idea that inner change makes outer change possible  has always been part of spiritual and psychological teachings. Change the  World presents eight principles that each of us can follow to make  individual and organisational change happen. These principles were inspired  by the teachings of Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King,  Jr.-three historical leaders who successfully used personal change to  change the world.<br />Author Robert Quinn introduces each principle with  inspiring quotations from these three leaders. He then uses stories from  everyday life to demonstrate his message. Every thought-provoking chapter  is imbued with ideas and information that can help us step out of our old  roles, approach the world with a sense of enlightenment and adventure, and  live a more empowered and empowering life.<br />Faced with the complexities of  today's world, it's all too easy to view ourselves as passive observers or  powerless victims. We want to change our realities, but lack the motivation  to do so.<br />This book is for ordinary people who have the ordinary need to  have extraordinary impact. It is written for everyone of us who want to use  personal transformation to make a positive impact on our families,  organisations, businesses, and the world at large. Indeed, this is the  central message of the book. Ordinary people have the need to be profoundly  effective change agents, and ordinary people can be extraordinary change  agents.<br />Robert E.

What it took to turn the company around was hours  and hours of hard work; thoughtful, innovative, and proactive programs; the  willingness to lead and take risks; and most of all, an absolute commitment  to do the right thing. Eventually, Fortune magazine ranked Denny's among  the top ten companies for minorities in America.<br />The Denny's Story is the  real-life account of how the company pulled itself out of a public  relations nightmare and earned back the trust of its customers.

He was the first to apply the findings in behavioural  science to the world of business. Based on what had been learned about  human behaviour, McGregor explored the implications of managing people in a  different manner than tradition dictated.<br />Authors Gary Heil, Deborah  Stephens and Warren Bennis assert that the nature of work today makes  McGregor's ideas more important and relevant than ever before. This book  revisits in a contemporary manner the most important question facing  management today: given what we know about human nature, how should work be  managed so as to unleash the vast creative potential of human beings? It  applies McGregor's thinking to today's business world, proving again that  the human aspect of work is crucial to organisational effectiveness. It  also suggests how you can change your thinking and implement his ideas in  your own business and workplace.<br />The authors carefully outline how to put  McGregor's thinking into practice in your own business so you can devise a  better performance management system, form and supervise effective  management teams, build cooperation instead of internal competition,  cultivate an intrinsically motivating, values-driven workplace and create a  cause worthy of employee commitment.	2000-07-31

Many writers use journals to write informally, often spontaneously, to describe real or imagined  people, places, and events. Artists and naturalists as well fill  sketchbooks with both words and images to help focus their observations.  Frank Ching, the author of this sketchbook, not only records the optical  reality of what is seen; he uses these drawings as a means of gaining  understanding, insight, and perhaps even inspiration. His drawings  stimulate the mind to think and can even make visible aspects that cannot  be seen by the naked eye, or captured on film by a camera.<br />Frank Ching  made most of the drawings in this sketchbook in or around O-okayama, a town  southwest of downtown Tokyo, where the Tokyo Institute of Technology is  located. The subject matter ranges from street scenes to traditional  construction details, from temples and their sacred precincts to  stimulating juxtapositions of old and new. He has successfully captured the  sights, sounds and even smells of vibrant metropolis Tokyo, enabling the  reader to feel the humid heat of the day or the cool rainy mist that fell  as he drew. In addition, there are scenes sketched during the author's  brief excursion to Kyoto and the mountain village of Takayama<br />All the  drawings were executed in a pure contour-line technique with a fountain pen  and black ink. There is a crispness and finality to an inkline that is both  daunting and exciting. The process not only fostered the careful  observation of details; it also required seeing how they fit into the  larger framework and pattern of shapes, and noting which details could be  omitted. The shape and extent of the white spaces are as important to a  composition as what is delineated.<br />Francis D.K. Ching (1943- ) completed  a month in the spring of 1990 as a visiting scholar at the Tokyo Institute  of Technology which he spent producing this sketchbook.	2000-07-31

But in order to survive in the next century, businesses must learn to think far more radically and be willing to  accommodate yet more dramatic changes throughout their organisations. The  past is no longer a reliable indicator of the future. The face of business  today is virtually unrecognisable from that of 20 years ago. Robert Baldock  forsees an even greater degree of change in the next five years, reflecting  an acceleration in the process.<br />Innovatively written as if the author's  suppositions are already history, the book presents five very different  scenarios of the future of business, including a &quot;wild card&quot;  which pushes predictions of the future to the boundaries of plausibility.  Five very different scenarios-and yet elements of them are bound to  transpire. Thinking about these outcomes can help managers to thrive in the  emerging world of the future. To point you towards your own action plan the  final chapter draws together lessons of the five scenarios and harnesses  them into reliable strategies which will serve in any eventuality.<br />If  your role is in management you must prepare for the unpredictable.

Access to genetic resources and their commercial development involve a wide range of parties such as  conservation and research institutes, local communities, government  agencies and companies. Equitable partnerships are not only crucial to  conservation and economic development, but are also in the interest of  business and often required by law.<br />The Convention on Biological  Diversity (CBD) has brought a long overdue international focus and control  on the access to, and use of, genetic resources. As the details and  consequences of the CBD are worked out by many different bodies, there has  been much confusion. For anyone wanting information about the implications  of the CBD for their business, research or livelihood, the data are  scattered in a confusing array of sources. This book brings this subject  together in such a thorough way that it will be welcomed by many people. In  this authoritative and comprehensive volume the authors explain the  provisions of the CBD on access and benefit-sharing, the effect of national  laws to implement these, and aspects of typical contracts for the transfer  of materials. They provide a unique sector-by-sector analysis of how  genetic resources are used, the scientific, technological and regulatory  trends and the different markets in pharmaceuticals, botanical medicines,  crop development, horticulture, crop protection, biotechnology (in fields  other than healthcare and agriculture) and personal care and cosmetics  products. The chapters on each sector are presented in a balanced way  because of the extensive consultations that the authors held with  representatives of each industry discussed.<br />Of special to Malaysians is  the description of the joint venture between a pharmaceutical company based  in Illinois, Medichem Research Inc, and the State Government of Sarawak to  develop anti-HIV Calanolide compounds derived from Calophyllum lanigerum, a  plant found in Sarawak.<br />This will be an essential sourcebook for all  those in the commercial chain, from raw material collection to product  discovery, development and marketing, for governments and policy-makers  drafting laws on access and for all the institutions, communities and  individuals involved in the conservation, use study and commercialization  of genetic resources. It is an invaluable resource to policy makers,  organizations studying and creating uses of genetic resources and the  companies that wish to develop them. This book will be widely used to help  governments draw up more practical laws and to help industrial companies to  ensure the participation of and reasonable compensation for those countries  who possess and provide access to so much biodiversity, while at the same  time helping industries to avoid legal risks. This book will also be  invaluable to universities, research institutes and botanic gardens as we  work out the new role that has been placed upon us since the CBD was  ratified, that of acting as intermediaries between biodiverse countries and  would-be users of their genetic resources.<br />Kerry ten Kate is Head of the  Convention on Biological Diversity Unit at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.  Formerly a practising barrister, and member of the Secretariat of the  United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) during the  preparations for the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, she is now responsible for  coordinating the design and implementation of Kew's policies in response to  the CBD.

The nobles, on the other hand, led lives of opulent  leisure. This scenario had not changed from the days of their ancestors.  Yet, there were unmistakable signs that all this would soon change forever.  The seeds of republicanism were spreading in Europe while the United States  was proving to the world the feasibility of a government of, by and for the  people. France and England had established global empire-building  strategies. Thus, the year 1800 saw the world suddenly enmeshed in a web of  mercantilism, war, and political intrigue.

The realisation that their family's financial future was entirely dependent  on benevolent employers and a lifetime of full-time work was a  disheartening condition they wanted to change-quickly.<br />Unlike most  Americans, in eight short years, the Tooheys managed to save nearly half  their modest income while adding almost US$500,000 to their net worth. They  now have enough money to cover most expenses for the rest of their  lives-even if they never earn another paycheque. The Tooheys do not claim  that this was easy, but it was doable. And it can be for you, too. They do  not propose that you implement extreme changes or even suffer to get there.  In fact, the point of this book is to provide strategies to achieve  financial independence without earning more money, relocating, or changing  jobs. Theirs is a moderate, non-threatening approach.<br />This book is  understandable, informal, and conversational. It will challenge you to  analyse how you do things and make creative adjustments so you can build  assets without suffering. Because you aren't paid a lot, you simply can't  afford to make big mistakes with your money, so you need to keep your head  in the game and make smart choices. Learning, thoughtful reflection, and  creativity lead to smart decisions and financial freedom without suffering.  Anyone can just stop spending their income and pile up money, but it takes  careful planning and creativity to build assets while still enjoying life.  Learn how to build a large nest egg for your family, do it fast and  accomplish it without suffering. This book will show the average family the  way to financial freedom.<br />Bill Toohey (1952- ) and Mary Toohey (1953- )  lecture widely and have written several magazine articles on their sound  money strategies.

Yet, in some very important  ways, Chinese customs, practices, and values remain alien to Western  business thinking and practice as they ever were. As many a hapless  expatriate manager has discovered to their cost, gaining a foothold in the  vast Chinese market can be an uphill battle on a slippery slope of  tradition, conflicting objectives, bureaucratic wrangling, ever-shifting  laws and regulations, and regional differences. Despite this, as the  stories chronicled in this insider's guide to doing business in China  demonstrate, it is a battle that can be and is being won.<br />The New Silk  Road is based on extensive interviews conducted by the author with business  leaders who have many years of experience with the country. It features a  series of lively narratives in which these experts share their insights  into and observations of all the important aspects of doing business in  China. These are important lessons they've learned about everything from  making sense of, and marketing to, the patchwork of striking different  regions that make up China, to building trust and negotiating with the  Chinese.<br />This long-awaited insider's view of doing business in China  informs you of the pitfalls and tells you what you need to know to succeed  in the twenty-first century's great new business frontier.<br />John B.

Richard Welford demonstrates how modern business has ignored-even usurped-the wider  ecological, ethical and social aspects of sustainable development. Industry  has, in effect, hijacked the more radical environmental debate by taking it  out of its traditional discourse, and placing it in a liberal-productivist  frame of reference. <br />Welford examines the ways in which business  executives have reconstructed the environmental agenda to pander to their  own purposes. He then shows how businesses continue to operate outside the  ecological carrying capacity of the environment, and that there remain  strong underlying tensions involving conflicts between sustainable  development and international trade. He shows how too much emphasis on  hierarchical organizational structures stifle participation inside the  organization.<br />The final part of the book examines the way forward for the  more sustainable business. It presents new models of the sustainable  organization which place greater emphasis on issues such as equity and  ethics. It seeks an ecological awakening amongst business leaders and  concludes with a call for more critical research on business activities,  abandoning both the restrictive positivist and traditional interpretive  paradigms of analysis. <br />The contributions in this book are best read as a  set of related essays and each chapter can easily be read and understood in  isolation. Hijacking Environmentalism is recommended for business leaders,  management students and activists with environmental NGOs.<br />Richard  Welford is Professor of Corporate Environmental Management and Director of  the Centre for Corporate Environmental Management at the Huddersfield  University Business School.

In one of the most surprising and important discoveries in cosmology of the century, astronomers recently found that the universe may be expanding at an ever-increasing-rather than gradually decreasing-rate. This startling  discovery has ignited a new revolution in cosmology in which scientists are  wrestling anew with the most fundamental questions and revisiting ideas  that were dismissed long ago.<br />The discovery that the expansion of the  universe appears in fact to be speeding up-and therefore that the universe  will keep expanding faster and faster for infinity-is troubling as it  threatens the long-cherished belief that the fundamental laws governing the  cosmos are in themselves perfectly balanced and  &quot;beautiful.&quot;<br />What can explain this accelerated expansion? Does  the universe have much less mass than originally thought? Is there some  exotic unknown force, or new kind of energy, causing acceleration? Was  Einstein's &quot;greatest blunder&quot;-his idea of a Cosmological  Constant-the right idea after all? What will the ultimate fate of the  universe be?<br />In an entertaining and lively exploration of the answers to  all these questions, Mario Livio introduces readers to the &quot;old  cosmology&quot; offering lucid explanations of all the key concepts and  theoretical ideas pertaining to the Beauty of the Cosmos. He then presents  all of the ideas now being explored by cosmologists in the &quot;new  cosmology&quot; as they come to grips with the &quot;ugly&quot; discovery  of acceleration. <br />Mario Livio, PhD, is the head of the science programme  at the Space Science Institute, which conducts the scientific program of  the Hubble Space Telescope. A world-recognised expert on astrophysics, he  has published over 300 scientific papers and has lectured to the public  about discoveries in astronomy and cosmology all across the globe.	2000-07-31

Books	5	28	29	N	N	Definitive Pedagogical Guide to Lecturing	When this book was first published in 1971, the first edition sold out in ten weeks. Long regarded as a classic on the topic of lecturing, this book is an indispensable manual for anyone who aspires to be a skilled lecturer  and teacher. It examines the nature of teaching and learning in a classroom  lecture-describing how students learn, how much knowledge they retain, and  how to enhance their attention and motivation. <br />Bligh offers a wealth of  practical suggestions for making lectures more engaging and effective.  Topics include taking notes, using handouts, practising different formats  and styles, obtaining feedback, overcoming difficulties, evaluating the  lecture, and testing alternative methods when lecturing is not  adequate.<br />Written in an accessible and helpful style, this very readable  book is a source of great insight for people who lecture-experienced or  not. Teachers at every level will find straightforward and detailed  practical advice to help improve their lectures. However, the author  reminds us that, like musical composition and performance, lecturing is an  art. Skill is acquired by practice rather than by reading books. Yet just  as the budding composer may wish to study forms of composition known to  have been successful, but later disregard them, so new lecturers may wish  it worthwhile to consider the findings of research into lecturing before  developing their own style.<br />Donald A.

In this ground-breaking book, acclaimed science journalist Tom Siegfried introduces readers to the frontiers of the radical new physics of information, and to the host of amazing discoveries it is inspiring-from  the development of a stunning new breed of quantum computers, to methods  for writing supersecure codes, to revealing insights into the elaborate  computer-like workings of the cell and resolving long-standing mysteries  about the inner workings of black holes and how the universe evolved.<br />The  revolutionary insight central to all of this new science is that the most  fundamental constituents of matter are not atoms, or even subatomic  particles, but &quot;bits,&quot; the fundamental units of information.  Scientists are exploring an all-encompassing new path towards understanding  life, physics, and existence. The path leads through all of nature, from  the interior of cells to inside black holes. The conclusion is always the  same: the world is made of information.<br />Siegfried provides lucid and  entertaining explanations of the latest theories in quantum physics and how  they are being applied by quantum cryptographers to create secret codes  that are absolutely unbreakable. We learn how the mind-boggling physics of  &quot;reversible logic&quot; can recapture lost information and are  introduced to the controversy over M Theory, which some scientists argue is  the long-sought &quot;Theory of Everything.&quot;<br />This books offers the  lay reader an engaging, fast-paced introduction to a fundamentally new way  of seeing the world and an amazing glimpse into many of the hottest areas  of scientific endeavour today.<br />Tom Siegfried is the science editor of the  Dallas Morning News.

As firms mature, the loose, informal management styles that drove them to success become inadequate. Original systems are  strained, profits decline, and founders are ousted to make room for more  experienced managers.<br />Drawing on the case studies of recent success  stories, the authors show entrepreneurs how to make the successful  transition from humble start-up to professionally managed firm without  sacrificing the unique spirit that inspired the company in the first place.  They provide readers with a framework they can use to evaluate their firm's  growth objectively, anticipate problems, pinpoint solutions, and plan  strategies that will move their company towards desired goals. They outline  the seven predictable stages of organisational growth and identify what  must be accomplished in each stage to ensure the company's continued  healthy development.<br />Growing Pains provides the entrepreneur with many  proven principles of professional management, offering guidance in such key  areas as strategic planning, organisational structure, management  development, organisational control, leadership, and corporate culture  management. Thoroughly updated to address the realities of today's business  environment, this book will help company founders deal with the personal  and professional challenges they must confront as they transform their  companies into professionally managed firms.<br />Eric G.

And you would be wrong. As this  fascinating history of that procedure makes clear, circumcision is rooted  not in medical science, but in the deepest recesses of religion and  culture. <br />Circumcision is performed on more than one million infant and  prepubescent boys around the world every year. In America, even though a  growing number of physicians dispute its benefits, circumcision remains the  most frequently performed elective surgical procedure. In 1995, 64.1% of US  male newborns were circumcised-yet there is no proven medical benefit to  this practice on normal infants. This book, by medical historian David L.  Gollahar presents a fascinating history of this controversial practice and  why it has persisted over time through vastly different social  contexts.<br />As this book shows, the removal of genital foreskin has a long  and varied history: from the extraordinarily painful initiation rite of the  ancient Egyptians, through the Hebrew purification ritual, through its use  by nineteen-century doctors as prevention for ailments including  bedwetting, paralysis, syphilis, and epilepsy, to the present persistence  of female circumcision in African cultures. Gollaher also addresses the  current controversy over the procedure's continuance, and those opposing  routine circumcision will find support here.<br />Gollaher concludes that  &quot;if male circumcision were confined to developing nations,&quot;  similar to the status of female circumcision, &quot;it would by now have  emerged as an international cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre.&quot;<br />David L. Gollaher (1949-  )  is President and CEO of the California Healthcare Institute, a statewide  public policy research and advocacy institute.

It  polishes traditional market research techniques and reveals new ones that  can help any company avoid the pitfalls of focusing only on the present.

Marketing is  the single most important determinant of success as the ability to  satisfy-or delight-customers is the only determinant of an enterprise's  ability to generate revenues. No enterprise exists for its own sake but  rather its mission is to meet the needs of those customers it was created  to serve.<br />Thus, marketing, according to author Peter Doyle, is the  philosophy of management that recognises that the success of the enterprise  is only sustainable if it can organise to meet the current and prospective  needs of customers more effectively than the competition. Marketing tries  to get the enterprise to develop and offer what the customer will find of  real value. In this way, marketing seeks to build long-term, mutually  beneficial partnerships between the enterprise and its customers.<br />This  innovative book is for senior managers and those taking advanced marketing  courses on MBA, CIM and similar post-experience programmes. It focuses on  strategic planning and decision making in today's rapidly changing and  highly competitive global markets.<br />Peter Doyle is Professor of Marketing  and Strategic Management at the University of Warwick, where he heads both  the executive and MBA programmes.

Once a stodgy and sleepy thing, today's business news media is anything but fueled by a national obsession for investing. Business news has become the hottest media sector in America and the world. Which is wonderful news  for companies that can get their intended message across, and seriously bad  news for those that can't. They risk being ignored, misrepresented,  or-worst of all-left vulnerable to damaging hearsay and rumour. <br />The rise  of the business news media, the emergence of the consumer-investor, and the  technological developments that have opened up the world into a 24  hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week superstore of information and opinion have  occurred almost overnight. So swift are the changes that even companies  considered to be leaders in communications are scrambling to keep up.  Consumers of news, too, are overwhelmed with information overload,  uncertain about what's reliable and what's not. And yes, even the media are  having difficulty keeping up with its own growth in terms of finding talent  to keep the big new media pipeline full of credible and useful information  and insight. Everyone on all sides of the new media equation is struggling  to keep pace.<br />This book is for those who want to understand more about  the increasing dynamic relationship between companies and the news media  that covers them. A company that blames the news media for creating or  contributing to its problems is misleading itself. Similarly, a reporter  who blames a company for trying to promote or protect itself through public  relations-and thereby somehow &quot;obscuring truth&quot;-is failing to  understand that a company's main reasons for being are to survive and  succeed, not cater to the news media's agenda.<br />In between what a company  wants and what a reporter wants lies the issue that is the focus of this  book. It is, quite simply, a knowledge gap. Many companies, particularly  young ones, don't know how to tell their stories to the media properly.Many reporters, particularly those new to the business beat, don't know  enough about the complexities of business to make sense of information and  give it meaningful insight for their audiences. Complicating the process is  technology, which gives both sides the false impression that the ability to  move more and more information around the world 24 hours a day is useful.  Without context, this information overload is far from useful-it is  downright confusing. Add to this a growing hunger for insight, not just  information, from a new generation of consumer-investors who are taking  more responsibility for their financial futures, and the knowledge gap  becomes even wider.<br />Companies that understand the knowledge gap and take  steps to close it will see benefits. Most established companies that have  been around the media for some time get the point. But many young, small  companies, particularly those that are newly public, may not have caught on  the issue. They haven't learned how to promote or protect themselves. It is  these companies, especially, and the executives who run them, that this  book is directed.<br />If you manage a company, whether small, medium, or  large, there are a couple of things you need to do to make sure the gap  between what you do know and what you don't know doesn't get wider. Because  if it does, the consequences can be serious. And in an environment where  the media are a determining factor in the success or failure of your  company's reputation, you cannot afford to ignore what's going on.<br />First,  make sure you incorporate communications, particularly media relations,  into your strategic business plan. Communications should be as important as  manufacturing, sales, and distribution. Through communications, including  many of the aspects covered in this book, you can stay plugged in. When  done properly, communications can be an excellent way to get your messages  out and to receive information and insight from the environment in which  you do business. A communications effort does not need to be elaborate. But  you must get started. You must be part of this new environment. Every day  you lose, you fall further behind.<br />Second, get professional  communications help if you don't already have it. Consider good  communications and relationships with the media to be as serious an issue  as any other in your business. Just as you wouldn't think of attempting a  merger or acquisition without an investment bank, or making a substantial  investment for your company without a financial advisor, or tackle a  serious legal issue without lawyers, you cannot face the media without the  help of Public Relations professionals. The media is a specialized world  that requires specialists to manage on your behalf. A reliable public  relations agency or consultant can put together an effective plan,  including proactive, reactive, and crisis elements, at a relatively modest  cost.<br />In a nutshell, Total Exposure is the first book to offer senior  executives and Public Relations professionals both a clear understanding of  the transformation of business journalism and practical guidelines on  strategically managing their company's image in this new environment. It  explains how to:<br />* avoid overexposure by targeting credible journalists  and media forums  * find the right spokespeople and train them to say the  right things  * think like a reporter, understanding story angles and  agendas, and more <br />With the exception of the introductory chapter, each  of the 12 chapters of this book is summarized in bullet form at the end in  a `Summary of Trends' section and a `Lessons for Companies'  section.<br />Gustav Carlson is head of media relations for a major Wall  Street firm, PaineWebber.

This book brings those magical yarns again  to life-but with new force and relevance for grown-up managers. <br />The book  is the brainchild of Gloria Gilbert Mayer and Thomas Mayer, avid fairy tale  fans with thriving careers as consultants. During their three decades of  involvement in management, the Mayers watched many trends come and go. They  also came to a startling realization: the best business practices reflect  time-honored principles-in fact, the very stuff of classic children's  stories. <br />&quot;Fairy tales offer us fundamental truths that have  persisted across generations,&quot; the Mayers point out. &quot;They are  simple, direct, fun, and enduring.&quot;<br />Liberally sprinkled with  whimsical line drawings, Goldilocks On Management revisits 27 enchanting  stories we all know and love. Without sacrificing the cherished staples,  the Mayers tell each tale with a distinctive twist to make it more adult,  entertaining, and reflective of today's on-the-job realities. (For example,  Goldilocks is recast as &quot;a highly compensated professional woman with  a serious attitude problem.&quot;) <br />But this fairy tale collection is no  mere humorous parody. The &quot;moral&quot; of each story is crystallized  as a one-line basic business lesson. Each yarn is accompanied by an  in-depth discussion of its applications for serious managers. And every  imaginative tale is complemented by a parallel real-world business  example-a contemporary case study with striking similarities to the  storybook fiction. <br />A wonderfully playful resource packed with thoughtful  insights and practical strategies, Goldilocks on Management takes a fresh  and winning approach to excelling in the big bad world of business.  <br />Gloria Gilbert Mayer and Thomas Mayer are corporate consultants,  speakers, and writers specializing in issues of concern to health care  professionals. They have collaborated on numerous articles, as well as a  consumer's guide to HMOs, The Health Insurance Alternative. This book was  inspired by their mutual love for classic children's stories and a lesson  reinforced throughout their three decades in management. Gloria holds a  Doctorate in Education from Columbia University. Tom holds an MBA from the  University of Phoenix, and is also board-certified in Family Practice from  Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.<br />Reviewed by Azlan  Adnan, Managing Partner of Azlan &amp; Koh Knowledge and Professional  Management Group, an education and management consulting practice based in  Kota Kinabalu.

The trade-off used to be simple but absolute: your business strategy either could be focus on &quot;rich&quot; information-customized products and services tailored to a niche  audience-or could reach out to a larger market, but with watered-down  information that sacrificed richness in favour of a broad, general appeal.  Much of business strategy as we know it today rests on this fundamental  dilemma.<br />Now, say Evans and Wurster, the new economics of information is  eliminating the trade off between richness and reach, blowing apart the  foundations of traditional business strategy. Blown to Bits reveals how the  spread of connectivity and common standards is redefining the information  channels that link businesses with their customers, suppliers, and  employees. Increasingly, your customers will have rich access to a universe  of alternatives, your suppliers will exploit direct access to your  customers, and your competitors will pick off the most profitable parts of  your value chain. Your competitive advantage is up for grabs.<br />To prepare  corporate executives and entrepreneurs alike for a fundamental change in  business competition, Evans and Wurster expand and illuminate  groundbreaking concepts first explored in their award-winning Harvard  Business Review article &quot;Strategy and the New Economics of  Information&quot;, and present a practical guide for applying  them.<br />Examples span the spectrum of industries-from financial services to  health care, from consumer to industrial goods, and from media to  retailing. Blown to Bits shows how to build new strategies that reflect a  world in which richness and reach go hand in hand and how to make the most  of the new forces shaping competitive advantage.<br />Philip Evans is a Senior  Vice President of The Boston Consulting Group.

What role should government play in regulating the environment? Will &quot;clean technology&quot; lay the foundation for a sustainable future? To help students understand the  far-reaching implications of environmental and resource economics, this  text examines a broad range of topics in environmental economics. It  presents &quot;standard analysis,&quot; as well as in-depth treatment of  important issues at the cutting edge of environmental policy debates. The  focus is on equipping students with the tools necessary to analyze current  environmental issues as an economist would.<br />In keeping with the  philosophy of incorporating examples directly in the text, this book begins  with a detailed case study of a &quot;big issue&quot; with which many  students are familiar-global warming. Other issues covered in a rigorous  and comprehensive manner include the property-rights basis of environmental  problems, benefit estimation techniques and benefit-cost analysis,  incentive-based regulation, and sustainable resource use.<br />The Second  Edition retains the three interrelated advantages of its predecessor-(1)  broad content, (2) pedagogical clarity, and (3) timely, well-integrated  examples-while incorporating major reorganizations, additions and updates  aimed at enhancing learning and reflecting the most up-to-date information  available. Following the Introduction, this text centres around four  focussed questions:<br />Part I: How Much Pollution is Enough? Part II: Is  Government Up to the Job? Part III: How Can We Do Better? Part IV: Can We  Resolve Global Issues?<br />Using these questions as guidelines, the author  develops the economic tools students need to explore solutions to  environmental problems. In the process, the book covers a wealth of current  examples, from global warming, to population growth, to urban air pollution  and energy policy, to chemical regulation and landfill siting.<br />Part V  covers four advanced topics: The Importance of Being Convex, Imperfect  Regulation in an Uncertain World, Input-Output Models and Life-Cycle  Analysis and Incentive-Compatible Regulation.<br />As this text addresses  important questions raised in contemporary (and future) society and  introduces readers to the economist's view of some solutions, it is highly  recommended for students taking courses in environment management,  environmental and resource economics, and environmental studies. Ideally,  students would have undertaken a course in microeconomics or intermediate  microeconomics as a prerequisite.<br />Formerly a Research Officer with the  Malaysian Timber Council's London office and Business Development Manager  with KPMG's Kuala Lumpur office, Azlan Adnan is currently Managing Partner  of Azlan &amp; Koh Knowledge and Professional Management Group, an  education and management consulting practice based in Kota Kinabalu.

Over this period the medium has expanded its capabilities in the recording of time and space, allowing us to capture the fleeting moment and to visualize both the vast and the microscopic. It has  brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the  solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life.  Indeed, the photographic medium has provided one of the most influential  means of depicting the human predicament. In bringing about the media  culture that characterizes modern life, photography has also brought the  harsh realities of the world onto the coffee-table in our cozy  homes.<br />Photography has provided a system of visual presentation that has  both generated and promoted the social, political, economic, scientific and  artistic developments of the past century and a half. The persuasive use of  photography in advertising has evolved to perpetuate the consumer society  of the post-industrial era. The true value of photography's  representational powers lies as much in the image's historical and cultural  contexts as in any inherent properties of the photographic medium itself.  Thus, looking at a photograph and obtaining information from it is not as  straightforward as we might have first thought.<br />This handbook is not an  introductory photographic textbook and does not cover specific details of  photographic techniques or technical theory such as darkroom practice and  how to use a camera. Instead, it introduces the principles of photography  enabling the reader not only to gain a sound theoretical background, but  also to develop a critical approach to the field of photographic  practice.<br />Chapter 1 examines the historical context and visual tradition  that gave rise to the photographic phenomenon, elucidating both the  historical background and the rationale for photographic representation,  establishing a theoretical framework. Chapter 2 considers the  pre-production factors in approaching the photographic shoot, discussing  conceptual photographic skills in terms of Realist, Formalist and  Expressionist Aesthetics. Chapter 3 examines the character and nature of  the photographic image, while Chapter 4 explores the scope and limitations  of the post-production process. Chapter 5 looks at the use of the camera as  a documentary tool while Chapter 6 views photography as a medium of  expression. Chapter 7 describes the current impact of new technologies on  photographic practice whilst the final chapter is devoted to the  digitalization of the photographic image and its future significance for  photography.<br />In providing guidelines for the systematic study of  photographic media, this handbook would be of interest to practitioners,  theorists, students and scholars of photography, media studies,  communications and the visual arts.<br />A former professional photographer,  Terence Wright is currently Associate Fellow of the Reuter Programme at  Oxford University.

Of course this new imperative has considerable  implications for trainers who are now playing an increasingly critical role  in supporting individuals, teams and business management. In this respect  today's trainers may need to be more than excellent presenters; they are  also likely to require a range of consultancy and coaching skills, to  understand the place of technology in supporting learning and be able to  align personal development values with business objectives.<br />This brand  new edition of the Gower Handbook of Training and Development will be an  invaluable aid for today's training professionals as they face up to the  organizational challenges presented to them.

The secrets of its success were often a subject of intense debate. Plaudits cited Japanese economic power, Confucian work ethics, the freeing of China's markets, Eastern ingenuity and the powerful overseas Chinese  guanxi networks. Critics were dismissed as ignorant of Asian values. <br />But  behind the faÃ§ade lay a darker, more sinister truth. This remarkable  account tears away the myths of Asian business and reveals the dark side of  the Asian success story. The recent downturn in the Asian economies has  been blamed on a number of factors. This controversial, eye-opening book  analyzes a number of dubious business practices that are endemic in the  region and which the author believes have played a significant part in  Asia's economic downfall. Along with an in-depth examination of such  troubling symptoms as widespread cronyism and inadequate legal protection,  Asian Eclipse includes chapters on the unique business environments of  Japan, China, and Indonesia.<br />Of particular interest to Malaysians are the  whole sections devoted to &quot;The Mahathir Family in Business&quot; (pp  304-311), &quot;Sarawak Incorporated&quot; (pp 311-314), and  &quot;Malaysia's Ekran Group&quot; (pp 120-124).<br />From endemic corruption  to rampant cronyism, Asian Eclipse is a tale of capitalism gone sour, it  names the perpetrators and offers timely advice on what is really needed  for Asia to clean up its act. With its lucid explanations on how outside  investors should approach the new Asian markets, it will remain an  indispensable guide to the complexities of corporate Asia for years to  come.<br />Australian Michael Backman is a leading commentator on corporate  Asia, regularly contributing to the Asian Wall Street Journal.

It not only provides a comprehensive account of the history of electronic communications from telegraphy to the Internet, but  also offers a model with which to understand the processes of change in the  technologies of communication.<br />The purpose of book is not only to  explicate a fuller account of what actually occurred in the  telecommunications past but also to offer an interpretation, necessarily  synthetic and revisionist, of those occurrences. The model offers an  understanding of the history and the current position of communications in  our culture. This understanding is not solely dependent on the performance  of technology, but is also heavily dependent on an examination of the  operation of the social necessities and constraints.<br />Brian Winston's  fascinating account challenges the popular myth of a present-day  `information revolution' in communications technology by highlighting the  long histories of such developments. The fax was introduced in 1884.  Digitalization was demonstrated in 1938. Even the concept of the `web'  dates back to 1945.<br />In Part I, the author applies the model to the  electrical systems of communication, the telegraph and the telephone. Then,  in Part II, radio and television are dealt with. Part III is concerned with  computing while Part IV looks at the whole development of electrical and  electronic networks from the telegraph to the Internet. The conclusion  suggestions, via a consideration of the current state of research into  holography, that the model is still valid.<br />This book is essential reading  for anyone interested in the social impact of technological change.<br />Brian  Winston is Head of the School of Communication, Design and Media at the  University of Westminster, the world's leading school of media and  communication studies.

Straight from the CEO is a major work, because the world rarely hears directly from the great contemporary business  leaders-the chief movers and shakers of major corporations. Working closely  with the Price Waterhouse management team, a wide variety of chief  executives who are successfully managing today's rapid pace of economic  change present their ideas about leading and motivating people, unleashing  innovation and creativity, and learning from customers to revitalize their  businesses. Among the CEOs represented in the book are the heads of British  Airways, Compaq Computer, Monsanto, Royal Dutch/Shell, Enron, Chase  Manhattan Bank, and Warner-Lambert. The scope is worldwide: from Bangkok to  Jakarta, from Dusseldorf to Dallas. No ivory tower theorizing, no speeches,  no &quot;consultant speak,&quot; these are the practical insights of  leaders who every day must find ways to test and validate new ideas,  implement change to improve the bottom line, and ultimately focus on the  core ideas that will truly reshape their corporation. <br />Straight from the  CEO is an important tool for managers at every level, focusing on such  issues as creating loyalty to customers, organizing globally, fostering  individual employee motivation, and leveraging corporate values to enhance  performance. These are the pressing issues that face every manager who  strives to sort out valuable contributions from impractical ideas, the gold  from the dross, and then take action that gets results. As intellectually  stimulating as it is practical, Straight from the CEO is an invaluable  report from the executive trenches. <br />By necessity brief, the many pieces  (I hesitate to call them chapters or even articles) lack depth, assume much  and as a result are quite unstatisfying; but they do leave the reader  hungryfor more!<br />William Dauphinais is Vice Chairman, Human Capital for  PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Either employees don't have a clear understanding of their duties and responsibilities, spending time and energy disentangling them  from those of their colleagues, or they are hemmed in by job descriptions  that allow no room for movement and initiative.<br />In Changing The Way We  Work, Belbin proposes Workset, an alternative system where jobs can grow  and develop: where communication about the work can flow up as easily as  down. It is a radical approach, incorporating colour-coding and information  technology, as a new means of delivering greater efficiency in a dynamic  process that equally involves managers and their employees.<br />This book  would be of interest to human resource managers and academics specialising  in organisational behaviour and development.<br />Born in 1926, Dr Raymond  Meredith Belbin is regarded as the father of team-role theory.

Nordstrom's culture encourages entrepreneurial motivated men and  women to make the extra effort to give customer service that is unrivalled  in American retailing.<br />At the end of each of the eight chapters is a  useful Keys To Success section which summarises the key principles of  Nordstrom success discussed in the chapter.<br />Robert Spector is a Seattle  based freelance journalist who has covered Nordstrom since 1982 for a  variety of publications.
