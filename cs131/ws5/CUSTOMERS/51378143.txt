What this study does is focus on the subject.  We spend the time on the study part and that gives us more time to spend on our fellowship and prayer portions.  It is not that we don't want to spend more time studying, but that with our schedules, we only have a limited time for it with each other.  I would recommend this for a good study with the people wanting to have a varied time together, studying, praying, fellowshipping.  A great tool.	2002-07-23
US	51378143	R1BCR8AZ3G2NZT	0736900233	581071525	The New Inductive Study Bible (International Inductive Study Series)	Books	5	40	42	N	N	Just God and you	I have several study Bibles for various reasons.  The best that I have for me to learn the Bible with is this one.  The approach is the best that I have found.  One of the things that I was told by my brother, Wally, when I got my first study Bible was to remember that the comments were from men and therefore open to error.  With The New Inductive Study Bible, there are no comments from men.  There is only the Word of God.  Therefore, no error.  This Bible has you and God get the meaning together.  And I mean God.  There is no way to understand the Bible without God.  Kay Arthur stresses that point also.  The beginning section of this Bible is about the Inductive Study method.  She explains to you what it is and how it works.  The process is also called &quot;exegesis&quot;, which means &quot;to draw out&quot;.  With this method, you are drawing out the meaning of the passage.  You are not being told what it means.  She also shows you some ways to mark your Bible to help you get the meaning better.  (I thought that I would be hit with lightning the first time I marked in my Bible.)  She shows you a couple of methods of doing so from a sample passage of the Bible in this section with the marks on the passage.  She carefully walks you through the Inductive Study method and what each part is.  The next section is a brief overview of Israel's spirtual life.  This helps you to understand what is going on.  She also shows you the Tabernacle and the two Temples.  There is also a timeline included.  The Bible portion has an introduction to each book of the Bible.  This gives you information about the author (if known), date, some historical background and such.  At the end of each book is a chart for you to put the chapter themes, the book's theme and the key words to look for.  This Bible has wide margins to make notes in and the pages are thicker than onion skin.  This is good because your pen (and use only a ball point pen) doesn't bleed through.  There is also a centercolumn cross-reference that also has alternate meanings of words or the literal translation of words.  The only thing that I didn't like was not having Jesus' words in red.  But then that would detract from the Inductive Study method.  The &quot;Helps&quot; section at the back is very helpful.  There are some historical articles, grammatical articles, maps (and maps and charts in the Bible portion itself also) and much more.  And there is a concordance.  All in all, for really learning God's Word and making it a part of you, I have not found a better Bible.  As I said, I have several study Bibles and have found this to be the best for getting the Word of God into me.  The other study Bibles that I have are good for what I bought them for.  But I have found no better Bible for getting it to be God teaching me His Word.	2002-07-23
US	51378143	R2CL31UGN23PM9	0736905448	989539990	How to Study Your Bible: The Lasting Rewards of the Inductive Method	Books	5	14	15	N	N	Learning to get to the meat	Kay Arthur has a very good way to help you study your Bible.  She does not walk you through what passages mean.  She shows you how to get the meaning out of the passage.  This is the best way to study the Bible.  It is called the Inductive method because you must use inductive reasoning to interpret the part of the Bible that you are studying.  She shows you how to interpret the passage in context and her method(s) of marking your Bible are very good.  And again to stress a point, she underscores keeping the passage(s) in context, not pulling any one passage out and making the interpretation.  If you want to know for yourself what the Bible is saying, GET THIS BOOK!!  It is better to study this way and then go to commentaries than the other way around.  Using her method, you will know for yourself what God is saying.  This method is you drawing the meaning out of the Bible, rather than reading a meaning into the Bible.  She walks you through the Inductive Study Method step by step starting from the very basic.  Her style of writing is easy to understand.  The method that she shows you is also easily adaptable to your preferences.<br />I heartily recommend this book for any student of the Bible, no matter what level.  If you would like to get God's Word into your heart, get this book.  You will not be sorry that you did.  You will probably wish, like I did, that you had gotten this book years ago.	2002-07-09

Mrs. Traylor brings him out of the Bible and into your home.  Even though this book can stand alone, I would recommend that you read it as a sequel to &quot;Noah&quot; (ISBN: 0970027419).  One of the things that I admire about Mrs. Traylor is her research.  And you can tell that she has done a lot of research on him from how well the story flows together.  This book is also a great lead in to her book &quot;Abraham&quot; (ISBN: 0842359753).  But be prepared, no matter if you read this book as a stand alone or with the others, to be entranced, entertained and to enjoy this book and to be saying, &quot;HHMMMMM&quot; a lot.  I have read this book several times and have enjoyed it each and every time.  Along with always finding new &quot;stuff&quot; in it.  For anyone, Christian or not, I would recommend this book.	2002-07-05

I have found it to be an excellent resource, for the beginning draftsman, for putting together a set of plans.  For the intermediate and advanced draftsman it is a valuable &quot;checklist&quot; book.  The book only has one small section on CAD, but that is not the idea of the book.<br />  This book will show you what is needed to be in a good set of plans.  It has many examples of drawings and details and with good explanations for them.  The explanations given also help you to understand what is being shown, but also why it is being shown.  Having been in construction for over 20 years before I started drafting, I can say that the examples given are the types of drawings I wish came out to my jobs.  You will be able to understand what information needs to be in your drawings, how to graphically show it.  You will also be able to move around in the book and go to examples for whichever phase you are working on in your drawings and compare what you have done with what is given in the book.<BR> <BR>  No matter what level of draftsman you are, I would recommend this book.  It will be an invaluable resource for you for years to come.	2002-07-05

She brings in history from the area and accounts that we have from outside of the Bible and keeps them in accord with the Bible.  She is an author that digs into the past of the area and gives you a story that keeps you interested.  Reading Mrs. Traylor's books are always enjoyable and this book is no exception to that.  I had a very hard time putting the book down.  If you want a Christian fiction that is faithful to the Bible and history and keeps your interest up, get this one.  A good read.	2002-05-17

This book helps to make the learning curve not quite so steep.  It is laid out like the other &quot;Quick Reference&quot; books for ACAD, in alphabetical order, with numeric commands (usually 3d) after 'Z'<br />When you get to the command that you have a question about, there is a wealth of information.  You not only have the command, but the icon also, if there is one for that command.  You then get the command line reference, and a picture of the dialog box (again, if there is one with that command)  In the command line feature, you also get the way to type the command, with a hyphen, to use the command in the command line only.  You also get a brief description of options, related commands, system(s) variables, and quite a set of tips.  They also tell you if a command has been renamed or is an undocumented, by AutoDesk, command.<br />All in all, you get very good information for a basic grasp of the command.  This will make it easier for you when you go to more in depth resources for AutoCad.<br />Some other good features of the book are: 1) pictures of the function key and their functions on the inside cover, as well as some of the Control key combinations, 2) Command prefixes on the inside front cover, 3) 29 pages of system variables, 4) Commands that have been removed, and 5)some miscellaneous information on the inside back cover.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that is now using AutoCad 2002.  I would also suggest that anyone thinking of purchasing AutoCad 2002 to pick it up and see what it has to offer.	2002-03-19

I was constantly looking at the clock saying, &quot;Just a half hour more.&quot;  Ellen Gunderson Traylor has a way of taking a person from the Bible and bring them into your home.  I could see the scenes in my mind, that is how good the writing is.  I was inspired by this book.  She brought to me the story of Mark, cousin of one the beginning giants of the Church, and helped me to see that it could be my story.  I went back to the Bible and read again the part in Acts about Mark leaving Paul &amp; Barnabas, Paul &amp; Barnabas going seperate ways because of it, and then, in his 2nd letter to Timothy, Paul asking for Mark to come to him because he is a comfort to Paul.  If God can work in his life, Mrs. Traylor helped me to see that He could and wants to work in my life.  Mark is a novel that kept me turning pages.  After reading so many of her works, I have faith in her faithfulness to the Scriptures.  She is also faithful to the cultures of the characters she writes about.  Many times I have come across references in her books that have been verified by other resources.  The same is true of Mark.  Get this book and sit back and let her tell you an amazing story.  I think that you will be inspired by it like I was.	2002-03-07

I have found them to be very enjoyable reading and this book is no different.  I am the type of person that always wants to know the whole story and this book does that.  I have always wondered why Jerle Shannara wasn't able to destroy Brona since I firs read &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; back in the 70's.  The &quot;First King of Shannara&quot; fills in a lot of the background.  If you enjoy the Shannara books, you will enjoy this one also.  I do recommend this book for all Shannara fans.	2001-12-18

This book has made it easier for me and my company.  As a CAD company, we need to stay on top of it.  Mr. Aubin's book has been a great aid in that.  You really need to go through the first section, but then you can go to the part of the book that deals with what you are working on in your project.  The exercises that are in the book are easy to understand and thorough in their coverage of the topic.  The drawings that come with the book are excellent.  And the exercises deal with both residential and commercial projects with drawings for each type.  One of the great pluses of these drawings are that you do not have to keep building from the first one to the last.  Each section has an updated drawing for you to use so that you can concentrate on the topic that you are working on.  There is also a completed drawing for you to reference and see the finished result.  I created a seperate sub-directory for my exercises.  This way, I can keep the original drawings intact and use them again, in case I need to start over or want to try again.  I also open both the exercise drawing for the topic that I am working on as well as the project that I am working on at the time.  This has been a great help in getting my drawings to be correct and so that I get the finished project done correctly.<br />If you have no other reference book on ADT R3 or R3.3, get this one.  You will have it broke in and dog-eared in no time at all.  I made sure that everyone in my firm has one, as well as the architects that I work with.	2001-11-14

Ms. Traylor warned you from the very beginning how she went about putting this book together.  She brought the Bible, ancient myths &amp; legends, and research, among other things together for it.  Not only was the book just fascinating reading, it makes you go; &quot;HHMMMM.  Could this be close to true?&quot;  She did not contradict anything that the Bible says, (she never does) what she did is thoughtfully and delightfully filled in a picture.  This is one book that should be passed around, it is that enjoyable for reading.<br />If you like a good fiction that makes you wonder about possibilities, get this one.	2001-10-14

When I read Christian fiction, I keep in mind what the Bible has said about the subject of the fiction I am reading.  Ellen Gunderson Traylor keeps the Bible in mind when she writes her books.  She brought Mary Magdalene into my reading room in a very real manner.  It is not only enjoyable to read this book, but you come away from the book feeling that you not only know Mary Magdalene better, you can actually feel the thankfulness that she has for God's grace.  Mrs. Traylor has taken one of the most talked about people in the Bible and brought her into your living room.  I had to really ration the time that I spent reading this book because I did not want to put it down.  I wanted to read it from cover to cover in one sitting.  Too bad that I had work that I had to do because I would have not put this book down.  If you enjoy Christian fiction, I would heartily recommend this book!	2001-08-12

She makes it very easy to visualize the story line.  She takes the Bible and, with her style of writing, puts you right into the life of the character.  I thoroughly enjoyed her novel about Joshua.  You can easily picture his training from her descriptions.  Not only does Joshua come to life in your home, but so do the other other characters, namely Moses.  (I will definitely search to find her book on Moses.)  If you would like to have a good book to relax with, get this one.  I enjoy it every time I read it and am constantly getting more out of it each time.  I have a hard time lending her books out, I enjoy them that much.  I don't really want to take the chance on them not coming back to me.  If you enjoy Christian fiction, get this book of hers, and any others that you can.	2001-07-24

In the western world, names are not as significant as they are in the middle eastern culture.  Consequently, names don't mean as much to us as they possibly should.<br />This study takes you through, not only the names that God has been given by Himself and others, but WHY those particular names are used.  Kay Arthur's books do not just tell you why, she has questions that are designed for you to go and learn for yourself.  This is a great study method for both individual and group study.  This way the knowledge actually becomes part of you.  For the beginning Christian, this study helps you to learn more of God, His faithfulness, His characteristics, and such.  This makes your personal relationship with Him all the richer.  This also holds true for the more mature Christian.  This is a study that does take some time, thought, research, and reading.  But the most important part of this study (and any study that a Christian does) is prayer.  Then you are inviting God to make Himself better known to you.<br />This study does take a commitment of time and energy.  If you are looking for a study that makes you dig into your Bible in a deeper manner, get this one.  You will be richly rewarded for the effort that you put into it.  By the time that you are prayerfully done, God will be even more personal to you.  Christ's words of John 15:15, &quot;...I call you friends.&quot; will be even more of a reality of your life with Him.	2001-05-21

It helps you with your Biblical study of your new life.  If you are a more mature Christian, this book helps you keep the simplicity of the Christian faith in mind.  When you speak with people about our Lord, have this book readily available.  It will not do the speaking for you, but will help you to express what the Bible says if you happen to need some help.  And I have needed this type of help from time to time.  If you are wanting to know what Christianity is about and don't want to go through the Bible yet or talk with a Christian, this book will help you to see what it is that we believe.<br />I had a hard time putting this book down.  I keep saying that I would put it down after I finish &quot;just this one part&quot;.  It helped me to get back to the basics of my belief.  I was able to read the Bible with fresh eyes again.  A wonderful book to read and great resource to have.

I have found that this book is a great resource to help me have a ready explanation for the Hope that we have in the Lord.  The topics are very informative, but they are not overpowering.  With this resource you are able to look up a topic quickly so that we can share our promises from our Lord quickly and accurately.  I would recommend this book to ANYONE that speaks of our Lord to others.  You don't need to be a &quot;full-time evangelist&quot; to find this book helpful.  This book helps you to speak of the Lord from whatever starting point the person you are talking with is at (see how Phillip did it with the Ethiopian).  If you would like to have accurate information about Christianity at your fingerips, this is a great book to have.  When you read it, I would recommend that you look up the Bible references that are in it.  This book is a great help.  Remember that it does not replace the Bible.  The Bible was written by God and this was written by men.  But I would strongly suggest for any Christian to have this book to help find the information that you would like to share.

Since becoming a Christian a few years back, I have tried to share our hope with those outside of Christ.  This book has helped me see more ways to reach people.  I read the book through in the first reading and then went back through it again.  I did so, so that I could spend the time to look up the Scripture references and read them in context.  I find that this is an essential part of any study of the Bible that you undertake.  I was impressed with the way that the interpretation kept within the context of the passage.  It took me extra time to do so, but, I feel that this is what is needed for evangelism so that we will always be able to explain the passages to those that are searching.  I would recommend this book as a great tool to use when you talk with someone about Christ and about the promises that we are given.  You are able to show God's love for us by showing not only what He has done in the past, but what He is going to do on our behalf in this present age and in the age to come.

For any Christian, this is a book to read and be encouraged.  It will help sustain you when the times get rough by helping to keep your eye on the prize at the end of the race.  For the non-Christian, this book will help you see the promises that God gives to us through His Son.<br />I have gone through the book a few times now and still find new information about my home in the Scripture passages.  It is not only an encouraging book to read for the Christian, it is also a helpful tool with evangelism.  You don't have to pound doors to evangelize, you do so with your life.  When people ask you about your hope, you can use the information in this book to tell people about the home that you will be going to and, with the Lord's help, this could set a spark off in their heart to know more.<br />I am glad that I got this book.

The program is so versatile that it is impossible to remember all the commands.  This book sits right next to my monitor and I use it probably 3 or 4 times a week.   Some great features are that it:  1) shows you the button for the command,  2)  gives you commands that are related, 3)  gives you tips for the  command, 4) the alias for the command, and much more.  I am able to be that  much more productive and accurate, which are the reasons behind computer  drafting.  I would recommend this book for every AutoCad 2000 user,  beginner or advanced.	2000-07-26

I have never been able to put them down once I got my hands on them.  I have been re-reading them when a new one is going to be coming out.  Even then, I find it hard to put them  down.<br />I was looking forward to this book because I was wondering how this  was going to be pulled off.  That is a sign of a good book, and a good  series, you can't wait to find out.  There is a part of me that hopes that  Christ will Rapture us after this series is ended, but not to big a  part.<br />I have read Revelation several times and enjoy this series, and  this book, because it is nice to see if it matches the visualization that  you have.  The authors have brought amazing imagery to the book.  It is an  amazing fill-in, granted that it IS fiction, for the &quot;holes&quot; that  some of us, me included, would like to see.  I would recommend this book to  anyone.  I would caution them to start at the beginning of the series or  they will not catch a lot of the story, but that is natural for series  books.	2000-06-26
US	51378143	R1HCY0AEJFHCOP	0891073906	145017176	This Present Darkness	Books	5	1	3	N	N	A Keeper for the library	I have read and reread this book often.  It is the first book that I have read that dealt with spiritual warfare.  I looked for references to this warfare in the Bible and found that there is a solid Biblical base for this  story.  Mr. Peretti takes the reality of spiritual warfare and comes up  with a gripping story from it. It in an entertaining book and one that I  always find hard to put down, even after all the times that I have reread  it. Mr. Peretti is a very gifted writer.  He makes the story so real that  it is hard to NOT come up with the images from his work.  I love this book  immensely and have no problem recommending it to anyone.  Even if they are  not Christian or if they do not think that spiritual warfare is real.  This  one is a keeper for anyone's library.	2000-06-18

It is just as hard to put this book down as the first of the two was.  Mr. Peretti's writing is so gifted that I am  able to come up with the people, scenes, etc. from the story.  I have this  one in my library and this is one of the ones that I take with me when I go  on trips.  I cannot get enough of this book and &quot;This Present  Darkness&quot;.  I will enjoy this book for as long as I can read it.	2000-06-18

I read the book through and only put it down with great reluctance.  Mr. Keller took one of the most beloved of Psalms and made it  so that I was not only able to understand it better, but I could see the  &quot;subtle colors&quot; in it.  I not only love this Psalm for why I  first read it, I can see more of the background to the picture that God was  painting for us through David's hand.  I would not only recommend this book  for ANYONE, I have bought copies of it to use for presents.  If you read  it, you will be happy to pass it out to someone that you love. Mr. Keller  has written in such a style that you will enjoy reading his book and then  go back into your Bible and read what the Lord has written for us with a  lot more joy in your heart for His provision.	2000-05-07

I am almost constantly thinking of ways that I could get my ACAD 2000 program to work better with me.  This book is  extremely helpful for me to do that.  I have found this book to be laid out  well and has a VERY extensive index so that I can find out how to do what I  want to do.  I recommend very strongly that anyone that uses ACAD 2000 on a  regular basis to have this book in their library and within reach.	2000-05-07

I am always using it and recommending it.  The book is laid out so that you can go from beginning drafting up through advanced.  It not only says what the  standards are, but walks you through drafting technology so that you  understand why they are like they are.  I believe that anyone that is going  to be doing drafting should have this in their library.	2000-05-07

This book is one reason why.  It takes you out into the world of nature and relates God's Word to us with amazing imagery.  I especially loved three sections.  One  is &quot;Sky Edge&quot; because it spoke of God to me through the mountains  that I love so well.  From his writing, I could see that Mr. Keller loved  them as well.  The second section is called &quot;As a Tree Grows&quot;.   Mr. Keller shows us a Christian's spiritual growth through the giant cedars  of Lebanon.  I have not been able to think of trees in the same manner  after reading this.  The other section that is close to my heart is called  &quot;Still Waters&quot;.  I had no trouble putting myself into the scenery  that Mr. Keller described with such vivid descriptions.  The other section,  &quot;Sea Edge&quot; was also written with clear imagery for the reader.  I  just don't love the sea as much as I do the woods and mountains. I am  always able to pick this book up, read it again and still get something new  from it.  I never have trouble picking this book up for a few minutes.  The  problem comes when I need to lay it down for a while, I don't want to quit  reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone at all!	2000-03-20

It takes you from starting out on the banjo, like learning which string is what, and brings you up to playing with confidence.  It also helps you to have fun not only  with the banjo, but also with other musicians.  This book not only deals  with how to play the banjo, but also takes you through some of the history  of it.  This book also shows you how to make your own banjo.  This gives  you even more insight for your playing.  This is truly one of the GREAT  books of the 5 string banjo.  I heartily recommend it for anyone that wants  not only to learn to play the banjo, but also for anyone that wants to  learn about this great American instrument.	2000-03-17

I use it in the areas of prayer for: elders and ministers, petitions, personal and many others.  I have found this book to be extremely useful for this.  It gives  you not only basic help for how to do this type of prayer, it also gives  you Scriptural backing for why.  It also underscores how important prayer  is in the life of the Christian.  The book also gives some guidelines on  how to do warfare prayer, if you should be doing warfare and other such  topics.  I would recommend this book for anyone that is interested in doing  warfare prayer and would also recommend it to congregations as a tool for  having warfare prayer as part of their prayer ministry.	2000-02-25

He takes his usual everyday situations and shows how the Lord's Word relates to it.  His illustraions are powerful and easy to understand  and relate to.

I enjoyed this book tremendously because it was a thoughtful dramatization.  I have always wondered, &quot;what about&quot; or &quot;what if&quot; of  some of my favorite people of the Bible.  Ms. Traylor brings a story out of  our Biblical accounts of John and gives him a plausible history.  One of  the great products of this book, for me, has been the ideas that make me  dig even deeper into the Bible to understand what it is that God has said  that make this story sound &quot;real&quot;.  I would easily recommend this  book for anyone that would like to have some enjoyable time with a good  book.	1999-12-13

It is very common for Jehovah's Witnesses to come to the door.  This book is a great tool to show them the TRUE Jesus Christ of the Bible.  I appreciate the  advice that he has in the beginning of his book.  This advice stresses to  talk WITH the Jehovah's Witness and NOT at them.  It is also stressed that  you should get to know them as people.  With those attitudes and the  information contained in this book, you should be able to have a fruitful  witness opportunity.  If they are sincerely honest about knowing God, the  material contained in this volume will help you with providing information  on the TRUE Jesus Christ of the Bible.   The majority of the book shows the  Watchtower doctrine and the Scriptures that they use to support them.  Mr.  Rhodes then goes through the texts that they use.  He supplies not only the  word(s) in the original language with documented defintions, he also  supplies supporting text.  This is done on the principal that Scripture  should interpret Scripture. I would recommend that this book be in your  library and the information on the tip of your tongue.  This will help to  supply a ready defense for the faith.	1999-08-11

The movements that are now present in society, New Age and others, are shown  how they are not only against what the Holy Scriptures say, but they are  also shown on how they are dangerous to us, as Christians and as a society.

It does stress to talk WITH the Mormon and NOT at them, find out what THEY believe.  The book then goes into the Mormon scriptures used and the quotes  from the Bible that Mormon authorities use.  The second half of the section  is not only a refutation of these but also filled with other Holy  Scriptures that support the position of Christianity.
