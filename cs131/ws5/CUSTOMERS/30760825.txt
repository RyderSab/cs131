Having LOVED the first three novels I was so dissapointed by \\"Drums of Autumn\\" that it took me 3 years to finally try reading this novel. Also, as I had NO expectations for this novel, I'm not sure I can judge it fairly. It was nice to read about these characters again, at least it reminded me how much I'd liked the first three. *smile*<br /><br />My sister asked me what the plot of this novel was (when I was on page 400 and something out of the 1000 pages) and I honestly couldn't tell her. The characters went from event to event for no greater purpose than to pass the time, it seemed to me. Basically everyone was waiting for 1776 and the revolution (but, as this novel ended in 1772, there's more waiting instore in the sequal, I imagine). Stephen Bonnett was a plot line that showed up every 200 pages or so, so I guess that was the plot arc, but it's pretty weak.<br /><br />I remember noticing how completely UN-invested I was in these characters' lives. I don't know if this is because of poor writing/weak character development/lame plots or because \\"Drums of Autumn\\" ruined it for me completely...but I think it was a combination of the two. I remember thinking to myself, at one supposedly highly-tense and emotional scene (all the problems between Claire and Jamie because of Phillip Wylie at Jocasta's wedding), \\"Wow. This is supposed to be tense and sad and emotional and i couldn't care less.\\" That thought made me sad, as I had been so emotionally and mentally wrapped up in the first three.<br /><br />Another thing that seems lame to me is the continued learning about \\"time travel.\\" I thought it worked brilliantly as this phenomenon tied into all the celtic legends. But now they keep finding artifacts of others who have \\"traveled\\" and they're learning all these \\"rules about time travel\\" (using gemstones, etc). Boo!!<br /><br />Oh well. I read it. It passed the time. I smiled at the sometimes witty dialogue. Oh, one more RANT. The character of Roger seems to have been invented solely for the purpose of tormenting him. Lord. From hangings to forest fires to all sorts of horrible things, this guy just gets beat on A LOT. Yet, his character is weakly developed. We don't really see anything interesting happen until after the battle of Alamance and that is sad-interesting.<br /><br />I'll be keeping this book, just cuz I've got the others on my shelf.iled at the sometimes witty dialogue.

And what a delightful surprise to find recipes scattered throughout. I must say that reading this book made me very hungry (even if it's not making me want to sail around the world...I'm all for world travel, but I'm not very comfortable on sailboats)<br /><br />This was such a wonderful adventure. Vanderhoof's writing is pleasant, evocative, unexpected, comforting...it was just the right feel for this story. And, seriously, these people did this trip up right. Woot!! Let's here it for having REAL vacation experiences and meeting real people...not hiding in a steralized resort in some disneyfied island. It was great getting to take this trip (without having to take this trip). I've photocopied almost every recipe from the book (Except the conch recipes...I don't feel familiar enough with this seafood in order to attempt cooking it). I made the chicken with fresh cheese and avacado last night and it was DIVINE. Yum. We're making the Coo-coo polenta dish tonight and plan to try the Bahamian Mac & Cheese next week. Also, the rum punch recipe will make an appearance at saturday's party.<br /><br />Not only is this a great read, but it's full of great food too.	2005-09-21

I've only read one other Bradley romance and don't remember much, other than that I was impressed that her heroine was more than just a brainless ninny.<br /><br />I found the character of Willa to be so utterly enchanting. I laughed out loud many, many times while reading this novel. It was the perfect companion while stuck at home, ill in bed...even if the laughing out loud did sometimes bring on a coughing fit. While the novel's most basic plot (wounded man healed by love of a good woman) is pretty common, I find that some type of barebones plot is shared by almost all romances (perhaps one of the reasons i don't read them so much). However, i thought Bradley's dialogue was thoroughly engaging, and her characters were very amusing. Highly enjoyable mind candy.	2005-09-21

A well-crafted world with interesting and complex characters. Tynan's spirit-link was fascinating, and Cat's contributions to the conversations were very amusing. I hadn't expected all of the political or religious problems and found that intriguing. My only complaint is that the ending seemed WAY too neat and tidy and CONVENIENT. Things were wrapped up beautifully and all obstacles eliminated in the last 10 pages, which sort of cheapened all the struggles in the previous 420 pages, ya know?<br /><br />Still, I really enjoyed this book.	2005-09-21

Seemed similar to \\"My Friend Flicka\\" and several of the other older young adult novels. Young boy (12) grows into manhood by learning tough life lessons, stern father and kind mother, no fully-developed or interesting female characters. I'm glad that Y.A. novels have improved since then.<br /><br />Still, an interesting and quick read. The authors did a LOT of research into the revolutionary war, and most of the characters (other than the Meeker family) were real, so that was interesting.	2005-09-21

It ended up being WAY BETTER than I expected when i began reading. The beginning was sort of bland and formulaic but about a third of the way in, things began to get interesting, and the last third was brilliant. Very fully-fleshed, interesting, unique characters. Extremely complex political intrigues and wars and treaties and strategy. My only real complaint was that this book did not contain a map. I found myself often flipping to the beginning in search of the non-existent map. Normally I could care less about such things, but the political and geographical realms were so intricate, I'd have appreciated a visual aid. Still, a very interesting and enjoyable (and fast) read.	2005-09-21

Neil Gaiman's use of language was a true delight. Each page (if not each paragraph) featured some wonderful treasure of a phrase. In addition to that, the story was very engaging. I could see the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" allusions, but this was less of a scary acid trip, and more just a wonderful spooky story. Gaiman's descriptions and wordplay were genius.  Often very succint, he could use just a small, simple phrase to make all the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.  (black button eyes?!?  Eek!!) Coraline was a very brave and resourceful young lady. Great stuff.	2005-09-21

Firstly, I'm personally really not into the \\"Fabio\\" type...so having that image on the cover, as well as in the hero, was kind of a bummer. But that's a small thing and wouldn't really have mattered, except for this fact: Nearly every single sexual encounter featured Deana saying \\"No!\\" \\"Stop\\" \\"Don't\\" but Lorgin never once listened and continued with what he was doing...and Deana ends up liking it, so therefore everything is okay?!? At least this was a little bit better than the RAPE scenes found in some of the more traditional \\"boddice-rippers\\" because the reader was able to see into Deana's mind. And her thoughts were always \\"Mmmm...I maybe want to have sex with Lorgin but I shouldn't or don't want to deal with the consequences\\" so it was a case of \\"Your mouth says No, but your eyes say Yes.\\" This is still creepy and WRONG, but a little bit better...but only a little bit.<br /><br />Here's an example: \\"Please, Lorgin, don't.\\" Lorgin says \\"Give me your mouth.\\" His tone was implacable and raw, all earlier traces of humor gone. Deana gazed upon his beautiful countenance. She knew in that moment, no matter what she said or did, he would not stop. He meant to have her.<br /><br />And, for the record, he doesn't stop...even thought she says \\"No\\" SEVERAL more times. ARGH!! I can sort of understand and expect this sort of encounter in older (I mean MUCH older books) but it's always upsetting to find \\"romantic rape\\" in contemporary romances. Power play in the bedroom can be a great thing, but that's not what was depicted on these pages. Also, the fact that it continued to happen throughout the book is even more disgraceful. The first time or two were annoying and upsetting, but that almost EVERY SINGLE time Deana would say No and Lorgin would overpower her and have sex with her anyways. It's the old adage that if she ends up liking it, than it wasn't rape. For shame!!<br /><br />Okay, so my complaints about the consistent second and third degree rape (as well as an arguable case for first degree) in the book aside, the story was okay. I'd never read a \\"futuristic romance\\" before. Indeed, didn't really know of the sub-genre's existence. Was amused to see the quirks that having aliens in a romance novel can add. Still, a little worried that Deana has just disappeared from Earth, never to return. I think I remember a mention early on that Deana didn't have a family anymore, but she had many friends. Who have now gone to the police department reporting that she showed up at the convention with a weird, controlling guy...and then disappeared. So, they all get to spend the rest of their lives thinking she's been kidnapped and murdered?!? Charming, I'm sure.<br /><br />Okay, but I'll stop complaining now. The book obviously held my interest enough (despite the aforementioned problems) to have me finish reading it. Really enjoyed the character of Rejar, so I may read the second novel about him...although if it is full of pseudo-rape scenes as well, I think I'll be done with Dara Joy.he ends up liking it, than it wasn't rape.

And totally still applies today, sometimes shockingly so. A few times this felt dated, but mostly it was a very sharp, entertaining, poignant, and important essay. I enjoyed the format of both lectures quite a lot. The first was brilliant, following the day of one woman thinking about the issues of women and literature, and seeing that woman encounter all types of barriers in her everyday living. The second provided more of the \\"meat and potatoes\\" (the heart and facts) of the problems faced by women who wish to participate in literature.

Should be required reading for EVERYONE! I loved her chapter at the end about how, sadly, we are none too far away from this type of thinking, with several examples, such as \\"The Rules.\\" It just made me very sad and angry at times, while laughing out loud or cringing in horror at others.

After reading it, I can understand my mom's disappointment with this book, but I still found pieces to love. However, I know that my expectations had been much lower (after hearing her review) so I'm sure that helped too. The poems set to songs were DEFINITELY my favorite. (However, I didn't always know the tune, which sort of made those poems a bust, ya know?) A note: the Sea Shanties all work well to the opening theme from Gilligan's Island, and I knew most of the musical-related songs.<br /><br />Also, Trillin's prose introductions to each section were great...in many times better than the poems within. The section in which he takes the blame for John Ashcroft was particularly amusing.<br /><br />But, several of the poems left me feeling very \\"eh\\" about the whole thing.  Ah well.

As the book has a copyright of 1940 I didn't expect much at all, but her character had won a trophy for best all-around athlete at Bryn Mawr and she thinks of the difference of being a woman in the west on a ranch as opposed to in a big east coast city. So that was kind of a neat find. (I mean, she still cooks and cleans all day but we see her chafe a bit under these restraints, have fond memories of her active girlhood, and see her wonder at, and perhaps dislike, how she's required to be MORE feminine now that she represents the idea of WOMAN on the ranch).<br /><br />Dang. I forget, sometimes, that it was once the norm to not \\"sugar coat\\" childrens' books. Life is rough and sometimes horrible things happen. We see Ken struggle with this. However, life is also sweet and precious. The blend in this book is perfect. Very real and wonderfully written.	2005-05-16

I'd never read any of O'Neil's works before...and had only seen a production of \\"The Ice Man Cometh.\\" This is so heart-wrenching and so simple a story. That's not \\"simple\\" in a pejorative sense at all...just that its emotions and truths are not buried under mounds of plot devices and flowery language. This play is just tragic and true.

Books	3	12	13	N	N	A mixed collection (some good, some not so good)	I thought this looked like something I should have on my shelf. Only a few chapters into it, there is an abridged version of \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. I read this in 1999 in a Women Studies course and remembered being affected by it. However,this time it totally FREAKED me out...all the bits about creeping women and being trapped. Eek!! (Although I had just seen the horror movie \\"The Grudge\\" so that may have influenced my emotions, too).<br /><br />Despite my powerful response to that selection, this book is not as wonderful as I had hoped. Rather than a list of 33 top/most important things, or 33 rarely taught things, etc...it is just 33 pieces written by 33 different women. One is a poem inspired by a woman's immigrant mother, another a fictional tale of women on the frontier, etc. I mean, they are each sort of interesting, but there is little cohesion between the pieces. And, the order seems odd. Still, makes a quick \\"bathroom reader\\" or as something to read while uploading songs to one's computer.<br /><br />I felt that the last third of the book was remarkably better than the first two-thirds. The pieces were more powerful and interesting, and lots of facts were introduced as well. Overall, this was not the greatest book I've read on these subjects, but it was fine. Also, perhaps this format makes these topics more accessible to someone who is not as familiar with them.	2005-05-16

(I had not read his previous books, despite their \\"Oprah Book Club\\" status). In his intro he speaks of his inability to say no to things, especially good causes. So, he keeps a pre-scripted index card by the phone to help him decline requests/offers. But, when the prison called asking him to teach a writing workshop (to help counter the depression/suicides sweeping the maximum security facility)he couldn't find said index card, and was forced to go.<br /><br />The stories are all interesting...some are better at writing then others, all are important. All are also, unfortunately, but probably unevitably, DEPRESSING. This is a very powerful book. I think that a few of the stories in the beginning were a bit weaker (but maybe I was just having an \\"off\\" day) but then things got rolling. Wheh! It is so important to have people read things like this, and realize that incarcerated persons are still PEOPLE. Made me very aware of all my blessings. (ie.

Written by the Penn of Penn and Teller, it was about an Atheist sock monkey telling a murder mystery. Brilliant! The actual product is not what I'd expected. Penn's style is very chaotic...reminds me a LOT of Kotzwinkle's \\"The Fan Man\\" (which is a BRILLIANT piece of non-traditional narration). The title of Chapter Two made me laugh a LOT. There are several funny bits. Sometimes (and by that I mean OFTEN) it seems that the author is very smug and proud of himself, he obviously thinks that he is an amazingly clever writer. The book can be very arrogant. Also, I think much of the point of the book is to SHOCK people. Lots of name-calling and disdain for much of \\"normal American society\\"--the monkey attacks all sorts of groups, including Christians and those who are less sexually adventurous throughout the novel. Also, it is EXTREMELY graphic (again, for contrived shock value, it seems to me). That's not to say that I don't agree with the monkey's P.O.V.--often I think he is dead on (no pun intended) and the monkey/author are definitely not afraid to speak their mind. Sometimes, though, it seems the only point for including some \\"SHOCKING\\" pollitically incorrect statement is to create buzz. Maybe I'm just being cynical.<br /><br />At one point in the novel we (the audience) get to read some of the killer's writings. It's some pretty messed up stuff.<br /><br />There is one bit of the style that I really do like, though. Every paragraph ends with a song lyric. Most of them I can identify, but even those I can't, they fit thematically.<br /><br />Overall, I was just not impressed by this book. I was often put off by its arrogance and tone. The chapters written by the killer were very psychopathic (appropriately)...they totally creeped me out. The last few chapters (which were, luckily, NOT written by Dickie the sock monkey) did wrap things up nicely, but I'm just not sure that reading this was worth it. Some of the books assertions were so \\"shocking\\" that it was very bothersome to wade through. (The whole part about how women want to have sex with cops and that they all mostly have a secret wish to be \\"raped by a pig\\"...just, I have no words...I hardly think that a handcuff/power play fantasy is the same as a rape-wish.) Much of the book was full of these little asides from Dickie. Perhaps that was all supposed to be part of his character-that he was so course and harsh and bad, but I didn't enjoy it. Most of the reviews from Amazon.com have been very positive so, obviously, Penn's novel works for some people.<br /><br />Also, I thought the \\"clues\\" and foreshadowing was a bit heavy-handed. Some of the \\"trivial\\" details that would later lead to the discovery seemed so glaringly obvious as I read along...the author seemed to have trouble layering and hiding those facts in the fabric of the story. Oh well. I still love the fact that the back cover has a picture of a sock monkey mooning the reader.at reading this was worth it.

This had its amusing bits...the fact that many different artists contributed made it seem disjointed at times (the narrative being stories from elderly men in a nursing home didn't help with continuity, either *Smile* )<br /><br />Still, it helped me pass the time. Some were truly sweet, some interesting, others scary and some dull...and then there were those that left me scratching my head. Oh well.	2005-05-16

When not actively reading him, I am aware that I think he is a brilliant author, but it seems that I must be in the act of devouring his words in order to become fully aware of the depths of my feelings. This is an AMAZING collection of short stories. Vignettes are where I think Alexie shines brightest, so that is a good thing. (Both his poetry and fiction are great, don't get me wrong, and \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" was a great blend of inter-connected vignettes (much like Sandra Cisneros's \\"House on Mango Street\\")). The title story blew my mind.<br /><br />This was a stunningly beautiful collection of stories. In the beginning I was a bit thrown off by some of the frank and unexpected sexual goings-on, but not for too long. Starting halfway through the book, with \\"The Sin Eaters\\" I felt that the stories began to be better than in the beginning. They were always good, but with \\"The Sin Eaters\\" and especially by \\"Indian Country\\" they were AMAZING!! The last four stories in this collection are some of the best writing I've ever read. *contented sigh* Just gorgeous and so powerful. (some of the observations about anthropologists and Collegiate responses/teachings to/about Native Americans were spot on and very amusing/cutting).	2005-05-16

I really knew very little about this story before reading it, and I was continually amazed at how eerily prescient (sp?) the premise is. I kept having to tell all of my roommates about it...and they kept asking \\"When was this book written again?\\" We were all continually suprised to see the copyright date as 1986. (I admit that I went back to verify that a few times). I mean, the way in which this religious fundamentalist takeover of the USA went down has SO MANY parallels to what has been happening in the US these past 5 years. A terrorist attack on the government that is blamed on islamic fundamentalists (in the novel this turns out to be not the case), people willingly \\"suspending\\" many of their rights as well as the CONSTITUTION in order to be \\"safer,\\" the army takes over due to martial law, next thing you know, women can't own property or have jobs, and then we're merely chattle. Eek!<br /><br />This was an excellent and chilling read. It was fun getting to discuss it with my mom afterwards. She read it when it first came out, and had thought it was this really freaky, crazy, impossible story. Now, as I recounted the plot, she said it was much more frightening because you can see examples of this type of oppressive-theocracy in several countries around the world, and you can see the seeds of possibility here in the USA. So, again, Eek!! Wheh! What an exhausting experience.	2005-05-16

She has a distinctive \\"voice\\" that made me very aware that this book was set in the South. In spite of this, I thought the book was fairly mediocre.<br /><br />The whole \\"wings, flying\\" symbolism/theme, etc is pretty over the top. I like that the mother named both her daughters after birds so they could fly above it all, but mentions of wings, flying, angels, etc are laid out VERY heavily. It seemed very glaring...at least one a page or so. It was so frequent and jarring that it distracted me from the narration.<br /><br />This book features a terribly abusive, messed up situation. Made it sort of tough to read at times. That being said, I was glad for the happy ending, and the novel did have some beautiful descriptions.	2005-05-16

I found it in a used bookstore when I was thirteen (1993) and completely fell under its spell. It's an incredibly EPIC and rich tale, following Pedro de Vargas from the Spanish Inquisition at home to the New World, with lots of drama and swashbuckling in between. I must have read this yearly through early high school. However, it has probably sat on my shelf for the last 6 or 7 years, which is a tragedy. (Confession time: I am a NUT for historical epics, in both literature and film, I love the grandure, the sweeping scale, the broad vistas). Recently, I was gripped by a need to partake in something EPIC so I pulled this off the shelf and it's been such a delightful ride, again. I've been long enough removed from the story that, while it is familiar, I am still in suspense for all but the largest of plot twists. I'm so glad that this is being published again. This was written in the 40s and deserves a chance at a new audience.<br /><br />After re-reading this recently, I found that it is even BETTER than I remembered. The story is so rich and complex...warm fuzzies! I stayed up WAY TOO LATE last night trying to get past all the \\"tense\\" moments so I could get some sleep. UG! But then, there were only twenty pages left so I stopped because I didn't want it to be over just yet. It was very interesting seeing the 16th Century Spaniards' sentiments toward the Native Americans, and then Shellabarger (the author) as an \\"enlightened\\" 1930's male trying to justify/explain them. Yet, the author had NO ISSUE with his characters' treatment of women. While several of the female characters are much more than dish rags (yay!) the concept of beating a woman into obedience is treated as an acceptable solution. I had forgotten that part and how it had rankled me during my readings of this a dozen years ago. Still, it's a tiny 2 page blight on a 500 page great adventure.	2005-01-15

I first read it in 1994 as a Freshman in High School. It's how I fell in love with Sherman Alexie (he spoke at my graduation last year at the University of Washington and was FABULOUS!!). It's such a lyrical story, the vignettes are lovely, very poignant.<br /><br />I love Thomas Builds-The-Fire so MUCH!! It makes me so sad the way in which he is received by most people in this book. His stories are so precious and important, I want to blast them over loud speakers!!<br /><br />So glad I re-read this. Such a beautiful string of intertwined vignettes, even when discussing UN-beautiful things, Alexie's poetic words caress my tongue and brain. Ahhhhh....Good Stuff. Very Powerful. Everyone should read this, at least once.	2005-01-15

I feel that I learned A LOT, and that Krakauer's presentation was balanced, well-researched, and very interesting. Initially I'd been drawn to the book because of a sick fascination with this crime (and with all manner of modern-day \\"Christian Warriors\\") but ended up gaining a lot more insight than I'd bargained for. Also, it was an amazingly quick read. The interview with Dan Lafferty was particularly interesting, especially when Krakauer asked him to compare his actions to other religious fanatics.<br /><br />Plus, I was happy to find an Annie Dillard quote in the final author's remarks (I just think she's an amazing, thought-provoking writer). Definitely taught me about the official LDS church as well as many of the \\"fringe\\" groups.	2005-01-14

It is narrated by a person whom I love so much...she is such a wonderfully TRUE character and I so ABSOLUTELY identify with her. Plus, the narrative style is so personable and delightful...it's a gorgeous story. The images of maps (duh! It's called Kartography...which I'm guessing is a combination of cartography and the fact that it is set in Karachi) and the way that residents of Karachi relate to space and place names...it's just BRILLIANT. These were some of the most accurately depicted 13 year olds I'd ever read, and their early twentysomething selves are equally true and satisfying. It was a bit amazing to me how much I could relate to them when I was fortunate enough to never have lived through all the civil war, violence and uprisings of Pakistan in the seventies, eighties and nineties, but that's part of what I love so much about this book...everyone is still human and has everyday mundane human moments, even when one's city is at war. Just, wow. This was the PERFECT book that came into my life at the perfect time. I  read the entire thing in one day...almost. I read 10 pages the first night, half of it at work, and then I stayed up well past 1am finishing it (and weeping like a baby too. What an emotional ride, but I cherished it!!)<br /><br />This novel is beautiful and very honest. God, I really identified with the narrator. You see friendships blossom and die and drift apart and change...it totally made me want to call all of my friends (especially those to whom I was close but haven't seen in awhile) but seeing how late it was when i finished reading, I refrained. *smile*<br /><br />Normally, when I've read an AMAZING book I run around making everyone read it (Josephine Tey's \\"Daughter of Time\\" is a recent example) but while I needed to tell people about this one, I didn't want anyone else to read it just yet. Because if someone else were to read it and not love it, I thought it would break my heart.

Albert Einstein's brain is in a tupperware bowl and it is being driven across the country by a journalist. The man who performed Einstein's autopsy kept his brain, and Paterniti is helping Harvey to return the brain to Einstein's granddaughter, who is somewhat perplexed by the whole thing. It's a true story which makes it even better. Still, it was a decent summer read, and had many people commenting while I read it. I just was not so thrilled with the final product...I'm not sure if Paterniti wasn't able to tell the story so well because he was IN it, or if this is just his writing style...I wasn't in love with it. However, I do still treasure the premise, I managed to read the entire book, and I learned things, so it wasn't all bad.	2005-01-08

Rachel Simon, the author, spent a year with her mentally challenged sister, who spends her days riding the city buses. However, the actual book was REALLY preachy at times, I felt. The author spends much of the book being critical of herself and how she is living her own life, but I often felt that I was supposed to be bettering myself too. So, that got annoying. Still, there are moments that are very sweet, sometimes too much sugary-ness, but Simon does not shy away from the ugly bits of life--I respect her for that.	2005-01-08

My only complaint is a problem I commonly find in stories with delightful child narrators...once that child grows up, I am no longer as fond of them. Still, there are some crazy-good bits, and the fact that Ruby Lennox begins narrating from her conception is terribly amusing. A very interestingly told story, dark comedy and tragedy mix well.

It is a very harsh, ugly story...and I read it on an exceptionally GORGEOUS day so it was a definite downer. At times I could identify with the protagonist, but often she was feeling much more lost and disenfranchised, almost, with the world than I ever felt as a teenager. A very accurate, and less commonly told, side to the coming-of-age novel. This book did stay with me for several days afterwards, so that's a good sign. I do love several of the quotes on the back, especially \\"Impressive...Godfrey writes with cool clarity and control that belie the out-of-control nature of the story itself...Copies will be passed from hand to hand in hallways, underlined in ink, defaced with graffitti.\\" from the Vancouver Sun. I do think this book is very powerful, and were I to have encountered it 12 years ago (when I was 12 and obsessed with similar stories, such as \\"Go Ask Alice\\") I think it would have had a bigger impact on my life.	2005-01-08

Well, this book took almost 100 pages until I started being able to adjust to its groove. It's unlike ANYTHING I have ever read. Individually almost each of Tom Robbins sentences is a work of art, so fully wonderful and well crafted. I liked that part right off, but was REALLY having trouble with the almost surreal and convoluted story. However, once I meshed with the book's stride, i took off running. I am loving this. Also, the fact that it is set in Seattle is great fun, reading about my hometown.<br /><br />This was such a trip to read. I was left, at the end, satisfied, but it took a long time to get there. I've heard that this is more \\"out there\\" than many of Robbins' books, so maybe not the best way to be introduced to him, but his style is wonderful. I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />While flipping through it once last time, I am compelled to copy out my favorite sentence, found on page 121. \\"The expectant pause is so large that were it a house, Christ and all twelve disciples could live there, although Judas Iscariot would probably have to sleep on the sun porch.\\" *smile*	2005-01-08

Historical fiction about the 11th century Japanese woman who wrote the WORLD'S FIRST NOVEL!! I hadn't even heard of her before. Liza Dalby (author) is an anthropologist and the only westerner to have become a geisha. This book was a magical find. Whether due to the small print or lyrical, sometimes dreamy, prose I found myself reading much SLOWER than I normally do, but that's not a bad thing. Very lush, i really felt transported. The translations of the poetry were quite good. I now feel very well-schooled in 11th century Japan (an era I knew little about before reading this novel). Very nice.	2005-01-08

Angela Carter's descriptions, especially of people, are some of the best I've ever read. I just couldn't shake this sense of menace and impending doom while reading the book. It has very gothic overtones. I was very fearful for the characters. (It didn't help any that the cover is very creepy). I mean, it is rare that recently orphaned British children sent to live with their Uncle (whom they have never met) end up in happy circumstances (at least in Literature and Film *smile*). Still, very different and interesting, and I LOVED her descriptions. The plot was very weird and different. The ending left me with a \\"hmmm...\\" feeling. Oh well. I'm still glad I read it, but what a strange coming-of-age story.	2005-01-07

I totally adored his \\"The Parrot's Lament\\" and was really excited to learn he had a new book. Eugene Linden presents some well studied proposals, with lots of information, in a clear format, and he is always careful to point out where the \\"scientific community\\" currently stands on each issue discussed. The dialogue surrounding animal intelligence is an intriguing one, and it's nice to see things from a non-scientist position...it is still well-informed, but he feels more free to use anecdotes. Still, each anecdote is presented on its own, not as supporting data, but as themselves...interesting moments that perhaps offer a glimpse not seen in many science journals. Plus, Orangutans are totally awesome.	2005-01-07

It's amazing...he speaks, thinks, and observes the world as I'm sure only a cat could. The rest of the book is fluff, but basically enjoyable...if you can overlook all the glaring historical inaccuracies. Also, the heroine often infuriated me with her helpless, clueless attitude (having just finished \\"Ella Enchanted\\" which featured such an amazing heroine, I was highly disappointed in this one). Nevertheless, it provided entertainment for a few hours, and some of Vivian Velde's details were amazingly imaginative. I must end, once again, by proclaiming that the character of Oliver is superb!! Most cat owners are probably aware that their pets see the world differently and it's fun to see that difference voiced.	2005-01-07

The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a straight-ahead adventure tale in the vein of HUCKLEBERRY FINN\\" and they were so right. Trying to remember back to High School English and the terms for Mark Twain-style novels...pastoral, perhaps? Whatever it is, this book is a gem. I don't normally read novels about the Marine Corps, but this is SO much more than just the USMC in the 1st Gulf War (OOORAH!!). It's a lovely, slightly mythical narration of the adventures (or mis-adventures) of two unexpectedly AWOL marines. There's a Kuwaiti princess to rescue, a mythical pearl, camel racing, beduoins...it's a great travel yarn that has the war as an often distant backdrop. Made me think about patriotism, etc without ever really getting preachy. The narrative style is very innocent and genuine. Private Carmichael (formerly a stoner-surfer from CA) tells his story faithfully and openly. Very wonderful. I'm so glad I picked it up. I'd love to see this novel in an English class...lots of meaty things to sink ones teeth into. Also, I'm sure there's a lot of meanings behind the rock and roll lyrics that Carmichael thinks of throughout the story. Great fun!!	2005-01-07

As always, he is surprising and dark, bitter at times, cutting, funny...it's a novel that is difficult to pigeon-hole. I really enjoyed it, I think. It's one of those books that one keeps rolling over their tongue and around their brain for days afterwards. It definitely made an impact and had some very interesting insights into society. Perhaps I get upset too easily but I often wanted to shout some sense into the lead character (whose observations are teribbly funny, but often fatally short-sighted) but I believe that's the point. I have to let this one percolate in my brain for a bit. Parts were wonderful, but as a whole I wasn't crazy about this novel.	2005-01-07

The Foreword by Roger Zelazny really had me interested (in all honesty I have NO IDEA who he is, but he definitely seemed delighted with the book)...and I must say that having completed it, I'm delighted with it as well. It's listed as \\"Steven Brust's classic novel of the revolt in Heaven\\"...having never even heard of Steven Brust I wasn't too sure. However, it's great fun to read. Very interesting, engaging, a great sense of humor (often wry, dry or subtle, but always causing a chuckle). The reason my sister became frustrated with the book is because all of the fighting/animosity/etc is due to a misunderstanding, and the machinations of one conniving, cowardly angel. As Yaweh and Satan begin the novel as great friends, one has reason to assume that things are not going to end well when a misunderstanding is had between them. When everything begins to fall apart, it is a bit annoying, but I found that when I stuck with the book...allowing myself to be annoyed for 30 pages or so in the middle, it became very interesting again. I only wished that I knew more of the pre-creation stories...because I'm sure the author included some jokes regarding Lilith or Yeshuah that I missed. Still, it was a very engaging read and an interesting new spin on heaven's revolt.	2005-01-07

I wasn't emotionally invested enough to actually cry, I guess, but it was a lovely, bittersweet story.	2005-01-07

Kurt Vonnegut Jr wrote the introduction and raves throughout about Kotzwinkle (the author). I must say that, although it took me a few times to get started (be sure you're not preoccupied when reading it), I did end up enjoying myself. It's a wonderful meandering stream-of-consciousness journey. I really felt like I was inside the mind of this drugged out sixties New Yorker. I found myself often frustrated with Horse Badorities' choices (or lack thereof). That boy needed someone to slap him upside the head. But then again, maybe not. (Perhaps that's the whole point.) I also was terribly fond of him and his rich life of simple pleasures. Horse's narrative voice has stayed with me for months...very original. My stalls and starts in getting into the novel coupled with my frustrations with the lead throughout the story are responsible for its lower score, but there were definitely moments of pure joy and wonderful surprises inside too!!<br /><br />PS-you absolutely must read this book for the Dorky-day chapter. Trust me.	2005-01-07

Originally this novel was published under the title \\"Do Try to Speak as We Do\\" which is much more wonderful, but I have a hunch that the commercial success of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" inspired the publisher to make a few changes. Regardless, this a great book. The situations in which poor Melissa finds herself are quite wonderful. Recently fired and unsure about her fiance, Melissa takes a job as the au pair for the most horrendous woman ever (she truly is a deliciously evil boss). The inevitable culture clashes are but one small part of this complex story, told with a clever turn of phrase. This novel is more of a buildingsroman (sorry, a term left over from high school english classes...refers to a coming of age story-my apologies to all my excellent teachers if I've remembered that incorrectly, it's not their fault *smile*) than anecdotal cultural and child rearing story (although there's plenty of that, too). Melissa, because of or in spite of her often horrendous living conditions (the tortures of bath time alone have made me SO appreciative of my hot water heater), finds herself during her year abroad. Jolly good show!!	2005-01-07

He's a delightfully sarcastic demon and it makes for pretty entertaining reading. A few times some of the \\"humorous situations\\" seem a bit forced, but overall it's a very enjoyable read. I was wary because Boy Wizards in London are all the rage these days, but this story stands on its own, and bears almost no resemblance to Mr. Harry Potter's adventures. *smile* Set in a modern day London where wizards run the government it's an interesting premise.	2005-01-07
US	30760825	R1RK2NTIOY4LMR	0312983298	412907251	Full Speed (Full Series)	Books	2	3	3	N	N	NOT the Evanovich I know and love	*Sigh* I want to start off saying how much I adore Janet Evanovich' stephanie plum novels...they're witty, concise, fun, etc. This isn't. I think that this book is more her lending her name to a friend who can't really write. Not only is the plot TOTALLY ridiculous, it is written very poorly. Jamie is falling for Max, an uber-rich, genius, James Bond-esque character who has created Artificial Intelligence, so he has a talking car named Muffin, who happens to think she is in menopause. Sheesh! I could forgive the weak plot if it was written well and/or amusing, but it's not. There is ZERO character development, and you only ever know what a character is feeling because they tell you...there is no \\"showing.\\" Jamie will say things like \\"Oh dear, I'm falling in love with Max\\" and so that's how the reader knows...not because there's been any chemistry or interaction between them. There were a few times that I laughed during the story...but they were few and far between.	2005-01-07
