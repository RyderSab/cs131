It focuses on the United States' effort to put a man into space. The story of the first seven American astronauts is told, along with a description of test pilots, scientists, and others involved with spaceflight during this time.<br />It is an excellent read, with just the right amount of storytelling, personalization, and technical details. The people are exposed as real people, not put on a pedestal, the way many books tend to treat historic figures. The movie version is good, the book is even better. Read this book whether you're a techie or just interested in this stage of American history.	2003-05-29

Set on the high seas amid treasures and pirates, it is the story of a young boy's adventure. \\"Treasure Island\\" has been done by everyone from Disney to the Muppets. It's been imitated many times and influenced countless books and movies.<br />A mysterious pirate shows up at an inn owned by Jim Hawkin's mother. The pirate is killed by a gang of rogues, but Jim finds a treasure map belonging to the pirate. Jim then embarks on a journey to far away island to find the treasure. Of course, nobody can be trusted - especially the cook, Long John Silver. With his peg leg and parrot, Silver is the stereotypical pirate. Once the island is reached, sides are chosen - the mutinous pirates against the ship's crew. Jim goes on a journey within a journey on the island, going from one side to another, as the treasure is hunted for.<br />Everyone should read this book at some point. It's especially good for young boys, due to the fact that the main character (Jim) is a young boy. It's well crafted, and easy to read. And it's hard to put down once you get going. What else can you ask for?	2003-05-23

It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.<br />Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.<br />If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read. If you you're read it already, why not read it again?	2003-05-21

It's the story of his journey from a pathetic victim of the cult to a pathetic victim of the world (the world being represented by his agent). It hits all the major un-politically correct issues: religion, suicide, the media frenzy, have -vs- havenots, you name it.<br />Palahniuk has a brilliant writing style. It's as if the pace of the writing matches the pace of the story. It reeks of energy. It's chaotic at times, refined at others. But it always fits the story - perfectly. My only complaint, although minor, about \\"Survivor\\" would be the ending. Was it what I was expecting? No. Could it have been a little better? Maybe.<br />If you liked \\"Fight Club\\" by Palahniuk (or the movie), read this book. If you like authors that aren't scared into being ordinary, read this book.	2003-05-14

Maybe I'm of the wrong generation. &quot;On the Road&quot; is written in a very flowing style, almost becoming poetic at times with it's description of music. I would recommend this book to anyone, if for no other reason, than to judge for yourself whether Kerouac is your kind of author.	2003-04-17

I was hooked. Rowling's expert writing and vast imagination drew me in the world of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarths. This book, and the others in the series, are great works of literature that will be looked back upon as the 'must read' novels of this decade. They are humorous, intelligent, imaginative, and adventuresome.<br />The \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" picks up where \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" left off. Harry is in his second year at Hogwarths. His aunt, uncle, and cousin still mistreat him. He still gets in some sort of trouble at every turn. And there is still plenty of magic and other mishaps. Something or someone is secretly turning students to stone at school. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine try to get to the bottom of it.<br />As with the other books in the series, I recommend this book to both adults and children. It goes without saying that you should read \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" first though.	2003-03-28

It focuses on companies and names we've all heard of: Apple, Oracle, Netscape, Microsoft, Intel, and many more.

In fact, I thought it was even better than &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (also by Gibson). It is more concrete, and more easily understood, in it's concepts. Don't get me wrong, it's still got all the abstract ideas and goings ons that are in &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. It's got all the action, all the technology, and all the wonderful characters. It wouldn't be a Gibson novel without them. They are quirky and fascinating at the same time. I think the characters are humanized a little more too. For all these reasons, I really liked the novel.<br />Don't skip &quot;Neuromancer&quot; due to this though. You'll enjoy &quot;Count Zero&quot; even if you haven't read &quot;Neuromancer&quot; yet. They are both good novels and deserve to be read in order. Plus &quot;Count Zero&quot; brings in little snippets from &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. I can't wait to start on &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, the next in the series.	2003-01-23

I watched the movie and listened to my wife tell me how great the books were. Still I put off reading it. I finally got around to reading it, and for one of the few times i can remember, the book lived up to all my expectations.<br />For those living under a rock, or stone (pardon the pun), this book is about the story of a young wizard, Harry, who is destined for great things. After dealing with a miserable foster family his destiny catches up with him, and he goes off to wizard school. Then the adventures begin - just the way you'd imagine a year at a wizard school would be.<br />The book is written in a very easy-to-read fashion, as it's targeted at both children and adults. I feel the material is appropriate for either, as long as they have an open imagination. It is an excellently crafted story, from front to end. Once you've read this, you'll finally get why this book, and series, is so hyped. I can't wait to start the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\".	2003-01-21

I decided to read the book after having seen the movie. Where the movie is an action adventure, the book is drama to its core. As always, I regret having seen the movie first and having it's characterizations impressed on me. In this case, the movie and book are so different that it didn't matter too much.<br />The book is about a young man, Dantes, who is severely wronged. He is imprisoned and vows to get vengeance on those who caused him to suffer. He meets a mentor in prison, escapes, and then finds his mentor's treasure. With this treasure, as a older man, he is able to exact revenge on his enemies. His many twisted schemes form the bulk of the book (practically ignored in the movie). The way these plans weave in and out of each other is magnificent.<br />The Count of Monte Cristo should be on everyone's &quot;Must Read&quot; list. It is truly a masterpiece that should not be missed.	2003-01-06

Gibson succeeds on all levels here - I enjoyed the story, the characters, the settings, the technology, everything. Gibson writes about imperfection - he doesn't gloss anything over or try to make it too pretty. The characters are flawed, and have weaknesses - just like in real life. They live in a gritty world - just like in real life. And around them all, is technology - just like in real life.<br />'Neuromancer' is the story of Case: a hacker-type, cyberpunk, whatever you want to call him. He makes hackers of today look like amateurs - he totally immerses himself into the machine. Washed-up and raked over the coals, he gets a chance at a come back, even if it isn't on the most pleasant of terms.<br />Read this book if you are a science fiction fan - if for no other reason than to see what all the hype is about. I don't think you'll be disappointed.	2002-11-19

It is as close to perfect a book as you'll ever find. From the story itself to the characters to the locations, everything seems exactly the way it should be. Fitzgerald's words flow off the page seemingly effortlessly.<br />'Gatsby' is the story of a man, Gatsby, who never gives up his love for a woman, Daisy. It is narrated by Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's relative Nick. Other colorful characters weave their way in and out of the story. The tragic ending, present in all good dramas, is used to great effect here.<br />If you haven't read this book yet, you should be ashamed. Buy it now, and make it your next read.

'Gatsby' was his greatest work, no doubt. In 'Tender Is the Night', he expertly displays why he was such a good writer. He was a master. He is great at building up rich, beautiful worlds that are barely imaginable. He opens them up to us, and drops us right in the middle.<br />In 'Tender Is the Night', you get to follow the story of a man's less than ideal journey through life. It takes you trough different women, different locations, etc. You effortlessly get inside Dick's (the main character's) mind. If you've read 'Gatsby', make this book your next Fitzgerald read.	2002-11-14

About the only things I remembered from the movie was the worms, the blue eyes, and Sting. Being a science fiction fan and wanting to form my own opinion of Herbert's story, I decided to read the book not too long ago. 'Dune' is a story, set in the distant future, about the battle for a planet and it's precious spice. It is full of adventure and fantasy.<br />'Dune' holds your attention throughout, and leaves you wanting more at the end {Herbert satisfies this craving with more Dune books). My only criticism is a slight one - there seems to be too many characters, plotlines, etc. going on at once in a couple of places - hard to keep track of it all occasionally.<br />I would greatly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction novels.	2002-11-12

This book is as far from boring as you can possibly get. It jumps back and forth between the present and the past - dealing with World War II and codes such as the enigma code/machine, and with modern cryptography and data protection issues. It takes these technical aspects and throws in adventure taking place on pratically every continent, likeable and interesting characters, and an excellent ending.<br />These ingredients make this book hard to put down once you start reading it. Stephenson has perfected the technology-based adventure novel genre that Crichton started. If you like Crichton, and haven't read Stephenson yet, start reading this book today - you're missing out. Even though this book is a lot longer than your everyday novel, you still want more of it to read.	2002-11-11

I wanted to know more about the subject of cryptography, so I tried this book out. It a very good introduction to the subject. It simplied the concepts enough so that they were easy to understand. Another good feature of this book, is that it wasn't all technical - there are historical aspects of secret codes and how those codes were broken.<br />Simon Singh has done an excellent job of taking a complex subject, and making it an enjoyable read. If you're a curious mind who enjoys understanding how things work, read this book.	2002-11-11

Since my Mom is addicted to true-crime stories, she served as my source of true-crime books, like this one. I had to read this one myself to clarify what I'd heard about this story.<br />'Murder in Little Egypt' was an excellent read. It seems well-researched.

Like this show, 'Accidental Empires' deals with the computer industry - specifically the PC revolution centered on Microsoft, Apple, and Silcon Valley. Being a computer nerd myself, I found the book both educational and entertaining. Cringely comes across as very knowledgeable and humorous. He writes with a very easy to read style that makes the pages fly by.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that is curious about the history of software and computers, or is simply interested in the people drove the industry to where it is now.	2002-11-07

This time on an overlooked island related to the first story. The story is similar to the first novel, but it's still a good read. Crichton adds his usual mix of technology and adventure.<br />If you saw the movie, but hated Spielberg's Godzilla-like ending, read the book. It ends differently.

'Jurassic Park' is Michael Crichton's story about a rich entrepreneur that figures out how to genetically create dinosaurs from DNA recovered from insects trapped in fossilized sap. His plan is to exploit his dinosaur creations in a themepark/zoo creation. In his haste to start making money as soon as possible, important details are overlooked, and things quickly go haywire.<br />I enjoy the technical detail that Crichton puts in each of his books, especially this one. 'Jurassic Park' is filled with science, drama, and most of all adventure. The addition of child characters and their views of the dinosaurs is an excellent touch. The movie was a good adaptation of the book, but don't skip the book just because you've seen the movie.	2002-11-04

The characters are funny, as are the situations they get theirselves into. I read this after reading another Po Bronson book, 'The Nudist on the Late Shift', which is non-fiction. I think 'The First $20 Million' is a good fictional companion to 'The Nudist'. Anyone who considers themselves related to the computer culture will find this book interesting.

A group of historian/scientists are recruited to test time travel out. Sound familiar? Like 'Jurassic Park' possibly? Just like 'Jurassic Park', things don't go exactly as planned.<br />If you enjoy other Michael Crichton books, or other technology/science/adventure type novels, this is a great read. Crichton has a knack for intertwining technology, history, and interesting characters. The twist with 'Timeline' is that the technology isn't based on computers or genetics or anything modern. It's based on the technology of 700 years ago. 'Timeline' is a perfect example of his masterty of the genre.	2002-10-30

Then I read the description on the back and the premise jumped out at me as being very original. I picked this as my first Gregory Maguire book. The premise is this. The main character is supposedly a descendant of the man Dickens based Scrooge on. She returns to England to her great-great-grandfather's house to visit a cousin. Once she arrives, the house is haunted and the adventure begins.<br />I really like Maguire's style of weaving in various legends and fairy tales ranging from Dracula to Peter Pan to Jack the Ripper. I also like how multiple storylines criss-cross the chapters. I was disappointed in the second half of the book though. The merging of the storylines almost seemed like an afterthought, and the story ended with a &quot;pffft&quot; instead of with a &quot;bang&quot;. I would recommend this book to others.

Or maybe if you're not in the computer field, it will provide a slightly skewed glimpse into the industry.<br />Po's 'The First $20 Million is Always the Hardest', a novel, is a better example of his work, and Cringely's 'Accidental Empires' is a better read on Silicon Valley.	2002-10-28

As is usually the case, the book is even better than the movie though. I really like Chuck Palahniuk's style of writing a lot - it's to the point. No flowery prose here.<br />My only downside to reading this was that I saw the movie first, which prevented me from forming my own view of the characters - I kept picturing Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Meat Loaf. I guess I'll have to go read Chuck Palahniuk's other books before they make movies of them. So if you haven't seen the movie, read this first.	2002-10-24

How could I go wrong with this book?<br />I bought it, and started reading it. It was exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't as tedious and solely military oriented as some of the other Civil War books I had started in the past and never finished. Finishing the book a while later, after reading 2-4 chapters a night, I realized even more what a great read it was. This book covers economical, political, military, and social aspects of the war.<br />For anyone wanting to study the Civil War, read this book first. It is a well-researched, perfect introduction to the subject.
