We read and we felt the wind in our hair as we plugged that annoying muffler with the Chicken McNugget, ate Beef Jerky for Breakfast, got big hair, and dreamed about peeing by the road side, all from the safety of our chairs, just waiting for the day when we could make all our Inner Bad Girl dreams come true.<br /><br />Then we partied Bad Girl style and Got What We Wanted, like a true Baddy, all thanks to Cameron Tuttle, and the cute, sassy artwork of Susannah Bettag.<br /><br />Sadly, this book falls really short of what we Bad Girls were expecting.  It's got some good ideas, sure.  It's got the adorable artwork, it's got the lists of fun things to do with condoms and panytliners (Will She ever run out of ideas?), but it's just not as good as the three preceding titles.<br /><br />I'm not sure why exactly this book wasn't as good.  I really can't say, except it seemed to have been mostly thrown together, by someone who was going through a real sexual dry spell, and craving some girl on girl action.<br /><br />I loved the first three in the series, and I LIKED this one.  It is worth a look, but not full price.  It is worth three stars, but not five.<br /><br />I'm sorry to the Original Bad Girl.  Better Luck next time.  I'll look through it more carefully before buying.	2005-03-16

Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, outside the outer limits, somewhere in the twilight zone, there lived four girls, all with weird names.  Misty, Star, Jade and Cat, were all products of bad homes.  Bad homes with bad parents.  After therapy wraps up, they want to stay friends, and so when Cat's adoptive Mother/sister/not-real-sister, decides to die, the girls get together and bury her in Cat's back yard.  Anything to keep Cat out of a foster home and get a clubhouse for themselves.<br />No one knows the woman is dead until the girls confess it, to save Cat from danger.  And here's the funny part.  That backyard/graveyard was in Beverly Hills.  90210.<br />Now, here is why you should not read this book.  You should not read this book, because it is bad.  As in poorly written, unrealistic, and just foolish.  The charaters talk like professers from Harvard and act like the kids on Barney.  It's one long 300 page joke.	2004-01-05

She was molested by the father that adopted her and her whole twisted past begins to unravel like a cheap sweater from K-Mart.  Her mother is actually her sister, however, it's not because they are from Alabama.  It's because their mother became pregnant with Cat after having an affair.  The older sister adopted Cat to save the family from disgrace.  The book is sad in a way the others aren't, but it's poorly written and the characterization wasn't very good.	2003-12-24

She is adopted by a couple, Karl and Thelma Morris and quickly adapts to their lifestyle, even though her adoptive mother is living in a world of soap opera and romance novels.  Crystal even has a boyfriend.  But then, her chance for happiness is taken from her, and she is alone in the world again.<br />This is the second book in the orphans series, and it's not very good.  None of the books are, the writer uses poor metaphors, which try to be sophisticated, but fall flat.  However, like Butterfly, some good scenes and good characters make up for all the shortcomings, and believe me, there are a lot.  I read the Wildflowers series, also, but I didn't like those girls, the way I like the Orphans.  They aren't as human, somehow.  Try the series, at least once, and remember, VC Andrews is dead.  This is just a ghost writer, and if you don't believe me, look at the small print in the front cover.	2003-12-24

Pamela Thompson wants to live through Brooke, by making her into a beauty queen, just like she was.  Brooke, however, just wants to play softball for the private girl's school she attends.  Peter Thompson, Pamela's husband is proud of Brooke's accomplishments on the field, but he can't help her at home, Pamela definitely runs the house.  Eventually, Brooke, unlike Butterfly refuses to give in to Pamela's desire to take over her personality, has to leave the home after causing Pamela to age....or have a nervous breakdown.<br />Better than the first two, not as good as Raven, but definitely getting there.  Please editor, work harder...	2003-12-24

She runs away to the boy she met on the internet, who turns out to be a psychopath that keeps her locked in a bedroom, tied to a bed with computer cables.  She escapes and eventually tells her parents, who realize they are hurting her.  The warm family ending won't work out, but that's where her story stops.

So, why did I buy the book that contains all four of the Orphans' Stories?  Because even though they aren't very good, there are scenes that are decent enough to be read once in awhile.<br />Janet &quot;Butterfly&quot; Taylor, an orphan, is a adopted by Celine and Sanford Delorice.  Celine wants Butterfly to be a dancer, just like she was, before the car accident that crippled her.  However, Janet is not her, and the results of trying to force the eager to please girl into the Pointe shoes, are disastrous.	2003-12-24

She has some good ideas, but mostly depends on her pluck and determination to get her through her times of financial trouble.

It is narrated by Brooke.  The girls have become friends after arriving very close in time to each other at the once upon a time resort turned foster home run by Louis and Gordon Tooey.  Gordon, however, is a monster, sort of a Uncle Reubenesqe figure.  All of the girls live in fear of him.<br />So, they come up with a plan to escape, with involves stealing the station wagon owned by Gordon and Louise, which they later find cocaine beneath the seat of.  On the way to California to look for Brooke's absentee mother, they are robbed by a fellow runaway and Brooke and Raven fall in love, one with a decent guy.  There is a pregnancy scare and in the end, Gordon gets them.  They manage to run away again, and this time, they run out of  gas on an Indian reservation and finally get some help, and even a home for Butterfly.<br />This book was really good.  It really made me like the rest of the series, despite the metaphors and dialogue that didn't seem even close to realistic.  There is something about the four girls that makes them human and worth reading about, that the Wildflowers series didn't have.  Maybe they just needed a station wagon.  Anyway, give this a go.  And if you like it, try and read the four girls stories.	2003-12-24

Maybe it's because her romance with the abused boy is so clich&eacute;d, or maybe it's because the lavish houses of Beverly Hills are missing.  Whatever it is, something is lacking in this story.  Might it be a talented writer?	2003-12-24

As in, legal trouble, as in, she very well may go to jail.  Raven is sent to live with her Uncle Reuben, Aunt Clara, and her cousins Jennifer and William.  Reuben beats her, Clara won't stand up to him, Jennifer makes things unbearable for Raven in school.  Raven dreams about getting away from them, but nothing seems to go right for her.  Eventually, however, Reuben beats her badly enough for the school officials to find out, and Raven is taken from the home.<br />This is the best in the series, easily.  It's better written and Raven is a better character than Butterfly or Crystal, equal with Brooke.  The last two of the series, have characters that are more concrete, and that the reader will empathize with.  If you are going to read the series, at least try to get to Raven.	2003-12-24

Misty is the first in the Wildflowers series, and floral metaphors are scattered throughout the five part series of poor little rich girls.  In Dr. Marlowe's office the girls will explore the pain of their past.  And yada, yada, yada.  The book tags and summary are so melodramatic it's laughable, and sadly, the inside of the book isn't much better.  For 150 pages, Misty whines about her life, using endless description, and clich&eacute;d metaphors, that a real person who was narrating her tale never would have spoken.  At the end of the book, we know that there is still more torment, for Star will be speaking tomorrow.	2003-12-24

Brite.  I thought it would be silly, certainly of lesser merit than something Anne Rice could have edited.  Boy, was I wrong.  I loved it.  So, then I thought, if this is what the lady can EDIT, think of what she can WRITE.<br /><br />So, I came to Amazon.com and looked up her novels \\"Lost Souls,\\" and \\"Drawing Blood.\\"  I bought them both, and loved them.  After that I wondered what of her work I could read next.  \\"Exquiste Corpse\\" sounded kind of freaky, (sorry, Poppy.)  But \\"Wormwood\\", despite a strange and dare I say, gory-looking cover, sounded good.  Then I read that there were two stories in this collection featuring Steve and Ghost.  Of course I bought it.<br /><br />I wish there was another full novel about Steve and Ghost.  I mean I would read about them doing such boring things as TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE and SMOKING ANOTHER JOINT or STEVE GETS IN A CAR CRASH AND CRACKS UP THE T-BIRD.<br /><br />Luckily, Poppy didn't take advantge of that when she published this.  The stories are good.  There were other good ones that didn't feature Steve and Ghost. They are scarier than Stephan King and more erotic than Anne Rice.  With Poppy, what more could you ask for?  She's one of the best.  She would be the best if only she would write another novel about Steve and Ghost.  Or another story collection featuring only them.<br /><br />Plus, in New York, Steve has to fight hobos, and has a chance to buy severed human heads.<br /><br />Buy, this, you won't regret it.	2002-08-22

This is the collecter's edition of the triology The Forbidden Game, incorporating all three novels, The Hunter, The Chase and The Kill into one book.  The cover art isn't very pretty and doesn't do Julian justice, but I do like the way Jenny looks on it.  Anyway...<br />The plot has been written out several times and I'm pretty sure that no one wants to read about it again.  So I will just tell you what I thought of it.<br />I read this for the first time when i was probably ten and i have loved it evr since.  I was the only one who ever checked it out of the libray I think.  I was glad to come to Amzon and find that over people liked it too.<br />I just wish Julian and Jenny could have been together at the end. He did care about her more than Tom did.  Julian would never snap at her or be arrogant, like Tom.  I know it had to end the way it did, but why?  Why?  C'mon if you were in Jenny's shoes who would you pick?  Arrogant Tom or ... Julian.<br />BTW, whoever wrote that LJ Smith must have had a thing for the king of the Goblins in Labyrinth, right on!  Julian DOES sound a lot like him, now that it's been mentioned.	2002-08-14

In this one, someone has been murdering vampires in St. Louis, and Anita gets blackmailed into finding out who's doing it.  She's actually a necromancer, she raises the dead for a living, but that doesn't stop the local vampires from deciding that she's the detective for the job.<br /><br />She eventually solves the mystery, but she meets her match on Jean-Claude, the seductive owner of a vampire strip club.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she loses someone in this book who became close to her in a short time, and she blames herself for it.  This plays out later in the series, making Anita more cautious with herself and others.<br /><br />This is a very good series, and if you want to try it, you should definately start with this one, or Obsidian Butterfly, which although it falls later, doesn't deal with the regular characters and has Anita working out in New Mexico for a few weeks.  I really wish the latest books were as good as this one.	2002-08-08

Lost Souls, poppy Z Brite's first novel, is definitely one of those books.<br />We are given three sets of main characters.  The first is the trio of vampires, Molochai, Twig and Zillah.  The are dirty, redneck vampires, rough and rotten.  The second charter, who can't really be a set all on his own, is Nothing.  He is Zillah's baby, but they don't know that when they become lovers.  The third set of characters is the Missing Mile Crew, Steve, Ghost, and Ann.  Ghost has ESP in a very big way.  Unfortunately he finds that he can't help everyone.  Sometimes he can only feel their pain and turn from it before it swallows him too.<br />I don't care what anyone says about Steve.  he wasn't a bad guy.  he went too heavy on the drinking and that caused him some problems, but he wasn't a villain like some other reviewers *coughs* *one star hinted.  Sure, he raped Ann, but the sad part was that he still loved, he tried to make things better.<br />The story is fairly twisted and you have to be in a sort of dark mind set to read it, but you don't have to be a goth.  you also don't have to be a social outcast.  if you like a book with characters you can love and feel for, or if you liked something with twisted, dark romance, or just something different, I defiantly recommend this.	2002-08-08

I decided to just go through and summarize since nobody<br />else did.<br />1) Do Not Hasten To Bid Me Adieu, by Norman Partridge:<br />This story continues the love story between Quincey and Lucy from Dracula. Lucy is dead though, you say? Well, that's okay. She<br />lives on blood and Quincey is full of it...<br />2) Geraldine, by Ian McDowell:<br />This is a pretty good story about a lesbian vampire and the bi-sexual woman that falls in love with her, Chris. Chris was molested<br />by her father and still has issues about and because of it. Geraldine has the power to take all of those painful memories away.<br />3) In The Green House, by Kate Koja and Barry Malzberg:<br />Like I said, there are some bad stories in here too. This is one of them. I skimmed through it and couldn't make sense of it, so I<br />didn't try to read the entire thing.<br />4) Cafe Endless: Spring Rain, by Nancy Holder:<br />This story is pretty good. It's about a sado-masochistic Japanese vampire. Not the best story in here though.<br />5) Empty Vessels, by David Silva:<br />This one's about a vampire who feeds on human emotions. He attacks a prostitute and drains her. Years later her son tracks him<br />down.<br />6) The Final Fete Of Abba Adi, by Jessica Amanda Salmonson:<br />I never could get past the descriptions of the triplets, but I did read one of the pages in the middle and would like to say that I don't<br />see how a dismembered corpse relates to vampires.<br />7) Cherry, by Christa Faust:<br />This is my second favorite story in this collection. Alex is a bi-sexual teenager who ran away from home and dresses as a girl to<br />work as a prostitute. He dreams about a vampire falling in love with him. One night as he is turning tricks a Mercedes with a<br />\\"vampire\\" pulls up and tells him to get in. Alex learns a lot that night....<br />8) White Chapel, by Douglas Clegg:<br />This one is weird. Not badly written, but weird. It was like the author was trying to pack too many things into such a tiny space.<br />He should have stuck to novels.<br />9) Delicious Antique Whore, by William Pugmire:<br />This story is the shortest in the collection. It is only about a page and one quarter page long. However it is very good. Found the<br />perfect mixture of terror of erotica. If only some other authors would take notes....<br />10) Triptych Di Amore, by Thomas Monteleone:<br />This is another one that was so bad and boring and long that I couldn't read it.<br />11) Queen Of The Night, by Gene Wolfe<br />This one might appeal to some people. I personally thought it was stupid. Something about a little boy living with ghosts or vampires<br />in a cemetery.<br />12) The Marriage, by Steve and Melanie Tem:<br />A vampire feeds off of his mortal wife's emotions. Now he has to find a new source becasue she is dying. I really don't like this<br />one.<br />13) In This Soul Of A Woman, by Charles de Lint:<br />This story was very good. It's about and exotice dancer who has no money and is about to lose her daughter becasue her<br />ex-husband's father saw her in the strip club where she worked. One night on the street she meets a vampire who wants to die and<br />leave her with all of the wealth the vampire accumulated. So the woman goes home with her, and they wait for dawn together.<br />14) The Alchemy Of The Throat, by Brian Hodge:<br />This is a mediocre story about a homosexual castratti singer. Hodge should have left the castrattis to Anne Rice. She knows what<br />to do with them.<br />15) Love Me Forever, by Mike Baker:<br />This vampire feeds on love. She always has violet eyes, but other than that she is able to change her shape. She preys on a trio of<br />friends, Chet, Mark and Peter. One kills himself, one wastes away and the other kills her.<br />16) ---And The Horses Hiss At Midnight, by A.R. Morlan:<br />The narrator and the tattooed girl from a carnival decideto go off and have sex after the carnival winds down for the night. The<br />narrator got more than he bargained for on the ride.<br />17) Elixir, by Elizabeth Engstrom:<br />A prostitute with a third nipple holds the secret to curing a veterinarian's color blindness.<br />18) The Gift Of Neptune, by Danielle Willis<br />This a very short story about a freakshow that has a vampire and a mermaid in it. They are both abused by the freak show owner<br />and eventually escape.<br />19) From Hunger, by Wayne Allen Sallee:<br />This was my favorite story. It's about two vampires, \\"one who knew too much about the world, and one who knew too little.\\" The<br />one who knows too much is a sado-masochistic ex-cop and the one who knew too little is a \\"hatcheck girl who occasionally lets<br />men follow her home.\\" This story is sad at the end and I thought is was a little bit romantic too.<br />20) A Slow Red Whisper of Sand, by Robert Devereaux:<br />This is a terrible story. It had too many characters and the two story lines never fit together. Plus Esme, the only character I<br />came to feel for, was killed by a vampire who played sex games with women names after rabbits. The women were named<br />Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, by the way.<br />Over all it is worth the seven bucks if you can find it at your local bookstore.ght.

I was thinking 'date with satan hmmmm. ok, I'll give this a try, always wanted to know where the devil hangs out.' So I rented it. There wasn't much to it, I finished it in under an hour, (granted I skipped some stories). I liked some of the stories, the title one was my favorite, because I liked the man character. I didn't like the story about the island of boyfriends it seemed very unrealistic, and I hated the one about the aliens. The cat lady and the rat boy, (forget the title) was pretty good also. The collection of stories however, isn't very well written, but some of the ideas have promise. In the hands of a capable story teller this book may have reached the New York Times best seller list. Prehaps one of the things working against it was the fact that it is a collection of shorts, in place of a novel. I would recommend that you borrow this from the library or a friend before buying it. Prehaps it conforms to your taste, prehaps not, but at least give it a try. There will be at least one story you enjoy.	2001-08-24

Misery is a masterpiece.<br />In this novel, the main character is romance novelist, Paul Sheldon, who after a car accident finds himself in the home of his number one fan, Annie Wilkes. But Annie hasn't finished Paul's latest book, and when she does and finds that he has killed her favorite character, she decideds to hold him prisoner until he brings Misery back to life. As you can see the title is ambiguous. She has many ways to keep Paul writting, but I won't go into that now.<br />Anyone who says King isn't a good writer, just take a look at the metahor of the red bird.  C'mon, loosen up, that's pretty good right there.<br />Read this book as soon as you can, but if you have a weak stomach skip the axe part. You might make a cookadoodie mess trying not to vomit on the floor.	2001-05-23
US	44171833	R2Z2MZIWWLEKMJ	0553296981	636860937	Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl	Books	5	2	3	N	N	wonderful piece of litrature	One must remember that Anne went into hiding at the age of 13, and at the same was going through puberty and expierenceing these two things at the same time.  Aged by her circumstances, but treated as a child, Anne turns to the diary as a single confidante.  She wasn't a complainer, she was silent.  These things must be understood.  She wrote a book that gave a human voice to a faceless tragedy.  When one reads it, one will understand that the people who died during the Holocaust, the russians, the jews, the poles, and the soliders who fought Hitler's armies, were people, with lives and familys, and not just a face to be glimpsed for an instant.  BTW it hurts me every time I see/hear an adult say that this book is over romanticzed, and that Anne wasn't a good writer.  If this is so true, than why is this one of the worlds most well known books?	2001-05-22

The girl isn't very bright and she doesn't develope like a regular character of stephen king's.  The book was a great dissappointment.	2001-05-20
US	44171833	R16QGDJXUWBXL7	0451167538	734693861	Different Seasons (Signet)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The best novel King has ever written	Which is kinda funny considering that this isn't an actual novel, but a collection of short stories.<br />The first stroy, \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redempetion\\" is about an innocent man being sent to prison. It is told from another inmate's perspective and is quite good although not the best story in the collection.<br />Apt Pupil is the next story, about an all american boy and an ex-nazi, who start a sick parasitic realtionship. There is alot of meaning to the story about how one cannot look into the abyss without the abyss looking back. The story is kind of spooky, and truthfully I didn't like it, but I appreciate it's exisytence all the same.<br />The Body is the third story and it is about 4 boys who set of to find a dead body. It is a coming of age story. The character of Chris Chambers is totally unforgettable, and I could easily identify with Gordie. The story gives you a look into the lives of Chris and Gordie, that was very well written.  This one is my favorite.<br />The Breathing Method is the fourth and final story in the collection. It is about a woman who is pregnant and not married, in the first half of the century. She dies before giving birth, but I won't reveal anything more than that.<br />I go through \\"seasons\\" with this book when one story is my favorite, each has had a turn. King is the worlds best writer. Here you have been invited to slip into 4 different worlds. Don't miss your chance. Buy this book.	2001-05-20
US	44171833	RCW7MI89UR5WB	0285632809	311311132	Great Irish Tales of Horror	Books	3	9	13	N	N	Gothic Fiction	The stories in this collection are more like gothic horror, than contemporary horror.  There are no big flashy scares here, but some of the stories are bound to stay with you after you close the book.  My personal favorite story is the one about the woman who took her son to Ireland for a vaction, and ends up loosing her son, and gaining a changling.  There's a very cool story about a cemetary that moves across a river also, and one that sort of reminds me of Shakespeare's Othello.  If you like classic horror, you will love this collection, and even if you don't, but like anything to do with Ireland, you should still give this a try.	2001-05-19

I can't honestly recomend it.  Also it is hyped up as being very sexual and it isn't. Not really.	2001-05-19

I think you will like it if you like historical fiction, but that doesn't stick to facts to tightly. Mercy Lewis was/is my favorite  character.	2001-05-18

And I was disgusted.  If this was China the USA would do something, or at least complain, but because we need oil, we stay quiet.  I didn't like Sultana however.  Big Woo, she wrote a book, but she still stayed married to her sexist husband and allowed her society to perpetuate its' injustices upon her and her daughters.  She should have fled to France and never looked back.	2001-05-17
US	44171833	R2UVG5CCT1WRZB	038529929X	313045692	Hannibal: A Novel	Books	5	0	0	N	N	So twisted	I like twisted love stories. This book was that and much more. I loved the first movie and didn't like the book, so I was kind of wondering about reading Hannibal.<br />When I did I was glad. It took me about 3 hours to read it in. The ending was great....The movie, however, has a different ending.... The producers didn't buy the rights to the book, they just used the namses of the characters. I would say if you liked the book, don't go to the movie, but you will have to see it for yourself.	2001-05-12
