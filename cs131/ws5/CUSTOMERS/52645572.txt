The characters, brownies, dragons, dwarves, humans and fairies are all given a different and charming voice my Mr. Fraser.  He more than deserves to receive the AUDIE award for his performance. I highly recommend listening to this audio book just to revel in the talent of this man's rendition of Funke's work. Brendan Fraser rocks.  I hope to hear him reading more books on tape in the future.	2005-09-12

I have only read two of David Baldacci books, this one and Wish You Well.  I have thoroughly enjoyed both of them.  In my opinion Mr. Baldacci is a truly talented writer.  He can take an everyday subject and spin an engrossing tale from it.  He does not resort to foul lanquage or gratuitous sex to enliven his plots.  He simply writes about life.  <br /> <br />The information he includes about the history and inner workings of the passanger train is fascinating. In lieu of boring you with high praise of this book I will merely say ...this is a <br />good book, pick it up and read it especially during this holiday season.	2004-11-28

In this fictional biography of Sherlock Holmes, Baring-Gould makes his attempt at unraveling and chronicling Holmes' sometimes mysterious life. The book begins with a short history of Holmes' childhood and family, all of which comes from Baring-Gould's imagination and a few tantalising scraps of information from Canon. It matches nicely with what we already know of Holmes, fleshing out his character and adding motive for his eccentricities and habits as an adult. <br />Baring-Gould continues by covering Holmes and Watson's first meeting and Holmes' earliest cases, much of which is quoted directly from Canon. Baring-Gould also goes on to describe Holmes' brush with Jack the Ripper in 1888, an interesting but not wholly satisfying account. <br />The longest departure from Canon - and the silliest and most unlikely bits - come during Holmes' disappearance after his plunge over Reichenbach Falls with Moriarty. Baring-Gould tells of Holmes re-meeting Irene Adler, with whom he has a love affair and a son (who grows up to be the famous and corpulent American detective Nero Wolfe, no less!), travelling to Tibet, where he becomes a Buddhist under the discipleship of the Dali Lama, capturing the Abominable Snowman in Nepal, and nearly managing to scale Everest single-handedly, before finally returning to England to resume his detective practice. <br />The book concludes with an account of Holmes' final cases, before his retirement to the Sussex Downs to become a beekeeper, from whence he helps the British Government to win both World Wars and lives to the estimable age of 103 (thanks to his discovery of Royal Jelly!!). <br />Sarcasm aside, Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street is an interesting read for any Holmes aficionado, and if one can overlook Baring-Gould's attempts to sensationalise, he has done an excellent job of detailing Holmes' life and sorting out the often-confusing dates and time lines of the Holmesian Canon. <br />It's simply fan fiction in its highest form, and assuch I can't knock it.	2004-04-11
US	52645572	R212MVRKP5BS9B	0553579525	121142412	The Moor (Mary Russell Novels)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Well-crafted and entertaining	In The Moor, Laurie King presents a skillful and sympathetic portrayal of the bleakly beautiful world of Dartmoor. The Moor is not, as many have suggested, a true sequel to The Hound of the Baskervilles, but is instead a re-visiting of the same geographical area with an entirely different viewpoint. Leaving behind the breathless sensationalism of the orginal Conan Doyle tale, King creates a world centered on the moor itself.<br />To be certain, King's Holmes differs greatly from the man Doyle wrote about. The Holmes of The Moor is less supernaturally prescient and much more human, his formidable detecting skills almost overshadowed by his concerns for his ageing friend and mentor, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. King brings Holmes to life as Doyle never did, fleshing in the cold-blooded skeleton.<br />This book may not please those who are rabidly dedicated to the canon, but it is ideal for any Doyle reader who has wondered &quot;What was Holmes REALLY like?&quot;.	2002-07-25

But this time Bain escapes his former clich√©d character and emerges in a strong supporting role. <br />Set at a slower pace than previous books in the series, Driven With the Wind never the less holds the reader's attention while  carefully solidifying and fine tuning the characters of the cast. Driven With the Wind delivers a satisfying finale to the first part of the Cheney Duvall series and lays a promising groundwork for the many books that we all hope will come.	2000-11-17

After getting mixed up with the wrong client, she is kidnapped and finds herself trapped in a silo with twelve others - the victims of a meglomaniac. Gilbert Morris draws out the suspense cleverly in one of his best plotlines. <br />I have read all of the original Dani Ross books, and I am glad to see that they are being re-released by Crossway. The new editions have been skillfully updated to fit in with their new 2000 time setting instead of the 1980's period in which they were first written. My only complaint is that I wish Mr. Morris had rewritten the descriptions of Dani's clothing as well, as they are still glaringly eighties and add an incongrous note.	2000-11-04

Politics and power plays are interwoven with the narration of the Princes' fate. Weir does an excellent job of trying to solve the mystery of their disappearence using circumstancial evidence and historical accounts. <br />This is not an historical tome, but a painless and well-researched view of one of history's most famous murder mysteries.	2000-09-30

In spite of fascinating details such as descriptions of the French court where Anne  grew up and the accounts of the court procedures of Henry VIII's divorce  from Katharine of Aragon, one never really gets the feel of Anne as a real  person. The lack of information about Anne's day-to-day life is one reason  for this, but the fact remains that this is simply not one of Erickson's  best biographies. <br />Enjoy this book, but read Antonia Fraser's &quot;The  Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; for a truer portrait of Anne Boleyn.	2000-06-30

The characters are real and engaging - the sweetly stupid Bianca and her hoard of suitors, Baptista, who is more interested in selling his  daughters to rich husbands than making them happy, the sly and masterful  Petruchio, and most of all, Katherine, the Shrew. The play is full of  action, comedy, and enough mistaken and hidden identities to keep the  reader happily confused.<br />Katherine, who appears to be &quot;tamed&quot;  by Petruchio's cruelties, learns the art of subtlety and diplomacy that  will enable her to survive in a society ruled by men. Her speech in the  last scene is not a humbling affirmation of the superiority of men, but a  tounge-in-cheek ridicule of Petruchio, Lucentio, and Hortensio, who think  that a woman can be tamed like a wild animal by a few days of bumbling  controll.<br />The Folger Library of Shakespeare's plays are the most  readable editions that I have seen. There are detailed side notes and  definitions of unfamiliar words, which are perfect for the reader who is  not familiar with Shakespearean English.	2000-06-30

The abandoned child of a disgraced mother, Elizabeth survived her father and both her siblings to become the mistress of  England. Shrewd, willful,  charismatic, and completely in control, she  dominated and used those around her to fulfill her goals. Ruling alone, she  suceeded in unifying England under one church, defeating Spain, and making  Britain a driving force in Europe. <br />This is my favorite of all of Carolly  Erickson's books. Go ahead. Just read it!	2000-06-09

An in-depth view of the beliefs of Mary's educators gives the reader a fascinating glimpse of Mary's motives and the  ideas that shaped her life. Mary emerges as a strong woman, challanged by  society's strictures and the demands she placed upon herself. <br />Erickson  tends to gloss over Mary's role in the many executions that took place  during her reign, but this book is an excellent read for anyone interested  in Mary's life.	2000-06-09

Montgomery's best-known book, but it doesn't deserve to be. While Anne is somewhat superficial and Pollyanna-ish, Montgomery gave Emily all the light and darkness of a living being. Emily's character is developed through her own eyes as she writes in  her journal, but a hillarious, pathetic, wise, and unforgettable supporting  cast prevent the books from being to introspective.  <br />Montgomery does  occasionally fall into her besetting sin of over-flowery descriptions, but  they in no way detract from the haunting beauty of this series.	2000-04-19

Once more I was moved to laughter and tears as I followed the lives of the people of Ballyknockanor. Martin's character was fleshed out nicely, Corrie  and Ceili's story made a heart wringing sub-plot, and Mad Molly was as  wise, humorous, and prophetic as ever.    <br />Though it's nice to think of  Kate and Joseph living &quot;happily ever after,&quot; I would love it if  the authors would continue this story in a different series as they have  done with their Zion sagas.	2000-04-06

The characters in this book seem to be disconnected from the previous books in the series, and there were too many Morgans and not enough Wakefields.   I did like the part about Jenny's friendship with Nell, the famous mistress  of Charles II, and the side plot about John Bunyan was fascinating. If you  want to read all the Wakefield Dynasty books, by all means read this one.  As a stand-alone, however, this book should be skipped.	2000-03-25

Amos and Owen, the two oldest Stuarts, struggle with their own  problems - Amos as a foreign news correspondent, and Owen as a  prize-fighter turned evangelist turned soldier.<br />Too many stories told  simultaneously make this book rather confusing, and the small amount of  time spent on each character makes for sketchy character development.
