This book was interesting and very informative. I learned a lot. It got a bit long winded toward the end and I started skipping pages. I didn't read the epilogue or the last chapter because I was just sorority-out.<br />But, it was a good book that I recommend. However, be prepared to dedicate some time to it... it's a bit long.	2004-04-26

I read this book in one sitting and I found it to be fair, warm and filled with interesting details and an overpowering feel of love. The glimpse into their religious beliefs was interesting and I appreciated it.<br />I held my breath waiting for news of Elizabeth the entire time she was gone and this book made me feel like a part of her extended family -- as were more people during that time.<br />This book is honest and true. It is not a publicity ploy. It was interesting to read how Ed and Lois fought off the personal attacks that arose during this hard time. I often wondered about that.<br />Great book. Well written. Interesting. Heartfelt.	2003-11-03

But then, suddenly, about 1/2 way through, I realized that not only didn't I like the main character, I truly couldn't even sympathize with her. I didn't understand her relationship with Mr. moody NY and each time I read the name Kilroy I wanted to skip ahead and get on with it...<br />I had trouble finishing this book and skipped many, many pages for a payoff that didn't come...<br />There are better books out there.	2003-05-16

This is a fantastically written book - not an ounce of self pity! This book is about a strong woman reclaiming her life. I am inspired by her courage. The writing style is easy to read and not bogged down by too many details or medical lingo. I am riveted by her story (as I was when it happened in 1989 - I am from NYC!) and I am thankful that Trisha has lived to tell the tale!	2003-04-15

I enjoyed this book, although I found the character to be very cynical and therefore, sometimes hard to relate to. She was all over the place and someone who I'm very glad to be able to say I'm not. I laughed a lot throughout this book, but I felt sorry for her too.<br />But, at the end of it all, I enjoyed the book and found it a fun, light read. But, I won't recommend it. It is not as good as other books within this genre and I can't think of anyone I know who would enjoy it (except perhaps my best friend). So, with that in mind, I'd tell a potential reader to move on and find something else - unless of course you find it in your hands and you're sitting on the beach!	2003-03-09

But, I loved it. The book was sadly funny - depending on who you care about in the story. If you care about the X's then you'd probably think that this book was sad, as their marriage is failing, he's having an affair, and the poor kid is bound to be in therapy for life. But, if you're rooting for Nanny, then this book is humerous, and portrays a strong woman character who is very realistic and sassy!<br />I identified with Nanny in many ways, even though I have never been a nanny!<br />I highly recommend this book. Also, I think it's similar in style to Good in Bed by Jennifer Weiner - the character of Nanny has the same kind of energy, humor, and strength. So, if you liked Good in Bed, pick this up...	2002-12-15

The one thing that I really liked about this book was that you got a feel for Fran's relationship with Bobby without having to read about it in &quot;real time.&quot; Her memory reconstructing events was a great way to tell the story of her marriage without starting at the marriage and then taking you to &quot;now.&quot;<br />However, a real flaw in my opinion was that by the end of the book, the stories of her marriage all started to sound the same. I skipped about 30 pages toward the end, and got to the part when Bobby finds her - and honestly, I don't think that I missed anything important.<br />This book is good - it's not too sad, and not too complex. If the subject matter was a bit lighter, I'd say it's a beach read, but it's not quite that due to the content.	2002-11-27

The characters were completely unsympathetic, and I couldn't relate to any of them. The story didn't grab me, and I pushed myself to read through the half way point and then finally gave up.<br />This is not a book I'd recommend to anyone. Not because of poor writing, but because the story wasn't interesting, and the characters were two dimensional. I didn't believe for one minute that any of the events would have occured in real life, and that made it hard to read also.<br />Pass on this one, there are other great books out there to read!	2002-11-26

This book was just what the doctor ordered - a quick, engrossing read with a lot of action, suspense and thrills!<br />I was really happy with this volume of the Alex Cross series b/c so much of his family and friends were included in this one! Many, many chapters were about Nana Mama, and the kids! Also, Sampson was featured in this one, and he had as much to do with this story as Alex! It was a nice change. This book was more than an Alex Cross mystery - it was also about him as a person and the choices that he has to make about his life, his loves, and his friends.<br />If you're looking for Pulitzer Prize winning writing, this isn't the book for you - but if you want excellent characters, a fast thrill-a-minute ride, and a great story, Four Blind Mice won't disappoint you.<br />Also - start from the beginning of the Alex Cross series if you aren't caught up - it's worth it!	2002-11-21

And, while the action in the story revolved around the death of Emily, the story was really about the relationships between the characters!<br />All of the relationships - between family, friends, lovers, etc. were complicated, and very realistic.<br />This book was interesting because it was told in a very detailed way, without overdosing the reader with details. We got to know the characters, their strengths and weaknesses, and we got to see how they related to each other (and didn't relate).<br />It was sad to watch this \\"family\\" fall apart after the death of Emily, and it was even more tragic to read how terribly the families coped with it.<br />But, Picoult portrayed the relationships, and the emotions in a very realistic manner.<br />If you're picking this up to read a great mystery, don't bother - there isn't much suspense. But, this is a fantastic novel because it explores relationships, and families, and friendships, and how they change, survive and don't survive a real tragedy!	2002-11-09

What made this book so special is that the characters were all flawed and imperfect, which made them very realistic and endearing!

Also, in terms of authenticity, her portrayal of a young conservative Jewish woman is right on! The descriptions of events, holidays, and worldviews were excellent!	2002-10-28

And, I pushed it to the front of my &quot;to read&quot; list based on her recommendation. And, I have to admit, while I loved the first 3/4 of the book, the story lost me at the end.<br />(Don't read on if you didn't read the book yet... I'm going to give some of it away in this review!)<br />I felt to sorry for Astrid throughout the book, and I loved the way that Janet Fitch portrayed such a diverse group of characters - she made each one unique and interesting! However, once Clair died, the book lost its spark! First of all, I was hoping for a happy ending (sappy, I know!) but mostly, I was enjoying watching Astrid grow as a person. And, it pained me to read about her life after she had those few years of growth and love. Realistic as it probably was, I was disappointed.<br />I skimmed the last 50 or so pages, just to see Astrid's reaction when her mom got out of jail, and even that was slightly disappointing.<br />It's not a bad read at all, but the end (in my opinion) left something to be desired!	2002-10-21

The end surprised me, which does not happen often. While this was a sequel to an earlier James Grippando book, I barely remember the first one, which I'm sure put me at a slight disadvantage in terms of personality traits of the characters. I read the Pardon, and remember Theo and others, but that story was not fresh in my memory and therefore the details were not coming back to me as quickly as they should have when I read this one.<br />So, with that in mind, read the Pardon first, (or read it again) and then read this - I wish I had.	2002-09-03

I never realized that Judy Blume wrote adult fiction, but once I saw this book I had to pick it up - memories of Superfudge and her other children's book bring back great memories!<br />Summer Sisters is a great story of friendship, betrayal and love. It is about jealously between girl friends and how they chose to deal with it. I loved both Vix and Caitlin and although I identified with each at times, I really felt close to both of them.<br />I really enjoyed the small blurbs at the end of some of the chapters that were written from the points of view of some of the other characters in the book - Abby, Lamb, Bru, Von, etc. It was a neat little glimpse into their lives from their own point of view and that added tremendously to the book!!!<br />All and all, this was a great book about relationships and what shapes us as people, friends, lovers and even husbands/wives!

The reality of the relationship between mother and daughter in this book is staggering. I couldn't believe how accurately Russo was able to display such a dysfunctional family - completed with separate points of view, excellent dialog and heart-wrenching sadness.<br />The story lacked a punch that Russo's other books have - mostly Empire Falls, Nobody's Fool, and some others.<br />The end of the book was a bit slow and it could have ended about 25 pages sooner than it did, but it was nonetheless very good.<br />If you haven't read Russo before, don't start with this. But, if you're a fan, you'll enjoy it, if for no other reason, the characters and relationships between them are great.	2002-08-27

She is a good character, and I think that I'll enjoy reading as her character changes and grows in the rest of the novels.<br />The story was OK, although the characters other than Kinsey were kind of one-dimensional. Also, I expected her to have some kind of social circle with friends, etc. and other characters that would weave through the following novels - but as of yet, we haven't been introduced to anyone.<br />As a mystery novel goes, I give it a 3 - not the best, but far from the worst.

There were a bunch of mysteries in this one book - and by in large, it was a great mystery. There were a lot of characters, and things moved along quickly. I really enjoyed the interwovenness of the stories -<br />2. At some points, the characters seemed dumb to me, and that annoyed me because John, Daffy and Lou are not dumb at all. Here is what I mean: When they went to Neal's arraignment with the story that the clock was flashing 2:22 - come on now - any clock that is flashing is clearly not working. I saw that from the first time Neal said it, and I can't believe that 2 great detectives didn't. Then, when Mary-Ann's brother gets Daffy's cell phone number and she can't figure out how - I mean come on - the magic marker on Margaret's arm jumped right out at me - and the Daffy I know from previous books would have picked up on that quicker...<br />3. I really loved the way Ridley worked Daffy and John's relationship. I was glad to see that Ridley didn't just disregard Daffy's relationship with Lou as he slowly put her together with John. There are characters that we know well and I was glad to see Ridley take his time with the characters and not jump into anything.<br />All and all I loved this book. As I wrote, the mystery as a whole was fantastic, twisty, and very interesting. There were a lot of suspects and as another reviewer wrote, while you suspected the brother from the beginning, Ridley kept throwing curve balls and knocked the theory off balance. And, even though I had some minor problems with the detectives during the mystery, it didn't take much away from the book.<br />I give Ridley a thumbs up for his relationship building between Daffy and John, and it was nice to see Lou just a bit jealous - that was very realistic too.<br />Good job!	2002-08-19

I thought it would be cute and that I'd enjoy it and put it down and move on. But, I was totally engrossed in it. It is way more than a kid's story. It's a great book for a person of any age to read and enjoy. I can only equate it to Shrek. I have a 3 1/2 year old stepson and he loves Shrek, but he loves it as a child. I love that movie as an adult. It's the same thing with this book. I loved it from the eyes of a grown up. And, the story awoke many sleeping emotions in me. I forgot what it felt like to feel complete wonder and endless possibility. Harry is a role model for children - he is just, honest, and a good friend. But, he is also a good lesson for adults too - it's important for us to remember to let our hearts lead us and not get caught up in the JUNK that clutters our lives.<br />Harry Potter is a great character and the book was fantastic. Pick it up and be prepared to smile all the way until the last page.<br />I have already started the next book!	2002-07-24

Iles took his time with developing these characters and it was well worth it. Before I go deeper into my review, let me say that I was very excited about seeing Penn Cage again. I really liked him (and Caitlin) and I was happy to see them both!<br />Now, about this book - it was a nice mix of real life and true Stephen King-style fiction. I felt like the &quot;out there&quot; stuff was mixed in well with the &quot;reality&quot; based stuff and there were enough characters on either side of the fence to make the book readable and enjoyable whether you believe Mallory was in other people or not.<br />As for my personal opinion on that - I believe that Mallory was in Eve and practically everyone else by the end. And, while I'm not sure if I believe in that in real life - I bought it in the book - hook, line, and sinker!<br />And, by the way, I really loved the characters in the book - Waters was a great character - complex and interesting.<br />This is a great book. And, if you've never read Greg Iles before, this is an excellent place to start!	2002-07-12
US	51380370	R1CMIPGVVC1AJQ	0316969680	540414996	The Beach House	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Surprisingly good ending	Let me start by writing that James Patterson is my favorite author. His characters are memorable and I have fallen in love with each of them as I read the words of Patterson's books. With that written, I have to admit that sometimes I am disappointed by his endings. But, since the characters are so rich, I am not disappointed by the endings... I simply enjoy being taken for a ride.<br />This book was different. I was concerned about the ending because with conspiracies, especially high level ones, the endings are usually terrible (Brad Meltzer fell into that trap with one of his books - I reviewed it...) Anyway, I was not looking forward to this ending because I couldn't figure out how Patterson would work it. I mean, Jack was in a pretty deep mess and I couldn't find a way out for him.<br />But, as always, I fell in love with Jack and I fell head over heals for Macklin!!! So, I wasn't too concerned.... Who cares right? I found Mack...<br />But, boy was I wrong! The ending was the best part of the book! I am not versed in the legal goings-on in the real world. If I was, I'm sure I'd know that the ending was not at all realistic. But, since I'm not - I have to say that I loved the ending. And, now that I've put the book down (I read it all in one sitting!) I have to say that it is among Patterson's best, if not the best.<br />Read this. If you've never read him before, this is an excellent place to start. If you have, then get ready and hold on - this is better than Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider. (Except, of course, Kiss and Along included my beloved Alex)<br />Oh, and one more thing - If you're reading this Mr. Patterson, I bet that Nana Mama and Alex would just love Macklin. Perhaps there is a way to introduce them????	2002-06-14

I enjoyed it. However, usually the snap shot encompasses a climactic event, and in this case I didn't feel like that was the case.<br />While Hank was struggling with his school, friends, and children, I didn't feel like there was a real story underneath.<br />Hank was well developed (as a character), and as usual, Russo's writing is more than noteworthy, but the other characters were slightly underdeveloped and you never got a feel for his daughter, his wife, or even his colleagues.<br />I think that this time, Russo didn't do enough to develop the characters, and he spent a lot of time describing scenery and places ... I'd rather he had done more people, and fewer objects - in terms of description.<br />If you want to start reading Russo, read Nobody's Fool or Empire Falls - those are each a better indicator of what Russo is really capable of.	2002-06-04

That came through loud and clear in the book. She talks very frankly about her relationships, and herself. And, I commend the support of her family in this because she revealed a lot of personal information in this book - and I'm sure that it took great support from them to be able to do so.<br />This book is about empowering people, both woman and men. It's about taking charge of your life and your health care. It's a story of survival.

I felt almost like I lived in that sleepy Maine town, and I wasn't ready to leave.<br />Russo does a fantastic job creating characters that make you feel - anger, disgust, annoyance - whatever it is, but you felt something reading this book.<br />I really liked Miles, and I found him to be a very realistic, sympathetic main character. His relationships with his dead mother, his daughter, his ex-wife and his brother were complicated and realistic.<br />I fell in love with this book. Not only because it was well written, which it was, but because I felt like each time I put the book down, time stopped in Empire Falls and waited for me to return. It was like the characters froze and when I picked the book back up, they came back to life.<br />This book is about finding out about yourself and your history - and realizing how both shape you.<br />What a great effort by a great writer!!	2002-05-10

But, and I wondered this throughout the entire book, why did Rosie write it? Why did she share it?<br />It was nice to get a personal glimpse into Rosie's life, and it was nice to read, in her own words, about her. But, while the story she told was interesting and very special, I didn't quite get why I was reading it. I kind of feel like Rosie was thinking out loud about a bizarre situation that she encountered and that I was eavesdropping. I mean, I guess not everything I read is for a reason, but I was wondering why this was published - I don't think that reason became clear anywhere in the book.<br />Was she self-exploring in front of the public? Was she trying to raise awareness about multiples? Was she trying to figure the situation out herself and decided to write it down to help? I am just not sure.<br />So, while I loved the content, and the story, I just can't seem to figure out why this was something she published and then, to take it one step further, I'm not sure why I read it. I guess because it was a quick and interesting read by someone I admire....	2002-04-29

I didn't notice that at first - it was a weird thing - first my mind started wandering and then, finally, the last straw, I started not only skipping sentences, but that led to paragraphs and then finally, I was skipping pages. I put the book down after the end of the first section - after the fake suicide.<br />Here are my reasons:<br />1. Too much detail - way too much!<br />2. Too much needless information - things I didn't need to know were discussed in great detail<br />3. The book was physically hard to read - small type and too many words on the page - oh, and the chapters were very long too.<br />I just couldn't get into this story. While I was intrigued in the beginning, by the time I put the book down, I couldn't care less about who the Mr. R was - his reach seemed impossibly long, and there was not one ounce of reality in this book. The characters just didn't ring true at all...<br />Anyway, all in all, this book was a flop in my eyes.	2002-04-25
US	51380370	R14PDB2GCNXSG8	0316154059	817062475	City of Bones	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Good mystery, bad Harry Bosch	Here is my take - this was a good mystery - losts of twists and turns. Also, the pace of this book moved quickly and kept me guessing - a total success.<br />However, as a Harry Bosch novel, I think that book failed. While Bosch was himself, the characters that usually surround him were missing. As a stand alone novel, I would have loved it, but since it was a Bosch novel, I wanted more of the characters from the past six books.<br />Edger was there, and so was Kiz, but where were everyone else. I almost wonder if this was written as a stand alone book, but then became a Harry Bosch post production...<br />I know that in serial novels, some characters have to move on, but there was room for more of my old favorites from Connelly and I was disappointed that I didn't see any of them.<br />One quick side note - I think it was a nice touch to mention Sept. 11 - it brought the book some sense of reality and since 9/11 is still so much a part of my everyday life, I thought it was nice that Connelly referenced it.	2002-04-22

While I found the first hundred pages difficult to understand, I was enthralled with Linda and Thomas as the book took you back through their lives together. I fell in love with them both.<br />However, as I started nearing the end, and the pages were dwindling, I started to fear that there was no way the book could come to any kind of closure within the very few remaining pages - I was right - sadly!<br />I feel totally floored by the ending, and I am unbelievably disappointed. While I don't think the ending was a copout, I feel unfulfilled by a book that up until the end was very fulfilling!<br />Poor Thomas, living with demons. But, more so, poor reader who will be manipulated into loving these characters only to realize that they were lost before they began.<br />I saw the movie the Sixth Sense and I left there feeling satisfied - I have finished this book - and while the ending was essentially the same, I feel betrayed.<br />The characters are stolen from you - and they are endearing characters. I can only liken it to realizing, while reading Bridges of Madison Country, that the love affair was merely in Francesca's mind, and that Robert didn't really exist.<br />I can't recommend this book - at least not until I get over the great loss I feel at this forsaken ending.	2002-04-18

Fox's work, so naturally, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was surprised to read that he wasn't as innocent and straight-lined as he seemed on television. He has had his share of ups and downs (not related to his illness) and it was nice to read that he is human.<br />I enjoyed the latter half of the book because I \\"knew\\" him during that time in his life and it was interesting to read about his life from his point of view.<br />His marriage is especially wonderful to read about. They have a bond that is truly what marriage is supposed to be about.<br />I feel like I know Michael J. Fox a bit better now - not Alex P. Keaton, but Michael J. Fox - and I appreciated the opportunity to do so.	2002-04-08

You think that you understand what it was like to be a fire fighter that morning, but you don't. This book gives you a glimps, and it will take your breathe away.<br />The stories in this book are sad, and tragic. But, the brotherhood among these men is unbelievable.<br />Smith is an excellent writer, and what makes this book so inspiring is that he knew when to add his two cents and when not to. His thoughts during that day and the days following reflect the thoughts we all had, except he had a front row seat.<br />Read this. It's not a quick read, but it's well worth the time, effort, and tears!	2002-04-03

Reading about Lauren's determination, motivation, and sheer will to live via Greg's eloquent prose is touching and heartwarming! Greg's love for his wife is evident, as is her love for him, and their son!<br />Lauren's story is a true testament to the human spirit at its best. Her courage and strength of conviction make me want to be a better person. She inspired me!<br />This book is not a tearjerker - quite the opposite. It is a book about love, strength, and the power to put something senseless and evil behind you for the best reason in the world - your family, and even more importantly, for yourself!<br />As I've written, Lauren is an inspiration! Don't miss this book - it is more than worth the read - it is one giant step toward the courage that we need to fight back against terror!	2002-03-15

It's not your typical mystery, but it is still very suspenseful and well written. I had never ready anything by Russell Andrews before, and I was nicely surprised by his character creation, and his intricacies. I was a little disappointed in the ending - it didn't really fit, and it was kind of thrown together, but it didn't kill the book for me either. It was still worth the read!<br />So, don't expect fireworks at the end, but read it anyway - it's worth it - it's a great rollercoaster ride.	2002-03-11

The characters were developed further, and so were their relationships to each other. And, all that was in the background of a fantastic mystery with tons of twists and turns.<br />Patterson really leads the readers (and the characters) through mazes that seem to never end. And, when you finally do get to the end, you are led through one final twist that is sure to delight the reader. Great effort!<br />I read the book in one sitting, not able to put it down.<br />Read it - even if you missed the first in the series - it doesn't disappoint.	2002-03-04

He is a young, energetic guy with a fresh attitude toward driving and NASCAR in general. I enjoyed reading his perspective on the fans, the media, the sponsors, and especially on the other drivers. On TV, you only gets snippets of edited sound bites, but this book gives the fans a chance to spend &quot;a season in the life&quot; of a real guy living an unreal life. He doesn't hide the bad stuff for the sake book - he is honest and forthcoming - very refreshing.<br />Great effort by Earnhardt!	2002-03-01

The relationships between the characters were not believable, and characters that had no link to the story were introduced, for no good reason.<br />If I didn't know who the author was, I would bet that it was written by a newcomer who &quot;knew someone&quot; at a publishing house and therefore got the book off the ground, but alas it was Grisham. What a shame.	2002-02-23

A fantastic web weaver, Lescroart takes his characters on a trip into the dark world of HMO's, and hospital politics.<br />Everyone seems guilty at one time or another, and as a reader, you can't put your finger on the &quot;killer&quot; until the very end.<br />Diz, as usual, does a great job working his case, and his relationship with Glitsky is, as always, one of greatest parts of the book.<br />If you read the Dismas Hardy series, you'll love this next installment.

This one, however, did not disappoint.<br />But, more so than loving the story, I really loved the characters. If you have a sibling, which I do, this story will make you smile - simply because of the very realistic portrayal of a sibling relationship!<br />These brothers are great - their dialog is great - and, more to the point, their talking without dialog is great! It's worth the read...both for the story, and for the relationship between these two, very different brothers!<br />Great job Meltzer - you are getting better and better!	2002-01-21

From page one I was swept up in the characters and the story - but it's not to say that I liked what I was reading - I just couldn't put it down. The characters and the story were very complex - which kept me reading. The story is very sad, and at times hard to follow. The people in this book made me feel remarkably &quot;normal&quot; and very sheltered - I was shocked many times as I read along.<br />The story is disturbing, but if you can stomach it, it's worth the read. It takes you to a darker side of humanity - and the stuggles that go with that side.<br />Consuming, but heartbreaking. Read if you can handle 200 pages of pure sadness.	2002-01-02

I read it in just one sitting. However, it was VERY predictable.<br />Anita Shreve is an excellent writer, and I enjoyed her characters, but I knew the ending once I had read the first chapter.<br />And, not to be too picky, but I thought that the reason that Jack did what he did (don't want to give away the plot!) wasn't believable. I mean, I get that he lived 2 different lives, but the affiliation with the group (again, don't want to give it away to those who haven't read it yet) doesn't make much sense...and it wasn't explained because from the point of view of Kathryn, there was no known explaination after his death.<br />All in all, it was a good read...but not something that I would run to buy. Borrow it from a friend on a rainy Sunday afternoon...	2001-11-08

In general I find Stephen King hard to read because I trip over the details. I also have trouble with a reality based book becoming very mystical without warning. Insomnia, however, is my exception to the rule.<br />This is my all time favorite book - no doubt, hands down. I fell in love with Ralph from page one, and years and years later, I have not forgotten him.<br />This book is for anyone who has lost a loved one but knows that somehow they are out there. If you are open to it, this book will touch your spirit.	2001-10-19

My husband's father adopted him and therefore, I felt a deep connection to this story before I opened the book. I thought that the characters were realistically flawed, and that just enhanced my enjoyement of the book.<br />There were times that I felt a little overwhelmed by the details in the story, but I was happy to get to know the characters.<br />I especially enjoyed the ending of this book. I really loved the way the author gave us a chance to hear from Keefer, which was not the case (due to her age) throughout the novel.<br />Great book from a great author!	2001-10-17

I couldn't wait for the end to see how it all came together, and most especially, how he survived.  I was very, very disappointed.  The ending was a copout and lead me to believe that Brad Meltzer himself couldn't write his character out of this awful situation.  This was a real let down for me, as I was expecting to be breathless at the end.  But, I wasn't breathless at all, I was frustrated and disappointed. It's a good story with a bad ending...I can't, in good faith, tell anyone to read it because if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have.	2001-08-01

Great story, with many twists, and a touch of romance, which I thought rang very true.

I am a huge Ridley fan - especially the Lou Boldt series. I was excited to read this book, and it took me a long time to get into it. The first 100 pages didn't turn fast enough, and the only reason I kept going was because I am a fan of the author. But, the end of the book was fast paced, and the book got better the further toward the end I got. The story was interesting, with no clear cut villian. I liked the characters, although I think that both Peter Tyler and Nell Priest could have been better developed. I liked the idea of David vs. Golliath, but the story just didn't have the special spark that Ridley usually has. It's a good summer read for the beach, but it doesn't do the author any justice.  If this is your first time reading Ridley, don't start with this book - find his others first!	2001-07-09
