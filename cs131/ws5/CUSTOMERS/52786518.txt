The author seems to choose words for their shock effect and novelty rather than their accuracy and appropriateness, and inserts herself and her all-seeing, self-righteous judgments into a story where they don't belong.  The author seems like someone with a superior attitude toward others and like someone I wouldn't want to spend even five minutes with, much less a whole book.  I read about 500 books a year and this ranks as the worst one I've encountered in several years.	2004-05-15

It was as if the authors had completed the book and then an editor got worried about readers getting judgmental about people spending to achieve self-expression or better connection with their families.<br />Apart from that minor flaw, the book is a very useful discussion of ways companies can design, produce and sell high-priced (and highly profitable) products and services.<br />I especially appreciated their typology of today's emotional motivators:  Taking Care of Me;  Connecting with Friends, Mates and Family; Questing;  and Achieving Individual Style.  The examples are eye-opening and convincing.	2004-02-29

Soon I was groaning in incredulity that an American editor didn't catch his mistakes.  #1:  He presents Yale College as coed at a time when it was not.  #2:  He presents the governorship as a higher position than representing a state as senator, when it's actually the opposite.  #3:  He says a certain town in Connecticut was the last in the country to have paper ballots in a certain year, when I know for a fact that I voted on paper ballots several years later than that in Massachusetts.  His courtroom scenes are not very realistic, either.  Too bad as Archer can be a whopping good storyteller.	2004-01-14

(At least I didn't.)  However, if you don't know much about how the brain works and how people respond to different emotionally laden factors like color, stories, images, etc., then you'll find this a useful way to catch up on a lot of scientific findings that have implications for branding.	2003-12-12

If you have never been self-employed, had to rustle up clients and build a business, this can be rather frightening.  Let Tim Foster's book serve as your guide.

Originally I recommended Michael Larsen's book on how to write a book proposal, because it was the only such in-depth book available.  However, I did not like certain things in his sample proposal and did not agree with some of his advice.  When Elizabeth Lyon's book, Nonfiction Book Proposals Anyone Can Write, came out, I began recommending that enthusiastically because she takes the reader step by step through the process of writing the book proposal, and I thought her advice was better founded.  Having looked at Stephen Mettee's book, I will now recommend his book to prospective authors who don't need the depth and handholding that Lyon provides.  As you would want in any book on writing, it is highly readable, well-organized and to the point.	2003-10-17

Fern Reiss does this superbly in this book, taking the reader step by step through the task of figuring out how to present one's book to the literary world and successfully approach an agent.  Since 1988, I have taught 150+ seminars on getting a book published and have published 11 myself, so that I can authoritatively state that Fern Reiss answers the top questions people have about this process and does so realistically and helpfully.  Surprisingly (because of the 30-day format), the book is a good read, also.  Highly recommended!	2003-10-02

When you are out of balance, you can get needlessly fearful, anxious, tired, depressed or angry.  The numerous examples in the book are convincing case studies showing that remedies don't have to be expensive, exotic or difficult to get you back into balance.  It's well-written too.

However, the first chapter that would have been relevant to her needs deals with... how to keep your files straight!  My gosh, for someone who is in great need of organizing help, that is one of the last matters to address.  I found some of the examples in the book parochial and off-putting - who outside of LA and New York City spends $1,500 on a dinner party for six other couples?!  And who in the world told Ms. Leeds that the purpose of a mezuzah for Jews is to ward off evil?  That is absolutely ill-informed and incorrect.  She should have checked that information out before printing it.  In sum, you might find this book helpful if you are slightly to moderately disorganized.  If you are nearly hopeless at keeping your life in order, this book will not help a bit.	2003-09-11

I read this book while smarting from being treated as if having no water in our house for several days were not an emergency.  The well company came on a Friday, appeared to have fixed the well and left.  Twenty minutes later, the problem came back.  Had they subscribed to the Jack Mitchell philosophy, the service guys would have come back later that day, or on Saturday so that we wouldn't have been left without water for the weekend.  But nope, their weekends are more important than customers.  When he finally called me back, I even asked the owner if he could give me a beeper or cellphone number so that I could let him know if the next service call also didn't solve the problem.  He refused.  Now compare this with the Jack Mitchell philosophy, which is that an emergency is whatever the customer defines as an emergency, and that the customer counts.  And the customer counts not because this creates a fatter bottom line (which it does), but because people matter.  That's the part that put tears in my eyes.  His sincerity on this point came through loud and clear.  The book rates a &quot;5&quot; both on emotional and logical grounds.  I read tons of business books every year, and this one truly stands out.	2003-09-10

What got in the way of an otherwise fine book for me is that in quite a number of places, they rave about companies as only public relations or sales people normally do - telling you only one side of the story.  For example, on pages 31-33 they say that people who shop at this very online bookstore feel that their voice is heard, because of the computer programming that delivers a &quot;customized&quot; experience.  What they are overlooking is that if you truly have an individual problem, it's extremely difficult to get it taken care of here.  There are many other examples that have the idealized tone of PR rather than real-world observation.  If this doesn't bother you, you'll have a more positive reading experience than I did.	2003-08-25

It contains strong opinions and sassy writing from two freelance writers who have cracked major markets and figured out how to make a living as writers.  I don't recommend this book for beginners because it assumes that readers already know how freelancing works (or is supposed to work).  And if you do know a lot about freelancing, you have to read the book with a certain suspension of disbelief, since some of the &quot;rules&quot; it cites the authors obviously made up to keep their format consistent.  Still, the book is highly entertaining, and working freelance writers are sure to pick up some new ideas from it.	2003-07-26

I was so delighted to learn that this book is back in print.  It's a classic on the psychology and practicalities of motivating human beings to buy.  I refer to this again and again in my writing on marketing.  Run and buy it today!	2001-05-12

He understands the power of words like few other marketing experts I know. I highly recommend this and all of his other books on writing copy.	2001-04-28

But not until page 82 did I encounter a single fresh idea or interesting example.  This reads like the outline for a book that was slapped together.  It's not that the advice is wrong.  It's good advice, but there is no depth and no originality to it, and very little worthwhile content.	2001-03-06

A visual feast, the book also includes sound advice on preparing an online portfolio, constructing a site that puts a design firm in a positive light for potential clients and using e-mail as a marketing tool for keeping customers over time.	2001-02-27

This book DOES have something unique and very useful -- a built-in marketing calendar that you can use to pace yourself when getting ready to release a book and so that you do the right things at the right times.  I teach seminars on book publishing and promotion and always bring this along to hold up as a highly recommended book.	2001-02-18

Bush breaking out in a boil the day after Al Gore retracted his election concession (when Bush was probably &quot;boiling mad&quot;), you'll love this book.  It explains the psychological and physiological connections between the way we talk to ourselves and others and our health.  The book has many, many examples and exercises to show you how to make changes so that unacknowledged feelings don't ruin your health. It makes a great gift for someone suffering from a chronic or life-threatening illness.	2001-01-04

The information it contains is excellent and helpful for authors looking to promote a book, but at the bottom of the front cover it says:  &quot;A step-by-step guide to promoting anything from books to businesses.&quot;  Sorry, that's not accurate.  75% of the book has to do with book promotion only.  If you've got another kind of business, choose another book.	2000-11-07

Not willing to suffer forever in a relationship that lacked true intimacy, Rebecca was also not able to tear herself away easily from the commitment she had made to her husband.<br />This book will be helpful to someone trying to decide whether to stay or go, or trying to cope with the long recovery time of disentangling oneself from a formerly wholehearted relationship. And it will be of interest to anyone critical of the emotional damage inflicted by some fundamentalist religions.<br />Some will find it a profound mirror for their own doubts, fears and conflicted longings.	2000-10-11

In keeping with its theme, SELLING DREAMS looks at the role of luxury in our lives from the broadest possible perspective.  It offers fascinating anecdotes from craftspeople  who combine art and business in the realms of cars, movies, food and drink,  watches, hotels and more.  I was especially pleased to see the illuminating  perspectives from great philosophers alongside shrewd business analysis and  cultural insight.  A very unusual and worthwhile book that I already plan to reread.	2000-06-03

D'Vari demystifies the process of writing a Hollywood-worthy screenplay so that anyone can get started right away.   Bonuses:  Lots of creativity exercises and a nice overview of what  producers and screen stars are looking for.	2000-05-07

In fact, I listened to the interview twice, I was so enthralled with the human spirit and wisdom that came through over the airwaves.  Now that I'm reading the book, I'm even more taken with this man's journey.   The book does not portray Carter as some kind of idol but as a many-sided  human being who refused to be dominated and ultimately triumphed over his  circumstances.  Philosophically, the book gives me much to think about, and  it's a riveting read, one of the best books I've read in the last few years  (and I read about 400 books a year!).	2000-03-11

I have just read this book for the third time, and got even more out of it than the previous two.

I bought sixteen books on Internet Marketing and Web Design in the last four months, and this is the only one I couldn't finish.

As usual, Roger explained and illustrated some fundamental principles that make a Web site functional, effective and pleasing to look  at.  Lots and lots of useful examples.<br />However, the book needed  proofreading, as it contains dozens of mistakes, especially some captions  that don't match the illustrations.	1999-05-04

This is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book so much as a &quot;how-they-did-it&quot; book, and I found the level of detail and the range of businesses profiled extremely valuable and revealing.<br />You won't  read here about the same old Internet stars that aren't even turning a  profit, but about the kind of businesses that real people can start without  any venture capital.<br />Highly recommended.	1999-05-04
