The instructions for the facial exercises are clear and easy to follow, though, the line drawings may not be the best. But, this really works if you follow it to the letter and you are consistent (that is the key word - consistency). If you start early on, say in your 20s, you may never need a face lift. I bought the book when it first came out and had great success with the exercises. Unfortunately, I  lent it to a \\"friend\\" and I never saw it again. As it's been out of print for years I was so glad to find a used one on Amazon.	2005-10-05

She advocates a basic high protein, fat, and lots of green vegies diet, but with the twist of &quot;FOOD COMBINING&quot;! Her claim that you must not eat protein with carbs is totally unfounded and unproven.  This food combining is not new - every few years someone writes a diet book telling you not to mix certain foods in the same meal.  I can't imagine giving up meat &amp; cheese lasagna, meat and potaoes, shepard's pie, and many other dishes that call for carbs and protein.  I do believe in high protein low carb way of life and have had successs with it without having to combine my foods in any special way.

The orthopedic surgeon diagnosed severe sciatica. He put me on prescription pain meds, muscle relaxants and lots of bed rest.  Actually, bed rest was about all I could handle as all of the prescription meds kept me in a constant mental haze (but did little to relieve pain).  The doctor also referred me to a physical therapist 4 times a week (who has time for this - each session lasted hours).  After 4 months of this with not much improvement I'd had enough.  I stopped taking the prescription meds, switched to OTCs and began chiropractic treatments. A year and two chiropractors later the improvement was small but pain was manageable. Unfortunately the last session with the chiro left me feeling worse than when I began the treatments.  Then I found Robin McKenzie's book.  I could not believe the improvement I experienced after just two days of following his emergency exercises.  After several weeks I had complete recovery.  I have given this book to friends and relatives with back or neck problems and they have all found relief from pain and have gained full mobility.  The funny thing is that the positions and movements that Mr. McKenzie prescribes are exactly what the chiropractors and surgeon told me not to do!<BR>Go figure!	2003-05-15

Pilates was doing it much better and for decades before anyone ever heard of Lydia or Lotte. While Ms. Bach specifically states in her book that one must study the method with a personal instructor in order to achieve true and proper form and thus results - one would have to live in New York and have lots of $$$ as the Lotte Berk Studios are expensive, exclusive, and for the wealthy.

In one chapter she advises to eat rice, pasta, corn, potatoes (all foods very high in starch) but advises against eating bread!!!  I can only comment on the section dealing with my body type, perhaps the diet has worked for others.

Michael Rose must have been reading my mind when he wrote this  book.  Thank you Mr. Rose, for a book well written. There are countless people who share your opinion and hope that your book makes a difference.  I am appalled by the look of many new Catholic Churches. One has to really question what those in charge were thinking and how they can expect worshipers to feel the sacred in such places. A few years ago I moved to a new area and soon set out to find the nearest Catholic Church in my new neighborhood. As I walked up the street I had been told it was on, I saw a beautiful stone Church with gothic style stained glass windows and a tree laden courtyard. I was about to enter when I noticed the sign &quot;Episcopal&quot;.  Where was the Catholic church?  I turned and looked across the street. There it was - a super modern, super ugly, uninspired glass and stucco structure that looked more like a tourist information center (not a stained glass window in sight).  Inside it was spartan, like a town meeting hall.  To make matters worse there were &quot;electric candles&quot;!  I have no idea how many parishoners worship in that place, I never went back there.  In our current times we need places of worship that will give us a sense of tradition, holiness, sacredness, and permanence.	2002-01-12

I agree completely with the previous reviewer.  This book is especially good for the layperson who simply wants to change the atmosphere of their dwelling and will also be enjoyed by those experienced in this field. Ms. Linn provides us with info on all the tools necessary and also gives us alot of background info. If you're interested in this subject, please order this immediately.  What I like so much about Ms. Linn's books is that she recognizes and respects the rituals of many cultures, not just one in particular.  I read another book on space clearing (by a different author) and the instructions demanded that only a particular Balinese bell and tools were to be used - OR - the ritual would not work.  Needless to say all the tools in question were being sold by the author and were very expensive.  You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars, just follow Ms. Linn's instructions.	2002-01-11

I read this book because I saw the Masterpiece Theatre production on TV in the early nineties and fell in love with the characters and the story.  This is the type of detective mystery novel where one can truly relate to the detective as she is an average person with a highly developed sense of curiosity. While I shared Molly's intense curiosity about her absent landlord and her outrage at the so called &quot;water racket&quot;,  I would not have gone as far as she did to satisfy that curiosity.  Molly is rather reckless (if not stupid) towards the end and doesn't realize the consequences of her actions until too late - and even then chalks it up to coincidence.  All in all the book is a quick and delightful read that will have you longing to travel to those Tuscan hills.  I wish Masterpiece Theatre would rerun the film or make it available on video.  You've got to see the film. The cast was so well chosen and the locations are beautiful, especially the terrace on La Felicita.	2001-11-08

Well, after reading it carefully and preparing several recipes I feel let down. Not all the recipes are authentic Basque dishes - many are traditional Spanish dishes. Several recipes were quite bland and I can only imagine that you'd have to import the ingredients from the Basque country in order to get the results that Ms. Barrenechea describes.

This book makes you take a good hard look at your accumulating habits (not to mention all your JUNK) and really inspires you to get off the couch and start sorting and pitching stuff out (I have also donated much to local charities).  I had attempted this on many occasion but somehow never cleared out everything because I was so attached to certain things.  After reading this book I atlast have been able to get rid of things I thought I couldn't live without.  It is such a wonderful feeling of freedom when you get rid of the clutter. You're able to see new possibilities in your life.  I recommend this book to everyone.	2001-08-03

This book may be good for the woman who knows little about makeup and its application, but it is much too long winded.  Each product has about 3 to 4 pages of instructions (you don't need that much instruction on how to apply lipstick, not even the beginner).  Ms. Brown also covers too many subjects, and gets into fields she is not qualified to advise on, such as fitness and diet (she's a professional makeup artist not a dietician or physical instructor).  Also some of her makeup advise is odd and does not work (ie; line your lips AFTER you have applied your lipstick - Huh?).

This is just another vehicle for the author to showcase his magic on the human face (he is an extremely talented artist in his field) however, he is not giving us anything new since his last book and frankly, some of the contents of this book are rather bizaar.

However, I was soooooo wrong!  I bought her book last year and found it to be so informative and easy to follow.  I thought I knew everything about makeup application, but this book taught me a few things.  Morgen shows us how to look natural and glowing without looking madeup.  With this book you can look great for every occasion without people  noticing all your makeup.  I've also tried Morgen's makeup and skin care line that she sells on TV and the products are user friendly just like the book.  Buy this book, even if you've been applying your own makeup for decades.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at the simple advice that can make you look brand new. I'll be buying several more copies this year for gift giving.<br />PS:  The spiral design is great and convenient to use.	2001-07-15

For those interested in serious facial exercise I would recommend Carole Maggio's book and video \\"Facercise\\", and also a video called Flex-Effect by Deborah Crowley.

Though inexperienced as I was at the time,  I was still able to solve the simpler puzzles on my own.  THEN came the point where I reached the more difficult ones, and frustration and panic set in. Then I found the cure - this book! Some strategy guides out there simply give you the blow by blow instructions for solving a puzzle (and while this may end your frustration it also spoils that great feeling of accomplishment that comes from discovering  the solution with your own wits).  This strategy guide for Riven is different.  It is devided into several chapters which reveal solutions in incremental fashion.  The first chapter gives very gentle hints that stear you in the right direction without revealing any solutions. The subsequent chapters reveal more and more - until the last chapter which is an actual walkthrough giving you every step required to solve the puzzles.  If used properly this guide can be a great help.  Please fight the temptation to go to the walkthrough chapter - it will spoil your game.	2001-04-30

Sometime in the late 70s to early 80s an anti-fat movement began to gain momentum, to the complete detriment of American health. Mr. Bailey along with Nathan Pritikin, Jane Brody, Dean Ornish, and many others (including that hyperactive woman who kept screaming: &quot;Stop the insanity) became the gurus who have helped lead Americans into the state of health we are in today.  Ladies and gentlemen, please read the statistics - Americans have never been so obese, not to mention the fact that type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc. are increasing in this country.  The &quot;eat all you want&quot;, high carb/no fat/low fat solution may work (at best) if you workout maniacally, to the extreme on a daily basis (stop or reduce your daily workout and the weight comes back with a vengeance - EVEN IF - you are still following your no fat/high carb plan!  Since the mid 80s I had tried to lose weight and keep it off by following this philosophy and I experienced short periods of weight reduction at best (it was always an unrelenting struggle).  I would always gain the weight back faster than ever before - that is - until I got off the &quot;fat free/low carb merry-go-round&quot; and switched to the &quot;Protein Power Program&quot;. I've lost the weight painlessly, gained energy, and only have to workout 3 to 4 days a week to maintain (I include free weights, and Pilates). It's hard to believe that after all these years the philosophy behind books such as this one continues to prevail.  I only wish I could give this book 0 stars. Please check out the books by Drs.

It was quite dissapointing.  Her home now has light airy feel to it in general, however,  Ms. Ashwell advocates some rather weird ideas, such as choosing her make-up products for their packaging (so that they fit in with the decor!). What's up with that?  This is just one example of some of the impractical advise in this book.   I will keep the book because the photos are lovely and have provided me with inspiration for my own plans, however few.  Ms. Ashwell' home looks lovely but does not look like a place the average person would have as a primary home (the walls are wooden planks!).

Good luck.	2000-03-27

The only benefit this book has to offer is the breathing technique. It truly is very energizing - however I did not lose a single inch.  And, while Greer is super enthusiastic and rallies one to get up and do the work, I believe she owes her shape to much, much more than just this  program. The breathing technique could have been printed on 2 pages - no  need for a whole book! If you want truly remarkable and reasonably fast  results I recomend the video tape: &quot;Callanetics&quot;  by Callan  Pinckney (when done correctly these exercises can actually remodel your  body, even make you look taller).	2000-03-14

I purchased this book about two years ago thru a catalog. It took 3 months to receive it and was very dissapointed in its contents. The descriptions and instructions are barely there. All this information could have been put  in a leaflet. Though the photos are well done they are not enough, neither  is the text. Buy Carole Maggio's book and video &quot;Facercise&quot;. Book  is well written and the video is even better. The exercises truly work when  done correctly.	2000-03-08

I had the occasion to thumb through this book at a friend's house recently and was rather impressed with it (and with the results my friend has had). Yet, I still did not run out to buy it, however, after reading the previous  excellent reviews I'm ordering it asap. Hope I will have such marvelous  results to report in the near future. Thank you to all of you who wrote  such clear, comprehensive reviews.	2000-03-03
