I was less than five years old, and lying in my crib. As she turned each page, she leaned the book toward me and showed me the picture. I remembered those pictures, and that fragile world under sea level -- a world constantly under threat of annihilation by wicked black birds who attacked the trees on the levee which were protected only by cats.<br /><br />The place was Cleveland in the then Hungarian neighborhood around Buckeye Road. Because everyone around us was Magyar, my parents never taught me English until I got sent home from kindergarten with a note pinned to my shirt: \\"What language is this child speaking?\\" Needless to say, Mrs Idell was not one of my countrywomen.<br /><br />Throughout my life, I was always impressed with levees, as when I read William Faulkner's story \\"Old Man\\" and John McPhee's essay on keeping the banks of the Mississippi in place in THE CONTROL OF NATURE. One day, I had a madeleine-like damburst of memory: I saw the book almost entire in my mind's eye and used a search engine to reveal the title. Reader, I bought the book; and it was exactly as I remembered.<br /><br />I have read it several times since and love it for the reason that it stuck in my memory for more than 55 years. Of course, it's a rollicking good story, too, with an excellent moral: Never give up the things you love.	2005-08-01

Thousands of books are still published, but they are all engineering and scientific works with sesquipedalian titles. The real hero, however, is the city of Paris circa 1960: a city of engineering marvels with such devices as elevators, fax machines, underground trains, and gas-powered cabs. (Curiously, this future world also contains quill pens and giant accounting ledger books with scaffolding.)<br /><br />Verne's vision of the future is endlessly fascinating, especially as so many of his predictions have come true. Where the young Verne faltered, however, is his failure to display the rambunctious 19th century optimism of his later works. Instead of a triumphant tone, we have a world in which the individual who refuses to be a cog in the great works of society becomes marginalized and ultimately crushed. PARIS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY is a young writer's experiment that was rejected by publishers of the day, ostensibly because its vision was too far-fetched (it isn't), but oddly not because it was pervaded with a feeling of doom (which it certainly is).<br /><br />The book makes interesting reading for its insights, but fails as a story. The hero and his struggling friends are sadly short-changed.	2004-12-31

No, there are no fish-eating avians at Lord Emsworth's crenellated castle. There are, however, a plethora of plots involving two lovesick damsels and their beaux, a porcine pig-fancier, a walrus-mastachioed duke, the usual crocodilian sister, and, of course, the very obliging Galahad Treepwood. Oh, and there are numerous impostors, including a fake painting.<br /><br />There are, in fact, so many subplots that the aging Wodehouse left a couple of them hanging. One character (the ferret-like Chesney) seemingly exists only to push the Duke of Dunstable and Johnny Halliday down the Earl's grand staircase. And there is the obligatory theft (actually two: one successful and one not). There's a chauffeur named Voules who tootles a harmonica -- but of all there is the Empress of Blandings, multiyear winner in the fat pig division of the Shropshire County Fair.<br /><br />The story begins when the Empress, for the first time in recorded memory, refuses a potato proffered by the doting Earl. Before one knows it, Blandings Castle fills up with invited and quasi-invited guests and begins that delightfully Wodehousing grinding of the mill of the gods that leaves us all laughing, the crocodiles unsatisfied, and good to triumph over all.<br /><br />There may be better Wodehouses, and there are probably worse, but even a middling Blandings story is far better, dash it all, than 99.9999% of the cripple-crapple to be found on bookshelves. And you will feel better reading it. Dead certain, in fact.	2004-12-28

These \\"tales of ratiocination,\\" with Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes being the apotheosis of the reasoning investigator, are still the norm today in the English-speaking world.<br /><br />Such is not the case in France, where Georges Simenon has created an entirely different kind of detective, Superintendent Jules Maigret. In MAIGRET AND THE YELLOW DOG aka THE PATIENCE OF MAIGRET (1936), a man named Mostaguen has been cut down by a bullet in the Breton seaside town of Concarneau. At the scene of the crime is found a strange ungainly yellow dog. The victim belonged to a informal (and somewhat unpopular) group of businessmen who got together for cards and drinks every night in the bar of the Admiral Hotel.<br /><br />Superintendent Maigret is called in to investigate, along with Inspector Leroy. No sooner do they arrive, than attacks on the little group begin to ramp up: an attempted poisoning with strychnine, a missing local newspaper writer taken from his car leaving bloodstains behind, and the murder of a notorious philanderer. All these occur more or less under Maigret's nose. As the mayor begins to lose his patience with the big city investigator, the Paris press moves in en masse and camps out in the bar of the Admiral Hotel, kibitzing his every move.<br /><br />From the start, Maigret and Leroy take divergent paths. While the latter attempts to apply close deductive reasoning, his boss hangs out in the bar and has his attention riveted to the barmaid, Emma, and the yellow dog, who is somehow drawn to her. He instinctively feels that these two are somehow at the heart of the investigation and slowly begins to add to his knowledge of these two until the fog lifts.<br /><br />For most of the novel, Concarneau is besieged by foul weather; and the town is full of confused, frightened people who inevitably jump to the wrong conclusions and put pressure on Maigret and Leroy to follow up on their suggestions. Maigret not only keeps accumulating evidence but rudely ignores the press, the mayor, and the residents while marching to his own drummer. In the end, Maigret's instinct trumps Leroy's patient data-gathering and the wild surmises of the others, and everything falls together as the bad weather finally breaks, leaving Concarneau and us readers bathed in sunlight.<br /><br />The brooding quality of the scene, the confusion of the other characters, and the mysterious, almost solipsistic concentration of Maigret are the ingredients that make this a most delectable detective novel. This is the tenth Maigret I've read, and he seems to get better with every book I read.Concarneau is besieged by foul weather; and the town is full of confused, frightened people who inevitably jump to the wrong conclusions and put pressure on Maigret and Leroy to follow up on their suggestions.

From 1137 through her death in 1204, Eleanor was a principal player on the stage of history. She was married to two kings -- the mediocre Louis VII and the hot-tempered Henry II -- and mother to two other kings -- Richard the Lion-Hearted and King John the chicken-hearted. She had travelled to Constantinople, Jerusalem, Germany, and all around England and France.<br /><br />Among the characters that pass through this history are St Bernard of Clairvaux, the Abbot Segur, the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, Saladin, King Philip Augustus of France, Thomas Becket, Popes Celestine III and Innocent III, and hundreds of nobles, knights, clerics, and others. This history is a pageant, but one played for keeps. Excommunications and interdicts were bandied about as frequently as harsh words; and every fight had an ecclesiastical dimension.<br /><br />Is your wife getting long in the tooth? Just get the clergy to declare that the marriage should be annulled because of consanguinity (which consanguinity was of course known by the kings who married their cousins). Just as he is about to wed Ingeborg of Denmark, Philip Augustus has second thoughts; and the outraged Dane betook herself to a nunnery and began a years-long letter-writing campaign that finally got the attention of Innocent III.<br /><br />After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the Normans held both England and a large part of France. The Capetian kings vainly tried to take pieces of France back from the Angevin kings Henry II and Richard, but only under John Lackland (appropriately named) did they begin to have any measure of success.<br /><br />Where was Eleanor in all this? To her 83rd year, she was a player. Although the chronicles tended to follow the kings, Eleanor was never far away. While Richard was being held for ransom in Germany, it was she who held the country together while John vainly attempted to forge an alliance with the enemy of his dynasty. Although Kelly's work is scholarly, she keeps her sources in unobtrusive endnotes that do not interrupt the flow of the text. If you want to read a history that is a real page-turner, I heartily recommend this book.<br /><br />One of the main things I learned from the book is that Richard the Lion-Hearted was not the great hero of the English as he has been portrayed. For one thing, he bankrupted the country twice, first with his crusade and then with his ransome, and he didn't even speak a word of English. And he preferred to spend his time in Normandy.le John vainly attempted to forge an alliance with the enemy of his dynasty.

(Penguin Classics)	Books	5	12	13	N	N	The Jagged Edge of Marriage	In an unusual turnabout for a Victorian novel, we have here three cases of women being very uncertain about their men -- to the point of, in one case, jilting a fiance and, in the other, with threatening to abandon a marriage by running off with an infamous ne'er-do-well. Also, we have Anthony Trollope's most dastardly villain, the ambitious and egoistic George Vavasor, with a visible fault line through his face for expressing rage.<br /><br />In a Trollope novel, everything is not as it seems. The institution of marriage, in particular, comes in for some hard knocks -- all from the point of view of the women involved. Alice Vavasor, Lady Glencora Palliser, and Arabella Greenow come from the aristocracy and the upper middle class. All three women in the course of the novel grow and change before our eyes.<br /><br />As the first novel in the six-book Palliser series, _Can You Forgive Her?_ also introduces us to the world of high politics. Sir Plantagenet Palliser is about to become Chancellor of the Exchequer; and George Vavasor dips into his fiancee's fortune to run twice as a Member of Parliament for Chelsea. Trollope had always wanted to become an MP himself, and ran once (and lost) for the borough of Beverley. His bad experiences were the stuff of some masterful election scenes in novels, notably the much underestimated _Ralph the Heir_.<br /><br />Other Trollope set pieces include a fabulous fox hunt in Book I, in which the author himself appears under another name. There is also a dispute over an inheritance; fascinating legal trickery in George Vavasor's borrowings from his fiancee; and the typical Trollope developing of his characters' weaknesses until they pop.<br /><br />While over 800 pages in length, I felt as if this was less than half that. Yes, reading Trollope requires a commitment; but his books are intriguing enough to reward it. This is one of my favorites.	2004-12-15

Anthony Trollope's 47 novels contain many surprises, one of which is this delightful novel, which bears one of the most unlikely titles in all of literature. There is no better way to leave the megrims by the wayside than to immerse yourself into another time and place. Trollope was the Victorian story-teller par excellence.  After having read a quarter of his vast output, I have yet to discover a clinker in the bunch.<br /><br />A notorious curmudgeon, the Marquess of Brotherton has quitted England for the sunny shores of Italy. News filters back to his relatives that he has married an Italian and fathered a male heir, given the courtesy title of Lord Popenjoy. His mother and siblings are in a tizzy, as they are asked to quit the premises of the ancestral home to make way for a return of the prodigal head of the family with wife and heir.<br /><br />It seems, however, that there is little news and much doubt about the legality of the Marquess's nuptuals; and therefore doubt as to whether his so-called son is actually the heir Popenjoy.<br /><br />There is a delightful fox hunt (common to many of Trollope's novels), and a stormy marriage between the Marquess's young brother and a clergyman's daughter. She dares to dance the forbidden Kappa Kappa (the Lambada of its day) with a young wastrel, and raises the protective ire of every duenna within a hundred mile radius.<br /><br />Look for some very amusing -- and controversial -- put-downs of the emerging feminist movement.<br /><br />This is a good book to start reading Trollope. His two long series -- the Barsetshire and Palliser novels -- require a long commitment. Popenjoy is just right!	2004-11-11

Fifteen years of intense searching yielded only one old English translation of _The Red Postcoach_, which I found at the UCLA library. Much to my delight, there are at this date two of Krudy's works available in English: _Chronicles_ (with an introduction by Lukacs) and _Adventures of Sindbad_ -- both published by the Central European University Press in Budapest.<br />Why read Krudy? If you are Hungarian, like me, the answer is simple: Gyula Krudy in his writings distilled the very essence of being Magyar, that slow dance at the edge of a cliff that, along with pork and paprika, is at the heart of the Hungarian Soul. If you are not a Hungarian, you may enjoy reading some of the best journalism ever written since Dickens did his _Sketches by Boz_; or Joseph Mitchell, _The Bottom of the Harbor_. He took a snapshot of that fin-de-siecle Hapsburg world that careened into the abyss with the First World War and awoke to find itself cold and hungry in its aftermath.<br />The best pieces in the book were written during the 1920s and 1930s and look back to the Dual Monarchy (of Austria and Hungary) days from 1890 to 1910. Most notable are such originals as Baron Frigyes Podmaniczky, the Haussmann of Budapest (there is an entire article about his beard!); Miklos Szemere, gambler, sportsman, and parliamentarian, who was banned by Emperor Franz Joseph from Austria for an impolitic win at cards; and Istvan Tisza, the gaunt &quot;sheriff&quot; who ran Hungary with an iron fist.<br />Krudy's articles about the war start on an upbeat note, but change as the news of horrific defeats sinks in. Other articles cover the Hapsburg family, including one on Ida Ferenczy, the Queen's favorite lady in waiting. The best of the lot is a foreboding story about the coronation of the short-lived Charles IV at St Matthias church in Budapest.<br />For whatever reason you choose to read this delightful collection of journalism, I predict that you, too, will fall under the sway of that Magyar charmer Gyula Krudy.udapest.<br />For whatever reason you choose to read this delightful collection of journalism, I predict that you, too, will fall under the sway of that Magyar charmer Gyula Krudy.	2004-01-31

On my previous visit to Paris (in 1999), I was startled to see tough paratroopers armed with automatic rifles at the Chatelet-Les Halles metro station patrolling the platforms and corridors. Paris is no longer the city of Maurice Chevalier, or even Georges Simenon: What we have here is a rougher and edgier city with a compact tourist core surrounded by miles of slumlike banlieus along the edges.<br />Cara Black's flics barely have the time to deal with murder, when other events like terror-driven explosions and a horrible TGV accident in the station. Rumanian thugs in cheap exercise suits abound, selling their muscle to developers and with an eye on the main chance, whatever it may be. The Bastille area, site of a notorious castle/prison torn down in 1789, is now dominated by the huge Opera Bastille. The local neighborhood, however, is being forcibly torn down and redeveloped.<br />In walks private investigator Aimee Leduc. In the first few pages of MURDER IN THE BASTILLE, she is brutally attacked in an alley and blinded as a result of a damaged artery. For most of the novel, she can see nothing around her. The onus for the investigation falls on her dwarfish partner Rene, with occasional help en passant from overburdened police officers who knew her father on the force.<br />I look forward to reading the other novels in the series.	2004-01-21

It becomes very apparent as the Father of Our Country crosses New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia on his way home that Americans were not all that sure what they had on their hands. The cobbled-together Articles of Confederation took the easy way out by giving all rights to the states and virtually none to a central government.<br />As Washington bid farewell to the officers who had served him so well, many times he had to reach into his own pocket to allow them the luxury of returning home safely to their loved ones. Who was there to ask for money? The states simply weaseled out of any fiscal responsibilities when they involved another state. Even in 1783, this structure was teetering on the edge of collapse; and it continued for several more years until the Constitution was adopted.<br />There is a sense of newness in Weintraub's America in the Winter of 1783. The only thing the people had in common was their love of and reverence toward George Washington. Wherever he stopped on his trek, people emerged from all sides to honor him with balls and ceremonial dinners. They came together to marvel in the strangeness of their freshly-won independence. It is like Cortez and his companions in Keats' &quot;On First Looking into Chapman's Homer&quot;: &quot;And all his men / Look'd at each other with a wild surmise...&quot;<br />I like this book most for giving me a feeling of what it was to be an American at a time that most historians have seen fit to ignore. Stanley Weintraub saw a psychological moment in the history of a people and shrewdly built his story around the character of the man who held the whole shooting match together: General George Washington.<br />Don't expect penetrating scholarship here.

If you read the papers, you will find virtually no good news from the Dark Continent. Instead, there are stories of genocidal massacres (Ruanda and Burundi), slavery (Sudan), tribal violence (most countries), rampant AIDS (everywhere), child prostitution (Djibouti and Mozambique), terrorism (Egypt and Sudan), civil unrest (Zimbabwe), rampant crime (South Africa), and so on ad infinitum. Fortunately, Theroux had spent some time in Africa in his youth and still possessed a smattering of the local languages. And he had an incredible amount of courage and fortitude.<br />(One of Theroux's forebears along much of the route was Michael Palin of Monty Python fame in his entertaining &quot;Pole to Pole&quot; series of documentaries. But then, he went along with a large film crew and could afford to pay the baksheesh required to satisfy the ravenous officialdom along the route.)<br />Theroux traveled by ferry boat, canoe, train, bus, taxi, truck, van, foot -- in fact everything but bicycle or airplane -- from Cairo through the Great Rift Valley to South Africa, with a few interesting detours. Except for a foiled hold-up attempt in Kenya, he managed to avoid most problems by asking the locals he met questions about the road ahead. Whenever his informants said &quot;there are bad people there,&quot; he made whatever adjustments he could; but most times he just relied on his considerable street smarts and managed to get by unscathed.<br />In addition to the &quot;bad people&quot; one expects, there were a surprisingly large number of good-hearted people who helped Theroux without any expectation of return. In fact, the only group of people he unilaterally slams are the international aid workers with their bright new Land Rovers -- refusing all eye contact and associating only with one another. Even the missionaries prove to be more helpful. His comments in this area were quite an eye-opener to me: I had not realized what a failure five decades of international aid had proven to be.<br />I devoured this book in three sittings and was greatly saddened when it came to end.

Chronologically, the first was Cabeza de Vaca's 1527-35 trek from Florida through the American Southwest and into Mexico. Then there was the journey of Lewis and Clark in 1803. Finally, there was that insane one-armed army major who with nine companions floated down the unmapped Green and Colorado rivers.<br />Having read and enjoyed John Wesley Powell's own book about his 1869 expedition, I was shocked to hear that is was written decades after the events had taken place. Time had added an optimistic, even roseate glow to what was actually one hundred days of hell on earth with a crew that was grumbling and even mutinous at times. Instead of basing his book exclusively on Powell's book, he used the actual diaries written by Powell, Bradley, and others at the time to round out his tale.<br />No doubt, you know that thousands of people of floated down the Colorado in recent years. But Powell and his men used keeled rowboats in which the men with their oars faced the rapids with their BACKS. In other words, they were facing the wrong direction most of the time. When they undertook the journey, they had no way of knowing whether there were waterfalls that would plunge them to their deaths. (There is one such waterfall on the Little Colorado, which feeds into the Colorado proper south of Lee's Ferry.) As it was, irrespective of how much they grumbled, Powell saw all his men landed safely, except for the three who abandoned the party at Sepration Canyon and were mysteriously murdered by Indians or (possibly) paranoid Mormons who disbelieved their story of running the Colorado.<br />Dolnick's descriptions of the perils of white-water running rival Krakauer's descriptions of climbing Everest in INTO THIN AIR or the tempest in Sebastian Junger's THE PERFECT STORM. The author's attention to detail and apparent knowledge of his subject made DOWN THE GREAT UNKNOWN a joy to read.<br />My only real complaint is that Dolnick interrupts the journey with a multi-chapter flashback of Powell's experiences at the battle of Shiloh, where he lost his arm. The matter, however interesting in itself, should have been introduced earlier, along with more background information about his crew, rather than interrupting the main narrative.

The bulk of THE GUERMANTES WAY's 819 pages is concerned with two parties involving the glitterati of fin-de-siecle Paris.<br />At the party of the literary Mme de Villeparisis, Marcel gains his first admittance to the world of the nobility and gets invited to an evening of his prized Dutchess, whom he had gazed on from afar when she attended church services in Combray, amid the tombs of her ancestors. Sometimes, however, when you get your heart's desire, there is that nagging question: &quot;Is this all there is?&quot;<br />At one point in the latter party, Swann says to Marcel that &quot;one can't have a thousand years of feudalism in one's blood with impunity.&quot; The novel ends with the Guermantes about to leave for yet a more empyrean social gathering, to which Marcel is not even sure he is invited. (As we see in the next volume, he is invited and does attend.) At the very end, the Duke puts off seeing a dying friend and begins carping about his wife's choice of shoes.<br />We see the beginnings of Marcel's disenchantment with the social scene. Since this volume covers such a short span of time, we do not yet see the effect of his grandmother's death on the young narrator. We leave him, stunned and confused, at the threshhold of a personal triumph that has already lost much of its luster for him.<br />As I re-read Proust's great series, I am struck by how much I missed the first time I read it years ago. Many reviewers are struck by the length of the scenes describing the parties, but now I find that there is so much going on, and so many undercurrents, that the interior action passes quickly. Most of the action takes place in Marcel's mind as he encounters these gods of society and their hangers-on as they duel for position in their circles.<br />&quot;Thus I beheld the pair of them,&quot; muses Marcel, &quot;divorced from that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other women....&quot;quot;Thus I beheld the pair of them,&quot; muses Marcel, &quot;divorced from that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other women....&quot;	2003-12-15

If you exclude his early screenwriting career and his self-imposed exile in Europe, he was active as a director for only 16 years, from I SHOT JESSE JAMES (1949) to THE NAKED KISS (1965). But what films those were! THE STEEL HELMET (1950) is probably one of the two or three best war films ever made; and PARK ROW (1952) is in a class by itself as a valentine to American journalism in its heyday.<br />Hollywood autobiographies are notorious for settling old scores, and Fuller certainly had a lot of scores to settle. Coming into the business by way of writing, Fuller fought hard to keep his ideas intact through the shredding machine that was the old studio system. Film is a communal art form, and only rarely has the finished product reflected the vision of a single creator, sometimes because the filmmaker was a powerful producer/director  such as Hitchcock or Ford, or sometimes, as in the case of Fuller's own SHOCK CORRIDOR (1963) or THE NAKED KISS, because no one was looking.<br />Around the middle of the 1960s, many of the independent directors such as Fuller, Orson Welles, and Fritz Lang found themselves drawn to Europe, where they managed to eke out a very few more films that were not up to their previous work. After THE NAKED KISS, it becomes painfully apparent in the autobiography that Fuller had little else to do but write, attempt to put together funding for (mostly) aborted projects, or receive the homages of critics and other filmmakers.<br />What makes A THIRD FACE such a good book is Fuller's passion as a journalist, soldier, and filmmaker. He never lost this passion, but to quote Gloria Swanson in SUNSET BOULEVARD, it was the movies that became small. By the mid 1960s, Hollywood was a spent force. The torch had passed to Japan (Kurosawa), France (the New Wave), Sweden (Bergman), Italy (Fellini, Visconti, and Rossellini), and points in between. There were still some great films to come, but the number of productions had decreased; television continued to grow; and Americans were torn between superspies, hippies, and blockbusters.between.

John Burdett's BANGKOK 8 bids fair, however, to take the grand prize. Not only is Bangkok as exotic a city as you'll find, but Detective Sonchai Jitleecheep is the only member of the Royal Thai police force who doesn't take bribes or visit prostitutes -- mostly because he is a devout Buddhist.<br />When an American NCO is attacked and killed by a crazed python and a dozen cobras in his air-conditioned Mercedes of all places, Sonchai and his partner are sent to investigate. Sonchai's partner and soul brother dies from snakebite while investigating, leaving Sonchai to weigh the un-Buddhist possibility of revenge.<br />Bangkok itself takes star billing in this intriguing novel. Traffic jams are so impossible that the only way to get around is either by helicopter or motorcycle taxis driven by meth-addicted drivers. Prostitution is an integral part of the landscape, and even Sonchai's own mother is an ex-whore who plans to become the mamasan of a brothel for older men.<br />I challenge anyone to solve the plot. Until the very end, it just seems to get more tangled, but Burdett neatly ties all the loose ends. The only weak point is Kimberley Jones, a young female FBI agent who falls for Sonchai, largely because her character is too static while everything around her seems to change at the speed of light.<br />By the end, it is Thailand that seems normal, and the U.S. that seems to be stuggling in a sea of apparent illogic:<br />\\"What we don't realize, we Thais, is just how simple life is in the West. Too simple. The most modest of contributions -- a forty-hour week at the least demanding of mechanized tasks -- one earns a car, an apartment, a bank account. Other gifts of the system -- a spouse, a child or two, a small collection of friends -- arrive automatically and gift-wrapped with support of every kind.

When Thomas Jefferson came to sum up his lifetime accomplishments, there was no mention of his two terms as President of the United States. Instead, he saw himself as &quot;Author of the Declaration of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom, &amp; Father of the University of Virginia.&quot;<br />E M Halliday pretty much avoids the great political moments of Jefferson's life and answers, instead, the question: What kind of man was this? Much of the book is involved with Jefferson's relations with his wife, daughters, and -- more speculatively -- with his maid Sally Hemings, who was not only a slave but his late wife's half sister. Ever since Fawn Brodie first broached the subject in her 1974 biography, the Sally Hemings question has intrigued many scholars, at least those who were not previously over-invested in the notion of an altogether more celibate founding father.<br />I do not take sides one way or the other, but I find the possibility intriguing. Considering that Jefferson had in fact a documented ability to dissemble and act contrary to his stated beliefs, I am willing to accept that he was a less than perfect man. Today, some Kenneth Starr type abetted by a swirling band of journalistic and political harpies would have wiped the act in his face with every emission across the full media spectrum. But the times were different then, and there was an inherent disconnect among Southern slave-owners between &quot;could&quot; and &quot;should.&quot;<br />I am fascinated by the fact that Jefferson did not regard his presidency as the pinnacle of his career. He always valued the domestic life; he loved being a planter, though he was a financial failure at it; and he loved dabbling in domestic architecture. I thank E M Halliday's book for introducing me to this Jefferson; and I think none the less of him for his putative peccadillos.	2003-08-12

In the process, she has introduced us to dozens of colorful characters and an obscure island off the northwest coast of Sicily.<br />Curiously, it is the Japanese -- not the Italians -- for whom most of the tuna is reserved. They have factory ships offshore for processing the tuna into sushi and packing it to fly back home under ice. These mattanzas are intensely covered by the Japanese news media, as Ms. Maggio shows, because bluefin sushi is highly desirable, rare, and goes for astronomical prices in Tokyo.<br />Over the last two or three decades, the number of tuna and their size has declined steadily. One reason is that, at the time the book was written, European fishermen had overfished the tuna using purse seines. Off the coast of North America, stricter controls are in effect to allow the species to recover.<br />The process of luring the tuna into the elaborate traps for the mattanza is complex and deeply embedded in Sicilian lore. It calls for patience, strength, courage, and wiliness -- qualities which are fast disappearing as the knowledge has not been passed on due to the decreasing number of old hands available to impart the knowledge.<br />The only failure of the book is not the author's, but the publisher's. Explanatory photos and more schematics than the single one (in Italian) appearing on the front and rear endpapers are essential to support the text. There are some small photos that are marginally discernible, but plates would have been better. The mattanza is a complicated event, and I feel this is a serious omission. In every other way, I wholeheartedly recommend Maggio's work.	2003-08-09

It is fragmentary, brutally honest, and as direct as an uppercut to the jaw.<br />Other works in the same genre include Montaigne's long essay \\"Of Experience\\" and Tolstoy's novelette THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYICH. Somehow we would all like to think that we will escape pain and die softly like a snowflake evaporating in pure air. If we were all Zen masters, we could die like the sages in Yoel Hoffmann's brilliant collection, JAPANESE DEATH POEMS:<br />Inhale, exhale<br />Forward, back<br />Living, dying:<br />Arrows, let flown each to each<br />Meet midway and slice<br />The void in aimless flight --<br />Thus I return to the source.<br />  -- Gesshu Soko (d. 1696)<br />Though not well known to English-speaking readers, Alphone Daudet was considered one of the greatest French novelists of the late 19th century. A full forty years before his death, he contracted syphilis around the age of 17. Around the age of 40, Daudet's illness reached the tertiary stage; and he was bedeviled by a symphony of pain that attacked his various organs, sometimes with brief remissions before new and more awful symptoms appeared.<br />It is ironical that, were he alive today, Daudet would be cured by antibiotics; and Montaigne's kidney stones, possibly by medications, possibly by a routine surgery.<br />British novelist Julian Barnes edited this collection of fragments. It takes only a couple of hours to read, but I guarantee that this book will leave echoes in your mind about the battles you yourself may face as you reach the endgame.	2003-08-08

It is the poet Fernando Pessoa speaking: \\"If they were to tell me that it is absurd to speak thus of someone who never existed, I should reply that I have no proof that Lisbon ever existed, or I who am writing, or any other thing whatever it might be.\\"<br />You might as well know this from the start, as Saramago doesn't reveal it in the book: Ricardo Reis is a fictional character invented by Pessoa before he died in 1935. Saramago picks up Pessoa's character, treats him as a real person, and has him return to Lisbon upon hearing of Pessoa's death after a sixteen years' absence in Rio de Janeiro. Who should show up but the ghost of Pessoa, who returns from time to time to have ironic (and deep) conversations with Reis until a point nine months after his death, after which he loses the ability? I will not reveal the surprise ending.<br />During his last year in Lisbon, Reis keeps picking up a mystery novel he had purloined from the library of the ship that had brought him over: Herbert Quain's THE GOD OF THE LABYRINTH but never seems to get very far. At this point, I refer you to Jorge Luis Borges' story entitled \\"A Survey of the Works of Herbert Quain,\\" who is, together with his book, wholly fictional.<br />In the midst of all these in-jokes, the amazing thing is that you can read YEAR OF THE DEATH without knowing of them and still regard it as one of the greatest works of fiction written in the last century. Ricardo Reis is a brilliant creation (whoever's it is), and Saramago brings him to life and sets him wandering the streets of Lisbon and agonizing about his love life and about whether he is to take up his medical practice or just retire. We see him from his point of view, from Pessoa's, from a hotel manager's, from the police's, and even from his neighbors and a couple of old men who hang out in the park across the street. What emerges is the most multidimensional characters in all of literature.<br />In the meantime, Europe is blowing up all around him. Spain erupts in civil war; Hitler's Germany invades the Sudetenland and begins threatening Danzig; and Mussolini has just completed a splendid conquest of Ethiopia. Little Portugal seems proud of its dictator Salazar, who was to continue for another thirty years, and hopes to get into the act, but can't decide what color its adherents should wear. The Nazis had brown; the Italians, black; and the Falangists, blue. (They finally settle on green.)<br />There are as many news items in YEAR OF THE DEATH as in John Dos Passos's USA trilogy. Saramago's political news and views drip with irony: The Portuguese are innocents about to view a vast bloodbath that spreads from its border with Spain to the steppes of Russia, but it hasn't occurred yet.<br />This is the second Saramago novel I have read, but by no means the last.ntime, Europe is blowing up all around him.

After having read it, I know no more than if I had read the Encyclopedia Britannica entry for Giordano Bruno. I was not only uninformed but bored as well. The only reason I finished the book at all is that I couldn't believe that the author went so far with so little data.<br />Firstly, I would like to know more about Giordano Bruno's contribution to Renaissance thought. Although some Italian sources were referenced in the notes and bibliography, I am not convinced that White actually tackled them himself. Secondly, I would not have minded some more apropos quotes from Bruno himself -- even if it meant padding the book a bit -- anything but the endless repetition of a few basic biographical facts.<br />It appears that Michael White has written other books on the general subject of scientific history, books that garnered some decent reviews. I sincerely hope that this was just an odd lapsus menti and not the sign of a fourth-rate biographer.	2003-07-21

It was like nothing that the original Thirteen Colonies ever saw, and it was but a foretaste of the rampant multiculturalism that has become a dominant feature of our lives.<br />Did you know that the first impulse to secession was not in the South, but in Massachusetts? The \\"Essex Junto,\\" dating as far back as 1786, allowed itself to be influenced by Spain for purely regional benefits. As late as the Hartford Convention in 1815, the threat of secession was primarily a Yankee threat; only later did the South adopt it.<br />Jefferson, Livingston, and Monroe tread on new ground in cutting the deal: There was nothing in the new Constitution to allow them such powers, nor was there anything that expressly forbade it. And no sooner was the deal made than the United States began to face new problems, such as the expansion of slavery in the new territories. It was the Purchase that led in an almost direct line to the Missouri Compromise of 1820; and from there, to the Dred Scott Decision; and from there to the horrors of the War Between the States.<br />Kukla's book can be read on several levels. I read it as an exciting tale of diplomacy between the United States, Spain, and France spanning twenty years. As a work of scholarship, it contains extensive but unobtrusive endnotes, maps, and appendices containing the texts of the 1795 treaty with Spain, the Louisiana Purchase Treaty and Conventions, and some draft amendments to the Constitution proposed by Jefferson in 1803 to legitimize the Purchase.<br />I did not expect much from this book at first, but Kukla was so successful in working in threads and themes that continue to this day, that the book is highly relevant and thought provoking. It is odd to call a book about diplomacy gripping, but any tale that weaves together Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, Toussaint L'Ouverture (the Black Haitian revolutionary), Talleyrand, and Napoleon Bonaparte so well can be described in no other way.appendices containing the texts of the 1795 treaty with Spain, the Louisiana Purchase Treaty and Conventions, and some draft amendments to the Constitution proposed by Jefferson in 1803 to legitimize the Purchase.<br />I did not expect much from this book at first, but Kukla was so successful in working in threads and themes that continue to this day, that the book is highly relevant and thought provoking.

Everything goes to hell when Cobra Box, her associate, goes to Bad Leopard, Idaho, to buy guns. Nobody ultimately gets together with anybody: just overheated bodies caroming around in a ranchero beat with the occasional gratuitous sex or violence. As Cairo Fly put it in his diary that closes the book, \\"Is it possible for a person's soul to stray away or be stolen and without it the person has no peace in their heart? I feel I am one of those now.\\"<br />There is something mesmerizing about Gifford's staccato chapters. Try too hard to follow the story, and you wind up like Thankful Priest with a bullet in your head in some godforsaken south of the border hellhole. No, man, just keep going to the beat.

As a son of La Malinche (see his LABYRINTH OF SOLITUDE), he maintained a clearheaded sense of balance while his contemporaries were losing their heads over communism, surrealism, existentialism, and all the other isms that characterized that time.<br />What has always amazed me that Paz was at one and the same time both a truthsayer and a poet. Even to someone like myself whose Spanish is less than idiomatic, his poetry possesses a beauty and limpidity that are almost never met in combination. Only Emily Dickinson of the poets I know has this quality. One of my favorites is the poem \\"Epitafio sobre ninguna piedra\\" from which the title of this review is taken.<br />Now that communism is all but extinct, one forgets that only a short while ago it held so many intellectuals in thrall. Looking at our situation today, Paz concludes that \\"if I am sure of one thing it is that we are living an interregnum; we are walking across a zone whose ground is not solid; its foundations, it basis has evaporated. If we wish to climb free from the marsh and not sink into mud we should quickly work out a morality and a politics.\\" I think that, as a people, we have not. I am reminded of Yeats's \\"The Second Coming\\":<br />The best lack all conviction<br />While the worst are full of passionate intensity<br />A final word: Toward the end is a beautiful little essay entitled \\"Imaginary Gardens: A Memoir\\" which, while responding negatively to a proposal for a public park, lets loose a Proustian flood of memory regarding the past of the town where Paz was raised, Mixcoac.<br />This little book, which can be read in a single sitting, deserves a wide readership.

There is something effortless about the way Catton integrates his sources and spins his tale.<br />If one may say he is not really a scholar, he is at least a brilliant popularizer and integrater. REFLECTIONS is like the capstone of his career. Now that I've read scores of books on the subject, Catton somehow manages to revivify the entire period.<br />By far my favorite chapter is the story of an Army Engineer who also created a sketchbook of his battle experiences. Catton follows him thoughout the war and even after, until his later years are spent in pain from an injury received in battle decades before. Also brilliant is is short summary of the war from the point of view of opportunities lost. (It appears that the commanding generals of the Army of the Potomac have a lot to answer for.)<br />If you want a single book to give you a good feeling of what the Civil War was like without dragging you company by company through all the gory details, this is the book for you.<br />There are many great writers about the Civil War, but I definitely feel that, now that Catton has gone, the vital spark is no longer there.	2003-06-15

But, as the author is Umberto Eco, it means that a whole lot of other things are going on as well. Baudolino is a barely literate Northern Italian peasant who somehow a close friend of Frederick I Barbarossa, the 12th Century Holy Roman Emperor. He feels grateful to his emperor, and strives to take his leadership to the next level, by an embassy to the lost Christian realm of Prester John. As a suitable gift to the mythical ruler, Baudolino takes an old drinking cup of his father's and calls it the Holy Grail.<br />Frederick goes along with the whole scheme -- anything to escape those endless wars with the petty Northern Italian states -- and sets out to the East. History states that Frederick drowned while crossing a river enroute to the Third Crusade. Eco invents a classical locked-room mystery to account for the emperor's death, and late in the book provides a neat answer that also satisfies the historians.<br />The whole story is told to a Byzantine official whom Baudolino saves. While they escape the ravages of the Fourth Crusade with its sacking of Constantinople, Baudolino spins an incredible tale encompassing much of the medieval bestiary and then some. On one hand, he is the most incredible liar who never lived: His kingdom of Prester John is located in one of those eternally disgruntled Muslim states of Central Asia in which, if there were ever any unicorns, they were long served as shish-kebabs.<br />There is a story about Freud and a mythical patient who spins out a long story for the great psychologist. \\"That's very interesting,\\" said Freud. When the patient admits that the whole story was bogus, the response was, \\"That's even more interesting!\\"<br />Baudolino IS the Middle Ages personified, except for the minor detail that he is not much of a believer in this age of faith. Where the old maps say, \\"there be dragons here,\\" Baudolino shows you the dragons. Perhaps, a more true statement is that Baudolino is the Medieval Imagination personified. Bogus or not, he created worlds within worlds that are endlessly enthralling. Be prepared for a wild ride in what must be one of the best books written in the last ten years.audolino is the Medieval Imagination personified.

This tale is a psychological thriller that does not let you breathe until the last line.<br />The final tale -- &quot;Because of the Dollars&quot; -- is my favorite. It reminds me of ALMAYER'S FOLLY and OUTPOST OF THE ISLANDS with its shallow-draft vessels penetrating into the heart of remote islands. Captain Davidson is a classic Conrad hero caught in a trap: How he manages to escape it at the cost of a wife who doesn't love him and, by the way, his ability to smile is one of the author's most perfectly taut stories.<br />It is amusing to read Conrad's preface to the stories: He seems to be wincing excessively in response to early criticism after circulating the stories to his friends. Needless to say, his friends were over-critical: WITHIN THE TIDES struck me as a treasure that I had somehow overlooked all these years.	2003-06-11
US	53092736	RE3L7AWDW7CP9	067101983X	594874910	Black Betty	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Dead Heat	Raymond Chandler made the definitive statement about L.A.'s Santa Ana Winds at the beginning of his short story \\"Red Wind.\\" In Easy Rawlins' L.A., the hot, dry winds that fill the lungs with cactus dust and make the skin peel around the fingernails never seem to stop.<br />Easy is in search of an erotic dream woman from his childhood who is being sought by one of those rich white families who have more skeletons than clothes in their closets. Around the same time, the very dangerous Raymond \\"Mouse\\" Alexander is released from the pen; and Easy's attempt to make a killing in the real estate market run up against a brick wall.<br />There are plot threads aplenty, and enough characters to fill a passenger liner. Mosley is too good a writer to leave any threads untied, but I do get lost at times with some of the characters. One bad dude is not heard from for a hundred pages when he commits a particularly heinous murder at the very end. \\"Oh, yeah, wasn't he the guy that ...?\\" Sometimes, I would have welcomed the list of characters, complete with nicknames, that occasionally accompanies an 800-page Russian novel.<br />What makes this a minor complaint is that Mosley has such a great sense of place and so much feeling for his characters. We don't meet the character he calls \\"Black Betty\\" until the end of the novel, but we keep seeing vignettes from Easy's past that keep building up the suspense, and any expectations are more than fulfilled by an ending that is bloodier than the last act of Hamlet.	2003-05-25

My favorite example of this is Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP: I have read the book and seen the movie multiple times, and still have difficulty sorting it all out. Some of Dickens' work falls into this category, as well as some recent mysteries, such as AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST.<br />If the ultimate measures of a work of fiction are that you care about the people and you want to know what happens next, then SMILLA is a masterpiece. To this, I would have to add the novel's sense of place: Copenhagen and the sea off the West Coast of Greenland are sketched in few but deft strokes.<br />Ultimately, it is Smilla herself who is the star attraction. Half Dane, half Inuit (Eskimo), she thinks like a little of both. The Danish half is something of a scientist, while the Inuit half has a sense of snow and ice that is alien to anyone south of the Arctic Circle. While afraid of water, Smilla thinks nothing of taking a stroll on the ice in the harbor of Copenhagen, instinctively sidestepping weaknesses which would plunge her toward an icy [demise].<br />Not since LA FEMME NIKITA have I seen such a dangerous woman in a fight. Her quick disabling of her father's girlfriend Benja and an over-inquisitive crewman aboard the ship KRONOS are memorable. At the same time, her feelings for the Inuit boy Isaac are sincere and credible, such that I almost felt as if the author were female.<br />On the other hand, the ending is not satisfying -- a little too Indiana Jones-y for my taste -- and that while Hoeg's characterization of the main characters is on the mark, he creates too many subsidiary characters, particularly in the Denmark scenes, and too many complications from which to extricate himself successfully.<br />That being said, I look forward to see the direction that Hoeg takes with his future works. Sure it's not perfect, but it's such a fun read that it'll whet your appetite for more.tite for more.	2003-05-13

Carlos Fuentes had a brief but tempestuous affair with actress Jean Seberg over thirty years ago. The encounter seems to have marked him, for this book is a barely disguised roman a clef (where Diana Soren = Jean Seberg) about his relationship. It is like one of those European stories where the man gives up everything to follow some vixen, including his money, family, and peace of mind. Luis Bunuel (who actually appears in this novel as a character) created the ultimate masterpiece of the genre with his film THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE.<br />Jean Seberg has come down to us today as a tortured sado-masochistic saint who still has the power to beguile men. Film posters and stills featuring her and her movies command a premium in today's cinememorabilia market; and I know several collectors who seek out anything they can find depicting her. Perhaps, what Marilyn Monroe was for the 1950s, Jean Seberg was for the 1960s.<br />Why Fuentes wrote this novel in the way he did puzzles me. If I were as obsessed as he was, I would still feel queasy about exposing the dirty bedsheets and underwear to the gaze of the public. To me, love -- however brief or unhappy -- is a gift of the gods; and by spiting it, one shows oneself to be somehow unworthy. Fuentes has flouted a gift whose memory I would have locked away in the deepest recesses of my being and thrown away the key.<br />If, however, Fuentes feels himself to have been traduced by his relationship, like Charles Swann at the end of Proust's SWANN'S WAY after his recognition of Odette's unfaithfulness, I could understand his need to exorcise this \\"expense of spirit in a waste of shame.\\"<br />Instead, I see both the anger and the gratefulness simultaneously. As a result, DIANA THE GODDESS WHO HUNTS ALONE leaves me with a feeling of unease, as if the author did not know his own mind and went off in several emotional directions at once.<br />The result is a very well written book that in the end does not quite jell. One can't worship at the shrine and spit at it at the same time.t worship at the shrine and spit at it at the same time.	2003-05-10

He is also a respectable novelist and the author of an authoritative three-volume history of the Civil War from the point of view of the South.<br />STARS IN THEIR COURSES is an even-handed look at the three days' battle that some think was the decisive struggle of the long conflict. At least, it would have been had it not been for Lee's rapid, orderly retreat and Meade's disinclination to face him in battle again so soon. If the more decisive Grant were in charge at that early date, the war would have drawn to a quick conclusion.<br />As a big fan of Ted Turner's GETTYSBURG, I was surprised to see that the movie took at least as much from Foote as from Michael Shaara's THE KILLER ANGELS. Foote produces a more all-encompassing view of the battle than the film, which omits Ewell's actions on the Union right as well as the battle's immediate aftermath.<br />My only complaint about the Modern Library edition is that the maps scattered throughout the text bear no captions. The reader has to check the List of Maps in the back of the book to find out where (and when) he is on the battlefield. An index would also have been useful.<br />But these are mere peccadillos considering Foote's high level of scholarship and engaging prose style. This book is a keeper.	2003-05-10

Auteurist critic Andrew Sarris classified Billy Wilder in his \\"Less Than Meets the Eye Category,\\" primarily because he was \\"too cynical for the more serious demands of middle-class tragedy (DOUBLE INDEMNITY) and social allegory (ACE IN THE HOLE). A director who can crack jokes about suicide attempts ... and thoughtlessly brutalize charming actresses like Jean Arthur (FOREIGN AFFAIR) and Audrey Hepburn (SABRINA) is hardly likely to make a coherent film on the human condition.\\"<br />It was only as a result of seeing Wilder's films that I discovered what Sarris was really saying was that the director was both too versatile and too successful -- and it didn't help that his approach to directing films was as a writer rather than as a visual artist.<br />Reading Charlotte Chandler's oral history of Wilder's career, I was impressed with Billy Wilder's ability to be able to create iconic native masterpieces of film noir (DOUBLE INDEMNITY) and Hollywood Gothic (SUNSET BOULEVARD) without the benefit of growing up in the United States. While his later comedies (such as SOME LIKE IT HOT) owe much to his collaboration with Lubitsch, Hawks, and Mitchell Leisen, Wilder developed his own style of comedy and retained his ability to make good films well into his eighties.<br />In the chapter on SUNSET BOULEVARD, actress Nancy Olson makes an astute comment: \\"Billy said, 'Every character in SUNSET BOULEVARD is an opportunist.' It seemed to me that what he is saying is that this picture is not only about opportunism, but about ... the consequences of it.\\"<br />A little light bulb went on in my mind. Wilder's films are all, in their own way, about opportunism. Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson take advantage of each other for their own nefarious ends in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. In picture after picture, I see a pattern of characters using one another with interesting results, with the ultimate example being Kirk Douglas in ACE IN THE HOLE.<br />Chandler's interviews are mostly interesting, though the intrusion of plot summaries in the middle of each chapter is intrusive: These should have been relegated to the Filmography in the back of the book. I was disturbed that Chandler did not see fit to add any of her own observations about Wilder except insofar as to provide a segue for the many quotes. Still, it is both a useful and entertaining book and a valuable addition to the literature about this fascinating filmmaker.th the ultimate example being Kirk Douglas in ACE IN THE HOLE. <br />Chandler's interviews are mostly interesting, though the intrusion of plot summaries in the middle of each chapter is intrusive: These should have been relegated to the Filmography in the back of the book.

Graham Greene thrusts us into one of his moral quagmires in which the crabwise scuttling of his narrator comes up against the straightforward thrusts of the dangerously naive.<br />Thomas Fowler is a British journal in Saigon during the 1950s, when the French were fighting Vietnamese Communist insurgents before the United States inherited that mess after the battle of Dien Bien Phu. He comes upon Arden Pyle, the Quiet American of the title, a man almost too innocent to live. (At one point, Greene writes that \\"innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.\\") While purporting to be an economic consultant, he is actually an American agent attempting to apply simplistic principles to a tangled situation that is beyond his understanding.<br />In the process, he snags Fowler's Vietnamese mistress while pretending to remain the journalist's friend. Although he seems to be invulnerable in his innocence for a while, the quagmire finally claims him as a victim. He is very like one of Conrad's \\"pilgrims\\" in THE HEART OF DARKNESS, cool and elegant in their pursuit of nefarious colonial pursuits to the very end.<br />The \\"illegitimate process\\" may be a good description of Pyle's work, but Graham Greene's ever-present \\"malpractice of heart\\" is seen in Fowler, the French police inspector Vigot, the mistress Phuong's sister, Fowler's fellow journalist Bill Granger, and the suspicious Mr Heng.<br />At one point, Fowler wonders, \\"Wouldn't we all do better not trying to understand, accepting the fact that no human being will ever understand another, not a wife a husband, a lover a mistress, nor a parent a child? Perhaps that's why men have invented God -- a being capable of understanding.\\" And, I might add, of forgiving.<br />This is one of Graham Greene's most outstanding works, on a par with THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE HEART OF THE MATTER, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and A BURN-OUT CASE. Curiously, it seems almost as current as if it were written yesterday instead of half a century ago.THE HEART OF THE MATTER, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and A BURN-OUT CASE.

Crumb have the same anguished yearning for determined young women. Curiously, these all have the strong legs, broad beams, and statuesque torsos of Crumb's fantasy women from Zap Comix to today. Perhaps, Crumb and Kafka have more in common than meets the eye.<br />They are all there: Gregor Samsa's sister, the luscious Milena Jesenska, the Advocate's \\"nurse\\" Leni, Olga and Frieda from THE CASTLE, and the ravishing Dora Diamant. These women are all more durable than both Kafka and Crumb, who are wispy and likely to blow away in the next puff of wind. (I recommend that you see the excellent film documentary of the cartoonist's life, called, appropriately, CRUMB.)<br />When one concentrates on the women in Kafka's life and work, the result is curiously enlightening. \\"None of his female characters seems to have her own existence,\\" writes David Zane Mairowitz, \\"but is spawned in his imagination in order to distract 'K' or 'Joseph K,' to tempt and ensnare him. Kafka's sexual terror is put to the test time after time, yet these same women provide something more.... The outcome of these relationships is rarely 'intimate' (Leni being an exception) and has more to do with power than personal feelings. Kafka's talent would mostly SUGGEST erotic encounter, rather than indulging his characters in that act which he found 'repellent and perfectly useless.'\\"<br />Perhaps Mairowitz and Crumb do not provide a measured and scholarly study of the writer, but within a mere 175 pages they have done more to rekindle my interest in Kafka than anything else I have ever read about him. This book is a perfect gem and a work of art in its own right.	2003-04-27

Bernard Lewis, a Professor Emeritus in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University, has created yet another incredibly useful and timely book from articles he wrote for the New Yorker, Foreign Affairs, the Atlantic Monthly, and other publications.<br />THE CRISIS OF ISLAM -- even more than its excellent predecessor WHAT WENT WRONG? -- is both cohesive and spot-on. All nine chapters as well as the introduction are informed by the events of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath. The final chapter, for instance, deals directly with the subject of suicide bombers, discussing the Qur'an's ban on both suicide and murder of innocent civilians, and going on to discuss the \\"martyrs\\" of Hammas and the Al-Aqsa Brigades as a form of death cult that goes against the teachings of Islam.<br />I was particularly intrigued by Lewis's reference to some remarks made by Osama bin Laden regarding the \\"humiliation and disgrace\\" Islam has suffered for over eighty years. He refers specifically to the abolition of the Caliphate by Kemal Ataturk and his followers in 1924. For the first time since the days of Muhammad, Islam was without a leader. Lewis suggests that Osama would not be averse to the role himself -- which would be roughly equivalent to making Jeffrey Dahmer the headmaster of a boys' school.<br />The chapter entitled \\"A Failure of Modernity\\" gives striking evidence of the backwardness of most Islamic nations. A 2002 United Nations report states that \\"the Arab World translates about 330 books annually, one-fifth of the number that Greece translates. The accumulative total of translated books since [the ninth century] is about 100,000, almost the average that Spain translates in one year.\\" If we in the West have been accused of the oddest things at times, it is because ignorance of the West is endemic. And, I might add, dangerous.<br />In order to avoid falling into the same trap ourselves -- such as by getting all our information from \\"The O'Reilly Report\\" -- we owe it to ourselves to know why over a billion Muslims have decided that we are the Great Satan.

In my reading, I have always attempted at times to cross the mainstream and see what lies beyond. Iceland is as far from the mainstream as you can get and still be part of Western Culture. What we sometimes forget is that almost a thousand years ago, Iceland was a literary giant; and some of the sagas that came from that island are among the greatest works of literature ever written.<br />Laxness is therefore the recipient of a great tradition. Sadly, Iceland -- after discovering Greenland and North America and giving them up as a bad lot -- became a colony of Norway, and later of Denmark. The loss of hegemony coupled with the horrendous disasters of a mini ice age and catastrophic volcanic explosions led to a grinding poverty that drained the mind and spirit.<br />WORLD LIGHT is at one and the same time the greatest Laxness novel I have read and also the most difficult. Its hero, the poet Olaf Karason of Ljosavik, is born into poverty and spends his youth as a foster child in a home utterly lacking in love. After being kicked out, he moves to Svidinskvik, where he becomes a ward of the parish. He writes poems in support of local Danish bigwig, Peter Palsson, whose grandiloquent &quot;Rehabilitation Company&quot; is behind a series of mostly abortive moves to improve the town's economy and morale. The young poet is so feckless that it is difficult to identify with him, but as the story progressed, I began to see his flaws writ large over the entire landscape.<br />The cigar-chomping Danes go around either claiming &quot;I'm no Icelander, s'help me!&quot; or attempting to prove themselves the most patriotic Icelanders of all. We see Olaf's attempts at finding himself with an incredible array of characters, including Juel Juel Juel of Grim Hairycheek Ltd, Eternity-Dave (who only has three expressions: &quot;Jesus&quot; ... &quot;My Brother!&quot; ... &quot;Heave up!&quot;), a succession of women who share his bed and drive him to distraction, and a supporting cast large and odd enough to populate a Dickens novel.<br />I did say earlier that I found this Laxness's most difficult novel. It is difficult to know where the author is headed, though at the same time I kept getting drawn into the complex plot with its thick undergrowth of transitory characters. In the end, I saw Olaf's fecklessness being mirrored in the fecklessness of the Danish colonial administration, and the fecklessness of a pre-Independence Iceland that felt lost, and indeed of all human beings cast adrift upon the waters into a cruel world that mocks the life of the spirit and ends all too soon in disorder and early sorrow.<br />The translator of this edition, Magnus Magnusson, writes a beautiful clear English (that also comes across in his Icelandic saga translations). British readers may remember him as the TV host of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;<br />You will not be disappointed with WORLD LIGHT if you just persevere.

Rhea marshals an impressive mass of detail about the events between Ulysses S Grant's movement from the lines on the North Anna River to the end of the Battle of Cold Harbor proper on June 3, 1864. I have heard many of the opinions about the battle ranging from the judgment of Grant as an unfeeling butcher on a large scale to Rhea's revisionist approach, which puts the casualties into some perspective for the campaign and the war as a whole.<br />The title of my review, which comes from a quote by Lt Col Charles Cummings of the 17th Vermont, is a good description of the main battle. Cold Harbor looks forward to the grim battle lines of the First World War, where men dug in and ventured from their trenches at their peril. As the war went on, the veteran troops on both sides learned to dig in. It was the gung-ho new regiments from the North that had the heaviest casualties: They had not yet developed the basic survival skills.<br />Rhea's study went in for such heavy detail that at times, I yearned for an occasional editorial perspective, which this author pretty much restricted to the first and last chapters.<br />Robert E Lee came out relatively unsinged from Cold Harbor, but Grant has taken much of the blame for the unfortunate general staff culture of the Army of the Potomac. Remember that it was only a short time before that he took over the command, and he had to make do with prima donnas like Meade -- who comes off particularly badly -- as well as Burnside, Warren, and Wright. Even Baldy Smith, Grant's friend whom he had rescued from the country club atmosphere of Butler's command at Bermuda Hundred, spent most of the time (though somewhat justifiably) complaining about lack of food and ammunition, and contradictory commands from the top.<br />After I finished reading this book, I looked up Grant's own memoirs and saw an interesting bit that Rhea omits entirely: After the battle, there was an exchange of letters between Grant and Lee (which Grant quotes verbatim) in which the Union general requests a truce to collect the dead and wounded. Lee refused repeatedly, until several days later, by which time only two of the many thousands wounded left on the battlefield survived. This is a serious charge and should be addressed in any book on Cold Harbor, if only to dismiss it. Perhaps Rhea will put it in his next volume?<br />I was enchanted by Lee's inherent ability to create good ground for a battle by his knowledge of the countryside and his superior relationship to his staff officers. He was for certain a formidable and great adversary. Grant, on his side, was walking on eggshells.

When you look at them with the eyes half-closed, they are almost fetching if you are feeling somewhat peckish; but alpha males just continue scanning for more promising material. (If the preceding sentence strikes you as callous, you may be wound up too tight to read this book.)<br />That Oates can take seemingly unpromising material like Kathleen Hennessy and, while being true to her subject, manages to show that, for many, life on earth hasn't risen far enough. The daughter of an abusive father and a runaway mother, Kathleen finds herself in a series of foster homes in the Detroit area, growing up hoping to become a nurse but ending up as a nurse's aide. She manages to attract a young physician named Orson Abbott, but the relationship progresses no further than her pregnancy.<br />Without giving away the ending, I can only say that Kathleen's solution to her problem is simple, methodical, and great material for a supermarket tabloid spread. In fact, certain events occur almost in passing that would make for a great cover story in the NATIONAL ENQUIRER.<br />Oates is second only to Anton Chekhov in her ability to take a seemingly uncomplicated person and show us depths we had never before imagined. Why, I wonder, is she not given the honor she deserves? I think many readers take her for granted because she is so prolific and writes mostly about women. Duh, so did Jane Austen!	2003-04-03

The entire border is a huge Zone of Distortion warped by the looming proximity of the Giant to the North. I felt it as far south as Los Mochis, Durango and Chihuahua, and did not feel entirely free of it until I got to Guanajuato and Queretaro.<br />Poor Hector Belascoaran Shayne has been knifed, shot at, and even left for dead -- but Paco Taibo keeps bringing him back for more. In this case, it is childhood crush Natalia Smith-Corona, an actress whose daughter has reported her missing and sends the stout detective on a hallucinogenic chase among the narcotraficantes, DEA agents, ambiguous chiefs of police, 300 whores from Zacatecas, and other loonies -- the worst of whom is a right winger named Quayle (sadly, no relation to the former vice president).<br />FRONTERA DREAMS is not quite linear in its organization, resembling at times some of those strange Italian spy movies of the 1960s that capitalized on the James Bond craze. If you don't like the feeling of not knowing where you are going, this novel will not please you.<br />On the other hand, if you see it as a shaggy dog story that, as it moves rapidly from one location to the next, gives you some feeling of the strangeness of El Border, you might enjoy it as much as I have. This is my third Shayne novel, and I look forward to reading all of them, if only someone would come along and translate the first of the series (DIAS DE COMBATE) into English.	2003-03-31

Around the time that Israel was born, he took the fall for the increasing unpopularity of British forces from both sides -- Arab and Jew -- and was let go by the late King Hussein.<br />Far from being embittered by the experience, Glubb went on to write a number of exciting histories, an autobiography, and this life of Muhammad. In a way, it is good that this book is over 30 years old: It is untouched by any reference to September 11 and allows the reader an unprejudiced view of the Prophet and his followers without rancour or prejudice of any sort. At one point, the author states that he is a Christian, but feels as completely at home with sincere Muslims as with his fellow Christians.<br />Three features make this a particularly useful book. For one thing, there are a dozen excellent maps. For those of us who have difficulty distinguishing from Arabic name from another, there are summaries of Notable Dates and Personalities at the end of each chapter to help fix the facts in the reader's memory. Finally, there is a respectable bibliography for further study.<br />I was particularly gratified with Glubb's final paragraph, which very much speaks to us today: \\"If we Christians believe that we are more nearly executing the will of God than are adherents of other religions, it must surely be our duty to lead such lives as will draw all men of good will to ask the reason for our goodness. To treat them with arrogant contempt is more likely to convince them that ours is an intolerant and hard-hearted way of life.\\" To which I can only add, Amen!	2003-03-12

Is it the educational system? the Commonwealth background? the adoption of English as a unifying language in a country that has so many languages? I wish I knew.<br />Years ago, I started by reading R K Narayan at the suggestion of none other than Graham Greene. The more Indian fiction I read (Desai, Jhabvala, Roy, Seth), the more I became convinced that perhaps we must look to India for great English literature.<br />I picked A FINE BALANCE up at the library and took it home because there was something about the book's cover that caught my eye. Needless to say, I was hooked by the richness of the book, which rivals Dickens in its multiplicity of characters and the love that is lavished on each minor character.<br />This is a story of a young widow who takes in boarders and starts a home business to become independent of her controlling brother. We begin with two lower-caste tailors who escape from an oppressive village life to work for the widow, then the student who is to become her boarder, then the widow Dina herself. We travel back in time to see their lives up to that point, and then we are launched into the uncertainties of the present.<br />A note: This is the India of Indira Gandhi around 1975-1980. Before her assassination, she instituted a number of Potemkin-style &quot;reforms&quot; that caused widespread suffering among the poor. At a number of points, her characters are ripped untimely from their everyday lives to create political theater that makes the powers that be look good to their Congress Party supporters.<br />One of the minor characters is the wandering Vasantrao Valmik, a former proofreader into whose mouth Mistry puts his own thoughts about life. &quot;There is no such thing as an uninteresting life,&quot; he tells the student at the end of the book. He urges him to tell him his complete story, &quot;unabridged and unexpurgated.&quot; He continues: &quot;It's extremely important because it helps to remind yourself of who you are. Then you can go forward, without fear of losing yourself in this ever-changing world.&quot;<br />One feels that Mistry, who now lives in Canada, uses writing to help remind himself of who he is. He brings his unnamed city -- which is undoubtedly Bombay -- to life with all its smells, its peeling paint, its worms in the shower drain, and its wealth of poor, but colorful characters.<br />Colorful, yes, but also sad. Not everyone comes off well, even though you the reader may come to love these characters, and God knows I did, be prepared for many reverses. Although life is a game played for keeps, the love we meet along the way makes it all worthwhile.<br />Rohinton Mistry is a major talent, and A FINE BALANCE is a great book.emely important because it helps to remind yourself of who you are.

The title story (&quot;Shifu, You'll Do Anything for a Laugh&quot;) is a delightful tale of an unemployed factory worker who gets incredibly creative and makes out like a bandit until he meets some clients that are out of this world. The Chinese director Zhang Yimou made turned this story into a film called HAPPY DAYS.<br />Other than the opener, my favorite stories are &quot;Abandoned Child,&quot; which makes a strong statement about the continuing practice of female infanticide; &quot;Love Story,&quot; about an unlikely love affair set in the countryside; the strange fantasty &quot;Iron Child&quot; about a possible outcome of over-industrialization; and the incredibly poetic &quot;Man and Beast,&quot; which the author claims is a sequel to his novel RED SORGHUM (although I missed some of the references, I was enthralled).<br />In his preface, Mo Yan (which, by the way, is Chinese for &quot;Don't Speak&quot;) says his muses were hunger and loneliness. In fact, the author has a unique rapport with the lives of peasants and workers, as opposed to many more intellectual writers in exile such as Gao Xingjiang. I have already read THE GARLIC BALLADS and plan to read more of this fascinating writer.	2003-03-05

Dick reaches all the way back to Jonathan Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal\\" and all the way forward to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.<br />To jape is to cut up, to spoof outrageously a la Monty Python. Dick's hero, Allen Purcell, is about to assume the most powerful media position on the planet; at the same time, he is in fear of being imminently arrested for a jape involving the mutilation of a monument to Morec's beloved founder, the infamous Major Streiter.<br />Morec is short for Moral Reclamation, a kind of Moral Majority Heaven on Earth in which any offenses -- most particularly of the sexual variety -- trigger vicious Maoist self-criticism meetings culminating in the loss of one's apartment lease. And without a lease, there's nowhere to go but the outer planets.<br />Philip K. Dick weaves in a number of themes masterfully, from the devastation following a nuclear holocaust to the \\"Health Resort,\\" a scheme for processing those who crack under the strain of Morec. There are juveniles everywhere (not what you think), not to mention the Cohorts, Active Assimilation, the Domino Method, \\"nooses,\\" and the usual panoply of brilliant Dick inventions, such as all food dishes being enclosed in quotes, as in \\"His 'eggs' were cooling on the plate.\\"<br />There are arresting throwaway lines such as when the character of Sue Frost is introduced: \\"Her eyes, he noticed, were an almost colorless straw. A strong kind of substance, and highly polished.\\"<br />Although he has been compared to Borges and Kafka, Dick is very much an American original. THE MAN WHO JAPED's unusual combination of paranoia and a wicked sense of humor is unique, as if Orwell's Winston Smith in 1984 were played by John Cleese.	2003-02-16

Feel the mounting frustration, the fear and loathing. Not once, not a dozen times, not seven times seventy times. But every waking moment of every day.<br />What Chester Himes does in this first volume of his autobiography is to make you, the reader, feel that frustration. You can see how it worked its way into Chester Himes's work, his relationships, even between the pores of his skin. It explodes into self-destructiveness when he is arrested and convicted for armed robbery, serving a seven and a half year sentence in the Ohio Penitentiary. When he could take it no more, he escapes to Europe. He spends time in France, England, and Spain and finds some few places where he could be a man without arousing strong antipathy.<br />The early scenes in the United States have a frenetic quality about them, as Himes is always on the move. \\"And although I did not it at that time, I was never to stop moving, always one jump ahead of disaster, always a hair's breadth away from destitution; until I can truthfully say there has been nothing in my life but change.\\" (p. 293)<br />The second half of the book deals with his relationship with a white women named Alva whom he had met on the boat ride over to Europe. From Paris, they move to Arcachon, and then to London -- where the prejudice is so thick you could cut it with a knife -- and from thence to Mallorca and finally back again to Arcachon and Paris. All this takes place before the success of his Harlem detective novels with Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson.<br />\\"The American black is a new race of man ...,\\" he writes on p. 285. \\"And for those hackneyed, diehard, outdated, slaverytime racists to keep thinking of him as a primitive is an insult to the intelligence. In fact, intelligence isn't required to know the black is a new man -- complex, intriguing, and not particularly likeable. I find it very difficult to like American blacks myself....\\"<br />There is something rough-hewn and brutally honest about Himes that I've always liked.

Imagine a high class brothel of the future -- located, as I recall, at an airport. The client requests an assignation and draws a prostitute who all but rapes him. He tries to open a conversation with her, but she is all action and no talk. The client protests to the management and draws another one who dresses in frills like a character from Jane Austen and recites romantic poetry. You've probably already guessed what happens: This one is all talk and no action.<br />I yield to no one in my admiration of Balzac, whom I consider one of the greatest story-tellers of all time. It is very obvious that the character of Madame Blanche-Henriette de Mortsauf meant something special to the author in his life: Her piety and fine-tuned sensibility, however, don't come across well in our time. Women who suffer endlessly and fritter their lives away in sighs tend to give rise to a frustrated &quot;Oh, come off it already!&quot;<br />The opposite of Mme de Mortsauf is the fascinating Arabelle, Marchionesse of Dudley, who conquers the narrator, Felix de Vandenesse, and keeps him in thrall with &quot;caresses never before enjoyed by any man.&quot; Alas, Balzac uses the multi-talented Arabelle primarily as a warning to all Frenchmen how cold-hearted the British are. We are tantalized but far from fulfilled.<br />Call me a dirty old man, if you will, but I would rather that Balzac and Felix spent more time with Dudley and a whole lot less with Mme de Mortsauf. As it is, the latter dies horribly of her excessive sensibility, and Felix walks away from her grave resolved to live a life of which the angelic Mme de Mortsauf would have approved.<br />We all know that Balzac made no such resolution in his own life. Despite his monkish pretensions, the author spent all his life pursuing women. When, after a multi-year courtship, he finally snared his Countess, he died within a year.<br />It sounds as if I did not like LILY OF THE VALLEY. Far from it, I liked it a great deal; but do not see it as one of the author's more successful works. And yet, even at his worst, Balzac is better than most writers at their best, as when Felix muses &quot;I loved an angel and a demon, equally beautiful, one of them adorned with all the virtues which hatred of our imperfections induces us to hurt; the other with all the vices which our selfishness prompts us to deify.&quot; Read it and judge for yourself.<br />It sounds as if I did not like LILY OF THE VALLEY.

You could be in for some scintillating conversation, or just as likely for embarassed silence or a dose of that gold-plated chip on the shoulder. At one point in a restaurant, Greene stands up and makes a loud public announcement that some poor tourist was eavesdropping on his conversation. Another time, he publicly berates the author's husband, translator Francis Steegmuller, for feeding stray cats.<br />For over 40 years, Graham Greene spent Spring and Autumn at his villa in Anacapri. During much of that time, Shirley Hazzard and Steegmuller were also in attendance and struck up as close a friendship as that truculent Englishman would allow. Rather than a formal biography, GREENE ON CAPRI is a delightfully impressionistic book about Greene, the island they all held in common (though Green knew astonishingly little about its history), and the famous literary visitors whose lives partially intersected, most notably Harold Acton and Norman Douglas.<br />As I am planning a visit to Capri in the foreseeable future, I was pleasantly surprised how much information about the island and its history is conveyed in the book's 149 pages. Everything but the Blue Grotto was there. I was particularly delighted to see a photo of the villa that figured so largely in one of my favorite films, Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT (1963): it was built by the Fascist -- later Communist -- writer Curzio Malaparte.<br />Many of my favorite books point the way to interesting new authors, works, and places. GREENE ON CAPRI is a keeper, and I expect it will help inform my future reading and (hopefully) travel for some time to come. Shirley Hazzard is a delightful writer, and Greene a fascinating if prickly subject. The result: a  literary gem which merits my highest recommendation.	2003-01-31

This was at a time that the ONLY acceptable reading material was Mao's Little Red Book and other suchlike politico-economic tracts.<br />To understand why I love this book, you have to understand that I went to France primarily to see Honore de Balzac's house on the rue Raynouard and his tomb at the Pere Lachaise cemetery -- both in Paris. When I first read OLD GORIOT years ago, I felt as if my eyes were opened for this first time. LOST ILLUSIONS, COUSIN BETTE, URSULE MIROUET and the others merely reinforced this love.<br />Likewise, it was the Waverley Novels of Sir Walter Scott that impelled me to first go to Scotland, and to keep returning. And it was the NJALS SAGA and GRETTIR'S SAGA that took me to Iceland in 2001.<br />The point I am trying to make is that the great stories are capable of enriching your life and casting away your blinders more effectively than anything else I can imagine. Balzac, Bronte, Cervantes, Hugo, Stendhal, Dickens, Tolstoy -- these are names to conjure with. I can think of no better way to bring enchantment and meaning to life than a course of the classics, undertaken with the same sense of awe and wonderment as the narrator, his friend Luo, and the little Chinese seamstress felt in their mountain fastness. Try it sometime.<br />The only comparison I can think of is Ray Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451, and -- even more -- Francois Truffaut's film of the same name, with its long tracks and pans across the covers of scores of Truffaut's favorite books as if it were us looking for the last time upon something that was loved, but about to be destroyed forever. Sadly, it's not unimaginable that a day will dawn on which, only in remote areas far from the nightmarish cities, will people of the future will look with wild surmise on the few literary treasures they can find in the dustbin of our civilization.<br />Read Dai Sijie, and then read Balzac.

Eric Schlosser goes well beyond the mere truism that \\"it isn't good for you\\" and looks at how the whole fast food industry has changed the way we live, from farmers to urban development, from immigration to globalization, from obesity to mad cow disease, and from entrepreneurship to the most god-awful working conditions this side of Dickens's London.<br />FAST FOOD NATION is not just about fast food: It is about the CULTURE of fast food, and how that could be ever so much more pervasive than the e-Coli and rat feces in your Quickie Burger. In its own way, it is every bit as much a landmark as Upton Sinclair's THE JUNGLE.<br />The fact that Schlosser provides 70 pages of notes and a bibliography indicates that this is a serious book that invites contradiction. Only, I think I won't contradict it much: I will just continue to keep on walking right past those Golden Arches.<br />Curiously, Schlosser concentrates his attacks on the burger chains, leaving pizzerias, coffee shops, and sandwich chains pretty much off the hook. There are cases to be made for health issues relating to Chinese food, sushi, and other popular foods -- but I guess we'll have to wait for another book.	2003-01-23

This one manages to, just barely. The first half is a raunchy romp with a Havana prostitute named Alicia, who manages to fall off her bicycle in an interesting way, and who strives to \\"trade up\\" toward a higher class of client. When she tangles with a shady international entrepreneur named Victor King, she finds her match until ...<br />Well, I shouldn't say what happens midway through the book, if only because it is so surprising and outlandish that it should be experienced without any lead-in. Suffice it to say that, quite suddenly, one finds oneself in a standard crime caper novel of the shaggy dog variety. The author's style metamorphoses into another genre, and the lovely Alicia is relegated to a subordinate role.<br />Only the ironic ending keeps me from downgrading the book to three stars. Daniel Chavarria obviously has talent as a writer, and has some of the juiciest sex scenes in recent literature, but he is no master of the genre. Paco Taibo, whose praise appears on the back, stands head and shoulders above him with his Hector Belascoaran Shayne novels. Yet I suspect that Chavarria is still young and has room to grow, and I look forward to reading his other works.	2003-01-22

Sultan Murat III rules an empire that stretches from the Danube to the Nile, from the Barbary Coast of Algeria to the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates. As a patron of the arts, the Sultan commissions an illuminated manuscript that comes close to violating the Koran's ban on the depiction of living creatures.<br />At the Last Judgment, those who have depicted men and animals will be required by Allah to bring them to life. As they cannot but fail to usurp this function of the Creator, they are cast into hell for their mimicry of His divine powers.<br />The tight world of those few artists who are executing the Sultan's commission glance fearfully over their shoulders as a fundamentalist cleric, the Nusret Hoja of Erzurum, mounts an increasingly violent campaign against the \\"blasphemers\\" and \\"heretics.\\" When the body of Elegant Effendi, the well-known gilder of manuscripts is found dead in a well, the artists decide to take action.<br />It is the second death, that of Enishte Effendi, that finally results in action. The miniaturist (as these artists are referred to throughout the book) known as Black is enlisted by Enishte's daughter Shekure to find the killer. Black had loved Shekure for many years unrequited, but with Enishte gone, Shekure promises to marry him if he succeeds.<br />In his novel THE BLACK BOOK, the author writes: \\"... the only way to be one's self is by becoming another or by losing one's way in another's tales.\\" Orhan Pamuk in this novel tells his story through the mouths of twenty narrators, ranging from the main characters to the corpse of Elegant Effendi, the color red, a dog, a horse, Satan, Death, a tree, an unnamed woman, and so on. Where this technique could be expected to fragment the tale so that it becomes difficult to follow, here it succeeds brilliantly. The story passes from one narrator to the other almost seamlessly, and the trail is never lost.<br />One result of this technique is an incredible feeling of density and richness. Sixteenth century Istanbul is depicted here from its beggars to its coffee shops and wandering clothing merchants. From the Sultan's palace to an eerie abandoned dervish lodge, we see the gamut of Turkish society at the height of its power -- and at a point where it was beginning to be influenced by its old enemy, Christendom.<br />In the afterlife, Enishte hazards to ask Allah a question:<br />\\"Over the last twenty years of my life, I've been influenced by the infidel illustrations that I saw in Venice.

(He was supposedly 17 when he died.)<br />Will literary \\"resurrectionist\\" Harriet Scrope succeed in taking Wychwood's work on Chatterton and passing it off as her own, just as Stewart Merk merrily signed the dead painter Seymour's name to his own work?<br />Why am I asking so many questions?<br />Because there are no answers.

In MAN CRAZY, she examines what it took to be a female camp follower of someone like Charles Manson (here named Enoch Skaggs and relocated to Upstate New York).<br />Ingrid Boone grows up the daughter of a former aviator on the run and a good-time girl named Chloe who supplements her earnings by accepting money from well-off men who are \\"separated\\" from their wives. Even before the onset of puberty, Ingrid feels she must win approbation by offering sexual favors to the boys in her school. It is only a small step from there to becoming \\"Dog-Girl\\" for the sadistic Skaggs and his gang.<br />The scenes with Skaggs's gang take a strong stomach to read through, as a \\"traitor\\" named Gem is put to death by Enoch and as Ingrid is passed around from man to man and \\"punished\\" by being thrown naked into a cellar overflowing with rubbish and feces. There is enough will to live (but only just) for her to escape and find help after having been locked in there for days.<br />Oates is brilliant at showing us what horrors can lie behind the bland face of the pretty clerk who takes our applications or the receptionist who answers the phone and puts us on hold. The book ends with a now \\"rehabilitated\\" Ingrid looking at trees felled by a storm:<br />\\"They were alive, only not vertical.

Barbara Grizzuti Harrison is very conversant with the best travel literature of the past (and thoughtfully provides us a useful bibliography) and -- more rare by far -- has a great deal to add as an Italian-American confronting the land of her birth.<br />After her chapter on Naples and Campania, the book takes an entirely different tack. The author goes to visit what remains of her family in rural Molise and Calabria. Big mistake. You can't mix pleasure with unfinished family business and expect to get anything other than heartsick.<br />I remember taking a visit to Hungary and Slovakia to visit my relatives some years ago. Their reaction: Why haven't you visited us before? Why aren't you staying longer? When are you coming back? Let us introduce you to your third and fourth cousins! It was interesting, at times even exhilarating, but it was no vacation. And you need a vacation from your vacation when you return.<br />Although Harrison's family visits break her book in two, it conveys a sense of truth missing from most books of the sort -- especially of the nefarious Tuscan villa genre. Our ancestors left their homes for a reason. They may not tell you the reason; but those left behind nursing their grudges will gladly set you straight -- possibly to your intense discomfiture.<br />So in the end, I have nothing but praise for this book. Especially if you are an Italian-American going back to the &quot;Old Country&quot; for a first visit, you must read this book. Like the author, take your vacation first -- then go face the music with your relatives.	2002-11-30

Stay in grim hotels with broken toilets and damp, furrowed beds. No, the management will not give a damn for your comfort. And don't bother hailing a policeman: He will shake you down for cigarette money, ask why you are there, and put you through a bureaucratic nightmare grilling. Except for Turkey and Israel, the countries which Kaplan visits are run by mafias, megalomaniac dictators in the Saddam Hussein mold, or ex secret policemen (hint: these are the best run).<br />We are so simplistic because of our Eurocentrism: Our textbooks ignore 80% of the globe. Ask your children where Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan are located and who their neighbors are. Better book up, kiddies, or you may be hauling RPGs and messkits there in defense of tomorrow's oil.<br />The common element in all these countries is that they are places were ethnicity is complex. Look for more ethnic cleansing on a scale which makes the former Yugoslavia look like a church social. Give these people democracy? Don't forget that Slobodan Milosevich was, after all, a democratically-elected leader, and look what he did! Democracy CAN be a license to kill your neighbor.<br />Kaplan's greatest value is to educate his readers on the dangers of simplistic solutions. Read him, and you will no longer reel with sucker punches as different parts of the world emerge from nowhere to suddenly become angry crisis zones demanding our immediate attention. \\"Self-interest at its healthiest,\\" writes Kaplan, \\"implicity recognizes the self-interest of others, and therein lies the possibility of compromise.

Popular thugs like Lucius Sergius Catilina (Catiline) and Publius Clodius Pulcher saw in the shifting vacuums of power an opportunity to flout the law and win power and riches at the expense of their fellow countrymen. Standing squarely in their path was a Roman Senator, Marcus Tullius Cicero, who knew how to win men's minds with his powerful speeches and who had a fanatical dedication to maintaining the rule of law in the face of anarchy.<br />The art that Cicero practiced is not held in great repute today: We tend to distrust a man who can marshal cogent arguments and dazzling rhetoric in support of a cause. Consider, however, how remarkable it is that so many of Cicero's orations, letters, and other writings have survived today. Not only were his speeches eagerly read by his contemporaries, but early Christian monks saw in the great orator a basically moral, even if Pagan, writer whose work was worth saving in the scriptorium.<br />Among his own speeches, Cicero most highly rated his four blistering attacks on Catilina. My own personal favorite is \\"In Defence of Titus Annius Milo.\\" In it, the wily orator shows he had a strong streak of Johnny Cochrane. The Tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher had been one of Cicero's most determined enemies and at one time had him banished for his advocacy of executing the leaders of Catiline's conspiracy. When Clodius is killed attempting to bushwhack a rival, Cicero jumped to defend the accused murderer.<br />In a letter, Cicero had bragged, \\"Let me tell you that it was I who produced the necessary darkness in the court to prevent your guilt from being visible to everyone.\\" Where Cicero claims that Titus Annius Milo was attended at the time of the ambush with an \\"unwarlike retinue of maids and pages,\\" he was actually accompanied by a large party of gladiators who were more than able to thwart the attack. While claiming that Milo had never threatened Clodius, Cicero wrote a letter to his lifelong correspondent Atticus stating the opposite, that Milo had openly threatened to kill Clodius.<br />Even when pulling the wool over his listeners' eyes, Cicero's political speeches in this volume provide a fascinating picture of a time and place which would otherwise be largely unknown to us.ote a letter to his lifelong correspondent Atticus stating the opposite, that Milo had openly threatened to kill Clodius.<br />Even when pulling the wool over his listeners' eyes, Cicero's political speeches in this volume provide a fascinating picture of a time and place which would otherwise be largely unknown to us.	2002-10-31

I was also conscious that Furst did a creditable job bringing to life a time and place we all knew mostly from the movies. Of course, a film adaptation of this novel would probably garner an R-rating, what with its hero's richly textured sex life.<br />Jean Casson plays a small-time movie producer who has to learn how to shift for himself under the Nazi occupation of France. On the way, he not only falls in love with the hot starlet Citrine, but simultaneously acts as an agent for the Boche and the Resistance.<br />Furst's Gestapo officers come across as unexpectedly tolerant and even bemused -- except when they are crossed. Ach, these French! Why can't they understand that we are only trying to help them? Lieutenant Colonel Guske of the SS in particular is sketched in with admirable restraint.<br />My only problem with an otherwise wildly entertaining read is that Casson's escape from Gestapo headquarters at the end is just a bit too pat. With his strength at setting the mood and his aptitude for interesting and very French characterizations, Furst could have sacrificed some of the derring-do at the end without sacrificing the sense of the story.<br />I first heard of the author on a National Public Radio broadcast while driving to the library. Within hours, I was congratulating myself for having found another interesting new writer.	2002-10-18

In their volcanic fastnesses, the Icelanders not only told and retold the famous Sagas of Icelanders, but also sagas of kings, warriors, and saints -- even when they had little or nothing to do with Iceland. As the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus wrote around 1200, Icelanders &quot;take great pleasure in discovering and commemmorating the achievements of all nations; in their view, it is as enlightening to discourse on the prowess of others as to display their own.&quot;<br />Fortunately, this book is translated and edited by Professor Jesse L Byock of UCLA, whose VIKING AGE ICELAND is a model introduction to the subject of the Icelandic saga. In addition to providing an excellent translation, Byock's introduction is both thorough and enlightening; and, typical of his work, there are illustrative maps, drawings, genealogies, notes, charts and tables, and a useful glossary of characters.<br />If you've read BEOWULF, why bother cracking Kraki? For one thing, the Icelanders are great story-tellers, and the saga is a great read. I found it interesting that while the saga was written some 350 years into the Christian era, it is every bit as pagan as the Anglo-Saxon story. Odin appears in disguise twice in the story, with nary a bishop or saint in the offing. (Only a few oblique references toward the end point to some inkling of Christianity.) It has long been my contention that Christianity sat ever so lightly on the mailed shoulders of the Icelanders. The grim gods of the Asatru never quite disappeared. In fact, it would not be surprising if the SAGA OF KING HROLF KRAKI were written by Christian monks at Skalholt or Holar or some other monastic community.<br />Picture the long dark Arctic winter nights in those scattered sod huts with their grass roofs. There was nothing like good food and drink punctuated with a story of great warriors and the supernatural to make the time pass quickly. Funny thing, it still reads well today.e pass quickly.

First and foremost, it is an autobiography of a great physician and animal lover who just happened to spend some years of his life on Capri.<br />Autobiographies can make for strange reading, especially when there are obvious omissions. Although Axel Munthe frequently accuses himself of being a ladies' man, there is no mention of any love interest by name or even generic description. (That reminds me of film director Josef von Sternberg's FUN IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY, where we learn in passing that the author was married because of a cryptic mention in a subordinate clause 300 pages into the book.) Also missing is any mention of Munthe's childhood, although I understand there is at least one other autobiography written by him (MEMORIES AND VAGARIES), which I have not read.<br />There is, however, one section that does not appear in any autobiography that I have ever seen: An anticipation of Munthe's Last Judgment in Heaven following his death, with St. Peter, Moses, Athanasius, and St. Francis joining in the discussion.<br />STORY OF SAN MICHELE ranges from Paris to Lapland, Rome, Naples,  Calabria, and Capri. We see duels, medical cases of wealthy women with imaginary diseases, demonic housekeepers, quacks, midwives, prostitutes, victims of cholera and earthquakes, brigands, shamans, and even an alcoholic ape. Munthe is a magnificent raconteur, and his book is a joy to read and reread.	2002-09-20

Arthur Morrison's THE DORRINGTON DEED-BOX has been near the top of my want list for over twenty years -- ever since Hugh Greene selected two of the six stories in it for his RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES series. When a highly random check revealed that the book was in print and available for well under the four digits used booksellers were charging, I pounced immediately.<br />One of the most underrated British novelists of the last 150 years, Morrison has given us such literary classics as HOLE IN THE WALL, TALES OF MEAN STREETS (well before Raymond Chandler popularized the phrase), and CHILD OF THE JAGO. In addition, his several volumes of Martin Hewitt detective stories are almost on a par with Conan Doyle's.<br />What sets this volume apart is that its protagonist, Horace Dorrington, is a far bigger scoundrel than Frazier's Flashman. He attempts to have one client drowned in a tank and scruples not to commit extortion and highway robbery at the slightest opportunity. At one or two points, he is almost on the side of good, but vitiates his status by cutting side-deals with the villains. Why Morrison never published any more collections in this series is beyond me.<br />At a time when anti-heroes are more generally accepted, the DEED-BOX furnishes a pleasant combination of rampant immorality and genteel Victorian language.<br />Indeed, it is well worth scouring used bookshelves for the \\"other\\" detectives, such as Ernest Bramah's blind detective, Max Carrados; R. Austin Freeman's Dr. Thorndyke; and Baroness Orczy's delicious and never named Old Man in the Corner. Happy hunting!	2002-09-19

In both books, a man is inspired by a sexy, discontented married woman into murdering hubby for gain.<br />POSTMAN's drifter is now a cocky insurance salesman (Walter Huff) who thinks he can both beat the odds and get the girl (Phyllis Nirdlinger), and -- why not? -- her daughter Lola as well. If you know anything about Greek tragedy, you can bet that the hubris mechanism is ready to spring into action with jaws agape.<br />James M Cain writes a tight novella that can easily be consumed in a single sitting. It's just that you feel you've been watching cockroaches mate from a great height. Few of Cain's novels show the least sign of sentiment, let alone liking, towards their characters. Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder's script for the film is actually far superior because the character of Keyes is developed into a moral center around which the story unrolls. (It also helps that Cain's INDEMNITY has a really gonzo ending.)<br />Nonetheless, Cain is what he is -- and his stories are always worth reading.

I read Uncle Scrooge comics with their wonderful Carl Barks stories and drawings. (Living in Southern California, I still half believe that earthquakes are caused by contention between the subterranean Terries and Fermies.) The superheroes were there, too, and I distinctly remember Classic Comic Books such as \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" and even novelty 3-D comic books that came with glasses, such as those featuring the Three Stooges.<br />KAVALIER & KLAY dredged up my own boyhood, and that world of superhero flummery that I took so seriously. When my neighbor's house was trashed in a break-in, I remember creating innumerable scenarios featuring me in colorful skintight pajamas saving their cute daughter Patricia, who would thank me in unthinkable ways in those pre-pubescent times.<br />I don't know if Chabon's New York City ever really existed; but I would like to think it did. KAVALIER & KLAY comes complete with very realistic footnotes which are part of the fiction but convincing enough to make me think. If you are as intrigued by the book as I am, I refer you to the excellent bibliography at the end of the book, as well as the author's superb website.<br />You do not have to be an aficionado of comic books, magic, or Jewish history to like this book.

The information on Wilder's collaboration with the somewhat difficult Raymond Chandler is particularly well researched and well presented. Wilder is, after all, a writer's director, the way that John Ford is a director's director or Sergei Eisenstein, an editor's director. When film critic Andrew Sarris downgraded Wilder in his book THE AMERICAN CINEMA, it is because he could not understand that a director can be an artist while lacking a distinctive visual style. If Wilder's art comes out primarily during the scripting phase of the process, the resulting film can be just as successful -- especially if you have a great veteran like John B. Seitz behind the camera.<br />And there is no doubt that DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a masterpiece. It is a complex work bringing together Billy Wilder's bemused street smarts, James M. Cain's corrosive venom, and Raymond Chandler's poetic noir dialogue.<br />My only complaint with this monograph is that Schickel spent very little time on Cain's original novel except to pan it in passing. Granted that Chandler and Wilder improved on the original, the original is still one of the classic noir novels and deserves more than a passing nod.<br />Secondly, Schickel just mentions in passing an article on screenwriting written by Chandler and doesn't even bother footnoting it. I finally tracked down the article in the second volume of the outstanding Library of America set of Chandler's work (which, by the by, also includes the complete film script for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). Chandler was obviously very down on screenwriting. Like many writers, he assumed that the script was THE key element of the film, and that writers should be treated with greater deference. After reading it, I still think the world of Chandler, but I feel all the more respect for Wilder for how he handled his somewhat cranky associate.	2002-09-03

When his publisher protested, the author cut down the book to its<br />present length by eliminating verbs, articles, adjectives, and most other parts of speech. The result is a breathless gallop through a darkly fascinating world of murder, incest, perversion, corruption, greed, and lust. And that's just for starters!<br />Reading WHITE JAZZ is like reading Anthony Burgess's CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The language is a m&eacute;lange of English, LAPD crimestoppers' jargon, and 1950s pulptalk. Be prepared to deal with 187s, B&E, bootjacking, hinkiness, FIs, 459s, IAD, rebop, snarfing with soshes -- among other things.<br />What makes it all worthwhile is that Ellroy has a great story to tell, and he tells it well even if he invents his own language that only tangentially resembles English. Be prepared for harsh lights thrown into the darkest parts of the human soul. Be<br />prepared for almost universal corruption, varying only in degree. As you spiral into the depths with Ellroy, you can almost feel the walls converging and the floor dropping from under you.<br />This is a worthy conclusion to the author's Los Angeles Quartet. Be sure to read the novels in sequence for a sweeping panorama of 15 years of postwar degradation: THE BLACK DAHLIA, THE BIG NOWHERE, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, and -- not least of them -- WHITE JAZZ.	2002-09-02

That passion is missing from this book, which is an oddly muted tribute to a city I've always wished to visit. In addition, Jan Morris claims this will be her last book. Why should a good writer like her want to go out with such a whimper?<br />TRIESTE AND THE MEANING OF NOWHERE is, to be sure, a competently written work. All the major themes are present, but the guts just aren't there. What about Sir Richard F. Burton squirming through his last years far from the scenes of his triumphs? What about James Joyce creating great literature while trying to earn beer money teaching? Then there is the withering irony of Hungary's leader Admiral Horthy, at a time when his country had had no port for decades, yielding his country to the Nazis out of craven fear. There is material here for a book that yet remains to be written.<br />Trieste still sits there at the head of the Adriatic waiting for THE book to be written about it.

Now the majority population is Hispanic, and I frequently find myself communicating with them in Spanish.<br />Look in any newspaper. All around the world, large masses of people are on the move: Albanians to Italy, Serbs to Hungary, Rwandans to Zaire, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to Britain, Algerians to France, and so on. Every year, the number of people in refugee camps grows; and the resources of nations are stretched to the limit to accommodate the influx.<br />In America, we've had our own migrations: from the original 13 Colonies to the West, Blacks from the South to Northern industrial cities after World War II, and the Okies to California during the Depression.<br />My point is that Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH discusses a very contemporary phenomenon with compassion and great artistry. His Joad family can just as easily be Mexican \\"Wetbacks\\" looking or a better life in the same places where the Joads went (Arvin, the site of the FSA's Weedpatch Camp, is mostly Chicano today). How Steinbeck, a native Californian, came to side with the Okies against the corporate farmers and their hired deputies, and the townsfolk who supported them, is an interesting story in itself. Suffice it to say that no one was more sympathetic with the plight of the poor than Steinbeck, who at times comes across as an American Gorky.<br />There are other books that show equally great compassion. Steinbeck in this novel, however, rises to heights of poetry he was never to reach again. Tom Joad in this passage explains why he decided to become a labor organizer:<br />\\"Says one time he [Jim Casy, the preacher] went out into the wilderness to find his own soul, an' he foun' he jus' got a little piece of a great big soul.

Beginning in 1934, a young man in his twenties spends \\"three exquisitely happy years\\" in a China at the edge of the abyss. Japan had already invaded Manchuria and made no secrets of its intentions of further conquest. The shaky Chinese Republic was ruled out of Nanking; and Peking was still full of memories of the old Dowager Empress, the last of her line.<br />The streets of Peking were full of Confucian scholars, aging palace eunuchs, adepts of Taoism and Buddhism, starving White Russian refugees, 14-year-old opium addicts, and gentle courtesans and flute girls. Blofeld threw himself headfirst into this world which was on the point of being snuffed out forever. Most memorable are the White Russian hermaphrodite Shura and the Rasputin-like Father Vassily; the decorous Buddhist scholar Dr Chang; Yang Taoshih, the Taoist sage, and his friend known only as the Peach Garden Hermit; the lovely courtesan Jade Flute; and the mysterious Pao, who elopes with a young girl intended for a Japanese colonel.<br />After Blofeld leaves for a trip to England, the Japanese finally invade. There are two bittersweet chapters at the end where Blofeld revisits the scenes of his youth after 1945. His fragile Peking of the 1930s is now poised between a growingly thuggish Kuomintang secret police and the great unknown of Mao Tse-tung's Eighth Route Army.<br />Blofeld's Dr Chang says it all: \\"Decay is inherent in all things, as Shakyamuni Buddha bade us always remember. Death swallows all that has been born; rebirth or re-creation follow in their turn, as spring follows winter. Things rise and wane in unceasing flux.\\"<br />CITY OF LINGERING SPLENDOUR is recommended to all sentient beings who were ever young once and are now faced with a confused welter of possibilities, none of which seem particularly appetizing.	2002-07-31

Lucius Valerius Quintius is basically a good man who is left to his own devices because his social peers could not care to help shoulder the burden of governing.<br />But suddenly, news is heard of a large group of Moors that have crossed the Mediterranean and are pillaging Lusitanian towns. In addition, a small group of Christians is playing havoc with the local citizenry, who suspect them of cannibalism or worse. Quintius fortifies the town and helps to foil a Moorish attack, but he finds the Christians to be a stickier problem.<br />To begin with, he is fascinated by Iunia Cantaber, a well-born widow who, as leader of the Christian community, has a lemming drive toward martyrdom. The crises lead to an energizing of the citizenry, who begin to push Quintius farther than he wants and leads to a trial, which has a surprising outcome -- that I will not divulge -- and the outcome is that Quintius is forced to take on the Christians. After the trial, he takes the hint and surrenders his office to retire to his villa.<br />Christianity has suffered a setback in Tarcisis, but the God who strolls in the cool of an evening bides His time. A good men has been befuddled -- but isn't that always what happens in the political arena?<br />Carvalho's novel falls under the heading of light fiction. It partakes of a gentle irony that wears well through its length. The translation is by the great Gregory Rabassa, whose renderings of Latin-American fiction by Jorge Amado and Gabriel Garcia Marquez have made his name a standard of quality.	2002-07-26

Forget the mechanical wonders of Monticello. Forget the powdered wigs and the wooden teeth and the stately poses. This is the beginning of American history as it really was -- and apparently not all those truths were quite so self-evident in the end.<br />Joseph Ellis' FOUNDING BROTHERS is by far the best book I have read about the founding fathers (for a close second, see Gore Vidal's mischievous novel BURR). America's hard-fought liberty was no waltz, even after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown and even after the Articles of Confederation were replaced by the Constitution. Ellis shows that we just squeaked by, by the skin of our teeth.<br />The French Revolution, for example, shook our young country to the core. Some well-known leaders (like Jefferson) were all for supporting the French even if it meant fighting England again. Adams' Alien and Sedition Acts, the XYZ Affair with its (surprisingly contemporary) undertones of bribery and scandal, and England's unwillingness to see us as a separate nation -- all made the approach of the 1800 election a make-or-break affair for the young nation.<br />Then there was slavery. As early as 1790, abolitionists almost precipitated the immediate secession of South Carolina and Georgia. The only way the fracas was delayed was that Congress agreed to disagree and not do anything about it until the Missouri Compromise of 1820. In the meantime, the United States had grown stronger and was less likely to split apart at the seams.<br />Despite the history textbooks, Thomas Jefferson does not emerge as one of the good guys of our early years. He had an ability to speak out of both sides of his mouth and flood the media with spin that would make his fortune in today's DC scene. His attacks on John Adams while professing friendship are a model for contemporary sleazebag politicians. (There is a fascinating coda: After Jefferson left the presidency in 1809, he and Adams picked up their friendship where it left off -- and both men died within 5 hours of each other on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence!)<br />Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, who for some reason are at the beginning of the book, were both sleazebags of a sort. If Burr hadn't shot him in a duel, Hamilton's reputation may well have taken a dive on the basis of his shady maneuverings. And by winning the duel, Burr paradoxically was the big loser. It is not Burr's picture that appears on the $10.00 bill.<br />Curiously, George Washington comes off the best of the founding fathers. Although he was not the world's greatest military leader, there was a universal feeling that if there should be a first president of the United States, it would have to be either George or no one.

If Burr hadn't shot him in a duel, Hamilton's reputation may well have taken a dive on the basis of his shady maneuverings. And by winning the duel, Burr paradoxically was the big loser. It is not Burr's picture that appears on the $10.00 bill.<br />Curiously, George Washington comes off the best of the founding fathers. Although he was not the world's greatest military leader, there was a universal feeling that if there should be a first president of the United States, it would have to be either George or no one.

Since the Emperor regarded himself as the poet par excellence, everyone else was ultimately disposable. Both Petronius and Seneca were ultimately requested to commit suicide and did so, lest the Praetorian Guard were called in to \\"assist\\" them.<br />In the earlier days of Nero's rule, when there was some possibility that his would be one of the rare enlightened reigns, Petronius and Seneca joined Nero in a regular after-dinner literary society where the humor was frequently raunchy and the sex more often than not perverted.<br />The SATYRICON was originally a fairly long episodic spoof of the ODYSSEY: its hero offends the God Priapus by ransacking his temple and is stricken with impotence. He and his friends and bedmates wander through Italy recounting their adventures. The only fairly intact sequence tells of a dinner by a nouveau-riche merchant named Trimalchio who holds an elegant banquet but whose base-born origins are always showing. All the rest of the episodes are fragmentary, though not without interest.<br />Seneca takes the recently poisoned Emperor Claudius down a peg by spoofing his deification. Starting with Julius Caesar, the Romans turned many of their leaders into gods upon their demise. Claudius -- who was by no means the nice guy portrayed in the Robert Graves books -- gets short shrift in the underworld. A clue: The title is usually translated as \\"The Pumpkinification of Claudius.\\" Seneca was treading carefully here, as Nero's mother was Claudius' wife and is generally considered to have been the one who poisoned him.<br />These are not works that you can sit down and read as if they were novels. The introductions are not only helpful, but mandatory to understanding what follows. Both works, along with the works of Lucan, are essential to understanding this darkly fascinating period of Roman history.	2002-07-17

The real action takes place inside the minds of the characters. If you're looking for all the external trappings of interplanetary Sci-Fi, you will be deeply disappointed. Approach it with an open mind, and you will be richly rewarded.<br />What happens when one of the most powerful men on the planet Mars finds that real-estate speculators are intent on gobbling up the remote and seemingly worthless Franklin D Roosevelt mountains? Naturally he wants to find out why. A casual conversation with a psychologist followed by a chance encounter with a master repairman leads to one of those Dickian leaps: Since (1) autistic children do not respond to others because they are living in the future, (2) just build a machine to slow down time and (3) maybe even use it to go back in time and retroactively post a claim on the land before the speculators do.<br />Well, the mechanism works, in a way. The speculators were proposing to build giant apartment blocks to help relieve overcrowding on polluted Earth. The autistic boy, Manfred Steiner, sees much further, however, to the time the apartment block would become a warehouse for the sick and dying, a \\"tomb world,\\" of which he himself is a denizen. Manfred's visions have a way of bending the reality of those around him; he persistently retreats to a vision of reality as \\"gubble\\" -- entropy seen as large wormlike constructs that underlie reality, leading to pure \\"gubbish.\\"<br />MARTIAN TIME-SLIP is one of my favorite Philip K Dicks. (The problem is that I like all 15 or so I've read more or less equally.) Reading Philip K Dick tends to bend your sense of reality much as Manfred Steiner does. And one can't help looking over one's shoulder for a few hours after reading him.<br />I see Dick as not so much a science fiction writer as a creator of disturbing and eerily plausible futures.tures.	2002-07-01

And when we do, we underestimate it. It's all so 18th century and so, so not now.<br />McEwan spins a short, simple tale of two men who once vied for the same woman's favors coming together at her funeral and vowing eternal friendship ... and a few other things which I can't divulge. It's pretty hard to identify with the two gentlemen -- one the editor of a newspaper and the other a renowned composer. The first bets the farm on publishing some compromising photographs of an up-and-coming Tory politician (who also was one of the late lady's lovers); the other watches a serial rapist at work in the Lake District and continues composing his symphony rather than risk involvement. The two friends take umbrage at each other and their friendship turns to bitter antipathy.<br />The ending is as neat and symmetrical as Mozart's MARRIAGE OF FIGARO or COSI FAN TUTTI. <br />If I need to wear a powdered wig to enjoy such entertainment, let it be so! McEwan has a wicked sense of humor and a deft touch with this little entertainment. (And it was a nice diversion after reading 730 pages of Proust.)<br />Let the petards be hoisted and the games begin!	2002-06-26

His plan to ingratiate himself with Gilberte by becoming friends with her parents backfires badly when Gilberte begins to distance himself from him. He agrees then to spend a season with his grandmother in a Norman oceanside resort named Balbec. There, in the most memorable scene in the novel, he makes the acquaintance of a &quot;little band&quot; of eight girls whose poise and sang-froid disarranges his senses. He falls in love, with first, then another. As the novel ends, we see him select one of them, Albertine, for future conquest.<br />This is my second time through the budding grove of Proust's great multi-part novel with its crescendo of (unfulfilled) sensuality. Such was the impact of the Balbec scenes that I thought that the narrator's pursuit of the band of girls took up most of the novel. In fact, it does not appear until well into the last part and takes up less than 200 pages. It is simply that Proust imprinted that scene so strongly in my mind that, over the years, I mistook a part for the whole.<br />WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE introduces some memorable characters that will come back in future volumes: In addition to Albertine, there are Robert de Saint-Loup, the painter Elstir, the Marquise de Villeparisis, and the Baron de Charlus. In the later volumes, we will see how Marcel (for that is the narrator's name) will fare with Albertine, and how the world that he saw as a shimmering fairy castle will shatter with the working out of his destiny, that of his friends, and that of the French in the years before the Great War.<br />One of the great chess grandmasters commented on the opening setup position -- before any moves had been made -- by saying &quot;All the mistakes are there, waiting to be made.&quot;eat War.<br />One of the great chess grandmasters commented on the opening setup position -- before any moves had been made -- by saying &quot;All the mistakes are there, waiting to be made.&quot;	2002-06-24

Lawrence, Charles Dickens, Tobias Smollett, and now Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. I had no great expectations but was knocked for a loop from page one.<br />Never before had I encountered a questing mind quite like Goethe's. Almost from the moment to left Carlsbad in September 1786, he was noticing the geological structures underlying the land and the flora and fauna above it. He sits down and talks with ordinary people without an attitude -- and this after he had turned the heads of half of Europe with his SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER. Here he was journeying incognito, apparently knowing the language well enough to communicate with peasants, prelates, and nobility.<br />One who abhors marking books I intend to keep, I found myself underlining frequently. &quot;In this place,&quot; he writes from Rome, &quot;whoever looks seriously about him and has eyes to see is bound to become a stronger character.&quot; In fact, Goethe spent over a year in Rome learning art, music, science, and even sufferings the pangs of love with a young woman from Milan.<br />Bracketing his stay in Rome is a longish journey to Naples and Sicily, where he becomes acquainted with Sir Warren Hamilton and his consort Emma, the fascinating Princess Ravaschieri di Satriano, and other German travelers. One of them, Wilhelm Tischbein, painted a wonderful portrait of Goethe the traveller shown on the cover of the Penguin edition.<br />The translation of W.H. Auden and Elizabeth Mayer is truly wonderful. My only negative comments are toward the Penguin editors who, out of some pennywise foolishness, have omitted translating the frequent Latin, Greek, and French quotes. I am particularly upset about the lack of a translation of the final quote from Ovid's &quot;Tristia.&quot; In every other respect, this book is a marvel and does not at all read like a work written some 215 years ago.

He's always on the go, seemingly preferring an enclosed carriage careening down the road to mixing it with the natives (he makes one exception for Genoa, where he spends twelve months). And he makes virtually no mention of his wife, to whom refers at one point as accompanying him, but who therupon disappears as surely as if she had fallen down a well. Finally, as a Roman Catholic, I would spend my trip grimacing at his observations of my faith.<br />The people appearing in PICTURES are almost entirely people encountered enroute, including postilions, innkeepers, guides, soldiers, and the like. He does not appear to have entertained any intention of interviewing writers, political leaders, prelates, or others. It is as if I took a trip through the U.S. and wrote only about bus drivers, service station attendants, traffic cops, and ticket takers.<br />And yet, and yet, it is obviously the great Charles Dickens writing this book. The writing is superb even if the subject matter is strangely limited. I was entertained, dismayed, and befuddled all at the same time. Comparing it to something like Mark Twain's INNOCENTS ABROAD or ROUGHING IT, however, I feel it is Twain who comes out ahead. Dickens, it seems, forgot to create any memorable characters.	2002-05-08

Somewhere in Southern Italy, Maria, a young daughter of a Norman robber baron marries Richard d'Alene, an unprepossessing but ambitious young knight. Secretly, she prefers his more handsome younger brother Roger, but accepts her lot. Little by little, Richard increases his hold over the area by a combination of successful warfare and enlightened leadership. Maria gradually begins to share some of his power in Robert's absence and becomes indispensible to him. Finally, having defeated the local Saracens on the coast and his traitor brother Roger, Richard becomes a king and Maria his queen.<br />As a history buff, I picked up my copy of John Julius Norwich's huge THE NORMAN CONQUEST OF ITALY and scanned the index for place names such as Iste, Agato, Mana'a (or Marna), and Castelmaria -- only to find that Ms. Holland invented them. As for Richard and Maria and Roger d'Alene, there was not a mention.<br />Without being beholden to actual historical characters or locales, Holland gives you an excellent feeling for Medieval Italy. Richard and Maria are a contentious yet loving couple (though Richard sometimes comes across very like Charlotte Brontë's Rochester in JANE EYRE). Maria herself is a complete creation, totally grounded, yet as bold in her way as any of the Norman knights.<br />This is a superb book and highly recommended to all.	2002-05-06

Whether or not the author selected it himself or it was tagged on at the publisher's request, the title should tell you that this is NOT a serious scholarly work. At the same time, it is apparent that Anthony Blond knows his subject matter well: He just wanted to have some fun. I picked up this book to read for fun and actually learned quite a bit I didn't already know from Michael Grant, Tacitus, or Suetonius.<br />The first chapter is about sex. That's another giveaway for the Hengist & Horsa crowd (q.v. Lewis Carroll) that tried to savage this book in their reviews. And it covers only the most interesting emperors. Oh, I suppose he could have gone on with chapters on Galba, Otho, and Vitellius -- but, after all, they didn't last long enough to make an impression, did they?<br />This is a good starting point for someone who wants a quick survey of the subject without getting lost in the footnotes. Blond mentions some interesting secondary sources along the way, and has even interested me in seeking out Josephus, Martial and Juvenal. His send-up of Cicero as a corrupt slumlord was a new one on me: I guess I better read some of those letters to Atticus.<br />You don't have to be dull to write about Roman history. Anthony Blond does a creditable job here and makes me want to read more of his work.	2002-05-02

In addition, THE BOURBONS OF NAPLES was written by a descendent of one of the major players, Sir John Acton, and of that Lord Acton who said \\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" This work was therefore also an exercise in family history for Harold Acton.<br />When you conjure up a picture of Naples in the 18th century, what comes to mind is the Grand Tour -- that endless stream of well-to-do English and other Europeans (including Goethe) who considered their upbringing incomplete until they had seen the classical art treasures of Italy, wondered at the magnificence of Vesuvius, and tasted of the fleshpots of Naples. There, they partied with complaisant British consul Sir William Hamilton and his delectable wife Emma (later associated with Horatio Nelson).<br />The time period covered by the book encompasses the reigns of Charles III and Ferdinand I (or III or IV, depending on whether you are referring to him as King of the Two Sicilies, Sicily, or Naples). Ferdinand was married to Maria Carolina, daughter of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, sister of Marie Antoinette and grandmother of Napoleon's second wife Marie-Louise. While something of a grand scale manipulator, Maria Carolina pretty much ran the kingdom (into the ground) while Ferdinand spent his time hunting wild boar with cronies. Yet, thanks to the British fleet and Austrian army, she managed to hold on to her throne and write agonized letters to every crowned head in Europe until she proved too much for one British emissary, who packed her away to Vienna with her husband's permission.<br />The vicissitudes of the Bourbon monarchy in Italy make for fascinating reading. It had twice as many lives as a cat and even managed to survive the threats posed by the French Revolution and Napoleon -- but just barely.	2002-04-25

But was it really? There definitely remains a hard core of hardcore Sicilian-ness that finds its perfect expression in the mafia with all its traditions of silence, corruption, violence, and faithfulness onto death.<br />But how does one approach such a vast reserve of secrecy? Australian expatriate Peter Robb has hit upon a kind of double helix organizing principle that involves slowly rotating around its subject matter from several different points of view. In this helix are mixed food, history, culture, art, landscape, and all that is Sicily. We find Giuseppe di Lampedusa, Lucky Luciano, the painter Renato Guttuso, Michele Sindona, and the Vatican enmeshed in a kind of dance of death. But in the end, we are no closer to proof that arch-politician Giulio Andreotti sold his soul to Uncle Toto Riina of the Cosa Nostra.<br />Arriving at this proof is not Robb's goal. His spiralling book has taken it all in and fascinated us with stories of how the fork was invented, how di Lampedusa's talent was made known to the outside world, what happened to Palermo's Vucciria market, how Guttuso's friends were all kept from visiting the dying painter by a cabal of servants -- and perhaps by Andreotti?<br />This maddening book that goes nowhere and everywhere lacks only two things (for which I blame the publisher): maps and photographs. I kept getting lost, but I never lost interest. The lines of Eugenio Montale that form the book's epigraph describe it all:<br />History isn't<br />the devastating bulldozer they say it is.<br />It leaves underpasses, crypts, holes<br />and hiding places.	2002-03-31

That's also where you'll find David Goodis's characters: Wherever they begin, you will find they will plummet to the lowest depths like a sinker.<br />Alvin Darby is married to a beautiful brunette and works in an office making good money as an actuary, but there is a wild hair (literally) up his craw. He is drawn to a strange vision of a platinum blonde and can't quite figure why. Before he married, he ran around with one such blonde named Geraldine but found her too capricious. But his marriage starts to unravel as he suspects his wife of infidelity. Instead of confronting her, however, he loses himself in the platinum blonde dream and begins to frequent low bars and lower company.<br />Sigmund Freud would approve of how Alvin confronts his past -- pardon me, but I can't divulge the secret -- and begins the slow process of redemption.<br />Goodis is always worth reading, and this is one of his best, if not one of his better known. This British Serpent's Tail edition comes with a respectful if not exactly accurate introduction by Adrian Wootton, who seems to think the SATURDAY EVENING POST was a newspaper. I am grateful that Serpent's Tail published OF TENDER SIN and look forward to obtaining their other Goodis titles.	2002-03-29

Of all the great writers, only G K Chesterton can address this subject without appearing static and banal. At one point, one of his characters writes that \\"men flee from the embrace of a great optimist as from the embrace of a bear. Nothing brings down more curses than a real benediction.\\"<br />Over his lifetime, GKC has been the great optimist -- a great shambling bear who is at the same time a bringer of benedictions. His entire work is the most optimistic oeuvre ever penned. Whenever the shadows of the post-September 11 world weigh me down, I pick a book, any book, from the four shelves of Chesterton in my collection and surrender myself to hope, whimsy, and the promise of a better world.<br />MANALIVE is a novel in two movements. In the first, we are introduced to Innocent Smith, who alarmingly drops into the story from the sky as it were. His words and actions are so radical as to cause a conspiracy to be formed (mostly by two psychologists who are present) to have him placed in an institution.<br />Chesterton suddenly introduces one of his pet ideas. Why not have Smith's innocence (sic) judged by the residents of Beacon House, where the action takes place? Given a choice between large and small institutions, GKC always opts for the latter. One of the characters, Michael Moon, asserts:<br />\\"Come, we are a company of free, white, Christian people, such as might be besieged in a town or cast up on a desert island. Let us do this thing ourselves. Let us go into that house there and sit down and find out with our own eyes and ears whether this thing is true or not; whether this Smith is a man or a monster. If we can't do a little thing like that, what right have we to put crosses on ballot papers?\\"<br />In the second part, everything that seemed bizarre or immoral in Smith's behavior turns out to be the result of a series of misconceptions (a similar theme recurs in GKC's FOUR FAULTLESS FELONS). Far from being the quintessence of turpitude, Innocent Smith is shown by the evidence to be not only NOT guilty, but a very model of human behavior.<br />Perhaps the world of Chesterton's novels can be faulted for a lack of realism, but only if you think that realism implies grimness. This is a world where ideas exist vividly as personifications, and there is not a single distraction from the purity of that idea. If it is allegorical, it is a most robust and muscular allegory replete with banners flying and bands playing. And we are all invited to the party.GKC's FOUR FAULTLESS FELONS).

Having read Vidal's BURR, I could hardly wait to tackle the next volume in his American Chronicle series: LINCOLN. The only disappointment came in that, from the very start, I could see the assassination scene at Ford's Theater. There was no changing the fact that all roads ultimately led to that bullet in the head; and when it happened, there was nothing more to do than quickly wrap up the loose ends and that was it!<br />Such is the problem of most biographical novels, that they end in the death of their subject.<br />Vidal deflected the problem in BURR by having the main character the fictional Charlie Schuyler (who makes a cameo appearance in LINCOLN's last chapter). Although in LINCOLN, the author used multiple points of view, not any one of these point of view characters could carry the story by himself: John Hay, Secretary of State Seward, Secretary of the Treasury Chase, and Southern sympathizer David Herrold. The last of these is the weakest. Vidal fails to provide anyone who can give a good reason to stand up for the Confederacy (such as in that great scene in the movie GETTYSBURG where Col. Joshua Chamberlain's brother talks to the three rebel prisoners and why they fought). I guess it shows that Vidal is too much of a Yankee.<br />In the end, LINCOLN ends with the president's secretary, John Hay, in France. Perhaps more of the narrative burden should have been borne by Hay. He was certainly interesting and articulate enough, where Chase and Seward come across as eccentric and old-womanish with exaggerated opinions of themselves; and David Herold comes across as a wannabe punk.<br />The glory of LINCOLN is in its characterization of the President himself. Lincoln always surprises his enemies and always knows more than he lets on. Before long we learn of Mary Todd Lincoln's growing mental illness and marvel at Lincoln's gentle yet effective protection of his family from the scandals that threaten to engulf it.<br />All in all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Lincoln's presidency.

She had a serenely pleasant face that radiated calm and good sense, and suddenly I wanted to know more about her. When I discovered that her diaries and letters cut a broad swath from 1778 to 1838, I was hooked.<br />Here is a woman who was an intimate of Dr Johnson, James Boswell, Joshua Reynolds, the Thrales, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the Bluestockings, George III and Queen Charlotte -- to name just a few. She was the first woman novelist who did not die in penury (like Aphra Behn and Charlotte Lennox): Her EVELINA, CECILIA, CAMILLA, and THE WANDERER are still readily available after more than 200 years. For five years, Miss Burney served as wardrobe maid for Queen Charlotte until illness forced her to resign. Her descriptions of the court of George III show the monarch at the beginnings of the madness that later debilitated him and contain some of her best prose.<br />By then, the French Revolution was in full swing, and scores of French nobility made their way to safety in England. When she met General d'Arblay, adjutant to the exiled Marquis de Lafayette, it was love at first sight for this 40-year-old woman who had never been married. Despite the opposition of her father, Fanny married d'Arblay and lived happily with him until his death more than 20 years later. Sadly, she also outlived her son from this marriage.<br />Fanny followed her husband to France during the Consulate and met the rising young Napoleon, Talleyrand, Louis XVIII (during Napoleon's exile at Elba), and other notables. She succeeded in raising a family near Paris despite the fact that, for a good part of that time, France was at war with England. At Waterloo, she helped by helping to create bandages for the wounded.<br />This is a book to read slowly and savor the feeling of another time.

If one just looks at a summary of the story by itself, it's another typical women's novel about relationships. What makes it so much more is the fineness and fitness of Munro's perceptions about the way real people think, feel, and express themselves. On the second page, Rose's biological mother says that she feels as if there were \\"a boiled egg in my chest, with the shell left on.\\" She then proceeds to die of a blood clot on her lung. An image like that sticks in one's craw for many pages.<br />Later, Rose takes a train trip through heavy snow to Banff: \\"The train crept along slowly, fearful of avalanches. Rose ... liked the idea of their being shut up in this dark cubicle, under the rough train blankets, borne through such implacable landscape. She always felt that the progress of trains, however perilous, was safe and proper. She felt that planes, on the other hand, might at any moment be appalled by what they were doing, and sink through the air without a whisper of protest.\\"<br />As we see Rose grow up, get married, get divorced, try as a single mother to hook up with skittish males, and make her way through a middling, muddling life path, we experience a rising crescendo of minor epiphanies. Munro's language always gives dignity to moments of embarrassment, frustration, and minor-key elation.<br />After having second thoughts about her marriage to Patrick, she falls in love with him again as she sees the vulnerable nape of his neck as he, unknowing, studies in a library carrel. In the end, it turns out to be a bad move as Patrick gives up everything he held dear to become a carbon copy of his obnoxious suburbanite father. What saves the moment is that I can feel each such objective correlative deeply because I've made major decisions on equally shaky grounds.<br />Munro knows the language of the heart in all its minuteness and treats every step and misstep with the same respect and even love. She is a superb writer, and I eagerly look forward to reading her other works.the language of the heart in all its minuteness and treats every step and misstep with the same respect and even love.

The First Crusade was a victory for the West -- but it was all too short-lived. Then came Lepanto and the Siege of Malta, and crushing defeats at the hands of the Austrians and Hungarians. The tide was turned, and the Turks and their subject peoples were nonplussed.<br />Lewis shows that there have been two conflicting responses in the Muslim world to its reduced circumstances. The Turks by and large have attempted to understand the West, and at times were way off the mark. Lewis quotes one Turkish traveler as saying the Austrian emperor was polite and deferential toward ladies because of the Virgin Mary!<br />The other response is what we are encountering now: namely, Islamic fundamentalism. Many Muslims see their recent defeats as the result of insufficient attention to the old ways. The mullahs that taught the al-Qaeda terrorists emphasized study of the Koran and rejection of all Western elements in their society, except what was absolutely required to defeat the infidels.<br />In Islamic society, as Lewis points out, there is no secularism. All government, all trade, all interactions are dictated by the Koran. The only exception seems to be Turkey, which has benefited from the reforms of Kemal Ataturk. In his THE COMING ANARCHY, Robert Kaplan indicates that, alone among the Muslim nations, Turkey appears to be stable and viable enough to last out the coming storm.<br />This is a short book, but one that will make you stop and think. I also recommend that, if you like it, you look at some other of Lewis's work, including THE ARABS IN HISTORY.	2002-02-12

Where mainland European societies were all ruled either by large or petty despots or by the Church, Iceland was governed more or less by the consent of the governed. There was some slavery, and people on the edges of society fared no better (or worse) than anywhere else -- but your average Icelandic freeman and even women had some protection from the rich and powerful.<br />Until its submission to Norway in 1260, Iceland was a country without an executive, without an army, without a navy. Instead, grievances were addressed by seeking powerful allies whose self-interest in the issue could result in some gain for them. If a neighbor or even a chieftain encroached on your property, you could bribe another chieftain to become involved on your side. You may lose some property, but keep the most part intact for your heirs. (On the continent, your life AND property would both be forfeit.) Chieftains had no clearly defined territory, but only adherents -- and adherents could at any time align with competing chieftains at any time. Any disputes that showed signs of getting out of hand were ultimately resolved at the althing, an annual meeting of the chieftains and their adherents at Thingvellir in the southwest of Iceland.<br />Byock takes the sagas as his principal source and carefully shows how conflicts were resolved in such a way that life and property were protected. That is not to say that bloody, long-lasting feuds did not erupt -- but the damage was limited by the intercession of chieftains so that the feud would not divide society at large. As Njal Thorgeirsson says in NJALS SAGA: \\"With laws must our land be built, or with lawlessness laid waste.\\"<br />Some of the features of Icelandic society are difficult for us hieratic Europeans and Americans to comprehend. Byock provides detailed and lavishly illustrated examples to make his points clearly and convincingly. Indeed, in few historical works that I have ever seen has there been such superb illustrative maps and charts. Additional support is provided by comprehensive notes, bibliography, appendices, and index. This is at the same time a scholarly and an eminently readable work -- and by far the best study of Icelandic society to date.age was limited by the intercession of chieftains so that the feud would not divide society at large.

Everest Disaster	Books	5	3	5	N	N	At the Mercy of the Mountain	At 25,000 feet, you are only a fraction of yourself. Starved of oxygen, brain cells begin to die; and you struggle to perform the most simple tasks. Irrespective how strong your resolve, you are at the mercy of the mountain. Experienced professional climbers and sherpas both will suddenly lose bodily function and begin to die -- or not. They can just as easily \\"conquer\\" the peak and win glory. In either case, it's staking your life on a roll of the dice.<br />In the climbing season of 1996, a large number of climbing parties that included numerous non-professionals attempted Everest, and a dozen of them were left in crevasses, under avalanches, or under crude cairns put up by later expeditions. For several years, these expeditions were a source of controversy, fueled by a book attacking Krakauer and by a famous New Yorker article. People, being people, always want someone to blame.<br />I had heard of INTO THIN AIR long before I read it and knew of the controversies. Nothing prepared me, however, for Krakauer's vivid recounting of the events of 1996. Although it gets confusing cutting back and forth between 16 expeditions on the mountain, the central fact of the difficulties faced by the climbers and by the apparently random fates that befell them comes across clearly.<br />At one point, Krakauer quotes Conrad's LORD JIM:<br />\\"There are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales, and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a sinister violence of intention -- that indefinable something that forces it upon the mind and heart of a man, that this complication of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of malice, with a strength beyond control, with an unbridled cruelty that means to tear out of him his hope and fear, the pain of his fatigue and the longing for rest: which means to smash, to destroy, to annihilate all....\\"<br />So when I read all the morning-after pundits attempt to recast the events so that one person or another is to blame, all I can conclude is that anyone who attempts Everest has placed his life in pawn -- regardless how experienced he or she is, how strong, how well equipped, how otherwise lucky. Time and chance happen to all, and on the mountain, they happen with a vengeance.<br />This is superlative reading, and I recommend it to all without qualification.ne person or another is to blame, all I can conclude is that anyone who attempts Everest has placed his life in pawn -- regardless how experienced he or she is, how strong, how well equipped, how otherwise lucky.

After one play, one of them states, \\"Very well not played.\\" His partner chimes in, \\"Extremely well not played.\\"<br />So it is with A.S. Byatt's THE BIOGRAPHER'S TALE. A young scholar named Phineas G. Nanson tires of endless deconstructionism of literary works and is talked into writing a biography of Scholes Destry-Scholes, noted for his study of the redoubtable Elmer Bole. Nanson is tired of words: He wants things in his life. Destry-Scholes, however, turns out to be an elusive subject. He has left behind no portraits, only a few biographical fragments about Linnaeus, Francis Galton, and Hendrik Ibsen -- oh, and also a radiologist niece named Vera Alphage, whom Nanson beds. Enroute, he meets two gay adventure travel consultants, who hire him, and a voluptuous Swedish bee specialist named Fulla Bliefeld, who seduces him.<br />So what do we have here? One researcher. Two budding relationships. But no biography. I followed Byatt with great fascination down what appears to have been a garden path.<br />Normally, I would be outraged: I've been toyed with, but not actually traduced. For me, one measure of a book's success is where it leads me. Destry-Scholes' fragments have made me itch to read more about Linnaeus, Galton, and Ibsen. Aptly, the final image I have in my mind is the toilet-flushing image of the Maelstrom, the giant whirlpool off the coast of Norway where Destry-Scholes apparently lost his life.	2002-01-28

A young scholar named Phineas Nanson tires of endless deconstructionism and turns to writing a biography of a biographer, the redoubtable Scholes Destry-Scholes, noted for his study of the equally redoubtable Elmer Bole. Destry-Scholes, however, has covered his tracks well -- leaving behind no pictures, only some fragmentary writings on Linnaeus, Francis Galton, and Henrik Ibsen. Oh, and also a radiologist niece named Vera Alphage, whom Nanson beds. He also runs into Fulla Bliefeld, a Scandinavian scientist specializing in bees, who also finds a warm place in Nanson's heart.<br />Well, what do we have here? Let's see: Several fragments and two budding relationships. And the biography? Abandoned. Miss Byatt has aroused expectations which she has not fulfilled. Nanson's research is actually fascinating; and, until the very end, I wondered where Byatt was taking us. It seems the answer is, down a garden path.<br />If the rest of the book weren't so fascinating, I would be outraged. As it is, I'm still perpelexed by my first introduction to this writer, though I am interested enough to pursue some researches on my own into Linnaeus, Galton, Ibsen, and a certain whirlpool off the coast of Norway known as the Maelstrom. Consequently, I do not feel myself to have been completely traduced.	2002-01-28

So much of what has happened in Persia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in the last 150 years is due to what has been called \\"The Great Game.\\" Russia has always been a superpower that lacked a salt-water seaport free of ice all year round. (The Black Sea doesn't count because Turkey controls access to it through the easily defensible Bosphorus and Dardanelles.) Consequently, it has always sought to destabilize South Asia in the hopes of being able to get a port on the Indian Ocean.<br />One of the highest ranking pieces in the Great Game was the British intelligent agent Lieut-Col Frederick M. Bailey, who wrote this fascinating book. So if you're a great intelligence agent, why is it so difficult to write a good book? Simple: A good intelligence agent keeps too much unsaid. Information is his stock in trade, so he is very sparing of all the interesting details.<br />Picture present-day Uzbekistan in the first year of the Bolshevik takeover (1918). No one in Europe had any idea of what to expect from the Bolsheviks. Would they become more moderate in time? Would the Muslim population accept them? Would the White Russians defeat them in battle and restore the Czar?<br />In the midst of all these swirling theories strode the skinny and extremely canny Colonel Bailey. He set himself up in Tashkent as the official representative of His Majesty's Government but immediately ran into roadblocks. Without informing Bailey, Britain had in the meantime engaged the Bolsheviks in battle near Murmansk and near the Caucasus. That quickly made Bailey persona non grata (which meant ripe for execution in those times).<br />But how does one arrest a wizard? Bailey immediately went underground and assumed the identity of a Romanian, Czech, Austrian, Albanian, or other POW, of which Tashkent had many from those WW 1 days. He rarely stayed in one place for more than a day or two, though he did manage to develop some loyal contacts, including the US consul Tredwell. For over a year, Bailey eluded capture. During the whole of that time, there was no effective contact with his government; and during most of that time, he was actively sought by the Cheka, or secret police.<br />The escape from Tashkent was ingenious and dramatic. Bailey got himself hired as a Bolshevik agent under an assumed identity and assigned to Bokhara, which was not yet under Bolshevik control at that time. There, he reached into his inexhaustible supply of money and bought horses, men and influence to allow him to escape south to Meshed in Persia, where there was a British presence.<br />I wish I knew at every point how the magician pulled a particular rabbit out of his hat, but I'll just have to take that as a given. Today, Bailey is regarded by the British as one of their greatest spies. In Central Asia, he is regarded as an arch-villain who threatened the development of Communism in Central Asia.<br />MISSION TO TASHKENT is not an easy read, but it is absolutely vital in understanding the forces, many of which still operate in this pivotal area of the globe.d capture.

I remembered the glowing articles about Liberia (founded by American slaves); South Africa (loved that Reconciliation Commission); and Tito's Yugoslavia (they actually stood up to Stalin) that I read in years past. Each nurtured a hope that there was, in my lifetime, a way out for the world's oppressed.<br />There are, in fact, several ways out -- and none of them bode well for us wealthy democracies. The Malthusian pressures, according to Kaplan, will make the pot boil over with disease, unrest, mass migration, and terrorism. Why NOT become an exploding martyr when there is no reason to continue living? Why NOT contract smallpox and hop a jet to the States? Anything but stay on in a filthy gutter outside a shack cobbled together with garbage!<br />Kaplan doesn't have any answers. Washington doesn't have any answers. The U.N. has answers, but at a price tag that will put all of us on an economic par with Burkina Faso. And, of course, I don't have any answers; but I will continue to hope, because that is my nature.<br />I understand that Kaplan is becoming required reading in Washington. We must be careful, with all our power, not to become like Thucydides' Athenians: a great power who, in facing down the enemy, became perhaps worse than the enemy.<br />At the same time, it is a valuable corrective to read Kaplan. In addition to the essay &quot;The Coming Anarchy,&quot; I would particularly recommend the essays on Metternich and Kissinger, Gibbon's DECLINE AND FALL, and Joseph Conrad's NOSTROMO.<br />It all looked so rosy when the Berlin Wall fell. Now it's time to face the issues we ignored while engaged in our half-century folie de deux with Communism.	2002-01-18

I can think of only three others I have read in this genre that had any literary merit: Eliot's ADAM BEDE; Elizabeth Gaskell's CRANFORD; and Oliver Goldsmith's THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. I can see why SILAS MARNER is usually regarded as a novel to be read by the young, if only because it reinforces values that most of us see as desirable.<br />Granted that Marner starts out as a miser, if only because he is so isolated from the rural community in which he lives. When Marner's small fortune is stolen, a strange thing happens: His neighbors gather closer to him and help him, drawing him out of himself and illuminating the goodness that was always inside of him. Marner's neighbor, Dolly Winthrop -- a poor, inarticulate wheelwight's wife who does everything she can to make Silas a part of the village of Raveloe -- particularly shines through in an excellent supporting role, one of many in the book.<br />When a toddler whose mother dies crawls into Marner's house, the process begins to accelerate as he adopts her. The weaver now has someone to live for; and the love between him and the little Eppie begins to flower.<br />Good seems such undynamic a quality in literature. George Eliot is one of the few writers who can make the tribulations of a good person worthwhile reading. In weaver and his neighbors, Eliot has created an entire community that strives for the greatest good (with the sole exception of Dunsey Cass, who steals Marner's fortune). The best books always make you wonder what happens next; and SILAS MARNER kept me turning the pages, marvelling at my own reactions to what I would once have thought was too simple and flimsy to engage my attention.<br />George Eliot is a writer of many surprises and many surprising strengths. I had approached this book only because I was filling in a gap in my reading. Having read it, I urge anyone to pick up this book if you are young and hope for the best in life -- or come to it, like myself, an adult who has been &quot;nicked by the scythe,&quot; who has forgotten some simple truths about which he needed reminding.are young and hope for the best in life -- or come to it, like myself, an adult who has been &quot;nicked by the scythe,&quot; who has forgotten some simple truths about which he needed reminding.	2002-01-03

Just when the story seems to take on a Dame Christie neatness, it all comes unravelled at the little border town of Subotica. Musker, who had found in Myatt a potential sugar daddy, tries to invite the Doctor to a celebration, but is whisked away as an accomplice to Czinner. Myatt at first searches for Coral, but is drawn to Janet Pardoe's greater classiness. And Mabel Warren, who had left the train at Vienna, suddenly shows up in Subotica to claim Coral Musker for her own.<br />There are a few other characters, such as Josef Grunlich the Austrian thief; but my favorite is the purser at Ostend who cries out to Coral Musker, &quot;Remember me!&quot; even as he begins to forget her features.<br />We are not dealing with a deep work like Greene's later, more serious efforts. Instead of a Shakespearean tragedy, we have on our hands instead a tragicomedy like ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL or MEASURE FOR MEASURE. Dr Czinner is executed, and everybody else seems to change partners as if it were a game of Musical Chairs.<br />Graham Greene says it all when he quotes George Santayana in STAMBOUL TRAIN's epigraph: &quot;Everything in nature is lyrical in its ideal essence; tragic in its fate and comic in its existence.&quot;	2001-12-31

Similarly, Cortazar's stories are all constructed around a disturbing vision. In &quot;The End of the Game,&quot; for instance, three children don bizarre costumes and assume attitudes for the passengers on the trains that zip by them.<br />&quot;Blow-Up&quot; is very different from Antonioni's film. There is a menace in the interplay between the photographer, his unwitting subjects, and a third party who was watching both.<br />My favorite story in the collection is &quot;The Pursuer,&quot; a nakedly brilliant study of a black American Jazz musician and the critic who never quite understands the demons that give birth to the music. The story is dedicated to Ch. P., who I assume is Charley Parker. Cortazar's musician lives on the edge and is plagued by disturbing visions as he spirals down into a personal apocalypse. The critic, on the other hand, tries ineffectually to help the musician, but is more worried about what people will say about his latest study of the musician's work.<br />Cortazar's stories take place in a kind of half-European, half-Latin Neverland. Born in Belgium of Argentinian parents, he spent most of his life in Europe. It is as if the author's self-exile gave birth to a demon of restlessness that possessed his characters.<br />Although this is the first Cortazar I have read, it will not be the last.	2001-12-04

Every schoolboy knows that Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel; and many know that Thomas Jefferson accused him of a vast conspiracy to separate the new American West from the fledgling United States.<br />But did you know that, except for a minor skirmish at Trenton, George Washington never won a military battle (though he excelled in winning political conflicts)? Did you know that Washington, Hamilton, and Jefferson all died deep in debt? Finally, did you know that Martin Van Buren was probably Burr's illegitimate offspring? Through Burr's eyes, we see Thomas Jefferson as a bumbling would-be inventor who has dangerous tendencies toward absolutism, irrespective of his contributions to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.<br />This is a lot of material to cover, and Vidal does it well by creating a framing story consisting of the last three years of Burr's life, roughly 1835-37. The story is told by one Charlie Schuyler, a would-be writer, journalist, and lawyer who takes up with the Black Sheep of American History and works at writing his biography from papers loaned to him by Burr. We read these papers ourselves, interspersed through the current-day narrative.<br />Gore Vidal has that greatest of narrative gifts, of always being able to answer &quot;What happened next?&quot; to the satisfaction of his readers. He is comfortable with complicated skeins of narrative material and works it into a unified whole so that it almost reads as a history of the republic from 1776-1808, with a coda set some 30 years later in the waning days of Jackson's administration.<br />I have always shied away from reading about the birth of our country because I was put off by the haloes attached to our country's founders. Vidal knocks those haloes awry while yet exhibiting a sense of wonder that, somehow, it all worked out. I am reminded of D. H. Lawrence's STUDIES IN CLASSICAL AMERICAN LITERATURE -- another bad-boy attack on the good, grey early days of our republic.<br />You can still love your country knowing that George Washington used so much powder in his wig that he walked with a nimbus around his head and considerable fall-out on his shoulders.haloes awry while yet exhibiting a sense of wonder that, somehow, it all worked out.

From the Charles Addams cover to the engravings interspersed throughout the body of the text, I get a feeling of a book produced over half a century ago. A glance at the copyright page (which for some reason is on page 203 -- after the text) shows that large parts of the book were originally written in the 1940s.<br />Somehow, Bradbury linked them to a connecting story of a resurgent &quot;normal&quot; humanity threatening the vampires, werewolves, witches, and what-all residing in a strange Illinois farmhouse. And it all somehow works! It doesn't matter that the book contains elements that are dated across a wide spectrum of 55 years, which adds a poignant feel to the strangeness of the house's family members.<br />The book's subtitle is &quot;A Family Remembrance.&quot; Bradbury created another Addams family with real family values and with a real family's centrifugal and centripetal tendencies. In the end, it is one of Timothy's &quot;uncles&quot; who betrays the family, leading to its dispersal to the four winds.<br />Ever since I read FAHRENHEIT 451 and THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, I've felt that Ray Bradbury is one of our national treasures. There is a kind of sympathetic sadness, a loving kindness that permeates his work. Outer space is for him never far from the human soul, and vice versa. It has the effect of giving his work a universality that transcends genre writing.<br />I expect to return to FROM THE DUST RETURNED, most probably in October, the month that will be forever associated with Bradbury.	2001-11-20

Whichever side is right, what matters to me as a reader is that NIGHT is a profoundly moral work about surviving inhuman conditions, and that it is both powerful and superbly written.<br />I am reminded of two other great concentration camp works -- Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF IVAN DENISOVICH and Victor Frankl's MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING -- which it resembles. Where Wiesel differs is in his ability to depict Eliezer's central dilemma: whether to survive at all costs, or risk his own survival by giving aid to his father, who is less able to stand up to the torments of everyday life in the camps. There is a beautiful image of the prisoners' forced move from Buna to Gleiwicz when another son leaves his father in the lurch while Eliezer does his utmost to help his. When his father dies of dysentery shortly before liberation, the book comes to an end quickly because outside the memory of that moral struggle, there was nothing but undiscriminated pain.<br />Throughout this short book, the small acts of kindness come unexpectedly and stand out like so many diamonds in a vast mountain of pitch.<br />Life is full of moral choices, and we don't always make the right decisions. Wiesel brings home the point that trying to make the right choice is always important. Perhaps that is what ultimately separates us from the SS and camp kapos.	2001-11-15

The writing leaps out at you, and the epiphanies erupt in your mind like champagne bubbles.<br />In my collection are several editions, my favorite being an elegant hardback printed on superthin India paper that I love to take with me on my travels.<br />Imagine my delight to read a biography of the making of Boswell's Life. Far from a triumphal march, however, Boswell paid heavily for being the first biographer to incorporate actual conversations and comments affecting the privacy of people still living. Overnight, he found former friends crossing the street to avoid greeting him. Social to the extreme, Boswell found himself excluded from gatherings for fear that he would bring a chill to the proceedings by transcribing conversations not meant for the ears of others.<br />And yet the Life has never once been out of print. It was a best seller from the beginning, and its reputation has only grown in the years to follow. Adam Sisman's wonderful study shows us a man who was so beset upon for writing this best-seller that his heirs refused to even discuss him for several generations. While everyone praised the book, the poor author won only obloquy for being a social ingrate who scribbled down juicy bits of conversation.<br />Boswell immolated his whole life to bring us this book, and its companion journal of his and Dr. Johnson's travels in Scotland. Reflect well that fame can bear a heavy price, and that Boswell paid it in full.	2001-10-31

Byron's OXIANA looked promising, so I curled up with it for a few enchanting days.<br />Byron was no lover of pre-packaged tourist sights. He begins by slurring Venice, where he begins his journey. Later, he slams the Taj Mahal and the Alhambra as examples of what he did NOT want to see in the Middle East. At first, I was not sure where the book was going: Byron comes across at first as one of those hypereducated upper class twits who pop in and out of Evelyn Waugh's novels. Fortunately, it turns out to be just one of the author's favorite personas he assumes from time to time.<br />Over half a century ago, he saw clearly what would happen to Palestine when the British pulled out, namely, that the Jews and Arabs would be at each other's throats. As he reaches Iran we finally begin to see what Byron is really after: He travels from one old mosque or ruin to another. Although none of places he describes in such loving detail are known to me, it was easy to see that here was a man who wanted to be one of the first to see some marvel of architecture and capture it in photographs and in prose before the forces of time would destroy it utterly.<br />In the process of going from place to place, he describes the Europeans and locals he meets with humor and shrewdness. The Middle East was not the easiest place to travel in the 1930s, and Byron ran into some almost insurmountable obstacles which he typically surmounts. One such is his arrival in Aghanistan's high country too late in the season. He backtracks to Persia and waits six months until he could return in the spring.<br />I highly recommend ROAD TO OXIANA to all who wish the world was safe and innocent enough for us to pursue our own Oxianas, wherever they may be.	2001-10-25

(Sorry: writers and painters don't count.) Now imagine that you are writing a 600+ page history of Venice. How do you make it a page-turner without recourse to biography? Can it be done?<br />It seems that John Julius Norwich has done it, and with flying colors. I had originally planned to read the history in small driblets, a chapter at a time to keep my interest from flagging. I was delighted to find that my interest was engaged from the very first and remained so until Napoleon Bonaparte demonstrated to the world during his Italian campaign that the Republic could be had. Before the young emperor-to-be doused the lights, Venice had had a glorious run.<br />Here was a country that began as a naval and mercantile power. Turning its back on the Italian mainland, Venice looked to the east. Its merchants spread out through the Eastern Mediterranean and as far as the Black Sea -- and sometimes, as in the case of Marco Polo -- much farther. While mainland Italy was mired in an endless struggle between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, Venice strived to live at peace with its neighbors. For several hundred years, it even lived at peace with the Turk -- to the extent of scuttling a Crusade or two when it felt its interests were better served elsewhere. Only when the resurgent Ottomans under Mehmet II and his descendants became an effective sea power in the 15th century did Venice have to look across its moat to the Italian mainland.<br />When the Turk cut off its colonies in the East, Venice engaged in a brief career of conquest in Northern Italy with mixed results. Much more successful was its strength at diplomacy, for which it became famous. Curiously, reading this book puts the confusing history of Italy as a whole into sharper perspective if only because seen from a stable point of view. While the papacy and the city states were pulled apart or compacted like silly putty, based on the personalities and issues du jour, Venice stood serenely above the fray. What it lost on the battlefield, it won by sharp dealing. It seemed invincible ... until Napoleon entered the scene.<br />Norwich shows us all the pomp and pageantry, the masks and mummery, the octogenarian Doges and the Councils of 10, the Zontas, and all the intricate paraphernalia of Venetian governance. Instead of palling, the book could have gone on for another 600 pages before I ceased to be mesmerized.

This kind of guidebook is frequently lavishly illustrated -- though you might not want to take it with you. THE INSIGHT GUIDE TO ICELAND belongs to this category. It is printed on a nice glossy paper stock and weighs almost 2 pounds! That's about 8% of what I allow myself for total baggage for international travel.<br />The other kind of guidebook is indispensible for its wealth of detail: opening hours of attractions, accommodations, restaurants, phone numbers, addresses, websites, e-mail addresses, and other info you would use &quot;in country.&quot; Lonely Planet and Rough Guide are probably the best examples of this category: I take a razor blade and neatly remove the sections I don't need and pack the mutilated remains with my bags.<br />When I travelled to Iceland, I left my copy of the INSIGHT GUIDE at home. But I keep it to show friends where I have been and what a particular place looked like when it was NOT rainy or foggy. The photographs in this book are superb; the essays are of uniformly high quality; but it is short on up-to-date details. On the other hand, if you use it for planning or just armchair travel, you can't surpass it. It looks nicer than the Landmark Guide and the text is more interesting.<br />As Lord Dufferin wrote some 150 years ago in LETTERS FROM HIGH LATITUDES, Iceland is a very different country when the sun is shining. Of course, you can't always get that: I saw some spectacularly awful weather at Stykkisholmur and Lake Myvatn, but I can appreciate a book that shows a country wearing its best finery. I plan to keep this book and refer back to it to plan future visits to this fascinating land.	2001-10-03

When I read SOUL MOUNTAIN, I received my first education in the subject.<br />Now I have received quite by chance this children's book from University of Hawaii Press. Upon looking at it, I was drawn in by the excellent illustrations and started reading. I can't speak for what a child would think (and I don't have one to act as a guinea pig), but I loved it.<br />The book consists of four folk tales, each from a minority culture. After each tale is a description of how it has given birth to a festival, and how that festival is celebrated today. In a society such as ours which has so little understanding of other cultures, this would be a particularly painless way of introducing children to a wider, more colorful, and fascinating world. My congratulations to Carolyn and Jay Han and the excellent illustrator Li Ji.	2001-10-03

I have long admired the author's essays, and this is only my second (and far from last) foray into his fiction. Picture to yourself a story in two parts, each occupying roughly half the book. The first is a gathering of Francisco da Silva's descendents years after his death; the second follows his life from its humble beginnings in Brazil to his glory days as a much-loved and much-hated slave-trader and finally ending in his slow undoing in the vortex of passions, jealousies, and greed in the West African society in which he lives.<br />That same society was described by another great writer almost a century earlier. Sir Richard Francis Burton's A MISSION TO GELELE, KING OF DAHOMEY captures the scene perfectly some 50 years or so after da Silva's passing, including the all-female army regiments of the King and the weird dysfunctionality of his court. Chatwin seems to have taken a few leaves from Burton's book and woven a fascinating study of the rise and fall of a very limited man.<br />We never really see into da Silva's mind: In the first part of the book, he is merely a revered forefather; in the second, an adventurer whose decline is as precipitate as Citizen Kane's. The King's Amazon warriors howl at his passing: &quot;It was not the leopard that killed him. Not the buffalo that killed him. It was night. Night that killed him.&quot; That -- and everything else.<br />At no time does da Silva understand the irony of his being a slave broker whom the slaving ship captains could trust. We do not follow the slavers to the New World, just see them off at the docks as they begin their grim voyage. The Dahomean kings use da Silva, but profoundly distrust him. When he no longer serves their purpose, they and the whole society in which he lives drive him to the final extremity.<br />There is one link between the life of da Silva and the celebrations of his descendents: The character of Mama Wewe. We see her only at the end of both parts, yet she unifies and justifies Chatwin's bi-partite division. Put this one on the shelf next to Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS.d the celebrations of his descendents: The character of Mama Wewe.

The nameless operative of the Continental Detective Agency that stars in all these stories is also faceless: All we know is that he's overweight. He's every bit as nasty as the later Sam Spade of THE MALTESE FALCON, and even approaches Jim Thompson's psychotically callous narrators. At one point, in &quot;The Farewell Murder,&quot; his reaction to his client's grisly murder by slashed throat is an apparent nonchalance -- though he does nab the murderer in the end.<br />Between 1930 and today, however, there was a change in colloquial American that makes Hammett's language seem slightly fusty and unidiomatic today. The following are taken from my favorite story of the bunch, &quot;The Girl with the Silver Eyes.&quot; The larcenous Elvira, for example,  &quot;sizes up as a worker.&quot; Another woman thinks her brother is &quot;a choice morsel.&quot; An odd prolixity appears in the sentence &quot;This Porky was an effective tool if handled right, which meant keeping your hand on his throat all the time and checking up every piece of information he brought in.&quot; A writer today would be more elliptical, but then. of course,  the genre was still in its infancy.<br />Where Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe is a knight of the mean streets, the Op is an anonymous survivor. His name won't appear in the newspaper, but he'll collar the perpetrators and see them executed or otherwise put out of action. When the evidence is lacking, as in &quot;The Golden Horseshoe,&quot; he is content to have the criminal swing for a crime he did NOT commit. Better yet, in &quot;The House on Turk Street,&quot; he will arrange for the hoods to kill each other and walk away unharmed.<br />Even more than 75 years after they were written, these stories have something to tell us about ourselves today. Chandler was an Englishman; but Hammett was clearly a home-grown product of the streets.

This is their first crack at Iceland, and it is a commendable, if not outstanding, effort.<br /><br />As a result of a recent 15-day trip to Iceland, I can say that it is mostly reliable but far from exhaustive. For one thing, the emphasis is on sleeping bag accommodations exclusively. (Okay, maybe I'm not quite so &quot;rough&quot; a traveler: Two weeks in the same smelly down bag is not my idea of comfortable travel.) Also, the book omits many very viable accommodation options, such as the Bolti farmhouse at Skaftafell. Also many oustanding restaurants such as the well-known Bautinn in Akureyri are unaccountably missing.<br /><br />What did this guide have to say about my guesthouse in Reykjavik (the excellent Baldursbra)? Only that it had &quot;rather narrow beds and unfortunate floral curtains.&quot; Good grief! Firstly, the size of single beds in Iceland tends to be quite standard: No extra inches were shaved off. Secondly, the curtains were indeed floral but not so aggressively bad as suggested by the writers of the guide, who appear to have been suffering from a bad hair day.<br /><br />On the plus side, the &quot;Basics&quot; and &quot;Contexts&quot; sections are both useful and entertaining introductions to travel in this most fascinating of destinations. I've always regarded a good bibliography as an asset to any guide, and this one has an excellent one. Included is a helpful summary of the key Icelandic sagas, a knowledge of which is essential to understanding the uniqueness of Iceland.<br /><br />You won't go far wrong with this guide, but there is room for improvement in editions to come. For now, I recommend the 2001 Edition of the Lonely Planet Guide as being the most authoritative guide.	2001-09-06

To begin with, Cathy Harlow's excellent book is more along the lines of the DK Guidebooks: excellent pictures, printed on heavy glossy paper, and short on up-to-date, detailed info on accommodations and restaurants.<br /><br />In other words, this is a book to read and enjoy BEFORE going to Iceland, but it takes up too much weight for the info it conveys. Let's face it, the 20-kilo weight restriction for international flights, together with the even more severe practical limitations for people who use public transportation where there are no porters or native bearers are strong reasons to travel as light as possible.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading this book and would strongly recommend both the texts and photographs as an excellent introduction to a fascinating travel destination. Used in conjunction with the Rough Guide to Iceland or, even better, the updated Lonely Planet Guide to Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, it is a worthwhile book to read and to keep for reference.	2001-09-06

From an early age, the gigantic Grettir the Strong allows no man to show him disrespect without challenging him to a duel to the death. After one too many challenges, the combined Icelandic chieftains at the Althing sentence him to outlawry, which means, in essence, that anyone could kill him at any time without being held responsible.<br /> For a period of 19 years, Grettir moves from one part of Iceland to another, living on isolated farms or in the wild -- either alone or together with friends and sympathizers -- while relatives of those whom he had killed follow him around, setting up mostly unsuccessful ambushes. Finally, he settles on the islet of Drangey with his brother Illugi and a servant. One local farmer who owns the islet and the flock of sheep that feed there resorts out of desperation to having a magical spell placed on him that causes him to be injured, making it easy for him to kill the brothers.<br /> But because Christianity has taken root in Iceland, the chieftains are outraged at the use of magic to kill Grettir. The farmer is assailed on all sides until HE is declared an outlaw; and Grettir's half-brother chases him all the way from Norway to Constantinople avenge his death.<br /> Even while an outlaw, Grettir had visited many of the chieftains, including the legendary Snorri Priest of Eyrbyggja Saga fame, and met with sympathy. Had he lived another year, the decree of outlawry would have expired, and he would have been a free man. Grettir had good and bad qualities in abundance, including a ready wit and a meticulous sense of honor. His poems are razor sharp and earthy.<br /> Once you get past the Icelandic genealogies at the beginning, this saga reads more rapidly than any of the others I have read. It one of the most readable -- and loveable -- works of the entire Middle Ages.-- and loveable -- works of the entire Middle Ages.	2001-08-01

In his HISTORY, Gunnar Karlsson adds a fourth epoch: the 20th century.<br /> Thanks to the great Icelandic sagas of the 13th Century, we know a great deal about the first period. (Some of the excitement comes across in Magnus Magnusson's little gem of a book entitled ICELAND SAGA.) Then, once Iceland lost her sovereignty in hopes of putting an end to strife between conflicting factions, she seemingly disappeared from history. Except, unfortunately, as a victim of catacylsmic volcanic eruptions, smallpox, plague, and an uncaring Danish administration.<br /> The 19th Century saw a simultaneous enlightenment in Denmark's stewardship of Iceland and a growingly successful independence movement among Icelanders. Between the two World Wars, Iceland became an independent state of some promise and no longer the Albania of the North Atlantic.<br /> There are several approaches to chronicling such an unusual history. Karlsson takes a heavily economically and statistically oriented approach, such that one cringes at the profusion of percent signs and dates and neat little tables. Suddenly, the author will abruptly switch gears and drop into a personal mode: &quot;Most important of these wield yielders was the Iceland moss ... a lichen that grows on inland heaths. It looks extremely unappetizing -- brownish and dry, like a shrivelled piece of skin.... I personally salivate when I think about it cooked in milk.&quot;<br /> Another time, he interjects: &quot;I myself did not live in a turf house for longer than a month and was unfortunately too young to remember much about it. But in my youth ... I sometimes visied such houses, which were dry, warm, clean, and reasonably bright.&quot;<br /> One wishes to encounter this reminiscing Gunnar Karlsson more frequently than the brownish, dry, shrivelled statistician that he so often resembles. A more anecdotal approach would have livened this book up considerably, relegating most of the economic facts to out-of-the-way footnotes. I would like to have met the Icelander at various stages of his country's history, but Karlsson restrains himself from introducing him.

(In the 20th century, we had only one more: Isaac Bashevis Singer.) What makes for a great storyteller is that he creates a literary melody out of simple, believable characters and the events that overtake and carry them to some form of resolution. There is no harmony, no literary grace notes or cadenzas -- very much like a recurring tune that one cannot get out of one's head. The appeal is to something very primitive in all of us: Before we had written language, we had stories that we could marvel at and remember during those long evenings sitting around the fire.<br /> The four stories in this volume range from the ghastly &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mzinsk District&quot; about a murderess who kills for passion to the Gogolesque &quot;The Sentry&quot; about the ideal bureaucratic solution to a military transgression. Along the way, we have &quot;The Toupee Artist,&quot; a compelling tale about the evils of serfdom seen from the point of view of a serf theatrical troupe and of the place of chance in all our lives. Finally, &quot;On the Edge of the World&quot; is about a missionary Russian Orthodox bishop who learns humility from a humble monk and a heathen Siberian sledge driver during a horrible blizzard. This last story reminds me strongly of Akira Kurosawa's film DERSU UZALA, which may have been partly based on it.<br /> The Hyperion Press Classics of Russian Literature series is a gold mine of lesser-known Russian literature. Some of their editions, like Leskov's stories and those of Ivan Goncharov and Alexei Pisemskii, are to my mind on a par with the best -- whom my mother used to call, collectively, Tolstoyevsky.	2001-07-07

Tim Cahill, Bruce Chatwin, Ian Buruma, and Paul Theroux were at their height -- as well as Iyer himself with his VIDEO NIGHT IN KATHMANDU. I revelled in their writings, glorying in dangerous places I would never actually visit for fear of tropical diseases, violent bands of guerrillas or outlaws, dictatorial governments, and -- primarily -- lack of funds.<br /> Pico Iyer is a writer who skates on the surface of things touristic. He has few sustained discussions with locals who can provide some light on the strangeness reflected back at him by these surfaces. And he does not appear to have done his homework: To visit Iceland, for example, without reference to the sagas of the 13th Century is almost to miss the point. The hardiness of a people raised on the example of Gisli Sursson (Gisla Saga) or Grettir Asmundarson (Grettir's Saga) is to really grasp the Juchi Idea (of self-reliance) he discusses in conjunction with his essay or North Korea.<br /> Although he can be a tad lazy, Iyer has the gift of gab. I still remember a one-page essay he wrote ages ago for, I believe, NEWSWEEK, on the decline of the comma in writing. If he were alive today, Oscar Wilde would approve of Iyer's work. Perhaps Iyer's wit in describing these surfaces is a sign of greatness that I just fall short of fully appreciating.<br /> I remember a travel book by Graham Greene (THE LAWLESS ROADS) in which the author breaks his only set of glasses during one particularly vile stretch of terrain and suddenly launches into a vicious attack on Mexico, cursing it for the pain it put him through to research his novel THE POWER AND THE GLORY. I never get the feeling that Iyer expresses anything deeper and amusement or mild inconvenience; and I really wonder what he feels about these places he visits.

Typically (the Robert the Bruce trilogy is a notable exception), he takes either a minor or even fictional character and makes him the lens through which the characters and deeds of the times are experienced.<br /> ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY is no exception. Patrick, Earl of Dunbar and March, is made to serve as a mirror to the short reign of Alexander III (1249-1286) -- the last legitimate monarch before Edward I of England (&quot;The Hammer of the Scots&quot;) asserted his claims over the realm, leading to the Wars of the Bruces and the short career of William Wallace. As such, a pall of doom hangs over the story as Alexander's reign winds to a close.<br /> Things begin hopefully enough: Despite a long and troubled regency after the sudden death of his father in the Western Isles, Alexander asserts himself by winning a decisive victory over the Norse and their Hebridean allies at Largs (1264), after which Norway renounced all claims to the Hebrides: Never again would Viking raids be a major threat to the Scots. It is the growing aggressiveness of Edward I to the south that become ever more worrisome to the young monarch.<br /> The anxiety finds a focus in the historical character of Thomas Learmonth, known as Thomas the Rhymer or True Thomas, whose prophecies of doom clouded Alexander's last days as he sees his hopes for maintaining his dynasty crumble before his accidental death from falling off a horse. Earl Patrick serves his monarch well to the end, and then sadly returns to his lands resolved to involve himself no longer as an envoy for the monarchy. In a brief epilogue, Tranter describes how the end of the dynasty led directly to the Wars of Independence.<br /> While not the best of Tranter's work (the Bruce Trilogy takes that honor), ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY is a great read for those who, like me, prefer a large dollop of history with their fiction.read for those who, like me, prefer a large dollop of history with their fiction.	2001-06-28

Is it that we are programmed to reject everything outside our ultra-narrow Western European/North American bandwidth?<br /> I first read this translation of NJALS SAGA over 10 years ago. The story set off a series of reactions in me such that, this year, I am planning to visit the sites where the story of Njall, Flossi, and Gunnar actually took place a millenium ago. (Archaeologists have located a burned-out farmstead at the site of the famous conflagration that dates back to that time.)<br /> The story of Njall's restraint, and his preference to die with his family in a fire set by his enemies rather than to perpetuate a feud, has a resonance in our own times: Consider the Yugoslavia of Milosovich, or the genocides between the Tutsi and the Hutu in Central Africa. Even Njall's enemies have to be goaded into committing atrocity: One character implies that Flossi, the arsonist, is weak because he has allowed himself to be sexually used by the Svinafell troll. Times haven't changed much.<br /> The saga contains scenes of great beauty. Gunnar of Hlidarendi, outlawed by the Althing and forced to flee for his life, takes one backward look. &quot;How fair the slopes are!&quot; he exclaims, and then decides to stay. Under attack by his enemies, he asks his wife for a length of her hair when his bowstring breaks. The &quot;thief-eyed&quot; Hallgerd Long-Legs refuses because he had slapped her once, and so he goes to his doom muttering that each person chooses his or her fame. True to his prophecy, Hallgerd is the ultimate type of the treacherous and spiteful wife.<br /> We seem to think of Icelanders as the scions of degenerate Vikings who never amounted to much. And yet they created a republic in A.D. 870 (!!) and gave birth to a literature that will be read and loved by those who have the mind and heart to appreciate them long after most mass-produced &quot;classics&quot; are hooted off the world stage.are hooted off the world stage.	2001-06-22

They are (frequently) outlawed by the powerful kings of Norway, whom they help but whose jealousy clouds their judgment. They let no man stand in their way, and are formidable even in fights at long odds.<br /> Egil Skallagrimsson, in particular, comes across as a force of nature. We see him in action across Scandinavia, in England where he fights with King Athelstan, and as far afield as the Baltic countries. His poetry, of which there are numerous examples in the saga, are interesting -- yet come from a tradition that is alien to ours, probably much closer to BEOWULF than any other English equivalent.<br /> Unlike so many other saga heroes, Egil dies a natural death, living long enough to lose his strength and be bossed about by servant women. Yet his poetic vision remains to the end:<br /> Life fades, I must fall<br /> And face my own end<br /> Not in misery and mourning<br /> But with a man's heart.<br /> This is one of the five major Icelandic &quot;family&quot; sagas, along with NJALS SAGA, LAXDAELA SAGA, GRETTIR'S SAGA, and EYRBYGGJA SAGA. It may be the best of them all (though I have yet to read GRETTIR'S SAGA at this time). In that distant island so far from the harshness of Dark Ages Europe, a major literature was born that is dramatically different from anything else I have encountered, and that has the ability to move me as few things have.	2001-06-13

One of the advantages of reading HRAFNKEL'S SAGA and the shorter sagas and tales in this volume is that you get a good idea of the best of the genre in less than 150 pages. According to Magnus Magnusson in his excellent book ICELAND SAGA, &quot;it is nothing short of a masterpiece, a brilliantly wrought short novel that has been published and translated and written about more than any other saga.&quot;<br /> Given that, what can you expect? In the strange world of the Icelandic saga, there is little mention of the deity other than in passing: To the Icelanders of the classic age, all that mattered is what strength and cunning and stamina YOU had, and whether you could rely upon any stouthearted friends of like mettle in a pinch. At the heart of every saga are one or more conflicts. The better man does not always win; justice does not always triumph. Hrafnkel is heroic, but he is no hero: In our time, he would be a convicted felon for slaughtering his shepherd Einar. In the age of the Vikings, he was a stern man of his word in whom people could rely.<br /> Curiously, even in today's Iceland, adherence to the Judaeo-Christian tradition is seen only as an alternative, one imposed from without. The minister at the pulpit is as likely to discuss Hrafnkel and the other great Saga heroes as he is the Gospels. In a way, the sagas are taken as scripture.<br /> The oddest thing of all is that most of them were probably written by Medieval monks: Christianity there underwent a strange sea change into something rich and strange.<br /> So as you read these instructive tales, consider that they represent a different world view in a tiny island nation whose people know them by heart. The Icelandic language today is virtually identical to the Old Norse spoken by the first settlers of Iceland. Imagine if English were identical to the Anglo-Saxon of BEOWULF!	2001-06-12

Millman takes Theroux's world-weariness to higher latitudes -- from Norway across to the Shetlands and Faroes, from there to Iceland and Greenland, and ending up in Labrador.<br /> But like Theroux, Millman is wonderfully entertaining. See him witness a Faroese &quot;grindadr&aacute;p,&quot; or mass slaughter of a whole pod of whales, by throngs of gleeful Faroese bearing hooks and knives. See him wake up naked and hung over in a drainage ditch after a night of carousing in Reykjavik. And, most funny of all, see him fend off love-starved Inuit maidens in Nuuk who crave his bod and are not too dainty about their seduction technique.<br /> Millman is a bit of a loner, and yet his book sparkles most when he is interacting with the locals. Because this happens hardly at all in the Shetlands, this is the weakest part of his book. LAST PLACES picks up steam as he visits an isolated lighthouse keeper in the West Fjords of Iceland whose library extends to 16,000 volumes. His encounters with Inuits in Greenland are priceless. And the episodes in Labrador show us a land of isolated cranks and eccentrics attempting to protect their way of life from do-gooder government relocation projects.<br /> When the thermometer rises, pick up this book to cool you off. It makes for great summer reading. And it is excellent preparation for my upcoming trip to Iceland. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!	2001-06-09

This mirrors the perplexity that the young Ugla finds when she leaves the North of Iceland to live in Reykjavik as the serving girl to a powerful member of parliament.<br /> I could have laid the book aside, but I had read Laxness before and was curious to see where he would take me. Ugla becomes pregnant and returns to her family in the country to have her child and think things through and, in her words, &quot;to become a person.&quot; From crazy Reykjavik, we suddenly find ourselves in the clear light of the great Sagas of the 13th century. Here there are no harsh moral judgments; and even the Lutheran pastor refers to Gunnar of Hlidarendi in NJAL'S SAGA as being on the same plane as the Good Book.<br /> As a hardened Saga fiend, I was enthralled. Here was an Icelander saying that the answer to the topsy turvy world of Cold War Europe was to look at the past and within onseself -- to follow the God who, by definition, was the one left over when all the other ones have been named.<br /> Ugla finds her way in the end -- even if she traced a great circle in the process. Like G K Chesterton, Laxness is a great optimist; and he left this reader with a smile and the resolve to read more of his works.	2001-05-24

Both time and space are fragmented by the writer as he weaves back and forth among his stories of garlic farmers pitted against local corruption and their own at times cruel family traditions.<br /> The central event in the book is an invasion and trashing by an angry mob of the local governmental offices. We do not see this event occur until the end of the book, yet it colors every moment in the lives of the Fang and Gao families of Paradise County. It is understandable that the Beijing government would suppress a novel that shows most of its local officials to be bloated satraps and its policement to be little better than thugs, applying cattle prods to their prisoners and beating them mercilessly.<br /> Equally villainous, however, are the Fang family, who force their daughter to marry an old man in a three-in-one arranged marriage that guarantees that their crippled eldest son also gets a bride. In a grisly scene, the marriage deal finally goes through after both the daughter and her fiance commit suicide: Their bodies are dug up, their remains are mixed together, and they are re-interred in a single coffin.<br /> This is not a pleasant book to read: It takes a strong stomach, especially in the prison episodes. At the same time, it is, I feel, an important book that is beautifully written.	2001-05-16

I am planning a trip to Iceland and have been reading fairly intensively in the subject. When I began reading this book, I did not expect to learn much. What a pleasant surprise! I spent a whole Sunday poring through it and was surprised at how excellent the text is -- and how well Jon Kracauer's superb photographs supplements it.<br /> David Roberts digs deep into the sagas, quoting from such relatively abstruse sources as GIMLI'S SAGA, GRETTIR'S SAGA, and BARD'S SAGA. The helpful bibliography lists a number of works I never knew existed, including a book by Sir Richard Francis Burton, the African explorer, about a summer he spent in Iceland as well as a number of rare travel books written by Europeans going back as far as the 18th century.  One thing unique about this book is that Roberts and Kracauer visit many out-of-the-way places mentioned in the sagas, such as the almost inaccessible Isle of Drangey, where Grettir the Strong met his death.<br /> If you hope to visit Iceland, get this book first. It will give you not only an excellent background in the sagas but an awe for this isolated land that is so close and yet so far.	2001-05-08

As before, I was again exhilarated by Scherman's broad brush strokes taking in the land, its history, literature, geology, flora and fauna.<br /> Particularly well done are the chapter about NJALS SAGA, the greatest of the medieval family sagas. Yet I was also interested to find an excellent discussion of the EYRBYGGJA SAGA, which I have just finished reading. The first few chapters about the volcanic origin of the land, with the massive 1973 explosion of Eldfell on Heimaey and the recent birth of the nearby isle of Surtsey.

Partly because so few writers can create vital and interesting characters any more, O'Brian stands out with his correct Tory Naval captain (Jack Aubrey) and his British intelligence agent/scientist friend (Stephen Maturin), who show here that they can age gracefully.<br /> But don't begin here. You have to have read the series in order to understand their tangled love and financial relationships and how the situation in THE COMMODORE came to be. If you have read the others through THE WINE DARK SEA, you are in for a real treat.<br /> Aubrey and Maturin combat pro-Napoleonic forces at home and abroad. In the process, they deliver crippling blows to the West African slave trade and prevent a French landing in support of Irish independence.<br /> Now that he has risen in the ranks, Aubrey must deal with issues raised by an incompetent spit-and-polish commander like Captain Thomas and by an otherwise talented sodomite in the person of Captain Duff whose officers rebel against favoritism shown to his catamites. Throughout the book, our heroes are uncertain of the welcome they will receive from their wives and families -- yet they are driven onward for King and Country.	2001-05-02

Forget the police, forget the army. There isn't any. If you're unhappy about this, you try to get your favorite chieftain to intervene. Of course you'd better have a whole bunch of armed followers to show that you mean business. You can bet the murderer will too as a matter of course. How you come off in this hypothetical society depends on how much influence you wield on your neighbors. If you're willing to go to bat for them -- and vice versa -- your power will increase. Unless, of course, someone decides to swing an axe at your hatrack in the meantime.<br /> This is Medieval Iceland in the 13th century, when this and all the other great sagas were written. The EYRBYGGJA is one of the best of the sagas -- provided that you can handle all the genealogies. (Virtually all the people in the saga were real people; and many of today's Icelanders can trace their families back almost 1,000 years.)<br /> If there is any hero in the EYRBYGGJA, it is Snorri the Priest. He manages to maintain his power despite several threats that unfold during the several generations of this story. At times, as in the case of the feud with Arnkel, Snorri seems to be in the wrong. But he is consistently faithful to his friends and therefore has no problem raising the forces to back up his position. His life bridges the conversion to Christianity in the year 1000: Snorri proves his adaptability by going from a priest of Thor to an advocate of the new religion. In all the Icelandic sagas I've read, most of the characters do not seem to be wholeheartedly committed to either the old or the new religion; but all are superstitious about the restless dead, which brings me to one of the most fascinating aspects of this saga: the ghost episodes that seem to proliferate. I particularly like Thorolf Twist-Foot, a disagreeable old man who keeps coming back from the dead and causing trouble -- which Snorri deals with in most inimitable fashion by holding an ancient legal proceeding called a &quot;door court&quot; to expel them.<br /> My only criticism: This book needed a good set of maps for following the action.

Five philosophers (Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche) and one giant of literature (Montaigne) are enlisted to help us deal with such universal problems as popularity, sexual rejection, poverty, and inadequacy.<br /> Curiously, none of these philosophers (with the possible exception of Epicurus) led happy lives. Seneca was ordered by his pupil Nero to commit suicide; Montaigne was tortured to the point of distraction by kidney stones; and Nietzsche went mad. De Botton, however, shows how each one exhibited great common sense on at least one area in their lives.<br /> The upshot of all this advice is to consider that others have it worse, buck up, and forge ahead despite all the obstacles. Not quite what Buddha discovered beneath the Bodhi Tree, but in this era of chicken soup for whatever ails you, it's a step up. Unlike most self-help books, this one instead of bloating two paragraphs into a 100,000-word book, leaves you hungry for more. Particularly useful are the notes in back, directing the reader to the sources and presumably further enlightenment.<br /> I was a little put out that de Botton left out all mention of Boethius, whose CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY was one of the most influential books of the last 1,500 years and is still a very worthy book for accomplishing the same goals. As a skeptic, I was also disappointed that Lucian of Samosata was omitted. Oh, well, you can't criticise a book for what it was not. De Botton's selection is highly individual and, what is more,  it works.	2001-04-23

But from its very beginnings, Islam presented a clear and palpable threat to the West. Spain had already succumbed, and France was threatened by the Moors. Most shocking, the Holy Land was occupied by Turks. (Think of the response if we were to occupy Mecca and Medina!)<br /> Europe responded by the Crusades, about which we know a little, and with the military monastic orders such as the Knights Templar and Knights of St John Hospitaller, about whom we know next to nothing. These were men who lived a monastic (or at least semi-monastic) life and who acted as Christendom's shock troops in the war against the Saracen.<br /> The Crusader kingdoms of the Middle East finally fell after 300 years of constant strife, but the idea caught on in Spain in the drive to expel the Moors and in Prussia against the surrounding Northern Slav Pagans.<br /> Perhaps the most stirring tale Seward tells is of the strife between the Knights of St John, having been expelled by the Turks from Rhodes, recovering brilliantly in the siege of Malta in 1565. After demolishing a force of 30,000 with only 6,000 men, the Knights ever after became known as the Knights of Malta.<br /> Other reviewers have complained that this is a difficult book. It has to be: Almost a thousand years are covered, not to mention a score of countries.

It attempts to show the tenor of life under Janos Kadar, who served as Magyar leader from 1956 until the fall of Soviet Communism in the late 1980s. Kadar walked a delicate tightrope between pleasing Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Gorbachev -- and pleasing his people. Esterhazy depicts this period as an era of pornography: One appears willing to enjoy like the nubile beauties in a porno movie, but in reality one is appalled by the fact that one is being used.<br /> The difficulty with a long extended metaphor is either that it breaks out of its shell and goes somewhere; or, in this case, it just spirals around and sputters out inconclusively.<br /> At times, Esterhazy sounds like a Hungarian William Burroughs in THE NOVA EXPRESS. I would be curious to see how the original reads in Hungarian, because the rendition into English seems to always be just a bit unidiomatic. There are numerous English slang phrases that make it look as if the translator has a tin ear.<br /> The only reason I rated this book a 3 is that every once in a while, it seems right on target, especially in the opening section. But, as in any book that contains no characters and no story, it slips out again. The Section entitled simply &quot;?&quot; seems particularly endless and painful, with its endless interrogatories.	2001-03-23

This house is filled with lodgers who get to stay rent-free for no other reason than that they ask.<br /> Alfgrim keeps crossing paths with Gardar Holm and the young woman who wants to become the singer's lover. For some reason, the singer always cancels his appointments to the chagrin of his sponsors and fans; and the young woman, Blaer Gudmunsen, is always given the slip. The unhappy Holm is in stark contrast to Alfgrim, who maintains his balance by being suspicious of fame and content with a future of gathering lumpfish.<br /> In the end, this is an feel-good work of considerable artistry, with a masterful, rich sense of characterization. The translation by Magnus Magnusson is excellent, as befits the man who at one and the same time is both one of the best translators of Icelandic Sagas and the TV host of BBC's MASTERMIND and WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYHOW?	2001-03-19

Interspersed is a story of a difficult relationship that begins in Wuyizhen in the early episodes and lurches forward and backward until it ends in a strange stand-off toward the end. Gao avoids the big cities and travels along the southern mountain regions of China, frequently in areas not populated by the majority Han population, in search of Linshan, or soul mountain.<br /> Does he make it? Yes ... and no! It was always just across the river all the time (in a manner of speaking). Gao laments in advance the destruction about to be wreaked by the building of the projected Three Gorges dam. His China is in the course of assimilation into the Han culture, so he seeks the folkways of minority populations, the poetry, music, festivals, and religious observances.<br /> &quot;Even I can't distinguish how much is experience,&quot; writes Gao, &quot;and how much is dreams within my memories and impressions, so how can you distinguish between what I have experienced and what are figments of my imagination? And in the end is it necessary to make such distinctions? In any case, they aren't of any significance whatsoever.&quot;<br /> He's right, too. This is a book that transforms the reader. All that is asked of the reader is to shed his plausibilist prejudices and drift in the stream. The ride is well worth it!	2001-03-13

We are so fixated on the values of the Western European mainland that it is easy for us to overlook Iceland's many contributions. The great 13th century sagas like Burnt Njal, Laxdaela, and Egil are high water marks of medieval literature -- far more sophisticated than the Arthurian fantasies circulating in Britain and France at the time.<br /> To read and understand these sagas properly, one requires a key. And this is precisely the value of Byock's work: It places the sagas in a societal context and shows us that -- while Europe was stuck in a feudal rut -- Iceland was a unique republic in which power was distributed among many 30-50 chieftains. If a chieftain failed to be responsive, a landowner could change his allegiance to another, irrespective of his location. Because there were no standing armies in the time of the sagas, it was the responsiveness of the chieftain in assisting with disputes that was the prime determinant of his power, and not brute force.<br /> Byock shows us how the system worked by a series of helpful extended examples taken directly from the sagas. These are by far the best parts of the book. Read this book, and you will see that at the heart of the great sagas are tales of how conflicts were resolved, sometimes over a period of many generations. Although many lives were lost, the fabric of society remained whole and relatively undisturbed because a consensus was finally reached.<br /> I look forward to reading Byock's other Icelandic book on Feud in the Icelandic Saga.	2001-02-10

When one is faced with such a situation, there are two courses of action possible. Ronald Williams facing an even greater dearth in his excellent LORD OF THE ISLES compensated by filling in the background so that the resulting read was a much richer experience. Unfortunately, MacKay seemed to spend over half the time dealing with inconsistencies of his sources. This makes for great scholarly debates -- but I think it should be relegated to the footnotes.<br /> When I read a book about so exciting a figure as William Wallace, I do not want to know where Blind Harry went wrong and a competing source was a tad better. I want to know why the peerage of Scotland was so fickle, why Edward I had such a thing about crushing the Scots and Wallace in particular, and why -- after Falkirk -- Edward was so ineffectual in conquering Scotland.	2001-01-29

When a British yachtsman named Davies (one who would feel at home with the grundge look) discovers that a former British naval officer is in very cozy with the Germans -- did I neglect to say that the coast is East Frisia, that part of Germany between the Dutch and Danish borders? -- the mystery becomes not to find out who the guilty party is, but what type of skullduggery is afoot.<br /> The narrator is Carruthers, a British civil servant whom Davies talks into joining him under somewhat false pretenses. After some qualms, Carruthers joins in wholeheartedly. From this point on, you are looking at the coastline charts as closely as the principals are (if you don't, you will lose track of the story, which follows geographic features more closely than any other novel in memory).<br /> While the action is spectacular, Childers is noticeably weak on character, especially with regard to the sole female character, the German spy's daughter. But you can't always have everything, and what RIDDLE OF THE SANDS (1896) has to offer makes for very good reading.	2001-01-21

As an art advisor to the government, he turns in his most talented pupil Kuroda to the police, who torture him before releasing him. For most of the book, Ishiguro delicately reveals in minute increments the truth about Ono's involvement in the past regime and its effect on his life.<br /> What begins as irony softens as the novel comes to an end and we finally discover the worst is over. Ono has survived. Many of his friends have not. &quot;Ripeness is all.&quot; The floating world of the title refers to the sweet life of bars and geishas as shown by such Japanese painters as Utamaro, but here also takes on another meaning. Whether one had followed Hitler or Pinochet or Franco or Tojo, the world is full of survivors who floated through their lives taking on the coloration of their milieu.<br /> Ishiguro paints with delicate strokes, but there is congealed blood on his palette.	2001-01-12

At first glance, it is far more than its title indicates. It covers a thousand years of history in the Hebrides and the adjoining parts of Western Scotland, first under the Celtic Kingdom of Dalriada beginning around 500 AD; secondly under Viking and mixed-blood Viking/Celtic kingships from around 800-1250 AD; finally under the Lordship of the Isles centered at Loch Finlaggan in Islay until the forfeiture of the Lordship around 1500 AD.<br /> For one who, like me, is enthralled by Scottish history, this is a page-turner of the first order. I first became interested in the Lords of the Isles from reading Nigel Tranter's historical novels; then, I visited the Isles myself in 1999. Now, after having read this book, I feel energized enough to return to Scotland and become even more informed thanks to this excellent history on a subject about which little is known.<br /> One particularly excellent aspect of Williams's book is its detailed coverage of parallel events in Ireland, Norway, and England which affected the Isles. We see such heroic figures as St Columba of Iona, Aedan the Fair-Haired of Dalriada, Brian Boru, Somerled MacGillibride, Angus Og (friend and chief support of Robert the Bruce), and warlord Donald Balloch.<br /> This reprint edition is published by House of Lochar located on the Isle of Colonsay in the Hebrides. It's worth taking some pains to lay hands on this book.	2001-01-08

It is an unusual combination, but one that works surprisingly well.<br /> John Grady Cole and Lacey Rawlins are young cowpunchers who escape the postwar breakup of the range to head for one of the giant Mexican latifundos where one can ride a week before reaching the next estancia. Their work with horses and cattle is pure lyricism, such as the episode where the two promise to break sixteen wild mares in four days to get in good with ranch owner Don Hector and also for the sheer love of it.<br /> Their idyll is broken twice, once by the irresponsible young Jimmy Blevins who insists on tagging along with them and causing a broad swath of disaster in his wake, and the other time by John Grady's falling in love in Alejandra, the ranch owner's daughter. There is a sinister linkage effected when the outraged rancher has the Federales pick up Cole and Rawlins as suspected accessories to Blevins's crimes.<br /> For me, the culminating moment of the novel comes when McCarthy writes: &quot;He thought that in the beauty of the world were hid a secret. He thought the world's heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world's pain and its beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for the vision of a single flower.&quot;<br /> Cole and Rawlins's crossing of the Rio Grande was to be their initiation into a terrible knowledge whose consequences they barely escape with their lives. Blevins, on the other hand, is killed; and Alejandra, dishonored in the eyes of her family.<br /> A very powerful and very great novel!	2001-01-04

(Of a projected twelve episodes, Dickens wrote six before his death.) The title character is either murdered or missing, and a large cast of characters in London and Cloisterham (Dickens's Rochester) are involved in their own way in discovering what happened to Edwin Drood.<br /> There is first of all John Jasper, an opium addict who suspiciously loves Drood's ex-fiancee; there is a nameless old woman who dealt him the opium who is trying to nail Jasper; there is a suspicious pile of quicklime Jasper notices during a late night stroll through the cathedral precincts; there is Durdles who knows all the secrets of the Cathedral of Cloisterham's underground burial chambers; there is the &quot;deputy,&quot; a boy in the pay of several characters who has seen all the comings and goings; there are the Anglo-Indian Landless twins, one of whom developed a suspicious loathing for Drood; there is the lovely Rosebud, unwilling target of every man's affections; and we haven't even begun talking about Canon Crisparkle, Datchery, Tartar, and a host of other characters. All we know is that the game is afoot, but we'll never know the outcome.<br /> It would have been nice to know how Dickens tied together all these threads, but we can still enjoy THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD because -- wherever Dickens was heading with it -- it is very evidently the equal of his best works. Life is fleeting, and not all masterpieces are finished.	2000-12-28

Here I am sitting on a chair and pecking at a keyboard with a monitor and computer in front of me. At least I think so. But what if the sushi I had for lunch was spiked with a psychotropic drug that makes me believe that this typing at the keyboard activity is real? Especially when, in actual reality, I may be strung up stark naked and upside-down in a subterranean dungeon with rats gnawing at my vitals while happily thinking up what to write about Stanislaw Lem's greatest book, THE FUTUROLOGICAL CONGRESS.<br /> The reason why I believe that some of the best sci-fi since WW2 came from Eastern Europe (Lem from Poland and Boris and Arkady Strugatsky from Russia) is that the mind set of communism was conducive toward what is referred to as &quot;aesopic writing&quot; (The term comes from Solzhenitsyn.) If you protested anything, you were regarded as a traitor to the state; but if you wrote fables as the Greek writer Aesop did which were not set in a particular unnamed repressive regime at a particular time, you might be able to get away with it scot free.<br /> Lem had a field day by speculating on a congress who members are drugged into thinking they are drugged into acting as if they were drugged ... it goes on and on. The more or less classical beginning descends into multiple levels of questioning every level into reality, until even the most utterly solipsistic stance is questioned. By that time, you are either confused or, if you're like me, laughing your head off. As they say in another context, unreal!	2000-12-23

Yet there he is, working his way along the underside of the boot of Italy as a traveller. Even then, the area was known primarily for its rural poverty and has not attracted tourism at any time in its existence since the Greeks settled there over 2,000 years ago.<br /> And yet this is perhaps Gissing's most charming book. He becomes ill, is taken care of by strangers, does his best to escape the clutches of the local bands of outlaws, and succeeds in his quest to see a corner of Europe known to few outside of Italy.<br /> I highly recommend this book as the best introduction to a writer who deserves a revaluation of his literary reputation.	2000-12-02

It is an elegant dance between a self-satisfied gourmand who has a taste for young women whose lives are disordered, luring them into his web ever so slowly and cutting off their lives. Felicia is different from the others in one important respect: She has caught they eye of the benign but determined Miss Calligary, a Jamaican street preacher who strives to &quot;gather in&quot; disturbed souls.<br /> Many critics have criticized the character of Felicia for being insufficiently realized. She is like Lena Grove from Faulkner's LIGHT IN AUGUST: Without being a developed character in her own right, her pregnant wanderings and confusion set the evil or craven minds of the people around her in motion. Fortunately, it is Felicia who quite unawares sends Miss Calligary and her &quot;Gatherers&quot; after the startled Hilditch.<br /> A book well worth reading from an author whose work I would like to explore in greater detail.	2000-12-02

It is well written and very funny in parts as it roars through all of Western Civilization at supersonic speeds. My idea of preparing for a vacation is to read 20-30 books regarding the history, art, and literature of my vacation destination. In a way, it prolongs the pleasure of the trip.<br /> At the same time, I am aware that even a greater percentage of travelers are purely experiential: They like to plop themselves into the middle of a foreign culture and just wonder as they wander. For this type of traveler, EUROPE 101 is ideal: It gives you the bare essentials so that you don't come across like a total yahoo. If you are this type of traveller, then the book gets five stars.	2000-11-23

His masterpiece, PERE GORIOT, has resonated across over 30 years since that happy moment in 1968 when I first sat down to dine at Mme de Vauquer's boarding house, since I first heard the whispered confidences of Mme de Nucingen and the sighs of the Duchesse de Langeais, and since I first ran into that master criminal Vautrin.<br /> Balzac was at the same time an extraordinarily ambitious man and one who knew the limits of fame and fortune. For years he chased his Polish countess, and no sooner did he win and marry her than he fell ill and died. I would like to think that there was a smirk on his face as he saw the irony: He was himself a character in a Balzac novel, a composite of all his characters -- whether of the court or the hovel, from bankers to ragpickers, high and low.<br /> On the surface, this is a modern day version of Lear: An old man gives everything to his ambitious daughters and dies. The focus of the story, however, is no more on Papa Goriot and his daughters than on all the other characters in the story: the ambitious Rastignac, the plotting Vautrin, the good Dr. Bianchon, the clueless Victorine, the struggling Delphine de Nucingen -- all are caught in a web. (As was Balzac.)<br /> This book changed the way I see the world. It can do no less for you. It is as if, suddenly, the mist that hides the motives of men parts, and we see the world of men as it really is, with all the marionette strings tangled up as each puppet strives to claw its way toward the top.	2000-11-22

In it, we are taken back to the Scotland of Alexander II, where perils within and without the monarchy are threatening to destroy the kingdom's peace. Between the constant nibbling at the borders from England's Henry III, the Lords of the Isles, Norway's King Haakon, and even Olaf &quot;The Morsel&quot; Godfreyson, the diminutive King of Man.<br /> We see events unfold through the eyes of a young nobleman, Patrick Master of Dunbar, who was to rise to become the Earl of Dunbar and March, Chancellor and finally the Constable of the Realm. Patrick serves as Alexander's right arm, his &quot;sword of state,&quot; as well as his close friend.<br /> The events of this novel occur in the century before William Wallace and Robert the Bruce of BRAVEHEART fame. Tranter, as in all his royal novels, shows Scotland as a land whose survival was always threatened -- and a land that gave birth to heroes and traitors in every generation. Although I have read almost 20 of Tranter's historical novels, the author's knowledge of his country's history and his skills as a storyteller make every one of them a thrilling and informative experience.<br /> If you like historical novels and have blood in your veins, read Nigel Tranter.	2000-11-15

Few knew he was paying tribute to another writer, now almost forgotten, who wrote about the mean streets of London's Docks around 1900. In TALES OF MEAN STREETS, CHILD OF THE JAGO, and THE HOLE IN THE WALL, Arthur Morrison wrote about the world into which he was born. (Interestingly, he also wrote some great detective novels at the same time that Doyle was writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.)<br /> Some of the stories in TALES OF MEAN STREETS seem sentimental today: There is no lurid sex, the cursing is subject to the &quot;code&quot; of Queen Victoria's day, and much of the violence takes place off stage. If you accept the givens of that day, you will enjoy Morrison; and you will see how the American detective novel and the film noir owe far more to Morrison than to Conan Doyle or anyone else. Morrison deserved to be remembered and honored.	2000-11-09

Everyone knows that the Loire Valley of France has hundreds of striking chateaux, but few know that for over 100 years, the kings of France preferred to live along the Loire rather than exposing themselves to the (then) noisome stinks of Paris and its rabble.<br /> Philippe Barbour's excellent guide gives you the background to travel intelligently. You, too, will know how Charles VIII, Conqueror of Milan, died (by bumping his head on a low door at the Chateau of Amboise); how it happens that the Chateau of Cheverny still sports its original furnishings (the same family has dwelt there since before the Revolution); and how Marie de Medicis disposed of her dead husband's mistress Diane de Poitiers (she exiled her to the Cheateau de Chaumont -- I can imagine a worse fate). You will learn that the Loire was not only the home of the French kings, but also the literary giants Rabelais and Balzac, both of whom wrote prolifically about the valley of their birth.<br /> At the same time, Barbour's book is a highly acceptable guidebook for accommodations and restaurants -- if you remember that the book was published in 1997. Cadogan does not redo its guides every year, so they tend to emphasize background information that supplements other, more up-to-date guides like those produced by Rick Steves or Frommer.<br /> If you don't want to travel uninformed, this is perhaps your best bet for obtaining the background you need painlessly.	2000-10-30

I had to wait over 20 years before Volume I came back into print -- and then in one glorious summer I read all three volumes. (Just recently, I sprang for the deluxe Folio Society hardbound edition: I mean to re-read it some day.)<br /> If you have any interest in the Middle Ages, or even in the pre-history of today's Middle East crises, this series is your starting point. The crusades bring together the best and worst of men, from Godfrey of Bouillon and Saladin on one hand, to the bickering kinglets of the later Crusades on the other.<br /> The story of the Crusader Kingdoms is the subject of this volume. It is a long story of greed and attrition, leading to their extinction as the Saracens' power waxed and the Western monarchies' political will and religious zeal waned. The rise of nationalism in Western Europe sounded the death knell to the centuries'-long quest to regain the Holy Land.<br /> Curiously, it was the Saracens who were tolerant to their subject peoples, and the Crusader Kingdoms who were not. The Jews and Christians had a much better time of it under Turkish rule than under the voracious princelings of the Kindgoms of Armenia, Edessa, Jerusalem, and so on. We have yet to learn our lessons from this conflict -- and we are still paying the price.	2000-10-24

An illiterate 9-year-old witch's assistant, Eskarina (or just Esk) Smith, is by an odd mischance left with a wizard's staff and decides she wants to become a wizard. That upsets the wizards of the Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork because it's somehow against the &quot;lore,&quot; though no one could quite find the exact reason why. She is aided by Granny Weatherwax, her witch mentor, who is one of the most fully realized comic characters this side of Dickens.<br /> For instance, she finds lodgings &quot;on the top floor next to the well-guarded premises of a respectable dealer in stolen property because, as Granny had heard, good fences make good neighbors.&quot; Pratchett abounds in wonderfully graphic puns and felicitous expressions: &quot;The air was full of the busy silence of the night, which is created by hundreds of small furry things treading very carefully in the hope of finding dinner while avoiding being the main course.&quot;<br /> I won't say what happens, because that would be telling. This is the first of Pratchett's novels set in Ankh-Morpork. Pratchett is never more comfortable than describing this congenial hellhole. (For example: &quot;There was also the distinctive river smell of the Ankh, which suggested that several armies had used it first as a urinal and then as a sepulcher.&quot;)<br /> Some day when you are really down and need a wondrous lift, pick up this story of how Granny Weatherwax helped Esk become a bona fide wizard.	2000-10-21

We tend to see the statuary, but rarely the person behind it. When you read this outstanding selection edited by the excellent classical historian Michael Grant, you see that Marcus Tullius Cicero has a human face -- and it shows in his work.<br /> The Roman Republic that Cicero loved was falling apart. Marius and Sulla, the Gracchi, the conflicts over the powers of the tribunes had dealt a severe blow to a form of government that had proved itself adequate for governing a city-state, but less so for managing a multi-cultural empire. Cicero fought valiantly against corrupt governors like Verres (&quot;Against Verres&quot;) and would-be dictators like Marc Antony (&quot;2nd Phillipic Against Antony&quot;). When he finally threw in his lot with Pompey, he picked the wrong horse and put himself in harm's way. Eventually, Augustus and Antony had him killed as an obstacle to their plans.<br /> The wonderful letters that Cicero wrote to his friend Atticus and others such as Pompey show his hurt at having been rudely pushed aside. He saw himself as the Savior of Rome for his part in quashing the conspiracy of Catiline, but he lived in a world where &quot;What have you done for me lately?&quot; was the question of the day.<br /> Increasingly, Cicero turned to farming and philosophizing. His essays &quot;On Duty&quot; and &quot;On Old Age,&quot; reprinted here, are penetrating, humane, and even Christian in a way. One could see why monk copyists of the Middle Ages saw in the Roman senator a pre-Christian piety at work.<br /> Michael Grant supplies an excellent introduction, maps, genealogical charts, timelines, and even a glossary to guide the reader through Cicero's work. This book is definitely a keeper.	2000-10-17

Frankly, my expectations of show biz autobiographies is not high: Everyone seems to be so intent on blowing his or her own horn. Bond is a refreshing exception.<br /> First of all, I think the Little Rascals walk on water. Hundreds of years from now, some extraterrestial on the Moons of Jupiter with all z's and x's in his (its?) name will enjoy these short films as much as I did when I was growing up. They are universal in their appeal. We still haven't got to the point in our society that a Stymie, a Farina, or a Buckwheat can live next door to a Spanky, an Alfalfa, or a Butch. Hal Roach's Little Rascals were way ahead of their time.<br /> Of course, we all know what happened. MGM bought Our Gang from Roach and trashed the whole concept. It was time to move on and -- like so many child stars -- turn to booze, drugs, or crime. But wait a minute! Butch escapes the cliche and turns to radio, film, and even TV. And he marries the Texas beauty queen and lives happily ever after. Bond has this talent for reinventing himself and going from one positive experience to the other.<br /> Now who would have thought that the one member of the Little Rascals you should have grown up emulating was Butch the bully?<br /> This is a book that is not only well written: It will make you feel good about life.	2000-10-14

Previous guides I have used have been for France and Scotland, and both were excellent.<br /> On the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the restaurant recommendations (though I did not have the opportunity of staying at any hotels this time) and I liked the organization of the beginning as a neighborhood-by-neighborhood tour of New York. Many guides are so Manhattan-centric as to leave a false impression of the Big Apple: This one was remarkably even-handed throughout.<br /> Curiously, the main problem was that, at times, the authors did not know whether to describe a particular tourist sight in terms of the neighborhood chapter or in terms of the museums chapter. At times, such as in the description of the Fraunces Tavern, one is sent scurrying between chapters. Other than this, I felt that this guide deserved five stars.<br /> The numerous black and white maps are of high quality, and the index is particularly useful given the book's organization. This one's a winner.	2000-10-13

There are very few free-form practitioners of the art who take you down entirely different paths &quot;where no man has gone before.&quot; Off hand, I can think of only three: the late John Cowper Powys, Olaf Stapledon, and Edgar Allan Poe.<br /> Reading THE HISTORY, I felt I was in the world of Poe's NARRATIVE OF A. GORDON PYM: There was a sense that anything could happen. The giant wave that inundates the world not only destroys but seems to modify the nature of reality. Solid land could suddenly turn squishy. Strange monsters from the sea, called Gugs, prey on man. A lemur becomes a man and creates a disfunctional anti-human society. Ships without sails or oars sail against the current, because that is where &quot;they&quot; want to go. Then there is the matter of the horror in the yellow Volkswagen.<br /> Klein is obviously a bibliophile. The only things that stem the irreality are -- books! When the narrator, Paul Sant, stumbles upon a library, the tide begins to turn against the squishiness. In the first part of history, the one tower of sanity is Hiram Bell, who holds tight onto one book, Stoddard's STEAM ENGINES, and manages to create an island of reality.<br /> As I finished the last pages of this book, I can only express the hope that Klein continues writing.

Henk van Woerden's excellent &quot;The Assassin&quot; is about a man who had no sense of identity, and whose attempt to find one led to the assassination of South African premier Hendrik Verwoerd in September 1966. His Demetrios Tsafendas is a man without a country, without a religion, and without the human affiliations that seem to make life worth living.<br /> Other pieces in this thread are Hanif Kureishi's arresting &quot;Goodbye, Mother&quot; about a son's inability to deal with his aging mother; Graham Swift's &quot;Our Nicky's Heart,&quot; about a boy's death in a motorcycle accident and its strange aftermath; and especially Richard Williams's haunting &quot;Gifted,&quot; about his search for jazz trumpeter Dupree Bolton, one of the best written pieces I have ever read on the subject of jazz. Also, I must add Kent Klich's sad &quot;Born in Romania,&quot; about HIV-positive Romanian children whom he photographed, many of whom died before the article went to press.<br /> I enjoyed Diana Athill's &quot;Editing Vidia,&quot; a contribution in the emerging subgenre of why V.S. Naipaul is not likeable (adding to Paul Theroux's article last year in the NEW YORKER). The question I ask is, what does that have to do with Naipaul's work? Niceness is not a trait common to all great artists, so why belabor the point?<br /> There are also short pieces by Paul Theroux and Keith Ridgway that struck me more as fillers for an otherwise excellent issue of this indispensable publication.	2000-09-26

In a book by a dullard, this would be excruciating. But  Burckhardt is anything but as he manages his material like a Moscow taxi  driver: by accelerating and then coasting. When you least expect it,  another epiphany draws you in.<br /> Burckhardt's Renaissance was an  incredible high in the history of mankind. The Medicis, Sforzas, and  Malatestas strut their way through the history of the period; Dante,  Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bramante create works of the imagination that  still overpower us; popes like Julius II, Alexander VI, and Leo X combine  worldliness with spirituality (sometimes); and even the average man has a  face and a voice for the first time.<br />This book will make your blood race.	2000-09-18

He lived  most of his life one step from his creditors: his house in Paris even had a  special exit for avoiding them. CESAR BIROTTEAU is the story of an honest  perfumer who is done in by the smarmy du Tillet, a former employee whom he  had fired for embezzlement, who works in secret to take his revenge.<br />  Birotteau is lured into overextending himself and falls hard. True to his  fascination with money and its epedemiology, Balzac delves into the guts of  this bankruptcy and shows you all the forces at work to destroy an innocent  man.<br /> This time, the innocent man prevails. Thanks to the help of  Anselme Popinot, a brilliant young marketer in love with his daughter,  Birotteau is able to pay back every cent, winning honor for himself after  his life appeared to be all but over.<br /> This is one of Balzac's greatest  novels. Birotteau is an honorable gentleman of the old school, a bit obtuse  perhaps, but out of his depth among the wild speculations of the reign of  Charles X. Watching these processes ensnare him is repellingly fascinating  -- and Balzac spares us nothing.	2000-09-08

I decided to tell him the story from memory of  how Hernan de Cortez, with a handful of men, brought down an entire world.  I had just finished reading Collis's book, and also Bernal Diaz's  first-hand account of the same story and Prescott's able retelling in THE  CONQUEST OF MEXICO, so it was still fresh in my mind. The boy was  entranced.<br /> Maurice Collis's is by far the best telling of the story as  such. (Prescott and Diaz are both worth reading if you have the chance.) I  collect Collis and love everything I have ever read by him.<br /> There are,  of course, two sides to every story. Cortez's gain was Montezuma's loss:  And it was the Aztecs' loss. According to J. Eric S. Thompson in MAYA  HISTORY AND RELIGION, approximately 80% of the population of what is now  Mexico died of measles, smallpox, malaria and other diseases brought by the  Spanish within a very short time. The Aztecs' sacred books were burned as  heresy; their language (Nahuatl) is dying out; and the name and image of  Montezuma are absent in the Mexico of today. Only Cuauhtemoc, who resisted  Cortez and his lieutenants, is honored.<br /> Read this book and marvel at  how tenuous a civilzation can be. It took Rome over a thousand years to  fall: Tenochtitlan fell in a year.	2000-09-07

In THE VENETIAN TWINS, one brother shrugs his shoulders when his twin dies.  In this play, MIRANDOLINA, a mistress of an inn toys with the affections of  three noblemen who are staying there as well as of her manservant. The  noblemen are drawn in broad brush strokes: one is a proud miser (the  marquis); another, a brash money-solves-everything type (the count); the  third, a self professed woman-hater (the baron). The main action of the  play is how the woman, Mirandolina, chips away at the baron's misogyny  while the marquis and the count vent their envy. Things get too hot,  however, and Mirandolina has to make a choice. But I won't give away the  ending. Sorry.<br /> Goldoni's plays are artfully written and look as if they  would play well on the stage. It is said that Goldoni's main contribution  is putting words in the mouth of the pantomime commedia dell'arte  characters. When one does that, however, and still retains the commedia  conventions, the result can come across as nasty and cold.	2000-09-03

The three stories  in this volume take place in a strange twilight world in which the author,  as he says in THURSDAY, makes you want to see the lamppost by the light of  the tree rather than vice versa. This, by the way, is his most profound and  eccentric book.<br /> In THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY, we see an incredible  global conspiracy dissipate like swamp gas. (As Calvin Coolidge once said,  nine out of ten of the troubles one sees down the road swerve off and  disappear before they get to you.) THE BALL AND THE CROSS is about two  heretics who appear to fight each other to the bitter end, until they find  a worse enemy. And THE CLUB OF QUEER TRADES is a delightful entertainment  made up of wonderful shaggy dog stories, much like THE PARADOXES OF MR  POND.<br /> If life hasn't been going your way, curl up with this volume --  and you WILL feel better.	2000-09-01

For once, he  does a great job showing bus as well as subway routes (a problem with the  Paris and London guides). The introductory material on places of interest  and the back-of-the-book guide to parks, New York architecture,  entertainments, and walking tours are compact and exceedingly well done.<br /> My only complaint is that not exactly all of Manhattan is mapped:  missing are Inwood, Washington Heights, Spanish Harlem, and parts of  Harlem. Okay, so these aren't exactly the biggest tourist draws, but I  would kind of like to see how to get to the Cloisters and a couple of other  tourist sights. Perhaps the publisher should have drawn a few pictures of  dragons and sea monsters along the unmapped tierra incognita...<br /> But why  kvetch? So there's a slice taken out of the Big Apple!

Then bushwhack him and and his family and put them all  to the sword. There will be settlements to be paid based on your wealth and  influence and that of your victim's friends and remaining family, and the  desire of your neighbors to put a cap on a burgeoning intergenerational  blood feud. Divorce? Tell your old man you've had it with him, march away,  and lay claim to half of his estate. (This while women in mainland Europe  barely had the right to breathe.)<br /> The LAXDAELA SAGA is one of the best  of the sagas, ranking with THE BURNT NJAL SAGA as one of the greatest works  to come from the Viking world -- and the greatest literary works of the  12th-14th centuries from anywhere. Its numerous cast of characters (I count  189 names in the book's helpful Glossary of Proper Names, about 40 of which  begin with &quot;Thor&quot;) boggles the mind. Just remember, these were  real people, and their names are enshrined in the history of Iceland by  their descendents.<br /> It takes several generations of ambushes, conniving  marriages and bloody divorces, and even the introduction of Christianity  around A.D. 1000 before the main story gets under way, namely the story of  Gudrun Osvifs-daughter and her four marriages. This is no blushing romance:  Look at Gudrun the wrong way, and start drafting your will! Her boyfriend  Kjartan Olafsson dallies too long in Norway, and she marries his cousin  Bolli out of spite. Then, when he returns, she does everything she can to  urge Bolli to kill him and his men. A series of internecine feuds breaks  out, and it takes more than twenty years for the bad blood to be drained  off.<br /> Even minor characters suddenly come to life. Here is how Vigdis  Ingjalds-daughter treats a man she regards as dishonorable: &quot;Vigdis  went indoors to a chest that belonged to Thord [her husband] and there, at  the bottom, she found a heavy purse. She took the purse and went out with  it to Ingjald [no relation], and told him to take his money. Ingjald  cheered up at this and held out his hand for it. Vigdis raised the purse  and struck him on the nose with it, drawing blood; she accompanied this  with a stream of derisive words, adding that he would never get the money  back, and told him to clear off.&quot;<br /> Life was cheap in medieval  Iceland. The anonymous author of this saga was, however, a great writer who  identified closely with the people and events that went into the making of  this sometimes barbaric, always awe-inspiring masterpiece.rd [her husband] and there, at  the bottom, she found a heavy purse.

Then there's the gritty, no-hope, hardscrabble world of the stories in this  GRANTA anthology.<br /> Good writing is alive and well Down Under. Some of  the pieces were haunting, especially Ben Rice's &quot;Pobby and  Dingan,&quot; about a child's invisible friends who take on a whole new  reality; Paul Toohey's &quot;The Road to Ginger Riley,&quot; about the last  days of a drunken journalist who wants to &quot;find&quot; Australia before  he dies; and Thomas Keneally's &quot;My Father's Australia,&quot; about  life in a small town before World War I.<br /> The Aborigines are a ghostly  presence in this anthology, except for Robyn Davidson's eerie  &quot;Marrying Eddie&quot; and Polly Borland's haunting photos and  interviews of Aborigine men and women spiralling down into oblivion.  There's no COOPER'S CREEK heroism here: You have to find your own way,  Mate!<br /> However dark the vision of most of these selections, this volume  is a worthy addition to GRANTA's growing library of stories and essays.

I luckily  picked up MEN AGAINST THE SEA and quickly became engrossed. Where the  prequel, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, was a story of a mutiny, this one was one of  the best men against the elements stories ever penned. We see a very  different Captain Bligh, whose temper still flares up from time to time,  but who this time is successful in managing a small crew of men in an open  boat over 3,000 miles from the site of the mutiny to Timor, which is today  part of Indonesia.<br /> Fletcher Christian and his mutineers allow Bligh and  his loyalists no guns, three cutlasses, a small medical kit, and a pitiful  store of water and victuals. Their boat must skirt all inhabited islands  because they had no gifts to give to the natives -- which in the islands at  that time meant that they were risking attack every time. Their water  supply came from rainstorms and occasional landings for food. They had no  gear for fishing. All they had to go on were Bligh's knowledge and guts.<br /> I actually prefer this book to MUTINY and now eagerly look forward to  seeing if PITCAIRN'S ISLAND, the third volume in the trilogy, is as good.	2000-08-07

What I found was an always passionate, but not  always on-target study of the Italian people by one of their own. While not  all books on national character on worth reading, this one has merit.<br />  Instead of looking at THE ITALIANS as a cohesive book, which it is not, I  suggest you take it as a series of chapters -- some brilliant and right on  the mark, others overstating a simple truism. In the former category, we  have the two brilliant chapters at the end on Italian history after the  defeat at Fornovo in 1495, and how foreign intervention led to the  development of the Baroque in art, music, and life. Less effective are the  chapters on Italian family life and how to succeed in Italy without half  trying.<br /> Barzini was dumbfounded at how the world was (and apparently  still is) beating a path to Italy without understanding what every Italian  knows. He asks, &quot;Why did Italy, a land notoriously teeming with  vigorous, wide-awake and intelligent people always behave so feebly? Why  was she invaded, ravaged, sacked, humiliated in every century, and yet  failed to do the simple things necessary to defend herself?&quot;<br /> THE  ITALIANS does not answer these questions; but the fact that it posits them  and comes close to answering them makes it a remarkable failure. I believe  this book has been more or less continuously in print for 36 years, and  with good reason.<br /> Italy may seem at times like the animated,  gaily-bedizened clown from the commedia dell'arte; but in reality, she is  more like the tragic clown Pagliacci from Leoncavallo's opera, who, cruelly  traduced, forces himself to laugh through his tears.	2000-08-05

Because we tend to plan our itineraries in advance, it was important that we get some idea of which tourist sights were worth seeing. The DK  Eyewitness guides are great for this purpose: They are lavishly  illustrated, with colorful maps, schematics, and -- above all --  photographs of tourist destinations in and around Amsterdam.<br /> I would  NOT, however, recommend that you take this guide with you. It weights 1  pound 3 oz; and we always travel light. So what we recommend is to do your  Stateside planning with the DK guide and use a lighter one to accompany you  on your travels. It's a pity, because the transportation and street maps  alone are worth the price of the guide.<br /> A major plus for us is that we  chose to visit the Zuiderzee Museum in Enkhuizen partly because it looked  interesting in the book; and it turned out to be by far our favorite stop.<br /> Like other DK guides, this one has an excellent &quot;Practical  Information&quot; section on currency, banking, telephoning, and public  transportation. It also have colorful pictures of the type of food you  might encounter in Amsterdam's restaurants. (And do try the raw new herring  with onions and pickles: If you're a sushi-head like me, you will be in  heaven.)<br /> Where I would not use this guide is for names of specific  hotels and restaurants. The information on these is presented in tabular  format and leaves off many interesting sidelights that would be important  for us as travellers, such as roominess, charm, family ownership, and other  intangibles.<br /> It's well worth the somewhat steep price to buy this book  if you're planning a trip to the Netherlands.	2000-08-01

Coming back to it after all this time, my overwhelming impression was how much Conrad had compressed into so few pages. TYPHOON can easily be read in a  single sitting; but don't plan on going to bed right after. Not without a  good stiff drink.<br /> The Nan-Shan, a steamer of Siamese registry but with  English officers, and with a cargo of Chinese coolie laborers returning  from a stint overseas, encounters a deadly typhoon and somehow survives it.  We see the story unfold through the eyes of Jukes, the first mate, who is  awed by his stoic Captain MacWhirr's quiet resolve in the face of a storm  of the century.<br /> Reading it, I felt transported to the Northridge  Earthquake of 1994. A sound as of all the demons of hell -- shaking and  rolling in six directions at once -- flashes of light from exploding  transformers -- barefooted stumbling for my boots in a world of broken  glass and crockery -- found by the police hours later walking down the  street, stunned,  with blood pouring from my ankle and a gallon jug of  water in my hand.<br /> Or, replace it with an equivalent experience of your  own. Conrad had looked death in the face and learned how to face it. His  Captain MacWhirr stands fast in the fury and doesn't let his imagination of  untold horrors interfere with guiding the ship through the storm. At one  point, he tells Jukes in the wheelhouse, &quot;We must trust her [the ship]  to go through it and come out the other side, That's plain and  straight.&quot;<br /> Conrad is a wise teacher and a great writer. TYPHOON  did more than survive a second reading: It awed me a second time. If I may  quote once more from the book: &quot;MacWhirr had sailed over the surface  of the oceans as some men go skimming over the years of existence to sink  gently into a placid grave, ignorant of life to the last, without ever  having been made to see all that it may contain of perfidy, of violence,  and of terror.&quot;<br /> MacWhirr's initiation into this perfidy, violence,  and terror shows us how we might likewise survive the storms and shipwrecks  of our own lives.

Why aren't Americans ever that funny?<br />  Please forgive me, however, for being just a little heretical. I liked the  characters of Rincewind and Twoflowers, was intrigued by The Luggage (I  want one!), and loved Cohen the Barbarian.

Rincewind and Twoflower were both --  dare I say it? -- schmoes at the beginning of the book and and at the end.<br /> I think that Pratchett has a real affinity for Ankh-Morpork, and the  farther he strays from it, the less vital his stories appear.  (I except  SMALL GODS, which is a real tour de force.) So, bring on the Pratchetts,  and let's have more of the Night Watch and Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, more  trolls and golems, and lots more of that beauty spot on (or, actually,  near) the Circle Sea -- Ankh-Morpork.	2000-07-26

Of all the great books of the 20th century, which one could compare with its raw nerve and sinew?  Here are no word games, no playing with the chronology, no obfuscation.  With the limpid prose that had become his trademark, Maugham took us by the  most direct route into his own private inferno.<br /> What in his hero  Philip Carey was a clubfoot was for Maugham a painful stammer. What was  Carey's public school at &quot;Tercanbury&quot; was Maugham's Canterbury.  And, what is most interesting, what were Carey's tortured amours with the  opposite sex were Maugham's tortured amours with the same sex. Yet with all  the &quot;translation&quot; going on, the intensity of the feelings was  transferred intact. The pain of Philip's on-again off-again relationship  with Mildred has few equals in the literature of self-torture and  self-delusion, ranking with Swann's pursuit of Odette de Crecy.<br /> OF  HUMAN BONDAGE is a big book. There are hundreds of characters; and many of  the lesser characters are memorable. The ineffectual dilettante Hayward,  the skeptical poet Cronshaw, the icily bland Mildred, the despairing artist  Fanny Price, the treacherous Griffiths -- even the walk-on role of grumpy  old Dr. South comes alive in the last few pages of the novel.<br /> The  settings are equally diffuse: London, the English countryside, Heidelberg,  Paris, a Channel fishing village, and -- an amusing canard -- Toledo in  Spain. (Carey is always dreaming of going there, but he never does.)<br />  When one is young, life looks like a triumphant progress through love,  fame, and wealth. There appears, however, to be an inherent weakness in the  organism; and it tends to go astray more than it does forward. We give  ourselves to uncaring people; we constantly meet with reverses; we see our  childhood dreams trampled by money-grubbing and the quiet desperation of  which Thoreau wrote.<br /> And yet there is a spring that runs through us  all. Even when it is dammed up, as Philip Carey's so often is, it can break  out and rush forward, carrying everything in its path. When it happens  deus-ex-machina style in BONDAGE, we are exhilarated (if not convinced).  Maugham lets us down easily. He is too great and generous a writer to leave  us in despair.<br /> Maugham's own story turned out well: he died rich, at  an advanced age, and full of honors.

The next best was Sir Richard F. Burton's THE CITY OF THE SAINTS, about a journey to  see what Mormonism was all about and to meet with Brigham Young.<br /> That  Horace Greeley's book should be third in this line-up is no disgrace. There  is so much self-conscious mythmaking about the Old West that eyewitness  accounts of intelligent observers are as rare as hen's teeth. Before the  completion of the Trans-Continental Railroad, any journey across the Great  Plains was attended by danger, discomfort, and memorable encounters. It is  unfortunate that there so so few good accounts.<br /> Greeley was first and  foremost a newspaper man. He had a sharp eye for what he thought would  interest his readers (unlike Twain &amp; Burton who wrote sub specie  aeternitatis) and did not disappoint. His descriptions of the Indians, the  rigors of the road, and the struggling communities a-borning west of the  Platte make for fascinating reading.<br /> This is one of those great books  to take along on a car journey through the Rockies and Great Plains.	2000-07-14

Books	4	13	13	N	N	An Attractive Map Guide With One Major Flaw	We were returning from Greenwich tired and footsore. The LONDON MAPGUIDE  indicated we could transfer to another bus to Paddington right on Russell  Square. When we alighted, there were no layover stops for the elusive Bus  #7. After tromping for ages around Bloomsbury, we gave up and hiked back  past the British Museum to Oxford Street, where we knew we could get a bus.<br /> The flaw of this and all other map guides to London are the bus routes.  The Underground is fun, but sometimes a bus is more convenient, and, as G.  K. Chesterton wrote, the best way to see London is from the top of a  double-decker bus.<br /> Even London Transport's &quot;Travelling in  London&quot; folder doesn't do justice to the bus system. Granted, it is  diabolically difficult to keep up with route changes, but if someone were  to undertake it and do a more thorough job, the result would be a truly  useful map guide.<br /> But don't let one complaint detract from the value of  this otherwise outstanding guide. Because of the lack of bus information,  most travellers take to the Underground and are quite satisfied with it. I  still recommend THE LONDON MAPGUIDE and still would use it myself, if only  for lack of anything better.	2000-07-09

Nearly everyone can tell you about his scandalous doings with native women, his marriage to an ultra-Catholic Englishwoman, and the latter's destruction of  the author's private papers after his death.<br /> Ever since I read Fawn  Brodie's excellent biography, THE DEVIL DRIVES, I have collected some 20  different Burton books and read most of them. If you make allowances for  Burton's diabolical thoroughness (involved footnotes, appendices, foreign  language quotes, tables, etc.) and his Victorian circumlocutions in dealing  with taboo subjects, he is a truly wonderful read.<br /> Although FIRST  FOOTSTEPS is not his most famous book, it is probably the best one to start  with. The action is not only more focussed, but Burton did feel he needed  quite so much of a scholarly carapace to report back to the scholarly  organizations back in Britain. And it finishes up with a stirring  postscript about an attack on Burton's camp by Somalis in which the author  barely escaped with his life.<br /> Perhaps this is a book that Presidents  Bush and Clinton should have read before committing U.S. troops to the  region: Burton shows us that not much has changed in the region in 150  years. He was in constant danger, and survived only because his knowledge  and guts were more than an a match for his enemies.<br /> This is an exciting  book and deserves to be better known.	2000-07-09

Metro stops, arrondissements, tourist sights are included; the maps are large and bright; the book is  large, but not too large; and yet...<br /> To me, the most important thing a  map guide could do is get me from Point A to Point B without too much  time-wasting confusion in between. Where all the map guides fail is by not  including good bus maps. The Metro is great, but you see only the dark  underside of Paris; whereas a trip along Bus #69 will take you from the  Eiffel Tower past the Louvre and Hotel de Ville through the Marais and  Menilmontant to the Pere Lachaise Cemetery. A comparable trip along the  same route underground would involve one more more of the dread  &quot;correspondances,&quot; which are underground commuter rat races up  and down stairs, ramps, and escalators to distant transfer points.<br /> This  guide actually tries to suggest the different bus routes by including  widely dispersed little red numbers which are impossible to follow closely.  If you really have to use the bus, you'd have to print the &quot;plans de  quartier&quot; and bus routes from the RATP's website .<br />  We had a whole sheaf of these route and quartier maps with us, so we  enjoyed Paris to the utmost, taking the Metro only on Sunday and evenings,  when the bus service winds down.<br /> One additional gripe: It would not  have been terribly difficult to include taxi stations, as the Michelin maps  do.<br /> Despite my criticisms above, the mapguide is excellent, but not  that much better than the other two I mentioned. And I realize it would be  much more difficult to do justice to bus routes (as they are so  changeable), but the opportunity is there to make it a great guide.	2000-07-09

I was charmed by the author's stories and literary  quotes, which not only provided an excellent background to the places we  visited, but also a guide to some of the literature I wanted to read in  conjunction with my travels.<br /> Through Ms. Miers' book, I learned of the  work of the poet Sorley MacLean and the historian Martin Martin, who wrote  a book about the isles of Scotland around 1700 that was instrumental in  persuading Dr. Johnson to set off on his famous journey with Boswell years  later.<br /> I learned that a medieval bishop in Caithness was set upon by an  angry mob and fried in butter for daring to raise taxes on dairy  production.<br /> Although my vacation is now just a memory, his book  remains on my shelf. I liked it as a travel guide, but I loved it as a  source of highland lore connected with some of the most beautiful places I  have ever seen.<br /> Miers is sketchy on accommodation (but she did  recommend some good places) and even more so on restaurants, but I prefer  her book as a keeper. For strong accommodations &amp; restaurants, your  best bet is the Rough Guide to Scotland.	2000-07-08

This great historical writer who had the unique gift of making us see, hear, and feel the heartbeat of times long past, of kings half  forgotten whose reputations were laid to rest often as quickly as they  were.<br /> Robert the Bruce, hero of Bannockburn, was the grandfather of  Robert II by his daughter Marjory, wife of Walter Stewart. The kings from  this union came to be known as the Stewarts, and Robert II and his son  Robert III were two of the weakest. Both, prematurely doddering and  unwilling or unable to wield the power in the kingdom, yielded the real  power to Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife and Menteith. This last Robert is a  character of the type frequently found in Tranter novels: a stern,  unyielding master of realpolitik. (See James Stewart in WARDEN OF THE  QUEEN'S MARCH for a reincarnation.)<br /> The action is seen through the eyes  of the fictional Jamie Douglas, descendent of the famed &quot;Black  Douglas&quot; of Robert the Bruce's day, who tries to help shore up the  monarchy for David, Duke of Rothesay, oldest son of Robert III.<br />  Scottish history can be incredibly murky and involved at times, and that's  what makes it so fascinating. Tranter has a gift for breathing life into  periperal characters and putting them into play across a wide landscape and  over a long period of time.<br /> My favorite subplot involves the notorious  Wolf of Badenoch, who burns down the Cathedral of Elgin, the so-called  Lantern of the North, because of a dispute with its bishop. The Wolf's son,  Alexander , becomes a steadfast friend and ally of Jamie Douglas.<br /> It  was my great fortune to read this trilogy while criss-crossing Scotland. I  would recommend someone new to Tranter starting with the Robert the Bruce  trilogy, but after that, read THE STEWART TRILOGY.	2000-07-02

Although the publisher compares him to Borges, Rushdie, and Garcia Marquez,  what we have in the man from Portugal is a true native original.<br /> We  are introduced to the dusty world of a professional proofreader -- a fussy  type who regrets having two gerunds in his name. I felt as if I were  propelled into MOLLOY or some other of Beckett's novels as the beginning  spiralled around this seemingly unlikely character.<br /> Suddenly,  everything changes. At a critical juncture in a history of the siege of  Lisbon he is proofreading, Silva suddenly introduces a caret and adds the  word &quot;not&quot; -- thus completely changing the history.<br /> His new  boss, a Dr Maria Sara is enchanted by this Bartleby-like act of negation.  She challenges Silva to write a &quot;what if&quot; novel on the  supposition that the history occurred as modified by the &quot;not&quot;:  that the Crusaders, instead of helping the King of Portugal defeat the  Moors, actually sailed on to the Holy Land directly.<br /> Meanwhile, Silva  is clearly becoming enchanted with Maria Sara. What ensues is both the  strangest and most convincing of love stories. Silva writes his book,  brings us into the thick of the history as he imagines the various  characters from the blind muezzin to the German knight to the king himself.  All along, he and Maria are romancing each other through the events of the  siege.<br /> What an incredible ride! Saramago is a master at easing from one  world into another and taking us with him. He is both a master story-teller  and an authentic modern in his handling of a character's state of mind -- a  writer who easily could hold his own in the company of the great writers of  our time.	2000-07-02
US	53092736	R1UIKDJ6ZFQG98	0140443835	45345386	Orkneyinga Saga: The History of the Earls of Orkney (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	50	51	N	N	Where Literature and History Meet in the North Atlantic	There are two ways of reading an Icelandic saga: (1) as a rip-roaring adventure in which people do terrible things to each other and (2) as history involving real events with real people. When I visited the Orkneys  last year, I saw many of the actual locales discussed in the saga: the  Brough of Birsay, where Saint Magnus grew to adulthood; Earl's Bu, the  drinking hall of the earls of the Orkneys; and various places where the  saga's chief villain, Svein Asleifarson, axed or burned his enemies, among  whom were most of those living at the time.<br /> The saga tells of a  200-year stretch of time when the Orkneys -- islands off the northern tip  of Scotland -- owed their allegiance to the Kings of Norway. For the Viking  marauders who ravaged Europe, the Orkneys were a friendly refueling stop on  the inbound and outbound voyages. The earls ruled not only the islands, but  large chunks of the Scottish mainland and most of the Hebrides as well. So  widespread were their lands that they were frequently forced into  power-sharing arrangements with their kinsmen, which then turned into power  struggles to the death. The best instance of this is between the co-earls  and cousins (Saint) Magnus Erlendsson and Hakon Paulsson.<br /> It was common  in those days, if one had a disagreement, to wait until one's enemy was in  his cups; then pile dry rushes against the doors and set them alight. Men,  women, and children escaping the flames were hacked to death by waiting  swordsmen. This happened not once, but several times in the ORKNEYINGA  SAGA. And yet, there is also poetry, craft, and a strange beauty in this  book which make it more than a Grand Guignol with Vikings. Here, on the  bleak northern edges of civilization, the novel was born while our Western  European ancestors were quaking in their boots.<br /> At first, reading an  Icelandic saga is like reading a Russian novel: There are all those long  names that are so similar to one another. The anonymous author of the sagas  couldn't help it: These were their real names.<br /> Today, the men and  deeds set forth in the saga are very much a part of the everyday life of  the Orkneys. It is, therefore, the one book that you must absolutely read  before visiting this remote and fascinating part of Scotland.the sagas  couldn't help it: These were their real names.  <br /> Today, the men and  deeds set forth in the saga are very much a part of the everyday life of  the Orkneys.

All I can say is that this book worked out great.<br /> All the  accommodations at which we stayed were Steves recommendations, and they had  three things in common: They were comfortable, friendly, and reasonably  priced. We paid $60/night in Paris and Amboise; $40/night in Bruges; and  $100/night in our &quot;splurge&quot; stop, Amsterdam. Info on  accommodations has always been a Rick Steves specialty, and he has not  failed us this trip.<br /> I am especially grateful for Rick's recommendation  of the Zuider Zee Museum in Enkhuizen, Holland. Most other guidebooks  either don't mention it or just mention it in passing, but it was one of  the highlights of our trip.<br /> We also used the minibus service Steves  recommends for the Chateaux of the Loire, and as a result had a memorable  time.<br /> Not all guidebooks are good for everyone. Steves economizes by  concentrating only on locales that he likes and only on accommodations in  selected areas (only three neighborhoods in Paris, for example). If you  must stay in Montmartre or Menilmontant in Paris; visit Montpellier and  Clermont-Ferrand; and spend a week in Utrecht or Luxembourg -- then Steves  is not for you. But if you are not the world's most seasoned travel and  want to put together a memorable European vacation, then you could hardly  do better.	2000-06-15

His house on the Rue Raynouard in Paris (which I visited in 1997) was designed to help screen out creditors and, when that failed, to allow the author to  slip out the back entrance on Rue Bertin and make his getaway.<br /> One  result of Balzac's perennial impecuniousness is the controlling role of  money in his books. Even in this novel, ostensibly a study of politics  within a French ministry during the reign of Charles X, the strings are  pulled by two fascinatingly grim money-lenders named Gobseck and Gigonnet.<br /> The obvious choice for the ministry, a brilliant and dedicated politico  named Rabourdin, is painted into a corner and sees his career destroyed by  a legion of lesser men who conspire against him. Perhaps the most telling  criticism that could be made of this otherwise excellent novel is that that  Balzac spends the first 75% of THE BUREAUCRATS introducing approximately a  hundred characters, their wives and relations.<br /> While it is difficult at  times to keep track without a scorecard, Balzac's main theme of  overextended goodness destroyed by well-connected, mealy-mouthed nothings  runs like a river in flood through the pages of THE BUREAUCRATS.<br /> The  book is worth reading if only for the magnificent irony of the ending,  which I will not tell for fear of ruining the surprise. Hang in there for  the finish, and don't get sidetracked by all the characters.	2000-05-23

This is a scholarly life of Francois I, a king about whom Americans know little or nothing, but one that was instrumental in introducing the idea of the grandeur of the French monarchy. Francois lived life to the fullest: he  invaded Italy multiple times (was even captured and held for ransom once),  married twice, had mistresses everywhere, built palaces and castles all  over France -- including Fontainebleau and many of the most famous chateaux  of the Loire.<br /> Therefore, it is a little unfortunate that his biographer  had so little of that life rub off on him. This is Knecht's second stab at  Francois's life, so one would think he could step back a little and marvel  at what this truly remarkable man accomplished in his lifetime. After all,  he brought Leonardo Da Vinci up to live with him at Amboise and allowed one  of the books of Rabelais' PANTAGRUEL to be dedicated to him. Yet Rabelais  and Da Vinci are brought into the book only in passing.<br /> Both Henry  VIII and the Emperor Charles V were somewhat cowed by this monarch, whose  left hand held a sword and right hand, an olive branch.<br /> This is  probably a silly thing to mention, but I feel I would recognize Francois if  he were alive today. Most illustrations of Medieval or Renaissance princes  are more or less interchangeable: Charles the Bold, Richard III, Philip II  of Spain. The portraits of Francois make him look like a real person, as if  he actually had some control about how he was depicted. A little of his  personality comes through in this book, such as in his dealings with artist  Benvenuto Cellini -- but what a personality!<br /> Knecht may not be a great  biographer like Duff Cooper (Talleyrand) or Richard Holmes (Coleridge), but  he did succeed in bringing something of the essence of this great king  across.	2000-05-16

To this end, his guides are more PRESCRIPTIVE than DESCRIPTIVE.<br /> For a good DESCRIPTIVE guide, I would turn to another guide such as  Lonely Planet or Rough Guide, supplemented, perhaps, by Rachel Kaplan's  excellent &quot;Little-Known Museums In and Around Paris.&quot;<br /> A  PRESCRIPTIVE guide like this will urge that you avoid the Madeleine, Opera  Garnier, and Pantheon because they aren't worth it -- and don't bother with  the Bastille, because it was torn down over 200 years ago. Steves  concentrates on accommodations and restaurants in only three parts of  Paris: Rue Cler (near the Eiffel Tower), the Marais, and the Rue Mouffetard  area. That saves perhaps a hundred pages and makes the book more compact  and easy to carry during a trip.<br /> One of the strong points of the book  is the merging of material from Steves' useful &quot;Mona Winks&quot; art  guide into his Paris book. &quot;Mona Winks&quot; shows how you can visit  the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, the Cluny Museum (highly recommended), and  Versailles without killing yourself. For the Louvre, as an example, he  concentrates how you can devote your attention to parts of the Sully and  Denon wings and see the key works in about 2-3 hours. (Okay, if you're a  purist, don't flame me: You and I would, of course, devote more time -- but  that's not the issue here.)<br /> For the most complete info on Paris, I  would suggest you supplement Steves with two fantastic Internet resources:  the postings on the rec.travel.europe newsgroup (especially by JACK), and  the website of the RATP (which runs the Metro and buses in Paris) at  [...]in Paris) at  [...]	2000-05-15

They had a very definite goal in mind: To let you enjoy Europe for $XX dollars a day. Their books were fun and informative; but  somewhere along the line, the Frommer people lost touch with their  leadership.<br /> When you try to write a book for everybody, you wind up  writing for nobody. Let us take accommodations as an example: They are  classified as Expensive, Moderate, and Inexpensive. Now I am not on public  assistance by any means, yet I can barely afford Frommer's Inexpensive  accommodations, which average around more than $100 a night.<br /> There are  guidebooks which are good at accommodations and restaurants but not on  sights; and there are others (like the superb DK Eyewitness Guides) which  concentrate on the sights. I am hard put to place Frommer on this spectrum.  In the Netherlands, he downplays the Zuider Zee Museum in Enkhuizen and the  Open Air Museum in Arnhem, yet spends 3 chapters on Luxembourg, including  one on &quot;Planning a Trip to Luxembourg.&quot; Hello! When was the last  time you got the wife and kiddies mobilized for a fun filled 3 week  vacation in the tiny Duchy of Luxembourg?<br /> On the plus side, the  &quot;Best of...&quot; lists are a useful counter to the general lack of  emphasis in this guidebook.<br /> If you were visiting the U.S., you would  want a guidebook to show you why you might want to spend more time in New  York than Youngstown. Once the best of guidebook series, Frommer has been  reduced to cataloguing sights. Where's the excitement? Not here.	2000-05-13

I have used other guidebooks before: Frommer, Let's Go, Rough Guides, and Lonely Planet. While I admire the detail in the latter  two series, I trust Steves only in two important areas:<br /> (1) Trustworthy  accommodations recommendations (he and his people really do check out the  places he recommends) and<br /> (2) Useful training in the practical  &quot;how to&quot; aspects of travel, such as how to phone home without  using your overpriced American telephone credit card and how to take trains  and other public transportation. The man is a serious educator: witness his  entertaining PBS TV series. He is willing to make himself look like a dork  to make you enjoy European travel.<br /> On the negative side, Steves'  restaurant recommendations are sparse and uadventurous (though this is an  area in which no one excels). Also, in selling the areas in which he is  most interested, he leaves out large areas of the British Isles (especially  in Scotland, where the omission of Glasgow and the Orkneys may take some  explaining).<br /> In the rec.travel.europe newsgroup, Steves has legions of  detractors and defenders. Mere mention of his name sets off knee-jerk  flaming responses from people who do not understand him.<br /> The simple  fact is this: If you follow his recommendations --particularly if you are  relatively new to European travel -- you are likely to have a better time.  Why? The man is not afraid to be prescriptive (instead of largely  descriptive like Lonely Planet). Also, you are not likely to waste as much  money, because you will weight your trip more on the side of small towns  than large cities.	2000-05-07

Rachel Kaplan's engaging little book is a fascinating guide to some of the many museums in and around Paris that do NOT make it into the big guidebooks. Everyone has heard of the Louvre, the Orsay, even the Musee  Rodin, but what about the others? Some of them are small museums run by  devoted individuals; at least one (the Musee de la Marine in the Trocadero  complex) is, I believe, run by the French government.<br /> This is a book  badly in need of updating. Three years ago, when I used to to visit the  Maison de Balzac on Rue Raynouard, the information on transportation,  hours, and addresses was of relatively recent vintage and, consequently,  more trustworthy.<br /> While Kaplan's contributions are wonderful and the  many black and white and color photographs memorable, the publisher did a  very mediocre job of presentation. I do not care for the book's alphabetic  orientation and deplore the unhelpful single map.<br /> One more negative:  There are many other small museums in Paris that are not even mentioned in  passing, such as the Musee de la Serrure (locks, keys, and door knockers);  Musee de la Poste (mail service); Musee Guimet (Oriental art); the new  museum of Jewish history near the Pompidou Center -- to mention just a few.<br /> And yet, I look forward in a couple of weeks to visiting the Musee  Delacroix and the Musee Cognac-Jay, neither of which appear in my other  guidebooks. This is a very useful book for those who wish to explore  lesser-known parts of the City of Lights. I look forward to a new edition  which will make it even more useful.	2000-05-07

I asked  him, &quot;Are you George Mackay Brown?&quot; He smiled, answered, &quot;I  do not deny it,&quot; and walked on with his hands in his pockets.<br />Now  that I have read several of his books and am continually scouring the world  for more, I see this as one of the great missed opportunities of my  life.<br />Who was Magnus? Saint Magnus was one of the great Earls of Orkney  in the time when the Isles owed their fealty to the Kings of Norway. Those  Viking raids that so terrified Europe all stopped off at Orkney for  provisions before going off to pillage the Southrons. Into this maelstrom  came a saintly Viking (if that isn't an oxymoron!) named Magnus, who was  forced to share power with one of his kinsmen. The latter decided to grab  it all, and had Magnus butchered under a flag of truce.<br />Brown takes  episodes in Magnus's life and holds them up in the light to see how it  reflects off their surfaces. In Magnus's death, he sees Auschwitz in one  famous scene which many critics have disliked, but which I thought was  brilliant. Somehow, it took a fellow Orcadian to see Magnus to his core;  and Brown does it with majesty, lyricism, and love.<br />In Kirkwall stands  the 12th Century cathedral of St Magnus. I am not sure but that George  Mackay Brown, that wild lonely man, built a greater one in this book.	2000-03-11

In this country, we tend to be fixated on the art of  England, France, and Italy, with a few side-trips to Germany, Russia, and  the Orient. Before Schama, I thought of the Netherlands as an  &quot;auxiliary&quot; country with no particular vision of its own.<br />  I  am delighted to have been proven wrong. THE EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES carries  its theme like a mighty wave through hundreds of pages that read like a  short essay. Here is this little country retrieved largely from the sea and  mud, surrounded by powerful enemies who have repeatedly invaded and savaged  it, and yet prevailing in its gentle and remarkably tolerant essence over  the centuries. One does not survive this level of pain as a people unless  one learns the lessons of cooperation, of tolerance, and of humor.<br />  Several weeks ago, I found myself in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  My attention was riveted by a still life of cut-up fruit and seafood that I  had seen before, but never stopped to examine. This time I did and looked  more closely. Swarming or buzzing over the food were a small army of ants  and other insects. The painters of the Golden Age were trying to teach us a  lesson, gently, of the transitoriness of all that is good and beautiful.  Life is good now, but the waters and the nations are building up for  another assault.	2000-03-11

This one is no exception. After introductory chapters on early trends in Roman and Celtic  monasticism, she launches into two jewel-like portraits -- of St Benedict  of Nursia, founder of the Benedictine Order, and St Gregory the Great, a  monk turned pope.<br />Duckett's Dark Ages are illuminated with the warmth of  her monk-saints who strove to protect their fledgeling communities in the  face of turmoil and rapine. At the same time, they sought to burnish their  souls so that they would be pleasing to the all-merciful God who cast so  much adversity their way.<br />Yet these spiritual heroes just tightened  their belts and leaned ever harder into the wind. The simple things that we  have lost!	1998-11-19

WARDEN OF  THE QUEEN'S MARCH was the first Tranter I read, and it moved me to run out  and buy everything of his I could find in print.<br />Tranter's novel tells  the story of Mary Queen of Scots' reign from the point of view of a young  Border lord, Thomas Ferniehill of Smailholm (or &quot;Smellum&quot; as the  Queen calls him), who is passionately devoted to the Queen and is involved  in several key junctures of her tragic reign. I believe that very few of  the characters have been invented for the sake of narrative, and Tranter's  depictions of James Stewart, Earl of Moray, and of the preacher John Knox  are articularly memorable.<br />The book covers the entire reign up to the  start of Mary's captivity in England. Darnley, Bothwell, Rizzio, the  &quot;Four Marys,&quot; Kircaldy, and all the greats (as well as the  infamous) of Scotland during that troubled time make their appearance. And  the character of Ferniehill makes an admirable filter for all the high  melodrama of the times.	1998-10-17

Sadly, like many of the excellent Dover mystery series, it is out of print for now. A widely disliked don is found shot through the head in a colleague's rooms, and it becomes a process of elimination to find the culprit. A visiting professor from Vienna by the name of Alfred Brendel acts as a sleuth who discovers the culprit. This is a book whose atmospherics far outweigh the plot. As a mystery, it's a 5; but as a cultural artifact, it's a 10.	1998-04-29

Angered by the marauding ways of the MacDonalds of Glencoe, the King (William of Orange) and his ministers -- most notably the Master of Stair -- draft orders for their murder.<br /> The Argyle regiment is sent to Glencoe and asks to be quartered with the MacDonalds. After two weeks of accepting the sacred hospitality of the highlanders, the troops wait for the signal and butcher their hosts. A wry &quot;coda&quot; describes how all the English and Scots politicos, from the King on down, tried to wriggle out of the responsibility for the massacre.<br /> Prebble's Scottish histories are unfortunately out of print now. GLENCOE, as well as CULLODEN and THE HIGHLAND CLEARANCES, are superbly written and a necessity for any tourist visiting Scotland who wants to understand the historical background.	1998-04-22

Sounds like Ron Reagan's &quot;Morning in America,&quot; doesn't it? Except it is Victorian London. The entreprenour is Auguste Melmotte. The yuppies are the scions of great and small families hurling themselves at his daughter, his phantasmagorical railway (between Salt Lake City and Vera Cruz yet!) company, and the hem of his cloak. And the book is Anthony Trollope's THE WAY WE LIVE NOW.<br /> Like all of Trollope's books, this one is as well crafted as any by Eliot or Thackeray; yet the theme and handling are strikingly modern. I came to this book by way of the Barsetshire novels with their depiction of rural clergy. I should have read THE WAY WE LIVE NOW first.<br /> Especially worth noting are the surprisingly full characterizations of Marie Melmotte, daughter of the financier, who is courted by her emotional inferiors, and Roger Carbury, a rural landowner who holds aloof from the fray and helps several of the others pick up the pieces from their lives.<br /> The only negative is the book's anti-semitism, though it makes several attempts to lift itself from this charge.	1998-04-11

Local wheeler-dealers in a West Florida town devise a residential development that involves filling in a beautiful bay, to the dismay of the town's conservationists. Jimmy Wing, newspaperman, professes to help both camps, but is really in it only for the chance the view the &quot;mechanism&quot; of the conflict at close quarters. In the end, everyone emerges a loser; and Wing finds he has won a pyrrhic victory over his detachment from humanity. In this book, MacDonald probably brushes uncomfortably close to his real persona.	1997-11-25

How can a novel written over 30 years ago speak to us so directly without reference to its era?<br /> In BRIGHT ORANGE FOR THE SHROUD, knight errant McGee rights wrongs committed by an impromptu consortium which exists to defraud and destroy its victim utterly. McGee flushes out the book's ultra-villain, Boo Waxwell, and does what he can to rectify the wrongs done to an innocent man. All, I might add, without reference to the Cold War, Carnaby Street, Hippies, or anything else which would have identified the book as a product of the Sizties.<br /> MacDonald's villains are the seven deadly sins, with an occasional personification of evil from the swamps like rapist-murderer-extortionist Waxwell thrown in. A wonderful read which I highly recommend.	1997-09-28

And from consummated lust to consummated murder is an equally short jump. It is the ironic unfolding of the consequences in which Cain unhooks the direct causality from crime and its punishment that the actors in the drama become pawns in a larger game in which their actions are irrelevant.<br /> Made into 3 excellent films (including Michelangelo Antonioni's IL GRIDO), POSTMAN has never lost its ability to shock.	1997-09-28

Virtually every page is a food fight of the senses, with pages of sensuous descriptions of every manner of food known to France.<br /><br />Set in Napoleon III's Paris, shortly after the giant Les Halles market was built on the Right Bank (it is now a giant sunken shopping mall near the Pompidou Center), THE BELLY OF PARIS is the story of an escapee from the French penal colony in Cayenne who lives with his brother, a pork butcher, and becomes a seafood inspector. In the process, he becomes a target for the discontents of the gossipy food merchants who are resentful of his left-leaning ways. He and his friends foment a pathetic attempt at a revolution that mirrors what was to become the Paris Commune years later. This is one of the early volumes in Zola's monumental Rougon-Macquart series.	1997-05-04
