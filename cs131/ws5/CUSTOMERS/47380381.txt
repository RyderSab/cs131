I like the title The Glory Bus better....Anyway this is a good send off for Richard Laymon, who I have loved some of his books and some of his books....well let's just say I could have lived without them. <br />As the years go by I miss him more and more....Everything I have read about him he seemed like a nice guy, who at times could be the most creative voice in horror. Anyway, back to <br />Into the Fire or The Glory Bus....This is a good Laymon book. <br />Not his best...But good....I would say in the upper 1/3 of his writings...and that's not half bad...	2005-10-02

It certainly opens up the opportunity to obtain great hard boiled detective fiction from the past and the present. This book is not really a detective story, it is more of an adventure story with a hero that could have been a hard boiled detective. The formula is simple: a fortune in buried treasure and a bunch of characters that no one should trust. The author seems to want us to learn the Spanish language while we read this book. There are a lot times that he tells what something is and then gives us the Spanish word to go along with it. <br />Good story. Good pace.	2005-06-29

There is still some of the old James Patterson magic, but this comes across as almost a parody of Patterson's work. Wolf and Weasel come across as more like  <br />villains from a James Bond book.

Nick Morrelli is either the most realistic small town sheriff in fiction or he is the dumbest. For an ex-football player he sure got beat up a lot. No one was arrested for assaulting an officer.

Mr. Wright fails to tie up all the loose ends (almost like there may be a sequel) and leaves the reader hanging.I like the P.I. aspects of the book and the humor.

With less than 500 population Eternity had several restaurants/night clubs, resorts, stores, an asylum etc.....My wife's aunt lives in a town of 500 population and all they have is a BP station.	2001-04-17
