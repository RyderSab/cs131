I found both Amy and Luke boring, and I kept waiting for some startling revelation-which never came. Needless to say, I'm not interested in reading the first books in the series.	2004-03-09

I listen to Jennifer Cruise's books on unabridged audiocassettes because there aren't many choices for romances in this area.  Jennifer Cruise's books have never been all that great to me.<br />  This one came as a big surprise.  I actually liked the female character, there wasn't a sex scene every 20 pages, the story was cute, and  the female character wasn't a thin, long-legged Barbie type.	2004-03-04
US	52783681	RD1Q6ZE5GF9ID	0440241197	894874279	Small Wonders	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Her best Bethlehem book	I recently started reading the Bethlehem series and, even though I'm a romantic suspense person, I'm hooked.  I have enjoyed all of her books except for the endings.  Her books fall in this pattern-the main characters fall in love, one of them needs to be forgiven for some indiscretion he/she neglected to tell the other, the other character cannot forgive the person, and an angel dramatically changes the mind of the character  in the last 5 pages. Bang -end of story.<br />Her latest book, &quot;Small Wonders&quot;  began with everyone knowing most  of Cole's problems.  The book dealt with self discovery, the ability to change, and being able to forgive yourself.<br />The secondary story of Melissa and Alex was also wonderful.  As a Special Ed teacher I felt especially appreciative of how this story was handled.  I wish more people were so easily accepting.<br />I thorougly enjoyed the whole book.  Oh, and the angels were still there, but the characters were given litlle nudges throughout the book, not a mind altering nudge at the end.	2003-12-30

I don't know Susan Donovan- so I was surprised to read a fun story with enjoyable characters and a touch of mystery.  <br />On top of being a very enjoyable book, the main character was not a Perfect Stepford clone.  I am really tired of females characters who are beauty pageant perfect, have a photographic memory, etc...When so many stories lately have perfect characters-it was refreshing to read about a self proclaimed &quot;spaz&quot;.	2003-11-10

I enjoyed the male Cynster books, even though they were  skimpy on plot as well.  This had very little to entice the reader.  Amelia proposed to Lucien.  He accepted... The End-right? No, this was the beginning. The only thing left was the seduction, the seduction, the seduction...on both sides.	2003-10-25

Ms. Hooper seemed to be in a hurry.<BR> She wanted to remind you of a relationship with Max and his wife, introduce Morgan and Quinn, and develop and complete a romance with Wolfe and Storm. <BR> Because Ms. Hooper was trying to do so much, the plot seemed hurried and the characters incomplete. I  felt like I was missing part of the story.	2003-06-26

The story plot flowed evenly, the characters were consistent, and it was  fun.  Then Ms. Dodd wanted to finish the story. She changed Zack's personality, developed ridiculous scenes, and added new plots for future stories with a vengeance.  It was not a pretty sight.	2003-06-23

I usually like Suzanne Brockmann's books because of the interwoven stories. Not this one!<BR>1. I did not like the two main characters. Both seemed to need maturing.<BR>2. Sam really was irritating- when he was in the story.<BR>3. The WW2 addition to her story was unexciting, and I was glad there was very little of it. <BR>4. The plot was slow.<BR>Surprisingly, the character I did like was Marylou.  I hope she comes to a happy ending in the next story.	2003-02-12

I also did not like last year's Iris Johansen novel. However, this book is excellent!  The characters are consistent with the previous books, Galen continues to be an interesting character, and Jane remains a '12 year old child going on 50'. I would like a future novel with Galen as the male lead.	2002-07-13

Books 5, 6, and 7 were reruns of the previous four.   <br />This one was still funny, but not to the point of nausea. The relationship between Joe, Ranger(who I am not a fan of), and Stephanie seemed a little more defined... although Stephanie still doesn't seem to know who or what she wants.  Stephanie comments in this novel that 'somewhere along the line Joe has grown up'.  Will Stephanie-or will that destroy the story?	2002-07-07
