It's a very sweet story in which a polar bear cub asks where he came from. Mama tells him Gos gave us you. She tells the cub that God decided he belonged with her and Papa. I nearly cried reading this book, thinking how it answered the question just as I would want to if my child asked me where he came from.	2005-10-13

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I am not striving for a \\"natural\\" delivery. This book is not just for those women who choose to labor without the assistance of pain medication. It gives you great exercises to make you feel great during pregnancy and prepare your body for birth. Medication or no, you will still have to do the work and you will still feel pain. It discusses nutrition, parental bonding, what to do after the birth, and more. You want relaxation techniques even if you want an epidural. This book covers it all. I think it's the best book available on the subject, and I've gotten a bunch out of the library. This was the only book good enough to buy.	2005-09-06

They are all light-hearted and full of wonderful and entertaining characters. The books follow Sam, a pastor in a small-town Quaker church, and the eclectic group of individuals who are members.  <br /> <br />That being said, this was my least favorite of the series. I fear Gulley is runnung low on humor! This one was very pleasent and feel-good, but was not quite as funny as the previous ones. Also, one of the things I love about these books are the touching one or two-liners he usually ends the chapters with. They just warm your heart! But this book didn't have those.  <br /> <br />Either way, these books are easy, pleasant and clean reads. Enjoy!	2005-07-25

The author does not seem to fully understand some Catholic traditions, such as genuflecting in the presense of the Eucharist, and also has a shaky understanding of dogma and doctrine. It is not for the Catholic to decide what doctine to accept and not accept; by professing your Catholic faith, you profess to believe everything the Church teaches. This slips by this book. They also makes their biases known with their language on topics such as abortion.  <br /> <br />Many people will read a book and accept what is in it as fact; I hope no one does that with this book. Please read Catholicism for Dummies. It is written by Catholic priests who understand doctrine and practices, agree with them, and present them truthfully.	2005-07-25

It's great for just about anyone, rather cradle Catholic looking to learn a little more or non-Catholic unfamiliar with the faith. I read it around the time of the election of Pope Benedict, and I learned a great deal about the heirarchy. I also thought other sections, such as the one on the vestments, were interesting. These are things Catholics don't learn much about because they are not of major consequence. But don't let that fool you - there is plenty of important information in this book. A great summary of Catholic beliefs! <br /> <br />Stay away from Idiots Guide to Catholicism and get this book instead. :)	2005-07-25

The whole book talks about the baby bunny running away from mommy bunny, while mommy bunny keeps saying I'll just find you! I would fear it would give young children the idea of running away in a supermarket, department store, or even in the neighborhood! It just isn't a pleasent story, hearing about a baby bunny who wants nothing but to run away, but in the end is so depressed at his lack of ability to run away from mommy he just gives in and stays home.  <br />	2005-06-30

This book is great for any marriage, including good marriages. My husband and I have a solid, stable marriage, but it can always be better and more faith-filled. This book provides a great foundation for creating a great marriage. It discusses bringing Jesus into your marriage and how to be Christ to your partner; how to be a loving mate even when you don't feel like it; what the different \\"love-languages\\" are, and more.  <br /> <br />This book does mention Catholicism is a few sections, but overall, it is more geared toward any practicing Christian.

I love Ann Coulter, and this book just made me love her even more. This is a collection of her columns are articles, some never before published. She is such a talented writer and so funny! More than once I got funny looks from my fellow bus travelers while trying to stifle a laugh.     Ann Coulter doesn't write anything that can't be documented; it is a fact that there are hords of liberals waiting for her to make a mistake so they can pounce. So ignore all those reviews from people who haven't even read the book and just don't agree with her politics. This is one of the most entertaining and informative books I've read.	2004-12-18

I found this book to have too many sexual references for a girl any younger than 14, and even then I don't think I would want my daughter reading it. One of the girls decided to persue her much older soccer coach, for example. The lessons of friendship and self-esteem are great, but there were too many inappropriate references for a young girl, and by the time they were old enough, say 14 or 15, the book would no longer be interesting to them.	2004-12-12

They do add/delete/change recipes from one edition to the next. For example, my favorite fudge recipe is altered from the 11th edition to the 12th. And, the recipes are organized by category within category in the 12th; for example, cookies are orgazined in that chapter's table of contents by bar cookies, drop cookies, etc. In the 11th, everything within each subject category is alphabetical. That may not seem like a big deal, but once you are used to that, it's a little weird to go to the 12 edition and have to get used to the change. But overall, I love BHG for the basic rules and guidelines. This cookbook (all editions) is great for both the experienced cook and the absolute beginner. Find eggs benedict and boiled eggs in the same book.	2004-12-07

I found this book to be a refreshing change from the barrage of books available on how to be supermom, how to balance a career and a family and everything else, or how to not let your children get in the way of your life. This isn't a self-help book or a personal account, but more on the lines of a sociology book on the current aspects of motherhood. It addresses the modern-day feminist needs to \\"have it all\\". My favorite chapters were those dealing with women's desires to stay home with or be the primary figure in their children's lives, and how they have to contend with society telling them that they are unintelligent because they do not have careers or weak because they cannot or do not want to leave their children in daycare all day.     This book does NOT attack the non-traditional, modern-day mom. It DOES support the traditional family, letting women know there is nothing wrong with the desire to be a mom.	2004-11-01

I went into this book thinking it would be interesting and maybe give me a look at what motherhood is like for others. I hope not all women feel this way or we will have a world of screwed up children. She complains incessantly about the distribution of labor and the costs of caring for young children, as though it is just an unpleasant by-product of motherhood rather than one of the wonderful aspects of it. She also seems to be a bit loony, discussing her radical past, like trips to concerts with \\"warlocks\\" and her 6-month juice only diet. It also doesn't take her long to get her dig in on pro-life people, saying they want to punish women for having sex.  <br /> <br />I would pass up this book, and maybe read Maternal Desire: On Children, Love, and the Inner Life instead.  <br />	2004-11-01

But, they are mostly ideas that would require major remodeling, would be impossible, or would only be helpful when designing your blue prints. There are decorating ideas, but overall, this book is geared more toward the architect. An example is an in-the-wall loft, and another is a split level bedroom. Also, the rooms are rarely your average square bedroom but instead have very creative floor plans. SO- the book is creative and attractive, but not very useful.	2004-10-14

I think it is very well written, and expresses many of the feelings I was ashamed and embarrassed to express, or didn't really realize were there. I really thought I was rare in the fact that I have very few female friends beyond work acquaintances, and in the fact that I long for that to change, but am too shy to do much about it. When we are kids, making friends is easy. What about those women working from home, or living in rural areas? If all the people you come in to contact with in an average day are the check-out lady and the bank teller, what's a woman to do? It gives some tidbits and ideas for making new friends, talks a good bit about the importance of female companionship to our well-being, along with info on things like how to know if you should cut a friend loose and what to do when your child's friend is no longer friends with someone who's mother you had become close with (that was wordy, I know). Anyway, I think this is a unique book worth reading. Those who give it just a star or two probably do so because they have many friends and therefore cannot relate to the content.	2004-09-03
