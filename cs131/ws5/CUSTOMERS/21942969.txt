Spanish Holiday was a book I picked from the book store due to curiosity.  The book reminded me of Havana Nights;Dirty Dancing for some reason, so I had to get it.  I started reading the book and was disapointed due to the style in which the book was written.  I thought the author was a beginner writer.  The book was filled mainly of dialuage, but once I got used to it, I enjoyed the book. <br />A group of friends arrive in Spain.  Tom is an angry person who's quite self stuck on him.  Tom and his girlfriend Ruth spend a lot of closeness together, not scared of showing their affection for one another.  Yaz and Laura travel without a companion, but are very anxious to get to meet some opposite sex hotties. <br />The group travels and experiances hotel problems, car black outs and much more.  Soon, they are offered to stay and watch over a villa.  Tom is pretty angry about this, for he wants to travel more south to see more of the country.  Laura pleads him to check out the house.  The four drive to the house with Tom cussing because he can't find it.  Finally, they find the beautiful house and all pick rooms for the time being. <br />Laura is the most adventorous and loves exploring.  She takes the transportation bus and travels into the city.  SHe finds her own job teaching English.  Laura seems to be having the most fun here in the house.  The four meet a lad named Juan and he takes them out to night clubs and to other places.  <br />Yaz soon falls for Juan and becomes enlightenly obsessed with him.  Juan fixes up the pool in the house and Yaz follows him, talks to him, and fluants him with her body. <br />The two lovebirds; Tom and Ruth soon grow sick of the house and leave to go down south.  Now, the two girls Laura and Yaz are left alone in the house to themself.  <br />Juan soon speaks his feelings and tells Laura that he really likes her and not Yaz.  What will happen to Yaz now that her heart is broken?  How will Laura's relationship process with Juan.  Whatwill happen to Tom and Ruth?  Will they ever come back?  So many questions to be answered, but I musn't spoil this for you. <br />I enjoyed the book, it definately got better in the middle and it's a sweet Spanish romance that any young reader would swoon over.  Just picture what Juan would look like...and drool comes out.  I enjoyed this book, so I hope you would too.	2004-05-16

I thought the front cover was weird, but continued starting the first period, and fell in love with it.  Francis is stuck with a girls name and finds himself eyeing a girl Margie at church.  <br />The coming of age novel shows Francis and his gangy group and how they survive through a lot of their firsts through adolescent times.  They grew up in a Catholic school <br />Margie has previous thoughts on sucide especially because some things that happened between her and her brother.  I thought Margie was a bit weird, but I'm glad she got Francis to help her out with her problems. <br />Other problems are faced through this book from family problems, fighting in the house, racism, sex, drugs, and death.  The book is set for anyone of any age really, but I'm not a sucker for coming to age tales.  I find my personality and life a whole lot different (basically on a different side) as these boys.  However, I did like this book better then Perks of Being a Wallflower and a couple other books that are in the same category.<br />Pick the book up if you can, don't be fooled by the title or cover.  I plan to see if the movie is in stock, because it might be interesting to get caught up in the movie.  The book will make you laugh, even though there are many sad parts, especially at the end.	2004-05-09

I'm a younger reader, probably too young to understand the material and feel the feelings the writer was protraying.  The book was extremely slow for me from the beginning to the end.  A single mother grieves and gets through every day with a grudge, supporting three children.  Venita's boyfriend David is gone which makes things worse.  She calls him and e-mails him to keep in touch, but the feeling isn't the same. <br />Venitia goes through the troubles of raising her three kids.  She has to take them to church, deal with car problems, raise The Beauty, deal with her mother and occuring weddings.  <br />Lonely as ever, Venitia does get to meet a man Hedley.  He asks her to marry him and she agrees.  The thing is, her heart has been given to David.  She does not truly love Hedley with her heart and soul, and soon with help she realizes the man who she's destined to be with. <br />The book was set in a depressed mood which made it boring to read.  Definately not a fun read.	2004-05-08

I started reading it, and got extremely bored.  But, it didn't stop me.  I read on to learn that Ursula (ugly girl) was a lot like me in various ways.  I had a keen love for basketball, and so did she.  She always tried her best in basketball, but sometimes it wasn't enough.  Her parents didn't come watch her games; they didn't really care.  <br />The book switches sides and introduces you to Matt.  Matt is a friendly guy who is the \\"Big Mouth\\" in reference to the title.  Matt makes a joke that he's going to blow up the school, which is overheard, and a dispute calls out.  Matt is in serious trouble, not only with his higher school authorities, but the police.  <br />Matt is well-liked, popular and interestingly funny.  Ursula is...well ugly.  Urusula stands up for Matt, which surprises him, because he hasn't ever talked to Urusula.  He tries sending her e-mails, chickens out a lot, but soon befriends Urusula.  <br />Urusula's parents tell her to stay away from Matt.  They stereotype him as a \\"Bad, horrible\\" kid, not knowing that his mis doings were unintentional.  Urusula and Matt start hanging out together more and more.  Matt's life is turned upside down, and Urusula helps him through the horible times.  <br />I believe anyone would enjoy this short story.  The book is so simple, but it rewards you with so much more.	2004-04-24

It was different from any other book I've read.  Anna decides to move out to Hollywood to spend some time with her father.  On the plane ride to California, she meets a boy named Ben.  They start off in a steamy relationship while on the plane, making out and getting jiggy with it.  <br />When Anna arrives, she realizes she has the man everyone wants.  A bunch of prissy teenagers loathe Anna when she comes with Ben to the \\"Event of the Year\\"  Anna is a well behaved darling young lady, with a vast personality unlike the other girls.  <br />The other girls are cruel and mean.  They invite her to help out the needy to find gossip about her and Ben.  They rip her dress open, embarrassing her to the max.  A typical greedy teenage setting, yet this book says it well.  <br />Anna does something in the end, that I was surprised.  She stands up for what she thinks is best, throwing her heart on the floor.  She talks to her dad, sorts things out, and tries to save their relationship.  Anna is a remarkable character. <br />I really enjoyed this book, mainly because it was far fetched and so very fictional.  Reading about Gucci purses and expensive DKNY shoes was very interesting.  I had fun reading this book.  Everyone should read it!	2004-04-24

Through the ruckus and disgusting parts, I became fond of the novel.<br />It was a little slow in parts, I must admit, but cleverly entertaining.<br />Harry Driscoll leaves a stale life.  He regrets some things he does and we all can see why.  Harry went to an IVY League school, decided not to pursue a career in law, and became an editor living in a cubicle throughout the day.<br />He hates his job life, makes meager portions, and struggles to survive.  He lives in a scanty sized apartment and is so low on food, that he forces to eat daily condiments from resteraunts.<br />The greatest thing in Harry's life is his girl, Evie.  Evie means the world to him, even though he can't tell her so.  The disgusting parts in the novel are those discussing of Evie's &quot;Health Problems&quot;  Any man who stays with a girl through that really has to love her. <br />Through the cannon balls, the parties, and the cheating on Evie, things get discombobulated.  Harry definatly is a typical man.  He loses the things he loves most.  And, it makes me feel sorry for Harry, but he did learn his lesson in the end.<br />I suggest this novel to anyone.  It's a quick read with catchy chapter titles, and extreme vocabulary.  True story?  I have to believe some parts.  Yay for it any whos!	2004-04-11

She's into baseball and not-so-into pies.  She bakes a pie for the pie contest because her parents pursuade her to.  The book continues on with Roxanne growing each chapter.  Soon, she's found a boyfriend a year younger than her who she celebrates many &quot;firsts&quot; with.  Her mother and father have a new baby which leaves Roxanne in surprise.  <br />Roxanne continues to grow older, goes to college, comes back to visit her cousin who has lost his arm in the war.  She has a strong bond with her cousin; lets just leave it clean and at that.  <br />Roxanne gets married, has a lovely wedding in her small hometown.  She gets homesick of being in the populated busy state, and yearns to live in the cracker country of home.  Places such as Carl's Corsets (her father's lingerie store) and the Cafe just wouldn't be the same.  <br />I really enjoyed this book; it gave me happy little feelings inside.  I reccomend this quick read to anyone of any age.  It will make you smile, remember on the good innocent years, and laugh.	2004-04-11

Jessica dwells on her \\"virgin\\" status and is a tad bit weary that she'll stay a virgin throughout high school.  The book explains of the many hookups at Jessica's school.  Most disgust Jessica, until she finds one of her own.  Her old crush from elementary school, who was known as a dork totally transfered into a hot stud who took many by surprise.  Jessica thought Len was a stranger, but in fact he was the dorky brainac that was her competition for valevictorian.  They hook up, but the charisma between the two is slim.  Len proclaims he wants to save his virginity until marriage.  Len soon breaks up with the wild Jessica.  Jessica takes ectasy, which Len tells his mother, and Len's mother tells him that Jessica is a bad influence.  He breaks up with her on Valentines day which leaves Jessica at her biggest low.

She sneaks an application and awaits for the acceptance letter.  Jessica gets accepted to every college she applied, but what one will she end up going to?  She also experiances death, more boy problems, and normal teenage quirks.  I suggest anyone to read this humorous coming to age tale of a fictional brilliant girl who skips prom to make out with her true love, sneaks out on runs at night to beat her insomnia, and has to live with her pregnant stingy sister Bethany.  A must read, and favorite, but be sure to pick up Sloppy Firsts before this.	2004-03-27

People start wondering why Jessica doesn't have a boyfriend, and why she is one of the only virgin's in the school.  She holds a crush on the gorgous Paul, and has a odd experiance with him when she gets drunk. <br />Jessica has to deal with the whole peeing in Marcus' cup experiance, which is quite humorous, and far fetched.  <br />The author's style is beautiful, the book will make you laugh out loud.  After reading a couple bad books in a row, I was finally satisfied after I read Sloppy Firsts.  I can't wait to read the sequel to this.  I'm sure it will be as cute and Sloppy as the first.	2004-02-29

I read this book, feeling that it would captivate my mind.  The girl gets a boyfriend, Robin, who contacts her sexually.  The girl seems stupid to let this boy, whom she states she doesn't even like finger her and what not.  The two soon break up.  The girl deals with friend problems.  Her friend states that she ignores her too frequently for boys.  <br />The girl's father turns violent through the book, verbally.  He has a very rigid personality, that turned back his wife and children.  He drinks, and what not.  <br />The girl soon meets a man Oliver, who says to be 27.  The girl is only 14, and doen't seem to think that this is a problem.  She sleeps with Oliver, loses her virginity, thinks nothing of it, and he ends up lying of his age.  Oliver beats her, and abuses her to get into her body for sex. <br />I thought this book was disgusting, and I could not relate to anything.  The girl was oblivious, I just wanted to slap her and tell that she was crazy.  The mom was stupid too, making lies to make her daughter feel better about going out with a old man. <br />The book faces every problem imaginable from sex to drinking.  It's written at a slow pace, and a little to long for words.  The ending was action packed compared to the steady speed that the book had at the beginning.  The end was a bit harsh, and ended weird, but I liked it.  <br />The book was written well, by a sixteen year old who dropped out of school.  I feel bad for this girl, because obviously she has a lot of problems going through in her life.  <br />The book also gives bad images into elders minds about teenage girls.  We are not all like that, and I am far from it.  It was kind of disturbing, and I could only relate to some parts in the novel, because of what my friends have done.  <br />I would not reccomend reading this novel, unless you are very bored, or get it for free.  There are a lot better of books that can occupy your time pleasently.	2004-02-27

Emily encounters different relationships with various boys, and experiances true parties, hand holding, and the first kiss with a new boy. <br />I feel bad for Emily at her new strict school, but it's so very funny.  All the teachers make Emily sound as if she's a rebel who dreams of getting in trouble.  Emily wears too much makeup, too short of shorts, and doesn't know a thing of French.  <br />A very adorable book, a must read for any teenage girl.	2004-02-23
