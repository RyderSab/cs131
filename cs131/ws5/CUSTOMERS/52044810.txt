How many times must we read the same story (i.e., Kahlan is missing and Richard must rescue her OR Richard is missing and Kahlan must rescue him)?  While I enjoyed the depth of the relationship between Nicci and Richard, the rest of the characters never really developed any further than they had in previous books.  Overall a fun way to spend the time if you are a SOT fan.  The fantasy elements were stepped up a notch making for a fun read as well.  Let's hope volumes 10 & 11 return to make good on Goodkind's early promise.	2005-03-22

Gone is much of the overwriting and endless similies.  The characterizations are strong and some of the set pieces are gripping.  But these strong moments only make me long for the early Koontz.  His characters of late have all evolved to fit into two distinct categories: the pure and god-like or the truely evil, with little to no middle ground.  It's hard to identify with either of those extremes.  While ODD THOMAS held my attention and introduced several very interesting concepts and ideas, not all ideas were resolved (i.e., the black room), and the ending was very weak (which is another Koontz trademark).  I will continue to read Koontz since he remains one of the best popular novelists, but I do hope that he steps back from all of the soapbox stuff for a bit and gets back to having fun!	2004-12-29

My main problem with this book is the unoriginal plot twist upon which the book (and specifically its ending) is based.  But since this is a novelization of a movie script, this can't be blamed on Steven Piziks.  For the most part, this is a well-written novelization and very cinematic, but the characters never really came to life for me. So, do I rate the story or how the novelization was written?  I think to be fair, I need to consider both and that's why I only gave this book 2 stars.  A quick read at less than 300 pages and a somewhat engaging story, but taking all aspects into consideration, the book falls short.  I also thought the excessive use of the f-word was unnecessary.  I'm no prude, but the word's usage got to be tedious after a certain point.  I do think I will give Steven Piziks another try before striking him from my list of authors to read.	2004-04-25

The story takes far too long to get going.  Then, it falls into the same old story line that filled the pages of previous books.  Moreover, since TOW, the books have become less Fantasy and more political explorations with Fantasy overtones.  Gone are the great story telling and fantasy.  The SOT series is starting to go the way of the Wheel of Time series.  Goodkind is a great writer and I wish he'd write something on par with WFR or SOT again.  Worth a read for die-hard fans.	2003-07-27

First, one would assume that all of the research is primary because of the lack of sources cited.  However, throughout the book, &quot;sources&quot; are deferred to, but simply refer to them as an expert or authority.  What also concerns me is that the book is written around a single concept: eliminating the excess acid in the body.  One is lead to believe that this excess of acid is the reason for all man's ills, and if the plan is followed, disease (for the most part) will be eradicated.  I am weary of any single concept or magic pill (as it were) that can heal the world.  Finally, I got the impression that the book was written to sell the supplements recommended.  Again, I commend the authors for supporting the benefits of a plant-based diet and for providing some very tasty recipes, but I cannot recommend this book to someone truly wanting to make comprehensive changes to their diet.  Without the scientific documentation, the book just smells like junk science.	2003-05-20

While I enjoyed the pace and the in-your-face Sci-Fi storyline, I felt some of the story required a bit too much suspension of belief.  Without giving anything away, I found it very difficult to imagine a learned man like the lead character simply taking HOW he got into the library in stride, and then just accepting his situation just as easily.  If it weren't for this, I would have given the book 4 stars.  Other than this issue, and a few other plot holes, CONTEST was a great way to spend two evenings.  If you haven't read any of Reilly's work, then CONTEST is as good a place as any to begin to experience this young author.	2003-04-22

I instantly became one of the \\"worried well\\" as Dr. Whitaker puts it.  In any case, it became my mission not to end up dying of heart disease at a young age, so I started to buy and read every book I could find on the subject.  The most compelling and accessable program to date was that created by Dr. Dean Ornish.  With his help I lost 65 pounds and got my lipid profile and blood pressure under control; however, I was still hungry for more information about how this disease progresses and how I can prevent it, along with how I can reverse what has already started.  Dr. Whitaker's book was ideal in that regard.  I found Dr. Whitaker's book to be easy to read, easy to understand, and filled with data and advice I could implement into my life.  I really enjoyed the section wherein he discussed the various diagnostic tests and their respective predictibility.  This information was somewhat different than that which had been communicated to me by the various Cardiologists I have seen; however, Dr. Whitaker's information just \\"sounded right.\\"  Rather than using scare tactics like some of the other books I have read, Dr. Whitaker takes an objective approach.  When comparing Whitaker's book to Ornish's, the major difference I see is that Ornish has you limit fat intake to 10% a day, whereas Whitaker recommends 20%.  Unfortunately, and this is only one of a few issues I have with the book, Dr. Whitaker does not back up his case for fat intake to the extent that Ornish does.  So, I came away somewhat torn about how much fat I should be consuming.  Overall, this is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone who already has heart disease or to those who are at risk for heart disease.  I have already bought copies for my three brothers.	2003-03-14

Oddly, I prefer his non-Alex Cross novels (i.e., When the Wind Blows), so I had reserved hopes for The Jester.  Others have already given a synopsis, so I won't go into detail; however, I must admit that I could not put this book down.  I read it over three nights.  Each day I couldn't wait to get home from work so I could start reading again.  I read about 2 books a week, and I don't often come across a book that does that for me.  If you're hesitant because of the book's subject matter, don't be.  While some research was obviously done, this is a &quot;thriller,&quot; not a historical.  Highly recommended!	2003-03-06

I also had a cardiac scan and got a calcium score of 27.  Since I am only 38 years old, and have a strong family history of early heart disease, I was a bit overwhelmed with the direction of my health.  The Cardiologist suggested the Ornish program.  Within 6 months, I lost 54 pounds, my cholesterol is down to 119, my BP averages 109/70, and my cholesterol/HDL ratio is now 3.7.  I look better, and feel better too.  The &quot;diet&quot; does take some adjustment, but not as much as I thought.  I also thought I'd never be able to eat out, but that didn't happen either.  I still eat out 3X/week, but just feel better that I am making smart choices.  While no &quot;diet&quot; is 100%, and while some things others have said in their reviews tend to concern me, no other program has ever helped me get my BP, cholesterol and weight under control as well as Ornish.  They can say what they want, but I know I am healthier and will be less likely to &quot;go&quot; from a heart attack at 42 like my father.	2002-09-27

Only some of my beef comes from being mislead into believing that this entry into the series dealt with Richard et al; however, the majority of my criticism stems from one thing: the book is boring.  We are introduced to a few new characters who really never come to life, they just sort of plod through the story.  Granted, it was nice to get to see another side of the Goodkind world, but for 500+ pages not much happens.  I also felt the ending was too rushed.  It was like Goodkind said: &quot;oops, I've written 500 pages here, I better wrap this puppy up.&quot;  I also felt the villian and his troops were dispensed with too easily.  Why was it so easy to cause this much damage to the troops when in previous novels it took a great deal of effort.  It seems like even Goodkind may be getting tired of the story line as well.  Even though the book was written well, it went nowhere, the story was a take-it-or-leave-it, and the ending was rushed.  Overall, a VERY big disappointment.  I read an interview with Goodkind that said he wanted to write a book that someone new to the series could understand without having read the others in the series.  Well, in my opinion, it didn't work.  If I had not read the previous 6 volumes, I would have been totally lost.  Further, if this was my first Goodkind book, I might not well read another.  Come on, Terry, let's get back to basics and write something on par with Wizard's First Rule or Stone of Tears.  Also, if you decide to write something &quot;within the realm of&quot; the Sword of Truth, have your publisher label it as such.	2001-12-28

On the other hand, I very much enjoy Goodkind's writing style and his ability to tell a good story.  Pillars of Creation was a fast, fun read.  I just hope that this story, and its main character, become main players in the next three novels for which Goodkind has been contracted.

I recently re-read it in preparation for Black House and found it to be a completely different experience.  While I still found the story engrossing, I think it has suffered some through the years.  Much of the material has a very dated feel to it.  Not that this is a bad thing; most classical literature also has a dated feel, but that's part of the point.  The characters, even the secondary ones, come to life and move through this quest with a cinematic quality, which is more typical of King than Straub, but even with this quality, the book somewhat suffers under the weight of the quest in general.  It's almost like a series of short stories strung together to get to a common, designated end.  However, as a tremendous King fan (and much less of a Straub fan), I found the Talisman (on re-read) to be some of the strongest material these guys have produced.  I would definately recommend it to anyone unfamiliar with the authors' work.	2001-09-06

Not just in theme, either, but in overall &quot;feel.&quot;  I just couldn't help but think that King was having fun again; writing for the sheer joy of telling a good 'ol page turner.  Not his most intellectual work, but surely one of his most enjoyable.  Though the text comes in over 600 pages, I still found myself lost in the struggle of the wonderfully drawn characters, and page-flipping pace.  An old fashioned sci-fi extravaganza, told a la King-style.  In DREAMCATCHER, King once again creates memorable characters, and one of the most memorable is Duddits.  Duddits was not only the glue that held the gang together, he also served to hold the book together as well.  Familiar themes that include friendship, good vs evil, and an exploration into the human psyche make this one fun read.  Throughout, King begs us to answer: who are the real monsters?  Them or us?  A must read for King fans and those new to the author.	2001-04-30

With that in mind, I really wanted to like this book... but sometimes we don't get what we want. Like most Koontz novels, the characterization is excellent and the concept is unique; unfortunately, that's all this novel has going for it.  It's long-winded, full of trite phrasings, suffers under the weight of everyone's near perfection, and gets so cheesy in places that I found myself rolling my eyes.  Essentially, it is 600+ pages of fluff. I appreciate an author's desire to spread his or her literary wings, but not at the reader's expense.  If you're going to write something different, at least make it interesting....  Moreover, while Koontz traditionallyskips on the  endings of his books (they just seem to end all of a sudden), this is his worst ending bar far.  Several years worth of story are crammed in a very few pages, and then the book just ends...with a very forced ending. While I gave the book three stars, at least two of those stars were awarded on the basis of Koontz' previous efforts and works.  I will still buy Koontz, and he remains one of my favorite writers, but I will recommend to others that they wait until the book is released in paperback to try it.	2001-01-14

With that said, let me say that FOTF is not on par with Wizard's First Rule or Stone of Tears.  As always, Richard and Kahlan are vivid, well-drawn characters, and the story line and world building are some of the best in the field.  Goodkind has a way of transporting the reader into the story and making the reader experience along side of the characters.  The continuing story of The Order's progression into the New World is fascinating, and several of the battle scenes are gripping.  Unfortunately, the wrap-up is too rushed and contrived, and the storyline is a basic rehash of what Goodkind has written before.  Will I continue to spend my hard earned money on the next Sword of Truth book in hardback.  Most likely, but I am really looking forward to Goodkind producing the type of book he did early on in the series: fresh, exciting, and compelling.	2000-10-03

I bought the book on  a lark, and almost put it down after 50 pages, but there was  &quot;something&quot; about the book, so I kept reading...and, boy, am I  glad I did!  This book was incredible.  Incredible characters, storyline,  and writing.  While the story isn't all that fresh (it's like a sword and  sorcery version of Star Wars), but what Goodkind does with the material and  the characters is exceptional.  This book had such an impact on my reading  that I immediately bought and read the next two in the series, and then  bought books 4 and 5 in hardback.  I already have volume six pre-ordered.  From Goodkind, I went on to discover Feist, J.V. Jones, and Jordan.  Since  reading WFR, I have recommended it to many friends and co-workers, and have  converted many non-Fantasy fans via Mr. Goodkind.  Do yourself a favor and  pick up this book.  Period.	2000-08-14
US	52044810	RYRCH3G1AIQN4	038081093X	604551094	Excavation	Books	5	4	6	N	N	EXCEPTIONAL!!	James Rollins has done an incredible job with EXCAVATION.  The writing is  crisp, clear and very visual.  The story is fresh and inventive, and I  found myself holding my breath several times while reading it.  I can  honestly say that Mr. Rollins has become one of my favorite authors.  After  reading SUBTERRANEAN, I encouraged all of my friends to read it as well.  Now, after reading EXCAVATION, I have another great book to recommend!  You  just don't write them fast enough, Jim!  To sum up this incredible read, I  can honestly say that Mr. Rollins has out-Crichtoned Michael Crichton!	2000-07-09
US	52044810	R2VJNK0X0PI4M1	0812541642	819603580	Waiting	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Could Have Been More...	This book received so much positive hype, that I couldn't wait to read it.  Alas, the story never lived up to its potential.  The characters were FLAT, and the story uneven.  I kept reading because the concept was  exciting and I kept thinking: &quot;this is going to pick up and all gel  soon.&quot;  It never did.  The worst part was the constant thought I had  while reading it that it could have been an outstanding reading experiece  if someone like Koontz got hold of it!  It wasn't a complete waste of time  since I read it on a flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Phoenix, but I had hoped  for more.  I did enjoy Robinson's THE POWER however.  Check that one out.	2000-04-09

YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU is on par with THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, which is by far my favorite Clegg title.  YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU is fast paced and  populated with those quirky characters about which Clegg writes.  A MUST  BUY for all horror and suspense fans!	2000-03-14
US	52044810	R3022CHUN8FDQQ	8345410707	942543009	Witch Storm	Books	5	5	6	N	N	EXCELLENT NOVEL!	James Clemens is an exceptional writer. Wit'ch Storm just blew me away. The characters are  three dimensional, the writing is crisp, clean and cinimatic, and the story itself is relentless. I absolutely love the  overall dark nature of the magic and the villians. Mr. Clemens' is quickly  becoming one of my favorite authors. While I read 1 - 2 books a week,  there are only about 3 or 4 authors whose books I'd buy in hardback, or  even large paperback format, but Mr.Clemens is worth every cent. If you're  looking for other fantastic reads this summer, pick up Subterranean by  James Rollins (wink, wink).	1999-06-13

I am an avid reader of all types of fiction, but really enjoy well written Fantasy... and this novel is it.  While the storyline is somewhat familiar to avid readers of the genre, the  handling of the coming-of-age hero theme is one of the novel's strengths.  Specifically, the pacing is quite unlike other standards of the genre, like  Jordan, Brooks, or Goodkind; the pacing is brisk, almost thriller-like in  its execution.  This is a surprising and welcome relief for those of us who  sometimes get a bit antsy wading through 600 pages of setup before the  story actually begins to rock-n-roll (hello, Jordan, are you listening?!?).  I found the characters to be quite likeable, the storyline and plot  interesting, and the constant use of magic purely delightful.  If you like  a lot of magic in your Fantasy, this novel is a MUST READ.  I especially  liked the dark overtones to the magic. I do have one major criticism,  however: excessive use of apostrophies!  The overuse of the apostrophies  slapped me out of the whole reading experience more than once and made me  aware of the fact that I was reading rather than having the story unfold  before me. I can't wait until the next volume in the series.  Is it fair to  compare this author to such genre giants as Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, et  al?  Yes, quite fair indeed.  Well done.	1999-03-21
