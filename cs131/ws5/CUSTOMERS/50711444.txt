Wheezy Cough wrote, \\"If you think healthcare is expensive now, wait until its FREE.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />What Wheezy doesn't tell you that Americans ALREADY PAY MORE for their health care than other Western Democracies. If Wheezy were here to defend himself he would probably counter with,\\" Yeah, but American health care is the best.\\" Sorry Wheezy, American health care rates quite low on the list. So Americans in all their wisdom are making payments on a new '05 Mercedes but only getting to drive a '78 Ford LTD. But you see, Wheezy, like most Americans, doesn't travel and really believes he has it the best in all the world.  I live in Japan and have also lived in New Zealand and Australia, countries with Universal Health Care, and I would not trade US health care for the worst these countries have to offer. Michael Moore (I am not a fan) wondered why Americans die in such great numbers of gunshot wounds. Well, after living in countries where shooting deaths are a rarity I can offer an answer. People in Japan, UK, Australia, NZ, etc (Did you know that even ISRAEL has universal health care as well, paid for by US taxpayer dollars?) have the option of going to the doctor for help rather than turning to violence. So Whezzy if you ever find yourself with a gun barrel to your head ask yourself if Universal Health Care is as expensive as you thought.	2005-05-31

Mr. Singh lived the life of an ascetic in the Himalayas in the 1940's (not exactly sure about the date) and seems to have left some years later with a sense of clarity. Later he was involved in responding to the poverty in postwar India. In the 1950's he met Mr. J Krishnamurti in the USA who told him, \\"There are no problems apart from the mind.\\" The externals continued to have less and less hold of him until he met Helen Schuman, the Scribe of A Course in Miracles and his life was transformed. Helen encouraged him to teach the Course and he did for many years before retirement.     The true student of the Course will have to confront his own thought and this will take real dedication and honesty. Mr. Singh's words will not let the student hide from this challenge.	2004-09-24

Each section reviews the issues of dressing pertaining to that particular category. Basic stuff but necessary for the younger inexperienced man. This book's strong point is its explanation of the 4 dress codes: Corporate, Casual, Business Appropriate and Business Casual Appropriate along with business travel, entertainment and sales meetings. Its weak point is its lack of elegance and sophisticated masculinity. For that please see Alan Flusser's splendid book Dressing the Man.	2003-04-20

But first let me get to the good stuff: a lavish volume full of wonderful vintage photos, illustrations and well-written advice covering color, proportions, patterns, suits, odd jackets, trousers, waistcoats, dress shirts, neckwear, hosiery, shoes, accessorites, formalwear, and business casual. This volume won't age as you do as you refer to it again and again over the years. However, this book has two puzzling flaws: the chapter entitled THE POWER OF COLOR, while necessary, simply is lacking in content and the color photos DO NOT fit in with the rest of the artwork contained in the volume. In fact the photos cheapen this otherwise superb book. This goes for the BUSINESS CASUAL chapter as well: it seems lifted out of another book of lesser quality and inserted into this one. This book probably isn't for the man just out of college, the man for whom a pair of khakis is dressing up, nor the man who considers J Crew to be height of fashion  but highly recommended for the man ready to upgrade his appearance.	2003-03-16

Any one of her others in the series I'd give a 4 star rating at worst. Even the look of the cover has a look one wouldn't expect from this author--a cheesy romance.  She has changed publishers.  Could this have anything to do with the turn towards the worse her writing has taken? Normally her novels are serious page-turners for me, keeping me up to all hours of the morning, but I had to force myself over the course of several months to finish this one.

Christians living in the 1st and 2nd centuries too believed they were living in the End Times and countless millions of other Christians since have wasted their energies on foolishness.  They were ALL wrong.  Everyone of them. 100%.  Can people really be so foolish to believe that NOW is the end of the world?  Had you lived in Europe in the 14th century you would have good reason to believe that the world was coming to an end.  Many Christians did.  Again in 1914 and  in innumerable times in between people all over the world, Christian and non-Christian, have believed that the end was at hand. Please understand that prophecy is just that.  It is not a newspaper delivered from the future to the present.  It is metaphor and myth, with deep, multilayered meanings.  To read Bibical prophecy like an account of the daily news is like those who read the prophecies of Nostradamus in 1999 the same way and thought it was all over.  Man today has lost the ability to think metaphorically. This is the mistake. This is what is wrong and leads to foolishness.	2002-04-10

This author helped me to see something I have always felt but never really thought about, that churchgoers are boring and passionless.  Now I know why I don't go to church and do not enjoy the company of those who do. Thanks John! Now I don't have to feel guilty anymore!  As for the rest of the book, I won't rehash the fine reviews already posted but will note that the author quotes heavily from Robert Bly's IRON JOHN, a book I recommend any man to read.In fact, the author quotes alot period, too much really.  Another book worth reading because it details masculinity in its fulness is KING, WARRIOR, MAGICIAN, LOVER by Robert Moore.  I can only give this book three stars for the content isn't any where near the level of the two other men's books I have mentioned, but the author deserves praise for saying what many Christian men need to hear: look at yourself you wimp! You are not doing any body any good, including yourself, by making Jesus into a meek and mild Mr.Rogers-type and following that projection.  You ARE meant for something bigger than church suppers!  Your youthful dreams can't be shoved aside in the name of God, duty and family for they will prevail if only to make you miserable because you didn't follow your heart.	2001-12-29

The negative reviews for this translation remind me of the American congressman in the 1980's who said in response to the debate to make English the offical language of the USA, &quot;If English was good enough for Jesus, it is good enough for me.&quot;<br />This is the first translation that has really spoken me and I am not an uneducated guy; I enjoyed Latin and Anglo-Saxon in college and am comfortable reading all the obsolete pronouns and verb forms of the King James Version, but it was all just words.<br />I read once where the word that Jesus used for God translates into English as 'daddy' and not 'Father'.

There is enough of that in the earlier reviews.  So much of it that you may become nauseated.  I will say that most students of the Course seem to gravitate to one or more of the many authors who make a living promoting the Course.  You probably will too.  I think that they all have good intentions but there is one that is different from all the rest, a gentleman by the name of Tara Singh.  What integrity! He is impeccable. He actually knew the Scribe of the Course, and Jiddu Krishnamurti, Prime Minister Nehru, Elanor Roosevelt, and the Dali Lama's teacher among others. You probably are going to buy a Course-related book so I'd suggest one of his.  He has a loftiness in him that is rare today, a wisdom that few beings in this age can impart.

Yes, UG rants and raves about Jiddu but I think that it is UG who 'got' what the older Jiddu talked about for all those years.  All those JK devotees who complain about UGK should take a good look at themselves and use that awareness that JK talked of so often and see what they are doing:  defending their position just as Christians and other religious people do.  All real mystics outgrow their own religious backgrounds and give something new to the world and this is what UGK has done:  he outgrew JK, a light to the world, and became one himself and not just another devotee.

Upon reading it you will see that Dale Carnegie's book has a noble lineage and that his advice is nothing new and is not merely to get what one wants by influencing others but, as Chesterfield wrote, &quot;Merit and knowledge will not gain hearts, though they will secure them when gained.  Engage the eyes by your address, air, and motions;  soothe the ears, by the elegancy and harmony of your diction, the heart will certainly follow, and the whole man or woman will as certainly follow the heart.  I must repeat it to you, over and over again, that, with all the knowledge which you may have at present, or hereafter acquire, and with all the merit that ever man had, if you have not a graceful address, liberal and engaging manners, a prepossessing air, and a good sense of eloquence in speaking and writing, YOU WILL BE A NOBODY.&quot;	2000-11-07

Course students are attracted to these kind of books because the Couse is not easy. It takes attention and dedication. Cliff Notes on the Course. The Course Lite.
