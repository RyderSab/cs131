I love books about the industrial revolution and the Robber Barons.  Although not defined as a Robber Baron, she amassed the bulk of her fortune(albeit from a hefty inheritance) during this period.  Slack takes a sympathetic view of Hetty and tries to dispell the popular notion of her as mean, tight-fisted and petty; it often looks as if he is trying too hard.  It is hard to ignore the facts, and while some stories about her are proven untrue, the majority are shown to be accurate.  <br /> <br />My main wish is that Slack would have delved more into the details of how she amassed such an enormous fortune. At 242 pages, he left much unsaid.  The light brush strokes that Slack painted left much to be desired.  I wanted more than to know that she had interests all over the country and that she made her fortune by lending money and acquired property by foreclosing on properties she held the mortgage on.  Were these properties the bulk of her fortune?  She also held millions in bonds.  What was the breakdown of her holdings at various times? Who helped her in these endeavors?  How did word spread all over the country that she was one to come to as a hard money lender?  How did she amass such a fortune just by lending money at 2-4%?  She could not have built such a fortune as she did in her lifetime by using just this technigue.  I wanted more and these questions and others are what I was left wanting an answer to after I had finished reading. The devil is in the details and Slack did not provide many.  This is the main knock I have with Slack's effort.  Chernow's \\"Titan\\" and Krass's \\"Carnegie\\" are examples of the effort one their subjects that one should read.	2005-04-03

A very detailed look into the life of one of the foremost figures of the industrial revolution.  Krass really did his homework and presents an interesting character study.  Carnegie basically built his fortune(as did others at the time) using then legal, while ethically questionable, inside information.  Incredibly merciless to his workers, management and competitors, he was able to somewhat redeem himself in his later years by philanthropically giving his fortune away.  This book is a very detailed look into a very different age.	2005-02-08

What he ended up with is a fascinating book on the lives of other families of Texas settlers who had children abducted and also their frontier lifestyles. Also included are the stories of not just his ancestor Adolph Korn, but other children who were Indian abductees as well.  Incredibly well researched (especially for an Aggie.) He leaves no stone unturned.  The stories these abductees had of their lives with the different tribes are absolutely fascinating.  Not having read much before about Indian abductions, especially intriquing was how difficult re-assimilation back to their native white culture was for these former child abductees.  Even if they had only spent a few months with the Indians. A great factual look back at what life on frontier was like.  Highly recommended.	2005-01-13

A little better at the math than most, in that it actually covers numbers.  Yes, the book is 8 yrs old and the interest rates used are a little out of line, but the formulas are the same.  One beef I have with books like these is that they rely way too much on appreciation to make an investment successful.  Tanzer uses 5%!  Yes this happens in certain areas, but never on a consistent basis, and definitely not in all areas.  The way to invest and not speculate is to not count on inflation or even appreciation in your purchase numbers, then when it happens its just tacked on as a bonus when you sell the property.  <br />His info on where to find funds is pretty basic.

He didnt go back as a gambler, but to get where the real money is, with intentions on becoming a casino owner.  After more than 7 years(most of them in Australia - you'll have to read it) he had acguired a substantial grubstake and headed off to Vegas.  He runs an ad in the paper looking investment opportunities.  Although the ad did not directly produce investment results, it did provide him with some very important connections. He buys a vacant lot far off the strip, gets licensed, builds a casino, adds a hotel and self-promotes his ass off.  To fill in the blanks and know the rest, you gotta read it yourself.  He even had ties, loosely at best, to Anthony Spiltro, the real life mobster the Joe Pesci character was based on in Casino.  I love this one.	2004-04-20

How was this man not caught sooner?  It shows how greed affects us all.  The seemingly educated, powerful people that Frankel was able to take in with his house of cards was amazing.<br />That he did most of the damage while still living at his parents house in Toledo, OH makes it even more amazing.  Here is a man who was facinated with financial markets which he read about and studied for over 10,000 self confessed hours.  He knew brokers and investors at all the major brokerage houses near his home.  He was a &quot;paper trader&quot; and was more often than not correct.  Yet he couldnt bring himself to pull the trigger and actually trade.<br />The gist of the scheme was started when Frankel started a phony stock brokerage and used a ponzi scheme to lure investors. But he was too afraid to make trades for his customers.   He then decided to use his ill-gotten cash to buy a bank and in the process of shopping for one he came accross a &quot;pre-need buriel insurance&quot; firm that was in play.

These guys supposedly based their business around REO properties.  Usually buying from the bank after the foreclosure process for 25% less than market value.  They must live in an area with absolutely NO competition.  Where I live everybody and their dog is after these types of properties, thus it is impossible to buy these houses for this type of discount.  If you can get one it will be a DOG and you had better be ready to pour some money in it to get it sellable.<br />Another beef is with their numbers.  They assume at one point purchasing a house with a mortgage for $67500 say that your PITI(principal, interest, taxes and insurance) will be $500.  They then say you can rent this type of house for $1000.  Not in my neck of the woods.  Be sure to check your local numbers for insurance and taxes and rental rates.<br />That said, I do like their Rent-to-Own sales plan and the premise that someone renting-to own will take better care of the property than a transient renter would.  I also like their breakdown  of the six profits centers they look for in each property.<br />If you are looking for a way to get started in real estate I recommend their plan once you have purchased the property, I just wouldnt limit yourself to just trying to fight for REO houses.  There are many opportunities for buying houses for less than market price, just do your homework and don't limit yourself.	2004-04-06

The story of how this man molded himself and steeled his Will is a fascinating account of how one can accept limitations placed on him(physical or mental) or choose to set out on a path of his own making.  And this has nothing to do with economics (regarding his privlidged upbringing and future success say like a Donald Trump who claims to have made his fortune himself while being a product of a millionaire father) but a man systematically conquering each of his fears one by one and forging a future for himself.<br />His account of his stint is prison for his involvement in Watergate is worth the price of the book alone.	2004-04-06

Even build rental houses and own them for below market prices.  This is basically what builders do. <br />There is some very good advice on choosing a buildable lot and &quot;value engineering&quot; or how to design the home to get the most for your money. <br />He covers good, basic tenets such as borrowing ideas from plans, model homes, and other houses already built so you can incorporate successful ideas already implemented.  His reasoning being you cant come up with a new idea in home design anyway, and you dont want to for resale purposes (you dont want the only house with your different design elements on the block - it will hinder resale.)	2004-04-05

Nowhere on the cover does the book mention anything about flipping.  I also wonder if they bothered to read it.  It clearly does not advocate becoming a &quot;slum lord&quot;.  It recommends against investing in these types of properties.  It does recommend investing in older neighborhoods, in fact on pg. 97 it breaks down the 5 general types of areas or neighborhoods in most towns or cities and tells you exactly where to invest.<BR>  As far as flipping, if you follow Jay's advice instead of renting you could then sell.  The book is all about how to find these types of properties and how to purchase them for the right price( As most real estate investors know, the profit is made in the purchase.)  <br />Starting on pg. 56 he offers 4 ways to find such properties.<br />On pg. 73 he tells you step by step what to do when you find such a property.<br />On pg. 86 how to find the right real estate agent to help you.<br />It covers negotiating, fix-up strageties, where the profit centers to each deal are, financing and refinancing,finding partners, other avenues for investment monies and landlording skills towards the END of the book.<br />I really thought this a practical book full of good advice for the beginner.	2004-03-28

I cant believe that this reviewer believes that corporate &quot;welfare&quot; disproves the thesis of this book.  How moronic can one be?  The difference dear child is that corporations still are in business and trying to produce a profit.  An individual on welfare does nothing to earn an income, or very little at most.  Thus the incintive not to work.  Corporate welfare  is just as incidious in my book, but at least the corporation is trying to profit from as many revenue centers as it can.	2004-03-24

Thom did an incredible job \\"filling in\\" the details if you will, of Ingles incredible story.  Something that few, if none of us can relate to these days.  This one had actually slipped under the radar until my wife pointed it out to me, as it was not required reading where I went to school.  But I feel that I appreciate it even more now than I would have then.  <br />A warning though, much of it is quite gruesome, and it does not portray Indians in a soft, \\"lets make white people feel ashamed for what they did \\" modern manner.  It sheds light into certain savagery committed by Indians that is not heard much in the days of political correctness and bending over backwards to appease.  Parts of this book are very disturbing and very,very brutal.<br />But I think this \\"punch in the face\\" style of not holding anything back is the beauty of the book.  It presents the story as it happened, stripped bare for all to see.  You will appreciate the hardship.	2002-02-26

Dan is one of my favorite authors, but this is not Dan's best work. He seemed to have lost his spark on this one. I was very ready for a sequal to &quot;Dead Solid Perfect,&quot; one of the funniest books ever written. But this one did not deliver. The golf history is interesting, but wears old. It seems that this effort might actually be a little too close to the boring truth regarding the touring life of a PGA tour member. The book goes from one tour stop to the next describing what everyone in Bobby Joe's party had to eat at the restaurant and describing what everyone was wearing. Then he describes every course Bobby Joe plays at and the history involved in its design. The humor is much tamer and not as funny as &quot;Dead Solid Perfect.&quot; One note on the editorial review, probably just a mis-type, but his last book was 15 years ago, not 25. It was &quot;Life its Ownself,&quot; a prequal to &quot;Semi-Tough,&quot; and a much funnier book than this.	2001-09-06

An incredibly funny account of golf, shapely adorables, gambling hustles and general all around characters. I laughed out loud so hard I cried a couple of times. The bit about Kenny Lee Puckett and Spec Reynolds creating a fictional West Texas town in order to bet on the football team and try and pull one over on their bookie is pure genius(dont worry, I gave nothing away). In todays smoothed over, politically correct world this throwback is actually quite unlike anything you will read. I have read this book twice I liked it so much. Order one used if you cant get it new.	2001-08-24

The authors obsession and anal-retentiveness make for a hard read. Here is a three- handicapper that decides to take the plunge and do what all of us golfers dream about. He then procedes to ruin his game and the story by being obsessed with every bit of minutia about his swing and then analyzing his swing to death. It just goes on and on. There are much better books than this on the subject. Try &quot;Tin Cup Dreams&quot; and &quot;Bud, Sweat and Tees&quot;.	2001-08-21

It takes you to golfing venues and places that others dont.  If you want a book about a player you know or courses and tournaments you are familiar with, then this is not your book.  That, however, is the redeeming factor of this book.  It does get dry because of that though, as it does the usual, painful breakdown of all of Ross Drummond's (Ross who?...exactly)shots and putts.  This of course it what drops its rating down. A book like this on Tiger might rate 5 stars as we would all like to hear the inside scoop from his caddy.     Where it does excel is with Donegan's wit, humor and exploits.  When their relationship starts to sour Donegan takes more of an interest in his social life, and in places like Morocco you know it will get interesting.  Chapter seven on his experience in Rabat is  pretty dang funny.	2001-08-21

Shipnuck picked the right guys at the right time to follow and write about.  Beem's rookie year was sensational to say the least.  The pairing of a self described &quot;Army Brat&quot; and his dysfunctional caddie provide just the right combination for a book of this sort.   Besides the look at these two and their wild life, the book does a wonderful job giving insight into how the Tour ticks. Beem does a great job describing how there are basically two tours, the one for the superstars and one for the up-and-comers and also-rans and the difficulty in overcoming the odds to become one of those upper eschelon types. One of the most entertaining and enthralling aspects of the book is the look at how rookies put together sponsership deals and also how endorsment deals work once on tour.  Shipnuck gives you all the monetary details of how it all works.     That he hooked up with two such interesting characters at such a pivotal time in both of their careers is akin to catching the proverbial lightning in a bottle.  Oh yeah, lets not forget the travel, partying, gambling and womanizing.	2001-07-24

It covers real estate from a professional angle.  It covers how to study the macro-environment in real estate and how it influences everyone in r.e. from the entrepreneur to the reit professional.<br />It's premise in analyzing properties is the &quot;back of envelope&quot; analysis. There is time to use a spreadsheet and do a thorough analysis later, but when presented an oppurtunity you need to act quick.  B.O.E. analysis is a super quick, easy, first step number crunching  technique that uses raw data to give you a basis to decide to either pursue or not pursue a certain investment. Instead of focusing on &quot;location, location, location&quot; it follows the premise of &quot;learn the dynamics of how locations change, and figure out how that knowledge can help you buy and sell properties.&quot;<br />From the jacket, &quot;Poorvu shows readers how to use direct investments, syndicates, and REITS to get into the real estate game across a broad range of property types: residential, office, hotel, industrial and retail.&quot;  Not the &quot;buy single family residential rental properties type of book,&quot; but an actual practical, professional look at real estate for those wanting to go more &quot;big time&quot;.	2001-07-04

Gindick tells and explains all.  From how to choose a harmonica to helping you pick a mike and amp to play live with by the end.  You cant go wrong here.  Not too heavy on theory(and thats probably a good thing, most original bluesmen couldnt read print, much less music)....why let it get in the way of good music? However he does give you a foundation and the vital I-IV-V blues progression.  Laymans terms though, nothing to technical. <br />Using his fictitional tribe of ancients who just discovered a harmonica, he lays it all down for you. He boils blues harp down to its basic feeling, that it is a language of tension and release, something you have to feel and live.  He gives you all the basics: individual notes, chords, too numerous to mention techniques, even a couple of pages on harp repair.  <br />What I like is his inclusion of not only simple songs and how to spruce them up with your new found techinques, but actual blues licks that can be used to improv with or to use when playing along with a garage sitdown or eventually a stage jam.  So many instuctionals leave this out.  <br />The indexed 74 track play along CD instructional is the kicker.  It actually lets you hear how you should sound.  Allows you to get the tone down that is so hard do on your own when just starting out. Even lets you turn the band accompaniment or the harmonica sound off, so you can hear just what you need.<br />The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that the CD is a little disjointed from the book.  I wish it would have more closely followed it.  Probably a 4 1/2.	2001-06-26

Includes practice routines and drills, equipment needed, course management, grip, distance control,  shots for every situation(rough, sand, backspin, chipping, and even a little on putting and much more), as well as a list of golf schools if you REALLY need help. Even lists who and what to watch for when watching golf on TV. I love \\"Idiot's\\" books for reference, this one included, for their great indexing and detailed contents pages that let you go directly to a section without reading the whole book if you are looking for an instant solution to one particular problem.

Things have changed alot since '94 when he performed his feat and kept this journal. There is even more competition among the casinos and even newer technology to aid the casinos.
