I couldn't wait to read this - despite my mixed emotions about Neil Young's wishes (there was a lawsuit between the author and with Neil Young trying to prevent the publication of this). The book, 10 years in the writing, was written with the help and aid of Neil Young and his circle of friends and collegues. The book is intimate and explores Neil Young beyond the typical super star bio. <br />Indepth look at his relationship to his family. His hobbies - (i.e Lionel Trains!). And his life behind the stage. His feelings for his native land - Canada. And much more.<br />The book confirms and fills in details about what an awesome and multifaceted artist Neil Young is.	2002-05-07

I was cautious about a &quot;War&quot; book for kids - worried that the historical tragedy and horrors of war would be either too graphic or transformed in macho-heroism. This book does neither.<br />This book is very well balanced history book. It lays out the historical facts, interspersed with quality and relevent anecdotes and personal events.

Before reading this book I enjoyed Stephen Ambrose's personal style of writing and presenting history. A few years I was saddened when he said that he &quot;wasn't going to study war no more&quot; after the conclusion of Citizen Soldiers (I think he even gave away his entire military library to a University!).<br />His return to presenting the exploits of the people that won our freedom in World War Two is appreciated. I find his books - collections of personal stories - to be much more real and less sterile than traditional history books.<br />If you enjoy Ambrose's style from his other great books you won't be disappointed. The heroism and dedication of my grand father's generation shine's through.	2001-09-07

The book is very good and seems to be honest. Quite readable.<br />This book should be on the reading list of anyone interested in probing what the heck Picasso was about.

The author may place a little too much emphasis on the reliance the Nazi's had on I.B.M.<br />However, as some of the past reviews have indicated, this topic has pulled some intense strings. I read this book immediately after rereading THE classic book on World War two espionage &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;. Much of this latter book documents how the the British and Canadians were trying to covertly and overtly stop American companies from dealing with the Nazis from 1939-41.<br />Both books demonstrate the lack of national affiliation or interest in peace &amp; humanity held by the largest corporations in America. <br />Crown's book is good to remind us of what a large corporation will do to make money.	2001-03-10

While I am not a political scientist - I haven't been exposed to this side of American political history. It is a history that certainly has not been in vogue during the last eight Clinton years.<br />The book is very accessbile. It is also supported with copious amounts of research and peppered with interesting stories and anecdotes. The style of the book reminds one of a Stephen Ambrose history - full of personalities, eye witness accounts and a coherent story. This book humanizes the people that are often villified by the left in the standard history of the '60s. Their brilliance and their short-comings both show through.<br />Regardless of your political leanings (or neutrality), understanding the roots of Bush politics is essentially what you will get out of this book.<br />The book is timely!	2001-03-07

I enjoy reading the exploits of Franklin, Shackleton, Cooke, and such sea borne explorers.<br />One of the constants of all of the fantastic voyages of exploration is the inclusion of a physician / scientist. Almost in cliche style these doctors play a major role in the direction and guidance of the expedition. (If you will pardon the comparison, most ships doctors seem just like Bones on Star Trek.) <br />This book gathers together the biographies, anecdotes and histories of many of these physicians into a conherent historical theme. <br />Great book!!

The topic is the same (the &quot;common person&quot;'s experiences in the war) but it is a compleatly different format.<br />This book is a portable archive from the civil war. Instead of being a narrative description of the civil war as seen by &quot;common folk&quot; it allows these charaters to speak for themselves through letters, diaries, and a variety of correspondance. Lots of photos. <br />I live too far away to visit a Civil war museum - this is the next best thing. You can draw your own inferences and interpretations from the letters and orders. Some are eye openning and show how times have changed; others show how similar these folks were to the 21st century folk.<br />Book is well worth owning!	2001-01-07

This is a collection of letters that the author wrote to his wife, along with sketches and paintings, that capsulate his thoughts, feelings and experiences.<br />I really enjoy reading Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin's letters, essays and sketches and cartoons. However, they were written with me (or my parents) as an audience. Tracy Sugerman's letters were never really intended to be published and this adds a degree of depth, candor and emotion which cannot be found in the professional writer's works.<br />I've also read most of Stephen Ambrose's books on World War II and feel that Sugerman's letters bring alive one soldier's viewpoints about life in a manner that is much more powerful than Ambrose's brief glimpses and interviews with the vets found in all of his books (though each has its place &amp; Ambrose's books are 5/5!).	2000-10-24
